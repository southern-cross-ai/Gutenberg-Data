  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">I STOPPED on the way to the Staten Island Airport to call
  up, and that was a mistake, doubtless, since I had a chance of making it
  otherwise. But the office was affable. "We'll hold the ship five minutes for
  you," the clerk said. "That's the best we can do."</p>

  <p>So I rushed back to my taxi and we spun off to the third level and sped
  across the Staten Bridge like a comet treading a steel rainbow. I had to be
  in Moscow by evening, by eight o'clock in fact, for the opening of bids on
  the Ural Tunnel. The Government required the personal presence of an agent of
  each bidder, but the firm should have known better than to send me, Dixon
  Wells, even though the N. J. Wells Corporation is, so to speak, my father. I
  have a&mdash;well, an undeserved reputation for being late to everything;
  something always comes up to prevent me from getting anywhere on time. It's
  never my fault; this time it was a chance encounter with my old physics
  professor, old Haskel van Manderpootz. I couldn't very well just say hello
  and good-bye to him; I'd been a favorite of his back in the college days of
  2014.</p>

  <p>I missed the airliner, of course. I was still on the Staten Bridge when I
  heard the roar of the catapult and the Soviet rocket Baikal hummed over us
  like a tracer bullet with a long tail of flame.</p>

  <p>We got the contract anyway; the firm wired our man in Beirut and he flew
  up to Moscow, but it didn't help my reputation. However, I felt a great deal
  better when I saw the evening papers; the Baikal, flying at the north edge of
  the eastbound lane to avoid a storm, had locked wings with a British
  fruitship and all but a hundred of her five hundred passengers were lost. I
  had almost become "the late Mr. Wells" in a grimmer sense.</p>

  <p>I'd made an engagement for the following week with old van Manderpootz. It
  seems he'd transferred to N.Y.U. as head of the department of Newer Physics
  &mdash;that is, of Relativity. He deserved it; the old chap was a genius if
  ever there was one, and even now, eight years out of college, I remember more
  from his course than from half a dozen in calculus, steam and gas, mechanics,
  and other hazards on the path to an engineer's education, So on Tuesday night
  I dropped in an hour or so late, to tell the truth, since I'd forgotten about
  the engagement until mid-evening.</p>

  <p>He was reading in a room as disorderly as ever. "Humph!" he granted. "Time
  changes everything but habit, I see. You were a good student, Dick, but I
  seem to recall that you always arrived in class toward the middle of the
  lectures."</p>

  <p>"I had a course in East Hall just before," I explained. "I couldn't seem
  to make it in time."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's time you learned to be on time," he growled. Then his eyes
  twinkled. "Time!" he ejaculated. "The most fascinating word in the language.
  Here we've used it five times (there goes the sixth time&mdash;and the
  seventh!) in the first minute of conversation; each of us understands the
  other, yet science is just beginning to learn its meaning, Science? I mean
  that I am beginning to learn."</p>

  <p>I sat down. "You and science are synonymous," I grinned. "Aren't you one
  of the world's outstanding physicists?"</p>

  <p>"One of them!" he snorted. "One of them! And who are the others?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Corveille and Hastings and Shrimski &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bah! Would you mention them in the same breath with the name of van
  Manderpootz? A pack of jackals, eating the crumbs of ideas that drop from my
  feast of thoughts! Had you gone back into the last century, now&mdash;had you
  mentioned Einstein and de Sitter&mdash;there, perhaps, are names worthy to
  rank with (or just below) van Manderpootz!"</p>

  <p>I grinned again in amusement. "Einstein was considered pretty good, wasn't
  he?" I remarked. "After all, he was the first to tic time and space to the
  laboratory. Before him they were just philosophical concepts."</p>

  <p>"He didn't!" rasped the professor. "Perhaps, in a dim, primitive fashion,
  he showed the way, but I&mdash;I, van Manderpootz&mdash;am the first to seize
  time, drag it into my laboratory, and perform an experiment on it."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? And what sort of experiment?"</p>

  <p>"What experiment, other than simple measurement, is it possible to
  perform?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;I don't know. To travel in it?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"Like these time-machines that are so popular in the current magazines? To
  go into the future or the past?"</p>

  <p>"Bah! Many bahs! The future or the past&mdash;pfui! It needs no van
  Manderpootz to see the fallacy in that. Einstein showed us that much."</p>

  <p>"How? It's conceivable, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Conceivable? And you, Dixon Wells, studied under van Manderpootz!" He
  grew red with emotion, then grimly calm. "Listen to me. You know how time
  varies with the speed of a system&mdash;Einstein's relativity."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now suppose then that the great engineer Dixon Wells invents a
  machine capable of traveling very fast, enormously fast, nine-tenths as fast
  as light. Do you follow? Good. You then fuel this miracle ship for a little
  jaunt of a half-million miles, which, since mass (and with it inertia)
  increases according to the Einstein formula with increasing speed, takes all
  the fuel in the world. But you solve that. You use atomic energy. Then, since
  at nine-tenths light-speed, your ship weighs about as much as the sun, you
  disintegrate North America to give you sufficient motive power. You start off
  at that speed, a hundred and sixty-eight thousand miles per second, and you
  travel for two hundred and four thousand miles. The acceleration has now
  crushed you to death, but you have penetrated the future." He paused,
  grinning sardonically. "Haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And how far?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Use your Einstein formula!" he screeched. "How far? I'll tell you. One
  second!" He grinned triumphantly. "That's how possible it is to travel into
  the future. And as for the past&mdash;in the first place, you'd have to
  exceed light-speed, which immediately entails the use of more than an
  infinite number of horsepowers. We'll assume that the great engineer Dixon
  Wells solves that little problem too, even though the energy output of the
  whole universe is not an infinite number of horsepowers. Then he applies this
  more than infinite power to travel at two hundred and four thousand miles per
  second for ten seconds. He has then penetrated the past. How far?"</p>

  <p>Again I hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you. One second!" He glared at me. "Now all you have to do is
  to design such a machine, and then van Manderpootz; will admit the
  possibility of traveling into the future&mdash;for a limited number of
  seconds. As for the past, I have just explained that all the energy in the
  universe is insufficient for that."</p>

  <p>"But," I stammered, "you just said that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did not say anything about traveling into either future or past, which
  I have just demonstrated to you to be impossible&mdash;a practical
  impossibility in the one case and an absolute one in the other."</p>

  <p>"Then how do you travel in time?"</p>

  <p>"Not even van Manderpootz can perform the impossible," said the professor,
  now faintly jovial. He tapped a thick pad of typewriter paper on the table
  beside him. "See, Dick, this is the world, the universe." He swept a finger
  down it. "It is long in time, and"&mdash;sweeping his hand across it
  &mdash;"it is broad in space, but"&mdash;now jabbing his finger against its
  center&mdash;"it is very thin in the fourth dimension. Van Manderpootz takes
  always the shortest, the most logical course. I do not travel along time,
  into past or future. No. Me, I travel across time, sideways!"</p>

  <p>I gulped. "Sideways into time! What's there?"</p>

  <p>"What would naturally be there?" he snorted. "Ahead is the future; behind
  is the past. Those are real, the worlds of past and future. What worlds are
  neither past nor future, but contemporary and yet&mdash;extemporal&mdash;
  existing, as it were, in time parallel to our time?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" he snapped. "The conditional worlds, of course! The worlds of
  'if.' Ahead are the worlds to be; behind are the worlds that were; to either
  side are the worlds that might have been&mdash;the worlds of if!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" I was puzzled. "Do you mean that you can see what will happen if I
  do such and such?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he snorted. "My machine does not reveal the past nor predict the
  future. It will show, as I told you, the conditional worlds. You might
  express it, by 'if I had done such and such, so and so would have happened.'
  The worlds of the subjunctive mode."</p>

  <p>"Now how the devil does it do that?"</p>

  <p>"Simple, for van Manderpootz! I use polarized light, polarized not in the
  horizontal or vertical planes, but in the direction of the fourth dimension
  &mdash;an easy matter. One uses Iceland spar under colossal pressure, that is
  all. And since the worlds are very thin in the direction of the fourth
  dimension, the thickness of a single light wave, though it be but millionths
  of an inch, is sufficient. A considerable improvement over time-traveling in
  past or future, with its impossible velocities and ridiculous distances!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;are those&mdash;worlds of if&mdash;real?"</p>

  <p>"Real? What is real? They are real, perhaps, in the sense that two is a
  real number as opposed to V-2, which is imaginary. They are the worlds that
  would have been if&mdash;Do you see?"</p>

  <p>I nodded. "Dimly. You could see, for instance, what New York would have
  been like if England had won the Revolution instead of the Colonies."</p>

  <p>"That's the principle, true enough, but you couldn't see that on the
  machine. Part of it, you see, is a Horsten psychomat (stolen from one of my
  ideas, by the way) and you, the user, become part of the device. Your own
  mind is necessary to furnish the background. For instance, if George
  Washington could have used the mechanism after the signing of peace, he could
  have seen what you suggest. We can't. You can't even see what would have
  happened if I hadn't invented the thing, but I can. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. You mean the background has to rest in the past experiences of
  the user."</p>

  <p>"You're growing brilliant," he scoffed. "Yes. The device will show ten
  hours of what would have happened if&mdash;condensed, of course, as in a
  movie, to half an hour's actual time's "Say, that sounds interesting!"</p>

  <p>"You'd like to see it? Is there anything you'd like to find out? Any
  choice you'd alter?"</p>

  <p>"I'll say&mdash;a thousand of 'em. I'd like to know what would have
  happened if I'd sold out my stocks in 2009 instead of '10. I was a
  millionaire in my own right then, but I was a little&mdash;well, a little
  late in liquidating."</p>

  <p>"As usual," remarked van Manderpootz. "Let's go over to the laboratory
  then."</p>

  <p>The professor's quarters were but a block from the campus. He ushered me
  into the Physics Building, and thence into his own research laboratory, much
  like the one I had visited during my courses under him. The device&mdash;he
  called it his "subjunctivisor," since it operated in hypothetical worlds
  &mdash;occupied the entire center table. Most of it was merely a Horsten
  psychomat, but glittering crystalline and glassy was the prism of Iceland
  spar, the polarizing agent that was the heart of the instrument.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz pointed to the headpiece. "Put it on," he said, and I sat
  staring at the screen of the psychomat. I suppose everyone is familiar with
  the Horsten psychomat; it was as much a fad a few years ago as the ouija
  board a century back. Yet it isn't just a toy; sometimes, much as the ouija
  board, it's a real aid to memory. A maze of vague and colored shadows is
  caused to drift slowly across the screen, and one watches them, meanwhile
  visualizing whatever scene or circumstances he is trying to remember. He
  turns a knob that alters the arrangement of lights and shadows, and when, by
  chance, the design corresponds to his mental picture&mdash;presto! There is
  his scene re-created under his eyes. Of course his own mind adds the details.
  All the screen actually shows are these tinted blobs of light and shadow, but
  the thing can be amazingly real. I've seen occasions when I could have sworn
  the psychomat showed pictures almost as sharp and detailed as reality itself;
  the illusion is sometimes as startling as that.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz switched on the light, and the play of shadows began. "Now
  recall the circumstances of, say, a half-year after the market crash. Turn
  the knob until the picture clears, then stop. At that point I direct the
  light of the subjunctivisor upon the screen, and you have nothing to do but
  watch."</p>

  <p>I did as directed. Momentary pictures formed and vanished. The inchoate
  sounds of the device hummed like distant voices, but without the added
  suggestion of the picture, they meant nothing. My own face flashed and
  dissolved and then, finally, I had it. There was a picture of myself sitting
  in an ill-defined room; that was all. I released the knob and gestured.</p>

  <p>A click followed. The light dimmed, then brightened. The picture cleared,
  and amazingly, another figure emerged, a woman, I recognized her; it, was
  Whimsy White, erstwhile star of television and premiere actress of the
  "Vision Varieties of '09." She was changed on that picture, but I recognized
  her.</p>

  <p>I'll say I did! I'd been trailing her all through the boom years of '07 to
  '10, trying to marry her, while old N. J. raved and ranted and threatened to
  leave everything to the Society for Rehabilitation of the Gobi Desert. I
  think those threats were what kept her from accepting me, but after I took my
  own money and ran it up to a couple of million in that crazy market of '08
  and '09, she softened.</p>

  <p>Temporarily, that is. When the crash of the spring of '10 came and bounced
  me back on my father and into the firm of N. J. Wells, her favor dropped a
  dozen points to the market's one. In February we were engaged, in April
  &mdash;we were hardly speaking. In May they sold me out. I'd been late
  again.</p>

  <p>And now, there she was on the psychomat screen, obviously plumping out,
  and not nearly so pretty as memory had pictured her. She was staring at me
  with an expression of enmity, and I was glaring back. The buzzes became
  voices.</p>

  <p>"You nit-wit!" she snapped. "You can't bury me out here. I want to go back
  to New York, where there's a little life. I'm bored with you and your
  golf."</p>

  <p>"And I'm bored with you and your whole dizzy crowd."</p>

  <p>"At least they're alive. You're a walking corpse! Just because you were
  lucky enough to gamble yourself into the money, you think you're a tin
  god."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't think you're Cleopatra! Those friends of yours&mdash;they
  trail after you because you give parties and spend money&mdash;my money."</p>

  <p>"Better than spending it to knock a white walnut along a
  mountainside!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed? You ought to try it, Marie." (That was her real name.) "It might
  help your figure&mdash;though I doubt if anything could!"</p>

  <p>She glared in rage and&mdash;well, that was a painful half-hour. I won't
  give all the details, but I was glad when the screen dissolved into
  meaningless colored clouds.</p>

  <p>"Whew!" I said, staring at van Manderpootz, who had been reading.</p>

  <p>"You liked it?"</p>

  <p>"Liked it! Say, I guess I was lucky to be cleaned out. I won't regret it
  from now on."</p>

  <p>"That," said the professor grandly, "is van Manderpootz's great
  contribution to human happiness. 'Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the
  saddest are these: It might have been!' True no longer, my friend Dick. Van
  Manderpootz has shown that the proper reading is, 'It might have been&mdash;
  worse!'"</p>

  <p>It was very late when I returned home, and as a result, very late when I
  rose, and equally late when I got to the office. My father was unnecessarily
  worked up about it, but he exaggerated when he said I'd never been on time.
  He forgets the occasions when he's awakened me and dragged me down with him.
  Nor was it necessary to refer so sarcastically to my missing the Baikal; I
  reminded him of the wrecking of the liner, and he responded very heartlessly
  that if I'd been aboard, the rocket would have been late, and so would have
  missed colliding with the British fruitship. It was likewise superfluous for
  him to mention that when he and I had tried to snatch a few weeks of golfing
  in the mountains, even the spring had been late. I had nothing to do with
  that.</p>

  <p>"Dixon," he concluded, "you have no conception whatever of time. None
  whatever."</p>

  <p>The conversation with van Manderpootz recurred to me. I was impelled to
  ask, "And have you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I have," he said grimly. "I most assuredly have. Time," he said
  oracularly "is money."</p>

  <p>You can't argue with a viewpoint like that.</p>

  <p>But those aspersions of his rankled, especially that about the Baikal.
  Tardy I might be, but it was hardly conceivable that my presence aboard the
  rocket could have averted the catastrophe. It irritated me; in a way, it made
  me responsible for the deaths of those unrescued hundreds among the
  passengers and crew, and I didn't like the thought.</p>

  <p>Of course, if they'd waited an extra five minutes for me, or if I'd been
  on time and they'd left on schedule instead of five minutes late, or if
  &mdash;if!</p>

  <p>If! The word called up van Manderpootz and his subjunctivisor&mdash;the
  worlds of "if," the weird, unreal worlds that existed beside reality, neither
  past nor future, but contemporary, yet extemporal. Somewhere among their
  ghostly infinities existed one that represented the world that would have
  been had I made the liner. I had only to call up Haskel van Manderpootz, make
  an appointment, and then&mdash;find out.</p>

  <p>Yet it wasn't an easy decision. Suppose&mdash;just suppose that I found
  myself responsible&mdash;not legally responsible, certainly; there'd be no
  question of criminal negligence, or anything of that sort&mdash;not even
  morally responsible, because I couldn't possibly have anticipated that my
  presence or absence could weigh so heavily in the scales of life and death,
  nor could I have known in which direction the scales would tip. Just&mdash;
  responsible; that was all. Yet I hated to find out.</p>

  <p>I hated equally not finding out. Uncertainty has its pangs too, quite as
  painful as those of remorse. It might be less nerve-racking to know myself
  responsible than to wonder, to waste thoughts in vain doubts and futile
  reproaches. So I seized the visiphone, dialed the number of the University
  and at length gazed on the broad, humorous, intelligent features of van
  Manderpootz, dragged from a morning lecture by my call.</p>

  <p>I was all but prompt for the appointment the following evening, and might
  actually have been on time but for an unreasonable traffic officer who
  insisted on booking me for speeding. At any rate, van Manderpootz was
  impressed.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he rumbled. "I almost missed you, Dixon. I was just going over to
  the club, since I didn't expect you for an hour. You're only ten minutes
  late."</p>

  <p>I ignored this. "Professor, I want to use your&mdash;uh&mdash;your
  subjunctivisor."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Oh, yes. You're lucky, then. I was just about to dismantle it."</p>

  <p>"Dismantle it! Why?"</p>

  <p>"It has served its purpose. It has given birth to an idea far more
  important than itself. I shall need the space it occupies."</p>

  <p>"But what is the idea, if it's not too presumptuous of me to ask?"</p>

  <p>"It is not too presumptuous. You and the world which awaits it so eagerly
  may both know, but you bear it from the lips of the author. It is nothing
  less than the autobiography of van Manderpootz!" He paused impressively.</p>

  <p>I gaped. "Your autobiography?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The world, though perhaps unaware, is crying for it. I shall detail
  my life, my work. I shall reveal myself as the man responsible for the three
  years' duration of the Pacific War of 2004."</p>

  <p>"None other. Had I not been a loyal Netherlands subject at that time, and
  therefore neutral, the forces of Asia would have been crushed in three months
  instead of three years. The subjunctivisor tells me so; I would have invented
  a calculator to forecast the chances of every engagement; van Manderpootz
  would have removed the bit or miss element in the conduct of war." He frowned
  solemnly. "There is my idea. The autobiography of van Manderpootz. What do
  you think of it?"</p>

  <p>I recovered my thoughts. "It's&mdash;uh&mdash;it's colossal!" I said
  vehemently. "I'll buy a copy myself. Several copies. I'll send 'em to my
  friends."</p>

  <p>"I," said van Manderpootz expansively, "shall autograph your copy for you.
  It will be priceless. I shall write in some fitting phrase, perhaps something
  like <i>Magnificus sed non superbus</i>. 'Great but not proud!' That well
  described van Manderpootz, who despite his greatness is simple, modest, and
  unassuming. Don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly! A very apt description of you. But&mdash;couldn't I see your
  subjunctivisor before it's dismantled to make way for the greater work?"</p>

  <p>"Ali! You wish to find out something?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, professor. Do you remember the Baikal disaster of a week or two ago?
  I was to have taken that liner to Moscow. I just missed it." I related the
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he grunted. "You wish to discover what would have happened had
  you caught it, eh? Well, I see several possibilities. Among the world of 'if'
  is the one that would have been real if you had been on time, the one that
  depended on the vessel waiting for your actual arrival, and the one that hung
  on your arriving within the five minutes they actually waited. In which are
  you interested?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;the last one." That seemed the likeliest. After all, it was too
  much to expect that Dixon Wells could ever be on time, and as to the second
  possibility&mdash;well, they hadn't waited for me, and that in a way removed
  the weight of responsibility.</p>

  <p>"Come on," rumbled van Manderpootz. I followed him across to the Physics
  Building and into his littered laboratory. The device still stood on the
  table and I took my place before it, staring at the screen of the Horsten
  psychomat. The clouds wavered and shifted as I sought to impress my memories
  on their suggestive shapes, to read into them some, picture of that vanished
  morning.</p>

  <p>Then I had it. I made out the vista from the Staten Bridge, and was
  speeding across the giant span toward the airport. I waved a signal to van
  Manderpootz, the thing clicked, and the subjunctivisor was on.</p>

  <p>The grassless clay of the field appeared. It is a curious thing about the
  psychomat that you see only through the eyes of your image on the screen. It
  lends a strange reality to the working of the toy; I suppose a sort of self-
  hypnosis is partly responsible.</p>

  <p>I was rushing over the ground toward the glittering, silver-winged
  projectile that was the Baikal. A glowering officer waved me on, and I dashed
  up the slant of the gangplank and into the ship; the port dropped and I heard
  a long "Whew!" of relief.</p>

  <p>"Sit down!" barked the officer, gesturing toward an unoccupied seat. I
  fell into it; the ship quivered under the thrust of the catapult, grated
  harshly into motion, and then was flung bodily into the air. The blasts
  roared instantly, then settled to a more muffled throbbing, and I watched
  Staten Island drop down and slide back beneath me. The giant rocket was under
  way.</p>

  <p>"Whew!" I breathed again. "Made it!" I caught an amused glance from my
  right. I was in an aisle seat; there was no one to my left, so I turned to
  the eyes that had flashed, glanced, and froze staring.</p>

  <p>It was a girl. Perhaps she wasn't actually as lovely as she looked to me;
  after all, I was seeing her through the half-visionary screen of a psychomat.
  I've told myself since that she couldn't have been as pretty as she seemed,
  that it was due to my own imagination filling in the details. I don't know; I
  remember only that I stared at curiously lovely silver-blue eyes and velvety
  brown hair, and a small amused mouth, and an impudent nose. I kept staring
  until she flushed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," I said quickly. "I&mdash;was startled."</p>

  <p>There's a friendly atmosphere aboard a trans-oceanic rocket. The
  passengers are forced into a crowded infirmary for anywhere from seven to
  twelve hours, and there isn't much room for moving about. Generally, one
  strikes up an acquaintance with his neighbors; introductions aren't at all
  necessary, and the custom is simply to speak to anybody you choose&mdash;
  something like an all-day trip on the railroad trains of the last century, I
  suppose. You make friends for the duration of the journey, and then, nine
  times out of ten, you never hear of your traveling companions again.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled. "Are you the individual responsible for the delay in
  starting?"</p>

  <p>I admitted it. "I seem to be chronically late. Even watches lose time as
  soon as I wear them."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Your responsibilities can't be very heavy."</p>

  <p>Well, they weren't of course, though it's surprising how many clubs,
  caddies, and chorus girls have depended on me at various times for
  appreciable portions of their incomes. But somehow I didn't feel like
  mentioning those things to the silvery-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>We talked. Her name, it developed, was Joanna Caldwell, and she was going
  as far as Paris. She was an artist, or hoped to be one day, and of course
  there is no place in the world that can supply both training and inspiration,
  like Paris. So it was there she was bound for a year of study, and despite
  her demurely humorous lips and laughing eyes, I could see that the business
  was of vast importance to her. I gathered that she had worked hard for the
  year in Paris, had scraped and saved for three years as fashion illustrator
  for some woman's magazine, though she couldn't have been many months over
  twenty-one. Her painting meant a great deal to her, and I could understand
  it. I'd felt that way about polo once.</p>

  <p>So you see, we were sympathetic spirits from the beginning. I knew that
  she liked me, and it was obvious that she didn't connect Dixon Wells with the
  N. J. Wells Corporation. And as for me&mdash;well, after that first glance
  into her coot silver eyes, I simply didn't care to look anywhere else. The
  hours seemed to drip away like minutes while I watched her.</p>

  <p>You know how those things go. Suddenly I was calling her Joanna and she
  was calling me Dick, and it seemed as if we'd been doing just that all our
  lives. I'd decided to stop over in Paris on my way back from Moscow, and I'd
  secured her promise to let me see her. She was different, I tell you; she was
  nothing like the calculating Whimsy White, and still less like the dancing,
  simpering, giddy youngsters one meets around at social affairs. She was just
  Joanna, cool and humorous, yet sympathetic and serious, and as pretty as a
  Majolica figurine.</p>

  <p>We could scarcely realize it when the steward passed along to take orders
  for luncheon. Four hours out? It seemed like forty minutes. And we had a
  pleasant feeling of intimacy in the discovery that both of us liked lobster
  salad and detested oysters. It was another bond; I told her whimsically that
  it was an omen, nor did she object to considering it so.</p>

  <p>Afterwards we walked along the narrow aisle to the glassed-in observation
  room up forward. It was almost too crowded for entry, but we didn't mind that
  at all, as it forced us to sit very close together. We stayed long after both
  of us had begun to notice the stuffiness of the air.</p>

  <p>It was just after we had returned to our seats that the catastrophe
  occurred. There was no warning save a sudden lurch, the result, I suppose, of
  the pilot's futile last-minute attempt to swerve&mdash;just that and then a
  grinding crash and a terrible sensation of spinning, and after that a chorus
  of shrieks that were like the sounds of a battle.</p>

  <p>It was battle. Five hundred people were picking themselves up from the
  floor, were trampling each other, milling around, being cast helplessly down
  as the great rocket-plane, its left wing but a broken stub, circled downward
  toward the Atlantic.</p>

  <p>The shouts of officers sounded and a loudspeaker blared. "Be calm," it
  kept repeating, and then, "There has been a collision. We have contacted a
  surface ship. There is no danger&mdash;There is no danger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I struggled up from the debris of shattered seats. Joanna was gone; just
  as I found her crumpled between the rows, the ship struck the water with a
  jar that set everything crashing again. The speaker blared, "Put on the cork
  belts under the seats! The life-belts are under the seats!"</p>

  <p>I dragged a belt loose and snapped it around Joanna, then donned one
  myself. The crowd was surging forward now, and the tail end of the ship began
  to drop. There was water behind us, sloshing in the darkness as the lights
  went out. An officer came sliding by, stooped, and fastened a belt about an
  unconscious woman ahead of us. "You all right?" he yelled, and passed on
  without waiting for an answer.</p>

  <p>The speaker must have been cut on to a battery circuit. "And get as far
  away as possible," it ordered suddenly. "Jump from the forward port and get
  as far away as possible. A ship is standing by. You will be picked up. Jump
  from the&mdash;" It went dead again.</p>

  <p>I got Joanna untangled from the wreckage. She was pale; her silvery eyes
  were closed. I started dragging her slowly and painfully toward the forward
  port, and the slant of the floor increased until it was like the slide of a
  ski-jump. The officer passed again. "Can you handle her?" he asked, and again
  dashed away.</p>

  <p>I was getting there. The crowd around the port looked smaller, or was it
  simply huddling closer? Then suddenly, a wail of fear and despair went up,
  and there was a roar of water. The observation room walls had given. I saw
  the green surge of waves, and a billowing deluge rushed down upon us. I had
  been late again.</p>

  <p>That was all. I raised shocked and frightened eyes from the subjunctivisor
  to face van Manderpootz, who was scribbling on the edge of the table.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I shuddered. "Horrible!" I murmured. "We&mdash;I guess we wouldn't have
  been among the survivors."</p>

  <p>"We, eh? We?" His eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>I did not enlighten him.</p>

  <p>I thanked him, bade him good-night and went dolorously home.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Even my father noticed something queer about me. The day I
got to the
  office only five minutes late, he called me in for some anxious questioning
  as to my health. I couldn't tell him anything, of course. How could I explain
  that I'd been late once too often, and had fallen in love with a girl two
  weeks after she was dead?</p>

  <p>The thought drove me nearly crazy. Joanna! Joanna with her silvery eyes
  now lay somewhere at the bottom of the Atlantic. I went around half dazed,
  scarcely speaking. One night I actually lacked the energy to go home and sat
  smoking in my father's big overstuffed chair in his private office until I
  finally dozed off. The next morning, when old N. J. entered and found me
  there before him, he turned pale as paper, staggered, and gasped, "My heart!"
  It took a lot of explaining to convince him that I wasn't early at the office
  but just very late going home.</p>

  <p>At last I felt that I couldn't stand it. I had to do something&mdash;
  anything at all. I thought finally of the subjunctivisor. I could see&mdash;
  yes, I could see what would have transpired if the ship hadn't been wrecked!
  I could trace out that weird, unreal romance hidden somewhere in the worlds
  of "if." I could, perhaps, wring a somber, vicarious joy from the things that
  might have been. I could see Joanna once more!</p>

  <p>It was late afternoon when I rushed over to van Manderpootz's quarters. He
  wasn't there; I encountered him finally in the hall of the Physics
  Building.</p>

  <p>"Dick!" he exclaimed. "Are you sick?"</p>

  <p>"Sick? No, not physically. Professor, I've got to use your subjunctivisor
  again. I've got to!"</p>

  <p>"Eh? Oh&mdash;that toy. You're too late, Dick. I've dismantled it. I have
  a better use for the space."</p>

  <p>I gave a miserable groan and was tempted to damn the autobiography of the
  great van Manderpootz. A gleam of sympathy showed in his eyes, and he took my
  arm, dragging me into the little office adjoining his laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he commanded.</p>

  <p>I did. I guess I made the tragedy plain enough, for his heavy brows knit
  in a frown of pity. "Not even van Manderpootz can bring back the dead," he
  murmured. "I'm sorry, Dick. Take your mind from the affair. Even were my
  subjunctivisor available, I wouldn't permit you to use it. That would be but
  to turn the knife in the wound." He paused. "Find something else to occupy
  your mind. Do as van Manderpootz does. Find forgetfulness in work."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I responded dully. "But who'd want to read my autobiography? That's
  all right for you."</p>

  <p>"Autobiography? Oh! I remember. No, I have abandoned that. History itself
  will record the life and works of van Manderpootz. Now I am engaged in a far
  grander project."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" I was utterly, gloomily disinterested.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Gogli has been here, Gogli the sculptor. He is to make a bust of me.
  What better legacy can I leave to the world than a bust of van Manderpootz,
  sculptured from life? Perhaps I shall present it to the city, perhaps to the
  university. I would have given it to the Royal Society if they had been a
  little more receptive, if they&mdash;if&mdash;if!" The last in a shout.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>"If!" cried van Manderpootz. "What you saw in the subjunctivisor was what
  would have happened if you had caught the ship!"</p>

  <p>"I know that."</p>

  <p>"But something quite different might really have happened! Don't you see?
  She&mdash;she&mdash;Where are those old newspapers?"</p>

  <p>He was pawing through a pile of them. He flourished one finally. "Here!
  Here are the survivors!"</p>

  <p>Like letters of flame, Joanna Caldwell's name leaped out at me. There was
  even a little paragraph about it, as I saw once my reeling brain permitted me
  to read:</p>

  <p>At least a score of survivors owe their lives to the bravery of twenty-
  eight-year-old Navigator Orris Hope, who patrolled both aisles during the
  panic, lacing lifebelts on the injured and helpless, and carrying many to the
  port. He remained on the sinking liner until the last, finally fighting his
  way to the surface through the broken walls of the observation room. Among
  those who owe their lives to the young officer are: Patrick Owensby. New York
  City; Mrs. Campbell Warren, Boston; Miss Joanna Caldwell, New York
  City&mdash;</p>

  <p>I suppose my shout of joy was heard over in the Administration Building,
  blocks away. I didn't care; if van Manderpootz hadn't been armored in stubby
  whiskers, I'd have kissed him. Perhaps I did anyway; I can't be sure of my
  actions during those chaotic minutes in the professor's tiny office.</p>

  <p>At last I calmed. "I can look her up!" I gloated. "She must have landed
  with the other survivors, and they were all on that British tramp freighter
  the Osgood, that docked here last week. She must be in New York&mdash;and if
  she's gone over to Paris, I'll find out and follow her!"</p>

  <p>Well, it's a queer ending. She was in New York, but&mdash;you see, Dixon
  Wells had, so to speak, known Joanna Caldwell by means of the professor's
  subjunctivisor, but Joanna had never known Dixon Wells. What the ending might
  have been if&mdash;if&mdash;But it wasn't; she had married Orris Hope, the
  young officer who had rescued her. I was late again.</p>
