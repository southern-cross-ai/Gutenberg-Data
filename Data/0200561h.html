<h1>MARK TWAIN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>

<h3>With an introduction by Albert Bigelow Paine</h3>

<h4>1924</h4>

<h3>First Edition</h3>

<h2>VOLUME 2</h2>

<p><i>New York, Tuesday, January 23, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>About a meeting at Carnegie Hall, in the interest of Booker
Washington's Tuskegee Institute.--An unpleasant political
incident which happened to Mr. Twichell.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There was a great mass meeting at Carnegie Hall last night, in
the interest of Booker Washington's Tuskegee Educational
Institute in the South, and the interest which New York people
feel in that Institute was quite manifest, in the fact that
although it was not pleasant weather there were three thousand
people inside the Hall and two thousand outside, who were trying
to get in when the performances were ready to begin at eight
o'clock.<sup>1</sup> Mr. Choate presided, and was received with a
grand welcome when he marched in upon the stage. He is fresh from
his long stay in England, as our Ambassador, where he won the
English people by the gifts of his heart, and won the royalties
and the Government by his able diplomatic service, and captured
the whole nation with his fine and finished oratory. For
thirty-five years Choate has been the handsomest man in America.
Last night he seemed to me to be just as handsome as he was
thirty-five years ago, when I first knew him. And when I used to
see him in England, five or six years ago, I thought him the
handsomest man in that country.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> They were largely attracted by the
announcement that Mark Twain was to be present and would
speak.--A. B. P.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was at a Fourth of July reception in Mr. Choate's house in
London that I first met Booker Washington. I have met him a
number of times since, and he always impresses me pleasantly.
Last night he was a mulatto. I didn't notice it until he turned,
while he was speaking, and said something to me. It was a great
surprise to me to see that he was a mulatto and had blue eyes.
How unobservant a dull person can be! Always, before, he was
black, to me, and I had never noticed whether he had eyes at all,
or not. He has accomplished a wonderful work in this quarter of a
century. When he finished his education at the Hampton Colored
School twenty-five years ago he was unknown and hadn't a penny,
nor a friend outside his immediate acquaintanceship. But by the
persuasions of his carriage and address and the sincerity and
honesty that look out of his eyes he has been enabled to gather
money by the hatful here in the North, and with it he has built
up and firmly established his great school for the colored people
of the two sexes in the South. In that school the students are
not merely furnished a book education, but are taught
thirty-seven useful trades. Booker Washington has scraped
together many hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the
twenty-five years, and with this money he has taught and sent
forth into Southern fields among the colored people six thousand
trained colored men and women; and his student roll now numbers
fifteen hundred names. The Institute's property is worth a
million and a half, and the establishment is in a flourishing
condition. A most remarkable man is Booker Washington. And he is
a fervent and effective speaker on the platform.</p>

<p>When the affair was over and the people began to climb up on
the stage and pass along and shake hands, the usual thing
happened. It always happens. I shake hands with people who used
to know my mother intimately in Arkansas, in New Jersey, in
California, in Jericho--and I have to seem so glad and so happy
to meet these persons who knew in this intimate way one who was
so near and dear to me. And this is the kind of thing that
gradually turns a person into a polite liar and deceiver, for my
mother was never in any of those places.</p>

<p>One pretty creature was glad to see me again, and remembered
being at my house in Hartford--I don't know when, a great many
years ago, it was. Now she was mistaking herself for somebody
else. It <i>couldn't</i> have happened to her. But I was very
cordial, because she <i>was</i> very pretty. We might have had a
good long chat except for the others that I had to talk with and
work up reminiscences that belonged in somebody else's
experiences, not theirs or mine.</p>

<p>There was one young fellow, brisk, but not bright,
overpoweringly pleasant and cordial, in his way. He said his
mother used to teach school in Elmira, New York, where he was
born and bred and where the family continued to reside, and that
she would be very glad to know that he had met me and shaken
hands, for he said: "She is always talking about you. She holds
you in high esteem, although, as she says, she has to confess
that of all the boys that ever she had in her school, you were
the most troublesome."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "those were my last school days, and through
long practice in being troublesome, I had reached the summit by
that time, because I was more than thirty-three years old."</p>

<p>It didn't affect him in the least. I don't think he even heard
what I said, he was so eager to tell me all about it, and I said
to him once more, so as to spare him, and me, that I was never in
a schoolhouse in Elmira, New York, even on a visit, and that his
mother must be mistaking <i>me</i> for some of the Langdons, the
family into which I married. No matter, he didn't hear it--kept
on his talk with animation and delight, and has gone to tell his
mother, I don't know what. He didn't get anything out of me to
tell her, for he never heard anything I said.</p>

<p>These episodes used to vex me, years and years ago. But they
don't vex me now. I am older. If a person thinks that he has
known me at some time or other, all I require of him is that he
shall consider it a distinction to have known me; and then, as a
rule, I am perfectly willing to remember all about it and add
some things that he has forgotten.</p>

<p>Twichell came down from Hartford to be present at that
meeting, and we chatted and smoked after we got back home. And
reference was made again to that disastrous Boston speech which I
made at Whittier's seventieth-birthday dinner; and Joe asked me
if I was still minded to submit that speech to that club in
Washington, day after to-morrow, where Colonel Harvey and I are
to be a couple of the four guests. And I said, "No," I had given
that up--which was true. Because I have examined that speech a
couple of times since, and have changed my notion about
it--changed it entirely. I find it gross, coarse--well, I needn't
go on with particulars. I didn't like any part of it, from the
beginning to the end. I found it always offensive and detestable.
How do I account for this change of view? I don't know. I can't
account for it. I am the person concerned. If I could put myself
outside of myself and examine it from the point of view of a
person not personally concerned in it, then no doubt I could
analyze it and explain to my satisfaction the change which has
taken place. As it is, I am merely moved by instinct. My instinct
said, formerly, that it was an innocent speech, and funny. The
same instinct, sitting cold and judicial, as a court of last
resort, has reversed that verdict. I expect this latest verdict
to remain.</p>

<p>Twichell's congregation--the only congregation he has ever had
since he entered the ministry--celebrated the fortieth
anniversary of his accession to that pulpit, a couple of weeks
ago. Joe entered the army as chaplain in the very beginning of
the Civil War. He was a young chap, and had just been graduated
from Yale and the Yale Theological Seminary. He made all the
campaigns of the Army of the Potomac. When he was mustered out,
that congregation I am speaking of called him, and he has served
them ever since, and always to their satisfaction--except
once.</p>

<p>I have found among my old MSS. one which I perceive to be
about twenty-two years old. It has a heading and looks as if I
had meant it to serve as a magazine article. I can clearly see,
now, why I didn't print it. It is full of indications that its
inspiration was what happened to Twichell about that time, and
which produced a situation for him which he will not forget until
he is dead, if he even forgets it then. I think I can see, all
through this artful article, that I was trying to hint at
Twichell, and the episode of that preacher whom I met on the
street, and hint at various things that were exasperating me. And
now that I read that old article, I perceive that I probably saw
that my art was not ingenious enough---that I hadn't covered
Twichell up, and hadn't covered up the episode that I was hinting
at--that anybody in Hartford could read everything between the
lines that I was trying to conceal.</p>

<p>I will insert this venerable article in this place, and then
take up that episode in Joe's history and tell about it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>THE CHARACTER OF MAN</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Concerning Man--he is too large a subject to be treated as a
whole; so I will merely discuss a detail or two of him at this
time. I desire to contemplate him from this point of view--this
premise: that he was not made for any useful purpose, for the
reason that he hasn't served any; that he was most likely not
even made <i>intentionally</i>; and that his working himself up
out of the oyster bed to his present position was probably matter
of surprise and regret to the Creator. . . . For his history, in
all climes, all ages and all circumstances, furnishes oceans and
continents of proof that of all the creatures that were made he
is the most detestable. Of the entire brood he is the only
one--the solitary one--that possesses malice.</p>

<p>That is the basest of all instincts, passions, vices--the most
hateful. That one thing puts him below the rats, the grubs, the
trichinae. He is the only creature that inflicts pain for sport,
knowing it to <i>be</i> pain. But if the cat knows she is
inflicting pain when she plays with the frightened mouse, then we
must make an exception here; we must grant that in one detail man
is the moral peer of the cat. <i>All</i> creatures kill--there
seems to be no exception; but of the whole list, man is the only
one that kills for fun; he is the only one that kills in malice,
the only one that kills for revenge. Also--in all the list he is
the only creature that has a nasty mind.</p>

<p>Shall he be extolled for his noble qualities, for his
gentleness, his sweetness, his amiability, his lovingness, his
courage, his devotion, his patience, his fortitude, his prudence,
the various charms and graces of his spirit? The other animals
share <i>all</i> these with him, yet are free from the
blacknesses and rottennesses of his character.</p>

<p>. . . There are certain sweet-smelling sugar-coated lies
current in the world which all politic men have apparently
tacitly conspired together to support and perpetuate. One of
these is, that there is such a thing in the world as
independence: independence of thought, independence of opinion,
independence of action. Another is, that the world loves to
<i>see</i> independence--admires it, applauds it. Another is,
that there is such a thing in the world as toleration--in
religion, in politics, and such matters; and with it trains that
already mentioned auxiliary lie that toleration is admired and
applauded. Out of these trunk-lies spring many branch ones: to
wit, the lie that not all men are slaves: the lie that men are
glad when other men succeed; glad when they prosper; glad to see
them reach lofty heights; sorry to see them fall again. And yet
other branch lies: to wit, that there is heroism in man; that he
is not mainly made up of malice and treachery; that he is
sometimes not a coward; that there is something about him that
ought to be perpetuated--in heaven, or hell, or somewhere. And
these other branch lies, to wit: that conscience, man's moral
medicine chest, is not only created by the Creator, but is put
into man ready charged with the right and only true and authentic
correctives of conduct--and the duplicate chest, with the
self-same correctives, unchanged, unmodified, distributed to all
nations and all epochs. And yet one other branch lie: to wit,
that I am I, and you are you; that we are units, individuals, and
have natures of our own, instead of being the tail end of a
tapeworm eternity of ancestors extending in linked procession
back and back and back--to our source in the monkeys, with this
so-called individuality of ours a decayed and rancid mush of
inherited instincts and teachings derived, atom by atom, stench
by stench, from the entire line of that sorry column, and not so
much new and original matter in it as you could balance on a
needle point and examine under a microscope. This makes well-nigh
fantastic the suggestion that there can be such a thing as a
personal, original, and responsible nature in a man, separable
from that in him which is not original, and findable in such
quantity as to enable the observer to say, This is a man, not a
procession.</p>

<p>. . . Consider the first-mentioned lie: that there is such a
thing in the world as independence; that it exists in
individuals; that it exists in bodies of men. Surely if anything
<i>is</i> proven, by whole oceans and continents of evidence, it
is that the quality of independence was almost wholly left out of
the human race. The scattering exceptions to the rule only
emphasize it, light it up, make it glare. The whole population of
New England meekly took their turns, for years, in standing up in
the railway trains, without so much as a complaint above their
breath, till at last these uncounted millions were able to
produce exactly one single independent man, who stood to his
rights and made the railroad give him a seat. Statistics and the
law of probabilities warrant the assumption that it will take New
England forty years to breed his fellow. There is a law, with a
penalty attached, forbidding trains to occupy the Asylum Street
crossing more than five minutes at a time. For years people and
carriages used to wait there nightly as much as twenty minutes on
a stretch while New England trains monopolized that crossing. I
used to hear men use vigorous language about that insolent
wrong--but they waited, just the same.</p>

<p>We are discreet sheep; we wait to see how the drove is going,
and then go with the drove. We have two opinions: one private,
which we are afraid to express; and another one--the one we
use--which we force ourselves to wear to please Mrs. Grundy,
until habit makes us comfortable in it, and the custom of
defending it presently makes us love it, adore it, and forget how
pitifully we came by it. Look at it in politics. Look at the
candidates whom we loathe, one year, and are afraid to vote
against, the next; whom we cover with unimaginable filth, one
year, and fall down on the public platform and worship, the
next--and keep on doing it until the habitual shutting of our
eyes to last year's evidences brings us presently to a sincere
and stupid belief in this year's. Look at the tyranny of
party--at what is called party allegiance, party loyalty--a snare
invented by designing men for selfish purposes--and which turns
voters into chattels, slaves, rabbits, and all the while their
masters, and they themselves are shouting rubbish about liberty,
independence, freedom of opinion, freedom of speech, honestly
unconscious of the fantastic contradiction; and forgetting or
ignoring that their fathers and the churches shouted the same
blasphemies a generation earlier when they were closing their
doors against the hunted slave, beating his handful of humane
defenders with Bible texts and billies, and pocketing the insults
and licking the shoes of his Southern master.</p>

<p>If we would learn what the human race really <i>is</i> at
bottom, we need only observe it in election times. A Hartford
clergyman met me in the street and spoke of a new
nominee--denounced the nomination, in strong, earnest
words--words that were refreshing for their independence, their
manliness.<sup>1</sup> He said, "I ought to be proud, perhaps,
for this nominee is a relative of mine; on the contrary, I am
humiliated and disgusted, for I know him
intimately--familiarly--and I know that he is an unscrupulous
scoundrel, and always has been." You should have seen this
clergyman preside at a political meeting forty days later, and
urge, and plead, and gush--and you should have heard him paint
the character of this same nominee. You would have supposed he
was describing the Cid, and Greatheart, and Sir Galahad, and
Bayard the Spotless all rolled into one. Was he sincere? Yes--by
that time; and therein lies the pathos of it all, the
hopelessness of it all. It shows at what trivial cost of effort a
man can teach himself to lie, and learn to believe it, when he
perceives, by the general drift, that that is the popular thing
to do. Does he believe his lie <i>yet</i><i>?</i> Oh, probably
not; he has no further use for it. It was but a passing incident;
he spared to it the moment that was its due, then hastened back
to the serious business of his life.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> <i>Jan, 11, '06.</i>--I can't remember his
name. It began with K, I think. He was one of the American
revisers of the New Testament, and was nearly as great a scholar
as Hammond Trumbull.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>And what a paltry poor lie is that one which teaches that
independence of action and opinion is prized in men, admired,
honored, rewarded. When a man leaves a political party, he is
treated as if the party owned him--as if he were its bond slave,
as most party men plainly are--and had stolen himself, gone off
with what was not his own. And he is traduced, derided, despised,
held up to public obloquy and loathing. His character is
remorselessly assassinated; no means, however vile, are spared to
injure his property and his business.</p>

<p>The preacher who casts a vote for conscience' sake runs the
risk of starving. And is rightly served, for he has been teaching
a falsity--that men respect and honor independence of thought and
action.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher may be charged with a <i>crime</i><i>,</i> and his
whole following will rise as one man, and stand by him to the
bitter end; but who so poor to be his friend when he is charged
with casting a vote for conscience' sake? Take the editor so
charged--take--take anybody.</p>

<p>All the talk about tolerance, in anything or anywhere, is
plainly a gentle lie. It does not exist. It is in no man's heart;
but it unconsciously, and by moss-grown inherited habit, drivels
and slobbers from all men's lips. Intolerance is everything for
oneself, and nothing for the other person. The mainspring of
man's nature is just that--selfishness. Let us skip the other
lies, for brevity's sake. To consider them would prove nothing,
except that man is what he is--loving toward his own, lovable to
his own--his family, his friends--and otherwise the buzzing,
busy, trivial enemy of his race--who tarries his little day, does
his little dirt, commends himself to God, and then goes out into
the darkness, to return no more, and send no messages
back--selfish even in death.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>New York, Wednesday, January 24, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Tells of the defeat of Mr. Blaine for the Presidency, and
how Mr. Clemens's, Mr. Twichell's, and Mr. Goodwin's votes were
cast for Cleveland.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is plain, I think, that this old article was written about
twenty-two years ago, and that it followed by about three or four
months the defeat of James G. Blaine for the Presidency and the
election of Grover Cleveland, the Democratic candidate--a
temporary relief from a Republican-party domination which had
lasted a generation. I had been accustomed to vote for
Republicans more frequently than for Democrats, but I was never a
Republican and never a Democrat. In the community, I was regarded
as a Republican, but I had never so regarded myself. As early as
1865 or '66 I had had this curious experience: that whereas up to
that time I had considered myself a Republican, I was converted
to a no-party independence by the wisdom of a rabid Republican.
This was a man who was afterward a United States Senator, and
upon whose character rests no blemish that <i>I</i> know of,
except that he was the father of the William R. Hearst of to-day,
and therefore grandfather of Yellow Journalism--that calamity of
calamities.</p>

<p>Hearst was a Missourian; I was a Missourian. He was a long,
lean, practical, common-sense, uneducated man of fifty or
thereabouts. I was shorter and better informed--at least I
thought so. One day, in the Lick House in San Francisco, he
said:</p>

<p>"I am a Republican; I expect to remain a Republican always. It
is my purpose, and I am not a changeable person. But look at the
condition of things. The Republican party goes right along, from
year to year, scoring triumph after triumph, until it has come to
think that the political power of the United States is its
property and that it is a sort of insolence for any other party
to aspire to any part of that power. Nothing can be worse for a
country than this. To lodge all power in one party and keep it
there is to insure bad government and <i>the sure and gradual
deterioration of the public morals</i><i>.</i> The parties ought
to be so nearly equal in strength as to make it necessary for the
leaders on both sides to choose the very best men they can find.
Democratic fathers ought to divide up their sons between the two
parties if they can, and do their best in this way to equalize
the powers. I have only one son. He is a little boy, but I am
already instructing him, persuading him, preparing him, to vote
against me when he comes of age, let me be on whichever side I
may. He is already a good Democrat, and I want him to remain a
good Democrat--until I become a Democrat myself. Then I shall
shift him to the other party, if I can."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that this unlettered man was at least a wise
one. And I have never voted a straight ticket from that day to
this. I have never belonged to any party from that day to this. I
have never belonged to any church from that day to this. I have
remained absolutely free in those matters. And in this
independence I have found a spiritual comfort and a peace of mind
quite above price.</p>

<p>When Blaine came to be talked of by the Republican leaders as
their probable candidate for the Presidency, the Republicans of
Hartford were very sorry, and they thought they foresaw his
defeat, in case he should be nominated. But they stood in no
great fear of his nomination. The convention met in Chicago and
the balloting began. In my house we were playing billiards. Sam
Dunham was present; also F. G. Whitmore, Henry C. Robinson,
Charles E. Perkins, and Edward M. Bunce. We took turns in the
game, and, meanwhile, discussed the political situation. George,
the colored butler, was down in the kitchen on guard at the
telephone. As fast as a ballot was received at the political
headquarters downtown, it was telephoned out to the house, and
George reported it to us through the speaking-tube. Nobody
present was seriously expecting the nomination of Mr. Blaine. All
these men were Republicans, but they had no affection for Blaine.
For two years the Hartford <i>Courant</i> had been holding Blaine
up to scorn and contumely. It had been denouncing him daily. It
had been mercilessly criticizing his political conduct and
backing up the criticisms with the deadly facts. Up to that time
the <i>Courant</i> had been a paper which could be depended on to
speak its sincere mind about the prominent men of both parties,
and its judgments could be depended upon as being well and
candidly considered, and sound. It had been my custom to pin my
faith to the <i>Courant</i> and accept its verdicts at par.</p>

<p>The billiard game and the discussion went on and on, and by
and by, about mid-afternoon, George furnished us a paralyzing
surprise through the speaking-tube. Mr. Blaine was the nominee!
The butts of the billiard cues came down on the floor with a
bump, and for a while the players were dumb. They could think of
nothing to say. Then Henry Robinson broke the silence. He said,
sorrowfully, that it was hard luck to have to vote for that man.
I said:</p>

<p>"But we <i>don't</i> have to vote for him."</p>

<p>Robinson said, "Do you mean to say that you are not going to
vote for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "that is what I mean to say. I am not going to
vote for him."</p>

<p>The others began to find their voices. They sang the same
note. They said that when a party's representatives choose a man,
that ends it. If they choose unwisely it is a misfortune, but no
loyal member of the party has any right to withhold his vote. He
has a plain duty before him and he can't shirk it. He must vote
for that nominee.</p>

<p>I said that no party held the privilege of dictating to me how
I should vote. That if party loyalty was a form of patriotism, I
was no patriot, and that I didn't think I was much of a patriot,
anyway, for oftener than otherwise what the general body of
Americans regarded as the patriotic course was not in accordance
with my views; that if there was any valuable difference between
being an American and a monarchist it lay in the theory that the
American could decide for himself what is patriotic and what
isn't; whereas the king could dictate the monarchist's patriotism
for him--a decision which was final and must be accepted by the
victim; that in my belief I was the only person in the sixty
millions--with Congress and the Administration back of the sixty
millions--who was privileged to construct my patriotism for
me.</p>

<p>They said, "Suppose the country is entering upon a war--where
do you stand then? Do you arrogate to yourself the privilege of
going your own way in the matter, in the face of the nation?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "that is my position. If I thought it an
unrighteous war I would say so. If I were invited to shoulder a
musket in that cause and march under that flag, I should decline.
I would not voluntarily march under this country's flag, or any
other, when it was my private judgment that the country was in
the wrong. If the country <i>obliged</i> me to shoulder the
musket, I could not help myself, but I would never volunteer. To
volunteer would be the act of a traitor to myself, and
consequently traitor to my country. If I refused to volunteer, I
should be <i>called</i> a traitor, I am well aware of that--but
that would not make me a traitor. The unanimous vote of the sixty
millions could not make me a traitor. I should still be a
patriot, and, in my opinion, the only one in the whole
country."</p>

<p>There was a good deal of talk, but I made no converts. They
were all candid enough to say that they did not want to vote for
Mr. Blaine, but they all said they would <i>do</i> it,
nevertheless. Then Henry Robinson said:</p>

<p>"It is a good while yet before election. There is time for you
to come around, and you will come around. The influences about
you will be too strong for you. On election day you will vote for
Blaine."</p>

<p>I said I should not go to the polls at all.</p>

<p>The <i>Courant</i> had an uncomfortable time thence until
midnight. General Hawley, the editor-in-chief (and he was also
commander-in-chief of the paper), was at his post in Congress,
and the telegraphing to and fro between the <i>Courant</i> and
him went on diligently until midnight. For two years the
<i>Courant</i> had been making a "tar baby" of Mr. Blaine, and
adding tar every day--and now it was called upon to praise him,
hurrah for him, and urge its well-instructed clientele to elevate
the "tar baby" to the Chief Magistracy of the nation. It was a
difficult position and it took the <i>Courant</i> people and
General Hawley nine hours to swallow the bitter pill. But at last
General Hawley reached a decision and at midnight the pill was
swallowed. Within a fortnight the <i>Courant</i> had acquired
some facility in praising where it had so long censured; within
another month the change in its character was become
complete--and to this day it has never recovered its virtue
entirely, though under Charles Hopkins Clark's editorship it has
gotten back 90 per cent of it, by my estimate.</p>

<p>Charles Dudley Warner was the active editor of the time. He
could not stomach the new conditions. He found himself unable to
turn his pen in the other direction and make it proceed backward,
therefore he decided to retire his pen altogether. He withdrew
from the editorship, resigned his salary, lived thenceforth upon
his income as a part proprietor of the paper and upon the
proceeds of magazine work and lecturing, and kept his vote in his
pocket on election day.</p>

<p>The conversation with the learned American member of the board
of scholars which revised the New Testament did occur as I have
outlined it in that old article. He was vehement in his
denunciation of Blaine, his relative, and said he should never
vote for him. But he was so used to revising New Testaments that
it took him only a few days to revise this one. I had hardly
finished with <i>him</i> when I came across James G. Batterson.
Batterson was president of the great Travelers' Insurance
Company. He was a fine man, a strong man, and a valuable citizen.
He was fully as vehement as that clergyman had been in his
denunciations of Blaine--but inside of two weeks he was presiding
at a great Republican ratification meeting; and to hear him talk
about Blaine and his perfections, a stranger would have supposed
that the Republican party had had the good fortune to secure an
archangel as its nominee.</p>

<p>Time went on. Election day was close at hand. Late one frosty
night, Twichell, the Rev. Francis Goodwin, and I were tramping
homeward through the deserted streets in the face of a wintry
gale, after a s&eacute;ance of our Monday Evening Club, and after
a supper-table debate over the political situation, in which the
fact had come out--to the astonishment and indignation of
everybody, the ladies included--that three traitors were present.
That Goodwin, Twichell, and I were going to keep our votes in our
pockets instead of casting them for the archangel. Along in that
homeward tramp, somewhere, Goodwin had a happy idea, and brought
it out. He said:</p>

<p>"Why are we keeping back these three votes from Blaine?
Plainly the answer is, to do what we can to defeat Blaine. Very
well, then, these are three votes against Blaine. The
common-sense procedure would be to cast six votes against him by
turning in our three votes for Cleveland."</p>

<p>Even Twichell and I could see that there was sense in that,
and we said:</p>

<p>"That is a very good thing to do and we'll do it."</p>

<p>On election day we went to the polls and consummated our
hellish design. At that time the voting was public. Any spectator
could see how a man was voting--and straightway this crime was
known to the whole community. This double crime--in the eyes of
the community. To withhold a vote from Blaine was bad enough, but
to add to that iniquity by actually voting for the Democratic
candidate was criminal to a degree for which there was no
adequate language discoverable in the dictionary.</p>

<p>From that day forth, for a good while to come, Twichell's life
was a good deal of a burden to him. To use a common expression,
his congregation "soured" on him and he found small pleasure in
the exercise of his clerical office--unless, perhaps, he got some
healing for his hurts, now and then, through the privilege of
burying some of those people of his. It would have been a
benevolence to bury the whole of them, I think, and a profit to
the community. But if that was Twichell's feeling about it, he
was too charitable in his nature and too kindly to expose it. He
never said it to me, and I think that if he would have said it to
anyone, I should have been the one.</p>

<p>Twichell had most seriously damaged himself with his
congregation. He had a young family to support. It was a large
family already, and it was growing. It was becoming a heavier and
heavier burden every year--but his salary remained always the
same. It became less and less competent to keep up with the
domestic drain upon it, and if there had ever been any prospect
of increasing this salary, that prospect was gone now. It was not
much of a salary. It was four thousand dollars. He had not asked
for more, and it had not occurred to the congregation to offer
it. Therefore his vote for Cleveland was a distinct disaster to
him. That exercise of his ostensible great American privilege of
being free and independent in his political opinions and actions
proved a heavy calamity. But the Rev. Francis Goodwin continued
to be respected as before--that is, publicly; privately he was
damned. But publicly he had suffered no harm. Perhaps it was
because the public approval was not a necessity in his case. His
father was worth seven millions, and was old. The Rev. Francis
was in the line of promotion and would soon inherit.</p>

<p>As far as I was myself concerned, I did not need to worry. I
did not draw my living from Hartford. It was quite sufficient for
my needs. Hartford's opinion of me could not affect it, and
besides it had long been known among my friends that I had never
voted a straight ticket, and was therefore so accustomed to crime
that it was unlikely that disapproval of my conduct could reform
me--and maybe I wasn't worth the trouble, anyway.</p>

<p>By and by, about a couple of months later, New-Year's Eve
arrived, and with it the annual meeting of Joe's congregation and
the annual sale of the pews.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>New York, Thursday, February 1, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Subject of January 24th continued.--Mr. Twichell's
unpopular vote.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Joe was not quite present. It was not etiquette for him to be
within hearing of the business talks concerning the church's
affairs. He remained in the seclusion of the church parlor, ready
to be consulted if that should be necessary. The congregation was
present in full force; every seat was occupied. The moment the
house was called to order, a member sprang to his feet and moved
that the connection between Twichell and the church be dissolved.
The motion was promptly seconded. Here, and there, and yonder,
all over the house, there were calls of, "Question! Question!"
But Mr. Hubbard, a middle-aged man, a wise and calm and collected
man, business manager and part owner of the <i>Courant,</i> rose
in his place and proposed to discuss the motion before rushing it
to a vote. The substance of his remarks was this (which I must
put in my own language, of course, as I was not there):</p>

<p>"Mr. Twichell was the first pastor you have ever had. You have
never wanted another until two months ago. You have had no fault
to find with his ministrations as your pastor, but he has
suddenly become unfit to continue them because he is unorthodox
in his politics, according to your views. Very well, he
<i>was</i> fit; he has become unfit. He <i>was</i> valuable; his
value has passed away, apparently--but only apparently. His
highest value remains--if I know this congregation. When he
assumed this pastorate this region was an outlying district,
thinly inhabited, its real estate worth next to nothing. Mr.
Twichell's personality was a magnet which immediately began to
draw population in this direction. It has continued to draw it
from that day to this. As a result, your real estate, almost
valueless in the beginning, ranges now at very high prices.
Reflect before you vote upon this resolution. The church in West
Hartford is waiting upon this vote with deep solicitude. That
congregation's real estate stands at a low figure. What they are
anxious to have now above everything else under God, is a
price-raiser. Dismiss Mr. Twichell tonight, and they will hire
him to-morrow. Prices there will go up; prices here will go down.
That is all. I move the vote."</p>

<p>Twichell was not dismissed. That was twenty-two years ago. It
was Twichell's first pulpit after his consecration to his
vocation. He occupies it yet, and has never had another. The
fortieth anniversary of his accession to it was celebrated by
that congregation and its descendants a couple of weeks ago, and
there was great enthusiasm. Twichell has never made any political
mistakes since. His persistency in voting right has been an
exasperation to me these many years and has been the cause and
inspiration of more than one vicious letter from me to him. But
the viciousness was all a pretense. I have never found any real
fault with him for voting his infernal Republican ticket, for the
reason that, situated as he was, with a large family to support,
his first duty was not to his political conscience, but to his
family conscience. A sacrifice had to be made; a duty had to be
performed. His very first duty was to his family, not to his
political conscience. He sacrificed his political independence,
and saved his family by it. In the circumstances, this was the
highest loyalty, and the best. If he had been a Henry Ward
Beecher it would not have been his privilege to sacrifice his
political conscience, because in case of dismissal a thousand
pulpits would have been open to him, and his family's bread
secure. In Twichell's case, there would have been some risk--in
fact, a good deal of risk. That he, or any other expert, could
have raised the prices of real estate in West Hartford is, to my
mind, exceedingly doubtful. I think Mr. Hubbard worked his
imagination to the straining point when he got up that scare that
night. I believe it was safest for Twichell to remain where he
was if he could. He saved his family, and that was his first
duty, in my opinion.</p>

<p>In this country there are perhaps eighty thousand preachers.
Not more than twenty of them are politically independent--the
rest cannot be politically independent. They must vote the ticket
of their congregations. They do it, and are justified. They
themselves are mainly the reason why they have no political
independence, for they do not preach political independence from
their pulpits. They have their large share in the fact that the
people of this nation have no political independence.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>New York, February 1, 1906</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>To-morrow will be the thirty-sixth anniversary of our
marriage. My wife passed from this life one year and eight months
ago, in Florence, Italy, after an unbroken illness of twenty-two
months' duration.</p>

<p>I saw her first in the form of an ivory miniature in her
brother Charley's stateroom in the steamer <i>Quaker City</i> in
the Bay of Smyrna, in the summer of 1867, when she was in her
twenty-second year. I saw her in the flesh for the first time in
New York in the following December. She was slender and beautiful
and girlish--and she was both girl and woman. She remained both
girl and woman to the last day of her life. Under a grave and
gentle exterior burned inextinguishable fires of sympathy,
energy, devotion, enthusiasm, and absolutely limitless affection.
She was <i>always</i> frail in body, and she lived upon her
spirit, whose hopefulness and courage were indestructible.
Perfect truth, perfect honesty, perfect candor, were qualities of
her character which were born with her. Her judgments of people
and things were sure and accurate. Her intuitions almost never
deceived her. In her judgments of the characters and acts of both
friends and strangers there was always room for charity, and this
charity never failed. I have compared and contrasted her with
hundreds of persons, and my conviction remains that hers was the
most perfect character I have ever met. And I may add that she
was the most winningly dignified person I have ever known. Her
character and disposition were of the sort that not only invite
worship, but command it. No servant ever left her service who
deserved to remain in it. And as she could choose with a glance
of her eye, the servants she selected did in almost all cases
deserve to remain, and they <i>did</i> remain. She was always
cheerful; and she was always able to communicate her cheerfulness
to others. During the nine years that we spent in poverty and
debt she was always able to reason me out of my despairs and find
a bright side to the clouds and make me see it. In all that time
I never knew her to utter a word of regret concerning our altered
circumstances, nor did I ever know her children to do the like.
For she had taught them, and they drew their fortitude from her.
The love which she bestowed upon those whom she loved took the
form of worship, and in that form it was returned--returned by
relatives, friends, and the servants of her household. It was a
strange combination which wrought into one individual, so to
speak by marriage--her disposition and character and mine. She
poured out her prodigal affections in kisses and caresses, and in
a vocabulary of endearments whose profusion was always an
astonishment to me. I was born <i>reserved</i> as to endearments
of speech, and caresses, and hers broke upon me as the summer
waves break upon Gibraltar. I was reared in that atmosphere of
reserve. As I have already said, I never knew a member of my
father's family to kiss another member of it except once, and
that at a deathbed. And our village was not a kissing community.
The kissing and caressing ended with courtship--along with the
deadly piano-playing of that day.</p>

<p>She had the heart-free laugh of a girl. It came seldom, but
when it broke upon the ear it was as inspiring as music. I heard
it for the last time when she had been occupying her sick bed for
more than a year, and I made a written note of it at the time--a
note not to be repeated.</p>

<p>To-morrow will be the thirty-sixth anniversary. We were
married in her father's house in Elmira, New York, and went next
day, by special train, to Buffalo, along with the whole Langdon
family, and with the Beechers and the Twichells, who had
solemnized the marriage. We were to live in Buffalo, where I was
to be one of the editors of the Buffalo <i>Express</i> and a part
owner of the paper. I knew nothing about Buffalo, but I had made
my household arrangements there through a friend, by letter. I
had instructed him to find a boarding-house of as respectable a
character as my light salary as editor would command. We were
received at about nine o'clock at the station in Buffalo and were
put into several sleighs and driven all over America, as it
seemed to me--for apparently we turned all the corners in the
town and followed all the streets there were--I scolding freely
and characterizing that friend of mine in very uncomplimentary
ways for securing a boarding-house that apparently had no
definite locality. But there was a conspiracy--and my bride knew
of it, but I was in ignorance. Her father, Jervis Langdon, had
bought and furnished a new house for us in the fashionable
street, Delaware Avenue, and had laid in a cook and housemaids
and a brisk and electric young coachman, an Irishman, Patrick
McAleer--and we were being driven all over that city in order
that one sleighful of these people could have time to go to the
house and see that the gas was lighted all over it, and a hot
supper prepared for the crowd. We arrived at last, and when I
entered that fairy place my indignation reached high-water mark,
and without any reserve I delivered my opinion to that friend of
mine for being so stupid as to put us into a boarding-house whose
terms would be far out of my reach. Then Mr. Langdon brought
forward a very pretty box and opened it and took from it a deed
of the house. So the comedy ended very pleasantly and we sat down
to supper.</p>

<p>The company departed about midnight, and left us alone in our
new quarters. Then Ellen, the cook, came in to get orders for the
morning's marketing--and neither of us knew whether beefsteak was
sold by the barrel or by the yard. We exposed our ignorance, and
Ellen was full of Irish delight over it. Patrick McAleer, that
brisk young Irishman, came in to get his orders for next day--and
that was our first glimpse of him.</p>

<p>Thirty-six years have gone by. And this letter from Twichell
comes this morning, from Hartford:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>HARTFORD, <i>January 31.</i></p>

<p>DEAR MARK:</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that the news about Patrick is very bad. I
saw him Monday. He <i>looked</i> pretty well and was in cheerful
spirits. He told me that he was fast recovering from an operation
performed on him last week Wednesday, and would soon be out
again. But a nurse who followed me from the room when I left told
me that the poor fellow was deceived. The operation had simply
disclosed the fact that nothing could be done for him.</p>

<p>Yesterday I asked the surgeon (Johnson, living opposite us) if
that were so. He said "Yes," that the trouble was cancer of the
liver and that there was no help for it in surgery; the case was
quite hopeless; the end was not many weeks off. A pitiful case,
indeed!</p>

<p>Poor Patrick! His face brightened when he saw me. He told me,
the first thing, that he had just heard from Jean. His wife and
son were with him. Whether they suspect the truth I don't know. I
doubt if the wife does; but the son looked very sober. Maybe he
only has been told.</p>

<p>Yrs. aff.,</p>

<p>JOE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Jean had kept watch of Patrick's case by correspondence with
Patrick's daughter Nancy, and so we already knew that it was
hopeless. In fact, the end seems to be nearer than Twichell
suspects. Last night I sent Twichell word that I <i>knew</i>
Patrick had only a day or two to live, and he must not forget to
provide a memorial wreath and pin a card to it with my name and
Clara's and Jean's signed to it, worded, "In loving remembrance
of Patrick McAleer, faithful and valued friend of our family for
thirty-six years."</p>

<p>I wanted to say that he had <i>served</i> us thirty-six years,
but some people would not have understood that. He served us
constantly for twenty-one years. Then came that break when we
spent nine or ten years in Europe. But if Patrick himself could
see his funeral wreath--then I should certainly say, in so many
words, that he served us thirty-six years. For last summer, when
we were located in the New Hampshire hills, at Dublin, we had
Patrick with us. Jean had gone to Hartford the 1st of May and
secured his services for the summer. Necessarily, a part of our
household was Katy Leary, who has been on our roster for
twenty-six years, and one day Jean overheard Katy and Patrick
disputing about this length of service. Katy said she had served
the family longer than Patrick had. Patrick said it was nothing
of the kind; that he had already served the family ten years when
Katy came, and that he had now served it thirty-six years.</p>

<p>He was just as brisk there in the New Hampshire hills as he
was thirty-six years ago. He was sixty-four years old, but was
just as slender and trim and handsome, and just as alert and
springy on his feet, as he was in those long-vanished days of his
youth. He was the most perfect man in his office that I have ever
known, for this reason: that he never neglected any detail,
howsoever slight, of his duties, and there was never any occasion
to give him an order about anything. He conducted his affairs
without anybody's help. There was always plenty of feed for the
horses; the horses were always shod when they needed to be shod;
the carriages and sleighs were always attended to; he kept
everything in perfect order. It was a great satisfaction to have
such a man around. I was not capable of telling anybody what to
do about anything. He was my particular servant, and I didn't
need to tell him anything at all. He was just the same in the New
Hampshire hills. I never gave him an order while he was there,
the whole five months; and there was never anything lacking that
belonged in his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>When we had been married a year or two Patrick took a wife,
and they lived in a house which we built and added to the stable.
They reared eight children. They lost one, two or three years
ago--a thriving young man, assistant editor of a Hartford daily
paper, I think. The children were all educated in the public
schools and in the high school. They are all men and women now,
of course. . . .</p>

<p>Our first child, Langdon Clemens, was born the 7th of
November, 1870, and lived twenty-two months. Susy was born the
19th of March, 1872, and passed from life in the Hartford home,
the 18th of August, 1896. With her, when the end came, were Jean,
and Katy Leary, and John and Ellen (the gardener and his wife).
Clara and her mother and I arrived in England from around the
world on the 31st of July, and took a house in Guildford. A week
later, when Susy, Katy, and Jean should have been arriving from
America, we got a letter instead.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>New York, Friday, February 2, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Subject of February first continued.--The death of Susy
Clemens. Ends with mention of Dr. John Brown.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>It explained that Susy was slightly ill--nothing of
consequence. But we were disquieted and began to cable for later
news. This was Friday. All day no answer--and the ship to leave
Southampton next day, at noon. Clara and her mother began
packing, to be ready in case the news should be bad. Finally came
a cablegram saying, "Wait for cablegram in the morning." This was
not satisfactory--not reassuring. I cabled again, asking that the
answer be sent to Southampton, for the day was now closing. I
waited in the post-office that night till the doors were closed,
toward midnight, in the hope that good news might still come, but
there was no message. We sat silent at home till one in the
morning, waiting--waiting for we knew not what. Then we took the
earliest morning train, and when we reached Southampton the
message was there. It said the recovery would be long, but
certain. This was a great relief to me, but not to my wife. She
was frightened. She and Clara went aboard the steamer at once and
sailed for America, to nurse Susy. I remained behind to search
for another and larger house in Guildford.</p>

<p>That was the 15th of August, 1896. Three days later, when my
wife and Clara were about halfway across the ocean, I was
standing in our dining-room, thinking of nothing in particular,
when a cablegram was put into my hand. It said, "Susy was
peacefully released to-day."</p>

<p>It is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man, all
unprepared, can receive a thunder-stroke like that and live.
There is but one reasonable explanation of it. The intellect is
stunned by the shock and but gropingly gathers the meaning of the
words. The power to realize their full import is mercifully
wanting. The mind has a dumb sense of vast loss--that is all. It
will take mind and memory months, and possibly years, to gather
together the details and thus learn and know the whole extent of
the loss. A man's house burns down. The smoking wreckage
represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use
and pleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go
on, first he misses this, then that, then the other thing. And
when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house.
Always it is an <i>essential</i>--there was but one of its kind.
It cannot be replaced. It was in that house. It is irrevocably
lost. He did not realize that it was an essential when he had it;
he only discovers it now when he finds himself balked, hampered,
by its absence. It will be years before the tale of lost
essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know the
magnitude of his disaster.</p>

<p>The 18th of August brought me the awful tidings. The mother
and the sister were out there in mid-Atlantic, ignorant of what
was happening, flying to meet this incredible calamity. All that
could be done to protect them from the full force of the shock
was done by relatives and good friends. They went down the Bay
and met the ship at night, but did not show themselves until
morning, and then only to Clara. When she returned to the
stateroom she did not speak, and did not need to. Her mother
looked at her and said, "Susy is dead."</p>

<p>At half past ten o'clock that night Clara and her mother
completed their circuit of the globe, and drew up at Elmira by
the same train and in the same car which had borne them and me
westward from it one year, one month, and one week before. And
again Susy was there--not waving her welcome in the glare of the
lights as she had waved her farewell to us thirteen months
before, but lying white and fair in her coffin, in the house
where she was born.</p>

<p>The last thirteen days of Susy's life were spent in our own
house in Hartford, the home of her childhood and always the
dearest place in the earth to her. About her she had faithful old
friends--her pastor, Mr. Twichell, who had known her from the
cradle and who had come a long journey to be with her; her uncle
and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Crane; Patrick, the coachman;
Katy, who had begun to serve us when Susy was a child of eight
years; John and Ellen, who had been with us many years. Also Jean
was there.</p>

<p>At the hour when my wife and Clara set sail for America, Susy
was in no danger. Three hours later there came a sudden change
for the worse. Meningitis set in, and it was immediately apparent
that she was death-struck. That was Saturday, the 15th of
August.</p>

<p>"That evening she took food for the last time." (Jean's letter
to me.) The next morning the brain fever was raging. She walked
the floor a little in her pain and delirium, then succumbed to
weakness and returned to her bed. Previously she had found
hanging in a closet a gown which she had seen her mother wear.
She thought it was her mother, dead, and she kissed it and cried.
About noon she became blind (an effect of the disease) and
bewailed it to her uncle.</p>

<p>From Jean's letter I take this sentence, which needs no
comment:</p>

<p>"About one in the afternoon Susy spoke for the last time."</p>

<p>It was only one word that she said when she spoke that last
time, and it told of her longing. She groped with her hands and
found Katy, and caressed her face and said, "Mamma."</p>

<p>How gracious it was that in that forlorn hour of wreck and
ruin, with the night of death closing around her, she should have
been granted that beautiful illusion--that the latest vision
which rested upon the clouded mirror of her mind should have been
the vision of her mother, and the latest emotion she should know
in life the joy and peace of that dear imagined presence.</p>

<p>About two o'clock she composed herself as if for sleep, and
never moved again. She fell into unconsciousness and so remained
two days and five hours, until Tuesday evening at seven minutes
past seven, when the release came. She was twenty-four years and
five months old.</p>

<p>On the 23d her mother and her sisters saw her laid to
rest--she that had been our wonder and our worship.</p>

<p>The summer seasons of Susy's childhood were spent at Quarry
Farm on the hills east of Elmira, New York; the other seasons of
the year at the home in Hartford. Like other children, she was
blithe and happy, fond of play; <i>unlike</i> the average of
children, she was at times much given to retiring within herself
and trying to search out the hidden meanings of the deep things
that make the puzzle and pathos of human existence, and in all
the ages have baffled the inquirer and mocked him. As a little
child aged seven, she was oppressed and perplexed by the
maddening repetition of the stock incidents of our race's
fleeting sojourn here, just as the same thing has oppressed and
perplexed maturer minds from the beginning of time. A myriad of
men are born; they labor and sweat and struggle for bread; they
squabble and scold and fight; they scramble for little mean
advantages over each other. Age creeps upon them; infirmities
follow; shames and humiliations bring down their prides and their
vanities. Those they love are taken from them, and the joy of
life is turned to aching grief. The burden of pain, care, misery,
grows heavier year by year. At length ambition is dead; pride is
dead; vanity is dead; longing for release is in their place. It
comes at last--the only unpoisoned gift earth ever had for
them--and they vanish from a world where they were of no
consequence; where they achieved nothing; where they were a
mistake and a failure and a foolishness; where they have left no
sign that they have existed--a world which will lament them a day
and forget them forever. Then another myriad takes their place,
and copies all they did, and goes along the same profitless road,
and vanishes as they vanished--to make room for another and
another and a million other myriads to follow the same arid path
through the same desert and accomplish what the first myriad, and
all the myriads that came after it, accomplished--nothing!</p>

<p>"Mamma, what is it all for?" asked Susy, preliminarily stating
the above details in her own halting language, after long
brooding over them alone in the privacy of the nursery.</p>

<p>A year later, she was groping her way alone through another
sunless bog, but this time she reached a rest for her feet. For a
week, her mother had not been able to go to the nursery,
evenings, at the child's prayer hour. She spoke of it--was sorry
for it, and said she would come to-night, and hoped she could
continue to come every night and hear Susy pray, as before.
Noticing that the child wished to respond, but was evidently
troubled as to how to word her answer, she asked what the
difficulty was. Susy explained that Miss Foote (the governess)
had been teaching her about the Indians and their religious
beliefs, whereby it appeared that they had not only a god, but
several. This had set Susy to thinking. As a result of this
thinking she had stopped praying. She qualified this
statement--that is, she modified it--saying she did not now pray
"in the same way" as she had formerly done. Her mother said,
"Tell me about it, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, the Indians believed they knew, but now we know
they were wrong. By and by it can turn out that we are wrong. So
now I only pray that there may be a God and a heaven--or
something better."</p>

<p>I wrote down this pathetic prayer in its precise wording, at
the time, in a record which we kept of the children's sayings,
and my reverence for it has grown with the years that have passed
over my head since then. Its untaught grace and simplicity are a
child's, but the wisdom and the pathos of it are of all the ages
that have come and gone since the race of man has lived, and
longed, and hoped, and feared, and doubted.</p>

<p>To go back a year--Susy aged seven. Several times her mother
said to her, "There, there, Susy, you mustn't cry over little
things."</p>

<p>This furnished Susy a text for thought. She had been breaking
her heart over what had seemed vast disasters--a broken toy; a
picnic canceled by thunder and lightning and rain; the mouse that
was growing tame and friendly in the nursery caught and killed by
the cat--and now came this strange revelation. For some
unaccountable reason, these were not vast calamities. Why? How is
the size of calamities measured? What is the rule? There must be
some way to tell the great ones from the small ones; what is the
law of these proportions? She examined the problem earnestly and
long. She gave it her best thought, from time to time, for two or
three days--but it baffled her--defeated her. And at last she
gave up and went to her mother for help.</p>

<p>"Mamma, what is 'little things'?"</p>

<p>It seemed a simple question--at first. And yet before the
answer could be put into words, unsuspected and unforeseen
difficulties began to appear. They increased; they multiplied;
they brought about another defeat. The effort to explain came to
a standstill. Then Susy tried to help her mother out--with an
instance, an example, an illustration. The mother was getting
ready to go downtown, and one of her errands was to buy a
long-promised toy watch for Susy.</p>

<p>"If you forgot the watch, mamma, would that be a little
thing?"</p>

<p>She was not concerned about the watch, for she knew it would
not be forgotten. What she was hoping for was that the answer
would unriddle the riddle and bring rest and peace to her
perplexed little mind.</p>

<p>The hope was disappointed, of course--for the reason that the
size of a misfortune is not determinable by an outsider's
measurement of it, but only by the measurements applied to it by
the person specially affected by it. The king's lost crown is a
vast matter to the king, but of no consequence to the child. The
lost toy is a great matter to the child, but in the king's eyes
it is not a thing to break the heart about. A verdict was
reached, but it was based upon the above model, and Susy was
granted leave to measure her disasters thereafter with her own
tape-line.</p>

<p>I will throw in a note or two here touching the time when Susy
was seventeen. She had written a play modeled upon Greek lines,
and she and Clara and Margaret Warner, and other young comrades,
had played it to a charmed houseful of friends in our house in
Hartford. Charles Dudley Warner and his brother, George, were
present. They were near neighbors and warm friends of ours. They
were full of praises of the workmanship of the play, and George
Warner came over the next morning and had a long talk with Susy.
The result of it was this verdict:</p>

<p>"She is the most interesting person I have ever known, of
either sex."</p>

<p>Remark of a lady--Mrs. Cheney, I think, author of the
biography of her father, Rev. Dr. Bushnell:</p>

<p>"I made this note after one of my talks with Susy: 'She knows
all there is of life and its meanings. She could not know it
better if she had lived it out to its limit. Her intuitions and
ponderings and analyzings seem to have taught her all that my
sixty years have taught me.'"</p>

<p>Remark of another lady; she is speaking of Susy's last
days:</p>

<p>"In those last days she walked as if on air, and her walk
answered to the buoyancy of her spirits and the passion of
intellectual energy and activity that possessed her."</p>

<p>I return now to the point where I made this diversion. From
her earliest days, as I have already indicated, Susy was given to
examining things and thinking them out by herself. She was not
trained to this; it was the make of her mind. In matters
involving questions of fair or unfair dealing, she reviewed the
details patiently and surely arrived at a right and logical
conclusion. In Munich, when she was six years old, she was
harassed by a recurrent dream, in which a ferocious bear figured.
She came out of the dream each time sorely frightened, and
crying. She set herself the task of analyzing this dream. The
reasons of it? The purpose of it? The origin of it? No--the moral
aspect of it. Her verdict, arrived at after candid and searching
investigation, exposed it to the charge of being one-sided and
unfair in its construction: for (as she worded it) <i>she</i> was
"never the one that ate, but always the one that was eaten."</p>

<p>Susy backed her good judgment in matters of morals with
conduct to match--even upon occasions when it caused her
sacrifice to do it. When she was six and her sister Clara four,
the pair were troublesomely quarrelsome. Punishments were tried
as a means of breaking up this custom--these failed. Then rewards
were tried. A day without a quarrel brought candy. The children
were their own witnesses--each for or against her own self. Once
Susy took the candy, hesitated, then returned it with a
suggestion that she was not fairly entitled to it. Clara kept
hers, so, here was a conflict of evidence--one witness <i>for</i>
a quarrel, and one against it. But the better witness of the two
was on the affirmative side, and the quarrel stood proved, and no
candy due to either side. There seemed to be no defense for
Clara--yet there was, and Susy furnished it; and Clara went free.
Susy said, "I don't know whether she felt wrong in <i>her</i>
heart, but I didn't feel right in <i>my</i> heart."</p>

<p>It was a fair and honorable view of the case, and a specially
acute analysis of it for a child of six to make. There was no way
to convict Clara now, except to put her on the stand again and
review her evidence. There was a doubt as to the fairness of this
procedure, since her former evidence had been accepted, and not
challenged at the time. The doubt was examined, and
canvassed--then she was given the benefit of it and acquitted;
which was just as well, for in the meantime she had eaten the
candy, anyway.</p>

<p>Whenever I think of Susy I think of Marjorie Fleming. There
was but one Marjorie Fleming. There can never be another. No
doubt I think of Marjorie when I think of Susy mainly because Dr.
John Brown, that noble and beautiful soul--rescuer of marvelous
Marjorie from oblivion--was Susy's great friend in her
babyhood--her worshiper and willing slave.</p>

<p>In 1873, when Susy was fourteen months old, we arrived in
Edinburgh from London, fleeing thither for rest and refuge, after
experiencing what had been to us an entirely new kind of
life--six weeks of daily lunches, teas, and dinners away from
home. We carried no letters of introduction; we hid ourselves
away in Veitch's family hotel in George Street and prepared to
have a comfortable season all to ourselves. But by good fortune
this did not happen. Straightway Mrs. Clemens needed a physician,
and I stepped around to 23 Rutland Street to see if the author of
<i>Rab and His Friends</i> was still a practicing physician. He
was. He came, and for six weeks thereafter we were together every
day, either in his house or in our hotel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>New York, Monday, February 5, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Dr. John Brown continued.--Incidents connected with Susy
Clemens's childhood.--Bad spelling, etc.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>His was a sweet and winning face--as beautiful a face as I
have ever known. Reposeful, gentle, benignant--the face of a
saint at peace with all the world and placidly beaming upon it
the sunshine of love that filled his heart. Doctor John was
beloved by everybody in Scotland; and I think that on its
downward sweep southward it found no frontier, I think so because
when, a few years later, infirmities compelled Doctor John to
give up his practice, and Mr. Douglas, the publisher, and other
friend set themselves the task of raising a fund of a few
thousand dollars, whose income was to be devoted to the support
of himself and his maiden sister (who was in age), the fund was
not only promptly made up, but so <i>very</i> promptly that the
books were closed before friends a hundred miles south of the
line had had an opportunity to contribute. No public appeal was
made. The matter was never mentioned in print. Mr. Douglas and
the other friends applied for contributions by private letter
only. Many complaints came from London, and everywhere between,
from people who had not been allowed an opportunity to
contribute. This sort of complaint is so new to the world--so
strikingly unusual--that I think it worth while to mention
it.</p>

<p>Doctor John was very fond of animals, and particularly of
dogs. No one needs to be told this who has read that pathetic and
beautiful masterpiece, <i>Rab and His Friends.</i> After his
death, his son, Jock, published a brief memorial of him which he
distributed privately among the friends; and in it occurs a
little episode which illustrates the relationship that existed
between Doctor John and the other animals. It is furnished by an
Edinburgh lady whom Doctor John used to pick up and carry to
school or back in his carriage frequently at a time when she was
twelve years old. She said that they were chatting together
tranquilly one day, when he suddenly broke off in the midst of a
sentence and thrust his head out of the carriage window
eagerly--then resumed his place with a disappointed look on his
face. The girl said: "Who is it? Some one you know?" He said,
"No, a dog I don't know."</p>

<p>He had two names for Susy--"Wee wifie" and "megalopis." This
formidable Greek title was conferred in honor of her big, big
dark eyes. Susy and the Doctor had a good deal of romping
together. Daily he unbent his dignity and played "bear" with the
child, I do not now remember which of them was the bear, but I
think it was the child. There was a sofa across a corner of the
parlor with a door behind it opening into Susy's quarters, and
she used to lie in wait for the Doctor behind the sofa--not lie
in wait, but stand in wait; for you could only get just a glimpse
of the top of her yellow head when she stood upright. According
to the rules of the game, she was invisible, and this glimpse did
not count. I think she must have been the bear, for I can
remember two or three occasions when she sprang out from behind
the sofa and surprised the Doctor into frenzies of fright, which
were not in the least modified by the fact that he knew that the
"bear" was there and was coming.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that Doctor John should ever have wanted
to tell a grotesque and rollicking anecdote. Such a thing seems
so out of character with that gentle and tranquil nature
that--but no matter. I tried to teach him the anecdote, and he
tried his best for two or three days to perfect himself in
it--and he never succeeded. It was the most impressive exhibition
that ever was. There was no human being, nor dog, of his
acquaintance in all Edinburgh that would not have been paralyzed
with astonishment to step in there and see Doctor John trying to
do that anecdote. It was one which I have told some hundreds of
times on the platform, and which I was always very fond of,
because it worked the audience so hard. It was a stammering man's
account of how he got cured of his infirmity--which was
accomplished by introducing a whistle into the midst of every
word which he found himself unable to finish on account of the
obstruction of the stammering. And so his whole account was an
absurd mixture of stammering and whistling--which was
irresistible to an audience properly keyed up for laughter.
Doctor John learned to do the mechanical details of the anecdote,
but he was never able to inform these details with expression. He
was preternaturally grave and earnest all through, and so when he
fetched up with the climaxing triumphant sentence at the end--but
I must quote that sentence, or the reader will not understand. It
was this:</p>

<p>"The doctor told me that whenever I wanted to sta--(whistle)
sta--(whistle) sta--(whistle) <i>am-mer</i><i>,</i> I must
whistle; and I did, and it k--(whistle) k- (whistle) k- (whistle)
k- ured me <i>entirely</i><i>!"</i></p>

<p>The Doctor could not master that triumphant note. He always
gravely stammered and whistled and whistled and stammered it
through, and it came out at the end with the solemnity and the
gravity of the judge delivering sentence to a man with the black
cap on.</p>

<p>He was the loveliest creature in the world--except his aged
sister, who was just like him. We made the round of his
professional visits with him in his carriage every day for six
weeks. He always brought a basket of grapes, and we brought
books. The scheme which we began with on the first round of
visits was the one which was maintained until the end--and was
based upon this remark, which he made when he was disembarking
from the carriage at his first stopping place, to visit a
patient, "Entertain yourselves while I go in here and reduce the
population."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As a child, Susy had a passionate temper; and it cost her much
remorse and many tears before she learned to govern it, but after
that it was a wholesome salt, and her character was the stronger
and healthier for its presence. It enabled her to be good with
dignity; it preserved her not only from being good for vanity's
sake, but from even the appearance of it. In looking back over
the long-vanished years it seems but natural and excusable that I
should dwell with longing affection and preference upon incidents
of her young life which made it beautiful to us, and that I
should let its few and small offenses go unsummoned and
unreproached.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1880, when Susy was just eight years of age,
the family were at Quarry Farm, on top of a high hill, three
miles from Elmira, New York, where we always spent our summers,
in those days. Hay-cutting time was approaching, and Susy and
Clara were counting the hours, for the time was big with a great
event for them; they had been promised that they might mount the
wagon and ride home from the fields on the summit of the hay
mountain. This perilous privilege, so dear to their age and
species, had never been granted them before. Their excitement had
no bounds. They could talk of nothing but this epoch-making
adventure, now. But misfortune overtook Susy on the very morning
of the important day. In a sudden outbreak of passion she
corrected Clara--with a shovel, or stick, or something of the
sort. At any rate, the offense committed was of a gravity clearly
beyond the limit allowed in the nursery. In accordance with the
rule and custom of the house, Susy went to her mother to confess
and to help decide upon the size and character of the punishment
due. It was quite understood that as a punishment could have but
one rational object and function--to act as a reminder and warn
the transgressor against transgressing in the same way again--the
children would know about as well as any how to choose a penalty
which would be rememberable and effective. Susy and her mother
discussed various punishments, but none of them seemed adequate.
This fault was an unusually serious one, and required the setting
up of a danger signal in the memory that would not blow out nor
burn out, but remain a fixture there and furnish its saving
warning indefinitely. Among the punishments mentioned was
deprivation of the hay-wagon ride. It was noticeable that this
one hit Susy hard. Finally, in the summing up, the mother named
over the list and asked, "Which one do you think it ought to be,
Susy?"</p>

<p>Susy studied, shrank from her duty, and asked, "Which do you
think, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Well, Susy, I would rather leave it to you. <i>You</i> make
the choice, yourself."</p>

<p>It cost Susy a struggle, and much and deep thinking and
weighing--but she came out where anyone who knew her could have
foretold she would:</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, I'll make it the hay wagon, because, you know,
the other things might not make me remember not to do it again,
but if I don't get to ride on the hay wagon I can remember it
easily."</p>

<p>In this world the real penalty, the sharp one, the lasting
one, never falls otherwise than on the wrong person. It was not
<i>I</i> that corrected Clara, but the remembrance of poor Susy's
lost hay ride still brings <i>me</i> a pang--after twenty-six
years.</p>

<p>Apparently Susy was born with humane feelings for the animals
and compassion for their troubles. This enabled her to see a new
point in an old story, once, when she was only six years old--a
point which had been overlooked by older, and perhaps duller,
people for many ages. Her mother told her the moving story of the
sale of Joseph by his brethren, the staining of his coat with the
blood of the slaughtered kid, and the rest of it. She dwelt upon
the inhumanity of the brothers, their cruelty toward their
helpless young brother, and the unbrotherly treachery which they
practiced upon him; for she hoped to teach the child a lesson in
gentle pity and mercifulness which she would remember. Apparently
her desire was accomplished, for the tears came into Susy's eyes
and she was deeply moved. Then she said, "Poor little kid!"</p>

<p>A child's frank envy of the privileges and distinctions of its
elders is often a delicately flattering attention and the reverse
of unwelcome, but sometimes the envy is not placed where the
beneficiary is expecting it to be placed. Once when Susy was
seven, she sat breathlessly absorbed in watching a guest of ours
adorn herself for a ball. The lady was charmed by this homage,
this mute and gentle admiration, and was happy in it. And when
her pretty labors were finished, and she stood at last perfect,
unimprovable, clothed like Solomon in his glory, she paused,
confident and expectant, to receive from Susy's tongue the
tribute that was burning in her eyes. Susy drew an envious little
sigh and said, "I wish <i>I</i> could have crooked teeth and
spectacles!"</p>

<p>Once, when Susy was six months along in her eighth year, she
did something one day in the presence of company which subjected
her to criticism and reproof. Afterward, when she was alone with
her mother, as was her custom she reflected a little while over
the matter. Then she set up what I think--and what the shade of
Burns would think--was a quite good philosophical defense: "Well,
mamma, you know I didn't see myself, and so I couldn't know how
it looked."</p>

<p>In homes where the near friends and visitors are mainly
literary people--lawyers, judges, professors, and clergymen--the
children's ears become early familiarized with wide vocabularies.
It is natural for them to pick up any words that fall in their
way; it is natural for them to pick up big and little ones
indiscriminately; it is natural for them to use without fear any
word that comes to their net, no matter how formidable it may be
as to size. As a result, their talk is a curious and funny
musketry-clatter of little words, interrupted at intervals by the
heavy-artillery crash of a word of such imposing sound and size
that it seems to shake the ground and rattle the windows.
Sometimes the child gets a wrong idea of a word which it has
picked up by chance, and attaches to it a meaning which impairs
its usefulness--but this does not happen as often as one might
expect it would. Indeed, it happens with an infrequency which may
be regarded as remarkable. As a child, Susy had good fortune with
her large words, and she employed many of them. She made no more
than her fair share of mistakes. Once when she thought something
very funny was going to happen (but it didn't) she was racked and
torn with laughter, by anticipation. But apparently she still
felt sure of her position, for she said, "If it had happened, I
should have been transformed [transported] with glee."</p>

<p>And earlier, when she was a little maid of five years, she
informed a visitor that she had been in a church only once, and
that was the time when Clara was "crucified" (christened).</p>

<p>In Heidelberg, when she was six, she noticed that the Schloss
gardens--</p>

<p>Dear me, how remote things do come together! I break off that
sentence to remark that at a luncheon uptown yesterday, I
reminded the hostess that she had not made me acquainted with all
the guests. She said yes, she was aware of that--that by request
of one of the ladies she had left me to guess that lady out for
myself; that I had known that lady for a day, more than a quarter
of a century ago, and that the lady was desirous of finding out
how long it would take me to dig her up out of my memory. The
rest of the company were in the game and were anxious to see
whether I would succeed or fail. It seemed to me, as the time
drifted along, that I was never going to be able to locate that
woman; but at last, when the luncheon was nearly finished, a
discussion broke out as to where the most comfortable hotel in
the world was to be found. Various hotels on the several sides of
the ocean were mentioned, and at last somebody reminded her that
she had not put forward a preference yet, and she was asked to
name the hotel that she thought was, from her point of view, the
most satisfactory and comfortable hotel on the planet, and she
said, promptly, "The 'Slosh,' at Heidelberg."</p>

<p>I said at once, "I am sincerely glad to meet you again, Mrs.
Jones, after this long stretch of years--but you were Miss Smith
in those days. Have I located you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "you have."</p>

<p>I <i>knew</i> I had. During that day at Heidelberg, so many
ages ago, many charitable people tried furtively to get that
young Miss Smith to adopt the prevailing pronunciation of
Schloss, by <i>saying</i> Schloss softly and casually every time
she said "Slosh," but nobody succeeded in converting her. And I
knew perfectly well that this was that same old Smith girl,
because there could not be two persons on this planet at one and
the same time who could preserve and stick to a mispronunciation
like that for nearly a generation.</p>

<p>As I was saying, when I interrupted myself--in Heidelberg,
when Susy was six, she noticed that the Schloss gardens were
populous with snails creeping all about everywhere. One day she
found a new dish on her table and inquired concerning it, and
learned that it was made of snails. She was awed and impressed,
and said, "Wild ones, mamma?"</p>

<p>She was thoughtful and considerate of others--an acquired
quality, no doubt. No one seems to be born with it. One hot day,
at home in Hartford, when she was a little child, her mother
borrowed her fan several times (a Japanese one, value five
cents), refreshed herself with it a moment or two, then handed it
back with a word of thanks. Susy knew her mother would use the
fan all the time if she could do it without putting a deprivation
upon its owner. She also knew that her mother could not be
persuaded to do that. A relief must be devised somehow; Susy
devised it. She got five cents out of her money box and carried
it to Patrick and asked him to take it downtown (a mile and a
half) and buy a Japanese fan and bring it home. He did it--and
thus thoughtfully and delicately was the exigency met and the
mother's comfort secured. It is to the child's credit that she
did not save herself expense by bringing down another and more
costly kind of fan from upstairs, but was content to act upon the
impression that her mother desired the Japanese kind--content to
accomplish the desire and stop with that, without troubling about
the wisdom or unwisdom of it.</p>

<p>Sometimes while she was still a child, her speech fell into
quaint and strikingly expressive forms. Once--aged nine or
ten--she came to her mother's room when her sister Jean was a
baby and said Jean was crying in the nursery, and asked if she
might ring for the nurse. Her mother asked, "Is she crying
hard?"--meaning cross, ugly.</p>

<p>"Well, no, mamma. It is a weary, lonesome cry."</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to me to recall various incidents which
reveal the delicacies of feeling which were so considerable a
part of her budding character. Such a revelation came once in a
way which, while creditable to her heart, was defective in
another direction. She was in her eleventh year, then. Her mother
had been making the Christmas purchases, and she allowed Susy to
see the presents which were for Patrick's children. Among these
was a handsome sled for Jimmy, on which a stag was painted; also
in gilt capitals the word "DEER." Susy was excited and joyous
over everything until she came to this sled. Then she became
sober and silent--yet the sled was the choicest of all the gifts.
Her mother was surprised and also disappointed, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, Susy, doesn't it please you? Isn't it fine?"</p>

<p>Susy hesitated, and it was plain that she did not want to say
the thing that was in her mind. However, being urged, she brought
it haltingly out:</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, it <i>is</i> fine, and of course it <i>did</i>
cost a good deal--but--but--why should that be mentioned?"</p>

<p>Seeing that she was not understood, she reluctantly pointed to
that word "DEER." It was her orthography that was at fault, not
her heart. She had inherited both from her mother.</p>

<p>The ability to spell is a natural gift. The person not born
with it can never become perfect in it. I was always able to
spell correctly. My wife and her sister, Mrs. Crane, were always
bad spellers. Once when Clara was a little chap her mother was
away from home for a few days, and Clara wrote her a small letter
every day. When her mother returned, she praised Clara's letters.
Then she said, "But in one of them, Clara, you spelled a word
wrong."</p>

<p>Clara said, with quite unconscious brutality, "Why, mamma, how
did <i>you</i> know?"</p>

<p>More than a quarter of a century has elapsed, and Mrs. Crane
is under our roof here in New York for a few days. Her head is
white now, but she is as pretty and winning and sweet as she was
in those ancient times at her Quarry Farm, where she was an idol
and the rest of us were the worshipers. Her gift of imperfect
orthography remains unimpaired. She writes a great many letters.
This was always a passion of hers. Yesterday she asked me how to
spell New Jersey, and I knew by her look, after she got the
information, that she was regretting she hadn't asked somebody
years ago. The miracles which she and her sister, Mrs. Clemens,
were able to perform without help of dictionary or spelling book
are incredible. During the year of my engagement--1869--while I
was out on the lecture platform, the daily letter that came for
me generally brought me news from the front--by which expression
I refer to the internecine war that was always going on in a
friendly way between these two orthographists about the spelling
of words. One of these words was scissors. They never seemed to
consult a dictionary; they always wanted something or somebody
that was more reliable. Between them, they had spelled scissors
in seven different ways, a feat which I am certain no person now
living, educated or uneducated, can match. I have forgotten how I
was required to say which of the seven ways was the right one. I
couldn't do it. If there had been fourteen ways, none of them
would have been right. I remember only one of the instances
offered--the other six have passed from my memory. That one was
"sicisiors." That way of spelling it looked so reasonable--so
plausible, to the discoverer of it, that I was hardly believed
when I decided against it. Mrs. Crane keeps by her, to this day,
a little book of about thirty pages of note-paper, on which she
has written, in a large hand, words which she needs to use in her
letters every day--words which the cat could spell without
prompting or tuition, and yet are words which Mrs. Crane never
allows herself to risk upon paper without looking at that
vocabulary of hers, each time, to make certain.</p>

<p>During my engagement year, thirty-seven years ago, a
considerable company of young people amused themselves in the
Langdon homestead one night with the game of Verbarium, which was
brand new at the time and very popular. A text word was chosen
and each person wrote that word in large letters across the top
of a sheet of paper, then sat with pencil in hand and ready to
begin as soon as game was called. The player could begin with the
first letter of that text word and build words out of the text
word during two minutes by the watch. But he must not use a
letter that was not <i>in</i> the text word and he must not use
any letter in the text word twice, unless the letter occurred
twice in the text word. I remember the first bout that we had at
that game. The text word was <i>California.</i> When game was
called everybody began to set down words as fast as he could make
his pencil move--"corn," "car," "cone," and so on, digging out
the shortest words first because they could be set down more
quickly than the longer ones. When the two minutes were up, the
scores were examined, and the prize went to the person who had
achieved the largest number of words. The good scores ranged
along between thirty and fifty or sixty words. But Mrs. Crane
would not allow her score to be examined. She was plainly
doubtful about getting that prize. But when persuasion failed to
avail we chased her about the place, captured her, and took her
score away from her by force. She had achieved only one word, and
that was <i>calf</i>--which she had spelled "caff." And she never
would have gotten even that one word honestly--she had to
introduce a letter that didn't belong in the text word in order
to get it.</p>

<p><i>New York, Tuesday, February 6, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Playing "The Prince and the Pauper."--Acting charades,
etc.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Susy was twelve and a half years old, I took to the
platform again, after a long absence from it, and raked the
country for four months in company with George W. Cable. Early in
November we gave a reading one night in Chickering Hall, in New
York, and when I was walking home in a dull gloom of fog and rain
I heard one invisible man say to another invisible man, this, in
substance: "General Grant has actually concluded to write his
autobiography." That remark gave me joy, at the time, but if I
had been struck by lightning in place of it, it would have been
better for me and mine. However, that is a long story, and this
is not the place for it.</p>

<p>To Susy, as to all Americans, General Grant was the supremest
of heroes, and she longed for a sight of him. I took her to see
him one day--However, let that go. It belongs elsewhere. I will
return to it by and by.</p>

<p>In the midst of our reading campaign, I returned to Hartford
from the far West, reaching home one evening just at dinner time.
I was expecting to have a happy and restful season by a hickory
fire in the library with the family, but was required to go at
once to George Warner's house, a hundred and fifty yards away,
across the grounds. This was a heavy disappointment, and I tried
to beg off, but did not succeed. I couldn't even find out why I
must waste this precious evening in a visit to a friend's house
when our own house offered so many and superior advantages. There
was a mystery somewhere, but I was not able to get to the bottom
of it. So we tramped across in the snow, and I found the Warner
drawing-room crowded with seated people. There was a vacancy in
the front row, for me--in front of a curtain. At once the curtain
was drawn, and before me, properly costumed, was the little maid,
Margaret Warner, clothed in Tom Canty's rags, and beyond an
intercepting railing was Susy Clemens, arrayed in the silks and
satins of the prince. Then followed with good action and spirit
the rest of that first meeting between the prince and the pauper.
It was a charming surprise, and to me a moving one. Other
episodes of the tale followed, and I have seldom in my life
enjoyed an evening so much as I enjoyed that one. This lovely
surprise was my wife's work. She had patched the scenes together
from the book and had trained the six or eight young actors in
their parts, and had also designed and furnished the
costumes.</p>

<p>Afterward, I added a part for myself (Miles Hendon), also a
part for Katy and a part for George. I think I have not mentioned
George before. He was a colored man--the children's darling and a
remarkable person. He had been a member of the family a number of
years at that time. He had been born a slave, in Maryland, was
set free by the Proclamation when he was just entering young
manhood. He was body servant to General Devens all through the
war, and then had come North and for eight or ten years had been
earning his living by odd jobs. He came out to our house once, an
entire stranger, to clean some windows--and remained eighteen
years. Mrs. Clemens could always tell enough about a servant by
the look of him--more, in fact, than she, or anybody else, could
tell about him by his recommendations.</p>

<p>We played "The Prince and the Pauper" a number of times in our
house to seated audiences of eighty-four persons, which was the
limit of our space, and we got great entertainment out of it. As
<i>we</i> played the piece it had several superiorities over the
play as presented on the public stage in England and America, for
we always had both the prince and the pauper on deck, whereas
these parts were always doubled on the public stage--an
economical but unwise departure from the book, because it
necessitated the excision of the strongest and most telling of
the episodes. We made a stirring and handsome thing out of the
coronation scene. This could not be accomplished otherwise than
by having both the prince and the pauper present at the same
time. Clara was the little Lady Jane Grey, and she performed the
part with electrifying spirit. Twichell's littlest cub, now a
grave and reverend clergyman, was a page. He was so small that
people on the back seats could not see him without an
opera-glass, but he held up Lady Jane's train very well. Jean was
only something past three years old, therefore was too young to
have a part, but she produced the whole piece every day
independently, and played all the parts herself. For a one-actor
piece it was not bad. In fact, it was very good--very
entertaining. For she was in very deep earnest, and, besides, she
used an English which none but herself could handle with
effect.</p>

<p>Our children and the neighbors' children played well; easily,
comfortably, naturally, and with high spirit. How was it that
they were able to do this? It was because they had been in
training all the time from their infancy. They grew up in our
house, so to speak, playing charades. We never made any
preparation. We selected a word, whispered the parts of it to the
little actors; then we retired to the hall where all sorts of
costumery had been laid out ready for the evening. We dressed the
parts in three minutes and each detachment marched into the
library and performed its syllable, then retired, leaving the
fathers and mothers to guess that syllable if they could.
Sometimes they could.</p>

<p>Will Gillette, now world-famous actor and dramatist, learned a
part of his trade by acting in our charades. Those little chaps,
Susy and Clara, invented charades themselves in their earliest
years, and played them for the entertainment of their mother and
me. They had one high merit--none but a high-grade intellect
could guess them. Obscurity is a great thing in a charade. These
babies invented one once which was a masterpiece in this regard.
They came in and played the first syllable, which was a
conversation in which the word <i>red</i> occurred with
suggestive frequency. Then they retired--came again, continuing
an angry dispute which they had begun outside, and in which
several words like <i>just, fair, unfair, unjust,</i> and so on,
kept occurring; but we noticed that the word <i>just</i> was in
the majority--so we set that down along with the word <i>red</i>
and discussed the probabilities while the children went out to
recostume themselves. We had thus "red," "just." They soon
appeared and began to do a very fashionable morning call, in
which the one made many inquiries of the other concerning some
lady whose name was persistently suppressed, and who was always
referred to as "her," even when the grammar did not permit of
that form of the pronoun. The children retired. We took an
account of stock and, so far as we could see, we had three
syllables, "red," "just," "her." But that was all. The
combination did not seem to throw any real glare on the future
completed word. The children arrived again, and stooped down and
began to chat and quarrel and carry on, and fumble and fuss at
the <i>register</i><i>!</i>--(red--just--her). With the exception
of myself, this family was never strong on spelling.</p>

<p>In "The Prince and the Pauper" days, and earlier and
later--especially later, Susy and her nearest neighbor, Margaret
Warner, often devised tragedies and played them in the
school-room, with little Jean's help--with closed doors--no
admission to anybody. The chief characters were always a couple
of queens, with a quarrel in stock--historical when possible, but
a quarrel anyway, even if it had to be a work of the imagination.
Jean always had one function--only one. She sat at a little table
about a foot high and drafted death warrants for these queens to
sign. In the course of time they completely wore out Elizabeth
and Mary, Queen of Scots--also all of Mrs. Clemens's gowns that
they could get hold of--for nothing charmed these monarchs like
having four or five feet of gown dragging on the floor behind.
Mrs. Clemens and I spied upon them more than once, which was
treacherous conduct--but I don't think we very seriously minded
that. It was grand to see the queens stride back and forth and
reproach each other in three- or four-syllable words dripping
with blood; and it was pretty to see how tranquil Jean was
through it all. Familiarity with daily death and carnage had
hardened her to crime and suffering in all their forms, and they
were no longer able to hasten her pulse by a beat. Sometimes when
there was a long interval between death warrants she even leaned
her head on her table and went to sleep. It was then a curious
spectacle of innocent repose and crimson and volcanic
tragedy.</p>

<p><i>Susy Clemens's biography of her father.--Mr. Clemens's
opinion of critics, etc.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Susy was thirteen, and was a slender little maid with
plaited tails of copper-tinged brown hair down her back, and was
perhaps the busiest bee in the household hive, by reason of the
manifold studies, health exercises, and recreations she had to
attend to, she secretly, and of her own motion, and out of love,
added another task to her labors--the writing of a biography of
me. She did this work in her bedroom at night, and kept her
record hidden. After a little, the mother discovered it and
filched it, and let me see it; then told Susy what she had done,
and how pleased I was and how proud. I remember that time with a
deep pleasure. I had had compliments before, but none that
touched me like this; none that could approach it for value in my
eyes. It has kept that place always since. I have had no
compliment, no praise, no tribute from any source, that was so
precious to me as this one was and still is. As I read it
<i>now</i><i>,</i> after all these many years, it is still a
king's message to me, and brings me the same dear surprise it
brought me then--with the pathos added of the thought that the
eager and hasty hand that sketched it and scrawled it will not
touch mine again--and I feel as the humble and unexpectant must
feel when their eyes fall upon the edict that raises them to the
ranks of the noble.</p>

<p>Yesterday while I was rummaging in a pile of ancient
note-books of mine which I had not seen for years, I came across
a reference to that biography. It is quite evident that several
times, at breakfast and dinner, in those long-past days, I was
posing for the biography. In fact, I clearly remember that I
<i>was</i> doing that--and I also remember that Susy detected it.
I remember saying a very smart thing, with a good deal of an air,
at the breakfast table one morning, and that Susy observed to her
mother privately, a little later, that papa was doing that for
the biography.</p>

<p>I cannot bring myself to change any line or word in Susy's
sketch of me, but will introduce passages from it now and then
just as they came in--their quaint simplicity out of her honest
heart, which was the beautiful heart of a child. What comes from
that source has a charm and grace of its own which may transgress
all the recognized laws of literature, if it choose, and yet be
literature still, and worthy of hospitality.</p>

<p>The spelling is frequently desperate, but it was Susy's, and
it shall stand. I love it, and cannot profane it. To me, it is
gold. To correct it would alloy it, not refine it. It would spoil
it. It would take from it its freedom and flexibility and make it
stiff and formal. Even when it is most extravagant I am not
shocked. It is Susy's spelling, and she was doing the best she
could--and nothing could better it for me.</p>

<p>She learned languages easily; she learned history easily, she
learned music easily; she learned all things easily, quickly, and
thoroughly--except spelling. She even learned that, after a
while. But it would have grieved me but little if she had failed
in it--for, although good spelling was my one accomplishment, I
was never able to greatly respect it. When I was a schoolboy,
sixty years ago, we had two prizes in our school. One was for
good spelling, the other for amiability. These things were thin,
smooth, silver disks, about the size of a dollar. Upon the one
was engraved in flowing Italian script the words "Good Spelling,"
on the other was engraved the word "Amiability." The holders of
these prizes hung them about the neck with a string--and those
holders were the envy of the whole school. There wasn't a pupil
that wouldn't have given a leg for the privilege of wearing one
of them a week, but no pupil ever got a chance except John
RoBards and me. John RoBards was eternally and indestructibly
amiable. I may even say devilishly amiable; fiendishly amiable;
exasperatingly amiable. That was the sort of feeling that we had
about that quality of his. So he always wore the amiability
medal. I always wore the other medal. That word "always" is a
trifle too strong. We lost the medals several times. It was
because they became so monotonous. We needed a change--therefore
several times we traded medals. It was a satisfaction to John
RoBards to <i>seem</i> to be a good speller--which he wasn't. And
it was a satisfaction to me to seem to be amiable, for a change.
But of course these changes could not long endure--for some
schoolmate or other would presently notice what had been
happening, and that schoolmate would not have been human if he
had lost any time in reporting this treason. The teacher took the
medals away from us at once, of course--and we always had them
back again before Friday night. If we lost the medals Monday
morning, John's amiability was at the top of the list Friday
afternoon when the teacher came to square up the week's account.
The Friday-afternoon session always closed with "spelling down."
Being in disgrace, I necessarily started at the foot of my
division of spellers, but I always slaughtered both divisions and
stood alone with the medal around my neck when the campaign was
finished. I <i>did</i> miss on a word once, just at the end of
one of these conflicts, and so lost the medal. I left the first
<i>r</i> out of February--but that was to accommodate a
sweetheart. My passion was so strong just at that time that I
would have left out the whole alphabet if the word had contained
it.</p>

<p>As I have said before, I never had any large respect for good
spelling. That is my feeling yet. Before the spelling-book came
with its arbitrary forms, men unconsciously revealed shades of
their characters, and also added enlightening shades of
expression to what they wrote by their spelling, and so it is
possible that the spelling-book has been a doubtful benevolence
to us.</p>

<p>Susy began the biography in 1885, when I was in the fiftieth
year of my age, and she in the fourteenth of hers. She begins in
this way:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are a very happy family. We consist of Papa, Mamma, Jean,
Clara and me. It is papa I am writing about, and I shall have no
trouble in not knowing what to say about him, as he is a
<i>very</i> striking character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>But wait a minute--I will return to Susy presently. In the
matter of slavish imitation, man is the monkey's superior all the
time. The average man is destitute of independence of opinion. He
is not interested in contriving an opinion of his own, by study
and reflection, but is only anxious to find out what his
neighbor's opinion is and slavishly adopt it. A generation ago, I
found out that the latest review of a book was pretty sure to be
just a reflection of the <i>earliest</i> review of it. That
whatever the first reviewer found to praise or censure in the
book would be repeated in the latest reviewer's report, with
nothing fresh added.<sup>1</sup> Therefore more than once I took
the precaution of sending my book, in manuscript, to Mr. Howells,
when he was editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly,</i> so that he
could prepare a review of it at leisure. I knew he would say the
truth about the book--I also knew that he would find more merit
than demerit in it, because I already knew that that was the
condition of the book. I allowed no copy of that book to go out
to the press until after Mr. Howells's notice of it had appeared.
That book was always safe. There wasn't a man behind a pen in all
America that had the courage to find anything in the book which
Mr. Howells had not found--there wasn't a man behind a pen in
America that had spirit enough to say a brave and original thing
about the book on his own responsibility.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> Hardly true to-day.--A. B. P.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I believe that the trade of critic, in literature, music, and
the drama, is the most degraded of all trades, and that it has no
real value--certainly no large value. When Charles Dudley Warner
and I were about to bring out <i>The Gilded Age,</i> the editor
of the <i>Daily Graphic</i> persuaded me to let him have an
advance copy, he giving me his word of honor that no notice of it
should appear in his paper until after the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> notice should have appeared. This reptile published a
review of the book within three days afterward, I could not
really complain, because he had only given me his word of honor
as security. I ought to have required of him something
substantial. I believe his notice did not deal mainly with the
merit of the book, or the lack of it, but with my moral attitude
toward the public. It was charged that I had used my reputation
to play a swindle upon the public--that Mr. Warner had written as
much as half of the book, and that I had used my name to float it
and give it currency--a currency which it could not have acquired
without my name--and that this conduct of mine was a grave fraud
upon the people. The <i>Graphic</i> was not an authority upon any
subject whatever. It had a sort of distinction in that it was the
first and only illustrated daily newspaper that the world had
seen; but it was without character, it was poorly and cheaply
edited, its opinion of a book or of any other work of art was of
no consequence. Everybody knew this, yet all the critics in
America, one after the other, copied the <i>Graphic's</i>
criticism, merely changing the phraseology, and left me under
that charge of dishonest conduct. Even the great Chicago
<i>Tribune,</i> the most important journal in the Middle West,
was not able to invent anything fresh, but adopted the view of
the humble <i>Daily Graphic,</i> dishonesty charge and all.
However, let it go. It is the will of God that we must have
critics, and missionaries, and congressmen, and humorists, and we
must bear the burden.</p>

<p>What I have been traveling toward all this time is this: The
first critic that ever had occasion to describe my personal
appearance littered his description with foolish and inexcusable
errors whose aggregate furnished the result that I was distinctly
and distressingly unhandsome. That description floated around the
country in the papers, and was in constant use and wear for a
quarter of a century. It seems strange to me that apparently no
critic in the country could be found who could look at me and
have the courage to take up his pen and destroy that lie. That
lie began its course on the Pacific coast, in 1864, and it
likened me in personal appearance to Petroleum V. Nasby, who had
been out there lecturing. For twenty-five years afterward, no
critic could furnish a description of me without fetching in
Nasby to help out my portrait. I knew Nasby well, and he was a
good fellow, but in my life I have not felt malignantly enough
about any more than three persons to charge those persons with
resembling Nasby. It hurts me to the heart, these things. To this
day, it hurts me to the heart, and it had long been a distress to
my family--including Susy--that the critics should go on making
this wearisome mistake, year after year, when there was no
foundation for it. Even when a critic wanted to be particularly
friendly and complimentary to me, he didn't dare to go beyond my
clothes. He did not venture beyond that frontier. When he had
finished with my clothes he had said all the kind things, the
pleasant things, the complimentary things he could risk. Then he
dropped back on Nasby.</p>

<p>Yesterday I found this clipping in the pocket of one of those
ancient memorandum-books of mine. It is of the date of
thirty-nine years ago, and both the paper and the ink are yellow
with the bitterness that I felt in that old day when I clipped it
out to preserve it and brood over it and grieve about it. I will
copy it here, to wit:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A correspondent of the Philadelphia <i>Press</i>, writing of
one of Schuyler Colfax's receptions, says of our Washington
correspondent: "Mark Twain, the delicate humorist, was present;
quite a lion, as he deserves to be. Mark is a bachelor, faultless
in taste, whose snowy vest is suggestive of endless quarrels with
Washington washerwomen; but the heroism of Mark is settled for
all time, for such purity and smoothness were never seen before.
His lavender gloves might have been stolen from some Turkish
harem, so delicate were they in size; but more likely--anything
else were more likely than that. In form and feature he bears
some resemblance to the immortal Nasby; but whilst Petroleum is
brunette to the core, Twain is golden, amber-hued, melting,
blonde."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Let us return to Susy's biography now, and get the opinion of
one who is unbiased.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Papa's appearance has been described many times, but very
incorrectly. He has beautiful gray hair, not any too thick or any
too long, but just right; a Roman nose, which greatly improves
the beauty of his features; kind blue eyes and a small mustache.
He has a wonderfully shaped head and profile. He has a very good
figure--in short, he is an extrodinarily fine looking man. All
his features are perfect, exept that he hasn't extrodinary teeth.
His complexion is very fair, and he doesn't ware a beard. He is a
very good man and a very funny one. He <i>has</i> got a temper,
but we all of us have in this family. He is the loveliest man I
ever saw or ever hope to see--and oh, so absent-minded. He does
tell perfectly delightful stories. Clara and I used to sit on
each arm of his chair and listen while he told us stories about
the pictures on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I remember the story-telling days vividly. They were a
difficult and exacting audience--those little creatures.</p>

<p><i>New York, Thursday, February 8, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Susy Clemens's biography continued.--Romancer to the
children.--Incident of the spoon-shaped drive.--The burglar alarm
does its whole duty.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Along one side of the library, in the Hartford home, the
bookshelves joined the mantelpiece--in fact, there were shelves
on both sides of the mantelpiece. On these shelves, and on the
mantelpiece, stood various ornaments. At one end of the
procession was a framed oil-painting of a cat's head; at the
other end was a head of a beautiful young girl, life size, called
Emmeline, an impressionist water-color. Between the one picture
and the other there were twelve or fifteen of the
bric-&agrave;-brac things already mentioned, also an oil-painting
by Elihu Vedder, "The Young Medusa." Every now and then the
children required me to construct a romance--always
impromptu--not a moment's preparation permitted--and into that
romance I had to get all that bric-&agrave;-brac and the three
pictures. I had to start always with the cat and finish with
Ernmeline. I was never allowed the refreshment of a change, end
for end. It was not permissible to introduce a bric-&agrave;-brac
ornament into the story out of its place in the procession. These
bric-&agrave;-bracs were never allowed a peaceful day, a
reposeful day, a restful Sabbath. In their lives there was no
Sabbath. In their lives there was no peace. They knew no
existence but a monotonous career of violence and bloodshed. In
the course of time the bric-&agrave;-brac and the pictures showed
wear. It was because they had had so many and such violent
adventures in their romantic careers.</p>

<p>As romancer to the children I had a hard time, even from the
beginning. If they brought me a picture and required me to build
a story to it, they would cover the rest of the page with their
pudgy hands to keep me from stealing an idea from it. The stories
had to be absolutely original and fresh. Sometimes the children
furnished me simply a character or two, or a dozen, and required
me to start out at once on that slim basis and deliver those
characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of crime. If
they heard of a new trade, or an unfamiliar animal, or anything
like that, I was pretty sure to have to deal with those things in
the next romance. Once Clara required me to build a sudden tale
out of a plumber and a "bawgun stricter," and I had to do it. She
didn't know what a boa-constrictor was until he developed in the
tale---then she was better satisfied with it than ever.</p>

<h3>FROM SUSY'S BIOGRAPHY</h3>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Papa's favorite game is billiards, and when he is tired and
wishes to rest himself he stays up all night and plays billiards,
it seems to rest his head. He smokes a great deal almost
incessantly. He has the mind of an author exactly, some of the
simplest things he can't understand. Our burglar alarm is often
out of order, and papa had been obliged to take the mahogany room
off from the alarm altogether for a time, because the burglar
alarm had been in the habit of ringing even when the
mahogany-room window was closed. At length he thought that
perhaps the burglar alarm might be in order, and he decided to
try and see; accordingly he put it on and then went down and
opened the window; consequently the alarm bell rang, it would
even if the alarm had been in order. Papa went despairingly
upstairs and said to mamma, "Livy the mahogany room won't go on.
I have just opened the window to see."</p>

<p>"Why, Youth," mamma replied. "If you've opened the window, why
of course the alarm will ring!"</p>

<p>"That's what I've opened it for, why I just went down to see
if it would ring!"</p>

<p>Mamma tried to explain to papa that when he wanted to go and
see whether the alarm would ring while the window was closed he
<i>mustn't</i> go and open the window--but in vain, papa couldn't
understand, and got very impatient with mamma for trying to make
him believe an impossible thing true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>This is a frank biographer, and an honest one; she uses no
sandpaper on me. I have, to this day, the same dull head in the
matter of conundrums and perplexities which Susy had discovered
in those long-gone days. Complexities annoy me; then irritate me;
then this progressive feeling presently warms into anger. I
cannot get far in the reading of the commonest and simplest
contract--with its "parties of the first part," and "parties of
the second part," and "parties of the third part,"--my temper is
all gone.</p>

<p>In the days which Susy is talking about, a perplexity fell to
my lot one day. F. G. Whitmore was my business agent, and he
brought me out from town in his buggy. We drove by the
porte-coch&egrave;re and toward the stable. Now this was a
<i>single</i> road, and was like a spoon whose handle stretched
from the gate to a great round flower bed in the neighborhood of
the stable. At the approach to the flower bed the road divided
and circumnavigated it, making a loop, which I have likened to
the bowl of the spoon. I was sitting on the starboard side. As we
neared the loop, I sitting as I say, on the starboard side (and
that was the side on which the house was), I saw that Whitmore
was laying his course to port and was going to start around that
spoon bowl on that left-hand side. I said: "Don't do that,
Whitmore; take the right-hand side. Then I shall be next to the
house when we get to the door."</p>

<p>He said: "That will happen in any case. It doesn't make any
difference which way I go around this flower bed."</p>

<p>I explained to him that he was an ass, but he stuck to his
proposition, and I said, "Go on and try it, and see."</p>

<p>He went on and tried it, and sure enough he fetched me up at
the door on the side that he said I would be. I was not able to
believe it then, and I don't believe it yet. I said: "Whitmore,
that is merely an accident. You can't do it again." He said he
could--and we drove down into the street, fetched around, came
back--did it again. I was stupefied, paralyzed, petrified, with
these strange results, but they did not convince me. I didn't
believe he could do it another time, but he did. He said he could
do it all day and fetch up the same way every time--and by that
time my temper was gone, and I asked him to go home and apply to
the asylum and I would pay the expenses. I didn't want to see him
any more for a week. I went upstairs in a rage and started to
tell Livy about it, expecting to get her sympathy for me and to
breed aversion in her for Whitmore; but she merely burst into
peal after peal of laughter as the tale of my adventure went on,
for her head was like Susy's. Riddles and complexities had no
terrors for it. Her mind and Susy's were analytical. I have tried
to make it appear that mine was different. Many and many a time I
have told that buggy experiment, hoping against hope that I would
some time or other find somebody who would be on my side--but it
has never happened. And I am never able to go glibly forward and
state the circumstances of that buggy's progress without having
to halt and consider, and call up in my mind the spoon handle,
the bowl of the spoon, the buggy and the horse, and my position
in the buggy--and the minute I have got that far and try to turn
it to the left, it goes to ruin. I can't see how it is ever going
to fetch me out right when we get to the door. Susy is right in
her estimate. I can't understand things.</p>

<p>That burglar alarm which Susy mentions led a gay and careless
life, and had no principles. It was generally out of order at one
point or another, and there was plenty of opportunity, because
all the windows and doors in the house, from the cellar up to the
top floor, were connected with it. In its seasons of being out of
order it could trouble us for only a very little while. We
quickly found out that it was fooling us and that it was buzzing
its bloodcurdling alarm merely for its own amusement. Then we
would shut it off and send to New York for the electrician--there
not being one in all Hartford in those days. Then when the
repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and
reestablish our confidence in it. It never did any real business
except upon one single occasion. All the rest of its expensive
career was frivolous and without purpose. Just that one time it
performed its duty, and its whole duty--gravely, seriously,
admirably. It let fly about two o'clock one black and dreary
March morning, and I turned out promptly, because I knew that it
was not fooling, this time. The bathroom door was on my side of
the bed. I stepped in there, turned up the gas, looked at the
annunciator, turned off the alarm--so far as the door indicated
was concerned--thus stopping the racket. Then I came back to
bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clemens said, "What was it?"</p>

<p>I said, "It was the cellar door."</p>

<p>She said, "Was it a burglar, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "of course it was. Do you suppose it was a
Sunday-school superintendent?"</p>

<p>She said, "What do you suppose he wants?"</p>

<p>I said: "I suppose he wants jewelry, but he is not acquainted
with the house and he thinks it is in the cellar. I don't like to
disappoint a burglar whom I am not acquainted with and who has
done me no harm, but if he had had common sagacity enough to
inquire, I could have told him we kept nothing down there but
coal and vegetables. Still, it may be that he <i>is</i>
acquainted with this place and that what he really wants is coal
and vegetables. On the whole, I think it is vegetables he is
after."</p>

<p>She said, "Are you going down to see?"</p>

<p>"No," I said; "I could not be of any assistance. Let him
select for himself."</p>

<p>Then she said, "But suppose he comes up to the ground
floor!"</p>

<p>I said: "That's all right. We shall know it the minute he
opens a door on that floor. It will set off the alarm."</p>

<p>Just then the terrific buzzing broke out again. I said: "He
has arrived. I <i>told</i> you he would. I know all about
burglars and their ways. They are systematic people."</p>

<p>I went into the bathroom to see if I was right, and I was. I
shut off the dining-room and stopped the buzzing and came back to
bed. My wife said:</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he is after now?"</p>

<p>I said: "I think he has got all the vegetables he wants and is
coming up for napkin rings and odds and ends for the wife and the
children. They all have families--burglars have--and they are
always thoughtful of them; always take a few necessaries of life
for themselves, and the rest as tokens of remembrance for the
family. In taking them they do not forget us. Those very things
represent tokens of his remembrance of us also. We never get them
again. The memory of the attention remains embalmed in our
hearts."</p>

<p>She said. "Are you going down to see what it is he wants
now?"</p>

<p>'"No," I said; "I am no more interested than I was before.
These are experienced people. <i>They</i> know what they want. I
should be no help to him. I <i>think</i> he is after ceramics and
bric-&agrave;-brac and such things. If he knows the house he
knows that that is all that he can find on the dining-room
floor."</p>

<p>She said, "Suppose he comes up here!"</p>

<p>I said: "It is all right. He will give us notice."</p>

<p>She said, "What shall we do then?"</p>

<p>I said, "Climb out of the window."</p>

<p>She said, "Well, what is the use of a burglar alarm for
us?"</p>

<p>I said, "You have seen that it has been useful up to the
present moment, and I have explained to you how it will be
continuously useful after he gets up here."</p>

<p>That was the end of it. He didn't ring any more alarms.</p>

<p>Presently I said: "He is disappointed, I think. He has gone
off with the vegetables and the bric-&agrave;-brac and I think he
is dissatisfied."</p>

<p>We went to sleep, and at a quarter before eight in the morning
I was out, and hurrying, for I was to take the 8:29 train for New
York. I found the gas burning brightly--full head--all over the
first floor. My new overcoat was gone; my old umbrella was gone;
my new patent-leather shoes, which I had never worn, were gone.
The large window which opened into the ombra at the rear of the
house was standing wide. I passed out through it and tracked the
burglar down the hill through the trees; tracked him without
difficulty, because he had blazed his progress with
imitation-silver napkin rings and my umbrella, and various other
things which he had disapproved of; and I went back in triumph
and proved to my wife that he <i>was</i> a disappointed burglar.
I had suspected he would be, from the start, and from his not
coming up to our floor to get human beings.</p>

<p>Things happened to me that day in New York. I will tell about
them another time.</p>

<p><i>New York, Friday, February 9, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>The "strong language" episode in the bathroom. Susy's
reference to "The Prince and the Pauper."--The mother and the
children help edit the books.--Reference to ancestors.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Susy's remark about my strong language troubles me, and I must
go back to it. All through the first ten years of my married life
I kept a constant and discreet watch upon my tongue while in the
house, and went outside and to a distance when circumstances were
too much for me and I was obliged to seek relief. I prized my
wife's respect and approval above all the rest of the human
race's respect and approval. I dreaded the day when she should
discover that I was but a whited sepulcher partly freighted with
suppressed language, I was so careful, during ten years, that I
had not a doubt that my suppressions had been successful.
Therefore I was quite as happy in my guilt as I could have been
if I had been innocent.</p>

<p>But at last an accident exposed me. I went into the bathroom
one morning to make my toilet, and carelessly left the door two
or three inches ajar. It was the first time that I had ever
failed to take the precaution of closing it tightly. I knew the
necessity of being particular about this, because shaving was
always a trying ordeal for me, and I could seldom carry it
through to a finish without verbal helps. Now this time I was
unprotected, and did not suspect it. I had no extraordinary
trouble with my razor on this occasion, and was able to worry
through with mere mutterings and growlings of an improper sort,
but with nothing noisy or emphatic about them--no snapping and
barking. Then I put on a shirt. My shirts are an invention of my
own. They open in the back, and are buttoned there--when there
are buttons. This time the button was missing. My temper jumped
up several degrees in a moment and my remarks rose accordingly,
both in loudness and vigor of expression. But I was not troubled,
for the bathroom door was a solid one and I supposed it was
firmly closed. I flung up the window and threw the shirt out. It
fell upon the shrubbery where the people on their way to church
could admire it if they wanted to; there was merely fifty feet of
grass between the shirt and the passer-by. Still rumbling and
thundering distantly, I put on another shirt. Again the button
was absent. I augmented my language to meet the emergency and
threw that shirt out of the window. I was too angry--too
insane--to examine the third shirt, but put it furiously on.
Again the button was absent, and that shirt followed its comrades
out of the window. Then I straightened up, gathered my reserves,
and let myself go like a cavalry charge. In the midst of that
great assault, my eye fell upon that gaping door, and I was
paralyzed.</p>

<p>It took me a good while to finish my toilet. I extended the
time unnecessarily in trying to make up my mind as to what I
would best do in the circumstances. I tried to hope that Mrs.
Clemens was asleep, but I knew better. I could not escape by the
window. It was narrow and suited only to shirts. At last I made
up my mind to boldly loaf through the bedroom with the air of a
person who had not been doing anything. I made half the journey
successfully. I did not turn my eyes in her direction, because
that would not be safe. It is very difficult to look as if you
have not been doing anything when the facts are the other way,
and my confidence in my performance oozed steadily out of me as I
went along. I was aiming for the left-hand door because it was
farthest from my wife. It had never been opened from the day that
the house was built, but it seemed a blessed refuge for me now.
The bed was this one, wherein I am lying now and dictating these
histories morning after morning with so much serenity. It was
this same old elaborately carved black Venetian bedstead--the
most comfortable bedstead that ever was, with space enough in it
for a family, and carved angels enough surmounting its twisted
columns and its headboard and footboard to bring peace to the
sleepers, and pleasant dreams. I had to stop in the middle of the
room. I hadn't the strength to go on. I believed that I was under
accusing eyes--that even the carved angels were inspecting me
with an unfriendly gaze. You know how it is when you are
convinced that somebody behind you is looking steadily at you.
You <i>have</i> to turn your face--you can't help it. I turned
mine. The bed was placed as it is now, with the foot where the
head ought to be. If it had been placed as it should have been,
the high headboard would have sheltered me. But the footboard was
no sufficient protection and I could be seen over it. I was
exposed. I was wholly without protection. I turned, because I
couldn't help it--and my memory of what I saw is still vivid,
after all these years.</p>

<p>Against the white pillows I saw the black head--I saw that
young and beautiful face; and I saw the gracious eyes with a
something in them which I had never seen there before. They were
snapping and flashing with indignation. I felt myself crumbling;
I felt myself shrinking away to nothing under that accusing gaze.
I stood silent under that desolating fire for as much as a
minute, I should say--it seemed a very, very long time. Then my
wife's lips parted, and from them issued--<i>my latest bathroom
remark</i><i>.</i> The language perfect, but the expression
unpractical, apprentice-like, ignorant, inexperienced, comically
inadequate, absurdly weak and unsuited to the great language. In
my lifetime I had never heard anything so out of tune, so
inharmonious, so incongruous, so ill suited to each other as were
those mighty words set to that feeble music. I tried to keep from
laughing, for I was a guilty person in deep need of charity and
mercy. I tried to keep from bursting, and I succeeded--until she
gravely said, "There, now you know how it sounds."</p>

<p>Oh, then I exploded! I said, "Oh, Livy, if it sounds like
that, God forgive me, I will never do it again."</p>

<p>Then she had to laugh, herself. Both of us broke into
convulsions, and went on laughing until we were exhausted.</p>

<p>The children were present at breakfast--Clara, aged six, and
Susy, eight--and the mother made a guarded remark about strong
language; guarded because she did not wish the children to
suspect anything--a guarded remark which censured strong
language. Both children broke out in one voice with this comment,
"Why, mamma, papa uses it!" I was astonished. I had supposed that
that secret was safe in my own breast and that its presence had
never been suspected. I asked, "How did you know, you little
rascals?"</p>

<p>"Oh," they said, "we often listen over the balusters when you
are in the hall explaining things to George."</p>

<h3>FROM SUSY'S BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>One of papa's latest books is "The Prince and the Pauper" and
it is unquestionably the best book he has ever written, some
people want him to keep to his old style, some gentleman wrote
him, "I enjoyed Huckleberry Finn immensely and am glad to see
that you have returned to your old style." That enoyed me that
enoyed me greatly, because it trobles me [Susy was troubled by
that word, and uncertain; she wrote a <i>u</i> above it in the
proper place, but reconsidered the matter and struck it out] to
have so few people know papa, I mean realy know him, they think
of Mark Twain as a humorist joking at everything; "And with a mop
of reddish brown hair which sorely needs the barbars brush a
roman nose, short stubby mustache, a sad care-worn face, with
maney crow's feet," etc. That is the way people picture papa, I
have wanted papa to write a book that would reveal something of
his kind sympathetic nature, and "The Prince and the Pauper"
partly does it. The book is full of lovely charming ideas, and oh
the language! It is <i>perfect</i>. I think that one of the most
touching scenes in it, is where the pauper is riding horseback
with his nobles in the "recognition procession" and he sees his
mother oh and then what followed! How she runs to his side, when
she sees him throw up his hand palm outward, and is rudely pushed
off by one of the King's officers, and then how the little
pauper's consceince troubles him when he remembers the shameful
words that were falling from his lips, when she was turned from
his side "I know you not woman" and how his grandeurs were
stricken valueless, and his pride consumed to ashes. It is a
wonderfully beautiful and touching little scene, and papa has
described it so wonderfully. I never saw a man with <i>so</i>
much variety of feeling as papa has; now the "Prince and the
Pauper" is full of touching places, but there is most always a
streak of humor in them somewhere. Now in the coronation--in the
stirring coronation, just after the little king has got his crown
back again papa brings that in about the Seal, where the pauper
says he used the Seal "to crack nuts with." Oh it is so funny and
nice! Papa very seldom writes a passage without some humor in it
somewhere, and I dont think he ever will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The children always helped their mother to edit my books in
manuscript. She would sit on the porch at the farm and read
aloud, with her pencil in her hand, and the children would keep
an alert and suspicious eye upon her right along, for the belief
was well grounded in them that whenever she came across a
particularly satisfactory passage she would strike it out. Their
suspicions were well founded. The passages which were so
satisfactory to them always had an element of strength in them
which sorely needed modification or expurgation, and was always
sure to get it at their mother's hand.</p>

<p>For my own entertainment, and to enjoy the protests of the
children, I often abused my editor's innocent confidence. I often
interlarded remarks of a studied and felicitously atrocious
character purposely to achieve the children's delight and see the
pencil do its fatal work. I often joined my supplications to the
children's for mercy, and strung the argument out and pretended
to be in earnest. They were deceived, and so was their mother. It
was three against one, and most unfair. But it was very
delightful, and I could not resist the temptation. Now and then
we gained the victory and there was much rejoicing. Then I
privately struck the passage out myself. It had served its
purpose. It had furnished three of us with good entertainment,
and in being removed from the book by me it was only suffering
the fate originally intended for it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Without doubt it was I that gave Susy that impression. I
cannot imagine why, because I was never in my life much impressed
by grandeurs which proceed from the accident of birth. I did not
get this indifference from my mother. She was always strongly
interested in the ancestry of the house. She traced her own line
back to the Lambtons of Durham, England--a family which had been
occupying broad lands there since Saxon times. I am not sure, but
I think that those Lambtons got along without titles of nobility
for eight or nine hundred years, then produced a great man,
three-quarters of a century ago, and broke into the peerage. My
mother knew all about the Clemenses of Virginia, and loved to
aggrandize them to me, but she has long been dead. There has been
no one to keep those details fresh in my memory, and they have
grown dim.</p>

<p>Clara and I are sure that papa played the trick on Grandma,
about the whipping, that is related in "The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer": "Hand me that switch." The switch hovered in the air,
the peril was desperate--"My, look behind you Aunt!" The old lady
whirled around and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad
fled on the instant, scrambling up the high board fence and
disappeared over it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Susy and Clara were quite right about that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>These revelations and exposures are searching, but they are
just. If I am as transparent to other people as I was to Susy, I
have wasted much effort in this life.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grandma couldn't make papa go to school, so she let him go
into a printing-office to learn the trade. He did so, and
gradually picked up enough education to enable him to do about as
well as those who were more studious in early life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It is noticeable that Susy does not get overheated when she is
complimenting me, but maintains a proper judicial and
biographical calm. It is noticeable, also, and it is to her
credit as a biographer, that she distributes compliment and
criticism with a fair and even hand.</p>

<p>My mother had a good deal of trouble with me, but I think she
enjoyed it. She had none at all with my brother Henry, who was
two years younger than I, and I think that the unbroken monotony
of his goodness and truthfulness and obedience would have been a
burden to her but for the relief and variety which I furnished in
the other direction. I was a tonic. I was valuable to her. I
never thought of it before, but now I see it. I never knew Henry
to do a vicious thing toward me, or toward anyone else--but he
frequently did righteous ones that cost me as heavily. It was his
duty to report me, when I needed reporting and neglected to do it
myself, and he was very faithful in discharging that duty. He is
Sid in <i>Tom Sawyer.</i> But Sid was not Henry. Henry was a very
much finer and better boy than ever Sid was.</p>

<p>It was Henry who called my mother's attention to the fact that
the thread with which she had sewed my collar together to keep me
from going in swimming had changed color. My mother would not
have discovered it but for that, and she was manifestly piqued
when she recognized that that prominent bit of circumstantial
evidence had escaped her sharp eye. That detail probably added a
detail to my punishment. It is human. We generally visit our
shortcomings on somebody else when there is a possible excuse for
it--but no matter. I took it out of Henry. There is always
compensation for such as are unjustly used. I often took it out
of him--sometimes as an advance payment for something which I
hadn't yet done. These were occasions when the opportunity was
too strong a temptation, and I had to draw on the future. I did
not need to copy this idea from my mother, and probably didn't.
It is most likely that I invented it for myself. Still, she
wrought upon that principle upon occasion.</p>

<p>If the incident of the broken sugar bowl is in <i>Tom
Sawyer</i>--I don't remember whether it is or not--that is an
example of it. Henry never stole sugar. He took it openly from
the bowl. His mother knew he wouldn't take sugar when she wasn't
looking, but she had her doubts about me. Not exactly doubts,
either. She knew very well I <i>would</i><i>.</i> One day when
she was not present Henry took sugar from her prized and precious
old-English sugar bowl, which was an heirloom in the family--and
he managed to break the bowl. It was the first time I had ever
had a chance to tell anything on him, and I was inexpressibly
glad. I told him I was going to tell on him, but he was not
disturbed. When my mother came in and saw the bowl lying on the
floor in fragments, she was speechless for a minute. I allowed
that silence to work; I judged it would increase the effect. I
was waiting for her to ask, "Who did that?"--so that I could
fetch out my news. But it was an error of calculation. When she
got through with her silence she didn't ask anything about
it--she merely gave me a crack on the skull with her thimble that
I felt all the way down to my heels. Then I broke out with my
injured innocence, expecting to make her very sorry that she had
punished the wrong one. I expected her to do something remorseful
and pathetic. I told her that I was not the one--it was Henry.
But there was no upheaval. She said, without emotion: "It's all
right. It isn't any matter. You deserve it for something you've
done that I didn't know about; and if you haven't done it, why
then you deserve it for something that you are going to do that I
shan't hear about."</p>

<p>There was a stairway outside the house, which led up to the
rear part of the second story. One day Henry was sent on an
errand, and he took a tin bucket along. I knew he would have to
ascend those stairs, so I went up and locked the door on the
inside, and came down into the garden, which had been newly
plowed and was rich in choice, firm clods of black mold. I
gathered a generous equipment of these and ambushed him. I waited
till he had climbed the stairs and was near the landing and
couldn't escape. Then I bombarded him with clods, which he warded
off with his tin bucket the best he could, but without much
success, for I was a good marksman. The clods smashing against
the weather-boarding fetched my mother out to see what was the
matter, and I tried to explain that I was amusing Henry. Both of
them were after me in a minute, but I knew the way over that high
board fence and escaped for that time. After an hour or two, when
I ventured back, there was no one around and I thought the
incident was closed. But it was not so. Henry was ambushing me.
With an unusually competent aim for him, he landed a stone on the
side of my head which raised a bump there which felt like the
Matterhorn. I carried it to my mother straightway for sympathy,
but she was not strongly moved. It seemed to be her idea that
incidents like this would eventually reform me if I harvested
enough of them. So the matter was only educational. I had had a
sterner view of it than that before.</p>

<p>Whenever my conduct was of such exaggerated impropriety that
my mother's extemporary punishments were inadequate, she saved
the matter up for Sunday and made me go to church Sunday
night--which was a penalty sometimes bearable, perhaps, but as a
rule it was not, and I avoided it for the sake of my
constitution. She would never believe that I had been to church
until she had applied her test. She made me tell her what the
text was. That was a simple matter--caused me no trouble. I
didn't have to go to church to get a text. I selected one for
myself. This worked very well until one time when my text and the
one furnished by a neighbor, who had been to church, didn't
tally. After that my mother took other methods. I don't know what
they were now.</p>

<p>In those days men and boys wore rather long cloaks in the
wintertime. They were black, and were lined with very bright and
showy Scotch plaids. One winter's night when I was starting to
church to square a crime of some kind committed during the week.
I hid my cloak near the gate and went off and played with the
other boys until church was over. Then I returned home. But in
the dark I put the cloak on wrong side out, entered the room,
threw the cloak aside, and then stood the usual examination. I
got along very well until the temperature of the church was
mentioned. My mother said, "It must have been impossible to keep
warm there on such a night."</p>

<p>I didn't see the art of that remark, and was foolish enough to
explain that I wore my cloak all the time that I was in church.
She asked if I kept it on from church home, too. I didn't see the
bearing of that remark. I said that that was what I had done. She
said: "You wore it with that red Scotch plaid outside and
glaring? Didn't that attract any attention?"</p>

<p>Of course to continue such a dialogue would have been tedious
and unprofitable, and I let it go and took the consequences.</p>

<p>That was about 1849. Tom Nash was a boy of my own age--the
postmaster's son. The Mississippi was frozen across, and he and I
went skating one night, probably without permission. I cannot see
why we should go skating in the night unless without permission,
for there could be no considerable amusement to be gotten out of
skating at midnight if nobody was going to object to it. About
midnight, when we were more than half a mile out toward the
Illinois shore, we heard some ominous rumbling and grinding and
crashing going on between us and the home side of the river, and
we knew what it meant--the river was breaking up. We started for
home, pretty badly scared. We flew along at full speed whenever
the moonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell
which was ice and which was water. In the pauses we waited,
started again whenever there was a good bridge of ice, paused
again when we came to naked water, and waited in distress until a
floating vast cake should bridge that place. It took us an hour
to make the trip--a trip which we made in a misery of
apprehension all the time. But at last we arrived within a very
brief distance of the shore. We waited again. There was another
place that needed bridging. All about us the ice was plunging and
grinding along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore,
and the dangers were increasing, not diminishing. We grew very
impatient to get to solid ground, so we started too early and
went springing from cake to cake. Tom made a miscalculation and
fell short. He got a bitter bath, but he was so close to shore
that he only had to swim a stroke or two--then his feet struck
hard bottom and he crawled out. I arrived a little later, without
accident. We had been in a drenching perspiration and Tom's bath
was a disaster for him. He took to his bed, sick, and had a
procession of diseases. The closing one was scarlet fever, and he
came out of it stone deaf. Within a year or two speech departed,
of course. But some years later he was taught to talk, after a
fashion--one couldn't always make out what it was he was trying
to say. Of course he could not modulate his voice, since he
couldn't hear himself talk. When he supposed he was talking low
and confidentially, you could hear him in Illinois.</p>

<p>Four years ago (1902) I was invited by the University of
Missouri to come out there and receive the honorary degree of
LL.D. I took that opportunity to spend a week in Hannibal--a city
now, a village in my day. It had been fifty-five years since Tom
Nash and I had had that adventure. When I was at the railway
station ready to leave Hannibal, there was a great crowd of
citizens there. I saw Tom Nash approaching me across a vacant
space, and I walked toward him, for I recognized him at once. He
was old and white-headed, but the boy of fifteen was still
visible in him. He came up to me, made a trumpet of his hands at
my ear, nodded his head toward the citizens, and said,
confidentially--in a yell like a fog horn--"Same damned fools,
Sam."</p>

<p><i>Susy's biography continued.--Cadet of Temperance.--First
meeting of Mr. Clemens and Miss Langdon.--Miss Langdon an
invalid.--Doctor Newton.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I recall several of them without much difficulty. In Hannibal,
when I was about fifteen, I was for a short time a Cadet of
Temperance, an organization which probably covered the whole
United States during as much as a year--possibly even longer. It
consisted in a pledge to refrain, during membership, from the use
of tobacco; I mean it consisted partly in that pledge and partly
in a red merino sash, but the red merino sash was the main part.
The boys joined in order to be privileged to wear it--the pledge
part of the matter was of no consequence. It was so small in
importance that, contrasted with the sash, it was, in effect,
nonexistent. The organization was weak and impermanent because
there were not enough holidays to support it. We could turn out
and march and show the red sashes on May Day with the Sunday
schools, and on the Fourth of July with the Sunday schools, the
independent fire company, and the militia company. But you can't
keep a juvenile moral institution alive on two displays of its
sash per year. As a private, I could not have held out beyond one
procession, but I was Illustrious Grand Worthy Secretary and
Royal Inside Sentinel, and had the privilege of inventing the
passwords and of wearing a rosette on my sash. Under these
conditions, I was enabled to remain steadfast until I had
gathered the glory of two displays--May Day and the Fourth of
July. Then I resigned straightway, and straightway left the
lodge.</p>

<p>I had not smoked for three full months, and no words can
adequately describe the smoke appetite that was consuming me. I
had been a smoker from my ninth year--a private one during the
first two years, but a public one after that--that is to say,
after my father's death. I was smoking, and utterly happy, before
I was thirty steps from the lodge door. I do not now know what
the brand of the cigar was. It was probably not choice, or the
previous smoker would not have thrown it away so soon. But I
realized that it was the best cigar that was ever made. The
previous smoker would have thought the same if he had been
without a smoke for three months. I smoked that stub without
shame. I could not do it now without shame, because now I am more
refined than I was then. But I would smoke it, just the same. I
know myself, and I know the human race, well enough to know
that.</p>

<p>In those days the native cigar was so cheap that a person who
could afford anything could afford cigars. Mr. Garth had a great
tobacco factory, and he also had a small shop in the village for
the retail sale of his products. He had one brand of cigars which
even poverty itself was able to buy. He had had these in stock a
good many years, and although they looked well enough on the
outside, their insides had decayed to dust and would fly out like
a puff of vapor when they were broken in two. This brand was very
popular on account of its extreme cheapness. Mr. Garth had other
brands which were cheap, and some that were bad, but the
supremacy over them enjoyed by this brand was indicated by its
name. It was called "Garth's damnedest." We used to trade old
newspapers (exchanges) for that brand.</p>

<p>There was another shop in the village where the conditions
were friendly to penniless boys. It was kept by a lonely and
melancholy little hunchback, and we could always get a supply of
cigars by fetching a bucket of water for him from the village
pump, whether he needed water or not. One day we found him asleep
in his chair--a custom of his--and we waited patiently for him to
wake up, which was a custom of ours. But he slept so long, this
time, that at last our patience was exhausted and we tried to
wake him--but he was dead. I remember the shock of it yet.</p>

<p>In my early manhood, and in middle life, I used to vex myself
with reforms, every now and then. And I never had occasion to
regret these divergencies, for, whether the resulting
deprivations were long or short, the rewarding pleasure which I
got out of the vice when I returned to it always paid me for all
that it cost. However, I feel sure that I have written about
these experiments in the book called <i>Following the
Equator.</i> By and by I will look and see. Meantime, I will drop
the subject and go back to Susy's sketch of me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After papa had been a pilot on the Mississippi for a time,
Uncle Orion Clemens, his brother, was appointed Secretary of the
State of Nevada, and papa went with him out to Nevada to be his
secretary. Afterwards he became interested in mining in
California; then he reported for a newspaper and was on several
newspapers. Then he was sent to the Sandwich Islands. After that
he came back to America and his friends wanted him to lecture so
he lectured. Then he went abroad on the Quaker City, and on board
that ship he became equainted with Uncle Charlie (Mr. C. J.
Langdon, of Elmira, New York). Papa and Uncle Charlie soon became
friends, and when they returned from their journey Grandpa
Langdon, Uncle Charlie's father, told Uncle Charlie to invite Mr.
Clemens to dine with them at the St. Nicholas Hotel, in New York.
Papa accepted the invitation and went to dine at the St. Nicholas
with Grandpa and there he met mamma (Olivia Lewis Langdon) first.
But they did not meet again until the next August, because papa
went away to California, and there wrote "The Inocense
Abroad."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I will remark here that Susy is not quite correct as to that
next meeting. That first meeting was on the 27th of December,
1867, and the next one was at the house of Mrs. Berry, five days
later. Miss Langdon had gone there to help Mrs. Berry receive New
Year guests. I went there at ten in the morning to pay a New Year
call. I had thirty-four calls on my list, and this was the first
one. I continued it during thirteen hours, and put the other
thirty-three off till next year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mamma was the daughter of Mr. Jervis Langdon, (I don't know
whether Grandpa had a middle name or not) and Mrs. Olivia Lewis
Langdon, of Elmira, New York. She had one brother and one sister,
Uncle Charlie (Charles J. Langdon) and Aunt Susie (Susan Langdon
Crane). Mamma loved Grandpa more than any one else in the world.
He was her idol and she his; I think mamma's love for grandpa
must have very much resembled my love for mamma. Grandpa was a
great and good man and we all think of him with respect and love.
Mamma was an invalid when she was young, and had to give up study
a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>She became an invalid at sixteen, through a partial paralysis
caused by falling on the ice, and she was never strong again
while her life lasted. After that fall she was not able to leave
her bed during two years, nor was she able to lie in any position
except upon her back. All the great physicians were brought to
Elmira, one after another, during that time, but there was no
helpful result. In those days both worlds were well acquainted
with the name of Doctor Newton, a man who was regarded in both
worlds as a quack. He moved through the land in state; in
magnificence, like a portent; like a circus. Notice of his coming
was spread upon the dead walls in vast colored posters, along
with his formidable portrait, several weeks beforehand.</p>

<p>One day Andrew Langdon, a relative of the Langdon family, came
to the house and said: "You have tried everybody else; now try
Doctor Newton, the quack. He is downtown at the Rathburn House,
practicing upon the well-to-do at war prices and upon the poor
for nothing. <i>I saw him</i> wave his hands over Jake Brown's
head and take his crutches away from him and send him about his
business as good as new. <i>I saw him</i> do the like with some
other cripples. <i>They</i> may have been 'temporaries'
instituted for advertising purposes, and not genuine. But Jake is
genuine. Send for Newton."</p>

<p>Newton came. He found the young girl upon her back. Over her
was suspended a tackle from the ceiling. It had been there a long
time, but unused. It was put there in the hope that by its steady
motion she might be lifted to a sitting posture, at intervals,
for rest. But it proved a failure. Any attempt to raise her
brought nausea and exhaustion, and had to be relinquished. Newton
opened the windows--long darkened--and delivered a short fervent
prayer; then he put an arm behind her shoulders and said, "Now we
will sit up, my child."</p>

<p>The family were alarmed and tried to stop him, but he was not
disturbed, and raised her up. She sat several minutes, without
nausea or discomfort. Then Newton said, "Now we will walk a few
steps, my child." He took her out of bed and supported her while
she walked several steps; then he said: "I have reached the limit
of my art. She is not cured. It is not likely that she will
<i>ever</i> be cured. She will never be able to walk far, but
after a little daily practice she will be able to walk one or two
hundred yards, and she can depend on being able to do <i>that</i>
for the rest of her life."</p>

<p>His charge was fifteen hundred dollars, and it was easily
worth a hundred thousand. For from the day that she was eighteen
until she was fifty-six she was always able to walk a couple of
hundred yards without stopping to rest; and more than once I saw
her walk a quarter of a mile without serious fatigue.</p>

<p>Newton was mobbed in Dublin, in London, and in other places.
He was rather frequently mobbed in Europe and in America, but
never by the grateful Langdons and Clemenses. I met Newton once,
in after years, and asked him what his secret was. He said he
didn't know, but thought perhaps some subtle form of electricity
proceeded from his body and wrought the cures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon papa came back East and papa and mamma were married.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It sounds easy and swift and unobstructed, but that was not
the way of it. It did not happen in that smooth and comfortable
way. There was a deal of courtship. There were three or four
proposals of marriage and just as many declinations. I was roving
far and wide on the lecture beat, but I managed to arrive in
Elrnira every now and then and renew the siege. Once I dug an
invitation out of Charley Langdon to come and stay a week. It was
a pleasant week, but it had to come to an end. I was not able to
invent any way to get the invitation enlarged. No schemes that I
could contrive seemed likely to deceive. They did not even
deceive <i>me</i><i>,</i> and when a person cannot deceive
himself the chances are against his being able to deceive other
people. But at last help and good fortune came, and from a most
unexpected quarter. It was one of those cases so frequent in the
past centuries, so infrequent in our day--a case where the hand
of Providence is in it.</p>

<p>I was ready to leave for New York. A democrat wagon stood
outside the main gate with my trunk in it, and Barney, the
coachman, in the front seat with the reins in his hand. It was
eight or nine in the evening, and dark. I bade good-by to the
grouped family on the front porch, and Charley and I went out and
climbed into the wagon. We took our places back of the coachman
on the remaining seat, which was aft toward the end of the wagon,
and was only a temporary arrangement for our accommodation, and
was not fastened in its place; a fact which--most fortunately for
me, we were not aware of. Charley was smoking. Barney touched up
the horse with the whip. He made a sudden spring forward. Charley
and I went over the stern of the wagon backward. In the darkness
the red bud of fire on the end of his cigar described a curve
through the air which I can see yet. This was the only visible
thing in all that gloomy scenery. I struck exactly on the top of
my head and stood up that way for a moment, then crumbled down to
the earth unconscious. It was a very good unconsciousness for a
person who had not rehearsed the part. It was a cobblestone
gutter, and they had been repairing it. My head struck in a dish
formed by the conjunction of four cobblestones. That depression
was half full of fresh new sand, and this made a competent
cushion. My head did not touch any of those cobblestones. I got
not a bruise. I was not even jolted. Nothing was the matter with
me at all. Charley was considerably battered, but in his
solicitude for me he was substantially unaware of it. The whole
family swarmed out, Theodore Crane in the van with a flask of
brandy. He poured enough of it between my lips to strangle me and
make me bark, but it did not abate my unconsciousness. I was
taking care of that myself. It was very pleasant to hear the
pitying remarks trickling around over me. That was one of the
happiest half dozen moments of my life. There was nothing to mar
it--except that I had escaped damage. I was afraid that this
would be discovered sooner or later, and would shorten my visit.
I was such a dead weight that it required the combined strength
of Barney and Mr. Langdon, Theodore and Charley, to lug me into
the house, but it was accomplished. I was there. I recognized
that this was victory. I was there. I was safe to be an
incumbrance for an indefinite length of time--but for a length of
time, at any rate, and a Providence was in it. They set me up in
an armchair in the parlor and sent for the family physician. Poor
old creature, it was wrong to rout him out, but it was business,
and I was too unconscious to protest. Mrs. Crane--dear soul, she
was in this house three days ago, gray and beautiful, and as
sympathetic as ever--Mrs. Crane brought a bottle of some kind of
liquid fire whose function was to reduce contusions. But I knew
that mine would deride it and scoff at it. She poured this on my
head and pawed it around with her hand, stroking and massaging,
the fierce stuff dribbling down my backbone and marking its way,
inch by inch, with the sensation of a forest fire. But I was
satisfied. When she was getting worn out, her husband, Theodore,
suggested that she take a rest and let Livy carry on the
assuaging for a while. That was very pleasant. I should have been
obliged to recover presently if it hadn't been for that. But
under Livy's manipulations--if they had continued--I should
probably be unconscious to this day. It was very delightful,
those manipulations. So delightful, so comforting, so enchanting,
that they even soothed the fire out of that fiendish successor to
Perry Davis's "Pain-Killer."</p>

<p>Then that old family doctor arrived and went at the matter in
an educated and practical way--that is to say, he started a
search expedition for contusions and humps and bumps, and
announced that there were none. He said that if I would go to bed
and forget my adventure I would be all right in the
morning--which was not so. I was <i>not</i> all right in the
morning. I didn't intend to be all right, and I was far from
being all right. But I said I only needed rest and I didn't need
that doctor any more.</p>

<p>I got a good three days' extension out of that adventure, and
it helped a good deal. It pushed my suit forward several steps. A
subsequent visit completed the matter, and we became engaged
conditionally; the condition being that the parents should
consent.</p>

<p>In a private talk Mr. Langdon called my attention to something
I had already noticed--which was that I was an almost entirely
unknown person; that no one around about knew me except Charley,
and he was too young to be a reliable judge of men; that I was
from the other side of the continent, and that only those people
out there would be able to furnish me a character, in case I had
one--so he asked me for references. I furnished them, and he said
we would now suspend our industries and I could go away and wait
until he could write to those people and get answers.</p>

<p>In due course answers came. I was sent for and we had another
private conference. I had referred him to six prominent men,
among them two clergymen (these were all San Franciscans), and he
himself had written to a bank cashier who had in earlier years
been a Sunday-school superintendent in Elmira and well known to
Mr. Langdon. The results were not promising. All those men were
frank to a fault. They not only spoke in disapproval of me, but
they were quite unnecessarily and exaggeratedly enthusiastic
about it. One clergyman (Stebbins) and that ex-Sunday-school
superintendent (I wish I could recall his name) added to their
black testimony the conviction that I would fill a drunkard's
grave. It was just one of those usual long-distance prophecies.
There being no time limit, there is no telling how long you may
have to wait. I have waited until now, and the fulfillment seems
as far away as ever.</p>

<p>The reading of the letters being finished, there was a good
deal of a pause, and it consisted largely of sadness and
solemnity. I couldn't think of anything to say. Mr. Langdon was
apparently in the same condition. Finally he raised his handsome
head, fixed his clear and candid eye upon me, and said: "What
kind of people are these? Haven't you a friend in the world?"</p>

<p>I said, "Apparently not."</p>

<p>Then he said: "I'll be your friend, myself. Take the girl. I
know you better than they do."</p>

<p>Thus dramatically and happily was my fate settled. Afterward,
hearing me talking lovingly, admiringly, and fervently of Joe
Goodman, he asked me where Goodman lived. I told him out on the
Pacific coast. He said: "Why, he seems to be a friend of yours!
Is he?"</p>

<p>I said, "Indeed he is; the best one I ever had."</p>

<p>"Why, then," he said, "what could you have been thinking of?
Why didn't you refer me to him?"</p>

<p>I said: "Because he would have lied just as straightforwardly
on the other side. The others gave me all the vices; Goodman
would have given me all the virtues. You wanted unprejudiced
testimony, of course. I knew you wouldn't get it from Goodman. I
did believe you would get it from those others, and possibly you
did. But it was certainly less complimentary than I was
expecting."</p>

<p>The date of our engagement was February 4, 1869. The
engagement ring was plain, and of heavy gold. That date was
engraved inside of it. A year later I took it from her finger and
prepared it to do service as a wedding ring by having the wedding
date added and engraved inside of it--February 2, 1870. It was
never again removed from her finger for even a moment.</p>

<p>In Italy, a year and eight months ago, when death had restored
her vanished youth to her sweet face and she lay fair and
beautiful and looking as she had looked when she was girl and
bride, they were going to take that ring from her finger to keep
for the children. But I prevented that sacrilege. It is buried
with her.</p>

<p>In the beginning of our engagement the proofs of my first
book, <i>The Innocents Abroad,</i> began to arrive, and she read
them with me. She also edited them. She was my faithful,
judicious, and painstaking editor from that day forth until
within three or four months of her death--a stretch of more than
a third of a century.</p>

<p>Papa wrote mamma a great many beautiful love letters when he
was engaged to mamma, but mamma says I am too young to see them
yet; I asked papa what I should do for I didn't (know) how I
could write a Biography of him without his love letters, papa
said that I could write mamma's opinion of them, and that would
do just as well. So I'll do as papa says, and mamma says she
thinks they are the loveliest love letters that ever were
written, she says that Hawthorne's love letters to Mrs. Hawthorne
are far inferior to these. Mamma (and papa) were going to board
first in Bufalo and grandpa said he would find them a good
boarding-house. But he afterwards told mamma that he had bought a
pretty house for them, and had it all beautifully furnished, he
had also hired a young coachman, Patrick McAleer, and had bought
a horse for them, which all would be ready waiting for them, when
they should arive in Bufalo; but he wanted to keep it a secret
from "Youth," as grandpa called papa. What a delightful surprise
it was! Grandpa went down to Bufalo with mamma and papa. And when
they drove up to the house, papa said he thought the landlord of
such a boarding-house must charge a great deal to those who
wanted to live there. And when the secret was told papa was
delighted beyond all degree. Mamma has told me the story many
times, and I asked her what papa said when grandpa told him that
the delightful boarding-house was his home, mamma answered that
he was rather embariesed and so delighted he didn't know what to
say. About six months after papa and mamma were married grandpa
died; it was a terrible blow on mamma, and papa told Aunt Sue he
thought Livy would never smile again, she was so broken hearted.
Mamma couldn't have had a greater sorrow than that of dear
grandpa's death, or any that could equal it exept the death of
papa. Mamma helped take care of grandpa during his illness and
she couldn't give up hope till the end had realy

<p><small><sup>1</sup> August 6, 1870.--S. L. C.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Surely nothing is so astonishing, so unaccountable, as a
woman's endurance. Mrs. Clemens and I went down to Elmira about
the 1st of June to help in the nursing of Mr. Langdon. Mrs.
Clemens, her sister (Susy Crane), and I did all the nursing both
day and night, during two months until the end. Two months of
scorching, stifling heat. How much of the nursing did I do? My
main watch was from midnight till four in the morning--nearly
four hours. My other watch was a midday watch, and I think it was
only three hours. The two sisters divided the remaining seventeen
hours of the twenty-four between them, and each of them tried
generously and persistently to swindle the other out of a part of
her watch. The "on" watch could not be depended upon to call the
"off" watch--excepting when I was the "on" watch.</p>

<p>I went to bed early every night, and tried to get sleep enough
by midnight to fit me for my work, but it was always a failure. I
went on watch sleepy and remained miserably sleepy and wretched
straight along through the four hours. I can still see myself
sitting by that bed in the melancholy stillness of the sweltering
night, mechanically waving a palm-leaf fan over the drawn white
face of the patient; I can still recall my noddings, my fleeting
unconsciousnesses, when the fan would come to a standstill in my
hand and I would wake up with a start and a hideous shock. I can
recall all the torture of my efforts to keep awake; I can recall
the sense of the indolent march of time, and how the hands of the
tall clock seemed not to move at all, but to stand still. Through
the long vigil there was nothing to do but softly wave the
fan--and the gentleness and monotony of the movement itself
helped to make me sleepy. The malady was cancer of the stomach,
and not curable. There were no medicines to give. It was a case
of slow and steady perishing. At long intervals, the foam of
champagne was administered to the patient, but no other
nourishment, so far as I can remember.</p>

<p>A bird of a breed not of my acquaintance used to begin a sad
and wearisome and monotonous piping in the shrubbery near the
window a full hour before the dawn, every morning. He had no
company; he conducted this torture all alone, and added it to my
stock. He never stopped for a moment. I have experienced few
things that were more maddening than that bird's lamentings.
During all that dreary siege I began to watch for the dawn long
before it came; and I watched for it like the duplicate, I think,
of the lonely castaway on an island in the sea, who watches the
horizon for ships and rescue. When the first faint gray showed
through the window blinds I felt as no doubt that castaway feels
when the dim threads of the looked-for ship appear against the
sky.</p>

<p>I was well and strong, but I was a man and afflicted with a
man's infirmity--lack of endurance. But neither of those young
women was well nor strong: still, I never found either of them
sleepy or unalert when I came on watch; yet, as I have said, they
divided seventeen hours of watching between them in every
twenty-four. It is a marvelous thing. It filled me with wonder
and admiration; also with shame, for my dull incompetency. Of
course the physicians begged those daughters to permit the
employment of professional nurses, but they would not consent.
The mere mention of such a thing grieved them so that the matter
was soon dropped, and not again referred to.</p>

<p>All through her life Mrs. Clemens was physically feeble, but
her spirit was never weak. She lived upon it all her life, and it
was as effective as bodily strength could have been. When our
children were little she nursed them through long nights of
sickness, as she had nursed her father. I have seen her sit up
and hold a sick child upon her knees and croon to it and sway it
monotonously to and fro to comfort it, a whole night long,
without complaint or respite. But I could not keep awake ten
minutes at a time. My whole duty was to put wood on the fire. I
did it ten or twelve times during the night, but had to be called
every time, and was always asleep again before I finished the
operation, or immediately afterward.</p>

<p>No, there is nothing comparable to the endurance of a woman.
In military life she would tire out any army of men, either in
camp or on the march. I still remember with admiration that woman
who got into the overland stage-coach somewhere on the plains,
when my brother and I crossed the continent in the summer of
1861, and who sat bolt upright and cheerful, stage after stage,
and showed no wear and tear. In those days, the one event of the
day, in Carson City, was the arrival of the overland coach. All
the town was usually on hand to enjoy the event. The men would
climb down out of the coach doubled up with cramps, hardly able
to walk; their bodies worn, their spirits worn, their nerves raw,
their tempers at a devilish point; but the women stepped out
smiling and apparently unfatigued.</p>

<p>After grandpapa's death mamma and papa went back to Bufalo;
and three months afterward dear little Langdon was born. Mamma
named him Langdon after grandpapa, he was a wonderfully beautiful
little boy, but very, very delicate. He had wonderful blue eyes,
but such a blue that mamma has never been able to describe them
to me so that I could see them clearly in my mind's eye. His
delicate health was a constant anxiety to mamma, and he was so
good and sweet that that must have troubled her too, as I know it
did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Langdon was a little baby he used to carry a pencil in
his little hand, that was his great plaything; I believe he was
very seldom seen without one in his hand. When he was in Aunt
Susy's arms and would want to go to mamma he would hold out his
hands to her with the backs of his hands out toward her instead
of with his palmes out. (About a year and five months) after
Langdon was born I was born, and my chief occupation then was to
cry, so I must have added greatly to mamma's care. Soon after
little Langdon was born (a year) papa and mamma moved to Hartford
to live. Their house in Bufalo reminded them too much of dear
grandpapa, so they moved to Hartford soon after he died.</p>

<p>Soon after little Langdon was born a friend of mamma's came to
visit her (Emma Nigh)<sup>1</sup> and she was taken with the
typhoid fever, while visiting mamma. At length she became so
delirious, and so hard to take care of that mamma had to send to
some of her friends in Elmira to come and help take care of her.
Aunt Clara came, (Miss Clara L. Spaulding). She is no relation of
ours but we call her Aunt Clara because she is such a great
friend of mamma's. She came and helped mamma take care of Emma
Nigh, but in spite of all the good care that she received, she
grew worse and died.</p>

<p>Susy is right. Our year and a half in Buffalo had so saturated
us with horrors and distress that we became restless and wanted
to change, either to a place with pleasanter associations or with
none at all. In accordance with the hard terms of that fearful
law--the year of mourning--which deprives the mourner of the
society and comradeship of his race when he most needs it, we
shut ourselves up in the house and became recluses, visiting no
one and receiving visits from no one. There was one exception--a
single exception. David Gray--poet, and editor of the principal
newspaper--was our intimate friend, through his intimacy and mine
with John Hay. David had a young wife and a young baby. The Grays
and the Clemenses visited back and forth frequently, and this was
all the solace the Clemenses had in their captivity.</p>

<p>When we could endure imprisonment no longer, Mrs. Clemens sold
the house and I sold my one-third interest in the newspaper, and
we went to Hartford to live. I have some little business sense
now, acquired through hard experience and at great expense; but I
had none in those days. I had bought Mr. Kinney's share of that
newspaper (I think the name was Kinney) at his price--which was
twenty-five thousand dollars. Later I found that all that I had
bought of real value was the Associated Press privilege. I think
we did not make a very large use of that privilege. It runs in my
mind that about every night the Associated Press would offer us
five thousand words at the usual rate, and that we compromised on
five hundred. Still, that privilege was worth fifteen thousand
dollars, and was easily salable at that price. I sold my whole
share in the paper--including that solitary asset--for fifteen
thousand dollars. Kinney (if that was his name) was so delighted
at his smartness in selling a property to me for twenty-five
thousand that was not worth three-fourths of the money, that he
was not able to keep his joy to himself, but talked it around
pretty freely and made himself very happy over it. I could have
explained to him that what he mistook for his smartness was a
poor and driveling kind of thing. If there had been a triumph, if
there had been a mental exhibition of a majestic sort, it was not
his smartness; it was my stupidity; the credit was all due to me.
He was a brisk and ambitious and self-appreciative young fellow,
and he left straightway for New York and Wall Street, with his
head full of sordid and splendid dreams--dreams of the "get rich
quick" order; dreams to be realized through the dreamer's
smartness and the other party's stupidity. Kinney had no place in
Wall Street. He quickly lost the money he had gouged out of
it.</p>

<h3>MRS. MARY WILKES DEAD.</h3>
</center>

<center>
<p>FLORENCE, ITALY, Feb. 19.--Mrs. Mary Wilkes, widow of
Rear-Admiral Wilkes, U. S. N., is dead, aged eighty-five.</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It is death notices like this that enable me to realize in
some sort how long I have lived. They drive away the haze from my
life's road and give me glimpses of the beginning of it--glimpses
of things which seem incredibly remote.</p>

<p>When I was a boy of ten, in that village on the Mississippi
River which at that time was so incalculably far from any place
and is now so near to all places, the name of Wilkes, the
explorer, was in everybody's mouth, just as Roosevelt's is today.
What a noise it made, and how wonderful the glory! How far away
and how silent it is now! And the glory has faded to tradition.
Wilkes had discovered a new world and was another Columbus. That
world afterward turned mainly to ice and snow. But it was not
<i>all</i> ice and snow--and in our late day we are rediscovering
it, and the world's interest in it has revived. Wilkes was a
marvel in another way, for he had gone wandering about the globe
in his ships and had looked with his own eyes upon its furthest
corners, its dreamlands--names and places which existed rather as
shadows and rumors than as realities. But everybody visits those
places now, in outings and summer excursions, and no fame is to
be gotten out of it.</p>

<p>One of the last visits I made in Florence--this was two years
ago--was to Mrs. Wilkes. She had sent and asked me to come, and
it seemed a chapter out of the romantic and the impossible that I
should be looking upon the gentle face of the sharer in that
long-forgotten glory. We talked of the common things of the day,
but my mind was not present. It was wandering among the
snowstorms and the ice floes and the fogs and mysteries of the
antarctic with this patriarchal lady's young husband. Nothing
remarkable was said; nothing remarkable happened. Yet a visit has
seldom impressed me so much as did this one.</p>

<p align="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Here is a pleasant and welcome letter, which plunges me back
into the antiquities again:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>KNOLLWOOD,<br>
 WESTFIELD, NEW JERSEY.<br>
 <i>February 17, 1906.</i></p>

<p>MY DEAR MR. CLEMENS:</p>

<p>I should like to tell you how much I thank you for an article
which you wrote once, long ago, (1870 or '71) about my
grandfather, Anson Burlingame.</p>

<p>In looking over the interesting family papers and letters,
which have come into my possession this winter, nothing has
impressed me more deeply than your tribute. I have read it again
and again. I found it pasted into a scrapbook and apparently it
was cut from a newspaper. It is signed with your name.</p>

<p>It seems to bring before one more clearly, than anything I
have been told or read, my grandfather's personality and
achievements. . . .</p>

<p>Family traditions grow less and less in the telling. Young
children are so impatient of anecdotes, and when they grow old
enough to understand their value, frequent repetitions, as well
as newer interests and associations, seem to have dulled, not the
memory, but the spontaneity and joy of telling about the old
days--so unless there is something written and preserved, how
much is lost to children of the good deeds of their fathers.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will give you a little pleasure to know that after
all these years, the words you wrote about "a good man, and a
very, very great man" have fallen into the heart of one to whom
his fame is very near and precious. You say "Mr. Burlingame's
short history--for he was only forty-seven--reads like a
fairy-tale. Its successes, its surprises, its happy situations
occur all along, and each new episode is always an improvement
upon the one which went before it." That seems to have been very
true and it is interesting to hear, although it has the sad ring
of Destiny. But how shall I ever thank you for words like these?
"He was a true man, a just man, a generous man, in all his ways
and by all his instincts a noble man--a man of great brain, a
broad, and deep and mighty thinker. He was a great man, a very,
very great man. He was imperially endowed by nature, he was
faithfully befriended by circumstances, and he wrought gallantly
always in whatever station he found himself." How indeed shall I
thank you for these words or tell you how deeply they have
touched me, and how truly I shall endeavor to teach them to my
children.</p>

<p>That your fame may be as sacred as this, is my earnest,
grateful wish, not wholly the inevitable, imperishable fame that
is laid down for you, but the sweet and precious fame, to your
family and friends forever, of the fair attributes you ascribe to
my grandfather, which could never have been discerned by one who
was not like him in spirit.</p>

<p>With the hope some time of knowing you,</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>JEAN BURLINGAME BEATTY.</p>

<p>(Mrs. Robert Chetwood Beatty.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>This carries me back forty years, to my first meeting with
that wise and just and humane and charming man and great citizen
and diplomat, Anson Burlingame. It was in Honolulu. He had
arrived in his ship, on his way out on his great mission to
China, and I had the honor and profit of his society daily and
constantly during many days. He was a handsome and stately and
courtly and graceful creature, in the prime of his perfect
manhood, and it was a contenting pleasure to look at him. His
outlook upon the world and its affairs was as wide as the
horizon, and his speech was of a dignity and eloquence proper to
it. It dealt in no commonplaces, for he had no commonplace
thoughts. He was a kindly man, and most lovable. He was not a
petty politician, but a great and magnanimous statesman. He did
not serve his country alone, but China as well. He held the
balances even. He wrought for justice and humanity. All his ways
were clean; all his motives were high and fine.</p>

<p>He had beautiful eyes; deep eyes; speaking eyes; eyes that
were dreamy, in repose; eyes that could beam and persuade like a
lover's; eyes that could blast when his temper was up, I judge.
Preston S. Brooks, the congressional bully, found this out in his
day, no doubt. Brooks had bullied everybody, insulted everybody,
challenged everybody, cowed everybody, and was cock of the walk
in Washington. But when he challenged the new young Congressman
from the West he found a prompt and ardent man at last.
Burlingame chose rifles at short range, and Brooks apologized and
retired from his bullyship with the laughter of the nation
ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>When Mr. Burlingame arrived at Honolulu I had been confined to
my room a couple of weeks--by night to my bed, by day to a
splint-bottom chair, deep-sunk like a basket. There was another
chair, but I preferred this one, because my malady was saddle
boils.</p>

<p>When the boatload of skeletons arrived after forty-three days
in an open boat on ten days' provisions--survivors of the clipper
<i>Hornet,</i> which had perished by fire several thousand miles
away--it was necessary for me to interview them for the
Sacramento <i>Union,</i> a journal which I had been commissioned
to represent in the Sandwich Islands for a matter of five or six
months. Mr. Burlingame put me on a cot and had me carried to the
hospital, and during several hours he questioned the skeletons
and I set down the answers in my note-book. It took me all night
to write out my narrative of the <i>Hornet</i> disaster, and--but
I will go no further with the subject now. I have already told
the rest in some book of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Burlingame gave me some advice, one day, which I have
never forgotten, and which I have lived by for forty years. He
said, in substance:</p>

<p>"Avoid inferiors. Seek your comradeships among your superiors
in intellect and character; always <i>climb</i><i>."</i></p>

<p>Mr. Burlingame's son--now editor of <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>
these many years and soon to reach the foothills that lie near
the frontiers of age--was with him there in Honolulu; a handsome
boy of nineteen, and overflowing with animation, activity,
energy, and the pure joy of being alive. He attended balls and
fandangos and <i>hula hulas</i> every night--anybody's, brown,
half white, white--and he could dance all night and be as fresh
as ever the next afternoon. One day he delighted me with a joke
which I afterward used in a lecture in San Francisco, and from
there it traveled all around in the newspapers. He said, "If a
man compel thee to go with him a mile, go <i>with</i> him
Twain."</p>

<p>When it was new, it seemed exceedingly happy and bright, but
it has been emptied upon me upward of several million times
since--never by a witty and engaging lad like Burlingame, but
always by chuckle-heads of base degree, who did it with offensive
eagerness and with the conviction that they were the first in the
field. And so it has finally lost its sparkle and bravery, and is
become to me a seedy and repulsive tramp whose proper place is in
the hospital for the decayed, the friendless, and the
forlorn.</p>

<p><i>New York, Wednesday, February 21, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Langdon just escapes being a railway magnate.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>But I am wandering far from Susy's Biography. I remember that
I was about to explain a remark which I had been making about
Susy's grandfather Langdon having just barely escaped once the
good luck--or the bad luck--of becoming a great railway magnate.
The incident has interest for me for more than one reason. Its
details came to my knowledge in a chance way in a conversation
which I had with my father-in-law when I was arranging a contract
with my publisher for <i>Roughing It,</i> my second book. I told
him the publisher had arrived from Hartford, and would come to
the house in the afternoon to discuss the contract and complete
it with the signatures. I said I was going to require half the
profits over the essential costs of manufacture. He asked if that
arrangement would be perfectly fair to both parties, and said it
was neither good business nor good morals to make contracts which
gave to one side the advantage. I said that the terms which I was
proposing were fair to both parties. Then Mr. Langdon after a
musing silence said, with something like a reminiscent sorrow in
his tone, "When you and the publisher shall have gotten the
contract framed to suit you both and no doubts about it are left
in your minds, <i>sign</i> it--sign it: to-day, don't wait till
tomorrow."</p>

<p>It transpired that he had acquired this wisdom, which he was
giving me gratis, at considerable expense. He had acquired it
twenty years earlier, or thereabouts, at the Astor House in New
York, where he and a dozen other rising and able business men
were gathered together to secure a certain railroad which
promised to be a good property by and by, if properly developed
and wisely managed. This was the Lehigh Valley Railroad. There
were a number of conflicting interests to be reconciled before
the deal could be consummated. The men labored over these things
the whole afternoon, in a private parlor of that hotel. They
dined, then reassembled and continued their labors until after
two in the morning. Then they shook hands all around in great joy
and enthusiasm, for they had achieved success and had drawn a
contract in the rough which was ready for the signatures. The
signing was about to begin; one of the men sat at the table with
his pen poised over the fateful document, when somebody said:
"Oh, we are tired to death. There is no use in continuing this
torture any longer. Everything's satisfactory. Let's sign in the
morning." All assented, and that pen was laid aside.</p>

<p>Mr. Langdon said: "We got five or ten minutes' additional
sleep that night by that postponement, but it cost us several
millions apiece, and it was a fancy price to pay. If we had paid
out of our existing means, and the price had been a single
million apiece, we should have had to sit up, for there wasn't a
man among us who could have met the obligation completely. The
contract was never signed. We had traded a Bank of England for
ten minutes' extra sleep--a very small sleep, an apparently
unimportant sleep, but it has kept us tired ever since. When
you've got your contract right, this afternoon, sign it."</p>

<p>I followed that advice. It was thirty-five years ago, but it
has kept me tired ever since.</p>

<h3>FROM SUSY'S BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned that mamma and papa couldn't stay in their house
in Bufalo because it reminded them so much of grandpapa. Mamma
received a letter from Aunt Susy in which Aunt Susy says a good
deal about grandpapa, and the letter showed so clearly how much
every one that knew grandpapa loved and respected him, that mamma
let me take it to copy what is in it about grandpapa, and mamma
thought it would fit in nicely here.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>QUARRY FARM,<br>
 <i>April 16, '85</i></p>

<p>Livy dear, are you not reminded by to-day's report of General
Grant of father? You remember how as Judge Smith and others whom
father had chosen as executors were going out of the room, he
said "Gentlemen I shall live to bury you all"--smiled, and was
cheerful. At that time he had far less strength than General
Grant seems to have, but that same wonderful courage to battle
with the foe. All along there has been much to remind me of
father--of his quiet patience--in General Grant. There certainly
is a marked likeness in the souls of the two men. Watching, day
by day, the reports from the Nation's sick room brings to mind so
vividly the days of that summer of 1870. And yet they seem so far
away. I seemed as a child, compared with now, both in years and
experience. The best and the hardest of life have been since then
to me, and I know this is so in your life. All before seems
dreamy. I sepose this was because our lives had to be all
readjusted to go on without that great power in them. Father was
quietly such a power in so many lives beside ours, Livy dear--not
in kind or degree the same to any one but oh, a power!</p>

<p>The evening of the last company, I was so struck with the fact
that Mr. Atwater stood quietly before father's portrait a long
time and turning to me said, "We shall never see his like again,"
with a tremble and a choking in his voice--this after fifteen
years, and from a business friend. And some stranger, a week ago,
spoke of his habit of giving, as so remarkable, he having heard
of father's generosity. . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I remember Mr. Atwater very well. There was nothing citified
about him or his ways. He was in middle age, and had lived in the
country all his life. He had the farmer look, the farmer gait; he
wore the farmer clothes, and also the farmer goatee, a decoration
which had been universal when I was a boy. But was now become
extinct in some of the Western towns and in all of the Eastern
towns and cities. He was transparently a good and sincere and
honest man. He was a humble helper of Mr. Langdon, and had been
in his employ many years. His r&ocirc;le was general utility. If
Mr. Langdon's sawmills needed unscientific but plain common-sense
inspection, Atwater was sent on that service. If Mr. Langdon's
timber rafts got into trouble on account of a falling river or a
rising one, Atwater was sent to look after the matter. Atwater
went on modest errands to Mr. Langdon's coal mines; also to
examine and report upon Mr. Langdon's interests in the budding
coal-oil fields of Pennsylvania. Mr. Atwater was <i>always</i>
busy, always moving, always useful in humble ways, always
religious, and always ungrammatical, except when he had just
finished talking and had used up what he had in stock of that
kind of grammar. He was effective--that is, he was effective if
there was plenty of time. But he was constitutionally slow, and
as he had to discuss all his matters with whomsoever came along,
it sometimes happened that the occasion for his services had gone
by before he got them in. Mr. Langdon never would discharge
Atwater, though young Charley Langdon suggested that course now
and then. Young Charley could not <i>abide</i> Atwater, because
of his provoking dilatoriness and of his comfortable contentment
in it. But I loved Atwater. Atwater was a treasure to me. When he
would arrive from one of his inspection journeys and sit at the
table, at noon, and tell the family all about the campaign in
delicious detail, leaving out not a single inane,
inconsequential, and colorless incident of it, I heard it
gratefully; I enjoyed Mr. Langdon's placid patience with it; the
family's despondency and despair; and more than all these
pleasures together, the vindictiveness in young Charley's eyes
and the volcanic disturbances going on inside of him which I
could not see, but which I knew were there.</p>

<p>I am dwelling upon Atwater just for love. I have nothing
important to say about Atwater--in fact, only one thing to say
about him at all. And even that one thing I could leave
unmentioned if I wanted to--but I don't want to. It has been a
pleasant memory to me for a whole generation. It lets in a
fleeting ray of light upon Livy's gentle and calm and equable
spirit. Although she could feel strongly and utter her feelings
strongly, none but a person familiar with her and with all her
moods would ever be able to tell by her language that that
language was violent. Young Charley had many and many a time
tried to lodge a seed of unkindness against Atwater in Livy's
heart, but she was as steadfast in her fidelity as was her
father, and Charley's efforts always failed. Many and many a time
he brought to her a charge against Atwater which he believed
would bring the longed-for bitter word, and at last he scored a
success--for "all things come to him who waits."</p>

<p>I was away at the time, but Charley could not wait for me to
get back. He was too glad, too eager. He sat down at once and
wrote to me while his triumph was fresh and his happiness hot and
contenting. He told me how he had laid the whole exasperating
matter before Livy and then had asked her, <i>"Now</i> what do
you say?" And she said, <i>"Damn</i> Atwater."</p>

<p>Charley knew that there was no need to explain this to me. He
knew I would perfectly understand. He knew that I would know that
he was not quoting, but was <i>translating</i><i>.</i> He knew
that I would know that his translation was exact, was perfect,
that it conveyed the precise length, breadth, weight, meaning,
and force of the words which Livy had really used. He knew that I
would know that the phrase which she really uttered was, "I
disapprove of Atwater."</p>

<p>He was quite right. In her mouth that word "disapprove" was as
blighting and withering and devastating as another person's
damn.</p>

<p>One or two days ago I was talking about our sorrowful and
pathetic brief sojourn in Buffalo, where we became hermits, and
could have no human comradeship except that of young David Gray
and his young wife and their baby boy. It seems an <i>age</i>
ago. Last night I was at a large dinner party at Norman Hapgood's
palace uptown, and a very long and very slender gentleman was
introduced to me--a gentleman with a fine, alert, and
intellectual face, with a becoming gold <i>pince-nez</i> on his
nose and clothed in an evening costume which was perfect from the
broad spread of immaculate bosom to the rosetted slippers on his
feet. His gait, his bows, and his intonations were those of an
English gentleman, and I took him for an earl. I said I had not
understood his name, and asked him what it was. He said "David
Gray." The effect was startling. His very father stood before me,
as I had known him in Buffalo thirty-six years ago. This
apparition called up pleasant times in the beer mills of Buffalo
with David Gray and John Hay when this David Gray was in his
cradle, a beloved and troublesome possession. And this contact
kept me in Buffalo during the next hour, and made it difficult
for me to keep up my end of the conversation at my extremity of
the dinner table. The text of my reveries was: "What was he born
for? What was his father born for? What was I born for? What is
anybody born for?"</p>

<p>His father was a poet, but was doomed to grind out his living
in a most uncongenial occupation--the editing of a daily
political newspaper. He was a singing bird in a menagerie of
monkeys, macaws, and hyenas. His life was wasted. He had come
from Scotland when he was five years old; he had come saturated
to the bones with Presbyterianism of the bluest, the most
uncompromising and most unlovely shade. At thirty-three, when I
was comrading with him, his Presbyterianism was all gone and he
had become a frank rationalist and pronounced unbeliever. After a
few years news came to me in Hartford that he had had a
sunstroke. By and by the news came that his brain was affected,
as a result. After another considerable interval I heard, through
Ned House, who had been visiting him, that he was no longer able
to competently write either politics or poetry, and was living
quite privately and teaching a daily Bible class of young people,
and was interested in nothing else. His unbelief had passed away;
his early Presbyterianism had taken its place.</p>

<p>This was true. Some time after this I telegraphed and asked
him to meet me at the railway station. He came, and I had a few
minutes' talk with him--this for the last time. The same sweet
spirit of the earlier days looked out of his deep eyes. He was
the same David I had known before--great, and fine, and
blemishless in character, a creature to adore.</p>

<p>Not long afterward he was crushed and burned up in a railway
disaster, at night--and I probably thought then, as I was
thinking now, through the gay laughter-and-chatter fog of that
dinner table: "What was he born for? What was the use of it?"
These tiresome and monotonous repetitions of the human
life--where is their value? Susy asked that question when she was
a little child. There was nobody then who could answer it; there
is nobody yet.</p>

<p>When Mr. Langdon died, on the 6th of August, 1870, I found
myself suddenly introduced into what was to me a quite new
r&ocirc;le--that of business man, temporarily.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Friday, February 23, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens tells how he became a business man.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>During the previous year or year and a half, Mr. Langdon had
suffered some severe losses through a relative, an annex of the
family by marriage, who had paved Memphis, Tennessee, with the
wooden pavement so popular in that day. He had done this as Mr.
Langdon's agent. Well managed, the contract would have yielded a
sufficient profit, but through mismanagement it had merely
yielded a large loss. With Mr. Langdon alive, this loss was not a
matter of consequence and could not cripple the business. But
with Mr. Langdon's brain and hand and credit and high character
removed, it was another matter. He was a dealer in anthracite
coal. He sold this coal over a stretch of country extending as
far as Chicago, and he had important branches of his business in
a number of cities. His agents were usually considerably in debt
to him, and he was correspondingly in debt to the owners of the
mines. His death left three young men in charge of the
business--young Charley Langdon, Theodore Crane, and Mr. Slee. He
had recently made them partners in the business, by gift. But
they were unknown. The business world knew J. Langdon, a name
that was a power, but these three young men were ciphers without
a unit. Slee turned out afterward to be a very able man and a
most capable and persuasive negotiator, but at the time that I
speak of his qualities were quite unknown. Mr. Langdon had
trained him, and he was well equipped for his headship of the
little firm. Theodore Crane was competent in his line--that of
head clerk and superintendent of the subordinate clerks. No
better man could have been found for that place; but his
capacities were limited to that position. He was good and upright
and indestructibly honest and honorable, but he had neither
desire nor ambition to be anything above chief clerk. He was much
too timid for larger work or larger responsibilities. Young
Charley was twenty-one, and not any older than his age--that is
to say, he was a boy.</p>

<p>A careful statement of Mr. Langdon's affairs showed that the
assets were worth eight hundred thousand dollars, and that
against them was merely the ordinary obligations of the business.
Bills aggregating perhaps three hundred thousand
dollars--possibly four hundred thousand--would have to be paid;
half in about a month, the other half in about two months. The
collections to meet these obligations would come in further
along. With Mr. Langdon alive, these debts could be no
embarrassment. He could go to the bank in the town, or in New
York, and borrow the money without any trouble, but these boys
couldn't do that. They could get one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars cash, at once, but that was all. It was Mr. Langdon's
life insurance. It was paid promptly, but it could not go
far--that is it could not go far enough. It did not fall short
much--in fact, only fifty thousand dollars, but where to get the
fifty thousand dollars was a puzzle. They wrote to Mr. Henry W.
Sage, of Ithaca, an old and warm friend and former business
partner of Mr. Langdon, and begged him to come to Elmira and give
them advice and help. He replied that he would come. Then, to my
consternation, the young firm appointed <i>me</i> to do the
negotiating with him. It was like asking me to calculate an
eclipse. I had no idea of how to begin nor what to say. But they
brought the big balance sheet to the house and sat down with me
in the library and explained, and explained, and explained, until
at last I did get a fairly clear idea of what I must say to Mr.
Sage.</p>

<p>When Mr. Sage came he and I went to the library to examine
that balance sheet, and the firm waited and trembled in some
other part of the house. When I got through explaining the
situation to Mr. Sage I got struck by lightning again--that is to
say, he furnished me a fresh astonishment. He was a man with a
straight mouth and a wonderfully firm jaw. He was the kind of man
who puts his whole mind on a thing and keeps that kind of a mouth
shut and locked all the way through, while the other man states
the case. On this occasion I should have been grateful for some
slight indication from him, during my long explanation, which
might indicate that I was making at least some kind of an
impression upon him, favorable or unfavorable. But he kept my
heart on the strain all the way through, and I never could catch
any hint of what was passing through his mind. But at the finish
he spoke out with that robust decision which was a part of his
character and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Clemens, you've got as clear a business head on your
shoulders as I have come in contact with for years. What are you
an author for? You ought to be a business man."</p>

<p>I knew better, but it was not diplomatic to say so, and I
didn't. Then he said:</p>

<p>"All you boys need is my note for fifty thousand dollars, at
three months, handed in at the bank, and with that support you
will not need the money. If it shall be necessary to extend the
note, tell Mr. Arnot it will be extended. The business is all
right. Go ahead with it and have no fears. It is my opinion that
this note will come back to me without your having extracted a
dollar from it, at the end of the three months."</p>

<p>It happened just as he had said. Old Mr. Arnot, the Scotch
banker, a very rich and very careful man and life-long friend of
Mr. Langdon, watched the young firm and advised it out of his
rich store of commercial wisdom, and at the end of the three
months the firm was an established and growing concern, and the
note was sent back to Mr. Sage without our having needed to
extract anything from it. It was a small piece of paper,
insignificant in its dimensions, insignificant in the sum which
it represented, but formidable was its influence, and formidable
was its power, because of the man who stood behind it.</p>

<p>The Sages and the Twichells were very intimate. One or two
years later, Mr. Sage came to Hartford on a visit to Joe, and as
soon as he had gone away Twichell rushed over to our house, eager
to tell me something; something which had astonished him, and
which he believed would astonish me. He said:</p>

<p>"Why, Mark, you know, Mr. Sage, one of the best business men
in America, says that you have quite extraordinary business
talents."</p>

<p>Again I didn't deny it. I would not have had that superstition
dissipated for anything. It supplied a long-felt want. We are
always more anxious to be distinguished for a talent which we do
not possess than to be praised for the fifteen which we do
possess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Papa made arrangements to read at Vassar College the 1st of
May, and I went with him. We went by way of New York City. Mamma
went with us to New York and stayed two days to do some shopping.
We started Tuesday, at 1/2 past two o'clock in the afternoon, and
reached New York about 1/4 past six. Papa went right up to
General Grants from the station and mamma and I went to the
Everett House. Aunt Clara came to supper with us up in our
room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>This is the same Aunt Clara who has already been mentioned
several times. She had been my wife's playmate and schoolmate
from the earliest times, and she was about my wife's age, or two
or three years younger--mentally, morally, spiritually, and in
all ways, a superior and lovable personality.</p>

<p>Persons who think there is no such thing as luck--good or
bad--are entitled to their opinion. Clara Spaulding had the
average human being's luck in all things save one; she was
subject to ill luck with horses. It pursued her like a disease.
Every now and then a horse threw her. Every now and then carriage
horses ran away with her. At intervals omnibus horses ran away
with her. Usually there was but one person hurt, and she was
selected for that function. In Germany once our little family
started from the inn (in Worms, I think it was) to go to the
station. The vehicle of transportation was a great long omnibus
drawn by a battery of four great horses. Every seat in the bus
was occupied, and the aggregate of us amounted to a good two
dozen persons, possibly one or two more. I said playfully to
Clara Spaulding: "I think you ought to walk to the station. It
isn't right for you to imperil the lives of such a crowd of
inoffensive people as this." When we had gone a quarter of a mile
and were briskly approaching a stone bridge which had no
protecting railings, the battery broke and began to run. Outside
we saw the long reins dragging along the ground and a young
peasant racing after them and occasionally making a grab for
them. Presently he achieved success, and none too soon, for the
bus had already entered upon the bridge when he stopped the team.
The two dozen lives were saved. Nobody offered to take up a
collection, but I suggested to our friend and excursion
comrade--American consul at a German city--that we get out and
tip that young peasant. The consul said, with an enthusiasm
native to his character: "Stay right where you are. Leave me to
attend to that. His fine deed shall not go unrewarded." He jumped
out and arranged the matter, and we continued our journey.
Afterward I asked him what he gave the peasant, so that I could
pay my half. He told me, and I paid it. It is twenty-eight years
ago, yet from that day to this, although I have passed through
some stringent seasons, I have never seriously felt or regretted
that outlay. It was twenty-three cents.</p>

<p>Clara Spaulding, now Mrs. John B. Stanchfield, is in New York
at present, and I went to the Hoffman House yesterday to see her,
but it was as I was expecting: she is too ill to see any but
physicians and nurses. This illness has its source in a horseback
accident which fell to her share thirty years ago and which
resulted in broken bones of the foot and ankle. The broken bones
were badly set and she always walked with a limp afterward. Some
months ago the foot and ankle began to pain her unendurably and
it was decided that she must come to New York and have the bones
rebroken and reset. I saw her in the private hospital about three
weeks after that operation, and the verdict was that the
operation was successful. This turned out to be a mistake. She
came to New York a month or six weeks ago, and another rebreaking
and resetting was accomplished. A week ago, when I called, she
was able to hobble about the room by help of crutches, and she
was very happy in the conviction that now she was going to have
no more trouble. But it appears that this dreadful surgery-work
must be done over once more. But she is not fitted for it. The
pain is reducing her strength, and I was told that it has been
for the past three days necessary to exclude her from contact
with all but physicians and nurses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We and Aunt Clara were going to the theatre right after
supper, and we expected papa to take us there and to come home as
early as he could. But we got through dinner and he didn't come,
and didn't come, and mamma got more perplexed and worried, but at
last we thought we would have to go without him. So we put on our
things and started down stairs but before we'd goten half down we
met papa coming up with a great bunch of roses in his hand. He
explained that the reason he was so late was that his watch
stopped and he didn't notice and kept thinking it an hour earlier
than it really was. The roses he carried were some Col. Fred
Grant sent to mamma. We went to the theatre and enjoyed "Adonis"
[word illegible] acted very much. We reached home about 1/2 past
eleven o'clock and went right to bed. Wednesday morning we got up
rather late and had breakfast about 1/2 past nine o'clock. After
breakfast mamma went on shopping and papa and I went to see
papa's agent about some business matters. After papa had gotten
through talking to Cousin Charlie [Webster], papa's agent, we
went to get a friend of papa's, Major Pond, to go and see a Dog
Show with us. Then we went to see the dogs with Major Pond and we
had a delightful time seeing so many dogs together; when we got
through seeing the dogs papa thought he would go and see General
Grant and I went with him--this was April 29, 1885. Papa went up
into General Grant's room and he took me with him, I felt greatly
honored and delighted when papa took me into General Grant's room
and let me see the General and Col. Grant, for General Grant is a
man I shall be glad all my life that I have seen. Papa and
General Grant had a long talk together and papa has written an
account of his talk and visit with General Grant for me to put
into this biography.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Susy has inserted in this place that account of mine--as
follows:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>April 29, 1885</i></p>

<p>I called on General Grant and took Susy with me. The General
was looking and feeling far better than he had looked or felt for
some months. He had ventured to work again on his book that
morning--the first time he had done any work for perhaps a month.
This morning's work was his first attempt at dictating, and it
was a thorough success, to his great delight. He had always said
that it would be impossible for him to dictate anything, but I
had said that he was noted for clearness of statement, and as a
narrative was simply a statement of consecutive facts, he was
consequently peculiarly qualified and equipped for dictation.
This turned out to be true. For he had dictated two hours that
morning to a shorthand writer, had never hesitated for words, had
not repeated himself, and the manuscript when finished needed no
revision. The two hours' work was an account of Appomattox--and
this was such an extremely important feature that his book would
necessarily have been severely lame without it. Therefore I had
taken a shorthand writer there before, to see if I could not get
him to write at least a few lines about Appomattox.<sup>1</sup>
But he was at that time not well enough to undertake it. I was
aware that of all the hundred versions of Appomattox, not one was
really correct. Therefore I was extremely anxious that he should
leave behind him the truth. His throat was not distressing him,
and his voice was much better and stronger than usual. He was so
delighted to have gotten Appomattox accomplished once more in his
life--to have gotten the matter off his mind--that he was as
talkative as his old self. He received Susy very pleasantly, and
then fell to talking about certain matters which he hoped to be
able to dictate next day; and he said in substance that, among
other things, he wanted to settle once for all a question that
had been bandied about from mouth to mouth and from newspaper to
newspaper. That question was: "With whom originated the idea of
the march to the sea? Was it Grant's, or was it Sherman's idea?"
Whether I or some one else (being anxious to get the important
fact settled) asked him with whom the idea originated, I don't
remember. But I remember his answer. I shall always remember his
answer. General Grant said:</p>

<p>"Neither of us originated the idea of Sherman's march to the
sea. The enemy did it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> I was his publisher, I was putting his
<i>Personal Memoirs</i> to press at the time.--S. L.
C.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He went on to say that the enemy, however, necessarily
originated a great many of the plans that the general on the
opposite side gets the credit for; at the same time that the
enemy is doing that, he is laying open other moves which the
opposing general sees and takes advantage of. In this case,
Sherman had a plan all thought out, of course. He meant to
destroy the two remaining railroads in that part of the country,
and that would have finished up that region. But General Hood did
not play the military part that he was expected to play. On the
contrary, General Hood made a dive at Chattanooga. This left the
march to the sea open to Sherman, and so after sending part of
his army to defend and hold what he had acquired in the
Chattanooga region, he was perfectly free to proceed, with the
rest of it, through Georgia. He saw the opportunity, and he would
not have been fit for his place if he had not seized it.</p>

<p>"He wrote me" (the General is speaking) "what his plan was,
and I sent him word to go ahead. My staff were opposed to the
movement." (I think the General said they tried to persuade him
to stop Sherman. The chief of his staff, the General said, even
went so far as to go to Washington without the General's
knowledge and get the ear of the authorities, and he succeeded in
arousing their fears to such an extent that they telegraphed
General Grant to stop Sherman.)</p>

<p>Then General Grant said, "Out of deference to the government,
I telegraphed Sherman and stopped him twenty-four hours; and
then, considering that that was deference enough to the
government, I telegraphed him to go ahead again."</p>

<p>I have not tried to give the General's language, but only the
general idea of what he said. The thing that mainly struck me was
his terse remark that the enemy originated the idea of the march
to the sea. It struck me because it was so suggestive of the
General's epigrammatic fashion--saying a great deal in a single
crisp sentence. (This is my account, and signed Mark Twain.)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After papa and General Grant had had their talk, we went back
to the hotel where mamma was, and papa told mamma all about his
interview with General Grant. Mamma and I had a nice quiet
afternoon together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That pair of devoted comrades were <i>always</i> shutting
themselves up together when there was opportunity to have what
Susy called "a cozy time." From Susy's nursery days to the end of
her life, she and her mother were close friends, intimate
friends, passionate adorers of each other. Susy's was a beautiful
mind, and it made her an interesting comrade. And with the fine
mind she had a heart like her mother's. Susy never had an
interest or an occupation which she was not glad to put aside for
that something which was in all cases more precious to her--a
visit with her mother.</p>

<p>Susy died at the right time, the fortunate time of life, the
happy age--twenty-four years. At twenty-four, such a girl has
seen the best of life--life as a happy dream. After that age the
risks begin; responsibility comes, and with it the cares, the
sorrows, and the inevitable tragedy. For her mother's sake, I
would have brought her back from the grave if I could, but not
for my own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then papa went to read in public; there were a great many
authors that read, that Thursday afternoon, beside papa; I would
have liked to have gone and heard papa read, but papa said he was
going to read in Vassar just what he was planning to read in New
York, so I stayed at home with mamma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I think that that was the first exploitation of a new and
devilish invention--the thing called an Authors' Reading. This
witch's Sabbath took place in a theater, and began at two in the
afternoon. There were nine readers on the list, and I believe I
was the only one who was qualified by experience to go at the
matter in a sane way. I knew, by my old acquaintanceship with the
multiplication table, that nine times ten are ninety, and that
consequently the average of time allowed to each of these readers
should be restricted to ten minutes. There would be an
introducer, and he wouldn't understand his business--this
disastrous fact could be counted upon as a certainty. The
introducer would be ignorant, windy, eloquent, and willing to
hear himself talk. With nine introductions to make, added to his
own opening speech--well, I could not go on with these harrowing
calculations; I foresaw that there was trouble on hand. I had
asked for the sixth place in the list. When the curtain went up
and I saw that our half circle of minstrels were all on hand, I
made a change in my plan. I judged that in asking for sixth place
I had done all that was necessary to establish a fictitious
reputation for modesty, and that there could be nothing gained by
pushing this reputation to the limit; it had done its work and it
was time, now, to leave well enough alone, and do better. So I
asked to be moved up to third place, and my prayer was
granted.</p>

<p>The performance began at a quarter past two, and I, number
three in a list of ten (if we include the introducer), was not
called to the bat until a quarter after three. My reading was ten
minutes long. When I had selected it originally, it was twelve
minutes long, and it had taken me a good hour to find ways of
reducing it by two minutes without damaging it. I was through in
ten minutes. Then I retired to my seat to enjoy the agonies of
the audience. I did enjoy them for an hour or two; then all the
cruelty in my nature was exhausted and my native humanity came to
the front again. By half past five a third of the house was
asleep; another third were dying; and the rest were dead. I got
out the back way and went home.</p>

<p>During several years, after that, the Authors' Readings
continued. Every now and then we assembled in Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and scourged the people. It
was found impossible to teach the persons who managed these
orgies any sense. Also it was found impossible to teach the
readers any sense. Once I went to Boston to help in one of these
revels which had been instigated in the interest of a memorial to
Mr. Longfellow. Howells was always a member of these traveling
afflictions, and I was never able to teach him to rehearse his
proposed reading by the help of a watch and cut it down to a
proper length. He couldn't seem to learn it. He was a bright man
in all other ways, but whenever he came to select a reading for
one of these carousals his intellect decayed and fell to ruin. I
arrived at his house in Cambridge the night before the Longfellow
Memorial occasion, and I probably asked him to show me his
selection. At any rate, he showed it to me--and I wish I may
never attempt the truth again if it wasn't seven thousand words.
I made him set his eye on his watch and keep game while I should
read a paragraph of it. This experiment proved that it would take
me an hour and ten minutes to read the whole of it, and I said,
"And mind you, this is not allowing anything for such
interruptions as applause--for the reason that after the first
twelve minutes there wouldn't be any."</p>

<p>He had a time of it to find something short enough, and he
kept saying that he never would find a short enough selection
that would be good enough--that is to say, he never would be able
to find one that would stand exposure before an audience.</p>

<p>I said: "It's no matter. Better that than a long one--because
the audience could stand a bad short one, but couldn't stand a
good long one."</p>

<p>We got it arranged at last. We got him down to fifteen
minutes, perhaps. But he and Doctor Holmes and Aldrich and I had
the only short readings that day out of the most formidable
accumulation of authors that had ever thus far been placed in
position before the enemy--a battery of sixteen. I think that
that was the occasion when we had sixteen. It was in the
afternoon, and the place was packed, and the air would have been
very bad, only there wasn't any. I can see that mass of people
yet, opening and closing their mouths like fishes gasping for
breath. It was intolerable.</p>

<p>That graceful and competent speaker, Professor Norton, opened
the game with a very handsome speech, but it was a good twenty
minutes long. And a good ten minutes of it, I think, were devoted
to the introduction of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, who hadn't any
more need of an introduction than the Milky Way. Then Doctor
Holmes recited--as only Doctor Holmes could recite it--"The Last
Leaf," and the house rose as one individual and went mad with
worshiping delight. And the house stormed along, and stormed
along, and got another poem out of the Doctor as an encore; it
stormed again and got a third one--though the storm was not so
violent this time as had been the previous outbreaks. By this
time Doctor Holmes had, himself, lost a part of his mind, and he
actually went on reciting poem after poem until silence had taken
the place of encores and he had to do the last encore by
himself.</p>

<p>I had learned, by this time, to stipulate for third place on
the program. The performance began at two o'clock. My train for
Hartford would leave at four o'clock. I would need fifteen
minutes for transit to the station. I needed ten minutes for my
reading. I did my reading in the ten minutes; I fled at once from
the theater, and I came very near not catching that train. I was
told afterward that by the time reader number eight stepped
forward and trained his gun on the house, the audience were
drifting out of the place in groups, shoals, blocks, and
avalanches, and that about that time the siege was raised and the
conflict given up, with six or seven readers still to hear
from.</p>

<p>At the reading in Washington in the spring of '88 there was a
crowd of readers. They all came overloaded, as usual. Thomas
Nelson Page read forty minutes by the watch, and he was no
further down than the middle of the list. We were all due at the
White House at half past nine. The President and Mrs. Cleveland
were present, and at half past ten they had to go away--the
President to attend to some official business which had been
arranged to be considered after our White House reception, it
being supposed by Mr. Cleveland, who was inexperienced in
Authors' Readings, that our reception at the White House would be
over by half past eleven, whereas if he had known as much about
Authors' Readings as he knew about other-kinds of statesmanship,
he would have known that we were not likely to get through before
time for early breakfast.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I was always heedless. I was born heedless, and therefore I
was constantly, and quite unconsciously, committing breaches of
the minor proprieties, which brought upon me humiliations which
ought to have humiliated me, but didn't, because I didn't know
anything had happened. But Livy knew; and so the humiliations
fell to her share, poor child, who had not earned them and did
not deserve them. She always said I was the most difficult child
she had. She was very sensitive about me. It distressed her to
see me do heedless things which could bring me under criticism,
and so she was always watchful and alert to protect me from the
kind of transgressions which I have been speaking of.</p>

<p>When I was leaving Hartford for Washington, upon the occasion
referred to, she said: "I have written a small warning and put it
in a pocket of your dress vest. When you are dressing to go to
the Authors' Reception at the White House you will naturally put
your fingers in your vest pockets, according to your custom, and
you will find that little note there. Read it carefully and do as
it tells you. I cannot be with you, and so I delegate my sentry
duties to this little note. If I should give you the warning by
word of mouth, now, it would pass from your head and be forgotten
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>It was President Cleveland's first term. I had never seen his
wife--the young, the beautiful, the good-hearted, the
sympathetic, the fascinating. Sure enough, just as I had finished
dressing to go to the White House I found that little note, which
I had long ago forgotten. It was a grave little note, a serious
little note, like its writer, but it made me laugh. Livy's gentle
gravities often produced that effect upon me, where the expert
humorist's best joke would have failed, for I do not laugh
easily.</p>

<p>When we reached the White House and I was shaking hands with
the President, he started to say something, but I interrupted him
and said, "If Your Excellency will excuse me, I will come back in
a moment; but now I have a very important matter to attend to,
and it must be attended to at once." I turned to Mrs. Cleveland,
the young, the beautiful, the fascinating, and gave her my card,
on which I had written <i>"He did not"</i>--and I asked her to
sign her name below those words.</p>

<p>She said: "He did not? He did not what?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "never mind. We cannot stop to discuss that now.
This is urgent. Won't you please sign your name?" (I handed her a
fountain pen.)</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "I cannot commit myself in that way. Who is
it that didn't?--and what is it that he didn't?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "time is flying, flying, flying! Won't you take
me out of my distress and sign your name to it? It's all right. I
give you my word it's all right."</p>

<p>She looked nonplused, but hesitatingly and mechanically she
took the pen and said: "I will sign it. I will take the risk. But
you must tell me all about it, right afterward, so that you can
be arrested before you get out of the house in case there should
be anything criminal about this."</p>

<p>Then she signed; and I handed her Mrs. Clemens's note, which
was very brief, very simple, and to the point. It said, <i>"Don't
wear your arctics in the White House."</i> It made her shout; and
at my request she summoned a messenger and we sent that card at
once to the mail on its way to Mrs. Clemens in Hartford.</p>

<p>During 1893 and '94 we were living in Paris, the first half of
the time at the Hotel Brighton, in the rue de Rivoli, the other
half in a charming mansion in the rue de l'Universit&eacute;, on
the other side of the Seine, which, by good luck, we had gotten
hold of through another man's ill luck. This was Pomeroy, the
artist. Illness in his family had made it necessary for him to go
to the Riviera. He was paying thirty-six hundred dollars a year
for the house, but allowed us to have it at twenty-six hundred.
It was a lovely house; large, rambling, quaint, charmingly
furnished and decorated; built upon no particular plan;
delightfully rambling, uncertain, and full of surprises. You were
always getting lost in it, and finding nooks and corners and
rooms which you didn't know were there and whose presence you had
not suspected before. It was built by a rich French artist; and
he had also furnished it and decorated it himself. The studio was
coziness itself. We used it as drawing-room, sitting-room,
living-room, dancing-room--we used it for everything. We couldn't
get enough of it. It is odd that it should have been so cozy, for
it was forty feet long, forty feet high, and thirty feet wide,
with a vast fireplace on each side in the middle, and a
musicians' gallery at one end. But we had, before this, found out
that under the proper conditions spaciousness and coziness do go
together most affectionately and congruously. We had found it out
a year or two earlier, when we were living in the Villa Viviani
three miles outside the walls of Florence. That house had a room
in it which was forty feet square and forty feet high, and at
first we couldn't endure it. We called it the Mammoth Cave; we
called it the skating-rink; we called it the Great Sahara; we
called it all sorts of names intended to convey our disrespect.
We had to pass through it to get from one end of the house to the
other, but we passed straight through and did not loiter--and yet
before long, and without our knowing how it happened, we found
ourselves infesting that vast place day and night, and preferring
it to any other part of the house.</p>

<p>Four or five years ago, when we took a house on the banks of
the Hudson, at Riverdale, we drifted from room to room on our
tour of inspection, always with a growing doubt as to whether we
wanted that house or not. But at last when we arrived in a
dining-room that was sixty feet long, thirty feet wide, and had
two great fireplaces in it, that settled it.</p>

<p>But I have wandered. What I was proposing to talk about was
quite another matter--to wit: In that pleasant Paris house Mrs.
Clemens gathered little dinner companies together once or twice a
week, and it goes without saying that in these circumstances my
defects had a large chance for display. <i>Always</i><i>,</i>
always without fail, as soon as the guests were out of the house,
I saw that I had been miscarrying again. Mrs. Clemens explained
to me the various things which I had been doing and which should
have been left undone. The children had a name for this
performance. They called it "dusting off papa."</p>

<p>At last I had an inspiration. It is astonishing that it had
not occurred to me earlier. I said: "Why, livy, you know that
dusting me off <i>after</i> these dinners is not the wise way.
You could dust me off after every dinner for a year and I should
always be just as competent to do the forbidden thing at each
succeeding dinner as if you had not said a word, because in the
meantime I have forgotten all these instructions. I think the
correct way is for you to dust me off immediately before the
guests arrive, and then I can keep some of it in my head and
things will go better."</p>

<p>She recognized that that was wisdom and that it was a very
good idea. Then we set to work to arrange a system of signals to
be delivered by her to me during dinner; signals which would
indicate definitely which particular crime I was now engaged in,
so that I could change to another. The children got a screen
arranged so that they could be behind it during the dinner and
listen for the signals and entertain themselves with them. The
system of signals was very simple, but it was very effective. If
Mrs. Clemens happened to be so busy, at any time, talking with
her elbow neighbor that she overlooked something that I was
doing, she was sure to get a low-voiced hint from behind that
screen in these words:</p>

<p>"Blue card, mamma"; or, "Red card, mamma"--"Green card,
mamma"--so that I was under double and triple guard. What the
mother didn't notice the children detected for her.</p>

<p>As I say, the signals were quite simple, but very effective.
At a hint from behind the screen, Livy would look down the table
and say, in a voice full of interest, if not of counterfeited
apprehension, "What did you do with the blue card that was on the
dressing table--"</p>

<p>That was enough. I knew what was happening--that I was talking
the lady on my right to death and never paying any attention to
the one on my left. The blue card meant "Let the lady on your
right have a reprieve; destroy the one on your left"; so I would
at once go to talking vigorously to the lady on my left. It
wouldn't be long till there would be another hint, followed by a
remark from Mrs. Clemens which had in it an apparently casual
reference to a red card, which meant, "Oh, are you going to sit
there all the evening and never say anything? Do wake up and
talk." So I woke up and drowned the table with talk. We had a
number of cards, of different colors, each meaning a definite
thing, each calling attention to some crime or other in my common
list; and that system was exceedingly useful. It was entirely
successful. It was like Buck Fanshaw's riot. It broke up the riot
before it got a chance to begin. It headed off crime after crime
all through the dinner, and I always came out at the end
successful, triumphant, with large praises owing to me, and I got
them on the spot.</p>

<p>It is a far call back over the accumulation of years to that
night in the White House when Mrs. Cleveland signed the card.
Many things have happened since then. The Cleveland family have
been born since then. Ruth, the first-born, whom I never knew,
but with whom I corresponded when she was a baby, lived only a
few years.</p>

<p>To-day comes this letter, and it brings back the Clevelands,
and the past, and my lost little correspondent.</p>

<p>MY DEAR MR. CLEMENS:</p>

<p>President Finley and I are collecting letters to Ex-President
Cleveland from his friends, appropriate to his 69th birthday.</p>

<p>If the plan appeals to you, will you kindly send a sealed
greeting under cover to me at the above address, and I will send
it, and the other letters, South to him in time for him to get

<p>MR. SAMUEL L. CLEMENS.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When the little Ruth was about a year or a year and a half
old, Mason, an old and valued friend of mine, was consul-general
at Frankfort-on-the-Main. I had known him well in 1867, '68, and
'69, in America, and I and mine had spent a good deal of time
with him and his family in Frankfort in 1892-93. He was a
thoroughly competent, diligent, and conscientious official.
Indeed, he possessed these qualities in so large a degree that
among American consuls he might fairly be said to be monumental,
for at that time our consular service was largely--and I think I
may say mainly--in the hands of ignorant, vulgar, and incapable
men who had been political heelers in America, and had been taken
care of by transference to consulates, where they could be
supported at the government's expense instead of being
transferred to the poorhouse, which would have been cheaper and
more patriotic. Mason, in '78, had been consul-general in
Frankfort several years--four, I think. He had come from
Marseilles with a great record. He had been consul there during
thirteen years, and one part of his record was heroic. There had
been a desolating cholera epidemic, and Mason was the only
representative of any foreign country who stayed at his post and
saw it through. And during that time he not only represented his
own country, but he represented all the other countries in
Christendom and did their work, and did it well and was praised
for it in words of no uncertain sound. This great record of
Mason's had saved him from official decapitation straight along
while Republican Presidents occupied the chair, but now it was
occupied by a Democrat. Mr. Cleveland was not seated in it--he
was not yet inaugurated--before he was deluged with applications
from Democratic politicians desiring the appointment of a
thousand or so politically useful Democrats to Mason's place. A
year or two later Mason wrote me and asked me if I couldn't do
something to save him from destruction.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 6, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens makes Baby Ruth intercede in behalf of Mr.
Mason, and he is retained in his place.--Mr. Clemens's letter to
ex-President Cleveland.--Mr. Cleveland as sheriff, in
Buffalo.--As Mayor, he vetoes ordinance of railway
corporation.--Mr. Clemens and Mr. Cable visit Governor Cleveland
at Capitol, Albany.--Mr. Clemens sits on the bells and summons

<p> </p>

<p>I was very anxious to keep him in his place, but at first I
could not think of any way to help him, for I was a mugwump. We,
the mugwumps, a little company made up of the unenslaved of both
parties, the very best men to be found in the two great
parties--that was our idea of it--voted sixty thousand strong for
Mr. Cleveland in New York and elected him. Our principles were
high and very definite. We were not a party; we had no
candidates; we had no axes to grind. Our vote laid upon the man
we cast it for no obligation of any kind. By our rule we could
not ask for office; we could not accept office. When voting, it
was our duty to vote for the best man, regardless of his party
name. We had no other creed. Vote for the best man--that was
creed enough.</p>

<p>Such being my situation, I was puzzled to know how to try to
help Mason and at the same time save my mugwump purity undefiled.
It was a delicate place. But presently, out of the ruck of
confusions in my mind, rose a sane thought, clear and bright--to
wit: since it was a mugwump's duty to do his best to put the best
man in office, necessarily it must be a mugwump's duty to
<i>keep</i> the best man in when he was already there. My course
was easy now. It might not be quite delicate for a mugwump to
approach the President directly, but I could approach him
indirectly, with all delicacy, since in that case not even
courtesy would require him to take notice of an application which
no one could prove had ever reached him.</p>

<p>Yes, it was easy and simple sailing now. I could lay the
matter before Ruth, in her cradle, and wait for results. I wrote
the little child, and said to her all that I have just been
saying about mugwump principles and the limitations which they
put upon me. I explained that it would not be proper for me to
apply to her father in Mr. Mason's behalf, but I detailed to her
Mr. Mason's high and honorable record and suggested that she take
the matter in her own hands and do a patriotic work, which I felt
some delicacy about venturing upon myself. I asked her to forget
that her father was only President of the United States, and her
subject and servant: I asked her not to put her application in
the form of a command, but to modify this, and give it the
fictitious and pleasanter form of a mere request--that it would
be no harm to let him gratify himself with the superstition that
he was independent and could do as he pleased in the matter. I
begged her to put stress, and plenty of it, upon the proposition
that to keep Mason in his place would be a benefaction to the
nation; to enlarge upon that, and keep still about all other
considerations.</p>

<p>In due time I received a letter from the President, written
with his own hand, signed by his own hand, acknowledging Ruth's
intervention and thanking me for enabling him to save to the
country the services of so good and well tried a servant as
Mason, and thanking me, also, for the detailed fullness of
Mason's record, which could leave no doubt in anyone's mind that
Mason was in his right place and ought to be kept there.</p>

<p>In the beginning of Mr. Cleveland's second term a very strong
effort to displace Mason was made, and Mason wrote me again. He
was not hoping that we would succeed this time, because the
assault upon his place was well organized, determined, and
exceedingly powerful, but he hoped I would try again and see what
I could do. I was not disturbed. It seemed to me that he did not
know Mr. Cleveland or he would not be disturbed himself. I
believed I knew Mr. Cleveland, and that he was not the man to
budge an inch from his duty in any circumstances, and that he was
a Gibraltar against whose solid bulk a whole Atlantic of
assaulting politicians would dash itself in vain.</p>

<p>I wrote Ruth Cleveland once more. Mason remained in his place
and I think he would have remained in it without Ruth's
intercession. There have been other Presidents since, but Mason's
record has protected him, and the many and powerful efforts to
dislodge him have all failed. Also, he has been complimented with
promotions. He was promoted from consul-general in Frankfort to
consul-general at Berlin, our highest consular post in Germany. A
year ago he was promoted another step--to the consul-generalship
in Paris, and he holds that place yet.</p>

<p>Ruth, the child, remained not long on earth to help make it
beautiful and to bless the home of her parents. But, little
creature as she was, she did high service for her country, as I
have shown, and it is right that this should be recorded and
remembered.</p>

<p>In accordance with the suggestion made in Gilder's letter (as
copied in yesterday's talk) I have written the following note to
ex-President Cleveland:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>HONORED SIR:--</p>

<p>Your patriotic virtues have won for you the homage of half the
nation and the enmity of the other half. This places your
character as a citizen upon a summit as high as Washington's. The
verdict is unanimous and unassailable. The votes of both sides
are necessary in cases like these, and the votes of the one side
are quite as valuable as are the votes of the other. Where the
votes are all in a man's favor the verdict is against him. It is
sand, and history will wash it away. But the verdict for you is
rock, and will stand.</p>

<p>S. L. CLEMENS.</p>

<p><i>As of date March 18, 1906.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>When Mr. Cleveland was a member of a very strong and
prosperous firm of lawyers, in Buffalo, just before the
'seventies, he was elected to the mayoralty. Presently a
formidably rich and powerful railway corporation worked an
ordinance through the city government whose purpose was to take
possession of a certain section of the city inhabited altogether
by the poor, the helpless, and the inconsequential, and drive
those people out. Mr. Cleveland vetoed the ordinance. The other
members of his law firm were indignant and also terrified. To
them the thing which he had done meant disaster to their
business. They waited upon him and begged him to reconsider his
action. He declined to do it. They insisted. He still declined.
He said that his official position imposed upon him a duty which
he could not honorably avoid; therefore he should be loyal to it;
that the helpless situation of these inconsequential citizens
made it his duty to stand by them and be their friend, since they
had no other; that he was sorry if this conduct of his must bring
disaster upon the firm, but that he had no choice; his duty was
plain, and he would stick to the position which he had taken.
They intimated that this would lose him his place in the firm. He
said he did not wish to be a damage to the co-partnership,
therefore they could remove his name from it, and without any
hard feeling on his part.</p>

<p>During the time that we were living in Buffalo in '70 and '71,
Mr. Cleveland was sheriff, but I never happened to make his
acquaintance, or even see him. In fact, I suppose I was not even
aware of his existence. Fourteen years later, he was become the
greatest man in the state. I was not living in the state at the
time. He was Governor, and was about to step into the post of
President of the United States. At that time I was on the public
highway in company with another bandit, George W. Cable. We were
robbing the public with readings from our works during four
months--and in the course of time we went to Albany to levy
tribute, and I said, "We ought to go and pay our respects to the
Governor."</p>

<p>So Cable and I went to that majestic Capitol building and
stated our errand. We were shown into the Governor's private
office, and I saw Mr. Cleveland for the first time. We three
stood chatting together. I was born lazy, and I comforted myself
by turning the corner of a table into a sort of seat. Presently
the Governor said: "Mr. Clemens, I was a fellow citizen of yours
in Buffalo a good many months, a good while ago, and during those
months you burst suddenly into a mighty fame, out of a previous
long-continued and no doubt proper obscurity--but I was a nobody,
and you wouldn't notice me nor have anything to do with me. But
now that I have become somebody, you have changed your style, and
you come here to shake hands with me and be sociable. How do you
explain this kind of conduct?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "it is very simple. Your Excellency. In Buffalo
you were nothing but a sheriff. I was in society. I couldn't
afford to associate with sheriffs. But you are a Governor, now,
and you are on your way to the Presidency. It is a great
difference, and it makes you worth while."</p>

<p>There appeared to be about sixteen doors to that spacious
room. From each door a young man now emerged, and the sixteen
lined up and moved forward and stood in front of the Governor
with an aspect of respectful expectancy in their attitude. No one
spoke for a moment. Then the Governor said: "You are dismissed,
gentlemen. Your services are not required. Mr. Clemens is sitting
on the bells."</p>

<p>There was a cluster of sixteen bell-buttons on the corner of
the table against which I had been lounging,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next day mamma planned to take the four-o'clock car back
to Hartford. We rose quite early that morning and went to the
Vienna Bakery and took breakfast there. From there we went to a
German bookstore and bought some German books for Clara's
birthday.</p>

<p>Then mamma and I went to do some shopping and papa went to see
General Grant. After we had finnished doing our shopping we went
home to the hotel together. When we entered our rooms in the
hotel we saw on the table a vase full of exquisett red roses.
Mamma who is very fond of flowers exclaimed "Oh I wonder who
could have sent them." We both looked at the card in the midst of
the roses and saw that it was written on in papa's handwriting,
it was written in German. "Liebes Geshchenk on die Mamma." [I am
sure I didn't say "on"--that is Susy's spelling, not mine.--S. L.
C.] Mamma was delighted. Papa came home and gave mamma her
ticket; and after visiting a while with her went to see Major
Pond and mamma and I sat down to our lunch. After lunch most of
our time was taken up with packing, and at about three o'clock we
went to escort mamma to the train. We got on board the train with
her and stayed with her about five minutes and then we said
good-bye to her and the train started for Hartford. It was the
first time I had ever beene away from home without mamma in my
life, although I was 13 yrs. old. Papa and I drove back to the
hotel and got Major Pond and then went to see the Brooklyn Bridge
we went across it to Brooklyn on the cars and then walked back
across it from Brooklyn to New York. We enjoyed looking at the
beautiful scenery and we could see the bridge moove under the
intense heat of the sun. We had a perfectly delightful time, but
were pretty tired when we got back to the hotel.</p>

<p>The next morning we rose early, took our breakfast and took an
early train to Poughkeepsie. We had a very pleasant journey to
Poughkeepsie. The Hudson was magnificent--shrouded with beautiful
mist. When we arrived at Poughkeepsie it was raining quite hard;
which fact greatly dissapointed me because I very much wanted to
see the outside of the buildings of Vasser College and as it
rained that would be impossible. It was quite a long drive from
the station to Vasser College and papa and I had a nice long time
to discuss and laugh over German profanity. One of the German
phrases papa particularly enjoys is "O heilige maria Mutter
Jesus!" Jean has a German nurse, and this was one of her phrases,
there was a time when Jean exclaimed "Ach Gott!" to every trifle,
but when mamma found it out she was shocked and instantly put a
stop to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It brings that pretty little German creature vividly before
me--a sweet and innocent and plump little creature, with peachy
cheeks; a clear-souled little maiden and without offense,
notwithstanding her profanities, and she was loaded to the
eyebrows with them. She was a mere child. She was not fifteen
yet. She was just from Germany, and knew no English. She was
always scattering her profanities around, and they were such a
satisfaction to me that I never dreamed of such a thing as
modifying her. For my own sake, I had no disposition to tell on
her. Indeed, I took pains to keep her from being found out. I
told her to confine her religious expressions to the children's
quarters, and urged her to remember that Mrs. Clemens was
prejudiced against pieties on week days. To the children, the
little maid's profanities sounded natural and proper and right
because they had been used to that kind of talk in Germany, and
they attached no evil importance to it. It grieves me that I have
forgotten those vigorous remarks. I long hoarded them in my
memory as a treasure. But I remember one of them still, because I
heard it so many times. The trial of that little creature's life
was the children's hair. She would tug and strain with her comb,
accompanying her work with her misplaced pieties. And when
finally she was through with her triple job she always fired up
and exploded her thanks toward the sky, where they belonged, in
this form: "Gott sei Dank! Ich bin schon fertig mit'm Gott
verdammtes Haar!" (I believe I am not quite brave enough to
translate it.)</p>

<p>We at length reached Vasser College and she looked very
finely, her buildings and her grounds being very beautiful. We
went to the front doore and rang the bell. The young girl who
came to the doore wished to know who we wanted to see. Evidently
we were not expected. Papa told her who we wanted to see and she
showed us to the parlor. We waited, no one came; and waited, no
one came, still no one came. It was beginning to seem pretty
awkard, "Oh well this is a pretty piece of business," papa
exclaimed. At length we heard footsteps coming down the long
corridor and Miss C, (the lady who had invited papa) came into
the room. She greeted papa very pleasantly and they had a nice
little chatt together. Soon the lady principal also entered and
she was very pleasant and agreable. She showed us to our rooms
and said she would send for us when dinner was ready. We went
into our rooms, but we had nothing to do for half an hour exept
to watch the rain drops as they fell upon the window panes. At
last we were called to dinner, and I went down without papa as he
never eats anything in the middle of the day. I sat at the table
with the lady principal and enjoyed very much seing all the young
girls trooping into the dining-room. After dinner I went around
the College with the young ladies and papa stayed in his room and
smoked. When it was supper time papa went down and ate supper
with us and we had a very delightful supper. After supper the
young ladies went to their rooms to dress for the evening. Papa
went to his room and I went with the lady principal. At length
the guests began to arive, but papa still remained in his room
until called for. Papa read in the chapell. It was the first time
I had ever heard him read in my life--that is in public. When he
came out on the stage I remember the people behind me exclaimed
"Oh how queer he is! Isn't he funny!" I thought papa was very
funny, although I did not think him queer. He read "A Trying
Situation" and "The Golden Arm," a ghost story that he heard down
South when he was a little boy. "The Golden Arm" papa had told me
before, but he had startled me so that I did not much wish to
hear it again. But I had resolved this time to be prepared and
not to let myself be startled, but still papa did, and very very
much; he startled the whole roomful of people and they jumped as
one man. The other story was also very funny and interesting and
I enjoyed the evening inexpressibly much. After papa had finished
reading we all went down to the collation in the dining-room, and
after that there was dancing and singing. Then the guests went
away and papa and I went to bed. The next morning we rose early,
took an early train for Hartford and reached Hartford at 1/2 past
2 o'clock. We were very glad to get back.</p>

<p>How charitably she treats that ghastly experience! It is a
dear and lovely disposition, and a most valuable one, that can
brush away indignities and discourtesies and seek and find the
pleasanter features of an experience. Susy had that disposition,
and it was one of the jewels of her character that had come to
her straight from her mother. It is a feature that was left out
of me at birth. And at seventy I have not yet acquired it. I did
not go to Vassar College professionally, but as a guest--as a
guest, and gratis. Aunt Clara (Mrs. Stanchfield) was a graduate
of Vassar and it was to please her that I inflicted that journey
upon Susy and myself. The invitation had come to me from both the
lady mentioned by Susy and the president of the college--a sour
old saint who has probably been gathered to his fathers long ago;
and I hope they enjoy him; I hope they enjoy his society. I think
I can get along without it, in either end of the next world.</p>

<p>We arrived at the college in that soaking rain, and Susy has
described, with just a suggestion of dissatisfaction, the sort of
reception we got. Susy had to sit in her damp clothes half an
hour while we waited in the parlor; then she was taken to a
fireless room and left to wait there again, as she has stated. I
do not remember that president's name, and I am sorry. He did not
put in an appearance until it was time for me to step upon the
platform in front of that great garden of young and lovely
blossoms. He caught up with me and advanced upon the platform
with me and was going to introduce me. I said in substance, "You
have allowed me to get along without your help thus far, and if
you will retire from the platform I will try to do the rest
without it." I did not see him any more, but I detest his
memory.</p>

<p>Of course my resentment did not extend to the students, and so
I had an unforgettable good time talking to them. And I think
they had a good time, too, for they responded as one man, to use
Susy's unimprovable phrase.</p>

<p>Girls are charming creatures. I shall have to be twice seventy
years old before I change my mind as to that. I am to talk to a
crowd of them this afternoon, students of Barnard College (the
sex's annex to Columbia University), and I think I shall have
just as pleasant a time with those lassies as I had with the
Vassar girls twenty-one years ago.</p>

early life, he ran on steamboats on the Mississippi and the
Missouri rivers, in frequent contact with Samuel L. Clemens, and
tradition has it "Mark Twain" later used Tonkray as his model for
"Huckleberry Finn." He came to Murray in 1884 and had been living
a quiet life since.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I have replied that "Huckleberry Finn" was Tom Blankenship. As
this writer evidently knew the Hannibal of the 'forties, he will
easily recall Tom Blankenship. Tom's father was at one time Town
Drunkard, an exceedingly well-defined and unofficial office of
those days. He succeeded General---(I forget the General's
name)<sup>1</sup> and for a time he was sole and only incumbent
of the office; but afterward Jimmy Finn proved competency and
disputed the place with him, so we had two town drunkards at one
time--and it made as much trouble in that village as Christendom
experienced in the fourteenth century, when there were two Popes
at the same time.</p>

<p><sup> </sup></p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> Gaines.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>In <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> I have drawn Tom Blankenship
exactly as he was. He was ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed;
but he had as good a heart as ever any boy had. His liberties
were totally unrestricted. He was the only really independent
person--boy or man--in the community, and by consequence he was
tranquilly and continuously happy, and was envied by all the rest
of us. We liked him; we enjoyed his society. And as his society
was forbidden us by our parents, the prohibition trebled and
quadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his
society than of any other boy's. I heard, four years ago, that he
was justice of the peace in a remote village in Montana, and was
a good citizen and greatly respected.</p>

<p>During Jimmy Finn's term he was not exclusive; he was not
finical; he was not hypercritical; he was largely and handsomely
democratic--and slept in the deserted tanyard with the hogs. My
father tried to reform him once, but did not succeed. My father
was not a professional reformer. In him the spirit of reform was
spasmodic. It only broke out now and then, with considerable
intervals between. Once he tried to reform Injun Joe. That also
was a failure. It was a failure, and we boys were glad. For Injun
Joe, drunk, was interesting and a benefaction to us, but Injun
Joe, sober, was a dreary spectacle. We watched my father's
experiments upon him with a good deal of anxiety, but it came out
all right and we were satisfied. Injun Joe got drunk oftener than
before, and became intolerably interesting.</p>

<p>I think that in <i>Tom Sawyer</i> I starved Injun Joe to death
in the cave. But that may have been to meet the exigencies of
romantic literature. I can't remember now whether the real Injun
Joe died in the cave or out of it, but I do remember that the
news of his death reached me at a most unhappy time--that is to
say, just at bedtime on a summer night, when a prodigious storm
of thunder and lightning accompanied by a deluging rain that
turned the streets and lanes into rivers caused me to repent and
resolve to lead a better life. I can remember those awful
thunder-bursts and the white glare of the lightning yet, and the
wild lashing of the rain against the windowpanes. By my teachings
I perfectly well knew what all that wild rumpus was for--Satan
had come to get Injun Joe, I had no shadow of doubt about it. It
was the proper thing when a person like Injun Joe was required in
the under world, and I should have thought it strange and
unaccountable if Satan had come for him in a less spectacular
way. With every glare of lightning I shriveled and shrank
together in mortal terror, and in the interval of black darkness
that followed I poured out my lamentings over my lost condition,
and my supplications for just one more chance, with an energy and
feeling and sincerity quite foreign to my nature.</p>

<p>But in the morning I saw that it was a false alarm and
concluded to resume business at the old stand and wait for
another reminder.</p>

<p>The axiom says, "History repeats itself." A week or two ago my
nephew, by marriage, Edward Loomis, dined with us, along with his
wife, my niece <i>(n&eacute;e</i> Julie Langdon). He is
vice-president of the Delaware and Lackawanna Railway system. The
duties of his office used to carry him frequently to Elmira, New
York; the exigencies of his courtship carried him there still
oftener, and so in the course of time he came to know a good many
of the citizens of that place. At dinner he mentioned a
circumstance which flashed me back over about sixty years and
landed me in that little bedroom on that tempestuous night. He
said Mr. Buckly was sexton of the Episcopal church in Elmira, and
had been for many years the competent superintendent of all the
church's worldly affairs, and was regarded by the whole
congregation as a stay, a blessing, a priceless treasure. But he
had a couple of defects--not large defects, but they seemed large
when flung against the background of his profoundly religious
character: he drank a good deal, and he could outswear a
brakeman. A movement arose to persuade him to lay aside these
vices, and after consulting with his pal, who occupied the same
position as himself in the other Episcopal church, and whose
defects were duplicates of his own and had inspired regret in the
congregation whom he was serving, they concluded to try for
reform--not wholesale, but half at a time. They took the liquor
pledge and waited for results. During nine days the results were
entirely satisfactory, and they were recipients of many
compliments and much congratulation. Then on New Year's Eve they
had business a mile and a half out of town, just beyond the New
York State line. Everything went well with them that evening in
the barroom of the inn--but at last the celebration of the
occasion by those villagers came to be of a burdensome nature. It
was a bitter cold night and the multitudinous hot toddies that
were circulating began, by and by, to exert a powerful influence
upon the new prohibitionists. At last Buckly's friend remarked,
"Buckly, does it occur to you that we are outside the diocese?"
That ended reform No. 1.</p>

<p>Then they took a chance in reform No. 2. For a while that one
prospered and they got much applause.</p>

<p>One morning this stepnephew of mine, Loomis, met Buckly on the
street and said: "You have made a gallant struggle against those
defects of yours. I am aware that you failed on No. 1, but I am
also aware that you are having better luck with No. 2."</p>

<p>"Yes," Buckly said, "No. 2 is all right and sound up to date,
and we are full of hope."</p>

<p>Loomis said: "Buckly, of course you have your troubles like
other people, but they never show on the outside. I have never
seen you when you were not cheerful. Are you always cheerful?
Really always cheerful?"</p>

<p>"Well no," he said. "No, I can't say that I am always
cheerful, but--Well, you know that kind of a night that comes;
you wake up way in the night and the whole world is sunk in gloom
and there are storms and earthquakes and all sorts of disasters
in the air threatening and you get cold and chill; and when that
happens to me I recognize how sinful I am and it goes all clear
to my heart and wrings it and I have such terrors and
terrors--oh, they are indescribable, those terrors that assail
and thrill me, and I slip out of bed and get on my knees and pray
and pray and pray and promise that I will be good, etc. And then,
you know, in the morning the sun shines out so lovely and the
birds sing and the whole world is so beautiful, and--b' god! I
rally!"</p>

<p>Now I will quote a brief paragraph from this letter which I
have received from Mr. Tonkray. He says:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You no doubt are at a loss to know who I am. I will tell you.
In my younger days I was a resident of Hannibal, Mo., and you and
I were schoolmates attending Mr. Dawson's school along with Sam
and Will Bowen and Andy Fuqua and others whose names I have
forgotten. I was then about the smallest boy in school, for my
age, and they called me little Aleck Tonkray for short.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I don't remember Aleck Tonkray, but I knew those other people
as well as I knew the town drunkards. I remember Dawson's
schoolhouse perfectly. If I wanted to describe it I could save
myself the trouble by conveying the description of it to these
pages from <i>Tom Sawyer.</i> I can remember the drowsy and
inviting summer sounds that used to float in through the open
windows from that distant boy-Paradise, Cardiff Hill, and mingle
with the murmurs of the studying pupils and make them the more
dreary by the contrast. I remember Andy Fuqua, the oldest
pupil--a man of twenty-five. I remember the youngest pupil,
Nannie Owsley, a child of seven. I remember George RoBards,
eighteen or twenty years old, the only pupil who studied Latin. I
remember vaguely the rest of the twenty-five boys and girls. I
remember Mr. Dawson very well. I remember his boy, Theodore, who
was as good as he could be. In fact he was inordinately good,
extravagantly good, offensively good, detestably good--and he had
pop-eyes--and I would have drowned him if I had had a chance. In
that school we were all about on an equality, and, so far as I
remember, the passion of envy had no place in our hearts, except
in the case of Arch Fuqua--the other one's brother. Of course we
all went barefoot in the summertime. Arch Fuqua was about my own
age--ten or eleven. In the winter we could stand him, because he
wore shoes then, and his great gift was hidden from our sight and
we were enabled to forget it. But in the summertime he was a
bitterness to us. He was our envy, for he could double back his
big toe and let it fly and you could hear it snap thirty yards.
There was not another boy in the school that could approach this
feat. He had not a rival as regards a physical
distinction--except in Theodore Eddy, who could work his ears
like a horse. But he was no real rival, because you couldn't hear
him work his ears; so all the advantage lay with Arch Fuqua.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Friday, March 9, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens tells of several of his schoolmates in Mr.
Dawson's Hannibal school: George RoBards and Mary Moss; John
RoBards, who traveled far; John Garth and Helen Kercheval.--Mr.
Kercheval's slave woman and his apprentice saved Mr. Clemens from
drowning in Bear Creek.--Meredith, who became a guerrilla chief
in Civil War.--Will and Sam Bowen, Mississippi pilots--died of
yellow fever.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I am talking of a time sixty years ago and upward. I remember
the names of some of those schoolmates, and, by fitful glimpses,
even their faces rise before me for a moment--only just long
enough to be recognized; then they vanish. I catch glimpses of
George RoBards, the Latin pupil--slender, pale, studious, bending
over his book and absorbed in it, his long straight black hair
hanging down below his jaws like a pair of curtains on the sides
of his face. I can see him give his head a toss and flirt one of
the curtains back around his head--to get it out of his way,
apparently; really to show off. In that day it was a great thing
among the boys to have hair of so flexible a sort that it could
he flung back in that way, with a flirt of the head. George
RoBards was the envy of us all. For there was no hair among us
that was so competent for this exhibition as his. My hair was a
dense ruck of short curls, and so was my brother Henry's. We
tried all kinds of devices to get these crooks straightened out
so that they would flirt, but we never succeeded. Sometimes, by
soaking our heads and then combing and brushing our hair down
tight and flat to our skulls, we could get it straight,
temporarily, and this gave us a comforting moment of joy. But the
first time we gave it a flirt it all shriveled into curls again
and our happiness was gone.</p>

<p>George was a fine young fellow in all ways. He and Mary Moss
were sweethearts and pledged to eternal constancy, from a time
when they were merely children. But Mr. Lakenan arrived now and
became a resident. He took an important position in the little
town at once, and maintained it. He brought with him a
distinguished reputation as a lawyer. He was educated, cultured;
he was grave even to austerity; he was dignified in his
conversation and deportment. He was a rather oldish bachelor--as
bachelor oldishness was estimated in that day. He was a rising
man. He was contemplated with considerable awe by the community,
and as a catch he stood at the top of the market. That blooming
and beautiful thing, Mary Moss, attracted his favor. He laid
siege to her and won. Everybody said she accepted him to please
her parents, not herself. They were married. And everybody again,
testifying, said he continued her schooling all by himself,
proposing to educate her up to standard and make her a meet
companion for him. These things may have been true. They may not
have been true. But they were interesting. That is the main
requirement in a village like that. George went away, presently,
to some far-off region and there he died--of a broken heart,
everybody said. That could be true, for he had good cause. He
would go far before he would find another Mary Moss.</p>

<p>How long ago that little tragedy happened! None but the white
heads know about it now. Lakenan is dead these many years, but
Mary still lives, and is still beautiful, although she has
grandchildren. I saw her and one of her married daughters when I
went out to Missouri four years ago to receive an honorary LL.D.
from Missouri University.</p>

<p>John RoBards was the little brother of George, a wee chap with
silky golden curtains to his face which dangled to his shoulders
and below, and could be flung back ravishingly. When he was
twelve years old he crossed the plains with his father amid the
rush of the gold seekers of '49; and I remember the departure of
the cavalcade when it spurred westward. We were all there to see
and to envy. And I can still see that proud little chap sailing
by on a great horse, with his long locks streaming out behind. We
were all on hand to gaze and envy when he returned, two years
later, in unimaginable glory--for he had traveled. None of us had
ever been forty miles from home. But he had crossed the
continent. He had been in the gold mines, that fairyland of our
imagination. And he had done a still more wonderful thing. He had
been in ships--in ships on the actual ocean; in ships on three
actual oceans. For he had sailed down the Pacific and round the
Horn among icebergs and through snowstorms and wild wintry gales,
and had sailed on and turned the corner and flown northward in
the trades and up through the blistering equatorial waters--and
there in his brown face were the proofs of what he had been
through. We would have sold our souls to Satan for the privilege
of trading places with him.</p>

<p>I saw him when I was out on that Missouri trip four years ago.
He was old then--though not quite so old as I--and the burden of
life was upon him. He said his granddaughter, twelve years old,
had read my books and would like to see me. It was a pathetic
time, for she was a prisoner in her room and marked for death.
And John knew that she was passing swiftly away. Twelve years
old--just her grandfather's age when he rode away on that great
journey. In her I seemed to see that boy again. It was as if he
had come back out of that remote past and was present before me
in his golden youth. Her malady was heart disease, and her brief
life came to a close a few days later.</p>

<p>Another of those schoolboys was John Garth. And one of the
prettiest of the schoolgirls was Helen Kercheval. They grew up
and married. He became a prosperous banker and a prominent and
valued citizen; and a few years ago he died, rich and honored.
<i>He died</i><i>.</i> It is what I have to say about so many of
those boys and girls. The widow still lives, and there are
grandchildren, I saw John's tomb when I made that Missouri
visit.</p>

<p>Mr. Kercheval had an apprentice in the early days when I was
nine years old, and he had also a slave woman who had many
merits. But I can't feel either very kindly or forgivingly toward
either that good apprentice boy or that good slave woman, for
they saved my life. One day when I was playing on a loose log
which I supposed was attached to a raft--but it wasn't--it tilted
me into Bear Creek. And when I had been under water twice and was
coming up to make the third and fatal descent, my fingers
appeared above the water and that slave woman seized them and
pulled me out. Within a week I was in again, and that apprentice
had to come along just at the wrong time, and he plunged in and
dived, pawed around on the bottom and found me, and dragged me
out, emptied the water out of me, and I was saved again. I was
drowned seven times after that before I learned to swim--once in
Bear Creek and six times in the Mississippi. I do not now know
who the people were who interfered with the intentions of a
Providence wiser than themselves, but I hold a grudge against
them yet.</p>

<p>Another schoolmate was John Meredith, a boy of a quite
uncommonly sweet and gentle disposition. He grew up, and when the
Civil War broke out he became a sort of guerrilla chief on the
Confederate side, and I was told that in his raids upon Union
families in the country parts of Monroe County--in earlier times
the friends and familiars of his father--he was remorseless in
his devastations and sheddings of blood. It seems almost
incredible that this could have been that gentle comrade of my
school days; yet it can be true, for Robespierre when he was
young was like that. John has been in his grave many and many a
year.</p>

<p>Will Bowen was another schoolmate, and so was his brother,
Sam, who was his junior by a couple of years. Before the Civil
War broke out both became St. Louis and New Orleans pilots. While
Sam was still very young he had a curious adventure. He fell in
love with a girl of sixteen, only child of a very wealthy German
brewer. He wanted to marry her, but he and she both thought that
the papa would not only not consent, but would shut his door
against Sam. The old man was not so disposed, but they were not
aware of that. He had his eye upon them, and it was not a hostile
eye. That indiscreet young couple got to living together
surreptitiously. Before long the old man died. When the will was
examined it was found that he had left the whole of his wealth to
Mrs. Samuel A. Bowen. Then the poor things made another mistake.
They rushed down to the French suburb, Carondelet, and got a
magistrate to marry them and date the marriage back a few months.
The old brewer had some nieces and nephews and cousins, and
different kinds of assets of that sort, and they traced out the
fraud and proved it and got the property. This left Sam with a
girl wife on his hands and the necessity of earning a living for
her at the pilot wheel. After a few years Sam and another pilot
were bringing a boat up from New Orleans when the yellow fever
broke out among the few passengers and the crew. Both pilots were
stricken with it and there was nobody to take their place at the
wheel. The boat was landed at the head of Island 82 to wait for
succor. Death came swiftly to both pilots--and there they lie
buried, unless the river has cut the graves away and washed the
bones into the stream, a thing which has probably happened long
ago.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 12, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens comments on the killing of six hundred
Moros--men, women and children--in a crater bowl near Jolo in the
Philippines--our troops commanded by General Wood.--Contrasts
this "battle" with various other details of our military
history.--The newspapers' attitude toward the announcements.--The
President's message of congratulation.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>We will stop talking about my schoolmates of sixty years ago,
for the present, and return to them later. They strongly interest
me, and I am not going to leave them alone permanently. Strong as
that interest is, it is for the moment pushed out of the way by
an incident of to-day, which is still stronger. This incident
burst upon the world last Friday in an official cablegram from
the commander of our forces in the Philippines to our government
at Washington. The substance of it was as follows:</p>

<p>A tribe of Moros, dark-skinned savages, had fortified
themselves in the bowl of an extinct crater not many miles from
Jolo; and as they were hostiles, and bitter against us because we
have been trying for eight years to take their liberties away
from them, their presence in that position was a menace. Our
commander, Gen. Leonard Wood, ordered a reconnaissance. It was
found that the Moros numbered six hundred, counting women and
children; that their crater bowl was in the summit of a peak or
mountain twenty-two hundred feet above sea level, and very
difficult of access for Christian troops and artillery. Then
General Wood ordered a surprise, and went along himself to see
the order carried out. Our troops climbed the heights by devious
and difficult trails, and even took some artillery with them. The
kind of artillery is not specified, but in one place it was
hoisted up a sharp acclivity by tackle a distance of some three
hundred feet. Arrived at the rim of the crater, the battle began.
Our soldiers numbered five hundred and forty. They were assisted
by auxiliaries consisting of a detachment of native constabulary
in our pay--their numbers not given--and by a naval detachment,
whose numbers are not stated. But apparently the contending
parties were about equal as to number--six hundred men on our
side, on the edge of the bowl; six hundred men, women, and
children in the bottom of the bowl. Depth of the bowl, 50
feet.</p>

<p>General Wood's order was, "Kill or capture the six
hundred."</p>

<p>The battle began--it is officially called by that name--our
forces firing down into the crater with their artillery and their
deadly small arms of precision; the savages furiously returning
the fire, probably with brickbats--though this is merely a
surmise of mine, as the weapons used by the savages are not
nominated in the cablegram. Heretofore the Moros have used knives
and clubs mainly; also ineffectual trade-muskets when they had
any.</p>

<p>The official report stated that the battle was fought with
prodigious energy on both sides during a day and a half, and that
it ended with a complete victory for the American arms. The
completeness of the victory is established by this fact: that of
the six hundred Moros not one was left alive. The brilliancy of
the victory is established by this other fact, to wit: that of
our six hundred heroes only fifteen lost their lives.</p>

<p>General Wood was present and looking on. His order had been,
"Kill <i>or</i> capture those savages." Apparently our little
army considered that the "or" left them authorized to kill
<i>or</i> capture according to taste, and that their taste had
remained what it has been for eight years, in our army out
there--the taste of Christian butchers.</p>

<p>The official report quite properly extolled and magnified the
"heroism" and "gallantry" of our troops, lamented the loss of the
fifteen who perished, and elaborated the wounds of thirty-two of
our men who suffered injury, and even minutely and faithfully
described the nature of the wounds, in the interest of future
historians of the United States. It mentioned that a private had
one of his elbows scraped by a missile, and the private's name
was mentioned. Another private had the end of his nose scraped by
a missile. His name was also mentioned--by cable, at one dollar
and fifty cents a word.</p>

<p>Next day's news confirmed the previous day's report and named
our fifteen killed and thirty-two wounded <i>again</i><i>,</i>
and once more described the wounds and gilded them with the right
adjectives.</p>

<p>Let us now consider two or three details of our military
history. In one of the great battles of the Civil War 10 per cent
of the forces engaged on the two sides were killed and wounded.
At Waterloo, where four hundred thousand men were present on the
two sides, fifty thousand fell, killed and wounded, in five
hours, leaving three hundred and fifty thousand sound and all
right for further adventures. Eight years ago, when the pathetic
comedy called the Cuban War was played, we summoned two hundred
and fifty thousand men. We fought a number of showy battles, and
when the war was over we had lost two hundred and sixty-eight men
out of our two hundred and fifty thousand, in killed and wounded
in the field, and just <i>fourteen times as many</i> by the
gallantry of the army doctors in the hospitals and camps. We did
not exterminate the Spaniards--far from it. In each engagement we
left an average of <i>2 per cent</i> of the enemy killed or
crippled on the field.</p>

<p>Contrast these things with the great statistics which have
arrived from that Moro crater! There, with six hundred engaged on
each side, we lost fifteen men killed outright, and we had
thirty-two wounded--counting that nose and that elbow. The enemy
numbered six hundred--including women and children--and we
abolished them utterly, leaving not even a baby alive to cry for
its dead mother. <i>This is incomparably the greatest victory
that was ever achieved by the Christian soldiers of the United
States.</i></p>

<p>Now then, how has it been received? The splendid news appeared
with splendid display heads in every newspaper in this city of
four million and thirteen thousand inhabitants, on Friday
morning. But there was not a single reference to it in the
editorial columns of any one of those newspapers. The news
appeared again in all the evening papers of Friday, and again
those papers were editorially silent upon our vast achievement.
Next day's additional statistics and particulars appeared in all
the morning papers, and still without a line of editorial
rejoicing or a mention of the matter in any way. These additions
appeared in the evening papers of that same day (Saturday) and
again without a word of comment. In the columns devoted to
correspondence, in the morning and evening papers of Friday and
Saturday, nobody said a word about the "battle." Ordinarily those
columns are teeming with the passions of the citizen; he lets no
incident go by, whether it be large or small, without pouring out
his praise or blame, his joy or his indignation, about the matter
in the correspondence column. But, as I have said, during those
two days he was as silent as the editors themselves. So far as I
can find out, there was only one person among our eighty millions
who allowed himself the privilege of a public remark on this
great occasion--that was the President of the United States. All
day Friday he was as studiously silent as the rest. But on
Saturday he recognized that his duty required him to say
something, and he took his pen and performed that duty. If I know
President Roosevelt--and I am sure I do--this utterance cost him
more pain and shame than any other that ever issued from his pen
or his mouth. I am far from blaming him. If I had been in his
place my official duty would have compelled me to say what he
said. It was a convention, an old tradition, and he had to be
loyal to it. There was no help for it. This is what he said:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, <i>March 10.</i></p>

<p>WOOD, MANILA:</p>

<p>I congratulate you and the officers and men of your command
upon the brilliant feat of arms wherein you and they so well
upheld the honor of the American flag.</p>

<p>(Signed) THEODORE ROOSEVELT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>His whole utterance is merely a convention. Not a word of what
he said came out of his heart. He knew perfectly well that to pen
six hundred helpless and weaponless savages in a hole like rats
in a trap and massacre them in detail during a stretch of a day
and a half, from a safe position on the heights above, was no
brilliant feat of arms--and would not have been a brilliant feat
of arms even if Christian America, represented by its salaried
soldiers, had shot them down with bibles and the Golden Rule
instead of bullets. He knew perfectly well that our uniformed
assassins had <i>not</i> upheld the honor of the American flag,
but had done as they have been doing continuously for eight years
in the Philippines--that is to say, they had dishonored it.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday--which was yesterday--the cable brought
us additional news--still more splendid news--still more honor
for the flag. The first display head shouts this information at
us in stentorian capitals: "WOMEN SLAIN IN MORO SLAUGHTER."</p>

<p>"Slaughter" is a good word. Certainly there is not a better
one in the Unabridged Dictionary for this occasion.</p>

<p>The next display line says:</p>

<p><i>"With Children They Mixed in Mob in Crater, and All Died
Together."</i></p>

<p>They were mere naked savages, and yet there is a sort of
pathos about it when that word <i>children</i> falls under your
eye, for it always brings before us our perfectest symbol of
innocence and helplessness; and by help of its deathless
eloquence color, creed, and nationality vanish away and we see
only that they are children--merely children. And if they are
frightened and crying and in trouble, our pity goes out to them
by natural impulse. We see a picture. We see the small forms. We
see the terrified faces. We see the tears. We see the small hands
clinging in supplication to the mother; but we do not see those
children that we are speaking about. We see in their places the
little creatures whom we know and love.</p>

<p>The next heading blazes with American and Christian glory like
to the sun in the zenith:</p>

<p><i>"Death List is Now 900."</i></p>

<p>I was never so enthusiastically proud of the flag till
now!</p>

<p>The next heading explains how safely our daring soldiers were
located. It says:</p>

<p><i>"Impossible to Tell Sexes Apart in Fierce Battle on Top of
Mount Dajo."</i></p>

<p>The naked savages were so far away, down in the bottom of that
trap, that our soldiers could not tell the breasts of a woman
from the rudimentary paps of a man--so far away that they
couldn't tell a toddling little child from a black six-footer.
<i>This was by all odds the least dangerous battle that Christian
soldiers of any nationality were ever engaged in.</i></p>

<p>The next heading says:</p>

<p><i>"Fighting for Four Days."</i></p>

<p>So our men were at it four days instead of a day and a half.
It was a long and happy picnic with nothing to do but sit in
comfort and fire the Golden Rule into those people down there and
imagine letters to write home to the admiring families, and pile
glory upon glory. Those savages fighting for their liberties had
the four days, too, but it must have been a sorrowful time for
them. Every day they saw two hundred and twenty-five of their
number slain, and this provided them grief and mourning for the
night--and doubtless without even the relief and consolation of
knowing that in the meantime they had slain four of their enemies
and wounded some more on the elbow and the nose.</p>

<p>The closing heading says:</p>

<p><i>"Lieutenant Johnson Blown from Parapet by Exploding
Artillery Gallantly Leading Charge."</i></p>

<p>Lieutenant Johnson had pervaded the cablegrams from the first.
He and his wound have sparkled around through them like the
serpentine thread of fire that goes excursioning through the
black crisp fabric of a fragment of burnt paper. It reminds one
of Gillette's comedy farce of a few years ago. "Too Much
Johnson." Apparently Johnson was the only wounded man on our side
whose wound was worth anything as an advertisement. It has made a
great deal more noise in the world than has any similar event
since "Humpty Dumpty" fell off the wall and got injured. The
official dispatches do not know which to admire most, Johnson's
adorable wound or the nine hundred murders. The ecstasies flowing
from army headquarters on the other side of the globe to the
White House, at one dollar and a half a word, have set fire to
similar ecstasies in the President's breast. It appears that the
immortally wounded was a Rough Rider under Lieutenant-Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt at San Juan Hill--that twin of Waterloo--when
the colonel of the regiment, the present Major-General Dr.
Leonard Wood, went to the rear to bring up the pills and missed
the fight. The President has a warm place in his heart for
anybody who was present at that bloody collision of military
solar systems, and so he lost no time in cabling to the wounded
hero, "How are you?" And got a cable answer, "Fine, thanks." This
is historical. This will go down to posterity.</p>

<p>Johnson was wounded in the shoulder with a slug. The slug was
in a shell--for the account says the damage was caused by an
exploding shell which blew Johnson off the rim. The people down
in the hole had no artillery; therefore it was our artillery that
blew Johnson off the rim. And so it is now a matter of historical
record that the only officer of ours who acquired a wound of
advertising dimensions got it at our hands, and not the enemies'.
It seems more than probable that if we had placed our soldiers
out of the way of our own weapons, we should have come out of the
most extraordinary battle in all history without a scratch.</p>

General Wood explaining and apologizing.--What became of the
wounded?--President Roosevelt's joy over the splendid
achievement.--McKinley's joy over capture of Aguinaldo.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The ominous paralysis continues. There has been a slight
sprinkle--an exceedingly slight sprinkle--in the correspondence
columns, of angry rebukes of the President for calling this
cowardly massacre a "brilliant feat of arms" and for praising our
butchers for "holding up the honor of the flag" in that singular
way; but there is hardly a ghost of a whisper about the feat of
arms in the editorial columns of the papers.</p>

<p>I hope that this silence will continue. It is about as
eloquent and as damaging and effective as the most indignant
words could be, I think. When a man is sleeping in a noise, his
sleep goes placidly on; but if the noise stops, the stillness
wakes him. This silence has continued five days now. Surely it
must be waking the drowsy nation. Surely the nation must be
wondering what it means. A five-day silence following a
world-astonishing event has not happened on this planet since the
daily newspaper was invented.</p>

<p>At a luncheon party of men convened yesterday to God-speed
George Harvey, who is leaving today for a vacation in Europe, all
the talk was about the brilliant feat of arms; and no one had
anything to say about it that either the President or
Major-General Dr. Wood or the damaged Johnson would regard as
complimentary, or as proper comment to put into our histories.
Harvey said he believed that the shock and shame of this episode
would eat down deeper and deeper into the hearts of the nation
and fester there and produce results. He believed it would
destroy the Republican party and President Roosevelt. I cannot
believe that the prediction will come true, for the reason that
prophecies which promise valuable things, desirable things, good
things, worthy things, never come true. Prophecies of this kind
are like wars fought in a good cause--they are so rare that they
don't count.</p>

<p>Day before yesterday the cable note from the happy General
Doctor Wood was still all glorious. There was still proud mention
and elaboration of what was called the "desperate hand-to-hand
fight," Doctor Wood not seeming to suspect that he was giving
himself away, as the phrase goes--since if there was any very
desperate hand-to-hand fighting it would necessarily happen that
nine hundred hand-to-hand fighters, if really desperate, would
surely be able to kill more than fifteen of our men before their
last man and woman and child perished.</p>

<p>Very well, there was a new note in the dispatches yesterday
afternoon--just a faint suggestion that Doctor Wood was getting
ready to lower his tone and begin to apologize and explain. He
announces that he assumes full responsibility for the fight. It
indicates that he is aware that there is a lurking disposition
here amid all this silence to blame somebody. He says there was
"no wanton destruction of women and children in the fight, though
many of them were killed by force of necessity because the Moros
used them as shields in the hand-to-hand fighting."</p>

<p>This explanation is better than none; indeed, it is
considerably better than none. Yet if there was so much
hand-to-hand fighting there must have arrived a time, toward the
end of the four days' butchery, when only one native was left
alive. We had six hundred men present; we had lost only fifteen;
why did the six hundred kill that remaining man--or woman, or
child?</p>

<p>Doctor Wood will find that explaining things is not in his
line. He will find that where a man has the proper spirit in him
and the proper force at his command, it is easier to massacre
nine hundred unarmed animals than it is to explain why he made it
so remorselessly complete. Next he furnishes us this sudden burst
of unconscious humor, which shows that he ought to edit his
reports before he cables them:</p>

<p>"Many of the Moros feigned death and butchered the American
hospital men who were relieving the wounded."</p>

<p>We have the curious spectacle of hospital men going around
trying to relieve the wounded savages--for what reason? The
savages were all massacred. The plain intention was to massacre
them all and leave none alive. Then where was the use in
furnishing mere temporary relief to a person who was presently to
be exterminated? The dispatches call this battue a "battle." In
what way was it a battle? It has no resemblance to a battle. In a
battle there are always as many as five wounded men to one killed
outright. When this so-called battle was over, there were
certainly not fewer than two hundred wounded savages lying on the
field. What became of them? Since not one savage was left
alive!</p>

<p>The inference seems plain. We cleaned up our four days' work
and made it complete by butchering those helpless people.</p>

<p>The President's joy over this achievement brings to mind an
earlier presidential ecstasy. When the news came, in 1901, that
Colonel Funston had penetrated to the refuge of the patriot,
Aguinaldo, in the mountains, and had captured him by the use of
these arts, to wit: by forgery, by lies, by disguising his
military marauders in the uniform of the enemy, by pretending to
be friends of Aguinaldo's and by disarming suspicion by cordially
shaking hands with Aguinaldo's officers and in that moment
shooting them down--when the cablegram announcing this "brilliant
feat of arms" reached the White House, the newspapers said that
that meekest and mildest and gentlest of men, President McKinley,
could not control his joy and gratitude, but was obliged to
express it in motions resembling a dance.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yesterday, in the afternoon, I talked to the West Side Young
Men's Christian Association in the Majestic Theater. The audience
was to have been restricted to the membership, or at least to the
membership's sex, but I had asked for a couple of stage boxes and
had invited friends of mine of both sexes to occupy them. There
was trouble out at the doors and I became afraid that these
friends would not get in. My secretary volunteered to go out and
see if she could find them and rescue them from the crowd. She
was a pretty small person for such a service, but maybe her lack
of dimensions was in her favor, rather than against it. She
plowed her way through the incoming masculine wave and arrived
outside, where she captured the friends, and also had an
adventure. Just as the police were closing the doors of the
theater and announcing to the crowd that the place was full and
no more could be admitted, a flushed and excited man crowded his
way to the door and got as much as his nose in, but there the
officer closed the door and the man was outside. He and my
secretary were for the moment the center of attention--she
because of her solitariness in that sea of masculinity, and he
because he had been defeated before folks, a thing which we all
enjoy, even when we are West Side Young Christians and ought to
let on that we don't. The man looked down at my
secretary--anybody can do that without standing on a chair--and
he began pathetically--I say <i>began</i> pathetically; the
pathos of his manner and his words was confined to his beginning.
He began on my secretary, then shifted to the crowd for a finish.
He said, "I have been a member of this West Side Young Men's
Christian Association in good standing for seven years, and have
always done the best I could, yet never once got any reward." He
paused half an instant, shot a bitter glance at the closed door,
and added, with deep feeling, "It's just my God damned luck."</p>

<p>I think it damaged my speech for my secretary. The speech was
well enough--certainly better than the report of it in the
papers--but in spite of her compliments, I knew there was nothing
in it so good as what she had heard outside; and by the delight
which she exhibited in that outsider's eloquence I knew that she
knew it.</p>

<p>I will insert here a passage from the newspaper report,
because it refers to Patrick.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h3>DEFINITION OF A GENTLEMAN</h3>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark Twain went on to speak of the man who left $10,000 to
disseminate his definition of a gentleman. He denied that he had
ever defined one, but said if he did he would include the
mercifulness, fidelity, and justice the Scripture read at the
meeting spoke of. He produced a letter from William Dean Howells,
and said:</p>

<p>"He writes he is just sixty-nine, but I have known him longer
than that. 'I was born to be afraid of dying, not of getting
old,' he says. Well, I'm the other way. It's terrible getting
old. You gradually lose your faculties and fascinations and
become troublesome. People try to make you think you are not. But
I know I'm troublesome.</p>

<p>"Then he says no part of life is so enjoyable as the eighth
decade. That's true. I've just turned it, and I enjoy it very
much. 'If old men were not so ridiculous'--Why didn't he speak
for himself? 'But,' he goes on, 'they are ridiculous, and they
are ugly.' I never saw a letter with so many errors in it. Ugly!
I was never ugly in my life! Forty years ago I was not so
good-looking. A looking glass then lasted me three months. Now I
can wear it out in two days.</p>

<p>"'You've been up in Hartford burying poor old Patrick. I
suppose he was old, too,' says Mr. Howells. No, he was not old.
Patrick came to us thirty-six years ago--a brisk, lithe young
Irishman. He was as beautiful in his graces as he was in his
spirit, and he was as honest a man as ever lived. For twenty-five
years he was our coachman, and if I were going to describe a
gentleman in detail I would describe Patrick.</p>

<p>"At my own request I was his pallbearer with our old gardener.
He drove me and my bride so long ago. As the little children came
along he drove them, too. He was all the world to them, and for
all in my house he had the same feelings of honor, honesty, and
affection.</p>

<p>"He was sixty years old, ten years younger than I. Howells
suggests he was old. He was not old. He had the same gracious and
winning ways to the end. Patrick was a gentleman, and to him I
would apply the lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'So may I be courteous to men, faithful to friends,<br>
 True to my God, a fragrance in the path I trod.'"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>At the funeral I saw Patrick's family. I had seen no member of
it for a good many years. The children were men and women. When I
had seen them last they were little creatures. So far as I could
remember I had not seen them since as little chaps they joined
with ours, and with the children of the neighbors, in celebrating
Christmas Eve around a Christmas tree in our house, on which
occasion Patrick came down the chimney (apparently) disguised as
Saint Nicholas, and performed the part to the admiration of the
little and the big alike.</p>

<p>John, our old gardener, was a fellow pallbearer with me. The
rest were Irish coachmen and laborers--old friends of Patrick.
The cathedral was half filled with people.</p>

<p>I spent the night at Twichell's house, that night, and at noon
next day at the Hartford Club I met, at a luncheon, eleven of my
oldest friends--Charley Clarke, editor of the <i>Courant;</i>
Judge Hammersley of the Supreme Court; Colonel Cheney; Sam
Dunham; Twichell; Rev. Dr. Parker; Charles E. Perkins; Archie
Welsh. A deal of pretty jolly reminiscing was done, interspersed
with mournings over beloved members of the old comradeship whose
names have long ago been carved upon their gravestones.</p>

<p>Several things were told on Twichell illustrative of his wide
catholicity of feeling and conduct, and I was able to furnish
something in this line myself. Three or four years ago, when Sir
Thomas Upton came over here to race for the <i>America</i> cup, I
was invited to go with Mr. Rogers and a half a dozen other
worldlings in Mr. Rogers's yacht, the <i>Kanawha,</i> to see the
race. Mr. Rogers is fond of Twichell and wanted to invite him to
go also, but was afraid to do it because he thought Twichell
would be uncomfortable among those worldings. I said I didn't
think that would be the case. I said Twichell was chaplain in a
fighting brigade all through the Civil War, and was necessarily
familiar with about all the different kinds of worldlings that
could be started; so Mr. Rogers told me--though with many
misgivings--to invite him, and that he would do his best to see
that the worldlings should modify their worldliness and pay
proper respect and deference to Twichell's cloth.</p>

<p>When Twichell and I arrived at the pier at eight in the
morning, the launch was waiting for us. All the others were on
board. The yacht was anchored out there, ready to sail. Twichell
and I went aboard and ascended to the little drawing-room on the
upper deck. The door stood open, and as we approached we heard
hilarious laughter and talk proceeding from that place, and I
recognized that the worldlings were having a worldly good time.
But as Twichell appeared in the door all that hilarity ceased as
suddenly as if it had been shut off with an electric button, and
the gay faces of the worldlings at once put on a most proper and
impressive solemnity. The last word we had heard from these
people was the name of Richard Croker, the celebrated Tammany
leader, all-round blatherskite and chief pillager of the
municipal till. Twichell shook hands all around and broke out
with: "I heard you mention Richard Croker. I knew his father very
well indeed. He was head teamster in our brigade in the Civil
War--the Sickles brigade--a fine man--as fine a man as a person
would want to know. He was always splashed over with mud, of
course, but that didn't matter. The man inside the muddy clothes
was a whole man; and he was educated, he was highly educated. He
was a man who had read a great deal. And he was a Greek scholar;
not a mere surface scholar, but a real one; used to read aloud
from his Greek Testament, and when he hadn't it handy he could
recite from it from memory, and he did it well and with spirit.
Presently I was delighted to see that every now and then he would
come over of a Sunday morning and sit under the trees in our camp
with our boys and listen to my ministrations. I couldn't refrain
from introducing myself to him--that is, I couldn't refrain from
speaking to him about this, and I said: 'Mr. Croker, I want to
tell you what a pleasure it is to see you come and sit with my
boys and listen to me. For I know what it must cost you to do
this, and I want to express my admiration for a man who can put
aside his religious prejudices and manifest the breadth and
tolerance that you have manifested.' He flushed, and said with
eloquent emphasis, 'Mr. Twichell, do you take me for a God damned
papist?'"</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers said to me, aside, "This relieves me from my burden
of uneasiness."</p>

<p>Twichell, with his big heart, his wide sympathies, and his
limitless benignities and charities and generosities, is the kind
of person that people of all ages and both sexes fly to for
consolation and help in time of trouble. He is always being
levied upon by this kind of persons. Years ago--many years ago--a
soft-headed young donkey who had been reared under Mr. Twichell's
spiritual ministrations sought a private interview--a very
private interview--with him, and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Twichell, I wish you would give me some advice. It is a
very important matter with me. It lies near my heart and I want
to proceed wisely. Now it is like this: I have been down to the
Bermudas on the first vacation I have ever had in my life, and
there I met a most charming young lady, native of that place, and
I fell in love with her, Mr. Twichell. I fell in love with her,
oh so deeply! Well, I can't describe it, Mr. Twichell. I can't
describe it. I have never had such feelings before, and they just
consume me; they burn me up. When I got back here I found I
couldn't think of anybody but that girl. I wanted to write to
her, but I was afraid. I was afraid. It seemed too bold. I ought
to have taken advice, perhaps--but really I was not myself. I
<i>had</i> to write--I couldn't help it. So I wrote to her. I
wrote to her as guardedly as my feelings would allow--but I had
the sense all the time that I was too bold--I was too bold--she
wouldn't like it. I--Well, sometimes I would almost think maybe
she would answer; but then there would come a colder wave and I
would say, 'No, I shall never hear from her--she will be
offended.' But at last, Mr. Twichell, a letter <i>has</i> come. I
don't know how to contain myself. I want to write again, but I
may spoil it--I may spoil it--and I want your advice. Tell me if
I had better venture. Now here she has written--here is her
letter, Mr. Twichell. She says this: she says--she says--'You say
in your letter you wish it could be your privilege to see me half
your time. How would you like it to see me <i>all</i> the time?'
What do you think of that, Mr. Twichell? How does that strike
you? Do you think she is not offended? Do you think that that
indicates a sort of a shadowy leaning toward me? Do you think it,
Mr. Twichell? Could you say that?"</p>

<p>"Well," Twichell said, "I would not like to be too sanguine. I
would not like to commit myself too far. I would not like to put
hopes into your mind which could fail of fruition, but, on the
whole--on the whole--daring is a good thing in these cases.
Sometimes daring--a bold front--will accomplish things that
timidity would fail to accomplish. I think I would write
her--guardedly of course--but write her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Twichell, oh, you don't know how happy you do make
me! I'll write her right away. But I'll be guarded. I'll be
careful--careful."</p>

<p>Twichell read the rest of the letter--saw that this girl was
just simply throwing herself at this young fellow's head and was
going to capture him by fair means or foul, but capture him. But
he sent the young fellow away to write the guarded letter.</p>

<p>In due time he came with the girl's second letter and said:
"Mr. Twichell, will you read that? Now read that. How does that
strike you? Is she kind of leaning my way? I wish you could say
so, Mr. Twichell. You see there, what she says. She says--'You
offer to send me a present of a ring--' I did it, Mr. Twichell! I
declare it was a bold thing--but--but--I couldn't help it. I did
that intrepid thing--and that is what she says: 'You offer to
send me a ring. But my father is going to take a little vacation
excursion in the New England states and he is going to let me go
with him. If you should send the ring here it might get lost. We
shall be in Hartford a day or two. Won't it be safer to wait till
then and you put it on my finger yourself?'</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Mr. Twichell? How does it strike
you? Is she leaning? Is she leaning?"</p>

<p>"Well," Twichell said, "I don't know about that. I must not be
intemperate. I must not say things too strongly, for I might be
making a mistake. But I think--I think--on the whole I think she
is leaning--I do--I think she is leaning--"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Twichell, it does my heart so much good to hear you
say that! Mr. Twichell, if there was anything I could do to show
my gratitude for those words--well, you see the condition I am
in--and to have you say that--"</p>

<p>Twichell said: "Now wait a minute--now let's not make any
mistake here. Don't you know that this is a most serious
position? It can have the most serious results upon two lives.
You know there is such a thing as a mere passing fancy that sets
a person's soul on fire for the moment. That person thinks it is
love, and that it is permanent love--that it is real love. Then
he finds out, by and by, that it was but a momentary insane
passion--and then perhaps he has committed himself for life, and
he wishes he was out of that predicament. Now let us make sure of
this thing. I believe that if you try, and conduct yourself
wisely and cautiously--I don't feel sure, but I believe that if
you conduct yourself wisely and cautiously you can beguile that
girl into marrying you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Twichell, I can't express--"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind expressing anything. What I am coming at is
this: let us make sure of our position. If this is <i>real</i>
love, go ahead! If it is nothing but a passing fancy, drop it
right here, for both your sakes. Now tell me, is it real love? If
it is real love how do you arrive at that conclusion? Have you
some way of proving to your entire satisfaction that this
<i>is</i> real, genuine, lasting, permanent love?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Twichell, I can tell you this. You can just judge for
yourself. From the time that I was a baby in the cradle up, Mr.
Twichell, I have had to sleep close to my mother, with a door
open between, because I have always been subject to the most
horrible nightmares, and when they break out my mother has to
come running from her bed and appease me and comfort me and
pacify me. Now then, Mr. Twichell, from the cradle up, whenever I
got hit with those nightmare convulsions I have always sung out,
'Mamma, Mamma, Mamma.' Now I sing out, 'Mary Ann, Mary Ann, Mary
Ann.'"</p>

<p>So they were married. They moved to the West and we know
nothing more about the romance.</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty years ago, Decoration Day happened to be
more like the Fourth of July for temperature than like the 30th
of May. Twichell was orator of the day. He pelted his great crowd
of old Civil War soldiers for an hour in the biggest church in
Hartford, while they mourned and sweltered. Then they marched
forth and joined the procession of other old soldiers and tramped
through clouds of dust to the cemetery and began to distribute
the flags and the flowers--a tiny flag and a small basket of
flowers to each military grave. This industry went on and on and
on, everybody breathing dust--for there was nothing else to
breathe; everybody streaming with perspiration; everybody tired
and wishing it was over. At last there was but one basket of
flowers left, only one grave still undecorated. A fiery little
major, whose patience was all gone, was shouting:</p>

<p>"Corporal Henry Jones, Company C, Fourteenth Connecticut
Infantry--"</p>

<p>No response. Nobody seemed to know where that corporal was
buried.</p>

<p>The major raised his note a degree or two higher:</p>

<p>"Corporal Henry Jones, Company C, Fourteenth Connecticut
Infantry. Doesn't anybody know where that man is buried?"</p>

<p>No response. Once, twice, three times, he shrieked again, with
his temper ever rising higher and higher:</p>

<p>"Corporal Henry Jones, Company C, Fourteenth Connecticut
Infantry. Doesn't anybody know where that man is buried?"</p>

<p>No response. Then he slammed the basket of flowers on the
ground and said to Twichell, "Proceed with the finish."</p>

<p>The crowd massed themselves together around Twichell with
uncovered heads, the silence and solemnity interrupted only by
subdued sneezings, for these people were buried in the dim cloud
of dust. After a pause Twichell began an impressive prayer,
making it brief to meet the exigencies of the occasion. In the
middle of it he made a pause. The drummer thought he was through,
and let fly a rub-a-dub-dub--and the little major stormed out,
<i>"Stop</i> that drum!" Twichell tried again. He got almost to
the last word safely, when somebody trod on a dog and the dog let
out a howl of anguish that could be heard beyond the frontier.
The major said, "God damn that dog!"--and Twichell said,
"Amen."</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Friday, March 16, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Schoolmates of sixty years ago: Mary Miller, one of Mr.
Clemens's first sweethearts--Artimisia Briggs, another--Mary
Lacy, another--Jimmie McDaniel, to whom Mr. Clemens told his
first humorous story.--Mr. Richmond, Sunday-school teacher,
afterwards owner of Tom Sawyer's cave, which is now being ground
into cement.--Hickman, the showy young captain.--Reuel Gridley,
and the sack of flour incident.--The Levin Jew boys called
Twenty-two.--George Butler, nephew of Ben Butler.--The incident
of getting into bed with Will Bowen to catch the measles, and the
successful and nearly fatal case which resulted.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>We will return to those school children of sixty years ago. I
recall Mary Miller. She was not my first sweetheart, but I think
she was the first one that furnished me a broken heart. I fell in
love with her when she was eighteen and I nine--but she scorned
me, and I recognized that this was a cold world. I had not
noticed that temperature before. I believe I was as miserable as
a grown man could be. But I think that this sorrow did not remain
with me long. As I remember it, I soon transferred my worship to
Artimisia Briggs, who was a year older than Mary Miller. When I
revealed my passion to her she did not scoff at it. She did not
make fun of it. She was very kind and gentle about it. But she
was also firm, and said she did not want to be pestered by
children.</p>

<p>And there was Mary Lacy. She was a schoolmate. But she also
was out of my class because of her advanced age. She was pretty
wild and determined and independent. She was ungovernable, and
was considered incorrigible. But that was all a mistake. She
married, and at once settled down and became in all ways a model
matron and was as highly respected as any matron in the town.
Four years ago she was still living, and had been married fifty
years.</p>

<p>Jimmie McDaniel was another schoolmate. His age and mine about
tallied. His father kept the candy shop and he was the most
envied little chap in the town--after Tom Blankenship--for,
although we never saw him eating candy, we supposed that it was,
nevertheless, his ordinary diet. He pretended that he never ate
it, didn't care for it because there was nothing forbidden about
it--there was plenty of it and he could have as much of it as he
wanted. Still, there was circumstantial evidence that suggested
that he only scorned candy in public to show off, for he had the
worst teeth in town. He was the first human being to whom I ever
told a humorous story, so far as I can remember. This was about
Jim Wolfe and the cats; and I gave him that tale the morning
after that memorable episode. I thought he would laugh his
remaining teeth out. I had never been so proud and happy before,
and I have seldom been so proud and happy since. I saw him four
years ago when I was out there. He was working in a cigar-making
shop. He wore an apron that came down to his knees and a beard
that came nearly half as far, and yet it was not difficult for me
to recognize him. He had been married fifty-four years. He had
many children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and also
even posterity, they all said--thousands--yet the boy to whom I
had told the cat story when we were fourteen years old was still
present in that cheerful little old man.</p>

<p>Artimisia Briggs got married not long after refusing me. She
married Richmond, the stone mason, who was my Methodist
Sunday-school teacher in the earliest days, and he had one
distinction which I envied him: He was a very kindly and
considerate Sunday-school teacher, and patient and compassionate,
so he was the favorite teacher with us little chaps. In that
school they had slender oblong pasteboard blue tickets, each with
a verse from the Testament printed on it, and you could get a
blue ticket by reciting two verses. By reciting five verses you
could get three blue tickets, and you could trade these at the
bookcase and borrow a book for a week. I was under Mr. Richmond's
spiritual care every now and then for two or three years, and he
was never hard upon me. I always recited the same five verses
every Sunday. He was always satisfied with the performance. He
never seemed to notice that these were the same five foolish
virgins that he had been hearing about every Sunday for months. I
always got my tickets and exchanged them for a book. They were
pretty dreary books, for there was not a bad boy in the entire
bookcase. They were <i>all</i> good boys and good girls and
drearily uninteresting, but they were better society than none,
and I was glad to have their company and disapprove of it.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago Mr. Richmond had become possessed of Tom
Sawyer's cave in the hills three miles from town, and had made a
tourist resort of it. In 1849, when the gold-seekers were
streaming through our little town of Hannibal, many of our grown
men got the gold fever, and I think that all the boys had it. On
the Saturday holidays in summertime we used to borrow skiffs
whose owners were not present and go down the river three miles
to the cave hollow, and there we staked out claims and pretended
to dig gold, panning out half a dollar a day at first; two or
three times as much, later, and by and by whole fortunes, as our
imaginations became inured to the work. Stupid and un-prophetic
lads! We were doing this in play and never suspecting. Why, that
cave hollow and all the adjacent hills were made of gold!--but we
did not know it. We took it for dirt. We left its rich secret in
its own peaceful possession and grew up in poverty and went
wandering about the world struggling for bread--and this because
we had not the gift of prophecy. That region was all dirt and
rocks to us, yet all it needed was to be ground up and
scientifically handled and it was gold. That is to say, the whole
region was a cement mine--and they make the finest kind of
Portland cement there now, five thousand barrels a day, with a
plant that cost $2,000,000.</p>

<p>Several months ago a telegram came to me from there saying
that Tom Sawyer's cave was now being ground into cement. Would I
like to say anything about it in public? But I had nothing to
say. I was sorry we lost our cement mine, but it was not worth
while to talk about it at this late day, and, to take it all
around, it was a painful subject, anyway. There are seven miles
of Tom Sawyer's cave--that is to say, the lofty ridge which
conceals that cave stretches down the bank of the Mississippi
seven miles to the town of Saverton.</p>

<p>For a little while Reuel Gridley attended that school of ours.
He was an elderly pupil; he was perhaps twenty-two or
twenty-three years old. Then came the Mexican War and he
volunteered. A company of infantry was raised in our town and Mr.
Hickman, a tall, straight, handsome athlete of twenty-five, was
made captain of it and had a sword by his side and a broad yellow
stripe down the leg of his gray uniform pants. And when that
company marched back and forth through the streets in its smart
uniform--which it did several times a day for drill--its
evolutions were attended by all the boys whenever the school
hours permitted. I can see that marching company yet, and I can
almost feel again the consuming desire that I had to join it. But
they had no use for boys of twelve and thirteen, and before I had
a chance in another war the desire to kill people to whom I had
not been introduced had passed away.</p>

<p>I saw the splendid Hickman in his old age. He seemed about the
oldest man I had ever seen--an amazing and melancholy contrast
with the showy young captain I had seen preparing his warriors
for carnage so many, many years before. Hickman is dead--it is
the old story. As Susy said, "What is it all for?"</p>

<p>Reuel Gridley went away to the wars and we heard of him no
more for fifteen or sixteen years. Then one day in Carson City,
while I was having a difficulty with an editor on the
sidewalk--an editor better built for war than I was--I heard a
voice say: "Give him the best you've got, Sam. I'm at your back."
It was Reuel Gridley. He said he had not recognized me by my
face, but by my drawling style of speech.</p>

<p>He went down to the Reese River mines about that time and
presently he lost an election bet in his mining camp, and by the
terms of it he was obliged to buy a fifty-pound sack of
self-rising flour and carry it through the town, preceded by
music, and deliver it to the winner of the bet. Of course the
whole camp was present and full of fluid and enthusiasm. The
winner of the bet put up the sack at auction for the benefit of
the United States Sanitary Fund, and sold it. The purchaser put
it up for the Fund and sold it. The excitement grew and grew. The
sack was sold over and over again for the benefit of the Fund.
The news of it came to Virginia City by telegraph. It produced
great enthusiasm, and Reuel Gridley was begged by telegraph to
bring the sack and have an auction in Virginia City. He brought
it. An open barouche was provided, also a brass band. The sack
was sold over and over again at Gold Hill, then was brought up to
Virginia City toward night and sold--and sold again, netting
twenty or thirty thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Gridley
carried it across California, selling it at various towns. He
sold it for large sums in Sacramento and in San Francisco. He
brought it East, sold it in New York and in various other cities,
finally carried it out to a great fair at St. Louis, went on
selling it, finally made it up into small cakes and sold those at
a dollar apiece. First and last, the sack of flour which had
originally cost five dollars, perhaps, netted more than two
hundred thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Reuel Gridley has
been dead these many, many years--it is the old story.</p>

<p>In that school were the first Jews I had ever seen. It took me
a good while to get over the awe of it. To my fancy they were
clothed invisibly in the damp and cobwebby mold of antiquity.
They carried me back to Egypt, and in imagination I moved among
the Pharaohs and all the shadowy celebrities of that remote age.
The name of the boys was Levin. We had a collective name for them
which was the only really large and handsome witticism that was
ever born on those premises. We called them Twenty-two--and even
when the joke was old and had been worn threadbare we always
followed it with the explanation, to make sure that it would be
understood, "Twice Levin--twenty-two."</p>

<p>There were other boys whose names remain with me. Irving
Ayres--but no matter; he's dead.</p>

<p>George Butler, whom I remember as a child of seven wearing a
blue leather belt with a brass buckle, and hated and envied by
all the boys on account of it. He was a nephew of General Ben
Butler and fought gallantly at Ball's Bluff and in several other
actions of the Civil War. He is dead, long and long ago.</p>

<p>Will Bowen (dead long ago), Ed Stevens (dead long ago) and
John Briggs were special mates of mine. John is still living.</p>

<p>In 1845, when I was ten years old, there was an epidemic of
measles in the town and it made a most alarming slaughter among
the little people. There was a funeral almost daily, and the
mothers of the town were nearly demented with fright. My mother
was greatly troubled. She worried over Pamela and Henry and me,
and took constant and extraordinary pains to keep us from coming
into contact with the contagion. But upon reflection I believed
that her judgment was at fault. It seemed to me that I could
improve upon it if left to my own devices. I cannot remember now
whether I was frightened about the measles or not, but I clearly
remember that I grew very tired of the suspense I suffered on
account of being continually under the threat of death. I
remember that I got so weary of it and so anxious to have the
matter settled one way or the other, and promptly, that this
anxiety spoiled my days and my nights. I had no pleasure in them.
I made up my mind to end this suspense and settle this matter one
way or the other and be done with it. Will Bowen was dangerously
ill with the measles and I thought I would go down there and
catch them. I entered the house by the front way and slipped
along through rooms and halls, keeping sharp watch against
discovery, and at last I reached Will's bedroom in the rear of
the house on the second floor and got into it uncaptured. But
that was as far as my victory reached. His mother caught me there
a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a
most competent scolding and drove me away. She was so scared that
she could hardly get her words out, and her face was white. I saw
that I must manage better next time, and I did. I hung about the
lane at the rear of the house and watched through cracks in the
fence until I was convinced that the conditions were favorable.
Then I slipped through the back yard and up the back way and got
into the room and into the bed with Will Bowen without being
observed. I don't know how long I was in the bed. I only remember
that Will Bowen, as society, had no value for me, for he was too
sick to even notice that I was there. When I heard his mother
coming I covered up my head, but that device was a failure. It
was dead summertime--the cover was nothing more than a limp
blanket or sheet, and anybody could see that there were two of us
under it. It didn't remain two very long. Mrs. Bowen snatched me
out of that bed and conducted me home herself, with a grip on my
collar which she never loosened until she delivered me into my
mother's hands along with her opinion of that kind of a boy.</p>

<p>It was a good case of measles that resulted. It brought me
within a shade of death's door. It brought me to where I no
longer felt any interest in anything, but, on the contrary, felt
a total absence of interest--which was most placid and tranquil
and sweet and delightful and enchanting. I have never enjoyed
anything in my life any more than I enjoyed dying that time. I
was, in effect, dying. The word had been passed and the family
notified to assemble around the bed and see me off. I knew them
all. There was no doubtfulness in my vision. They were all
crying, but that did not affect me. I took but the vaguest
interest in it, and that merely because I was the center of all
this emotional attention and was gratified by it and felt
complimented. When Doctor Cunningham had made up his mind that
nothing more could be done for me he put bags of hot ashes all
over me. He put them on my breast, on my wrists, on my ankles;
and so, very much to his astonishment--and doubtless to my
regret--he dragged me back into this world and set me going
again.</p>

Dr. John Brown's letters a failure.--Mr. Twichell and his wife,

<p> </p>

<p>Certainly mental telegraphy is an industry which is always
silently at work--oftener than otherwise, perhaps, when we are
not suspecting that it is affecting our thought. A few weeks ago
when I was dictating something about Dr. John Brown of Edinburgh
and our pleasant relations with him during six weeks there, and
his pleasant relations with our little child, Susy, he had not
been in my mind for a good while--a year, perhaps--but he has
often been in my mind since, and his name has been frequently
upon my lips and as frequently falling from the point of my pen.
About a fortnight ago I began to plan an article about him and
about Marjorie Fleming, whose first biographer he was, and
yesterday I began the article. To-day comes a letter from his son
Jock, from whom I had not previously heard for a good many years.
He has been engaged in collecting his father's letters for
publication. This labor would naturally bring me into his mind
with some frequency, and I judge that his mind telegraphed his
thoughts to me across the Atlantic. I imagine that we get most of
our thoughts out of somebody else's head, by mental
telegraphy--and not always out of heads of acquaintances, but, in
the majority of cases, out of the heads of strangers; strangers
far removed--Chinamen, Hindus, and all manner of remote
foreigners whose language we should not be able to understand,
but whose thoughts we can read without difficulty.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 GREENHILL PLACE,<br>
 EDINBURGH,<br>
 <i>8th March, 1906.</i></p>

<p>DEAR MR. CLEMENS:</p>

<p>I hope you remember me, Jock, son of Dr. John Brown. At my
father's death I handed to Dr. J. T. Brown all the letters I had
to my father, as he intended to write his life, being his cousin
and life-long friend. He did write a memoir, published after his
death in 1901, but he made no use of the letters and it was
little more than a critique of his writings. If you care to see
it I shall send it. Among the letters which I got back in 1902
were some from you and Mrs. Clemens. I have now got a large
number of letters written by my father between 1830 and 1882 and
intend publishing a selection in order to give the public an idea
of the man he was. This I think they will do. Miss E. T. MacLaren
is to add the necessary notes. I now write to ask you if you have
letters from him and if you will let me see them and use them. I
enclose letters from yourself and Mrs. Clemens which I should
like to use, 15 sheets typewritten. Though I did not write as I
should to you on the death of Mrs. Clemens, I was very sorry to
hear of it through the papers, and as I now read these letters,
she rises before me, gentle and lovable as I knew her. I do hope
you will let me use her letter, it is most beautiful, I also hope
you will let me use yours. . . .</p>

<p>I am</p>

<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p>JOHN BROWN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>We have searched for Doctor John's letters, but without
success. I do not understand this. There ought to be a good many,
and none should be missing, for Mrs. Clemens held Doctor John in
such love and reverence that his letters were sacred things in
her eyes and she preserved them and took watchful care of them.
During our ten years' absence in Europe many letters and like
memorials became scattered and lost, but I think it unlikely that
Doctor John's have suffered this fate. I think we shall find them
yet.</p>

<p>These thoughts about Jock bring back to me the Edinburgh of
thirty-three years ago, and the thought of Edinburgh brings to my
mind one of Rev. Joe Twichell's adventures. A quarter of a
century ago Twichell and Harmony, his wife, visited Europe for
the first time, and made a stay of a day or two in Edinburgh.
They were devotees of Scott, and they devoted that day or two to
ransacking Edinburgh for things and places made sacred by contact
with the Magician of the North. Toward midnight, on the second
night, they were returning to their lodgings on foot; a dismal
and steady rain was falling, and by consequence they had George
Street all to themselves. Presently the rainfall became so heavy
that they took refuge from it in a deep doorway, and there in the
black darkness they discussed with satisfaction all the
achievements of the day. Then Joe said:</p>

<p>"It has been hard work, and a heavy strain on the strength,
but we have our reward. There isn't a thing connected with Scott
in Edinburgh that we haven't seen or touched--not one. I mean the
things a stranger <i>could</i> have access to. There is
<i>one</i> we haven't seen, but it's not accessible--a private
collection of relics and memorials of Scott of great interest,
but I do not know where it is. I can't get on the track of it. I
wish we could, but we can't. We've got to give the idea up. It
would be a grand thing to have a sight of that collection,
Harmony."</p>

<p>A voice out of the darkness said, "Come upstairs and I will
show it to you."</p>

<p>And the voice was as good as its word. The voice belonged to
the gentleman who owned the collection. He took Joe and Harmony
upstairs, fed them and refreshed them; and while they examined
the collection he chatted and explained. When they left at two in
the morning they realized that they had had the star time of
their trip.</p>

<p>Joe has always been on hand when anything was going to
happen--except once. He got delayed in some vexatious and
unaccountable way, or he would have been blown up at Petersburg
when the mined defenses of that place were flung heavenward in
the Civil War.</p>

<p>When I was in Hartford the other day he told me about another
of his long string of providential opportunities. I think he
thinks Providence is always looking out for him when interesting
things are going to happen. This was the execution of some
deserters during the Civil War. When we read about such things in
history we always have the same picture--blindfolded men kneeling
with their heads bowed; a file of stern and alert soldiers
fronting them with their muskets ready; an austere officer in
uniform standing apart who gives sharp terse orders: "Make ready.
Take aim. Fire." There is a belch of flame and smoke, the victims
fall forward, expiring, the file shoulders arms, wheels, marches
erect and stiff-legged off the field, and the incident is
closed.</p>

<p>Joe's picture is different. And I suspect that it is the true
one--the common one. In this picture the deserters requested that
they might be allowed to stand, not kneel; that they might not be
blindfolded, but permitted to look the firing file in the eye.
These requests were granted. The men stood erect and soldierly;
they kept their color, they did not blench; their eyes were
steady. But these things could not be said of any other of the
persons present. A general of brigade sat upon his horse,
white-faced--white as a corpse. The officer commanding the squad
was white-faced--white as a corpse. The firing file were
white-faced and their forms wobbled so that the wobble was
transmitted to their muskets when they took aim. The officer of
the squad could not command his voice, and his tone was weak and
poor, not brisk and stern. When the file had done its deadly work
it did not march away martially erect and stiff-legged. It
wobbled.</p>

<p>This picture commends itself to me as being the truest one
that any one has yet furnished of a military execution.</p>

<p>In searching for Doctor Brown's letters--a failure--we have
made a find which we were not expecting. Evidently it marks the
foundation of the Players' Club, and so it has value for me.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DALY'S THEATRE,</p>

<p>NEW YORK, <i>Jan. 2, 1888.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Augustin Daly will be very much pleased to have Mr. S. L.
Clemens meet Mr. Booth, Mr. Barrett and Mr. Palmer and a few
friends at lunch on Friday next, January 6th (at one o'clock in
Delmonico's) to discuss the formation of a new club which it is
thought will claim your interest.</p>

<p>R.S.V.P.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>All the founders, I think, were present at that
luncheon--among them Booth, Barrett, Palmer, General Sherman,
Bispham, Aldrich, and the rest. I do not recall the other names.
I think Laurence Hutton states in one of his books that the
club's name--The Players'--had been already selected and accepted
before this luncheon took place, but I take that to be a mistake.
I remember that several names were proposed, discussed, and
abandoned at the luncheon; that finally Thomas Bailey Aldrich
suggested that compact and simple name, The Players'; and that
even that happy title was not immediately accepted. However, the
discussion was very brief. The objections to it were easily
routed and driven from the field, and the vote in its favor was
unanimous.</p>

<p>I lost my interest in the club three years ago--for cause--but
it has lately returned to me, to my great satisfaction. Mr.
Booth's bequest was a great and generous one--but he left two.
The other one was not much of a benefaction. It was a relative of
his who needed a support. As secretary he governed the club and
its board of managers like an autocrat from the beginning until
three or four months ago, when he retired from his position
superannuated. From the beginning, I left my dues and costs to be
paid by my business agent in Hartford--Mr. Whitmore. He attended
to all business of mine. I interested myself in none of it. When
we went to Europe in '91 I left a written order in the
secretary's office continuing Whitmore in his function of
paymaster of my club dues. Nothing happened until a year had gone
by. Then a bill for dues reached me in Europe. I returned it to
the secretary and reminded him of my order, which had not been
changed. Then for a couple of years the bills went to Whitmore,
after which a bill came to me in Europe. I returned it with the
previous remarks repeated. But about every two years the sending
of bills to me would be resumed. I sent them back with the usual
remarks. Twice the bills were accompanied by offensive letters
from the secretary. These I answered profanely. At last we came
home, in 1901. No bills came to me for a year. Then we took a
residence at Riverdale-on-the-Hudson, and straightway came a
Players' bill for dues. I was aweary, aweary, and I put it in the
waste basket. Ten days later the bill came again, and with it a
shadowy threat. I waste-basketed it. After another ten days the
bill came once more, and this time the threat was in a concreted
condition. It said very peremptorily that if the bill were not
paid within a week I would be expelled from the club and posted
as a delinquent. This went the way of its predecessors, into the
waste basket. On the named day I was posted as expelled.</p>

<p>Robert Reid, David Munro, and other special friends in the
club were astonished and put themselves in communication with me
to find out what this strange thing meant. I explained to them.
They wanted me to state the case to the management and require a
reconsideration of the decree of expulsion, but I had to decline
that proposition. And therefore things remained as they were
until a few months ago, when the ancient secretary retired from
the autocracy. The boys thought that my return to the club would
be plain and simple sailing now, but I thought differently. I was
no longer a member. I could not become a member without
consenting to be voted for by the board, like any other
candidate, and I would not do that. The management had expelled
me upon the mere statement of a clerk that I was a delinquent.
They had not asked me to testify in my defense. They might
properly argue from that that I had not all of a sudden become a
rascal, and that I might be able to explain the situation if
asked. The board's whole proceeding had been like <i>all</i> the
board's proceedings from the beginning--arbitrary, insolent,
stupid. That board's proper place, from the beginning, was the
idiot asylum. I could not allow myself to be voted for again,
because from my view of the matter I had never lawfully and
legitimately ceased to be a member. However, a way fair and
honorable to all concerned was easily found to bridge the
separating crack. I was made an honorary member, and I have been
glad to resume business at the old stand.</p>

<p>I stopped in the middle of mamma's early history to tell about
our tripp to Vassar because I was afraid I would forget about it,

died papa took mamma and little Langdon to Elmira for the summer.
When in Elmira Langdon began to fail but I think mamma did not
know just what was the matter with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I was the cause of the child's illness. His mother trusted him
to my care and I took him for a long drive in an open barouche
for an airing. It was a raw, cold morning, but he was well
wrapped about with furs and, in the hands of a careful person, no
harm would have come to him. But I soon dropped into a reverie
and forgot all about my charge. The furs fell away and exposed
his bare legs. By and by the coachman noticed this, and I
arranged the wraps again, but it was too late. The child was
almost frozen. I hurried home with him, I was aghast at what I
had done, and I feared the consequences. I have always felt shame
for that treacherous morning's work and have not allowed myself
to think of it when I could help it. I doubt if I had the courage
to make confession at that time. I think it most likely that I
have never confessed until now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At last it was time for papa to return to Hartford, and
Langdon was real sick at that time, but still mamma decided to go
with him, thinking the journey might do him good. But after they
reached Hartford he became very sick, and his trouble prooved to
be diptheeria. He died about a week after mamma and papa reached
Hartford. He was burried by the side of grandpa at Elmira, New
York. [Susy rests there with them.--S. L. C.] After that, mamma
became very very ill, so ill that there seemed great danger of
death, but with a great deal of good care she recovered. Some
months afterward mamma and papa [and Susy, who was perhaps
fourteen or fifteen months old at the time.--S. L. C.] went to
Europe and stayed for a time in Scotland and England. In Scotland
mamma and papa became very well equanted with Dr. John Brown, the
author of "Rab and His Friends," and he met, but was not so well
equanted with, Mr. Charles Kingsley, Mr. Henry M. Stanley, Sir
Thomas Hardy grandson of the Captain Hardy to whom Nellson said
"Kiss me Hardy," when dying on shipboard, Mr. Henry Irving,
Robert Browning, Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. Charles Reade, Mr.
William Black, Lord Houghton, Frank Buckland, Mr. Tom Hughes,
Anthony Trollope, Tom Hood, son of the poet--and mamma and papa
were quite well equanted with Dr. Macdonald and family, and papa
met Harison Ainsworth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I remember all these men very well indeed, except the last
one. I do not recall Ainsworth. By my count, Susy mentions
fourteen men. They are all dead except Sir Charles Dilke and Mr.
Tom Hughes.</p>

<p>We met a great many other interesting people, among them Lewis
Carroll, author of the immortal <i>Alice</i>--but he was only
interesting to look at, for he was the stillest and shyest
full-grown man I have ever met except "Uncle Remus." Doctor
Macdonald and several other lively talkers were present, and the
talk went briskly on for a couple of hours, but Carroll sat still
all the while except that now and then he answered a question.
His answers were brief. I do not remember that he elaborated any
of them.</p>

<p>At a dinner at Smalley's we met Herbert Spencer. At a large
luncheon party at Lord Houghton's we met Sir Arthur Helps, who
was a celebrity of worldwide fame at the time, but is quite
forgotten now. Lord Elcho, a large, vigorous man, sat at some
distance down the table. He was talking earnestly about
Godalming. It was a deep and flowing and unarticulated rumble,
but I got the Godalming pretty clearly every time it broke free
of the rumble, and as all the strength was on the first end of
the word it startled me every time, because it sounded so like
swearing. In the middle of the luncheon Lady Houghton rose,
remarked to the guests on her right and on her left in a
matter-of-fact way, "Excuse me, I have an engagement," and
without further ceremony she went off to meet it. This would have
been doubtful etiquette in America. Lord Houghton told a number
of delightful stories. He told them in French, and I lost nothing
of them but the nubs.</p>

<p>I will insert here one or two of the letters referred to by
Jock Brown in the letter which I received from him a day or two
ago, and which we copied into yesterday's record:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>June 22, 1876.</i></p>

<p>DEAR DOCTOR BROWN:</p>

<p>Indeed I was a happy woman to see the familiar handwriting. I
do hope that we shall not have to go so long again without a word
from you. I wish you could come over to us for a season; it seems
as if it would do you good, you and yours would be so very
welcome.</p>

<p>We are now where we were two years ago, on the farm on the top
of a high hill where my sister spends her summers. The children
are grown fat and hearty, feeding chickens and ducks twice a day,
and are keenly alive to all the farm interests. Mr. J. T. Fields

<p>DEAR DOCTOR BROWN:</p>

<p>We had grown so very anxious about you that it was a great
pleasure to see the dear, familiar handwriting again, but the
contents of the letter did make us <i>inexpressibly sad</i>. We
have talked so much since about your coming to see us. Would not
the change do you good? Could you not trust yourself with us? We
would do everything to make you comfortable, and happy that we
could, and you have so many admirers in America that would be so
happy and proud to welcome you. Is it not possible for you to
come? Perhaps the entire change would give you a new and
healthier lease of life.</p>

<p>Our children are both well and happy; I wish that you could
see them. Susie is very motherly to the little one. Mr. Clemens
is hard at work on a new book now. He has a new book of sketches
recently out, which he is going to send you in a few days; most
of the sketches are old, but some few are new.</p>

<p>Oh Doctor Brown how can you speak of your life as a wasted
one? What you have written has alone done an <i>immense</i>
amount of good, and I know for I speak from experience that one
must get good every time they meet and chat with you. I receive
good every time I even <i>think</i> of you. Can a life that
produces such an effect on others be a wasted life? I feel that
while you live the world is sweeter and better. You ask if Clara
is "queer and wistful and commanding," like your Susie. We think
she is more queer, (more quaint) perhaps more commanding, but not
nearly so wistful in her ways as "your Susie." . . . I must leave
a place for Mr. C. Do you think about coming to us. Give my love
to your sister and your son. Affectionately,</p>

<p>HARTFORD, <i>June 1, 1882.</i></p>

<p>MY DEAR MR. BROWN:</p>

<p>I was three thousand miles from home, at breakfast in New
Orleans, when the damp morning paper revealed the sorrowful news
among the cable dispatches. There was no place in America,
however remote, or however rich or poor or high or humble, where
words of mourning for your honoured father were not uttered that
morning, for his works had made him known and loved all over the
land. To Mrs. Clemens and me, the loss is a personal one, and our
grief the grief which one feels for one who was peculiarly near
and dear. Mrs. Clemens has never ceased to express regret that we
came away from England the last time without going to see him,
and often we have since projected a voyage across the Atlantic
for the sole purpose of taking him by the hand and looking into
his kind eyes once more before he should be called to his
rest.</p>

<p>We both thank you greatly for the Edinburgh papers which you
sent. My wife and I join in affectionate remembrances and
greetings to yourself and your aunt, and in the sincere tender of
our sympathies. Faithfully yours,</p>

<p>S. L. CLEMENS.</p>

<p>P.S. Our Susy is still "Megalopis." He gave her that name.</p>

<p>Can you spare us a photograph of your father? We have none but
the one taken in group with ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It was my fault that she never saw Doctor John in life again.
How many crimes I committed against that gentle and patient and
forgiving spirit! I always told her that if she died first, the
rest of my life would be made up of self-reproaches for the tears
I had made her shed. And she always replied that if I should pass
from life first, she would never have to reproach herself with
having loved me the less devotedly or the less constantly because
of those tears. We had this conversation again, and for the
thousandth time, when the night of death was closing about
her--though we did not suspect that.</p>

<p>In the letter last quoted above, I say, "Mrs. Clemens has
never ceased to express regret that we came away from England the
last time without going to see him." I think that that was
intended to convey the impression that <i>she</i> was a party
concerned in our leaving England without going to see him. It is
not so. She urged me, she begged me, she implored me to take her
to Edinburgh to see Doctor John--but I was in one of my devil
moods, and I would not do it. I would not do it because I should
have been obliged to continue the courier in service until we got
back to Liverpool. It seemed to me that I had endured him as long
as I could. I wanted to get aboard ship and be done with him. How
childish it all seems now! And how brutal--that I could not be
moved to confer upon my wife a precious and lasting joy because
it would cause me a small inconvenience. I have known few meaner
men than I am. By good fortune this feature of my nature does not
often get to the surface, and so I doubt if any member of my
family except my wife ever suspected how much of that feature
there was in me. I suppose it never failed to arrive at the
surface when there was opportunity, but it was as I have
said--the opportunities have been so infrequent that this worst
detail of my character has never been known to any but two
persons--Mrs. Clemens, who suffered from it, and I, who suffer
from the remembrance of the tears it caused her.</p>

<p><i>Some curious letter superscriptions which have come to Mr.
Clemens.--Our inefficient postal system under Postmaster-General
Key.--Reminiscences of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe.--Story of Rev.
Charlie Stowe's little boy.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>A good many years ago Mrs. Clemens used to keep as curiosities
some of the odd and strange superscriptions that decorated
letters that came to me from strangers in out-of-the-way corners
of the earth. One of these superscriptions was the work of Dr.
John Brown, and the letter must have been the first one he wrote
me after we came home from Europe in August or September, '74.
Evidently the Doctor was guessing at our address from memory, for
he made an amusing mess of it. The superscription was as
follows:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. S. L. CLEMENS.</p>

<p>(MARK TWAIN),</p>

<p>HARTFORD, N. Y.</p>

<p>NEAR BOSTON, U. S. A.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<center><img alt="0200561h-02.jpg (30K)" src="0200561h-images/0200561h-02.jpg" height=
"357" width="561"></center>

<p> </p>

<p>Now then comes a fact which is almost incredible, to wit: the
New York Post Office, which did not contain a single salaried
idiot who could not have stated promptly who the letter was for
and to what town it should go, actually sent that letter to a wee
little hamlet hidden away in the remotenesses of the vast State
of New York--for what reason? Because that lost and never
previously heard-of hamlet was named Hartford. The letter was
returned to the New York Post Office from that hamlet. It was
returned innocent of the suggestion, "Try Hartford, Connecticut,"
although the hamlet's postmaster knew quite well that that was
the Hartford the writer of the letter was seeking. Then the New
York Post Office opened the envelope, got Doctor John's address
out of it, then inclosed it in a fresh envelope and sent it back
to Edinburgh. Doctor John then got my address from Menzies, the
publisher, and sent the letter to me again. He also inclosed the
former envelope--the one that had had the adventures--and his
anger at our postal system was like the fury of an angel. He came
the nearest to being bitter and offensive than ever he came in
his life, I suppose. He said that in Great Britain it was the
postal department's boast that by no ingenuity could a man so
disguise and conceal a Smith or a Jones or a Robinson in a letter
address that the department couldn't find that man, whereas--then
he let fly at our system, which was apparently designed to defeat
a letter's attempts to get to its destination when humanly
possible.</p>

<p>Doctor John was right about our department--at that time. But
that time did not last long. I think Postmaster-General Key was
in office then. He was a new broom, and he did some astonishing
sweeping for a while. He made some cast-iron rules which worked
great havoc with the nation's correspondence. It did not occur to
him--rational things seldom occurred to him--that there were
several millions of people among us who seldom wrote letters; who
were utterly ignorant of postal rules, and who were quite sure to
make blunders in writing letter addresses whenever blunders were
possible, and that it was the government's business to do the
very best it could by the letters of these innocents and help
them get to their destinations, instead of inventing ways to
block the road. Key suddenly issued some boiler-iron rules--one
of them was that a letter must go to the place named on the
envelope, and the effort to find its man must stop there. He must
not be searched for. If he wasn't at the place indicated the
letter must be returned to the sender. In the case of Doctor
John's letter the Post Office had a wide discretion--not so very
wide, either. It must go to a Hartford. That Hartford must be
near Boston; it must also be in the State of New York. It went to
the Hartford that was farthest from Boston, but it filled the
requirement of being in the State of New York--and it got
defeated.</p>

<p>Another rule instituted by Key was that letter superscriptions
could not end with "Philadelphia"--or "Chicago," or "San
Francisco," or "Boston," or "New York," but, in every case, must
add the <i>state</i>, or go to the Dead Letter Office. Also, you
could not say "New York, N. Y.," you must add the word
<i>City</i> to the first "New York" or the letter must go to the
Dead Letter Office.</p>

<p>During the first thirty days of the dominion of this singular
rule sixteen hundred thousand tons of letters, more or less, went
to the Dead Letter Office from the New York Post Office alone.
The Dead Letter Office could not contain them and they had to be
stacked up outside the building. There was not room outside the
building inside the city, so they were formed into a rampart
around the city; and if they had had it there during the Civil
War we should not have had so much trouble and uneasiness about
an invasion of Washington by the Confederate armies. They could
neither have climbed over or under that breastwork nor bored nor
blasted through it. Mr. Key was soon brought to a more rational
frame of mind.</p>

<p>Then a letter arrived for me inclosed in a fresh envelope. It
was from a village priest in Bohemia or Galicia, and was boldly
addressed:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARK TWAIN</p>

<p>SOMEWHERE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It had traveled over several European countries; it had met
with hospitality and with every possible assistance during its
wide journey; it was ringed all over, on both sides, with a
chain-mail mesh of postmarks--there were nineteen of them
altogether. And one of them was a New York postmark. The postal
hospitalities had ceased at New York--within three hours and a
half of my home. There the letter had been opened, the priest's
address ascertained, and the letter had then been returned to
him, as in the case of Dr. John Brown.</p>

<p>Among Mrs. Clemens's collection of odd addresses was one on a
letter from Australia, worded thus:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARK TWAIN</p>

<p>GOD KNOWS WHERE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That superscription was noted by newspapers<sup>1</sup> here
and there and yonder while it was on its travels, and doubtless
suggested another odd superscription invented by some stranger in
a far-off land--and this was the wording of it:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARK TWAIN,</p>

<p>SOMEWHERE,</p>

<p>(TRY SATAN).</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> This letter was originally mailed in New
York by Brander Matthews and Francis Wilson.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>That stranger's trust was not misplaced. Satan courteously
sent it along.</p>

<p>This morning's mail brings another of these novelties. It
comes from France--from a young English girl--and is
addressed:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARK TWAIN,</p>

<p>C/O PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT,</p>

<p>THE WHITE HOUSE,</p>

<p>WASHINGTON,</p>

<p>AMERICA, U. S. A.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It was not delayed, but came straight along bearing the
Washington postmark of yesterday.</p>

<p>In a diary which Mrs. Clemens kept for a little while, a great
many years ago, I find various mentions of Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, who was a near neighbor of ours in Hartford, with no
fences between. And in those days she made as much use of our
grounds as of her own, in pleasant weather. Her mind had decayed
and she was a pathetic figure. She wandered about all the day
long in the care of a muscular Irishwoman. Among the colonists of
our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather.
Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was
always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she
was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it. She would
slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and
fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.
And she had other moods. Sometimes we would hear gentle music in
the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing
ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.</p>

<p>Her husband, old Professor Stowe, was a picturesque figure. He
wore a broad slouch hat. He was a large man, and solemn. His
beard was white and thick and hung far down on his breast. His
nose was enlarged and broken up by a disease which made it look
like a cauliflower. The first time our little Susy ever saw him
she encountered him on the street near our house and came flying
wide-eyed to her mother and said, "Santa Claus has got
loose."</p>

<h3>BABY ADVICE IN A CAR</h3>
</center>

<center>
<p>OLD MAN GOT IT, FIVE-YEAR-OLD GAVE IT,<br>
 MOTHER SAID, "SHUT UP"</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A benevolent-looking old man clung to a strap in a crowded
Broadway car bound uptown Saturday afternoon. In a corner seat in
front of him huddled a weak-looking little woman who clasped a
baby to her breast. Beside her sat another child, a girl perhaps
five years old, who seemed to be attracted by the old man's
kindly face, for she gazed at him and the baby with her bright,
intelligent eyes opened wide. He smiled at her interest and said
to her:</p>

<p>"My! What a nice baby! Just such a one as I was looking for, I
am going to take it."</p>

<p>"You can't," declared the little girl, quickly. "She's my
sister."</p>

<p>"What! Won't you give her to me?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't."</p>

<p>"But," he insisted, and there was real wistfulness in his
tones, "I haven't a baby in my home."</p>

<p>"Then write to God. He'll send you one," said the child
confidently,</p>

<p>The old man laughed. So did the other passengers. But the
mother evidently scented blasphemy.</p>

<p>"Tillie," said she, "shut up and behave yourself!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That is a scrap which I have cut from this morning's
<i>Times.</i> It is very prettily done, charmingly done; done
with admirable ease and grace--with the ease and grace that are
born of feeling and sympathy, as well as of practice with the
pen. Every now and then a newspaper reporter astonishes me with
felicities like this. I was a newspaper reporter myself
forty-four years ago, and during three subsequent years--but as I
remember it I and my comrades never had time to cast our things
in a fine literary mold. That scrap will be just as touching and
just as beautiful three hundred years hence as it is now.</p>

<p>I intend that this autobiography shall become a model for all
future autobiographies when it is published, after my death, and
I also intend that it shall be read and admired a good many
centuries because of its form and method--a form and method
whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to
face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all
along like contact of flint with steel. Moreover, this
autobiography of mine does not select from my life its showy
episodes, but deals merely in the common experiences which go to
make up the life of the average human being, and the narrative
must interest the average human being because these episodes are
of a sort which he is familiar with in his own life, and in which
he sees his own life reflected and set down in print. The usual,
conventional autobiographer seems to particularly hunt out those
occasions in his career when he came into contact with celebrated
persons, whereas his contacts with the uncelebrated were just as
interesting to him, and would be to his reader, and were vastly
more numerous than his collisions with the famous.</p>

<p>Howells was here yesterday afternoon, and I told him the whole
scheme of this autobiography and its apparently systemless
system--only apparently systemless, for it is not that. It is a
deliberate system, and the law of the system is that I shall talk
about the matter which for the moment interests me, and cast it
aside and talk about something else the moment its interest for
me is exhausted. It is a system which follows no charted course
and is not going to follow any such course. It is a system which
is a complete and purposed jumble--a course which begins nowhere,
follows no specified route, and can never reach an end while I am
alive, for the reason that it I should talk to the stenographer
two hours a day for a hundred years, I should still never be able
to set down a tenth part of the things which have interested me
in my lifetime. I told Howells that this autobiography of mine
would live a couple of thousand years without any effort and
would then take a fresh start and live the rest of the time.</p>

<p>He said he believed it would, and asked me if I meant to make
a library of it.</p>

<p>I said that that was my design, but that if I should live long
enough the set of volumes could not be contained merely in a
city, it would require a state, and that there would not be any
multi-billionaire alive, perhaps, at any time during its
existence who would be able to buy a full set, except on the
installment plan.</p>

<p>Howells applauded, and was full of praises and indorsement,
which was wise in him and judicious. If he had manifested a
different spirit I would have thrown him out of the window. I
like criticism, but it must be my way.</p>

<p>Day before yesterday there was another of those happy literary
efforts of the reporters, and I meant to cut it out and insert it
to be read with a sad pleasure in future centuries, but I forgot
and threw the paper away. It was a brief narrative, but well
stated. A poor little starved girl of sixteen, clothed in a
single garment, in midwinter (albeit properly speaking this is
spring), was brought in her pendent rags before a magistrate by a
policeman, and the charge against her was that she had been found
trying to commit suicide. The judge asked her why she was moved
to that crime, and she told him, in a low voice broken by sobs,
that her life had become a burden which she could no longer bear;
that she worked sixteen hours a day in a sweat shop; that the
meager wage she earned had to go toward the family support; that
her parents were never able to give her any clothes or enough to
eat; that she had worn this same ruined garment as long back as
she could remember; that her poor companions were her envy
because often they had a penny to spend for some pretty trifle
for themselves; that she could not remember when she had had a
penny for such a purpose. The court, the policemen, and the other
spectators cried with her--a sufficient proof that she told her
pitiful tale convincingly and well. And the fact that I also was
moved by it, at second hand, is proof that that reporter
delivered it from his heart through his pen, and did his work
well.</p>

<p>In the remote parts of the country the weekly village
newspaper remains the same curious production it was when I was a
boy, sixty years ago, on the banks of the Mississippi. The
metropolitan daily of the great city tells us every day about the
movements of Lieutenant-General So-and-so and Rear-Admiral
So-and-so, and what the Vanderbilts are doing. These great
dailies keep us informed of Mr. Carnegie's movements and sayings;
they tell us what President Roosevelt said yesterday and what he
is going to do to-day. They tell us what the children of his
family have been saying, just as the princelings of Europe are
daily quoted--and we notice that the remarks of the Roosevelt
children are distinctly princely in that the things they say are
rather notably not worth while.</p>

<p>Now the court circular of the remote village newspaper has
always dealt, during these sixty years, with the comings and
goings and sayings of <i>its</i> local princelings. They have
told us during all those years, and they still tell us, what the
principal grocery man is doing and how he has bought a new stock;
they tell us that relatives are visiting the ice-cream man, that
Miss Smith has arrived to spend a week with the Joneses, and so
on, and so on. And all that record is just as intensely
interesting to the villagers as is the record I have just been
speaking of, of the doings and sayings of the colossally
conspicuous personages of the United States. This shows that
human nature is all alike; it shows that we like to know what the
big people are doing, so that we can envy them. It shows that the
big personage of a village bears the same proportion to the
little people of the village that the President of the United
States bears to the nation. It shows that <i>conspicuousness</i>
is the only thing necessary in a person to command our interest
and, in a larger or smaller sense, our worship. We recognize that
there are <i>no</i> trivial occurrences in life if we get the
right focus on them. In a village they are just as prodigious as
they are when the subject is a personage of national
importance.</p>

<h3>CAPT. E. L. MARSH</h3>
</center>

<center>
<h4>FORMER ELMIRAN WHO DIED AT DES MOINES, IOWA, RECENTLY</h4>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p>Captain E. L. Marsh, aged sixty-four years, died at Des
Moines, Iowa, a week ago Friday--February 23--after a long
illness. The deceased was born in Enfield, Tompkins county, N.
Y., in 1842, later came to Elmira to live with his parents and in
1857 left Elmira to locate in Iowa, where he has lived the
greater part of the time since, the only exception being brief
times of residence in the south and east. He enlisted in Company
D, of the Second Iowa at Des Moines, and was elected a captain in
that regiment. He served throughout the war with marked courage
and efficiency. After the war Captain Marsh went to New Orleans,
where he remained during most of the reconstruction period and
then went to New York, where he engaged in paving business for
several years. He went back to Des Moines in 1877 and resided
there during the almost thirty years since. He engaged in the
real estate business there with great success. He was married in
1873 and is survived by his wife and two children. Captain Marsh
was a member of the Loyal Legion, Commandery of Iowa, and was
senior vice commander of the order for Iowa. He was a member of
the G. A. R., also, and a member of the Congregational church.
Captain Marsh was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Sheppard Marsh, and
Mrs. Marsh was twin sister of the late Mrs. Jervis Langdon of
this city. Captain Marsh was a very dear and close friend of his
cousin, General Charles J. Langdon, of Elmira.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>This clipping from a Des Moines, Iowa, newspaper arrives this
morning. Ed Marsh was a cousin of my wife, and I remember him
very well. He was present at our wedding thirty-six years ago,
and was a handsome young bachelor. Aside from my interest in him
as a cousin of my young bride, he had another interest for me in
the fact that in his company of the Second Iowa Infantry was Dick
Higham. Five years before the war, Dick, a good-natured,
simple-minded, winning lad of seventeen, was an apprentice in my
brother's small printing-office in Keokuk, Iowa. He had an old
musket and he used to parade up and down with it in the office,
and he said he would rather be a soldier than anything else. The
rest of us laughed at him and said he was nothing but a disguised
girl, and that if he were confronted by the enemy he would drop
his gun and run.</p>

<p>But we were not good prophets. By and by when President
Lincoln called for volunteers Dick joined the Second Iowa
Infantry, about the time that I was thrown out of my employment
as Mississippi River pilot and was preparing to become an
imitation soldier on the Confederate side in Rails County,
Missouri. The Second Iowa was moved down to the neighborhood of
St. Louis and went into camp there. In some way or other it
disgraced itself--and if I remember rightly the punishment
decreed was that it should never unfurl its flag again until it
won the privilege by gallantry in battle. When General Grant, by
and by--February, '62--was ordering the charge upon Fort
Donelson, the Second Iowa begged for the privilege of leading the
assault, and got it. Ed Marsh's company, with Dick in it serving
as a private soldier, moved up the hill and through and over the
felled trees and other obstructions in the forefront of the
charge, and Dick fell with a bullet through the center of his
forehead--thus manfully wiping from the slate the chaffing
prophecy of five or six years before. Also, what was left of the
Second Iowa finished that charge victorious, with its colors
flying and never more to be furled in disgrace.</p>

<p>Ed Marsh's sister also was at our wedding. She and her brother
bore for each other an almost idolatrous love, and this endured
until about a year ago. About the time of our marriage that
sister married a blatherskite by the name of Talmage Brown. He
was a smart man and intemperately religious. Through his
smartness he acquired a large fortune, and in his will, made
shortly before his death, he appointed Ed Marsh as one of the
executors. The estate was worth a million dollars or more, but
its affairs were in a very confused condition. Ed Marsh and the
other one or two executors performed their duty faithfully, and
without remuneration. It took them years to straighten out the
estate's affairs, but they accomplished it. During the succeeding
years all went pleasantly. But at last, about a year ago, some
relatives of the late Talmage Brown persuaded the widow to bring
suit against Ed Marsh and his fellow executors for a large sum of
money which it was pretended they had either stolen or had wasted
by mismanagement. That severed the devoted relationship which had
existed between the brother and sister throughout their lives.
The mere bringing of the suit broke Ed Marsh's heart, for he was
a thoroughly honorable man and could not bear even the breath of
suspicion. He took to his bed and the case went to court. He had
no word of blame for his sister, and said that no one was to
blame but the Browns. They had poisoned her mind. The case was
heard in court. Then the judge threw it out with many indignant
comments. But the news of the rehabilitation reached Marsh too
late to save him. He did not rally. He has been losing ground
gradually for the past two months, and now at last the end has
come.</p>

<p>This morning arrives a letter from my ancient silver-mining
comrade, Calvin H. Higbie, a man whom I have not seen nor had
communication with for forty-four years. Higbie figures in a
chapter of mine in <i>Roughing It,</i> where the tale is told of
how we discovered a rich blind lead in the Wide West Mine in
Aurora--or, as we called that region then, Esmeralda---and how,
instead of making our ownership of that exceedingly rich property
permanent by doing ten days' work on it, as required by the
mining laws, he went off on a wild-goose chase to hunt for the
mysterious cement mine; and how I went off nine miles to Walker
River to nurse Captain John Nye through a violent case of
spasmodic rheumatism or blind staggers, or some malady of the
kind; and how Cal and I came wandering back into Esmeralda one
night just in time to be too late to save our fortune from the
jumpers.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p> </p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> <i>Roughing It</i> is dedicated to
Higbie.</small></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I will insert here this letter, and as it will not see the
light until Higbie and I are in our graves, I shall allow myself
the privilege of copying his punctuation and his spelling, for to
me they are a part of the man. He is as honest as the day is
long. He is utterly simple-minded and straightforward, and his
spelling and his punctuation are as simple and honest as he is
himself. He makes no apology for them, and no apology is needed.
They plainly state that he is not educated, and they as plainly
state that he makes no pretense to being educated.</p>

<p>MY DEAR SIR--</p>

<p>Two or three parties have ben after me to write up my
recolections of Our associations in Nevada, in the early 60's and
have come to the conclusion to do so, and have ben jocting down
incidents that came to mind, for several years. What I am in dout
is, the date you came to Aurora, Nevada- allso, the first trip
you made over thee Sieras to California, after coming to Nev.
allso as near as possable date, you tended sick man, on, or near
Walker River, when our mine was jumped, dont think for a moment
that I intend to steal any of your Thunder, but onely to mention
some instances that you failed to mention, in any of your
articles, Books &amp;c. that I ever saw. I intend to submit the
articles to you so that you can see if anything is objectionabl,
if so to erase, same, &amp; add anything in its place you saw
fit.</p>

<p>I was burned out a few years since, and all old data, went up
in smoke, is the reason I ask for above dates, have ben sick more
or less for 2 or 3 years, unable to earn anything to speak of,
&amp; the finances are getting pretty low, and I will admit that
it is mainly for the purpose of Earning a little money, that my
first attempt at writing will be made- and I should be so pleased
to have your candid opinion, of its merits, and what in your
wisdom in such matters, would be its value for publication. I
enclose a coppy of Herald in answer to enquiry I made, if such an
article was desired.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear from you as soon as convenient, I remain with
great respect,</p>

<p>I have written Higbie and asked him to let me do his literary
trading for him. He can shovel sand better than I can--as will
appear in the next chapter--but I can beat him all to pieces in
the art of fleecing a publisher.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 27, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Higbie's spelling.--Mr. Clemens's scheme for getting Higbie
a job at the Pioneer.--In 1863 Mr. Clemens goes to Virginia City
to be sole reporter on "Territorial Enterprise."--Mr. Clemens
tries his scheme for finding employment for the unemployed, on a
young St. Louis reporter, with great success. Also worked the
scheme for his nephew, Mr. Samuel E. Moffett.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I have allowed Higbie to assist the <i>Herald</i> man's
spelling and make it harmonize with his own. He has done it well
and liberally and without prejudice.</p>

<p>To my mind he has improved it, for I have had an aversion to
good spelling for sixty years and more, merely for the reason
that when I was a boy there was not a thing I could do creditably
except spell according to the book. It was a poor and mean
distinction, and I early learned to disenjoy it. I suppose that
this is because the ability to spell correctly is a talent, not
an acquirement. There is some dignity about an acquirement,
because it is a product of your own labor. It is wages earned,
whereas to be able to do a thing merely by the grace of God, and
not by your own effort, transfers the distinction to our heavenly
home--where possibly it is a matter of pride and satisfaction,
but it leaves you naked and bankrupt.</p>

<p>Higbie was the first person to profit by my great and
infallible scheme for finding work for the unemployed. I have
tried that scheme, now and then, for forty-four years. So far as
I am aware it has always succeeded, and it is one of my high
prides that I invented it, and that in basing it upon what I
conceived to be a fact of human nature I estimated that fact of
human nature accurately.</p>

<p>Higbie and I were living in a cotton-domestic lean-to at the
base of a mountain. It was very cramped quarters, with barely
room for us and the stove--wretched quarters, indeed, for every
now and then, between eight in the morning and eight in the
evening, the thermometer would make an excursion of fifty
degrees. We had a silver-mining claim under the edge of a hill
half a mile away, in partnership with Bob Howland and Horatio
Phillips, and we used to go there every morning, carrying with us
our luncheon, and remain all day picking and blasting in our
shaft, hoping, despairing, hoping again, and gradually but surely
running out of funds. At last, when we were clear out and still
had struck nothing, we saw that we must find some other way of
earning a living. I secured a place in a near-by quartz mill to
screen sand with a long-handled shovel. I hate a long-handled
shovel. I never could learn to swing it properly. As often as any
other way the sand didn't reach the screen at all, but went over
my head and down my back, inside of my clothes. It was the most
detestable work I have ever engaged in, but it paid ten dollars a
week and board--and the board was worth while, because it
consisted not only of bacon, beans, coffee, bread, and molasses,
but we had stewed dried apples every day in the week just the
same as if it were Sunday. But this palatial life, this gross and
luxurious life, had to come to an end, and there were two
sufficient reasons for it. On my side, I could not endure the
heavy labor; and on the company's side, they did not feel
justified in paying me to shovel sand down my back; so I was
discharged just at the moment that I was going to resign.</p>

<p>If Higbie had taken that job all would have been well and
everybody satisfied, for his great frame would have been
competent. He was muscled like a giant. He could handle a
long-handled shovel like an emperor, and he could work patiently
and contentedly twelve hours on a stretch without ever hastening
his pulse or his breath. Meantime, he had found nothing to do,
and was somewhat discouraged. He said, with an outburst of
pathetic longing, "If I could only get a job at the Pioneer!"</p>

<p>I said, "What kind of a job do you want at the Pioneer?"</p>

<p>He said, "Why, laborer. They get five dollars a day."</p>

<p>I said, "If that's all you want I can arrange it for you."</p>

<p>Higbie was astonished. He said, "Do you mean to say that you
know the foreman there and could get me a job and yet have never
said anything about it?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I don't know the foreman."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "who is it you know? How is it you can get me
the job?"</p>

<p>"Why," I said, "that's perfectly simple. If you will do as I
tell you to do, and don't try to improve on my instructions, you
shall have the job before night."</p>

<p>He said, eagerly, "I'll obey the instructions, I don't care
what they are."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "go there and say that you want work as a
laborer; that you are tired of being idle; that you are not used
to being idle, and can't stand it; that you just merely want the
refreshment of work and require nothing in return."</p>

<p>He said, "Nothing?"</p>

<p>I said, "That's it--nothing."</p>

<p>"No wages at all?"</p>

<p>"No, no wages at all."</p>

<p>"Not even board?"</p>

<p>"No, not even board. You are to work for nothing. Make them
understand that--that you are perfectly willing to work for
nothing. When they look at that figure of yours that foreman will
understand that he has drawn a prize. You'll get the job."</p>

<p>Higbie said, indignantly, "Yes, a hell of a job."</p>

<p>I said: "You said you were going to do it, and now you are
already criticizing. You have said you would obey my
instructions. You are always as good as your word. Clear out,
now, and get the job."</p>

<p>He said he would.</p>

<p>I was pretty anxious to know what was going to happen--more
anxious than I would have wanted him to find out. I preferred to
seem entirely confident of the strength of my scheme, and I made
good show of that confidence. But really I was very anxious. Yet
I believed that I knew enough of human nature to know that a man
like Higbie would not be flung out of that place without
reflection when he was offering those muscles of his for nothing.
The hours dragged along and he didn't return. I began to feel
better and better. I began to accumulate confidence. At sundown
he did at last arrive and I had the joy of knowing that my
invention had been a fine inspiration and was successful.</p>

<p>He said the foreman was so astonished at first that he didn't
know how to take hold of the proposition, but that he soon
recovered and was evidently very glad that he was able to
accommodate Higbie and furnish him the refreshment he was pining
for.</p>

<p>Higbie said, "How long is this to go on?"</p>

<p>I said: "The terms are that you are to stay right there; do
your work just as if you were getting the going wages for it. You
are never to make any complaint; you are never to indicate that
you would like to have wages or board. This will go on one, two,
three, four, five, six days, according to the make of that
foreman. Some foremen would break down under the strain in a
couple of days. There are others who would last a week. It would
be difficult to find one who could stand out a whole fortnight
without getting ashamed of himself and offering you wages. Now
let's suppose that this is a fortnight foreman. In that case you
will not be there a fortnight. Because the men will spread it
around that the very ablest laborer in this camp is so fond of
work that he is willing and glad to do it without pay. You will
be regarded as the latest curiosity. Men will come from the other
mills to have a look at you. You could charge admission and get
it, but you mustn't do that. Stick to your colors. When the
foremen of the other mills cast their eyes upon this bulk of
yours and perceive that you are worth two ordinary men they'll
offer you half a man's wages. You are not to accept until you
report to your foreman. Give him an opportunity to offer you the
same. If he doesn't do it, then you are free to take up with that
other man's offer. Higbie, you'll be foreman of a mine or a mill
inside of three weeks, and at the best wages going."</p>

<p>It turned out just so--and after that I led an easy life, with
nothing to do, for it did not occur to me to take my own
medicine. I didn't want a job as long as Higbie had one. One was
enough for so small a family--and so during many succeeding weeks
I was a gentleman of leisure, with books and newspapers to read
and stewed dried apples every day for dinner the same as Sunday,
and I wanted no better career than this in this life. Higbie
supported me handsomely, never once complained of it, never once
suggested that I go out and try for a job at no wages and keep
myself.</p>

<p>That would be in 1862. I parted from Higbie about the end of
'62--or possibly it could have been the beginning of '63--and
went to Virginia City, for I had been invited to come there and
take William H. Wright's place as sole reporter on the
<i>Territorial Enterprise</i> and do Wright's work for three
months while he crossed the plains to Iowa to visit his family.
However, I have told all about this in <i>Roughing It.</i></p>

<p>I have never seen Higbie since, in all these forty-four
years.</p>

<p>Shortly after my marriage, in 1870, I received a letter from a
young man in St. Louis who was possibly a distant relative of
mine--I don't remember now about that--but his letter said that
he was anxious and ambitious to become a journalist--and would I
send him a letter of introduction to some St. Louis newspaper and
make an effort to get him a place as a reporter? It was the first
time I had had an opportunity to make a new trial of my great
scheme. I wrote him and said I would get him a place on any
newspaper in St. Louis; he could choose the one he preferred, but
he must promise me to faithfully follow out the instructions
which I should give him. He replied that he would follow out
those instructions to the letter and with enthusiasm. His letter
was overflowing with gratitude--premature gratitude. He asked for
the instructions. I sent them. I said he must not use a letter of
introduction from me or from anyone else. He must go to the
newspaper of his choice and say that he was idle, and weary of
being idle, and wanted work--that he was pining for work, longing
for work--that he didn't care for wages, didn't want wages, but
would support himself; he wanted work, nothing but work, and not
work of a particular kind, but any kind of work they would give
him to do. He would sweep out the editorial rooms; he would keep
the inkstands full, and the mucilage bottles; he would run
errands; he would make himself useful in every way he could.</p>

<p>I suspected that my scheme would not work with everybody--that
some people would scorn to labor for nothing and would think it
matter for self-contempt; also that many persons would think me a
fool to suggest such a project; also that many persons would not
have character enough to go into the scheme in a determined way
and test it. I was interested to know what kind of a candidate
this one was, but of course I had to wait some time to find out.
I had told him he must never ask for wages; he must never be
beguiled into making that mistake; that sooner or later an offer
of wages would come from somewhere, and in that case he must go
straight to his employer and give him the opportunity to offer
him the like wages, in which case he must stay where he was--that
as long as he was in anybody's employ he must never ask for an
advance of wages; that would always come from somewhere else if
he proved his worthiness.</p>

<p>The scheme worked again. That young fellow chose his paper,
and during the first few days he did the sweeping out and other
humble work, and kept his mouth shut. After that the staff began
to take notice of him. They saw that they could employ him in
lots of ways that saved time and effort for them at no expense.
They found that he was alert and willing. They began presently to
widen his usefulness. Then he ventured to risk another detail of
my instructions; I had told him not to be in a hurry about it,
but to make his popularity secure first. He took up that detail
now. When he was on his road between office and home, and when he
was out on errands, he kept his eyes open, and whenever he saw
anything that could be useful in the local columns he wrote it
out, then went over it and abolished adjectives, went over it
again and extinguished other surplusages, and finally when he got
it boiled down to the plain facts with the ruffles and other
embroideries all gone, he laid it on the city editor's desk. He
scored several successes, and saw his stuff go into the paper
unpruned. Presently the city editor when short of help sent him
out on an assignment. He did his best with it, and with good
results. This happened with more and more frequency. It brought
him into contact with all the reporters of all the newspapers. He
made friends with them and presently one of them told him of a
berth that was vacant, and that he could get it and the wages
too. He said he must see his own employers first about it. In
strict accordance with my instructions he carried the offer to
his own employers, and the thing happened which was to be
expected. They said they could pay that wage as well as any other
newspaper--stay where he was.</p>

<p>This young man wrote me two or three times a year and he
always had something freshly encouraging to report about my
scheme. Now and then he would be offered a raise by another
newspaper. He carried the news to his own paper; his own paper
stood the raise every time and he remained there. Finally he got
an offer which his employers could not meet and then they parted.
This offer was a salary of three thousand a year, to be managing
editor on a daily in a Southern city of considerable importance,
and it was a large wage for that day and region. He held that
post three years. After that I never heard of him any more.</p>

<p>About 1886 my nephew, Samuel E. Moffett, a youth in the
twenties, lost his inherited property and found himself obliged
to hunt for something to do by way of making a living. He was an
extraordinary young fellow in several ways. A nervous malady had
early unfitted him for attending school in any regular way, and
he had come up without a school education--but this was no great
harm for him, for he had a prodigious memory and a powerful
thirst for knowledge. At twelve years he had picked up, through
reading and listening, a large and varied treasury of knowledge,
and I remember one exhibition of it which was very offensive to
me. He was visiting in our house and I was trying to build a game
out of historical facts drawn from all the ages. I had put in a
good deal of labor on this game, and it was hard labor, for the
facts were not in my head. I had to dig them painfully out of the
books. The boy looked over my work, found that my facts were not
accurate and the game, as it stood, not usable. Then he sat down
and built the whole game out of his memory. To me it was a
wonderful performance, and I was deeply offended.</p>

<p>As I have said, he wrote me from San Francisco in his early
twenties, and said he wanted to become a journalist, and would I
send him some letters of introduction to the newspaper editors of
that city? I wrote back and put him strictly under those same old
instructions. I sent him no letter of introduction and forbade
him to use one furnished by anybody else. He followed the
instructions strictly. He went to work in the <i>Examiner,</i> a
property of William R. Hearst. He cleaned out the editorial rooms
and carried on the customary drudgeries required by my scheme. In
a little while he was on the editorial staff at a good salary.
After two or three years the salary was raised to a very good
figure indeed. After another year or two he handed in his
resignation--for in the meantime he had married and was living in
Oakland, or one of those suburbs, and did not like the travel to
and fro between the newspaper and his home in the late hours of
the night and the morning. Then he was told to stay in Oakland,
write his editorials there and send them over, and the large
salary was continued. By and by he was brought to New York to
serve on Mr. Hearst's New York paper, and when he finally
resigned from that employment he had been in Mr. Hearst's employ
sixteen years without a break. Then he became an editorial writer
on the New York <i>World</i> with the privilege of living out of
town and sending his matter in. His wage was eight thousand
dollars a year. A couple of years ago <i>Collier's Weekly</i>
offered him an easy berth and one which was particularly
desirable in his case, since it would deal mainly with historical
matters, past and present--and that was an industry which he
liked. The salary was to be ten thousand dollars. He came to me
for advice, and I told him to accept, which he did. When Mr.
Pulitzer found that he was gone from the <i>World</i> he was not
pleased with his managing editor for letting him go, but his
managing editor was not to blame. He didn't know that Moffett was
going until he received his resignation. Pulitzer offered Moffett
a billet for twenty years, this term to be secured in such a way
that it could not be endangered by Pulitzer's death, and to this
offer was added the extraordinary proposition that Moffett could
name his own salary. But of course Moffett remains with Collier,
his agreement with <i>Collier's</i> having been already arrived
at satisfactorily to both parties.</p>

<p><i>Orion Clemens's personality.--His adventure at the house of
Doctor Meredith.--Death of Mr. Clemens's father, just after
having been made county judge.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>My brother's experience was another conspicuous example of my
scheme's efficiency. I will talk about that by and by. But for
the moment my interest suddenly centers itself upon his
personality, moved thereto by this passing mention of him--and so
I will drop other matters and sketch that personality. It is a
very curious one. In all my seventy years I have not met the twin
of it.</p>

<p>Orion Clemens was born in Jamestown, Fentress County,
Tennessee, in 1825. He was the family's first-born and antedated
me ten years. Between him and me came a sister, Margaret, who
died, aged nine, in 1839 in that village of Florida, Missouri,
where I was born; and Pamela, mother of Samuel E. Moffett, who
was an invalid all her life and died in the neighborhood of New
York a year ago, aged about seventy-five. Also there was a
brother, Benjamin, who died in 1842, aged ten.</p>

<p>Orion's boyhood was spent in that wee little log hamlet of
Jamestown up there among the knobs--so called--of East Tennessee,
among a very sparse population of primitives who were as ignorant
of the outside world and as unconscious of it as the other wild
animals were that inhabited the forest around. The family
migrated to Florida, Missouri, then moved to Hannibal, Missouri,
when Orion was ten years old. When he was fifteen or sixteen he
was sent to St. Louis and there he learned the printer's trade.
One of his characteristics was eagerness. He woke with an
eagerness about some matter or other every morning; it consumed
him all day; it perished in the night and he was on fire with a
fresh new interest next morning before he could get his clothes
on. He exploited in this way three hundred and sixty-five red-hot
new eagernesses every year of his life--until he died sitting at
a table with a pen in his hand, in the early morning, jotting
down the conflagration for that day and preparing to enjoy the
fire and smoke of it until night should extinguish it. He was
then seventy-two years old. But I am forgetting another
characteristic, a very pronounced one. That was his deep glooms,
his despondencies, his despairs; these had their place in each
and every day along with the eagernesses. Thus his day was
divided--no, not divided, mottled--from sunrise to midnight with
alternating brilliant sunshine and black cloud. Every day he was
the most joyous and hopeful man that ever was, I think, and also
every day he was the most miserable man that ever was.</p>

<p>While he was in his apprenticeship in St. Louis he got well
acquainted with Edward Bates, who was afterward in Mr. Lincoln's
first Cabinet. Bates was a very fine man, an honorable and
upright man, and a distinguished lawyer. He patiently allowed
Orion to bring to him each new project; he discussed it with him
and extinguished it by argument and irresistible logic--at first.
But after a few weeks he found that this labor was not necessary;
that he could leave the new project alone and it would extinguish
itself the same night. Orion thought he would like to become a
lawyer. Mr. Bates encouraged him, and he studied law nearly a
week, then of course laid it aside to try something new. He
wanted to become an orator. Mr. Bates gave him lessons. Mr. Bates
walked the floor reading from an English book aloud and rapidly
turning the English into French, and he recommended this exercise
to Orion. But as Orion knew no French, he took up that study and
wrought at it with enthusiasm two or three days; then gave it up.
During his apprenticeship in St. Louis he joined a number of
churches, one after another, and taught in the
Sunday-schools--changing his Sunday-school every time he changed
his religion. He was correspondingly erratic in his
politics--Whig to-day, Democrat next week, and anything fresh
that he could find in the political market the week after. I may
remark here that throughout his long life he was always trading
religions and enjoying the change of scenery. I will also remark
that his sincerity was never doubted; his truthfulness was never
doubted; and in matters of business and money his honesty was
never questioned. Notwithstanding his forever-recurring caprices
and changes, his principles were high, always high, and
absolutely unshakable. He was the strangest compound that ever
got mixed in a human mold. Such a person as that is given to
acting upon impulse and without reflection; that was Orion's way.
Everything he did he did with conviction and enthusiasm and with
a vainglorious pride in the thing he was doing--and no matter
what that thing was, whether good, bad, or indifferent, he
repented of it every time in sackcloth and ashes before
twenty-four hours had sped. Pessimists are born, not made.
Optimists are born, not made. But I think he was the only person
I have ever known in whom pessimism and optimism were lodged in
exactly equal proportions. Except in the matter of grounded
principle, he was as unstable as water. You could dash his
spirits with a single word; you could raise them into the sky
again with another one. You could break his heart with a word of
disapproval; you could make him as happy as an angel with a word
of approval. And there was no occasion to put any sense or any
vestige of mentality of any kind into these miracles; anything
you might say would answer.</p>

<p>He had another conspicuous characteristic, and it was the
father of those which I have just spoken of. This was an intense
lust for approval. He was so eager to be approved, so girlishly
anxious to be approved by anybody and everybody, without
discrimination, that he was commonly ready to forsake his
notions, opinions, and convictions at a moment's notice in order
to get the approval of any person who disagreed with them. I wish
to be understood as reserving his fundamental principles all the
time. He never forsook those to please anybody. Born and reared
among slaves and slaveholders, he was yet an abolitionist from
his boyhood to his death. He was always truthful; he was always
sincere; he was always honest and honorable. But in light
matters--matters of small consequence, like religion and politics
and such things--he never acquired a conviction that could
survive a disapproving remark from a cat.</p>

<p>He was always dreaming; he was a dreamer from birth, and this
characteristic got him into trouble now and then. Once when he
was twenty-three or twenty-four years old, and was become a
journeyman, he conceived the romantic idea of coming to Hannibal
without giving us notice, in order that he might furnish to the
family a pleasant surprise. If he had given notice, he would have
been informed that we had changed our residence and that that
gruff old bass-voiced sailorman, Doctor Meredith, our family
physician, was living in the house which we had formerly occupied
and that Orion's former room in that house was now occupied by
Doctor Meredith's two ripe old-maid sisters. Orion arrived at
Hannibal per steamboat in the middle of the night, and started
with his customary eagerness on his excursion, his mind all on
fire with his romantic project and building and enjoying his
surprise in advance. He was always enjoying things in advance; it
was the make of him. He never could wait for the event, but he
must build it out of dream-stuff and enjoy it
beforehand--consequently sometimes when the event happened he saw
that it was not as good as the one he had invented in his
imagination, and so he had lost profit by not keeping the
imaginary one and letting the reality go.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the house he went around to the back door
and slipped off his boots and crept upstairs and arrived at the
room of those old maids without having wakened any sleepers. He
undressed in the dark and got into bed and snuggled up against
somebody. He was a little surprised, but not much, for he thought
it was our brother Ben. It was winter, and the bed was
comfortable, and the supposed Ben added to the comfort--and so he
was dropping off to sleep very well satisfied with his progress
so far and full of happy dreams of what was going to happen in
the morning. But something else was going to happen sooner than
that, and it happened now. The old maid that was being crowded
squirmed and struggled and presently came to a half waking
condition and protested against the crowding. That voice
paralyzed Orion. He couldn't move a limb; he couldn't get his
breath; and the crowded one began to paw around, found Orion's
new whiskers, and screamed, "Why, it's a man!" This removed the
paralysis, and Orion was out of the bed and clawing around in the
dark for his clothes in a fraction of a second. Both maids began
to scream, so Orion did not wait to get his whole outfit. He
started with such parts of it as he could grab. He flew to the
head of the stairs and started down, and he was paralyzed again
at that point, because he saw the faint yellow flame of a candle
soaring up the stairs from below and he judged that Doctor
Meredith was behind it, and he was. He had no clothes on to speak
of, but no matter, he was well enough fixed for an occasion like
this, because he had a butcher knife in his hand. Orion shouted
to him, and this saved his life, for the doctor recognized his
voice. Then, in those deep sea-going bass tones of his that I
used to admire so much when I was a little boy, he explained to
Orion the change that had been made, told him where to find the
Clemens family, and closed with some quite unnecessary advice
about posting himself before he undertook another adventure like
that--advice which Orion probably never needed again as long as
he lived.</p>

<p>When my father died, in 1847, the disaster happened--as is the
customary way with such things--just at the very moment when our
fortunes had changed and we were about to be comfortable once
more, after several years of grinding poverty and privation which
had been inflicted upon us by the dishonest act of one Ira Stout,
to whom my father had lent several thousand dollars--a fortune in
those days and in that region. My father had just been elected
clerk of the Surrogate Court. This modest prosperity was not only
quite sufficient for us and for our ambitions, but he was so
esteemed--held in such high regard and honor throughout the
county--that his occupancy of that dignified office would, in the
opinion of everybody, be his possession as long as he might live.
He went to Palmyra, the county-seat, to be sworn in, about the
end of February. In returning home, horseback, twelve miles, a
storm of sleet and rain assailed him and he arrived at the house
in a half-frozen condition. Pleurisy followed and he died on the
24th of March.</p>

<p>Thus our splendid new fortune was snatched from us and we were
in the depths of poverty again. It is the way such things are
accustomed to happen.</p>

<p>The Clemens family was penniless again. Orion came to the
rescue.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Thursday, March 29, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens as apprentice to Mr. Ament.--Wilhelm H's
dinner, and the potato incident.--The printing of Rev. Alexander
Campbell's sermon.--Incident of dropping watermelon on Henry's
head.--Orion buys Hannibal "Journal," which is a failure--then he

pilot--starts with Orion for Nevada when Orion is made Secretary
to Territory of Nevada.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>But I am in error. Orion did not come to Hannibal until two or
three years after my father's death. He remained in St. Louis. He
was a journeyman printer and earning wages. Out of his wage he
supported my mother and my brother Henry, who was two years
younger than I. My sister Pamela helped in this support by taking
piano pupils. Thus we got along, but it was pretty hard sledding.
I was not one of the burdens, because I was taken from school at
once upon my father's death and placed in the office of the
Hannibal <i>Courier,</i> as printer's apprentice, and Mr. Ament,
the editor and proprietor of the paper, allowed me the usual
emolument of the office of apprentice--that is to say, board and
clothes, but no money. The clothes consisted of two suits a year,
but one of the suits always failed to materialize and the other
suit was not purchased so long as Mr. Ament's old clothes held
out. I was only about half as big as Ament, consequently his
shirts gave me the uncomfortable sense of living in a circus
tent, and I had to turn up his pants to my ears to make them
short enough.</p>

<p>There were two other apprentices. One was Wales McCormick,
seventeen or eighteen years old, and a giant. When he was in
Ament's clothes they fitted him as the candle mold fits the
candle--thus he was generally in a suffocated condition,
particularly in the summertime. He was a reckless, hilarious,
admirable creature; he had no principles and was delightful
company. At first we three apprentices had to feed in the kitchen
with the old slave cook and her very handsome and bright and
well-behaved young mulatto daughter. For his own amusement--for
he was not generally laboring for other people's amusement--Wales
was constantly and persistently and loudly and elaborately making
love to that mulatto girl and distressing the life out of her and
worrying the old mother to death. She would say, "Now, Marse
Wales, Marse Wales, can't you behave yourself?" With
encouragement like that, Wales would naturally renew his
attentions and emphasize them. It was killingly funny to Ralph
and me. And, to speak truly, the old mother's distress about it
was merely a pretense. She quite well understood that by the
customs of slaveholding communities it was Wales's right to make
love to that girl if he wanted to. But the girl's distress was
very real. She had a refined nature, and she took all Wales's
extravagant love-making in earnest.</p>

<p>We got but little variety in the way of food at that kitchen
table, and there wasn't enough of it, anyway. So we apprentices
used to keep alive by arts of our own--that is to say, we crept
into the cellar nearly every night, by a private entrance which
we had discovered, and we robbed the cellar of potatoes and
onions and such things, and carried them downtown to the
printing-office, where we slept on pallets on the floor, and
cooked them at the stove and had very good times. Wales had a
secret of cooking a potato which was noble and wonderful and all
his own. Since Wales's day I have seen a potato cooked in that
way only once. It was when Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany,
commanded my presence at a private feed toward the end of the
year 1891. And when that potato appeared on the table it
surprised me out of my discretion and made me commit the
unforgivable sin, before I could get a grip on my discretion
again--that is to say, I made a joyful exclamation of welcome
over the potato, addressing my remark to the Emperor at my side
without waiting for him to take the first innings. I think he
honestly tried to pretend that he was not shocked and outraged,
but he plainly was; and so were the other half-dozen grandees who
were present. They were all petrified, and nobody could have said
a word if he had tried. The ghastly silence endured for as much
as half a minute, and would have lasted until now, of course, if
the Emperor hadn't broken it himself, for no one else there would
have ventured that. It was at half past six in the evening, and
the frost did not get out of the atmosphere entirely until close
upon midnight, when it did finally melt away--or wash away--under
generous floods of beer.</p>

<p>As I have indicated, Mr. Ament's economies were of a pretty
close and rigid kind. By and by, when we apprentices were
promoted from the basement to the ground floor and allowed to sit
at the family table, along with the one journeyman, Pet
MacMurray, the economies continued. Mrs. Ament was a bride. She
had attained to that distinction very recently, after waiting a
good part of a lifetime for it, and she was the right woman in
the right place, according to the Amentian idea, for she did not
trust the sugar bowl to us, but sweetened our coffee herself.
That is, she went through the motions. She didn't really sweeten
it. She seemed to put one heaping teaspoonful of brown sugar into
each cup, but, according to Wales, that was a deceit. He said she
dipped the spoon in the coffee first to make the sugar stick, and
then scooped the sugar out of the bowl with the spoon upside
down, so that the effect to the eye was a heaped-up spoon,
whereas the sugar on it was nothing but a layer. This all seems
perfectly true to me, and yet that thing would be so difficult to
perform that I suppose it really didn't happen, but was one of
Wales's lies.</p>

<p>I have said that Wales was reckless, and he was. It was the
recklessness of ever-bubbling and indestructible good spirits
flowing from the joy of youth. I think there wasn't anything that
that vast boy wouldn't do to procure five minutes' entertainment
for himself. One never knew where he would break out next. Among
his shining characteristics was the most limitless and adorable
irreverence. There didn't seem to be anything serious in life for
him; there didn't seem to be anything that he revered.</p>

<p>Once the celebrated founder of the at that time new and
widespread sect called Campbellites arrived in our village from
Kentucky, and it made a prodigious excitement. The farmers and
their families drove or tramped into the village from miles
around to get a sight of the illustrious Alexander Campbell and
to have a chance to hear him preach. When he preached in a church
many had to be disappointed, for there was no church that would
begin to hold all the applicants; so in order to accommodate all,
he preached in the open air in the public square, and that was
the first time in my life that I had realized what a mighty
population this planet contains when you get them all
together.</p>

<p>He preached a sermon on one of these occasions which he had
written especially for that occasion. All the Campbellites wanted
it printed, so that they could save it and read it over and over
again, and get it by heart. So they drummed up sixteen dollars,
which was a large sum then, and for this great sum Mr. Ament
contracted to print five hundred copies of that sermon and put
them in yellow paper covers. It was a sixteen-page duodecimo
pamphlet, and it was a great event in our office. As we regarded
it, it was a book, and it promoted us to the dignity of book
printers. Moreover, no such mass of actual money as sixteen
dollars, in one bunch, had ever entered that office on any
previous occasion. People didn't pay for their paper and for
their advertising in money; they paid in dry-goods, sugar,
coffee, hickory wood, oak wood, turnips, pumpkins, onions,
watermelons--and it was very seldom indeed that a man paid in
money, and when that happened we thought there was something the
matter with him.</p>

<p>We set up the great book in pages--eight pages to a form--and
by help of a printer's manual we managed to get the pages in
their apparently crazy but really sane places on the
imposing-stone. We printed that form on a Thursday. Then we set
up the remaining eight pages, locked them into a form, and struck
a proof. Wales read the proof, and presently was aghast, for he
had struck a snag. And it was a bad time to strike a snag,
because it was Saturday; it was approaching noon; Saturday
afternoon was our holiday, and we wanted to get away and go
fishing. At such a time as this Wales struck that snag and showed
us what had happened. He had left out a couple of words in a
thin-spaced page of solid matter and there wasn't another
break-line for two or three pages ahead. What in the world was to
be done? Overrun all those pages in order to get in the two
missing words? Apparently there was no other way. It would take
an hour to do it. Then a revise must be sent to the great
minister; we must wait for him to read the revise; if he
encountered any errors we must correct them. It looked as if we
might lose half the afternoon before we could get away. Then
Wales had one of his brilliant ideas. In the line in which the
"out" had been made occurred the name Jesus Christ. Wales reduced
it in the French way to J. C. It made room for the missing words,
but it took 99 per cent of the solemnity out of a particularly
solemn sentence. We sent off the revise and waited. We were not
intending to wait long. In the circumstances we meant to get out
and go fishing before that revise should get back, but we were
not speedy enough. Presently that great Alexander Campbell
appeared at the far end of that sixty-foot room, and his
countenance cast a gloom over the whole place. He strode down to
our end and what he said was brief, but it was very stern, and it
was to the point. He read Wales a lecture. He said, "So long as
you live, don't you ever diminish the Saviour's name again. Put
it <i>all</i> in." He repeated this admonition a couple of times
to emphasize it, then he went away.</p>

<p>In that day the common swearers of the region had a way of
their own of <i>emphasizing</i> the Saviour's name when they were
using it profanely, and this fact intruded itself into Wales's
incorrigible mind. It offered him an opportunity for a momentary
entertainment which seemed to him to be more precious and more
valuable than even fishing and swimming could afford. So he
imposed upon himself the long and weary and dreary task of
overrunning all those three pages in order to improve upon his
former work and incidentally and thoughtfully improve upon the
great preacher's admonition. He enlarged the offending J. C. into
Jesus H. Christ. Wales knew that that would make prodigious
trouble, and it did. But it was not in him to resist it. He had
to succumb to the law of his make. I don't remember what his
punishment was, but he was not the person to care for that. He
had already collected his dividend.</p>

<p>It was during my first year's apprenticeship in the
<i>Courier</i> office that I did a thing which I have been trying
to regret for fifty-five years. It was a summer afternoon and
just the kind of weather that a boy prizes for river excursions
and other frolics, but I was a prisoner. The others were all gone
holidaying. I was alone and sad. I had committed a crime of some
sort and this was the punishment. I must lose my holiday, and
spend the afternoon in solitude besides. I had the
printing-office all to myself, there in the third story. I had
one comfort, and it was a generous one while it lasted. It was
the half of a long and broad watermelon, fresh and red and ripe.
I gouged it out with a knife, and I found accommodation for the
whole of it in my person--though it did crowd me until the juice
ran out of my ears. There remained then the shell, the hollow
shell. It was big enough to do duty as a cradle. I didn't want to
waste it, and I couldn't think of anything to do with it which
could afford entertainment. I was sitting at the open window
which looked out upon the sidewalk of the main street three
stories below, when it occurred to me to drop it on somebody's
head. I doubted the judiciousness of this, and I had some
compunctions about it, too, because so much of the resulting
entertainment would fall to my share and so little to the other
person. But I thought I would chance it. I watched out of the
window for the right person to come along--the safe person--but
he didn't come. Every time there was a candidate he or she turned
out to be an unsafe one, and I had to restrain myself. But at
last I saw the right one coming. It was my brother Henry. He was
the best boy in the whole region. He never did harm to anybody,
he never offended anybody. He was exasperatingly good. He had an
overflowing abundance of goodness--but not enough to save him
this time. I watched his approach with eager interest. He came
strolling along, dreaming his pleasant summer dream and not
doubting but that Providence had him in His care. If he had known
where I was he would have had less confidence in that
superstition. As he approached his form became more and more
foreshortened. When he was almost under me he was so
foreshortened that nothing of him was visible from my high place
except the end of his nose and his alternately approaching feet.
Then I poised the watermelon, calculated my distance, and let it
go, hollow side down. The accuracy of that gunnery was beyond
admiration. He had about six steps to make when I let that canoe
go, and it was lovely to see those two bodies gradually closing
in on each other. If he had had seven steps to make, or five
steps to make, my gunnery would have been a failure. But he had
exactly the right number to make, and that shell smashed down
right on the top of his head and drove him into the earth up to
the chin, the chunks of that broken melon flying in every
direction like a spray. I wanted to go down there and condole
with him, but it would not have been safe. He would have
suspected me at once. I expected him to suspect me, anyway, but
as he said nothing about this adventure for two or three days--I
was watching him in the meantime in order to keep out of
danger--I was deceived into believing that this time he didn't
suspect me. It was a mistake. He was only waiting for a sure
opportunity. Then he landed a cobblestone on the side of my head
which raised a bump there so large that I had to wear two hats
for a time. I carried this crime to my mother, for I was always
anxious to get Henry into trouble with her and could never
succeed. I thought that I had a sure case this time when she
should come to see that murderous bump. I showed it to her, but
she said it was no matter. She didn't need to inquire into the
circumstances. She knew I had deserved it, and the best way would
be for me to accept it as a valuable lesson, and thereby get
profit out of it.</p>

<p>About 1849 or 1850 Orion severed his connection with the
printing-house in St. Louis and came up to Hannibal and bought a
weekly paper called the Hannibal <i>Journal,</i> together with
its plant and its good-will, for the sum of five hundred dollars
cash. He borrowed the cash, at ten per cent interest, from an old
farmer named Johnson who lived five miles out of town. Then he
reduced the subscription price of the paper from two dollars to
one dollar. He reduced the rates for advertising in about the
same proportion, and thus he created one absolute and
unassailable certainty--to wit: that the business would never pay
him a single cent of profit. He took me out of the <i>Courier</i>
office and engaged my services in his own at three dollars and a
half a week, which was an extravagant wage, but Orion was always
generous, always liberal with everybody except himself. It cost
him nothing in my case, for he never was able to pay me a single
penny as long as I was with him. By the end of the first year he
found he must make some economies. The office rent was cheap, but
it was not cheap enough. He could not afford to pay rent of any
kind, so he moved the whole plant into the house we lived in, and
it cramped the dwelling-place cruelly. He kept that paper alive
during four years, but I have at this time no idea how he
accomplished it. Toward the end of each year he had to turn out
and scrape and scratch for the fifty dollars of interest due Mr.
Johnson, and that fifty dollars was about the only cash he ever
received or paid out, I suppose, while he was proprietor of that
newspaper, except for ink and printing-paper. The paper was a
dead failure. It had to be that from the start. Finally he handed
it over to Mr. Johnson, and went up to Muscatine, Iowa, and
acquired a small interest in a weekly newspaper there. It was not
a sort of property to marry on--but no matter. He came across a
winning and pretty girl who lived in Quincy, Illinois, a few
miles below Keokuk, and they became engaged. He was always
falling in love with girls, but by some accident or other he had
never gone so far as engagement before. And now he achieved
nothing but misfortune by it, because he straightway fell in love
with a Keokuk girl--at least he imagined that he was in love with
her, whereas I think she did the imagining for him. The first
thing he knew he was engaged to her; and he was in a great
quandary. He didn't know whether to marry the Keokuk one or the
Quincy one, or whether to try to marry both of them and suit
every one concerned. But the Keokuk girl soon settled that for
him. She was a master spirit and she ordered him to write the
Quincy girl and break off that match, which he did. Then he
married the Keokuk girl and they began a struggle for life which
turned out to be a difficult enterprise, and very
unpromising.</p>

<p>To gain a living in Muscatine was plainly impossible, so Orion
and his new wife went to Keokuk to live, for she wanted to be
near her relatives. He bought a little bit of a job-printing
plant--on credit, of course--and at once put prices down to where
not even the apprentices could get a living out of it, and this
sort of thing went on.</p>

<p>I had not joined the Muscatine migration. Just before that
happened (which I think was in 1853) I disappeared one night and
fled to St. Louis. There I worked in the composing-room of the
<i>Evening News</i> for a time, and then started on my travels to
see the world. The world was New York City, and there was a
little World's Fair there. It had just been opened where the
great reservoir afterward was, and where the sumptuous public
library is now being built--Fifth Avenue and 42d Street. I
arrived in New York with two or three dollars in pocket change
and a ten-dollar bank bill concealed in the lining of my coat. I
got work at villainous wages in the establishment of John A. Gray
&amp; Green in Cliff Street, and I found board in a sufficiently
villainous mechanics' boarding-house in Duane Street. The firm
paid my wages in wildcat money at its face value, and my week's
wage merely sufficed to pay board and lodging. By and by I went
to Philadelphia and worked there some months as a "sub" on the
<i>Inquirer</i> and the <i>Public Ledger.</i> Finally I made a
flying trip to Washington to see the sights there, and in 1854 I
went back to the Mississippi Valley, sitting upright in the
smoking-car two or three days and nights. When I reached St.
Louis I was exhausted. I went to bed on board a steamboat that
was bound for Muscatine. I fell asleep at once, with my clothes
on, and didn't wake again for thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>I worked in that little job office in Keokuk as much as two
years, I should say, without ever collecting a cent of wages, for
Orion was never able to pay anything--but Dick Higham and I had
good times. I don't know what Dick got, but it was probably only
uncashable promises.</p>

<p>One day in the midwinter of 1856 or 1857--I think it was
1856--I was coming along the main street of Keokuk in the middle
of the forenoon. It was bitter weather--so bitter that that
street was deserted, almost. A light dry snow was blowing here
and there on the ground and on the pavement, swirling this way
and that way and making all sorts of beautiful figures, but very
chilly to look at. The wind blew a piece of paper past me and it
lodged against a wall of a house. Something about the look of it
attracted my attention and I gathered it in. It was a
fifty-dollar bill, the only one I had ever seen, and the largest
assemblage of money I had ever seen in one spot. I advertised it
in the papers and suffered more than a thousand dollars' worth of
solicitude and fear and distress during the next few days lest
the owner should see the advertisement and come and take my
fortune away. As many as four days went by without an applicant;
then I could endure this kind of misery no longer.</p>

<p>I felt sure that another four could not go by in this safe and
secure way. I felt that I must take that money out of danger. So
I bought a ticket for Cincinnati and went to that city. I worked
there several months in the printing-office of Wrightson &amp;
Company. I had been reading Lieutenant Herndon's account of his
explorations of the Amazon and had been mightily attracted by
what he said of coca. I made up my mind that I would go to the
head-waters of the Amazon and collect coca and trade in it and
make a fortune. I left for New Orleans in the steamer <i>Paul
Jones</i> with this great idea filling my mind. One of the pilots
of that boat was Horace Bixby. Little by little I got acquainted
with him, and pretty soon I was doing a lot of steering for him
in his daylight watches. When I got to New Orleans I inquired
about ships leaving for Par&aacute; and discovered that there
weren't any, and learned that there probably wouldn't be any
during that century. It had not occurred to me to inquire about
these particulars before leaving Cincinnati, so there I was. I
couldn't get to the Amazon. I had no friends in New Orleans and
no money to speak of. I went to Horace Bixby and asked him to
make a pilot out of me. He said he would do it for five hundred
dollars, one hundred dollars cash in advance. So I steered for
him up to St. Louis, borrowed the money from my brother-in-law,
and closed the bargain. I had acquired this brother-in-law
several years before. This was Mr. William A. Moffett, a
merchant, a Virginian--a fine man in every way. He had married my
sister Pamela, and the Samuel E. Moffett of whom I have been
speaking was their son. Within eighteen months I was become a
competent pilot, and I served that office until the Mississippi
River traffic was brought to a standstill by the breaking out of
the Civil War.</p>

<p>Meantime Orion had been sweating along with his little job
office in Keokuk, and he and his wife were living with his wife's
family--ostensibly as boarders, but it is not likely that Orion
was ever able to pay the board. On account of charging nothing
for the work done in his job office, he had almost nothing to do
there. He was never able to get it through his head that work
done on a profitless basis deteriorates and is presently not
worth anything, and that customers are obliged to go where they
can get better work, even if they must pay better prices for it.
He had plenty of time, and he took up Blackstone again. He also
put up a sign which offered his services to the public as a
lawyer. He never got a case, in those days, nor even an
applicant, although he was quite willing to transact law business
for nothing and furnish the stationery himself. He was always
liberal that way.</p>

<p>Presently he moved to a wee little hamlet called Alexandria,
two or three miles down the river, and he put up that sign there.
He got no bites. He was by this time very hard aground. But by
this time I was beginning to earn a wage of two hundred and fifty
dollars a month as pilot, and so I supported him thenceforth
until 1861, when his ancient friend, Edward Bates, then a member
of Mr. Lincoln's first Cabinet, got him the place of Secretary of
the new Territory of Nevada, and Orion and I cleared for that
country in the overland stagecoach, I paying the fares, which
were pretty heavy, and carrying with me what money I had been
able to save--this was eight hundred dollars, I should say--and
it was all in silver coin and a good deal of a nuisance because
of its weight. And we had another nuisance, which was an
Unabridged Dictionary. It weighed about a thousand pounds, and
was a ruinous expense, because the stagecoach company charged for
extra baggage by the ounce. We could have kept a family for a
time on what that dictionary cost in the way of extra
freight--and it wasn't a good dictionary, anyway--didn't have any
modern words in it--only had obsolete ones that they used to use
when Noah Webster was a child.</p>

<p><i>Friday, March 30, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens's interview with Tchaykoffsky.--Presides at a
meeting of the association formed in interest of the adult
blind.--His first meeting with Helen Keller.--Helen Keller's
letter, which Mr. Clemens read at this meeting.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I will drop Orion for the present and return and pick him up
by and by. For the moment I am more interested in the matters of
to-day than I am in Orion's adventures and mine of forty-five
years ago.</p>

<p>Three days ago a neighbor brought the celebrated Russian
revolutionist, Tchaykoffsky, to call upon me. He is grizzled, and
shows age--as to exteriors--but he has a Vesuvius, inside, which
is a strong and active volcano yet. He is so full of belief in
the ultimate and almost immediate triumph of the revolution and
the destruction of the fiendish autocracy, that he almost made me
believe and hope with him. He has come over here expecting to
arouse a conflagration of noble sympathy in our vast nation of
eighty millions of happy and enthusiastic freemen. But honesty
obliged me to pour some cold water down his crater. I told him
what I believed to be true: that our Christianity which we have
always been so proud of--not to say so vain of--is now nothing
but a shell, a sham, a hypocrisy; that we have lost our ancient
sympathy with oppressed peoples struggling for life and liberty;
that when we are not coldly indifferent to such things we sneer
at them, and that the sneer is about the only expression the
newspapers and the nation deal in with regard to such things;
that his mass meetings would not be attended by people entitled
to call themselves representative Americans, even if they may
call themselves Americans at all; that his audiences will be
composed of foreigners who have suffered so recently that they
have not yet had time to become Americanized and their hearts
turned to stone in their breasts; that these audiences will be
drawn from the ranks of the poor, not those of the rich; that
they will give and give freely, but they will give from their
poverty and the money result will not be large. I said that when
our windy and flamboyant President conceived the idea, a year
ago, of advertising himself to the world as the new Angel of
Peace, and set himself the task of bringing about the peace
between Russia and Japan and had the misfortune to accomplish his
misbegotten purpose, no one in all this nation except Doctor
Seaman and myself uttered a public protest against this folly of
follies. That at that time I believed that that fatal peace had
postponed the Russian nation's imminent liberation from its
age-long chains indefinitely--probably for centuries; that I
believed at that time that Roosevelt had given the Russian
revolution its death-blow, and that I am of that opinion yet.</p>

<p>I will mention here, in parenthesis, that I came across Doctor
Seaman last night for the first time in my life, and found that
his opinion also remains to-day as he expressed it at the time
that that infamous peace was consummated.</p>

<p>Tchaykoffsky said that my talk depressed him profoundly, and
that he hoped I was wrong.</p>

<p>I said I hoped the same.</p>

<p>He said, "Why, from this very nation of yours came a mighty
contribution only two or three months ago, and it made us all
glad in Russia. You raised two millions of dollars in a
breath--in a moment, as it were--and sent that contribution, that
most noble and generous contribution, to suffering Russia. Does
not that modify your opinion?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "it doesn't. That money came not from Americans,
it came from Jews; much of it from rich Jews, but the most of it
from Russian and Polish Jews on the East Side--that is to say, it
came from the very poor. The Jew has always been benevolent.
Suffering can always move a Jew's heart and tax his pocket to the
limit. He will be at your mass meetings. But if you find any
Americans there put them in a glass case and exhibit them. It
will be worthy fifty cents a head to go and look at that show and
try to believe in it."</p>

<p>He asked me to come to last night's meeting and speak, but I
had another engagement and could not do it. Then he asked me to
write a line or two which could be read at the meeting, and I did
that cheerfully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Tovarishzy!"</p>

<p>When Nicholas Tchaykoffsky, hailed by his countrymen here as
the father of the revolutionary movement in Russia, spoke this
word last night in Grand Central Palace 3,000 men and women rose
to their feet, waved their hats, and cheered madly for three
minutes. The word means "Comrades!" It is the watchword of the
revolutionists. The spirit of revolution possessed the mass
meeting called to greet the Russian patriot now visiting New
York.</p>

<p>Fight is what he wants, and arms to fight with. He told the
audience so last night and, by their cheers, they promised to do
their part in supplying the sinews of war.</p>

<p>Mark Twain could not attend because he had already accepted an
invitation to another meeting, but he sent this letter:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MR. TCHAYKOFFSKY:</p>

<p>I thank you for the honor of the invitation, but I am not able
to accept it because Thursday evening I shall be presiding at a
meeting whose object is to find remunerative work for certain
classes of our blind who would gladly support themselves if they
had the opportunity.</p>

<p>My sympathies are with the Russian revolution, of course. It
goes without saying. I hope it will succeed, and now that I have
talked with you I take heart to believe it will. Government by
falsified promises, by lies, by treachery, and by the butcher
knife, for the aggrandizement of a single family of drones and
its idle and vicious kin has been borne quite long enough in
Russia, I should think. And it is to be hoped that the roused
nation, now rising in its strength, will presently put an end to
it and set up the republic in its place. Some of us, even the
white-headed, may live to see the blessed day when czars and
grand dukes will be as scarce there as I trust they are in
heaven.</p>

<p>Most sincerely yours,</p>

<p>MARK TWAIN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Mr. Tchaykoffsky made an impassioned appeal for help to
inaugurate a real revolution and overturn the Czar and all his
allies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The engagement which I spoke of to Tchaykoffsky was to act as
chairman at the first meeting of the association which was formed
five months ago in the interest of the adult blind. Joseph H.
Choate and I had a very good time there, and I came away with the
conviction that that excellent enterprise is going to flourish,
and will bear abundant fruit. The State of New York contains six
thousand listed blind persons and also a thousand or so who have
not been searched out and listed. There are between three and
four hundred blind children. The state confines its benevolence
to these. It confers upon them a book education. It teaches them
to read and write. It feeds them and shelters them. And of course
it pauperizes them, because it furnishes them no way of earning a
living for themselves. The state's conduct toward the adult
blind--and this conduct is imitated by the legislatures of most
of the other states--is purely infamous. Outside of the blind
asylums the adult blind person has a hard time. He lives merely
by the charity of the compassionate, when he has no relatives
able to support him--and now and then, as a benevolence, the
state stretches out its charitable hand and lifts him over to
Blackwell's Island and submerges him among that multitudinous
population of thieves and prostitutes.</p>

<p>But in Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania, and in two or three
other states, associations like this new one we have formed have
been at work for some years, supported entirely by private
subscriptions, and the benefits conferred and the work
accomplished are so fine and great that their official reports
read like a fairy-tale. It seems almost proven that there are not
so very many things accomplishable by persons gifted with sight
which a blind person cannot learn to do and do as well as that
other person.</p>

<p>Helen Keller was to have been present last night, but she is
ill in bed and has been ill in bed during several weeks, through
overwork in the interest of the blind, the deaf, and the dumb. I
need not go into any particulars about Helen Keller. She is
fellow to Caesar, Alexander, Napoleon, Homer, Shakespeare, and
the rest of the immortals. She will be as famous a thousand years
from now as she is to-day.</p>

<p>I remember the first time I ever had the privilege of seeing
her. She was fourteen years old then. She was to be at Laurence
Hutton's house on a Sunday afternoon, and twelve or fifteen men
and women had been invited to come and see her. Henry Rogers and
I went together. The company had all assembled and had been
waiting awhile. The wonderful child arrived now, with her about
equally wonderful teacher, Miss Sullivan. The girl began to
deliver happy ejaculations, in her broken speech. Without
touching anything, and without seeing anything, of course, and
without hearing anything, she seemed to quite well recognize the
character of her surroundings. She said, "Oh the books, the
books, so many, many books. How lovely!"</p>

<p>The guests were brought one after another and introduced to
her. As she shook hands with each she took her hand away and laid
her fingers lightly against Miss Sullivan's lips, who spoke
against them the person's name. When a name was difficult, Miss
Sullivan not only spoke it against Helen's fingers, but spelled
it upon Helen's hand with her own fingers--stenographically,
apparently, for the swiftness of the operation was suggestive of
that.</p>

<p>Mr. Howells seated himself by Helen on the sofa and she put
her fingers against his lips and he told her a story of
considerable length, and you could see each detail of it pass
into her mind and strike fire there and throw the flash of it
into her face. Then I told her a long story, which she
interrupted all along and in the right places, with cackles,
chuckles, and care-free bursts of laughter. Then Miss Sullivan
put one of Helen's hands against her lips and spoke against it
the question, "What is Mr. Clemens distinguished for?" Helen
answered, in her crippled speech, "For his humor." I spoke up
modestly and said, "And for his wisdom." Helen said the same
words instantly--"And for his wisdom." I suppose it was a case of
mental telegraphy, since there was no way for her to know what it
was I had said.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours spent very pleasantly, some one asked
if Helen would remember the feel of the hands of the company
after this considerable interval of time, and be able to
discriminate the hands and name the possessors of them. Miss
Sullivan said, "Oh, she will have no difficulty about that." So
the company filed past, shook hands in turn, and with each
handshake Helen greeted the owner of the hand pleasantly and
spoke the name that belonged to it without hesitation, until she
encountered Mr. Rogers, toward the end of the procession. She
shook hands with him, then paused, and a reflecting expression
came into her face. Then she said: "I am glad to meet you now. I
have not met you before." Miss Sullivan told her she was
mistaken; this gentleman was introduced to her when she first
arrived in the room. But Helen was not affected by that. She said
no, she never had met this gentleman before. Then Mr. Rogers said
that perhaps the confusion might be explained by the fact that he
had his glove on when he was introduced to Helen. Of course that
explained the matter.</p>

<p>This was not in the afternoon, as I have misstated. It was in
the forenoon, and by and by the assemblage proceeded to the
dining-room and sat down to luncheon. I had to go away before it
was over, and as I passed by Helen I patted her lightly on the
head and passed on. Miss Sullivan called to me and said: "Stop,
Mr. Clemens. Helen is distressed because she did not recognize
your hand. Won't you come back and do that again?" I went back
and patted her lightly on the head, and she said at once, "Oh,
it's Mr. Clemens."</p>

<p>Perhaps some one can explain this miracle, but I have never
been able to do it. Could she feel the wrinkles in my hand
through her hair? Some one else must answer this. I am not
competent.</p>

<p>As I have said, Helen was not able to leave her sick-bed, but
she wrote a letter, two or three days ago, to be read at the
meeting, and Miss Holt, the secretary, sent it to me by a
messenger at mid-afternoon yesterday. It was lucky for me that
she didn't reserve it and send it to me on the platform last
night, for in that case I could not have gotten through with it.
I read it to the house without a break in my voice, and also
without even a tremor in it that could be noticed, I think. But
it was because I had read it aloud to Miss Lyon at mid-afternoon,
and I knew the dangerous places and how to be prepared for them.
I told the house in the beginning that I had this letter and that
I would read it at the end of the evening's activities. By and by
when the end had arrived and Mr. Choate had spoken, I introduced
the letter with a few words. I said that if I knew anything about
literature, here was a fine and great and noble sample of it;
that this letter was simple, direct, unadorned, unaffected,
unpretentious, and was moving and beautiful and eloquent; that no
fellow to it had ever issued from any girl's lips since Joan of
Arc, that immortal child of seventeen, stood alone and friendless
in her chains, five centuries ago, and confronted her judges--the
concentrated learning and intellect of France--and fenced with
them week by week and day by day, answering them out of her great
heart and her untaught but marvelous mind, and always defeating
them, always camping on the field and master of it as each day's
sun went down. I said I believed that this letter, written by a
young woman who has been stone deaf, dumb, and blind ever since
she was eighteen months old, and who is one of the most widely
and thoroughly educated women in the world, would pass into our
literature as a classic and remain so. I will insert the letter
here.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WRENTHAM, MASS., <i>March 27, 1906.</i></p>

<p>MY DEAR MR. CLEMENS:</p>

<p>It is a great disappointment to me not to be with you and the
other friends who have joined their strength to uplift the blind.
The meeting in New York will be the greatest occasion in the
movement which has so long engaged my heart: and I regret keenly
not to be present and feel the inspiration of living contact with
such an assembly of wit, wisdom and philanthropy. I should be
happy if I could have spelled into my hand the words as they fall
from your lips, and receive, even as it is uttered, the eloquence
of our newest Ambassador to the blind. We have not had such
advocates before. My disappointment is softened by the thought
that never at any meeting was the right word so sure to be
spoken. But, superfluous as all other appeal must seem after you
and Mr. Choate have spoken, nevertheless, as I am a woman, I
cannot be silent, and I ask you to read this letter, knowing that
it will be lifted to eloquence by your kindly voice.</p>

<p>To know what the blind man needs, you who can see must imagine
what it would be not to see, and you can imagine it more vividly
if you remember that before your journey's end you may have to go
the dark way yourself. Try to realize what blindness means to
those whose joyous activity is stricken to inaction.</p>

<p>It is to live long, long days, and life is made up of days. It
is to live immured, baffled, impotent, all God's world shut out.
It is to sit helpless, defrauded, while your spirit strains and
tugs at its fetters, and your shoulders ache for the burden they
are denied, the rightful burden of labor.</p>

<p>The seeing man goes about his business confident and
self-dependent. He does his share of the work of the world in
mine, in quarry, in factory, in counting-room, asking of others
no boon, save the opportunity to do a man's part and to receive
the laborer's guerdon. In an instant accident blinds him. The day
is blotted out. Night envelops all the visible world. The feet
which once bore him to his task with firm and confident stride
stumble and halt and fear the forward step. He is forced to a new
habit of idleness, which like a canker consumes the mind and
destroys its beautiful faculties. Memory confronts him with his
lighted past. Amid the tangible ruins of his life as it promised
to be he gropes his pitiful way. You have met him on your busy
thoroughfares with faltering feet and outstretched hands,
patiently "dredging" the universal dark, holding out for sale his
petty wares, or his cap for your pennies; and this was a Man with
ambitions and capabilities.</p>

<p>It is because we know that these ambitions and capabilities
can be fulfilled, that we are working to improve the condition of
the adult blind. You cannot bring back the light to the vacant
eyes; but you can give a helping hand to the sightless along
their dark pilgrimage. You can teach them new skill. For work
they once did with the aid of their eyes you can substitute work
that they can do with their hands. They ask only opportunity, and
opportunity is a torch in darkness. They crave no charity, no
pension, but the satisfaction that comes from lucrative toil, and
this satisfaction is the right of every human being.</p>

<p>At your meeting New York will speak its word for the blind,
and when New York speaks, the world listens. The true message of
New York is not the commercial ticking of busy telegraphs, but
the mightier utterances of such gatherings as yours. Of late our
periodicals have been filled with depressing revelations of great
social evils. Querulous critics have pointed to every flaw in our
civic structure. We have listened long enough to the pessimists.
You once told me you were a pessimist, Mr. Clemens, but great men
are usually mistaken about themselves. You are an optimist. If
you were not, you would not preside at the meeting. For it is an
answer to pessimism. It proclaims that the heart and the wisdom
of a great city are devoted to the good of mankind, that in this
busiest city in the world no cry of distress goes up but receives
a compassionate and generous answer. Rejoice that the cause of
the blind has been heard in New York; for the day after, it shall
be heard round the world.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>HELEN KELLER.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, March 31.--President Roosevelt surprised the
capital this afternoon by announcing that he would appoint
Benjamin F. Barnes as Postmaster of Washington, to succeed John
A. Merritt of New York. Mr. Merritt, who for several years has
been Postmaster here, has been chosen for Collector of the Port
of Niagara, succeeding the late Major James Low.</p>

<p>Mr. Barnes is at present assistant secretary to the President.
Only a short time ago he figured extensively in the newspapers
for having ordered the forcible ejection from the White House of
Mrs. Minor Morris, a Washington woman who had called to see the
President. What attracted attention to the case was not the
ejection itself, but the violence with which it was
performed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris, who had been talking to Barnes in an ordinary
conversational tone, and with no indications of excitement, so
far as the spectators observed, was seized by two policemen and
dragged by the arms out of the building and across the asphalt
walk in front of the White House, a distance corresponding to
that of two ordinary city blocks. During a part of the journey a
negro carried her by the feet. Her dress was torn and
trampled.</p>

<p>She was locked up on a charge of disorderly conduct, and when
it was learned that she would be released on that charge a
policeman, a relative of Barnes's, was sent to the House of
Detention to prefer a charge of insanity against her so that she
would have to be held. She was held accordingly until two
physicians had examined her and pronounced her sane. He was
denounced by Mrs. Morris, by various newspapers, and by Mr.
Tillman in the Senate.</p>

<p>The appointment of Barnes to be Postmaster so soon after this
incident has created endless talk here. It is taken to be the
President's way of expressing confidence in Barnes and repaying
him for the pain he suffered as a result of the newspaper
criticisms of his course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Orion Clemens again. To continue.</p>

<p>The government of the new Territory of Nevada was an
interesting menagerie. Governor Nye was an old and seasoned
politician from New York--politician, not statesman. He had white
hair. He was in fine physical condition. He had a winningly
friendly face and deep lustrous brown eyes that could talk as a
native language the tongue of every feeling, every passion, every
emotion. His eyes could outtalk his tongue, and this is saying a
good deal, for he was a very remarkable talker, both in private
and on the stump. He was a shrewd man. He generally saw through
surfaces and perceived what might be going on inside without
being suspected of having an eye on the matter.</p>

<p>When grown-up persons indulge in practical jokes, the fact
gauges them. They have lived narrow, obscure, and ignorant lives,
and at full manhood they still retain and cherish a job lot of
leftover standards and ideals that would have been discarded with
their boyhood if they had then moved out into the world and a
broader life. There were many practical jokers in the new
Territory. I do not take pleasure in exposing this fact, for I
liked those people; but what I am saying is true. I wish I could
say a kindlier thing about them instead. If I could say they were
burglars, or hatrack thieves, or something like that, that
wouldn't be utterly uncomplimentary. I would prefer it, but I
can't say those things. They would not be true. These people were
practical jokers, and I will not try to disguise it. In other
respects they were plenty good enough people; honest people;
reputable and likable. They played practical jokes upon each
other with success, and got the admiration and applause and also
the envy of the rest of the community. Naturally they were eager
to try their arts on big game, and that was what the Governor
was. But they were not able to score. They made several efforts,
but the Governor defeated these efforts without any trouble and
went on smiling his pleasant smile as if nothing had happened.
Finally the joker chiefs of Carson City and Virginia City
conspired together to see if their combined talent couldn't win a
victory, for the jokers were getting into a very uncomfortable
place. The people were laughing at them, instead of at their
proposed victim. They banded themselves together to the number of
ten and invited the Governor to what was a most extraordinary
attention in those days--pickled-oyster stew and
champagne--luxuries very seldom seen in that region, and existing
rather as fabrics of the imagination than as facts.</p>

<p>The Governor took me with him. He said, disparagingly: "It's a
poor invention. It doesn't deceive. Their idea is to get me drunk
and leave me under the table, and from their standpoint this will
be very funny. But they don't know me. I am familiar with
champagne and have no prejudices against it."</p>

<p>The fate of the joke was not decided until two o'clock in the
morning. At that hour the Governor was serene, genial,
comfortable, contented, happy, and sober, although he was so full
that he couldn't laugh without shedding champagne tears. Also, at
that hour the last joker joined his comrades under the table,
drunk to the last perfection. The Governor remarked: "This is a
dry place, Sam. Let's go and get something to drink and go to
bed."</p>

<p>The Governor's official menagerie had been drawn from the
humblest ranks of his constituents at home--harmless good fellows
who had helped in his campaigns, and now they had their reward in
petty salaries payable in greenbacks that were worth next to
nothing. Those boys had a hard time to make both ends meet.
Orion's salary was eighteen hundred dollars a year, and he
couldn't even support his dictionary on it. But the Irishwoman
who had come out on the Governor's staff charged the menagerie
only ten dollars a week apiece for board and lodging. Orion and I
were of her boarders and lodgers; and so, on these cheap terms
the silver I had brought from home held out very well.</p>

<p>At first I roamed about the country seeking silver, but at the
end of '62 or the beginning of '63 when I came up from Aurora to
begin a journalistic life on the Virginia City <i>Enterprise,</i>
I was presently sent down to Carson City to report the
legislative session. Orion was soon very popular with the members
of the legislature, because they found that whereas they couldn't
usually trust each other, nor anybody else, they could trust him.
He easily held the belt for honesty in that country, but it
didn't do him any good in a pecuniary way, because he had no
talent for either persuading or scaring legislators. But I was
differently situated. I was there every day in the legislature to
distribute compliment and censure with evenly balanced justice
and spread the same over half a page of the <i>Enterprise</i>
every morning; consequently I was an influence. I got the
legislature to pass a law requiring every corporation doing
business in the territory to record its charter in full, without
skipping a word, in a record to be kept by the Secretary of the
Territory--my brother. All the charters were framed in exactly
the same words. For this record service he was authorized to
charge forty cents a folio of one hundred words for making the
record; five dollars for furnishing a certificate of each record,
and so on. Everybody had a toll-road franchise, but no toll road.
But the franchise had to be recorded and paid for. Everybody was
a mining corporation, and had to have himself recorded and pay
for it. Very well, we prospered. The record service paid an
average of one thousand dollars a month, in gold.</p>

<p>Governor Nye was often absent from the Territory. He liked to
run down to San Francisco every little while and enjoy a rest
from Territorial civilization. Nobody complained, for he was
prodigiously popular. He had been a stage-driver in his early
days in New York or New England, and had acquired the habit of
remembering names and faces, and of making himself agreeable to
his passengers. As a politician this had been valuable to him,
and he kept his arts in good condition by practice. By the time
he had been Governor a year he had shaken hands with every human
being in the Territory of Nevada, and after that he always knew
these people instantly at sight and could call them by name. The
whole population, of 20,000 persons, were his personal friends,
and he could do anything he chose to do and count upon their
being contented with it. Whenever he was absent from the
Territory--which was generally--Orion served his office in his
place, as Acting Governor, a title which was soon and easily
shortened to "Governor." Mrs. Governor Clemens enjoyed being a
Governor's wife. No one on this planet ever enjoyed a distinction
more than she enjoyed that one. Her delight in being the head of
society was so frank that it disarmed criticism, and even envy.
Being the Governor's wife and head of society, she looked for a
proper kind of house to live in--a house commensurate with these
dignities--and she easily persuaded Orion to build that house.
Orion could be persuaded to do anything. He built and furnished
the house at a cost of twelve thousand dollars, and there was no
other house in that capital that could approach this property for
style and cost.</p>

<p>When Governor Nye's four-year term was drawing to a close, the
mystery of why he had ever consented to leave the great State of
New York and help inhabit that sage-brush desert was solved. He
had gone out there in order to become a United States Senator.
All that was now necessary was to turn the Territory into a
State. He did it without any difficulty. That patch of sand and
that sparse population were not well fitted for the heavy burden
of a State government, but no matter, the people were willing to
have the change, and so the Governor's game was made.</p>

<p>Orion's game was made, too, apparently, for he was as popular
because of his honesty as the Governor was for more substantial
reasons. But at the critical moment the inborn capriciousness of
his character rose up without warning, and disaster followed.</p>

<center>
<h5>NOMINATION OF BARNES OPENS WAY FOR AN INQUIRY.</h5>
</center>

<p> </p>

<center>
<p><i>(Special to The New York Times.)</i></p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, April 3.--Criticism of the appointment of Mr.
Roosevelt's Assistant Secretary, B. F. Barnes, to be Postmaster
of Washington continues. It now seems likely that the appointment
may have a hard time in passing the Senate. Barnes's action in
having Mrs. Minor Morris put out of the White House is the chief
ground of opposition. The Senate Committee on Post Offices and
Post Roads has determined to investigate Barnes's action in the
Morris case, and eye witnesses of the affair have been summoned
to appear before the committee to-morrow and tell what they saw.
This is the same investigation which Mr. Tillman requested and
which the Senate refused to grant. It now comes as the result of
the President's action in appointing Barnes Postmaster. The
witnesses who are to appear before the committee were not asked
to testify in the investigation which the President made when he
decided that Barnes's course was justified.</p>

<p>There was much speculation to-day as to who Mr. Barnes's
successor as Assistant Secretary would be. The <i>Evening
Star</i> to-night devotes a column and a half to suggestions on
the subject, saying that the leading candidates are John L.
McGrew, a clerk in the White House offices; Warren Young, Chief
Executive Clerk; M. C. Latta, the President's personal
stenographer; James J. Corbett of New York, Robert Fitzsimmons,
Augustus Ruhlin, and James J. Jeffries.</p>

<p>The article is illustrated with two pictures of Corbett and
Fitzsimmons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That is neat, and causes me much gentle delight. The point of
that whole matter lies in the last four names that are mentioned
in it. These four men are prize-fighters--the most celebrated
ones now living.</p>

<p>Is the incident now closed? Again we cannot tell. The smell of
it may linger in American history a thousand years yet.</p>

<p>This autobiography of mine differs from other
autobiographies--differs from <i>all</i> other autobiographies,
except Benvenuto's, perhaps. The conventional biography of all
the ages is an open window. The autobiographer sits there and
examines and discusses the people that go by--not all of them,
but the notorious ones, the famous ones; those that wear fine
uniforms, and crowns when it is not raining; and very great poets
and great statesmen--illustrious people with whom he has had the
high privilege of coming in contact. He likes to toss a wave of
recognition to these with his hand as they go by, and he likes to
notice that the others are seeing him do this, and admiring. He
likes to let on that in discussing these occasional people that
wear the good clothes he is only interested in interesting his
reader and is in a measure unconscious of himself.</p>

<p>But this autobiography of mine is not that kind of an
autobiography. This autobiography of mine is a mirror, and I am
looking at myself in it all the time. Incidentally I notice the
people that pass along at my back--I get glimpses of them in the
mirror--and whenever they say or do anything that can help
advertise me and flatter me and raise me in my own estimation, I
set these things down in my autobiography. I rejoice when a king
or a duke comes my way and makes himself useful to this
autobiography, but they are rare customers, with wide intervals
between. I can use them with good effect as lighthouses and
monuments along my way, but for real business I depend upon the
common herd.</p>

<h4>OTHER LITERARY CURIOSITIES FROM THE NAST COLLECTION AT
AUCTION.</h4>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p>The sale of autograph letters, wash drawings, pencil and pen
and ink sketches, the property of the late Thomas Nast, the
cartoonist, was continued yesterday by the Merwin-Clayton
Company.</p>

<p>Five letters from Theodore Roosevelt as Police Commissioner,
colonel of the Rough Riders, Governor, and President, to Mr.
Nast, thanking him for sketches and expressing warm friendship
for the cartoonist, brought prices ranging from $1.50 to
$2.25.</p>

<p>Richard A. McCurdy's autograph letter and original autograph
poem addressed to Nast, with a typewritten copy of the poem,
brought 30 cents the lot.</p>

<p>The following letter written by Gen. Philip H. Sheridan to
Nast was bid in at $12.25 by J. H. Manning, a son of the late
Daniel Manning:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>May 12, 1875.</p>

<p>"DEAR NAST:</p>

<p>"It is true. I will be married on the 30th of June coming
unless there is a slip between the cup and the lip, which is
scarcely possible. I will not have any wedding for many reasons,
among them the recent death of my father.</p>

<p>"I am very happy, but wish the d--d thing was over.</p>

<p>"Yours truly,</p>

<p>"SHERIDAN.</p>

<p>"P. S. and M. I.--I send the inclosed for your oldest. Please
send me yours to be kept for mine.</p>

<p>"P. H. S."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A letter written by Lincoln, and which was laid over a piece
of white silk bearing a faded red stain, sold for $38. The
attached certificate stated that the silk was from the dress of
Laura Keene, worn on the night of Lincoln's assassination, and
that the stain was made by his blood.</p>

<p>Gen. W. T. Sherman's letter to Nast, dated March 9, 1879,
indorsing a testimonial of the cartoonist's services to the army
and navy, sold for $6.</p>

<p>A scrapbook containing sketches of Lincoln, Sumner, Greeley,
Walt Whitman, and many water-color sketches, brought $75.</p>

<p>A sketch of William M. Tweed and his companion, Hunt, under
arrest, brought $21. Two companion Christmas sketches by Nast,
representing a child telephoning to Santa Claus, brought $43
each. A sketch of Gen. Grant was bid in for $36. A sketch of the
"G. O. P." elephant brought $28. A sketch representing the
Saviour, full face, with nimbus, brought $65.</p>

<p>An autograph photograph of Theodore Roosevelt, dated 1884, was
bid in at $5.</p>

<p>It is a great satisfaction to me to notice that I am still
ahead--ahead of Roosevelt, ahead of Sherman, ahead of Sheridan,
even ahead of Lincoln. These are fine laurels, but they will not
last. A time is coming when some of them will wither. A day will
come when a mere scratch of Mr. Lincoln's pen will outsell a
whole basketful of my letters. A time will come when a scratch of
the pens of those immortal soldiers, Sherman and Sheridan, will
outsell a thousand scratches of mine, and so I shall enjoy my
supremacy now, while I may. I shall read that clipping over forty
or fifty times, now, while it is new and true, and let the
desolating future take care of itself.</p>

<p>Day before yesterday all Vassar, ancient and modern, packed
itself into the Hudson Theater, and I was there. The occasion was
a benefit arranged by Vassar and its friends to raise money to
aid poor students of that college in getting through the college
course. I was not aware that I was to be a feature of the show,
and was distressed and most uncomfortably inflamed with blushes
when I found it out. Really the distress and the blushes were
manufactured, for at bottom I was glad. I held a reception on
that stage for an hour or two, and all Vassar, ancient and
modern, shook hands with me. Some of the moderns were too
beautiful for words, and I was very friendly with those. I was so
hoping somebody would want to kiss me for my mother, but I didn't
dare to suggest it myself. Presently, however, when it happened,
I did what I could to make it contagious, and succeeded. This
required art, but I had it in stock. I <i>seemed</i> to take the
old and the new as they came, without discrimination, but I
averaged the percentage to my advantage, and without anybody's
suspecting, I think.</p>

<p>Among that host I met again as many as half a dozen pretty old
girls whom I had met in their bloom at Vassar that time that Susy
and I visited the college so long ago. Yesterday at the
University Club, almost all the five hundred were of the young
and lovely, untouched by care, unfaded by age. There were girls
there from Smith, Wellesley, Radcliffe, Vassar, and Barnard,
together with a sprinkling of college girls from the South, from
the Middle West and the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>I delivered a moral sermon to the Barnard girls at Columbia
University a few weeks ago, and now it was like being among old
friends. There were dozens of Barnard girls there, scores of
them, and I had already shaken hands with them at Barnard. As I
have said, the reporter heard many things there yesterday, but
there were several which he didn't hear. One sweet creature
wanted to whisper in my ear, and I was nothing loath. She raised
her dainty form on tiptoe, lifting herself with a grip of her
velvet hands on my shoulders, and put her lips to my ear and
said, "How do you like being the belle of New York?" It was so
true, and so gratifying, that it crimsoned me with blushes, and I
could make no reply. The reporter lost that.</p>

<p>Two girls, one from Maine, the other from Ohio, were
grandchildren of fellow-passengers who sailed with me in the
<i>Quaker City</i> in the <i>Innocents Abroad</i> excursion
thirty-nine years ago.</p>

will be the fiftieth anniversary. She will retire in due form at
a great banquet in London, and cablegrams meet for the occasion
will flow in upon the banqueters from old friends of hers in
America and other formerly distant regions of the earth--there
are no distant regions now. The American cablegrams are being
collected by a committee in New York, and by request I have
furnished mine. To do these things by cable, at twenty-five cents
a word, is the modern way and the only way. They could go by post
at no expense, but it wouldn't be good form. [Privately I will
remark that they <i>do</i> go by mail--dated to suit the

<h3>ORION CLEMENS RESUMED</h3>
</center>

<p>There were several candidates for all the offices in the gift
of the new State of Nevada save two--United States Senator
(Governor Nye) and Secretary of State (Orion Clemens). Nye was
certain to get a Senatorship, and Orion was so sure to get the
Secretaryship that no one but him was named for that office. But
he was hit with one of his spasms of virtue on the very day that
the Republican party was to make its nominations in the
convention. Orion refused to go near the convention. He was
urged, but all persuasions failed. He said his presence there
would be an unfair and improper influence, and that if he was to
be nominated the compliment must come to him as a free and
unspotted gift. This attitude would have settled his case for him
without further effort, but he had another spasm of virtue on the
same day, and that made it absolutely sure. It had been his habit
for a great many years to change his religion with his shirt, and
his ideas about temperance at the same time. He would be a
teetotaler for a while and the champion of the cause; then he
would change to the other side for a time. On nomination day he
suddenly changed from a friendly attitude toward whisky--which
was the popular attitude--to uncompromising teetotalism, and went
absolutely dry. His friends besought and implored, but all in
vain. He could not be persuaded to cross the threshold of a
saloon. The paper next morning contained the list of chosen
nominees. His name was not in it. He had not received a vote.</p>

<p>His rich income ceased when the State government came into
power. He was without an occupation. Something had to be done. He
put up his sign as attorney at law, but he got no clients. It was
strange. It was difficult to account for. I cannot account for
it--but if I were going to guess at a solution I should guess
that by the make of him he would examine both sides of a case so
diligently and so conscientiously that when he got through with
his argument neither he nor a jury would know which side he was
on. I think that his client would find out his make in laying his
case before him, and would take warning and withdraw it in time
to save himself from probable disaster.</p>

<p>I had taken up my residence in San Francisco about a year
before the time I have just been speaking of. One day I got a tip
from Mr. Camp, a bold man who was always making big fortunes in
ingenious speculations and losing them again in the course of six
months by other speculative ingenuities. Camp told me to buy some
shares in the Hale and Norcross. I bought fifty shares at three
hundred dollars a share. I bought on a margin, and put up 20 per
cent. It exhausted my funds. I wrote Orion and offered him half,
and asked him to send his share of the money. I waited and
waited. He wrote and said he was going to attend to it. The stock
went along up pretty briskly. It went higher and higher. It
reached a thousand dollars a share. It climbed to two thousand,
then to three thousand; then to twice that figure. The money did
not come, but I was not disturbed. By and by that stock took a
turn and began to gallop down. Then I wrote urgently. Orion
answered that he had sent the money long ago--said he had sent it
to the Occidental Hotel. I inquired for it. They said it was not
there. To cut a long story short, that stock went on down until
it fell below the price I had paid for it. Then it began to eat
up the margin, and when at last I got out I was very badly
crippled.</p>

<p>When it was too late, I found out what had become of Orion's
money. Any other human being would have sent a check, but he sent
gold. The hotel clerk put it in the safe and never thought of it
again, and there it reposed all this time, enjoying its fatal
work, no doubt. Another man might have thought to tell me that
the money was not in a letter, but was in an express package, but
it never occurred to Orion to do that.</p>

<p>Later, Mr. Camp gave me another chance. He agreed to buy our
Tennessee land for two hundred thousand dollars, pay a part of
the amount in cash and give long notes for the rest. His scheme
was to import foreigners from grape-growing and wine-making
districts in Europe, settle them on the land, and turn it into a
wine-growing country. He knew what Mr. Longworth thought of those
Tennessee grapes, and was satisfied. I sent the contracts and
things to Orion for his signature, he being one of the three
heirs. But they arrived at a bad time--in a doubly bad time, in
fact. The temperance virtue was temporarily upon him in strong
force, and he wrote and said that he would not be a party to
debauching the country with wine. Also he said how could he know
whether Mr. Camp was going to deal fairly and honestly with those
poor people from Europe or not?--and so, without waiting to find
out, he quashed the whole trade, and there it fell, never to be
brought to life again. The land, from being suddenly worth two
hundred thousand dollars, became as suddenly worth what it was
before--nothing, and taxes to pay. I had paid the taxes and the
other expenses for some years, but I dropped the Tennessee land
there, and have never taken any interest in it since, pecuniarily
or otherwise, until yesterday.</p>

<p>I had supposed, until yesterday, that Orion had frittered away
the last acre, and indeed that was his impression. But a
gentleman arrived yesterday from Tennessee and brought a map
showing that by a correction of the ancient surveys we still own
a thousand acres, in a coal district, out of the hundred thousand
acres which my father left us when he died in 1847. The gentleman
brought a proposition; also he brought a reputable and well-to-do
citizen of New York. The proposition was that the Tennesseean
gentleman should sell that land; that the New York gentleman
should pay all the expenses and fight all the lawsuits, in case
any should turn up, and that of such profit as might eventuate
the Tennesseean gentleman should take a third, the New Yorker a
third, and Sam Moffett and his sister (Mrs. Charles L. Webster),
and I--who are the surviving heirs--the remaining third.</p>

<p>This time I hope we shall get rid of the Tennessee land for
good and all and never hear of it again. It was created under a
misapprehension; my father loaded himself up with it under a
misapprehension; he unloaded it on to us under a misapprehension,
and I should like to get rid of the accumulated misapprehensions
and what is left of the land as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I came East in January, 1867. Orion remained in Carson City
perhaps a year longer. Then he sold his twelve-thousand-dollar
house and its furniture for thirty-five hundred in greenbacks at
about 30 per cent discount. He and his wife took first-class
passage in the steamer for New York. In New York they stopped at
an expensive hotel; explored the city in an expensive way; then
fled to Keokuk, and arrived there about as nearly penniless as
they were when they had migrated thence in July, '61. About 1871
or '72 they came to New York. They were obliged to go somewhere.
Orion had been trying to make a living in the law ever since he
had arrived from the Pacific coast, but he had secured only two
cases. Those he was to try free of charge--but the possible
result will never be known, because the parties settled the case
out of court without his help.</p>

<p>I had bought my mother a house in Keokuk. I was giving her a
stated sum monthly, and Orion another stated sum. They all lived
together in the house.</p>

<p>But, as I say, they came East and Orion got a job as
proofreader on the New York <i>Evening Post</i> at ten dollars a
week. They took a single small room, and in it they cooked, and
lived on that money. By and by Orion came to Hartford and wanted
me to get him a place as reporter on a Hartford paper. Here was a
chance to try my scheme again, and I did it. I made him go to the
Hartford <i>Evening Post,</i> without any letter of introduction,
and propose to scrub and sweep and do all sorts of things for
nothing, on the plea that he didn't need money, but only needed
work, and that was what he was pining for. Within six weeks he
was on the editorial staff of that paper at twenty dollars a
week, and he was worth the money. He was presently called for by
some other paper at better wages, but I made him go to the
<i>Post</i> people and tell them about it. They stood the raise
and kept him. It was the pleasantest berth he had ever had in his
life. It was an easy berth. He was in every way comfortable. But
ill luck came. It was bound to come.</p>

<p>A new Republican daily was to be started in Rutland, Vermont,
by a stock company of well-to-do politicians, and they offered
Orion the chief editorship at three thousand a year. He was eager
to accept. His wife was equally eager--no, twice as eager, three
times as eager. My beseechings and reasonings went for nothing. I
said:</p>

<p>"You are as weak as water. Those people will find it out right
away. They will easily see that you have no backbone; that they
can deal with you as they would deal with a slave. You may last
six months, but not longer. Then they will not dismiss you as
they would dismiss a gentleman: they will fling you out as they
would fling out an intruding tramp."</p>

<p>It happened just so. Then Orion and his wife migrated to that
persecuted and unoffending Keokuk once more. Orion wrote from
there that he was not resuming the law; that he thought that what
his health needed was the open air, in some sort of outdoor
occupation; that his old father-in-law had a strip of ground on
the river border a mile above Keokuk with some sort of a house on
it, and his idea was to buy that place and start a chicken farm
and provide Keokuk with chickens and eggs, and perhaps
butter--but I don't know whether you can raise butter on a
chicken farm or not. He said the place could be had for three
thousand dollars cash, and I sent the money. Orion began to raise
chickens, and he made a detailed monthly report to me, whereby it
appeared that he was able to work off his chickens on the Keokuk
people at a dollar and a quarter a pair. But it also appeared
that it cost a dollar and sixty cents to raise the pair. This did
not seem to discourage Orion, and so I let it go. Meantime he was
borrowing a hundred dollars per month of me regularly, month by
month. Now to show Orion's stern and rigid business ways--and he
really prided himself on his large business capacities--the
moment he received the advance of a hundred dollars at the
beginning of each month, he sent me his note for the amount, and
with it he sent, out of that money, <i>three months' interest</i>
on the hundred dollars at 6 per cent per annum, these notes being
always for three months. I did not keep them, of course. They
were of no value to anybody.</p>

<p>As I say, he always sent a detailed statement of the month's
profit and loss on the chickens--at least the month's loss on the
chickens--and this detailed statement included the various items
of expense--corn for the chickens, a bonnet for the wife, boots
for himself, and so on; even car fares, and the weekly
contribution of ten cents to help out the missionaries who were
trying to damn the Chinese after a plan not satisfactory to those
people. But at last when among those details I found twenty-five
dollars for pew rent I struck. I told him to change his religion
and sell the pew.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Clemens's present house unsatisfactory because of no
sunshine.---Mr. Clemens meets Etta in Washington Square. Recalls
ballroom in Virginia City forty-four years ago.--Orion resumed;
he invents wood-sawing machine; invents steam canal
boat.--Orion's autobiography.--His death.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>This house is No. 21 Fifth Avenue, and stands on the corner of
Ninth Street within a couple of hundred yards of Washington
Square. It was built fifty or sixty years ago by Renwick, the
architect of the Roman Catholic Cathedral. It is large, and every
story has good and spacious rooms, but not enough sunshine.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went down to Washington Square, turned out to the
left to look at a house that stands on the corner of the Square
and University Place. Presently I stepped over to the corner of
the Square to take a general look at the frontage of the house.
While crossing the street I met a woman, and was conscious that
she recognized me, and it seemed to me that there was something
in her face that was familiar to me. I had the instinct that she
would turn and follow me and speak to me, and the instinct was
right. She was a fat little woman, with a gentle and kindly but
aged and homely face, and she had white hair, and was neatly but
poorly dressed. She said:</p>

<p>"Aren't you Mr. Clemens?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I am."</p>

<p>She said, "Where is your brother Orion?"</p>

<p>"Dead," I said.</p>

<p>"Where is his wife?"</p>

<p>"Dead," I said; and added, "I seem to know you, but I cannot
place you."</p>

<p>She said, "Do you remember Etta Booth?"</p>

<p>I had known only one Etta Booth in my lifetime, and that Etta
rose before me in an instant, and vividly. It was almost as if
she stood alongside of this fat little antiquated dame in the
bloom and diffidence and sweetness of her thirteen years, her
hair in plaited tails down her back and her fiery-red frock
stopping short at her knees. Indeed I remembered Etta very well.
And immediately another vision rose before me, with that child in
the center of it and accenting its sober tint like a torch with
her red frock. But it was not a quiet vision; not a reposeful
one. The scene was a great ballroom in some ramshackle building
in Gold Hill or Virginia City, Nevada. There were two or three
hundred stalwart men present and dancing with cordial energy. And
in the midst of the turmoil Etta's crimson frock was swirling and
flashing; and she was the only dancer of her sex on the floor.
Her mother, large, fleshy, pleasant, and smiling, sat on a bench
against the wall in lonely and honored state and watched the
festivities in placid contentment. She and Etta were the only
persons of their sex in the ballroom. Half of the men represented
ladies, and they had a handkerchief tied around the left arm so
that they could be told from the men. I did not dance with Etta,
for I was a lady myself. I wore a revolver in my belt, and so did
all the other ladies--likewise the gentlemen. It was a dismal old
barn of a place, and was lighted from end to end by tallow-candle
chandeliers made of barrel hoops suspended from the ceiling, and
the grease dripped all over us. That was in the beginning of the
winter of 1862. It has taken forty-four years for Etta to cross
my orbit again.</p>

<p>I asked after her father.</p>

<p>"Dead," she said.</p>

<p>I asked after her mother.</p>

<p>"Dead," she said.</p>

<p>Another question brought out the fact that she had long been
married, but had no children. We shook hands and parted. She
walked three or four steps, then turned and came back, and her
eyes filled, and she said:</p>

<p>"I am a stranger here, and far from my friends--in fact I have
hardly any friends left. Nearly all of them are dead. I must tell
my news to you. I <i>must</i> tell it to somebody. I can't bear
it by myself, while it is so new. The doctor has just told me
that my husband can live only a very little while, and I was not
dreaming it was so bad as this."</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>ORION RESUMED</h3>
</center>

<p>I think the poultry experiment lasted only a year, possibly
two years. It had then cost me six thousand dollars. It is my
impression that Orion was not able to give the farm away, and
that his father-in-law took it back as a kindly act of
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Orion returned to the law business, and I suppose he remained
in that harness off and on for the succeeding quarter of a
century, but so far as my knowledge goes he was only a lawyer in
name, and had no clients.</p>

<p>My mother died in her eighty-eighth year, in the summer of
1890. She had saved some money, and she left it to me, because it
had come from me. I gave it to Orion and he said, with thanks,
that I had supported him long enough and now he was going to
relieve me of that burden and would also hope to pay back some of
that expense, and maybe the whole of it. Accordingly, he
proceeded to use up that money in building a considerable
addition to the house, with the idea of taking boarders and
getting rich. We need not dwell upon this venture. It was another
of his failures. His wife tried hard to make the scheme succeed,
and if anybody could have made it succeed she would have done it.
She was a good woman and was greatly liked. Her vanity was pretty
large and inconvenient, but she had a practical side, too, and
she would have made that boarding-house lucrative if
circumstances had not been against her.</p>

<p>Orion had other projects for recouping me, but as they always
required capital I stayed out of them, but they did not
materialize. Once he wanted to start a newspaper. It was a
ghastly idea, and I squelched it with a promptness that was
almost rude. Then he invented a wood-sawing machine and patched
it together himself, and he really sawed wood with it. It was
ingenious; it was capable; and it would have made a comfortable
little fortune for him; but just at the wrong time Providence
interfered again. Orion applied for a patent and found that the
same machine had already been patented and had gone into business
and was thriving.</p>

<p>Presently the State of New York offered a
fifty-thousand-dollar prize for a practical method of navigating
the Erie Canal with steam canal boats. Orion worked at that thing
two or three years, invented and completed a method, and was once
more ready to reach out and seize upon imminent wealth, when
somebody pointed out a defect. His steam canal boat could not be
used in the wintertime; and in the summertime the commotion its
wheels would make in the water would wash away the State of New
York on both sides.</p>

<p>Innumerable were Orion's projects for acquiring the means to
pay off his debt to me. These projects extended straight through
the succeeding thirty years, but in every case they failed.
During all those thirty years Orion's well-established honesty
kept him in offices of trust where other people's money had to be
taken care of, but where no salary was paid. He was treasurer of
all the benevolent institutions; he took care of the money and
other property of widows and orphans; he never lost a cent for
anybody, and never made one for himself. Every time he changed
his religion the church of his new faith was glad to get him;
made him treasurer at once, and at once he stopped the graft and
the leaks in that church. He exhibited a facility in changing his
political complexion that was a marvel to the whole community.
Once this curious thing happened, and he wrote me all about it
himself.</p>

<p>One morning he was a Republican, and upon invitation he agreed
to make a campaign speech at the Republican mass meeting that
night. He prepared the speech. After luncheon he became a
Democrat and agreed to write a score of exciting mottoes to be
painted upon the transparencies which the Democrats would carry
in their torchlight procession that night. He wrote these
shouting Democratic mottoes during the afternoon, and they
occupied so much of his time that it was night before he had a
chance to change his politics again; so he actually made a
rousing Republican campaign speech in the open air while his
Democratic transparencies passed by in front of him, to the joy
of every witness present.</p>

<p>He was a most strange creature--but in spite of his
eccentricities he was beloved, all his life, in whatsoever
community he lived. And he was also held in high esteem, for at
bottom he was a sterling man.</p>

<p>About twenty-five years ago--along there somewhere--I wrote
and suggested to Orion that he write an autobiography. I asked
him to try to tell the straight truth in it; to refrain from
exhibiting himself in creditable attitudes exclusively, and to
honorably set down all the incidents of his life which he had
found interesting to him, including those which were burned into
his memory because he was ashamed of them. I said that this had
never been done, and that if he could do it his autobiography
would be a most valuable piece of literature. I said I was
offering him a job which I could not duplicate in my own case,
but I would cherish the hope that he might succeed with it. I
recognize now that I was trying to saddle upon him an
impossibility. I have been dictating this autobiography of mine
daily for three months; I have thought of fifteen hundred or two
thousand incidents in my life which I am ashamed of, but I have
not gotten one of them to consent to go on paper yet. I think
that that stock will still be complete and unimpaired when I
finish this autobiography, if I ever finish it. I believe that if
I should put in all those incidents I would be sure to strike
them out when I came to revise this book.</p>

<p>While we were living in Vienna in 1898 a cablegram came from
Keokuk announcing Orion's death. He was seventy-two years old. He
had gone down to the kitchen in the early hours of a bitter
December morning; he had built the fire, and then sat down at a
table to write something, and there he died, with the pencil in
his hand and resting against the paper in the middle of an
unfinished word--an indication that his release from the
captivity of a long and troubled and pathetic and unprofitable
life was swift and painless.</p>

French friend of mine, inclosing this New York cablegram:</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>MARK TWAIN INTERDIT</h3>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p>NEW YORK, 27 mars. <i>(Par d&eacute;p&ecirc;che de notre
correspondant particulier.)</i>--Les directeurs de la
biblioth&egrave;que de Brooklyn ont mis les deux derniers livres
de Mark Twain &agrave; l'index pour les enfants au-dessous de
quinze ans, les consid&eacute;rant comme malsains.</p>

<p>Le c&eacute;l&egrave;bre humoriste a &eacute;crit a des
fonctionnaires une lettre pleine d'esprit et de sarcasme. Ces
messieurs se refusent &agrave; la publier, sous le
pr&eacute;texte qu'ils n'ont pas l'autorisation de l'auteur de le
faire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The letter is from a French girl who lives at St. Di&eacute;,
in Joan of Arc's region. I have never seen this French girl, but
she wrote me about five years ago and since then we have
exchanged friendly letters three or four times a year. She closes
her letter with this paragraph:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something in a newspaper that I read this morning has
surprised me very much. I have cut it out because, often, these
informations are forged and, if this is the case, the slip of
paper will be my excuse. Please, allow me to smile, my dear
unseen Friend! I cannot imagine for a minute that you have been
very sorry about it.--In France, such a measure would have for
immediate result to make every one in the country buy these
books, and I--for one,--am going to get them as soon as I go
through Paris, perfectly sure that I'll find them as wholesome as
all you have written. I know your pen well. I know it has never
been dipped in anything but clean, clear ink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I must go back now to that French cablegram. Its information
is not exactly correct, but it is near enough. <i>Huck Finn</i>
and <i>Tom Sawyer</i> are not recent books. <i>Tom</i> is more
than thirty years old. The other book has been in existence
twenty-one years. When Huck appeared, twenty-one years ago, the
public library of Concord, Massachusetts, flung him out
indignantly, partly because he was a liar and partly because
after deep meditation and careful deliberation he made up his
mind on a difficult point, and said that if he'd got to betray
Jim or go to hell, he would go to hell--which was profanity, and
those Concord purists couldn't stand it.</p>

<p>After this disaster, Huck was left in peace for sixteen or
seventeen years. Then the public library of Denver flung him out.
He had no similar trouble until four or five months ago--that is
to say, last November. At that time I received the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SHEEPSHEAD BAY BRANCH<br>
 BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY<br>
 1657 SHORE ROAD<br>
 BROOKLYN-NEW YORK, <i>Nov. 19th, '05</i></p>

<p>DEAR SIR:</p>

<p>I happened to be present the other day at a meeting of the
children's librarians of the Brooklyn Public Library. In the
course of the meeting it was stated that copies of "Tom Sawyer"
and "Huckleberry Finn" were to be found in some of the children's
rooms of the system. The Sup't of the Children's Dep't--a
conscientious and enthusiastic young woman--was greatly shocked
to hear this, and at once ordered that they be transferred to the
adults' department. Upon this I shamefacedly confessed to having
read "Huckleberry Finn" aloud to my defenseless blind people,
without regard to their age, color, or previous condition of
servitude. I also reminded them of Brander Matthews's opinion of
the book, and stated the fact that I knew it almost at heart,
having got more pleasure from it than from any book I have ever
read, and reading is the greatest pleasure I have in life. My
warm defense elicited some further discussion and criticism, from
which I gathered that the prevailing opinion of Huck was that he
was a deceitful boy who said "sweat" when he should have said
"perspiration." The upshot of the matter was that there is to be
further consideration of these books at a meeting early in
January which I am especially invited to attend. Seeing you the
other night at the performance of "Peter Pan" the thought came to
me that you (who know Huck as well as I--you <i>can't</i> know
him better or love him more--) might be willing to give me a word
or two to say in witness of his good character though he "warn't
no more quality than a mud cat."</p>

<p>I would ask as a favor that you regard this communication as
confidential, whether you find time to reply to it or not; for I
am loath for obvious reasons to bring the institution from which
I draw my salary into ridicule, contempt or reproach.</p>

<p>Yours very respectfully,</p>

<p>ASA DON DICKINSON.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That was a very private letter. I didn't know the author of
it, but I thought I perceived that he was a safe man and that I
could venture to write a pretty private letter in return and
trust that he would not allow its dreadful contents to leak out
and get into the newspapers. I wrote him on the 21st:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>21 FIFTH AVENUE,<br>
 <i>November 21, 1905</i></p>

<p>DEAR SIR:</p>

<p>I am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote Tom Sawyer and
Huck Finn for adults exclusively, and it always distresses me
when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them.
The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed
clean; I know this by my own experience, and to this day I
cherish an unappeasable bitterness against the unfaithful
guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled
me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years
old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again
this side of the grave. Ask that young lady--she will tell you
so.</p>

<p>Most honestly do I wish I could say a softening word or two in
defence of Huck's character, since you wish it, but really in my
opinion it is no better than those of Solomon, David, Satan, and
the rest of the sacred brotherhood.</p>

<p>If there is an unexpurgated in the Children's Department,
won't you please help that young woman remove Huck and Tom from
that questionable companionship? Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>(Signed) S. L. CLEMENS.</p>

<p>I shall not show your letter to anyone--it is safe with
me.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A couple of days later I received this handsome rejoinder in
return:</p>

 BROOKLYN-NEW YORK, <i>Nov. 23rd, '05</i></p>

<p>DEAR SIR:</p>

<p>Your letter rec'd. I am surprised to hear that you think Huck
and Tom would have an unwholesome effect on boys and girls. But
relieved to hear that you would not place them in the same
category with many of the scriptural reprobates. I know of one
boy who made the acquaintance of Huck in 1884, at the age of
eight, and who has known him intimately ever since, and I can
assure you he is not an atom the worse for the 20 years'
companionship. On the contrary he will always feel grateful to
Huck's father--I don't mean Pop--for the many hours spent with
him and Jim, when sickness and sorrow were forgotten.</p>

<p>Huckleberry Finn was the first book I selected to read to my
blind (for selfish reasons I am afraid), and the amount of
innocent enjoyment it gave them, has never been equalled by
anything I have since read.</p>

<p>Thanking you for the almost unhoped for courtesy of your
reply, I am</p>

<p>Yours very respectfully,</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Four months drifted tranquilly by. Then there was music! There
came a freshet of newspaper reporters and they besieged my
secretary all day. Of course I was in bed. I am always in bed.
She barred the stairs against them. They were bound to see me, if
only for a moment, but none of them got by her guard. They said a
report had sprung up that I had written a letter some months
before to the Brooklyn Public Library; that according to that
report the letter was pungent and valuable, and they wanted a
copy of it. They said the head officials of the Brooklyn Library
declared that they had never seen the letter and that they had
never heard of it until the reporters came and asked for it. I
judged by this that my man--who was not in the head library, but
in a branch of it--was keeping his secret all right, and I
believed he could be trusted to continue to keep that secret, for
his own sake as well as mine. That letter would be a bombshell
for me if it got out--but it would hoist him, too. So I feel
pretty confident that for his own sake, if for no other, he would
protect me.</p>

<p>My secretary had a hard day of it, but I had a most enjoyable
one. She never allowed any reporter to get an idea of the nature
of the letter; she smoothed all those young fellows down and sent
them away empty.</p>

<p>They renewed the assault next day, but I told her to never
mind--human nature would win the victory for us. There would be
an earthquake somewhere, or a municipal upheaval
<i>here</i><i>,</i> or a threat of war in Europe--something would
be sure to happen in the way of a big excitement that would call
the boys away from No. 21 Fifth Avenue for twenty-four hours, and
that would answer every purpose; they wouldn't think of that
letter again, and we should have peace.</p>

<p>I knew the reporters would get on the right track very soon,
so I wrote Mr. Dickinson and warned him to keep his mouth
hermetically sealed. I told him to be wise and wary. His answer
bears date March 28th.</p>

<p>BAY RIDGE BRANCH<br>
 BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY<br>
 73D STREET AND SECOND AVENUE<br>
 BROOKLYN-NEW YORK, <i>Mar. 28, '06</i></p>

<p>DEAR MR. CLEMENS:</p>

<p>Your letter of the 26th inst. rec'd this moment. As I have now
been transferred to the above address, it has been a long time
reaching me.</p>

<p>I have tried to be wary and wise and am very grateful to you
for your reticence. The poor old B. P. L. has achieved some very
undesirable notoriety. I thought my head was coming off when I
heard from my chief on the telephone night before last. But
yesterday he began to be amused, I think, at the teapot
tempest.</p>

<p>Last night I reached home at 11.30 and found a Herald man
sitting on the steps, leaning his head against the door post. He
had been there since 7.30 and said he would cheerfully sit there
till morning if I would give him the least hint of the letter's
contents. But I was wise and wary.</p>

<p>At the January meeting it was decided not to place Huck and
Tom in the <i>Children's</i> rooms along with "Little Nellie's
Silver Mine" and "Dotty Dimple at Home." But the books have not
been "restricted" in any sense whatever. They are placed on open
shelves among the adult fiction, and any child is free to read
adult fiction if he chooses.</p>

<p>I am looking forward with great eagerness to seeing and
hearing you to-morrow night at the Waldorf. As I have a wild
scheme for a national library for the blind, they have been
generous enough to place a couple of boxes at my disposal. The
"young lady" whom you mentioned in your letter--the Sup't of the
Children's Dep't--and several other B. P. L.'s, I hope will be
present.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to have caused you so much annoyance through
reporters, but be sure that I have said nothing nor will say
anything to them about the contents of that letter. And please
don't you tell on me!</p>

<p>Yours very respectfully,</p>

<p>ASA DON DICKINSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I saw him at the Waldorf the next night, where Choate and I
made our public appeal in behalf of the blind, and found him to
be a very pleasant and safe and satisfactory man.</p>

<p>Now that I have heard from France, I think the incident is
closed--for it had its brief run in England, two or three weeks
ago, and in Germany also. When people let Huck Finn alone he goes
peacefully along, damaging a few children here and there and
yonder, but there will be plenty of children in heaven without
those, so it is no great matter. It is only when well-meaning
people expose him that he gets his real chance to do harm.
Temporarily, then, he spreads havoc all around in the nurseries
and no doubt does prodigious harm while he has his chance. By and
by, let us hope, people that really have the best interests of
the rising generation at heart will become wise and not stir Huck
up.</p>

<p><i>Child's letter about "Huckleberry Finn" being flung out of
Concord Library.--Ambassador White's autobiography.--Mr.
Clemens's version of the Fiske-Cornell episode.--Another example
of his great scheme for finding employment for the
unemployed.--This client wins the Fiske lawsuit.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>When <i>Huck Finn</i> was flung out of the Concord Public
Library twenty-one years ago, a number of letters of sympathy and
indignation reached me--mainly from children, I am obliged to
admit--and I kept some of them so that I might reread them now
and then and apply them as a salve to my soreness. I have
overhauled those ancient letters this morning and among them I
find one from a little girl who resents that library's treatment
of Huck and then goes innocently along and gives me something
more of a dig than even the library had done. She says:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am eleven years old, and I live on a farm near Rockville,
Maryland. Once this winter we had a boy to work for us named
John. We lent him "Huck Finn" to read, and one night he let his
clothes out of the window and left in the night. The last we
heard from him he was out in Ohio; and father says if we had lent
him "Tom Sawyer" to read he would not have stopped on this side
of the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Bless her gentle heart, she was trying to cheer me up, and her
effort is entitled to the praise which the country journalist
conferred upon the Essex band after he had praised the whole
Fourth of July celebration in detail, and had exhausted his stock
of compliments. But he was obliged to lay something in the nature
of a complimentary egg, and with a final heroic effort he brought
forth this, "The Essex band done the best they could."</p>

<p>I have been reading another chapter or two in Ambassador
White's autobiography, and I find the book charming, particularly
where he talks about me. I find any book charming that talks
about me. I am expecting this one of mine to do something in that
line, and it is my purpose that it shall not lose sight of that
subject long at a time. Mr. White was the first president of
Cornell University, and he gives the university's side of the
Willard Fiske trouble. I stopped at that point. I didn't read his
version, for I want to give another version first, and as this
version may conflict with his, I wish to set it down now before
its complexion shall have a chance to undergo a change by coming
in contact with his version.</p>

<p>This brings me back to another example of my great scheme for
finding work for the unemployed. The famous Fiske-Cornell episode
of a quarter of a century ago grew up in this way. About fifty
years ago, when Willard Fiske was a poor and untaught and
friendless boy of thirteen, he and Bayard Taylor took steerage
passage in a sailing ship and crossed the ocean. They found their
way to Iceland, and Willard Fiske remained there a year or two.
He acquired the Norse languages and perfected himself in them. He
also became an expert scholar in the literature of those
languages. By and by he returned to America, and while still a
very young man and hardly of age, he got a place as instructor in
that kind of learning in the infant Cornell University. This seat
of learning was at Ithaca, New York, and Mr. McGraw was a citizen
of that little town. He had made a fortune in the electric
telegraph, and it was his purpose to leave a large part of it to
the university. He had a lovely young daughter, and she and young
Fiske fell in love with each other. They were aware of this; the
girl's parents were aware of it; the university was aware of it;
Ithaca was aware of it. All these parties expected Fiske to
propose, but he didn't do it. There was no way to account for it,
and so all the parties, including the girl, went on from month to
month and year to year in a condition of suppressed surprise,
waiting for the mystery to solve itself. Which it still didn't
do. At last Mr. McGraw died, and the fact developed that he had
left no will. Therefore the daughter was sole heir. However, she
knew what her father's intention had been, so she turned over to
the university a good part of the fortune and thus made the
intention good.</p>

<p>The years drifted along and the relations between Fiske and
Miss McGraw remained the same. But there was no proposal. Fiske
had a quite definite reason for not proposing. It was that he was
very poor and the girl very rich, and he was not willing to seem
to marry her for her money. This was good morals, good principle,
good sentiment--but it was not business. Things remained just in
this way for years and years, and the devotion of the couple to
each other went along unimpaired by time. At last, when they were
well stricken in years, and when Miss McGraw had developed
pulmonary consumption, she invited Fiske and Charles Dudley
Warner and his wife to make a trip up the Nile with her in the
old-fashioned dahabiyeh, a trip which occupied a matter of three
months. Miss McGraw had already been on the other side of the
ocean several months, and she had been buying all sorts of
beautiful things--pictures, sculpture, costly rugs, and so
on--wherewith to adorn a little palace which she was building in
Ithaca.</p>

<p>At last there on board the dahabiyeh a sorrowful time
came--for Miss McGraw's malady was making great progress and it
was manifest that she could not live long. Then she came out
frankly and said she wanted to marry Fiske so that she could
leave her fortune to him. Fiske wanted to marry her, but his
ideas remained unimpaired in his heart and head and he was not
willing to accept the fortune. The Warners wrought with him. They
used their best persuasions. He was as anxious for the marriage
as was Miss McGraw, but he wouldn't accept the fortune. At last
he was persuaded to a modification of the terms. He was willing
to accept the little palace and its furnishings and three hundred
thousand dollars; he would accept nothing more. The marriage took
place. Mrs. Fiske made a will, and in the will she left the
palace and its furnishings and three hundred thousand dollars to
her husband, Willard Fisk. She left the residue of the fortune to
Cornell University.</p>

<p>By and by Fiske arrived at an understanding of the fact that
he had not acted wisely. The income of three hundred thousand
dollars was wholly inadequate. He could not live in the Ithaca
house on any such income as that. He did not try to live in it.
There it stood, with all those beautiful things in it which Miss
McGraw had gathered in her travels in Europe, and Fiske lived
elsewhere--lived most comfortably elsewhere--lived where three
hundred thousand dollars was really a fortune, and he was
entirely satisfied. He lived in Italy. He was as dear and sweet a
soul as I have ever known. His was a character which won friends
for him, and whoso became his friend remained so, ever
afterward.</p>

<p>Now followed this curious circumstance. Cornell had received
by Mrs. Fiske's will a noble addition to its endowment--two
million dollars, if I remember rightly. No doubt Cornell
University was satisfied. But the university's lawyers, picking
and searching around through Mrs. Fiske's will, found a defect in
it which neither Mrs. Fiske nor Charley Warner, who drew the
will, suspected was there. It was something about "residue." It
was the opinion of those lawyers that the university might claim
the little palace and its rich equipment, and make the claim good
in a court of law.</p>

<p>The claim was put forward. Fiske and Warner were outraged by
this insolence, this greed. Both knew that it was the desire of
the dying wife that her husband should live in that house and
have the sacred companionship of those things which had been
selected by her own hands for its adornment. Both knew that but
for Fiske's stubborn resistance he would have had not only the
house, but a great sum of money besides, and now that the
university proposed to take the house away from Fiske--well, it
was time for the worm to turn. The worm turned. Fiske was the
worm. Fiske resisted the university's claim and the university
brought suit.</p>

<p>Now then, I must go back to a point antedating the bringing of
this suit three or four years. One day in Hartford a young fellow
called and wanted to see me. I think he said he was from Canada.
He said he had a strong desire, an irresistible desire, to become
a lawyer, and he thought that if he could get some work to do
that would support him, he could meantime use his off hours, if
he had any, in studying Blackstone. He thought he could be a
journalist. He thought he could at least become a good reporter,
and his idea was to get me to use my influence with the Hartford
newspaper people to the end that he might get the sort of chance
he was after.</p>

<p>I said: "Certainly, I will get you a berth in any newspaper in
the town. Choose your own paper."</p>

<p>He was very grateful. These clients of mine always are, until
they learn the conditions. I furnished him the conditions in the
same old way. He considered a moment and then said:</p>

<p>"How simple that is; how sure it is; how certain it is; how
actually infallible it is, human nature being constructed as it
is--how is it that that has not been thought of before?" Then he
added, as he went out of the door, "I choose the <i>Courant,</i>
and I will have the job before night."</p>

<p>About three months afterward he came out to report progress.
He had moved along so briskly, from sweeper-out, up through the
several grades, that he was now on the editorial staff, and was
very happy, particularly as staff work allowed him a good deal of
off time for the study of the law, and the law was where his high
ambition lay.</p>

<p>I come back now to that Fiske lawsuit. We had gone to Elmira
one summer to spend the summer, as usual, at Quarry Farm, and we
were visiting Mrs. Clemens's family down in the town for a while.
A young man called and said he would like to see me. I went to
the library and saw him there. It was the young man of whom I
have been talking, but as I had not seen him for three or four
years I did not at first recall him. He said that while he was on
the <i>Courant</i> he saved all the money he could, and studied
the law diligently in his off hours--that now, recently, he had
given up journalism and was going to make a break into the law;
that he had canvassed the field and had decided that he would
become office assistant to David B. Hill of Elmira, New
York--that is to say, he had decided to do this, evidently
without requiring Mr. Hill to state whether he wanted it so or
not. Hill was a very distinguished lawyer and a big politician, a
man of vast importance and influence--and he is still that
to-day, in his old age. The application was made and Hill said
promptly that he didn't need anybody's assistance. But young
Bacon said he didn't want any pay, he only wanted a chance to
work; he could support himself. He would do anything that could
be of any assistance to Mr. Hill, even to sweeping out the
office; that he wanted to work, and he wanted to be near a man
like Hill because he was determined to become a lawyer. Well, as
he was not expensive and showed a determination that pleased
Hill, Hill gave him office room. Very well, the usual thing
happened, the thing that always happens. Little by little Bacon
got to beguiling out of Hill things to do, and presently Hill was
furnishing him the things to do without any beguilement.</p>

<p>"Now then," Bacon said, "Mr. Clemens, I've got a chance--I've
got a chance." Professor Willard Fiske brought his case to Mr.
Hill. Mr. Hill examined it carefully and declined to take it. He
said Fiske had no case, and therefore he did not wish to take it
merely to lose it. Fiske insisted, and presently Hill said:
"Well, here's this young fellow here in my office. If he wants to
take your case, all right; I will advise him and help him to the
best of my ability without charge"; and he asked if Fiske was
willing to put the case into Bacon's hands. Fiske did it.</p>

<p>Then young Bacon had this happy idea. There being nothing for
Fiske in the apparent conditions, he went to the university
charter to see what he might find there. He found a very pleasant
thing there; to use a phrase of the day, he struck oil in that
charter. He brought the charter to Mr. Hill and showed him this
large fact: that Cornell University was not privileged to accept
or to acquire any property if, at the time, it already possessed
property worth three millions of dollars. Cornell University
possessed property worth more than that at the time that Mrs.
Fiske made her will, and it still possessed that amount.</p>

<p>Hill said, "Well, Bacon, the case is yours--that is to say,
well, Bacon, the case is Fiske's. It is the university, now, that
has no show."</p>

<p>Bacon won the case. It was his first case. He charged Fiske a
hundred thousand dollars for his services. Fiske handed him the
check, and his thanks therewith.</p>

<p>I didn't see Bacon again for some years--I don't know how
many--and then he told me that that first lawsuit of his was also
his last one; that that first fee of his was the only one he had
ever received; that he had hardly pocketed his check until he ran
across a most charming young widow possessed of a great fortune
and he took them both in. I think I will say nothing more about
my great scheme for providing jobs for the unemployed. I think I
have proven that it is a good and effective scheme.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, April 11, 1906</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Frank Fuller and his enthusiastic launching of Mr.
Clemens's first New York lecture.--Results not in fortune, but in
fame.--Leads to a lecture tour under direction of
Redpath.--Clipping in regard to Frank Fuller, and Mr. Clemens's
comments.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I am not glancing through my books to find out what I have
said in them. I refrain from glancing through those books for two
reasons: first--and this reason always comes first in every
matter connected with my life--laziness. I am too lazy to examine
the books. The other reason is--well, let it go. I had another
reason, but it had slipped out of my mind while I was arranging
the first one. I think it likely that in the book called
<i>Roughing It</i> I have mentioned Frank Fuller. But I don't
know, and it isn't any matter.</p>

<p>When Orion and I crossed the continent in the overland
stagecoach in the summer of 1861, we stopped two or three days in
Great Salt Lake City. I do not remember who the Governor of Utah
Territory was at that time, but I remember that he was
absent--which is a common habit of territorial Governors, who are
nothing but politicians who go out to the outskirts of countries
and suffer the privations there in order to build up States and
come back as United States Senators. But the man who was acting
in the Governor's place was the Secretary of the Territory, Frank
Fuller--called Governor, of course, just as Orion was in the
great days when he got that accident-title through Governor Nye's
absences. Titles of honor and dignity once acquired in a
democracy, even by accident and properly usable for only
forty-eight hours, are as permanent here as eternity is in
heaven. You can never take away those titles. Once a justice of
the peace for a week, always "judge" afterward. Once a major of
militia for a campaign on the Fourth of July, always a major. To
be called colonel, purely by mistake and without intention,
confers that dignity on a man for the rest of his life. We adore
titles and heredities in our hearts, and ridicule them with our
mouths. This is our democratic privilege.</p>

<p>Well, Fuller was acting Governor, and he gave us a very good
time during those two or three days that we rested in Great Salt
Lake City. He was an alert and energetic man; a pushing man; a
man who was able to take an interest in anything that was
going--and not only that, but take five times as much interest in
it as it was worth, and ten times as much as anybody else could
take in it--a very live man.</p>

<p>I was on the Pacific coast thereafter five or six years, and
returned to the States by the way of the Isthmus in January, '67.
In the previous year I had spent several months in the Sandwich
Islands for the Sacramento <i>Union,</i> and had returned to San
Francisco empty as to cash, but full of information--information
proper for delivery from the lecture platform. My letters from
the Islands had given me a large notoriety--local notoriety. It
did not extend eastward more than a hundred miles or so, but it
was a good notoriety to lecture on, and I made use of it on the
platform in California and Nevada and amassed twelve or fifteen
hundred dollars in the few nights that I labored for the
instruction and amusement of my public. Fifteen hundred dollars
was about half--the doorkeeper got the rest. He was an old circus
man and knew how to keep door.</p>

<p>When I arrived in New York I found Fuller there in some kind
of business. He was very hearty, very glad to see me, and wanted
to show me his wife. I had not heard of a wife before; had not
been aware that he had one. Well, he showed me his wife, a sweet
and gentle woman with most hospitable and kindly and winning
ways. Then he astonished me by showing me his daughters. Upon my
word, they were large and matronly of aspect, and married--he
didn't say how long. Oh, Fuller was full of surprises. If he had
shown me some little children, that would have been well enough,
and reasonable. But he was too young-looking a man to have grown
children. Well, I couldn't fathom the mystery and I let it go.
Apparently it was a case where a man was well along in life, but
had a handsome gift of not showing his age on the outside.</p>

<p>Governor Fuller--it is what all his New York friends called
him now, of course--was in the full storm of one of his
enthusiasms. He had one enthusiasm per day, and it was always a
storm. He said I must take the biggest hall in New York and
deliver that lecture of mine on the Sandwich Islands--said that
people would be wild to hear me. There was something catching
about that man's prodigious energy. For a moment he almost
convinced me that New York was wild to hear me. I knew better. I
was well aware that New York had never heard of me, was not
expecting to hear of me, and didn't want to hear of me--yet that
man almost persuaded me. I protested, as soon as the fire which
he had kindled in me had cooled a little, and went on protesting.
It did no good. Fuller was sure that I should make fame and
fortune right away without any trouble. He said leave it to
him--just leave everything to him--go to the hotel and sit down
and be comfortable--he would lay fame and fortune at my feet in
ten days.</p>

<p>I was helpless. I was persuadable, but I didn't lose
<i>all</i> of my mind, and I begged him to take a very small
hall, and reduce the rates to side-show prices. No, he would not
hear of that--said he would have the biggest hall in New York
City. He would have the basement hall in Cooper Institute, which
seated three thousand people and there was room for half as many
more to stand up; and he said he would fill that place so full,
at a dollar a head, that those people would smother and he could
charge two dollars apiece to let them out. Oh, he was all on fire
with his project. He went ahead with it.</p>

<p>He said it shouldn't cost me anything. I said there would be
no profit. He said: "Leave that alone. If there is no profit that
is my affair. If there is profit it is yours. If it is loss, I
stand the loss myself, and you will never hear of it."</p>

<p>He hired Cooper Institute, and he began to advertise this
lecture in the usual way--a small paragraph in the advertising
columns of the newspapers. When this had continued about three
days I had not yet heard anybody or any newspaper say anything
about that lecture, and I got nervous. "Oh," he said, "it's
working around underneath. You don't see it on the surface." He
said, "Let it alone; now, let it work."</p>

<p>Very well, I allowed it to work--until about the sixth or
seventh day. The lecture would be due in three or four days
more--still I was not able to get down underneath, where it was
working, and so I was filled with doubt and distress. I went to
Fuller and said he must advertise more energetically.</p>

<p>He said he would. So he got a barrel of little things printed
that you hang on a string--fifty in a bunch. They were for the
omnibuses. You could see them swinging and dangling around in
every omnibus. My anxiety forced me to haunt those omnibuses. I
did nothing for one or two days but sit in buses and travel from
one end of New York to the other and watch those things dangle,
and wait to catch somebody pulling one loose to read it. It never
happened--at least it happened only once. A man reached up and
pulled one of those things loose, said to his friend, "Lecture on
the Sandwich Islands by Mark Twain. Who can that be, I
wonder"--and he threw it away and changed the subject.</p>

<p>I couldn't travel in the omnibuses any more. I was sick. I
went to Fuller and said: "Fuller, there is not going to be
anybody in Cooper Institute that night, but you and me. It will
be a dead loss, for we shall both have free tickets. Something
must be done. I am on the verge of suicide. I would commit
suicide if I had the pluck and the outfit." I said, "You must
paper the house, Fuller. You must issue thousands of
complimentary tickets. You <i>must</i> do this. I shall die if I
have to go before an empty house that is not acquainted with me
and that has never heard of me, and that has never traveled in
the bus and seen those things dangle."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with his customary enthusiasm, "I'll attend
to it. It shall be done. I will paper that house, and when you
step on the platform you shall find yourself in the presence of
the choicest audience, the most intelligent audience, that ever a
man stood before in this world."</p>

<p>And he was as good as his word. He sent whole basketsful of
complimentary tickets to every public-school teacher within a
radius of thirty miles of New York--he deluged those people with
complimentary tickets--and on the appointed night they all came.
There wasn't room in Cooper Institute for a third of them. The
lecture was to begin at half past seven. I was so anxious that I
had to go to that place at seven. I couldn't keep away.</p>

<p>I wanted to see that vast vacant Mammoth Cave and die. But
when I got near the building I found that all the streets for a
quarter of a mile around were blocked with people, and traffic
was stopped. I couldn't believe that those people were trying to
get into Cooper Institute, and yet that was just what was
happening. I found my way around to the back of the building and
got in there by the stage door. And sure enough, the seats, the
aisles, the great stage itself, was packed with bright-looking
human beings raked in from the centers of intelligence--the
schools. I had a deal of difficulty to shoulder my way through
the mass of people on the stage, and when I had managed it and
stood before the audience, that stage was full. There wasn't room
enough left for a child.</p>

<p>I was happy, and I was excited beyond expression. I poured the
Sandwich Islands out on to those people with a free hand, and
they laughed and shouted to my entire content. For an hour and
fifteen minutes I was in Paradise. From every pore I exuded a
divine delight--and when we came to count up we had thirty-five
dollars in the house.</p>

<p>Fuller was just as jubilant over it as if it had furnished the
fame and the fortune of his prophecy. He was perfectly delighted,
perfectly enchanted. He couldn't keep his mouth shut for several
days. "Oh," he said, "the fortune didn't come in--that didn't
come in--that's all right. That's coming in later. The fame is
already here, Mark. Why, in a week you'll be the best-known man
in the United States. This is no failure. This is a prodigious
success."</p>

<p>That episode must have cost him four or five hundred dollars,
but he never said a word about that. He was as happy, as
satisfied, as proud, as delighted, as if he had laid the fabled
golden egg and hatched it.</p>

<p>He was right about the fame. I certainly did get a working
quantity of fame out of that lecture. The New York newspapers
praised it. The country newspapers copied those praises. The
lyceums of the country--it was right in the heyday of the old
lyceum lecture system--began to call for me. I put myself in
Redpath's hands, and I caught the tail end of the lecture season.
I went West and lectured every night, for six or eight weeks, at
a hundred dollars a night--and I now considered that the whole of
the prophecy was fulfilled. I had acquired fame, and also
fortune. I don't believe these details are right, but I don't
care a rap. They will do just as well as the facts. What I mean
to say is, that I don't know whether I made that lecturing
excursion in that year or whether it was the following year. But
the main thing is that I made it, and that the opportunity to
make it was created by that wild Frank Fuller and his insane and
immortal project.</p>

<p>All this was thirty-eight or thirty-nine years ago. Two or
three times since then, at intervals of years, I have run across
Frank Fuller for a moment--only a moment, and no more. But he was
always young. Never a gray hair; never a suggestion of age about
him; always enthusiastic; always happy and glad to be alive. Last
fall his wife's brother was murdered in a horrible way.
Apparently a robber had concealed himself in Mr. Thompson's room,
and in the night had beaten him to death with a club. A couple of
months ago I ran across Fuller on the street, and he was looking
so very, very old, so withered, so moldy, that I could hardly
recognize him. He said his wife was dying of the shock caused by
the murder of her brother; that nervous prostration was carrying
her off, and she could not live more than a few days--so I went
with him to see her.</p>

<p>She was sitting upright on a sofa and was supported all about
with pillows. Now and then she leaned her head for a little while
on a support. Breathing was difficult for her. It touched me, for
I had seen that picture so many, many times. During two or three
months Mrs. Clemens sat up like that, night and day, struggling
for breath. When she was made drowsy by opiates and exhaustion
she rested her head a little while on a support, just as Mrs.
Fuller was doing, and got naps of two minutes' or three minutes'
duration.</p>

<p>I did not see Mrs. Fuller alive again. She passed to her rest
about three days later.</p>
