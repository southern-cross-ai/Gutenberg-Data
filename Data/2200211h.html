<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. The Happy Man</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>There had been much ado about a stool. You see during all the
twenty odd years that Mr. Journ&eacute;e had been in business he
had directed operations seated on a wooden box, that had eventually
become polished to a beautiful brown shine by the friction of his
pants. But when his son Anthony returned from college&mdash;where
only by exercising the most rigid economies had his father been
able to send him&mdash;and entered the workshops, the stool became
a mild centre of discord. Anthony resented his father sitting on
the box. There seemed something discreditable about it. At
Rainsworth College, where he had fairly distinguished himself,
people didn't sit on boxes. It was not as though there were no
chairs about. There were several in that part of the workshop which
served as a kind of reception-room. There were two even of a period
somewhere about the respectable Mr. Chippendale. But when his son
suggested a substitution he said no. He had always sat on the box,
and it was quite good enough for him. He was quite huffy about it,
which for a man of his equable and lovable nature was
remarkable.</p>

<p>Anthony made several more hints, but they were of no avail. Then
he adopted a very astute move. He waited until Christmas, and then
on Christmas morning he presented his father with a beautiful
circular mahogany stool with a green plush seat. He said: "I
thought you might like this, dad, to sit on in the shop."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was cornered for the moment. He coughed and
spluttered out vague thanks. It was very good of the boy, of
course, very good indeed. H'm! Yes, well, well&mdash; When business
was resumed after Christmas the stool was substituted for the box.
But as the days went by it became apparent that Mr. Journ&eacute;e
was not happy about it. He fidgeted restlessly upon his stool, and
appeared preoccupied as though unable to concentrate on his work.
And a week later Anthony found him seated once more on the box,
with the stool tucked away under the bench. He said nothing, but he
felt angry.</p>

<p>Now we have not sufficient evidence to convict Anthony of the
disaster which happened the next morning, but it is certain that
his sympathy appeared a little strained at the time. For when Mr.
Journ&eacute;e went to sit down, there was a sudden crash, and the
top of the box fell in, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e with it. When he
picked himself up he called out:</p>

<p>"Who has been monkeying with this box?"</p>

<p>Anthony, who had been working on a clay model a dozen yards
away, hurried forward and helped to rectify the disturbance, but,
of course, he knew nothing about it. Mr. Journ&eacute;e growled and
carried the box to another part of the workshop and with his own
hands&mdash;he was a good workman&mdash;he repaired the box, and by
an arrangement of splats and screws he made the box strong enough
to support a he-elephant. And that was the end of that. Anthony
gave up, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e continued to sit on the box to the
end of his days.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It might be advisable at this point to give a rough description
of Mr. Journ&eacute;e's workshops. They were situated down a narrow
cul-de-sac called Glaize Yard. You came to a black fence on which
was inscribed: "Paul Journ&eacute;e, architectural carver in wood
and stone." You entered an untidy yard, rendered unduly untidy by
the prodigal litter of loose plaster. In the summertime the plaster
blew about and covered everything like a frost. In the winter it
was dangerous to walk on it on account of the slipperiness. The
yard was filled with blocks of Portland stone, planks of timber,
and dilapidated plaster-casts. The workshops were in a buff brick
building on two floors. The ground floor was devoted to plaster,
stone, and sometimes marble. The floor upstairs was devoted to the
noble purposes of fashioning wood, that loyal and ancient friend to
man. It was a long narrow workshop with benches all along the wall
under the window, with rows of gouges and wood-carvers' tools
neatly arranged in front of each workman. The brick walls were
distempered an Indian red, and on them were a bewildering number of
casts, scraps of carving, sections of volutes, capitals, cornices,
cherub's heads, acanthus scrolls, lions rampant, and lions
couchant, and other heraldic devices, rough charcoal drawings,
architectural photographs, and full-size details.</p>

<p>The other side of the long workshop had a socially and
intellectually elastic character. For it had to express various
activities without definite lines of demarcation. At the further
end was a sink and some pegs, where the workmen washed and hung up
their clothes. Then came two long benches covered with drawings and
books, at which Mr. Journ&eacute;e and an old draughtsman, named
Lintot, used to work. At the back of these benches were two white
pine chests, a grandfather clock, and an oak chest. Then there came
a break in the wall, and the workshop began to take on a slightly
different character. One was slowly approaching the social and
business end of the workshop, near the entrance door. A deal bench
was covered by a piece of green baize, on which reposed pens, ink,
books, and correspondence. It was here that Mr. Journ&eacute;e
conducted the administrative side of his business, seated on his
wooden box. After that the workshop culminated in a surprising
touch of the magnificent. For one thing there was a square of
carpet, projecting sufficiently far out so that the wood-carvers
could avoid it when passing in and out. There was a fine old walnut
tallboy, another eight-day clock, three barometers, two Louis XVI
mirrors, a large framed print of the Colosseum at Rome, an
oil-painting by an unknown Italian painter, an ebony and ivory
Venetian chair, and three other old chairs. This was in effect Mr.
Journ&eacute;e's reception-room, where he interviewed his clients,
who were mostly architects.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The incident about the stool had a disturbing effect on Mr.
Journ&eacute;e. It was not that he regarded it as important in
itself as that it symbolized a disquieting side of his son's
nature. He himself was proud of his craft, of his good name, of his
Huguenot stock. The Journ&eacute;es had been English craftsmen of
some sort ever since the days of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.
He was a simple man, with a simple outlook, and passionately
devoted to his wife and son. It had been one of his great ambitions
that his son should take his place and carry on the fine tradition
of his calling. But a few months' service in the workshop gave
evidence that the young man was restless. It was not that he showed
any lack of ability. He gave promise of being an extremely
brilliant draughtsman. He was quick and clever in every way. But
the father became subtly aware that the son in some way despised
the business, and was even slightly contemptuous of himself. His
own education had been of a very sketchy nature. He had had to earn
his own living since he was fourteen. He occasionally dropped his
"h's," and invariably his "g's." He dressed in a slightly eccentric
manner, and was not alive to the finer meanings of social life. But
in these matters he could find nothing important. He was wrapped up
in his work.</p>

<p>When he had married at the age of twenty-four, he had been a
journeyman wood-carver, earning tenpence an hour. His wife Bessie
was the daughter of a piano-tuner. They lived in two rooms in
Kentish Town, and the boy was born the following year. The early
struggles of the young couple were severe. Being a journeyman
carver he was always liable to an hour's dismissal, and when work
was scarce he would frequently be out of employment for months. It
says a good deal for the courage and faith of this young workman
and the devotion and loyalty of his wife that they emerged from
these conditions successfully. At the age of twenty-six, a relative
died and left him seventy-five pounds, and he immediately set up in
business for himself. He worked in a kind of scullery in the
basement of the house where their lodgings were. He traipsed the
streets of London with samples and photographs of his work, and
called on innumerable architects. For the most part he was received
with indifference if not with rebuffs, frequently with that
chilling formula: "Very well. Leave your name and address. If an
opportunity occurs, Mr. So-and-so will let you know."</p>

<p>He was at that time a tall, clumsily-built young man,
high-shouldered, and too long in the thin flanks. When he walked
his spindley legs seemed to be shaking in disgust at the eager
onrush of those hunched shoulders and that keen projecting chin.
The face was narrow, and the nose and ears too large. His untidy
black hair, which was short behind, fell in unmanageable strands
across his temples and deep brown eyes. He looked like a gentle and
reflective vulture, if you can conceive such a thing. But in this
grim struggle to improve the lot of his kind he had one invaluable
asset. Old Lintot&mdash;who was devoted to him&mdash;used to say in
after years:</p>

<p>"Where the guv'nor gets away with it is that he <i>believes
in</i> things."</p>

<p>And he just went on <i>believing</i> in things. He had a simple
reverence for names, traditions, and beauty in every form. Not
understanding much, he felt it all intensely. His dreams were
coloured by magic yearnings. And because he believed in his dreams
he gradually influenced others to believe in him. Sometimes at
night when he and his wife were discussing how they could possibly
buy boots for the growing boy, they would suddenly change the
subject and talk eagerly about the wonderful trip they were going
to make to Italy "one day." They had got on. The boy had been sent
to a public school, but the dream of the trip to Italy had not yet
materialized.</p>

<p>The disturbing thoughts that crept into the mind of Paul
Journ&eacute;e when meditating upon his son's attitude, centred
round a recurring doubt, a doubt that&mdash;well, with all his
cleverness, his brilliance, his learning, did the boy really
<i>believe</i> in things?</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>If Anthony's advent to his father's workshop opened
inauspiciously it did in any case have one bright aspect to it, for
it synchronized with a wave of comparative prosperity. It was as
though nature, preparing this youth for a brilliant career, was
deliberately determined to see that his setting should always be
appropriate. Soon after his arrival the father received a large
order for carving on a municipal building in the Midlands, and soon
after another large order for carved chair-backs. This latter
demand came through Justin McGrath. The McGraths were the
Journ&eacute;es' closest and most intimate friends. Justin was a
chairmaker with premises in the neighbourhood. He and his wife were
much older than the Journ&eacute;es, and they had a daughter named
Laura. Laura was a sweet-tempered, rather plain girl in her
twenty-seventh year. She appeared to be considerably older, as a
result, no doubt, of living her life and submerging it in the lives
of two much older people. The old couple adored their daughter, and
were entirely oblivious of how much they preyed upon her youth and
vitality.</p>

<p>The two families supped together at least once a week, and
looked in on each other at odd hours of the day and night. Mr.
Journ&eacute;e always referred to Mr. McGrath as "the old 'un."
These two elderly craftsmen would sit over their pipes in the
evening and discuss Wren, and Jean Goujon, and Viollet-de-Duc. And
they would lend each other books, over which they would pore, books
with illustrations of Italian palaces, and sculpture, and gardens,
of French cathedrals, and Spanish iron. They were neither of them
of a keenly critical nature. They admired everything, as though
hushed into a profound reverence for the past. Mr. Journ&eacute;e
would adjust his spectacles and exclaim:</p>

<p>"By Jove, old 'un, here's a fine frieze!"</p>

<p>And Mr. McGrath would adjust his, and make little clucking
sounds of approbation. They belonged to a guild where men of their
kind foregathered, and read papers and held discussions on the
subjects which interested them. They went for a walk together
regularly every Sunday morning in Regent's Park, whilst their wives
prepared the Sunday dinner. Sometimes they allowed their minds to
wander in abstract speculations. They touched on politics,
religion, philosophy, and life, and so came to know each other.</p>

<p>During this year of Anthony's experiment in the workshop, the
slow-moving mind of Mr. Journ&eacute;e became quietly occupied with
a plan for the realization of a dream. For he was a careful man,
and, as Lintot said, "never put his leg over the stile till he
could see the other side." But things were going well, very well,
better than they had ever gone before. After paying his workmen on
Saturday morning he went carefully into his accounts. He made
calculations and estimates. Yes, it could be done. It was now the
end of February. He wouldn't tell Bessie. He would wait till April.
She would be so bitterly disappointed if it didn't come off. Lintot
and the foreman, Greville, would manage somehow. They would go off
for a month. They should realize that honeymoon dream of over
twenty years ago&mdash;a month in Italy. Rome, Padua, Florence,
Venice, Sienna. He could almost see the white palaces glistening in
the sun, the cypress-trees, the olive groves. He could almost hear
the low, musical cry of the gondoliers, as they glided their craft
down dimly-lighted canals out into the moon-flooded mystery of the
Venetian night, where the festival is held under the shadow of the
Santa Maria della Salute.</p>

<p>He suffered agonies of restraint in not breaking the news to his
wife, but the months went by and April came. One Sunday morning
when the daffodils were out in the Park, where he was walking with
his friend McGrath, he suddenly thought: "I will tell her
to-night." But he said nothing to McGrath. He felt it would be in
some way mean to let anyone know until he had told her.</p>

<p>After tea that evening Anthony followed him into the
drawing-room. The mother was washing up. He said:</p>

<p>"Father, can I have a bit of a jaw with you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e said: "Of course, my boy."</p>

<p>The young man seemed a little self-conscious and on edge. He
suddenly blurted out:</p>

<p>"You know, I don't think I'm going to be any good at this
business. It bores me."</p>

<p>An expression of troubled disappointment came into the eyes of
Mr. Journ&eacute;e, but he answered quietly:</p>

<p>"What do you want to do, Anthony?"</p>

<p>"Father, you've been&mdash;been doing pretty well lately,
haven't you? Couldn't you afford to send me to Paris? I'd like to
go over there and study to become a painter. I know two other chaps
going in the spring."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e looked into the bowl of his pipe. He took a
long time to answer and when he did he said:</p>

<p>"Anthony, is it that you <i>really</i> want to become a painter?
It isn't, is it, that you think you would just like to lead that
kind of life?"</p>

<p>"No. I've got ambitions. I feel cramped here. Everyone says I
have talent, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true."</p>

<p>He paused again and fumbled with a match.</p>

<p>"I want you to do what you think is right, my boy. I shall have
to think this over."</p>

<p>And the young man went out, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e sat there
thinking. He could hear his wife singing over the clatter of the
teacups. Paris, eh? Of course, the boy must choose his own career.
But&mdash;Paris! this would mean a lot of expense, years and years
and the uncertain life of a painter. Of course, the boy's career
was more important than&mdash;than their pleasures. But that would
be the end of Italy&mdash;for the time. He poked the fire and
watched the grey ash fall into the pan. After a time his wife came
in. He said:</p>

<p>"Well, mother, finished?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, there wasn't much to do."</p>

<p>The tones of his voice seemed a little clouded as, after a
pause, he said:</p>

<p>"The McGraths are coming in to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad."</p>

<p>A happy smile lighted the face of Mrs. Journ&eacute;e, as she
picked up her work-basket, and took her accustomed seat facing her
husband.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Anthony was away until July, when he returned for a month's
holiday. The two families shared a furnished house at Angmering for
the month of August, with a rather surprising result. For Anthony
and Laura fell in love. The boy had been working hard, and he was
obviously keen and ambitious. The father was pleased to see that it
was, indeed, "the thing itself" his son was seeking, and not the
attractive features of a student's life in Paris. He had not felt
justified in allowing him more than just sufficient to live on
comfortably, and he had not got into debt. Although more animated
and eager in his manners, his attitude was, if anything, graver
than it had been before he went away. He was obviously in earnest.
Well, well, in that case the postponement of the trip to Italy was
justified. Business would improve, the boy would get on, the day
would not be far distant. Neither Mr. Journ&eacute;e nor Mr.
McGrath could spare a whole month from their business. They stayed
a fortnight and came down for the following two weekends. It was on
that first week-end, after they had been a week in town, that the
truth was brought home to them.</p>

<p>It came about most unexpectedly. Anthony and Laura had known
each other for years, and had never once regarded each other in any
other light than as good friends. She was seven years older than
he.</p>

<p>But there is something about the seashore which has always
proved a source of trouble to wayward hearts. After four months'
separation their meeting had about it an element of novelty. They
saw each other in a new light. There were aspects about his
Parisian experiences which caused Anthony to react rather violently
to this familiar, simple-minded girl friend. He had found himself
over there a little shy, home-sick, and bewildered. Everyone seemed
so clever, so sophisticated, so very much a part of it all. He had
not made many friends, and his knowledge of French was very
imperfect.</p>

<p>One morning, lying on the beach after bathing, he looked at
Laura, who was lying on her back by his side, taking a sun bath.
She was wrapped up in a towel, but her legs and arms were bare. Her
healthy plump face was framed in loose brown hair drying in the
sun. Her arms were stretched out, and her eyes closed, giving the
impression of complete contentment. Her little pink feet were
diapered with sand.</p>

<p>He looked away for a moment at the sea, and felt something queer
stir within him. Why had he never thought of this before?</p>

<p>This happened during the first week of his stay. Angmering is a
small place, and the days are idle. He had no other companions of
his own age. Even if&mdash;even if nothing came of it, it was
obviously the pleasantest way to pass one's time. They went for
rambles on the dunes, and lay side by side beneath the tamarisks.
And he told her eagerly of his life in Paris, his ambitions, and
his hopes. And he took her hand, and romped with her, as brothers
and sisters do. And still she did not see.</p>

<p>She was a difficult girl to flirt with. She accepted everything
as a literal statement. Her large, grey, innocent eyes seemed proof
against the most subtle erotic shafts. She was desperately
happy!</p>

<p>One thing concerning her irritated him. He could not get her to
come out with him in the evening. She would not leave her mother.
In the raw daylight he still felt a little self-conscious. He had
not had the experience to carry this thing by storm without the aid
of darkness. When it came to the question of any kind of
protestation of this new-found passion he felt quite inarticulate.
Perhaps there warred within him two forces uncertain of each other,
a subconscious egoism that did not mean to be denied, and an
unfamiliar passion he knew not how to interpret.</p>

<p>One night, however, the opportunity he was seeking occurred. She
had finished a game of bezique with her mother, and dashed out
hatless to the post. He followed, and at the angle of the road
called after her. She stopped and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tony, are you coming with me?"</p>

<p>He said "Yes" in a husky voice, and caught hold of her by the
forearm. They were by the side of a steep grass bank that walled-in
someone's garden. She noticed something strange about his pale face
in the moonlight, and she said:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>For answer he threw his other arm around her, and kissed her
clumsily on the cheek. And still he could see that she did not
understand. She said:</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble, Tony?"</p>

<p>He tried to kiss her on the lips then, but she turned her cheeks
away, and raised her arms between them.</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" he exclaimed almost angrily.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I love you, Laura."</p>

<p>But when the words left his lips they did not sound as he meant
them to sound. They were less like an avowal of love than a
complaint of ill-treatment. But he saw her start, as though
awakened from a dream. She looked at him, with her lips
half-parted. She was probably blushing, but he could not be
certain. She muttered: "Oh, my dear, I did not know. You
mustn't&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;" She hurried across the road to
the pillar-box, and he followed her in silence.</p>

<p>When the letter was posted, and they were returning, they walked
arm in arm, but he did not try to kiss her again. They walked back
without speaking. He could see her bosom heaving, and her eyes were
bright. At the gate she gave his hand a tight little squeeze and
hurried in.</p>

<p>And as each of them fell asleep that night they both shared an
emotion in common. It was an emotion which had in it something of
an unknown blinding ecstasy; but the ecstasy of one was tinged with
contentment and a profound happiness; the ecstasy of the other with
a sense of fear and vague unhappiness.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Before the return of the two fathers the following Saturday,
things moved with surprising rapidity. It took Laura two days to
begin even to unravel the skeins of emotion which had suddenly
entangled her. Love! She had read about love in books&mdash;when
she had time to escape from her domestic obligations. She had even
dreamed of love as a remote passion applying to far-off people. But
to come upon <i>her</i> like this!</p>

<p>It was all wild and foolish. She was in any case much too old
for Anthony, much too plain and dull. Nevertheless, the next
morning she regarded him in an entirely new light. He had become
very good-looking of late. Paris had improved him. Everyone said he
was brilliant; that he had a brilliant career before him. Things
came his way. He was quick, clever, and charming in manners when he
wanted to be. She watched his lithe boyish figure sprinting across
the sands. She saw the laughter and the love-light in those keen,
dark, rather mysterious eyes. She liked him next to her, and what
he said aroused a thousandfold more interest than it had done the
previous day. She thought about him, and thought, and thought. And
she thought about herself, and her father and mother, and her God.
And a new book in her life seemed to be opened.</p>

<p>The first night she would not go out with him after supper, but
the second night she did. The old ladies went to bed very early.
They had all been for an excursion. Laura wanted to know, wanted to
hear, in any case, how people spoke when they were in love. She
wanted to hear how Anthony spoke. And that night he was eloquent
enough. For he took her down on to the sandbanks and kissed her on
the lips. She found herself clinging to him, and when he said he
loved her, his voice was vibrant and convincing. For the first time
she heard the voice of a lover speaking.</p>

<p>After that there was no pretence. Laura was incapable of
pretending, and Anthony had no desire to. They spent the day
rejoicing in each other, regardless of the glances of onlookers.
For the first time in her life Laura neglected her mother in the
evenings. At first the old lady did not understand. She became
peevish and querulous. But Mrs. Journ&eacute;e was quicker in her
perceptions. She did not rely upon her son with that
taken-for-granted assurance that her friend relied upon her
daughter. Perhaps for this reason she observed him more
objectively. She was more sensitive to the shifts of his moods. She
saw him again and again holding Laura's hand, gazing into her
eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>And she thought: "Oh, dear! oh, dear! I wish it was Saturday and
Paul was here." She was unused to grappling with any emotional
experience without her husband's help. This was tremendous,
cataclysmic, almost beyond itself. Her Anthony! Nancy's Laura! And
Laura was so much older&mdash; She could not face it.</p>

<p>It was not until she was enveloped in comfortable darkness, in
her own bed, on the Saturday night, and her husband was lying by
her side, that she unburdened herself. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was at
first inclined to laugh about it.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there is anything in it, mother," he said.
"Young people, you know, the sea air and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was quite patently excited about it. To think
that his son and Justin's daughter&mdash;after all these years. Of
course, the girl was older than the boy, but still&mdash; He told
his wife about a new job he expected to get, a carved staircase for
a rich South African. He thought it well to distract her attention.
She might not sleep. She had probably not been sleeping too well.
He felt a tinge of conscience that he should have been absent, when
she was assailed by this emotional upheaval.</p>

<p>In the morning, he was up early, anxious to take his bearings.
Justin came down later and after breakfast the two families
wandered down to the beach. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was preoccupied. His
fellow-guildsman wanted to tell him about a contract that a firm of
decorators had secured by bribing a consulting architect, and also
about a sale of furniture that was coming off the following week in
Hanover Square, but Mr. Journ&eacute;e's eyes were intently fixed
upon two figures prancing about on the shore, and lying side by
side against the breakwater, and his mind was occupied with doubts
and misgivings. "Suppose he gets tired of her&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the afternoon he went for a walk by himself. Alone amidst the
murmur of the sea, and the intermittent screaming of the gulls, he
thought the thing out.</p>

<p>"No, I shan't tell the old 'un. It wouldn't be fair. He'll never
notice. It will probably all blow over. I would trust Laura. But
she's seven years older&mdash; Anthony might get tired of her. He's
clever. Poor Laura girl, you're dull and not too pretty. Of course,
if it had all been just the other way about or in any case a little
different&mdash; My son and his daughter! But we must try and do
the right thing, eh, old man? If the boy says anything I shall try
and dissuade him. When he gets back to Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hummed to himself perplexedly. In this great open space the
world seemed very vast&mdash;vast and mysterious&mdash;and yet
somehow wonderfully satisfying. The tamarisks nodded in the breeze,
and the sun began to set.</p>

<p>"Life is very beautiful," he thought. "I mustn't let mother
worry."</p>

<p>And then he went back home, for with all its beauty, nature, as
he saw it then, seemed lacking in something.</p>

<p>The families spent a quiet evening. The two young ones
disappeared soon after supper, and the four elders devoted the
evening to a sleepily conversational game of whist. At half-past
ten Mrs. Journ&eacute;e declared for bed, and the McGraths followed
her. Mr. Journ&eacute;e said he would sit up a bit and read. The
night was warm, and he sat near the window turning over the sheets
of a Sunday newspaper which he had already read once. After a time
he heard the garden gate click, and two people come whispering up
the path. They stood near the window which was open, and he drew
back into the room. It was not his place to overhear. He heard the
front door open and shut, and two people tiptoeing up the stairs.
He must have dozed after that, for the room seemed cold, when, with
a start, he heard his name called, and, looking up, saw Justin
standing by the door. The old 'un was in a dressing-gown, looking
tousled, but somehow very agitated. He came straight up and,
without any preliminaries, tapped him on the shoulder and said
excitedly:</p>

<p>"Paul! Paul, old man. Do you know that our two children are
engaged?" And he held out his hand.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was a man who extracted extreme delight out
of small things. It was an intense pleasure to him to polish his
boots&mdash;he never allowed anyone else to touch his square-toed
brown boots&mdash;brush his clothes, or clean out his pipe. When he
came down in the morning at Angmering he would stroll out into the
garden, take several deep breaths in a way someone had shown him,
do a few clumsy exercises, and then light his pipe for a few whiffs
before breakfast. He would stand there in the sun, blinking at the
flowers or the glittering dew on a spider's web, and feel good.
Nature felt good to him, because he never questioned her
prescriptions. He liked to feel life pouring through him, and he
the reverent medium for life's expression.</p>

<p>Before Anthony returned to Paris he enjoyed many such mornings.
His early misgivings were overcome by the contagious optimism of
the rest, and particularly of his old friend Justin. Justin
dismissed the question of the difference in the ages of the young
people as of little consequence. They were both young in his eyes,
so what did a mere matter of seven years make in a lifetime? In his
opinion it was an ideal match. His wife agreed with him, only
adding a hope that they would not marry "for a long, long time." As
for Mrs. Journ&eacute;e, she wept a little when she heard that the
affair was already settled, but she did not let her husband see her
tears.</p>

<p>That the affair would not happen for a long long time was fairly
obvious. Anthony had only just begun to study for one of the most
precarious professions in the world, and neither of the parents was
in a position to set the young couple up in a life partnership. It
gave Mr. Journ&eacute;e an opportunity of giving his son a broad
hint that he should forego his extravagant ambitions, and return to
the workshops. It was a solider career. In only a few years' time
he might be able to make him a partner, and then he could marry and
settle down. At the expression "settle down," Anthony tossed his
head. He said that he had no intention of settling down, even when
married. Settling down meant curbing your ambitions, becoming a
cabbage. Mr. Journ&eacute;e didn't quite understand what he meant.
He said defensively that there was "no harm in anyone having a
touch of cabbage about them."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, having once acquiesced in the affair, Mr.
Journ&eacute;e subscribed to it whole-heartedly. He was as excited
as a schoolboy. He kissed Laura and already began to treat her as
his own daughter. He playfully ragged his wife about it, and felt
drawn closer than ever to his old friend. And in his morning
walk&mdash;he always did a mile walk before starting his day's
work&mdash;he dreamt of this new-born happiness the earth was
producing, and of his grandchildren&mdash;what he would do for
them. Perhaps by that time the business would be paying well. He
visualised soft clinging little limbs about his knees, and baby
voices calling "Grandpa!" Anthony went back to Paris with his
ambitions; but he left his heart behind, and also a beautiful gold
ring set with a pearl and two small rubies (paid for by his
father). It was all very rapid. But as Mr. Journ&eacute;e said, "It
was not as though they had only <i>known</i> each other a
month."</p>

<p>Two years passed rapidly and uneventfully. He and Laura
corresponded frequently. We must not pry into these letters, but
their devotion was apparent and constant. Laura began studying all
the art books she could borrow, and she made frequent visits to the
National Gallery and the Wallace Collection. She could already
distinguish between a Raphael and a Raeburn. She was preparing
herself as the wife of a famous painter.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. McGrath had a mild paralytic seizure. She was
confined to bed for several months. Laura waited on her day and
night. Coming out of the house one night and standing by the hall
door, where Laura was seeing him off, Mr. Journ&eacute;e suddenly
thought:</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Poor Laura, how she's ageing. She must be over
thirty, but she looks&mdash;she looks anything to-night. Those dark
lines round her eyes. It's quite time she was married&mdash;"</p>

<p>The problem began to obsess him. Anthony was getting on well.
But&mdash;well, he had not sold a picture yet, and was not likely
to for some time. His own business was going fairly well, but
nothing to write home about. Old McGrath had his hands full to keep
things going. But he would like the boy to get married. He spent
long hours over his books, and his calculations. It was certain
that he and his wife couldn't do that Italian trip until the young
couple were launched. But still&mdash;</p>

<p>If only the boy would settle down a bit. It would be as cheap to
keep them both in London as to keep the boy in Paris. If they could
manage not to have children for a year or two, for instance; or,
for that matter, why shouldn't Laura go to Paris?</p>

<p>Returning home one Sunday morning from their weekly walk, he
said:</p>

<p>"Old un, I think it's time those children got married."</p>

<p>"Eh? what's that?" said Justin. "Married! But surely Anthony
could hardly&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was impossible for Mr. Journ&eacute;e to explain that he was
thinking less of his son in the matter than of his friend's
daughter. He pretended to a greater state of affluence than he had
any claim to. After a good deal of misgiving he offered to set the
young people up "in a modest way" until such time as Anthony should
be in a position to support the household. The old 'un almost shed
tears of gratitude. It would certainly be very desirable. He
deplored the fact that he could do so little himself. He would
however, do what he could. Mrs. McGrath, on the other hand, offered
every objection. It was wrong, for young people to marry without
means. Besides, what was going to happen to her?</p>

<p>"I married when I was earning tenpence an hour," argued Mr.
Journ&eacute;e. And as a bright after-reflection he suggested that,
perhaps, they would agree to live with Mr. and Mrs. McGrath so that
Laura could still carry out her filial obligations. When Anthony
came home for the Christmas holidays the proposal was put to him,
and to everyone's surprise he accepted it.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Anthony and Laura were married the following Easter. The
ceremony was carried out with as much &eacute;clat as the means of
the parties concerned allowed for. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was all for a
little show. He liked the ceremonial and sentimental side of it. He
bought a tailcoat and a top-hat. A wedding cake was ordered, and
they were married in a church. The ceremony was followed by a
wedding breakfast to which some fifteen guests were invited. Mr.
Journ&eacute;e was up early in a great state of excitement. Being a
nervous man he fussed over every little detail. He was the kind of
man who, when he had to catch a train, was always at the station at
least three-quarters of an hour before the train was due to start.
And at the wedding he was ready at least two hours too soon,
fussing about and calling out:</p>

<p>"Now then, Mary, has that claret come yet? Mother, are you
nearly ready? Anything I can do, my dear? God bless my soul! we
haven't any cigarettes for the young men. Where's Anthony? You mean
to say the boy's not up yet! Does he know it's <i>his</i> wedding
and not mine? Anthony! Anthony!"</p>

<p>Anthony took no pains to show that all this fuss was distasteful
to him. He regarded it as frankly Philistine, not to say, common.
He would have liked to have been married at a registrar's office,
and to have quietly slipped away. He was in a perfect dread that
his father would want to make a speech at the wedding breakfast,
saying silly and sentimental things and dropping his "h's" and
"g's" all over the place. Fortunately, there would be no one there
who mattered. He thought, however, that it was advisable to give
way on certain points, as he had been somewhat lordly in his terms
in agreeing to the wedding at all. He had agreed that he and his
wife should live with the McGraths, on the understanding that he
had a studio out. He had, indeed, become a little tired of Paris,
and the idea of marriage seemed to present a pleasant change. He
was anxious, too, to work on his own, unrestricted by French
professors.</p>

<p>His attitude at the wedding breakfast was, rather, one of bored
tolerance. He did not know that his father had actually rehearsed a
speech. Mr. Journ&eacute;e wanted to talk about love and happiness,
about his own married life, and his long friendship with the
bride's father. When he got upon his legs, however, his eye
alighted on his son's face, and he merely stammered:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the toast of the bride and
bridegroom."</p>

<p>Everyone cheered and raised their glasses and there were loud
calls for a speech from the bridegroom, but the latter merely shook
his head and smiled uncomfortably. He was anxious to be off.</p>

<p>When they left there was the usual tragic-comic parting
associable with such events. The funny man and some of his friends,
to whom it meant just a wedding, some of whom had drunk a little
too much and were hilarious; the Journ&eacute;es and McGraths
rather pathetically trying to be gay; Mrs. McGrath weeping a little
when she kissed her daughter; the bride radiantly happy and trying
not to cry; Mr. Journ&eacute;e showing meticulous interest in all
the details of their journey to the Isle of Wight, where they were
going for the honeymoon, and all the time deeply stirred by the
larger aspects of the great affair; the bridegroom posing as
essentially the man of the world, to whom being married was an
everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>They went at last, and the guests gradually departed. Mr.
McGrath went too, as he had to see a man on business. The two
mothers sat in the drawing-room and talked. The evening crept on.
Mr. Journ&eacute;e put on his hat and strolled across to his
workshops, which had been closed for the day in honour of the
event. He let himself in and went upstairs.</p>

<p>Deep in thought, he paced the long, narrow shop. On the other
side of the yard were other workshops, from which came the sound of
someone beating on iron. It had a soothing rhythmic sound. He
became subtly aware of the smell of wood. Wood! all his life had
been spent under the smell of wood. At the end of the shop was a
heap of pine shavings. He went up and stirred them affectionately
with his foot. Then he strolled along the benches, examining the
men's work.</p>

<p>"H'm!" he thought, "Dawes is getting too much relief into the
scroll. Some of these fellows get a tool in their hand and there's
no holding 'em. I must tell him. By Jove! that's a lovely
egg-and-tongue! Charlie's cutting that beautifully. That young man
will get on. I shall have to give him another twopence an hour
soon. Sievewright's clamped this baluster in a funny way. I don't
see how he's going to get at it. Must ask him to-morrow."</p>

<p>He put on his steel-rimmed spectacles, and examined Lintot's
drawing.</p>

<p>"Now where has that old man got that detail from? It's not
Gibbons. It's not even Inigo Jones. Clever old rascal though!
Expect he has some authority."</p>

<p>He wandered down towards the administrative side of the shop.
Suddenly he caught sight of a stool beneath his writing-bench.
Quite mechanically he pulled it out and examined it. It was a
circular mahogany stool with a green plush seat. He had forgotten
all about it. It still looked bright and new and somehow
uncompanionable. He turned it over and muttered:</p>

<p>"H'm, yes, very good of the boy, very good, of course."</p>

<p>Then he tucked it away in the place from which he had taken it.
The workshop seemed to get a little lonely then. He lighted his
pipe, the match flickering impatiently over the bowl, as though the
hand that held it was not quite steady. Then he pulled his large
slouch hat over his eyes and went out.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Work is the social leaven that keeps men and women sane. Some
people avoid it and become degenerates. Others abuse it and become
unbalanced. It was work which kept the eye of Mr. Journ&eacute;e
bright, whilst his son was away on his honeymoon. It was work which
drove Anthony back from his honeymoon, rather precipitately a week
before he was due. He had become restless. After a few days at the
sea, he became convinced that there was no need for the delights of
early married life to interfere with the thrust of his ambitions.
He had seen the great world, and he desired to be part and parcel
of it. His fingers itched to express something that should be
noticed&mdash;something that would make his name. Laura talked of
her home, and what she would do with the rooms allocated to them,
and how she would manage details that seemed hardly worth worrying
about to Anthony. He had already, in imagination, designed the
place they would live in when he was famous. He visualised
receptions where all the notabilities foregathered, and he and
Laura standing at the top of a noble staircase receiving them. He
could already hear the hushed whispers of the crowd: "Look! there
he is, that's Anthony Journ&eacute;e!"</p>

<p>The explanation of their return was perhaps a little lame, but
it satisfied the parents. When Mr. McGrath said raggingly:</p>

<p>"What my dear, tired of honeymooning already?"</p>

<p>She blushed and whispered:</p>

<p>"It didn't seem important being down there, dad. Our life is
going to be one long honeymoon. Besides, Anthony naturally wants to
get on with his work, and I must get the place straight."</p>

<p>They both set about their respective duties with avidity. The
person most delighted to see them back was old Mrs. McGrath.
Nothing had been right while Laura was away. She could never find
anything. Her food was never cooked properly. Her husband was out
all day and the servant neglected her, and was rude and
careless.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't come back soon, my dear, I'm sure I should have
been really seriously ill."</p>

<p>All that was soon put to rights. Anthony went off to his studio
directly after breakfast and returned in time for dinner in the
evening. This in itself was an innovation to the McGraths and the
Journ&eacute;es, who were accustomed to have their dinner midday.
Anthony was not made aware of the time and attention devoted to his
mother-in-law. The rooms he lived in were clean and bright and
comfortable. His dinner was always excellently cooked and served.
He did not know that it was the second hot meal his wife had cooked
that day. Indeed, he made no inquiries at all about the domestic
details of the McGrath household. He arrived home rather surly and
preoccupied. Laura soon discovered that it was better to say little
to him till he had fed. After dinner he would stretch himself, talk
glib satisfaction about his day's work, be a little amorous, smoke
many cigarettes, read the newspaper, and go to bed.</p>

<p>Laura was perfectly happy. In only one particular did she find
her union with Anthony disconcerting. And that curiously enough was
in connection with his work.</p>

<p>She had taken great pains to attain some understanding of the
old masters. And to her alarm she found she was all wrong. Anthony
seemed to have no great respect for the old masters. He spoke of
them superciliously, in the same tone that he spoke of the
McGrath's and Journ&eacute;e's relatives and friends. It was as
though he had something up his sleeve about them that it was hardly
worth his while to impart to her. His own work seemed quite
incomprehensible. He painted in the manner of some French school
she had not heard of. It impressed her as being curiously angular
and unconvincing. Neither did he ever seem very anxious that she
should come round to his studio. If she went, he would kiss her and
play with her hair, but he made no attempt to explain his work. It
appeared to be the kind of painting that was done by a certain set,
and which, in a few years' time, would become all the rage.</p>

<p>But if Laura was bewildered by her husband's surprising
productions, Mr. Journ&eacute;e was even more so. He arrived all
aglow to observe his son's progress. He was given to understand
that he principally painted interiors, and he envisaged an
immature, but promising display of works in the manner of Pieter de
Hoogh. Instead of which he found himself regarding most astonishing
daubs of pink and green, tables all out of perspective, curious
patterns, intending to represent herrings and teapots and such-like
things.</p>

<p>In his naivet&eacute; he asked what it was all about, and
Anthony simply shut him up. He told his father he knew nothing
about art, and was very rude to him. It was the unpleasantest
interview that had ever taken place between father and son.
Discussing it that night with old McGrath&mdash;he had forgiven his
son by then&mdash;he said:</p>

<p>"I don't know, old 'un, I'm sure. It seems to me funny stuff.
Founded on nothing. Of course, I may be wrong. I've been brought up
to believe in tradition. But perhaps we're getting out of date, old
'un. The boy says it's the thing that's coming. He talks above my
head. I've never yet heard of anything good coming out of nothing.
But we may be wrong. Life is very mysterious. These young
people&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and blinked at the gas chandelier.</p>

<p>"Do people buy that kind of thing?" grunted the old 'un.</p>

<p>"Ah! that I don't know. He said nothing about that."</p>

<p>"He said nothing about it!"</p>

<p>The two elderly gentlemen sat there in silence; Mr. McGrath
surprised that his friend should show so little sympathy for the
interests of his daughter; Mr. Journ&eacute;e wondering whether the
long tradition of craftsmanship he had the honour to represent was
going to end in abortion or genius.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>It was a strange two years which followed this union of the
Journ&eacute;es and McGraths. Beneath the surface of apparent
success there was a disturbing undercurrent. Over many pipes Mr.
Journ&eacute;e often pondered whether he had been wise in sending
his son to a public school, in allowing him to go to Paris, in
lavishing upon him more than the surplus of his hard-earned gains.
He had read somewhere a line which ran: "Each man kills the thing
he loves," and the phrase haunted him. At the same time he felt
that Anthony was in some queer way beyond him. He felt a little
proud&mdash;as people always do&mdash;of producing something he
didn't understand. And it produced in him a certain sense of
egotistical vanity to be able to tell his friends that his son was
going to be a painter, that he had been to Paris, and that he had a
studio of his own. After his own hard lot and struggles it appeared
to him a piquant luxury to be the parent of such a situation.</p>

<p>He buried himself in his workshops, making large charcoal
drawings of pediments and friezes, supervising the workmen, getting
out estimates of cornices and egg-and-dart at so much per foot. He
kept his accounts&mdash;seated on his wooden box&mdash;paid his
men, interviewed architects, got out quantities for builders, and
discussed detail with Lintot. The business fluctuated. Sometimes he
was very busy, sometimes very slack. On the whole doing fairly
well.</p>

<p>He would have been really in a position to put money by, but for
the expenses of his married son. It was not that the boy was
extravagant in himself&mdash;his domestic expenses were negligible,
thanks to Laura. But his muse appeared to be an eccentric mistress.
She required an enormous number of canvases and strange colours,
and materials. And occasionally it appeared to be imperative that
the young artist should go over to Paris or Munich. He always went
by himself, and usually returned more reserved and aloft than
usual, more oblivious to his surroundings. He began to develop a
personality that could only be described as exotic. There were
lines of insolent beauty about his face and the poise of his head.
Also he made friends in Chelsea and Kensington, people of a wealthy
aesthetic set. He never took his wife there, and hardly ever
referred to them among his own family. It was as though he
considered it impossible to explain. These were two alien worlds.
In the one he was loved, and love is a quality common to the
masses. In the other he was admired, and admiration is a quality
reserved for the few.</p>

<p>It was old McGrath who began to kick against the situation. A
child was expected. And as he said to his friend one night:</p>

<p>"Paul, how much longer is this monkeying about with new art
going on? What is going to happen when the child comes? It's unfair
on you."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e frankly didn't know what to do. He wanted to
do the best for the boy. It was not as though he were indolent or
dissolute. He worked very hard and was very keen. It was true he
didn't understand his son's work. But he might be wrong. He knew
that he mixed with people who were much talked about and who
admired his son, who avowed that he had genius. But the time must
come when ways and means would have to be considered. One day he
decided that he would take his son to task and thrash the whole
matter out.</p>

<p>He said nothing to his wife at supper-time. He felt nervous. He
thought out carefully just what he would say to his son, the
questions he would put, the advice he would give&mdash;he was a
difficult boy to talk to. He was always slightly apprehensive that
his son was laughing at him deep down in his soul, that he meant
nothing to him at all, except as a rather foolish means to an
enigmatic end.</p>

<p>After supper he put on his hat and toddled across to the
McGraths. Old Justin turned on the light in the hall, and opened
the door to him. He said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, old 'un, is the boy in?"</p>

<p>Old McGrath stared for a moment as though hardly recognising
him. Then he said: "No. He left this afternoon for Paris. He said
it was very important. He borrowed ten pounds from me."</p>

<p>Then, melting to a different mood, the old man seized his hand
and added:</p>

<p>"Come in Paul. Laura's very bad."</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The child&mdash;a boy&mdash;was born forty-eight hours later,
after what the doctor described as "a very difficult case." Anthony
had not returned. They wired to him, and received a reply the
following day: "Congratulations, love, wiring later, Anthony." They
heard no more from him for four days, and there was a distinct rift
in the lute of family affection. Laura made no complaint.</p>

<p>"He is busy," she said. "Besides, what good can he do? He will
come soon."</p>

<p>She was, perhaps, too blinded by this magic bundle of delight
that had so abruptly, painfully, and mysteriously thrust itself
into her life to be unduly perturbed by the absence of her husband.
But Mrs. McGrath complained that she thought it was "a very curious
way of going on," and Mr. McGrath was righteously indignant. He was
even inclined to blame Mr. Journ&eacute;e, as though he considered
that he was partly to blame.</p>

<p>If you thrust a stick into an ants' nest and stir it up the ants
immediately start rebuilding. But human creatures are not so
recuperative. It takes time for their emotions to focus before
building work can be even considered. It seemed a curiously hard,
cruel stick that Anthony had suddenly thrust into this nest,
unnecessarily cruel and thoughtless, to say the least of it. Fancy
deserting one's wife in such a crisis, going off without
explanation, and sending such a bald telegram!</p>

<p>On the fourth day, however, the further telegram as promised
arrived. Its contents were equally astonishing. It ran: "Sold
picture <i>petit salon</i> fifteen thousand francs, writing, love,
Anthony." On the receipt of this telegram the ants immediately
foregathered and tried to piece their emotions into a workable
form. Laura exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad for him. He will be so happy, poor dear.
He's sure to come back soon now."</p>

<p>And she went on feeding the baby. Mr. McGrath said:</p>

<p>"Good gracious me!" and he took out an envelope and, on the back
of it, he rapidly calculated that the sum meant something between
four and five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>They all agreed&mdash;they were all anxious to&mdash;that this
accounted for everything. Anthony had had an appointment with some
wealthy client, whom he had gone over to meet. But why had he said
nothing about it? Mr. Journ&eacute;e was very perplexed. So far as
he knew, his son had never sold a thing in his life, and this
seemed a vast sum for a novice. Of course, he was glad, glad, very
glad. It meant that he was wrong. There must be something in the
boy's work after all. At the same time he couldn't help feeling
that&mdash;well, he wished he hadn't gone off like that. He wasn't
sure that he wouldn't rather have had the boy stick by his wife and
not sell the picture, even at a loss to himself.</p>

<p>It was not till three days later that the letter came to Laura.
She did not show it to the others, but she tried to tell them the
gist of it. It seemed rather a confused description, affecting as
it did, various people they had not heard of. There appeared to be
an Italian countess, who was a sculptress and lived in Chelsea. She
had a great friend in Paris, another Italian woman, the wife of a
wealthy South American. She adored the "Vortex School," and had
bought works by Pinneti, Lammonde, and Sasha McFay, three of the
greatest exponents. It was she who had introduced Anthony to the
South American. He had been to stay with them at Fontainebleau. The
outcome was the sale. She was likely to buy more. He hoped to
return the following week&mdash; There was nothing more in the
letter that Laura quoted, and it was the quick eye of Mr.
Journ&eacute;e that detected a tear hovering near her lash as she
finished.</p>

<p>"Damn the boy!" he thought as he turned away.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Who were all these people, Pinneti, Lammonde, Sasha McFay? What
in God's name was the Vortex School? Why was Anthony running about
the Continent with Italian countesses, when he should be dancing
attendance on his wife? Mr. Journ&eacute;e was seriously alarmed.
The act seemed to mark the first definite line of cleavage between
his son's life and his own. He recalled vividly the night when
Anthony was born. He was out of work at the time, and they were
living in poor lodgings in Kentish Town. He had only a few pounds
in the world. He remembered his feverish pacing of the streets, his
tearing anxiety, his complete sense of helplessness. He ate nothing
for twenty-four hours. He remembered in a spasmodic fit of
abstraction, going out late in the afternoon and selling a marble
clock that had been given him by an uncle as a wedding present, for
fifteen shillings. He remembered turning the fifteen shillings over
in his hand, staring hard at it, regarding it
lovingly&mdash;another tiny bulwark to protect his wife's life. He
remembered his reward&mdash;that blinding ecstasy in the early
hours of a Sunday morning. She was well, well, and the child
lived&mdash;nothing else mattered! He had got work soon after and
their marital bliss had not been obscured for one hour.</p>

<p>And Anthony? Was it just Anthony, or was it the gesture of this
modern generation that had lost the sense of tradition? From what
he could see of them, looking around, they seemed to be thin,
evanescent people, irreverent, respecting neither themselves, nor
others, nor the past. They lived in postures, and phrases, and a
kind of morbid self-analysis unconnected with life. It was
deplorable. He had never met these people except by hearsay and
books and the theatre. He had hardly accepted them as reality. It
had taken his son's defection to bring home to him the truth that
such people lived.</p>

<p>Amidst the shavings, the smell of wood, and the sound of mallets
striking gouges, he decided that he would have it out with Anthony
when he returned. Unfortunately it was a full week before this
happened, and by that time his anger&mdash;as usual&mdash;had
abated. He yearned for his son, and wanted to see him again.</p>

<p>Anthony returned nonchalantly, as though his behaviour had been
quite normal. He went in to see his wife and child, and later in
the evening the two families sat round Laura's bed, and he became
quite eloquent. It was true that he only talked about himself, but
the father could not resent a sneaking pride in his son. There was
about him a certain richness of personality, a definite promise of
distinction. He was no ordinary young man. The world, so hard to
others, had to make allowances for such a creature. He had sold two
other pictures to this Madame Forzamba, the wife of the South
American. He had returned enriched by over a thousand pounds!</p>

<p>He did not seem to regard it as very remarkable, merely the
natural due to his genius. He said nothing about repaying his
father, or making other arrangements for his family. He took a
perfunctory interest in the baby, and said he should like to see it
painted by Lammonde.</p>

<p>The next morning he was at his studio, working feverishly. He
never went to his father's workshop, or inquired what he was doing.
The next evening he went to Chelsea and did not get home till three
in the morning.</p>

<p>This went on for several days. He spent an hour or two with his
wife, but finding that she was most inconveniently bedridden for
the time being, he dined out in the evening and came home late.
When with the family he sat around like one doped. He gazed at the
poorly furnished rooms, and could hardly conceal the expression of
disgust upon his face. It was apparent that he was in an atmosphere
entirely uncongenial and distasteful to him. His mind was wandering
elsewhere. On the fourth evening, Mr. Journ&eacute;e met him going
out. He went straight up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Anthony, come over to the shop. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>There was a hard drawn line about the father's mouth. They
walked over in silence and went upstairs. The men had gone. Mr.
Journ&eacute;e lighted a gas-jet and said:</p>

<p>"Sit down."</p>

<p>They were both terribly self-conscious, as between two men fond
of each other, but separated by a wide gulf of unfamiliar
experience. After a time Mr. Journ&eacute;e said:</p>

<p>"Anthony boy, I don't think&mdash;I don't think you're quite
playing the game. You went off like that and left Laura just when
she&mdash; We all feel it very much&mdash;your mother,
too&mdash;"</p>

<p>He coughed, and Anthony shifted uneasily in his seat. He said in
a weak voice:</p>

<p>"I had to. It was business, you know."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of you being interested in business before.
Talking of that, boy, I think now that you&mdash;that you
are&mdash;well, beginning to make a move. I think it's up to you to
keep your wife and child. Mother and I have been only too happy
that we could help a bit&mdash;you know, when you really needed it.
But business is not too good. We have to think of old age and
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes of course," said Anthony, and there was a meaningless,
non-committal pause. In Mr. Journ&eacute;e's voice there suddenly
came a more vibrant note.</p>

<p>"But, Anthony boy, I don't really care so much about that. It's
you I'm thinking of. This set you get in to. I know nothing about
it. Only I don't&mdash;I don't&mdash;I'd rather you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e became inarticulate. Under the flickering
light of the one gas-jet he could just see the dark, mocking eyes
of his son. And in the son's voice there crept a note of querulous
anger.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said, and stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was about to reply, also on a note of anger.
Then he looked down at the blotting-paper on the desk in front of
him. After a pause he said resignedly:</p>

<p>"No, I suppose I don't understand."</p>

<p>He looked crumbled and careworn. Anthony edged towards the door.
The situation was intolerable. With his hand on the latch he
said:</p>

<p>"Good-night, father!"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e did not look up. He replied quietly:</p>

<p>"Good-night!"</p>

<p>After he had gone, Mr. Journ&eacute;e continued to stare at the
blotting-paper. Once he mumbled to it:</p>

<p>"No, I suppose I don't understand."</p>

<p>Out in the street Anthony picked up a vagrant taxi. To the man
he cried angrily:</p>

<p>"Drive like blazes to the Caf&eacute; Royal!"</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>That Laura had some curious appeal for him was incontestable.
For a few weeks after she was up and about again he actually took
her to call on his friend, the Countess Strozzetti, at Chelsea. How
much he was influenced by the interview with his father it is
impossible to say. But in his own way he certainly gave evidence of
certain feelings of remorse at his behaviour. He was too proud or
too egoistic to say anything about it, but he paid more attention
to his wife. He bought her a necklace, and suggested that they
should take a house of their own in the neighbourhood. But this, of
course, raised the old difficulty of Mrs. McGrath. The old lady,
however, was overridden in her wishes by the other members of the
family. It was pointed out to her that it was only fair, since
Anthony was wishing to play the game, that he should be allowed a
home of his own. Moreover, being in the neighbourhood, Laura could
pop in every day for such time as she could spare from the
baby.</p>

<p>They, therefore, rented a seven-roomed semi-detached house less
than half a mile away, and at the next quarter-day Anthony wrote
quite a polite note to his father and said that he thought he
should be able to manage all right now, and at the same time he
thanked him for all his kindness in the past. It was the kind of
thing he could write to his father, but which he would have been
much too self-conscious to say. But the gesture alone made Mr.
Journ&eacute;e very happy. A good boy, Anthony, a splendid chap!
Just had his head a wee bit turned by this sudden and facile
success. Of course, he had never meant to act like that. Returning
from their guild meeting that night&mdash;where the paper had been
on "French engravings of the seventeenth and nineteenth
centuries"&mdash;Mr. Journ&eacute;e discussed it with Justin.</p>

<p>"What I object to about these new-fangled movements is just that
very thing; it has no relation to true values. When we started in,
old 'un, we were paid according to our worth&mdash;starting at
fivepence and sixpence an hour&mdash;this, mind you, after serving
a long apprenticeship without payment. We had to learn our
job&mdash;a recognised job with a tradition behind it. We didn't
suddenly make a thousand pounds like a stockbroker. To whom can a
painting of a beginner like Anthony possibly be worth four hundred
pounds or more? It's an artificial growth on the side of true
art."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was rather pleased with this last phrase, and
he repeated it. And Justin, knocking his pipe out against a
lamp-post, said:</p>

<p>"Yes, not only on the side of art, too, Paul; on the side of
society. It is impossible to teach this younger generation that
nothing comes out of the blue. They believe it does. Sometimes they
snatch something out of the blue. They think they've found the
divine afflatus. Instead of that it's a thunderbolt, and it
destroys them. We've linked up, you see, linked up with the dead
and&mdash;the unborn."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e accompanied his friend home. They found Mrs.
McGrath sitting by the fireside knitting.</p>

<p>"Well, Nancy," said Mr. Journ&eacute;e, "how are&mdash;" he was
about to say "the children," but feeling that it might be an
embarrassing question he altered it to "things?"</p>

<p>Mrs. McGrath had a queer puzzled look on her face. She said with
what was for her considerable animation:</p>

<p>"Anthony has taken Laura out to a party&mdash;some of his
friends in Chelsea."</p>

<p>The two fathers looked at each other. They could not have
appeared more surprised if Mrs. McGrath had informed them that he
had taken her to the South Pole. Mr. McGrath sat there with his
mouth open. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was about to utter an exclamation
but thought better of it. He yawned, and said casually:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nice&mdash;that's very nice."</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Anthony explained to his wife that it wasn't a party they were
going to, it was just a "studio evening." One didn't have to dress.
She had never heard of a "studio evening," and she didn't like to
ask what it meant. Nevertheless, she felt all agog, a little
flustered and nervous, but terribly proud that Anthony should
condescend to take her to meet his friends. She wore her best
frock, and examined her face carefully in the mirror. It was some
time since she had taken such a close personal interest in her own
face. She noticed the little sharp-cut lines developing beneath her
eyes, the tiny cracks along the brow, the slightly puffy chin. It
was no good. She was beginning to show her age. And yet she felt
happy and high-spirited. There was nothing to be ashamed of in
getting old. She thought of a child's book illustration she had
seen years ago. "Jane is a good girl and has a kind face." Perhaps
she looked like that.</p>

<p>She had, in any case, a handsome and clever husband, a child, a
home. One couldn't expect everything.</p>

<p>They arrived at the studio just before ten, and there were
already about twenty people there. The first thing that struck her
was that their hostess, a large dark, rather handsome woman, with a
suspicion of down on her upper lip, called Anthony "Pan." Her
greeting was:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pan! Good egg!" and then catching sight of Laura, she
said: "Is this the wife? How nice!"</p>

<p>She shook hands, and, without waiting for any further greeting,
she continued:</p>

<p>"Lobby is being perfectly absurd. He keeps on giving an
imitation of Sarah Bernhardt, and it's no more like her than it is
like George Robey. I wish you'd shut him up, Pan."</p>

<p>When Laura had had time to focus the room and the company, she
found herself in a most astounding environment. Several women were
sitting straddle-legged on cushions on the floor, drinking coffee
or beer; others were lolling on ottomans or against easels.
Everyone seemed to be leaning against something. There was a loud
buzz of talk, frequently broken by strident laughter. A
swarthy-looking Jewish man, in a black shirt and a black scarf with
no apparent collar, was talking to a thin woman with a dead white
face and carmine lips. A fierce-looking man, with a square blond
beard, was striking his left palm with his right fist and
declaiming:</p>

<p>"My dear nincompoop, James Branch Cabell is not a romanticist.
He's a mountebank."</p>

<p>A large-eyed young man listening to him appeared to be about to
burst into tears. A pretty woman, who looked like a mischievous
linnet, with bright eyes, caught hold of Anthony and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pan, how are you, darling?"</p>

<p>She was about to dart away without waiting for an answer, when
Anthony grabbed her. He said:</p>

<p>"Come here, you little devil! This is my wife. Laura, this is
Gina Cherbourg, one of the worst adventuresses in London!"</p>

<p>Gina squealed with laughter, and held out her hand to Laura.</p>

<p>"Nice!" she said. "Have some coffee?"</p>

<p>Laura felt it incumbent upon her to try and adapt herself to her
surroundings. She said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like some, please."</p>

<p>The linnet darted away, but she was caught by two young men in
plus fours, one of whom was wearing a monocle. It looked curiously
out of place. He said to the linnet:</p>

<p>"Darling, I haven't seen you for a week. Keep still. I want to
make love to you."</p>

<p>The other young man turned away, as though this type of
conversation bored him. Catching sight of Anthony, who was standing
at his elbow, he grunted:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pan!"</p>

<p>Anthony said: "Look after my wife a minute. I want to talk to
Bistowe."</p>

<p>The young man turned to Laura and gave a stiff little bow. He
looked at her closely, and she was fully conscious of having his
entire disapproval. She could see him desperately trying to think
of something to say. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Do you know the Challices?"</p>

<p>"No," said Laura.</p>

<p>This reply also seemed to meet with his disapproval. He
said:</p>

<p>"We had an awful binge there last night."</p>

<p>Laura didn't know what a "binge" was, but she said politely
enough:</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>After that the conversation lapsed. She saw Anthony across the
room, the centre of a group. She couldn't hear what he was saying,
but he was making them all laugh. He seemed to be imitating
someone's broken English. A large man, with a walrus moustache, was
splitting with laughter, and kept slapping Anthony on the back and
exclaiming: "Good! good! excellent!"</p>

<p>The linnet had forgotten all about Laura's coffee, but a
schoolboy, very proud of his office, was handing round cakes. He
offered her some and she said:</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," and took a piece.</p>

<p>After a considerable interval of neglect, the hostess came up to
her with a thin, sad-faced man who looked terribly ill. She
said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Journ&eacute;e, I want to introduce you to an old friend
of your husband's, Bernard Ossip. Bernard, this is Pan's wife!"</p>

<p>The melancholy man looked doubtfully at his hostess and
said:</p>

<p>"I didn't know he had a wife"; then, taking her hand, which he
squeezed very hard between his bony fingers, he exclaimed: "Well,
I'm damned!"</p>

<p>They were left alone, and he continued:</p>

<p>"Paint at all?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all."</p>

<p>He nodded, as much as to imply that anyone could see that. Then
he appeared to rouse himself from his stupor, and said with a
degree of animation:</p>

<p>"Your husband's a genius. I was with him in Paris. We shared an
apartment in the Rue Visconti."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," said Laura, who seemed now to have vaguely
heard the name Ossip mentioned once. Anthony's friend
proceeded:</p>

<p>"Have you seen the Sasha McFay's at Ryders?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "not yet."</p>

<p>He nodded again, as though realising that he had asked a foolish
question. After a pause he said: "I don't know whether Pan told
you. I've been very bad, you know&mdash;kidneys; doctor thought I
had Bright's disease."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry," said Laura, really meaning it.</p>

<p>"It pulls you down so. Anything to do with the kidneys is always
depressing. You have to stick to a diet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about to enter into further details about his kidneys,
when a girl in a jade green frock went to the piano, and sang a
French song. It was charmingly done, and the company all laughed at
the various sallies. Laura laughed too. It was funny, it was all
very funny, but&mdash;why had Anthony married her?</p>

<p>She caught sight of his handsome face, silhouetted against a
dark curtain. He was so very much at home here, so different, so
animated, so happy. These people understood him, and liked him. It
wasn't all his fault, poor boy! What was she going to do? She could
never fit in. It was an utterly different world she found herself
in, and it was Anthony's world. It couldn't be helped.</p>

<p>Going home in the cab he did not seem dissatisfied with her. He
did not say much, but he was in good spirits. He had drunk quite a
number of glasses of <i>cr&ecirc;me-de-menthe</i>, and he kissed
her rather sloppily on the lips. She made no protest.</p>

<p>The next morning her mother said:</p>

<p>"Well, dear, what was it like?"</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, it was very amusing, mother. Very different, you know, very
different from&mdash;what we are used to."</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>One late September morning, Mr. Journ&eacute;e awakened with a
twinge of rheumatism in his left shoulder. It was a melancholy day,
with the rain coming down in torrents.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" he thought, "and soon we shall have winter here!
Seven or eight months of it!"</p>

<p>And suddenly his mind reverted to the old desire&mdash;Italy! At
that moment the sun would be gilding the dome of St. Mark's. The
little church of San Miracule, which he had studied so often in
photographs, would be trembling with light against the deep blue
sky. The peasant women in their black shawls would be flocking into
the Baptistery at Florence. The maize fields would be a blaze of
gold. Well, why not? The years of physical enjoyment were numbered.
Anthony was getting on. He had sold two more of his extraordinary
pictures. He was no longer dependent on his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e got up, rubbed his shoulder with ointment,
washed himself, and went down to breakfast. So optimistic did he
suddenly feel that he said to his wife:</p>

<p>"Mother, what do you say? why shouldn't we do that little trip
to Italy?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Journ&eacute;e was never at her best in the early morning.
The servants hadn't been able to get the fire to go, and the bacon
was burnt, the boy had left a white loaf&mdash;Mr. Journ&eacute;e
always had to have brown&mdash;and there was a bill from a
dressmaker. She said:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk such nonsense, Paul."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e made allowances. They had been married for
twenty-seven years, and he had, perhaps, talked too much about this
trip to Italy&mdash;talked and done nothing. There always seemed
some obstacle. And on a morning like this, with the rain pouring
down, and all the petty frictions of domestic life, it seemed as
remote as ever.</p>

<p>In the evening, however, he broached the subject again. It was
feasible. He could afford it. They were not very busy, and Lintot
could manage while he was away. Over her sewing Mrs. Journ&eacute;e
pondered the problem carefully. As a young girl it had been her
wildest dream to go to Italy with Paul. The idea no longer excited
her. She was happy in her home, and travelling frightened her. But
still&mdash;if <i>he</i> wanted to go, why, yes, yes, of course.
There was no longer Anthony to consider. It would doubtless do Paul
good. She said:</p>

<p>"It would be lovely, dear."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e bought a Baedeker, a map, and got together a
collection of travel bureau circulars. He worked the whole thing
out carefully in detail: Paris, Milan, Verona, Venice; then to
Florence, Sienna, Rome, and back to Genoa. They would start at the
end of the month.</p>

<p>During the following weeks Mr. Journ&eacute;e walked about as
though in a dream. He was like a schoolboy with the end of term
approaching. One evening he was sitting in his workshop, after the
men had gone, going into his accounts. There was a sudden knock at
the door, the click of the latch, and Justin came hurrying in. One
glance at his face, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e could see that his
friend was in trouble. He instinctively stood up. Justin came
straight up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Paul, Paul, I'm in for it!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man?"</p>

<p>"My workshops were burnt down last night, and, my God, I'd
forgotten to send the insurance money last week! I'm ruined,
Paul!"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e stood erect, and looked very solemn. He
patted his friend's shoulder. "Good God!" he muttered. "Not
insured, eh?"</p>

<p>He took one or two paces up and down and came back. "What can I
do, old man?"</p>

<p>"Can you lend me two hundred and fifty pounds, Paul? I'll pay
you back one day."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e passed his hand through his hair. After a
brief pause and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>He did not tell his wife about this when he got home. He could
not lend &pound;250 and go to Italy as well. The situation was
grave. Poor old Justin! Another vague hope crept to the back of his
mind. Anthony! It was the boy's father-in-law, and, after all, he
was doing very well now. Perhaps he might help the old man a
little. Why shouldn't he?</p>

<p>After supper Mr. Journ&eacute;e said he was going out for a
stroll. He put on his hat, and took a bus. He found Laura alone
making some mysterious baby garment. He kissed her, and after the
usual formalities, said:</p>

<p>"Where's Anthony?"</p>

<p>Laura bent over her work, and speaking with perfect control,
replied:</p>

<p>"Anthony? Oh, he's gone off to Italy with some friends of
his."</p>

<p><i>Italy!</i>...</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Anthony wrote to Laura from Italy. He described Venice as "a
common little bourgeois swamp, overrun with trippers." Florence
bored him. Rome was on a par with Birmingham. He seemed to spend
most of his time at Milan, studying some new school of painting
that had sprung up there. Though with whom he had gone, and with
whom he was staying, he did not reveal.</p>

<p>He was away four months, and the trip might be described as
Anthony's last phase. Further successes, both financial and social,
had come to him. He became frankly egocentric, a creature living in
abstractions that recognised no moral or social code. Laura never
told him of her father's loss, and when Mr. Journ&eacute;e, trying
to sympathise with her in her position, deplored what he called
"the set" that the boy had drifted into, she turned on him very
fiercely. "After all," she said, "they are his people. They
understand him and like him. It is the world he belongs to."</p>

<p>She hid her grief in the little claims of her home, and the
laughter of her son. And Mr. Journ&eacute;e hid his in his work,
and in the genial satisfaction of setting an old friend on his
feet. He still did his breathing exercises, smoked his pipe, and
walked in the park. The air seemed sweet and good. The little
grandson was an eternal joy&mdash;"People have queer ways of
seeking happiness," he said at random one day to old Justin.</p>

<p>When Anthony eventually returned, the change in him was apparent
and striking. From the shy, self-conscious young man, he had
developed into a cynical poseur. He was superficial, patronising,
and bored. Laura was a middle-aged matron, slopping about the
house. He found his home disgusting&mdash;all baby and cooking. He
met the family in the evening, and talked languidly of his
experiences and successes. The names of countesses and men of
genius were ever on his lips. At the same time he seemed afraid to
be alone with his father. Mr. Journ&eacute;e asked him over to the
shop to have a talk. He promised to go, but never turned up. He
disappeared a few days later. And the mind of Laura registered this
reflection:</p>

<p>"He will never come back. It was wicked of me to have married a
man seven years younger than I."</p>

<p>She went about her work with calm deliberation. Colin was going
to be a splendid boy&mdash;</p>

<p>It was nearly two years, however, before the inevitable
happened. He came occasionally, and would sometimes send her a
spasmodic cheque. And then one day there came a letter, obviously
dictated by a lawyer, and enclosing a receipted hotel bill. She was
glad that no one was present when the letter came. She turned quite
white, and put it in her chatelaine. That evening she called on Mr.
Journ&eacute;e at his shop, and showed him the letter. The old man
put on his spectacles and read it, his hands trembling. And he took
her in his arms and held her close. There seemed nothing to say.
They were just two creatures clinging together in the darkness for
support.</p>

<p>"He wants me to divorce him, so I suppose I must," Laura
reflected, but she did not discuss the matter with her family. She
went to a lawyer and asked for the thing to be done as quietly and
quickly as possible. It took a year, however, for the formalities
to be arranged, and by that time Anthony was something of a
notoriety, the divorce was mentioned in all the daily papers.</p>

<p>The climax filled Mr. Journ&eacute;e with dull anger, like an
outrage on his own personal pride. It seemed in some strange way
incomprehensible, meaningless. He brooded upon it all day. And when
the men had gone in the evening he poured out his troubles to old
Lintot.</p>

<p>"I feel I'm wrong, Lintot. I'm somehow responsible. What have I
done that makes me deserve this. He was a good boy. I educated him.
I did what I thought was the very best always for him. It seemed as
though he couldn't be happy. He hadn't the faculty. I doubt whether
he's happy now. Whether he ever could be&mdash;that's the great
trouble."</p>

<p>Old Lintot regarded his master thoughtfully. A dank cigarette
hung from the corner of his heavily bearded mouth. He twisted it
and wriggled it from one side to the other. At last he put on his
hat and shuffled towards the door. With his hand on the latch, he
turned and said in a melancholy voice:</p>

<p>"A man who doesn't believe in things, guv'nor, never finds
happiness."</p>

<p>He added: "Good-night!" rather jerkily, as though afraid to
trust his voice.</p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Believe in things! Was the old man right? Was that perhaps just
the trouble? You can educate the mind, but you cannot educate the
heart. You can believe in things yourself, but can you teach others
to do so? The boy had been bored with Italy! Italy? no, he knew
that he would never go there now. The time had passed. But he could
still walk with Leonardo through the squares of Florence. He could
gaze reverently at the Duomo, and listen to the chanting of
priests. He could be at one with all the masters of the past,
because, without knowing, he desired so much to contribute in his
humble way to their tradition. And at night he could creep through
the olive groves, and gaze up at the stars, and feel the majesty of
life pour through him. Across the valley he could hear the silver
tinkle of a bell in some remote campanile. And he could be happy,
because he loved it all, the beauty of the world, and the great
soul that moved behind its mysterious purposes.</p>

<p>He thought that he would never see his son again, but he did
just once. It was five years later, and he came to borrow money. He
had married a French woman, and was living at Mentone. The Vortex
School was a little out of date. He had been gambling, and got into
the hands of money-lenders. His rich friends seemed to have
deserted him. In a state of despair he had come to London, and
sought out his father. He called at the workshop, quite casually
one evening, as though it were the most ordinary thing in the world
to call and borrow &pound;500. His face was lined, haggard, and
furtive. Mr. Journ&eacute;e had often visualised the coming of his
son. He had rehearsed in his mind the things he meant to say. He
had not forgotten Laura's dictum: "After all, they are his people.
They understand him, and like him. It is the world he belongs to."
He had meant to be magnanimous, forgiving. We can none of us quite
help being what we are, perhaps.</p>

<p>But with his son before him, he could think of none of the
things he wished to say. There arose between them again that solid
wall of unfamiliar experience. He felt that anything he said the
young man would either not understand, or consider banal and
worthless. His clever sophisticated face rebelled any approach to
emotional comprehension. He talked glibly of certain vague
securities, and spoke of the loan as of a quite temporary
arrangement. Mr. Journ&eacute;e lent him &pound;100. He could not
afford more. He had been keeping Laura for years, and there was the
grandson's future to consider. He did not resent this. The
responsibility enlarged his horizon. He accepted Anthony's worth at
Laura's valuation. But he would not give him more than a
hundred.</p>

<p>Just as he was going he noticed a strange expression on his
son's face. He looked around the workshop, at the carved panels and
friezes, the charcoal drawings, and the workmen's tools. He seemed
to sniff the wood, and suddenly gave his father a keen hungry
glance. And in that glance the father became aware of a salient
fact. <i>The boy was envious of him!</i> Not only that, but
somewhere deep down in him he loved his father. He had drugged the
passion, but it was there.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e wanted to say: "Anthony, my boy, speak to me.
Tell me all about yourself. What are you really thinking? What are
you really feeling? Speak to me! Speak to me!"</p>

<p>But he merely blotted and handed him the cheque. The young man
took it and put it in his pocket-book, with a hang-dog air. He
said:</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, father," and shuffled towards the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e watched him go. He heard the latch click, and
the door shut. Then he heard the footsteps clattering down the
iron-clamped stairs. When the footsteps had nearly reached the
bottom, he suddenly raised his head and cried hoarsely: "Anthony!
come back!...Come back!"</p>

<p>But he heard the front door shut, and the footsteps die away
across the yard. And the old man buried his face in his hands.</p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Colin was ten years old. He went to school. On Sundays he always
accompanied his two grandfathers on their weekly walk in Regent's
Park. He had accepted the familiar explanation about his father
having "gone on a long journey" with complete acquiescence. He
seldom asked about him now. Laura also found that she could talk
about her husband dispassionately. She rather liked to talk about
him to Mr. Journ&eacute;e. She could see that the old man was still
troubled, and it somehow helped him to hear her talk about his son.
She called him "Father Paul." Once when he was deploring the boy's
behaviour, she said:</p>

<p>"I can't altogether blame him, Father Paul. We are all made
differently. It's a curious thing that on those few occasions when
he took me out to visit those friends of his, I liked him better
than at any other time. He was quite natural there, and, somehow,
so charming and entertaining. I could not mix with his friends, and
he knew it. It was unfortunate that he&mdash;well, that he married
me, more than anything else. He loved me in a way. I fitted in with
a certain mood. He needed me. But love with him was not a personal
thing so much as a condition. He slipped out of that mood and he
didn't need me. The trouble with him was that&mdash;unlike
you&mdash;he had no faculty for happiness."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e regarded her thoughtfully. Happiness! that
was just what old Lintot had said. Something like that&mdash;about
believing in things. He said: "You're a brave girl, Laura."</p>

<p>One October, Mrs. Journ&eacute;e got her feet wet marketing. The
next day she developed a chill, which lasted for some days. It was
practically cured, when, probably through cleaning out a cupboard
in a draughty loft, it recurred with renewed violence. The
following night she developed pneumonia, and a doctor was sent for.
For days she lay in a critical condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e's distress was pitiful to watch. He would
sometimes dart over to his workshop, but in half an hour he would
be back. He wandered about the house helplessly, picking things up
and putting them down again. He would go into his wife's bedroom,
clutch her hand, and murmur:</p>

<p>"Well, mother?"</p>

<p>He would look at the medicine bottles, and finger them
nervously, as though appealing to them, or accusing them of
inertia. Then he would wander about the room on tiptoe, making
curious little noises of distress like a wounded animal.</p>

<p>Laura&mdash;who at that time had given up her house, and was
living with her parents again&mdash;came in and took up her abode.
She relieved the night nurse, who had been called in. On the second
day the doctor said to her:</p>

<p>"The situation is very grave."</p>

<p>At dinner-time that day Mr. McGrath called to make inquiries. As
he was leaving he said to Laura:</p>

<p>"I see in the paper, my dear, that Anthony is in London. Look!
he is staying with&mdash;with his wife at this address."</p>

<p>Laura mechanically looked at the paper. After her father had
gone this information that Anthony was in London kept interrupting
her thoughts. Anthony no longer meant anything to her that
mattered. But this was his mother. It was of Mr. Journ&eacute;e
that she kept thinking. There was Anthony within a cab ride of his
dying mother. There was Mr. Journ&eacute;e blindly groping for
comfort and sympathy from all the world...</p>

<p>When evening came she had arrived at a decision. The night nurse
relieved her at eight o'clock. She would put her pride in her
pocket and go to him. When she was leaving she looked in on Mr.
Journ&eacute;e who was standing in front of a neglected fire in the
dining-room. She kissed him and said:</p>

<p>"I may come back later, Father Paul."</p>

<p>He kissed her lightly, and answered in a preoccupied manner:</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear, you look so tired and pale. Go to bed! Go to
bed! It will be all right."</p>

<p>She pressed his arm and said confidently: "You must still
believe, Father Paul. We expect you to believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>She went away hurriedly, and after a search she found a cab, and
told the driver to go to a certain address on Chelsea Embankment.
The evening was cold and foggy. The cab crept round corners, and
was continually being blocked in the traffic. The journey seemed
interminable. She set her teeth and clutched the window strap.</p>

<p>At last they pulled up at a little white house. She paid the
driver, and he began to abuse her because she only gave him a
threepenny tip. She blushed confusedly. She was so unaccustomed to
taking cabs that she did not know. She wanted to say: "Please,
please, not to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hurriedly gave him another shilling, and went up to the door
and rang the bell. After a time the door was opened by a
solemn-looking butler. She asked for Mr. Anthony Journ&eacute;e.
The man had a strange scared expression on his face.</p>

<p>He seemed uncertain how to act. He let her in and left her
standing in the hall without a word. The house seemed to smell of
some curious odour she could not recognize. In a room on the right
she heard a woman behaving hysterically. She was left alone for two
or three minutes, and then two burly-looking men came out to her.
They ushered her into another room, and looked at her searchingly.
The elder said:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me who you are, madam?"</p>

<p>She answered quickly: "Does it matter? I have come from Mr.
Journ&eacute;e's father. His mother is seriously ill."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, and the same speaker replied
quietly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Anthony Journ&eacute;e is dead! He was murdered this
afternoon by a woman!"</p>

<p>Laura was conscious of some strong underlying power forcing her
to a surprising degree of control. She thought instinctively of her
son, and then of old Mr. Journ&eacute;e pacing that lonely room in
front of the neglected fire. There were others to fight for. She
must not think of herself.</p>

<p>As he spoke the man handed her a card, and she just glimpsed the
fact that he was a police inspector. She felt terribly undecided
how to act&mdash;what to ask. She heard the voices of a man and
woman almost screaming at each other in the hall. The door opened
abruptly. The man and woman entered. The man was a foreigner of
some sort, with a sallow skin, and a black moustache. The woman was
also obviously a foreigner, with a dead white skin, and unnaturally
glittering eyes, which she was mopping with a handkerchief. She was
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I don't believe it! I don't believe it! I was at Amalfi all the
time. He never met her there&mdash;"</p>

<p>She caught sight of Laura, and ejaculated: "Oh, mon Dieu!"</p>

<p>The man was saying:</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mimi. Why do you bully me? It is only the
Contesse's word&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two police inspectors stood up. Suddenly the woman looked at
Laura again, a new light coming into her eyes. She screamed
out:</p>

<p>"Oh, how funny! Do you know who this is? This is his
wife&mdash;his first wife!"</p>

<p>She went off into hysterical laughter, and snapped her fingers
in Laura's face. The scent from the handkerchief mingled with that
other more penetrating smell. The man, the woman, and the police
inspectors all seemed to be talking at the same time. She heard
unfamiliar names flung about, threats, menaces. Out of the
confusion she sensed some sordid episode, which is generously
spoken of as the <i>crime passionelle</i>. The whole thing seemed
terribly unreal. It was as though she had stepped from moving
reality straight into a film.</p>

<p>She turned to the police inspector as to the one stable thing in
a reeling world, and said quite calmly:</p>

<p>"I presume I may go?"</p>

<p>Her placidity appeared to anger the Frenchwoman. She spat at
her, abused her, and called her names. The two inspectors
intervened, and ushered her quickly from the room.</p>

<p>When out in the air she nearly fainted. She rested for a time on
an embankment seat, and watched the river.</p>

<p>"So that was the end of it," she thought. "My poor Anthony!"</p>

<p>She choked back a little sob, the only personal indulgence she
had allowed herself that night, and hailed a cab.</p>

<p>She found Mr. Journ&eacute;e up, and when she saw him she knew
that he had good news. He clutched her hands, and said eagerly:</p>

<p>"Laura, Laura girl, the doctor says he thinks the crisis is
past. She will get better, please God!"</p>

<p>She stayed with him an hour, watching him gradually calm
down.</p>

<p>"Poor Father Paul!" she thought, "your anguish for the night is
not yet over."</p>

<p>It would be in all the papers in the morning. Even if he did not
see it, someone would tell him. It were better that she told him
herself.</p>

<p>When he seemed quite calm, she said softly:</p>

<p>"Father Paul, I have bad news for you."</p>

<p>She got up and turned the light very low. She somehow felt that
it was easier to say what she had to in the dark. Going close up to
him and resting her face on his shoulder, she said:</p>

<p>"Anthony is dead!"</p>

<p>And then she wept tempestuously. She made no attempt to restrain
her tears. She wanted him to feel that she relied on him. That the
pity for himself would be submerged in that greater pity of which
he had so inexhaustible a store.</p>

<p>When she had spent herself she lay inertly against him ready to
succour him in any way he needed. They remained silent for a long
while. At last he sighed and murmured:</p>

<p>"That fellow was right, you know, Laura, that fellow was
right."</p>

<p>"What fellow, Father Paul?"</p>

<p>"That fellow who said, 'Each man kills the thing he loves.'
Come, my dear, kiss me good-night."</p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>It was Colin's twelfth birthday, and five other children were
invited to the birthday party. There was a great to-do. The
tea-table was laden with cakes and bonbons. In the centre was a
large cake covered with pink icing on which was modelled in white,
"C. J., 12 years."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e had come home very early. He was in a great
state of excitement, running from one room to another, calling
out:</p>

<p>"Now then, mother, anything I can do, my dear? Where are those
candles? Colin, Colin! God bless my soul! I don't believe the boy
has washed his face yet! Scaramouche! Come along, hurry up! They'll
all be here soon. What did I do with that parcel I brought in?
Laura, Laura! Have you seen a large brown-paper parcel?"</p>

<p>The children arrived, all a little shy of each other. They
glanced furtively at the cakes, and then at each other. The tea
began in almost sepulchral silence, so far as they were concerned.
Only Mr. Journ&eacute;e kept up a running fire of badinage. A
bonbon popped. A small girl began to giggle. One boy pushed another
off a chair (roars of laughter)! In a few minutes the fun was fast
and furious. The tea finished in a din, all the children wearing
paper caps. A move was made into the other room, and games began.
Coloured air-balloons were banged hither and thither, to the
detriment of sundry vases and pieces of furniture. They played
musical chairs and postman's knock, and a curious game invented by
Mr. Journ&eacute;e called "Squidge," in which everyone had to
imitate an animal of some sort.</p>

<p>Old Lintot came in later. He had a niece there, and he stood on
the fringe of the party smiling amusedly. Laura brought him some
tea, and talked to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said: "Look at Father Paul! Isn't he
wonderful?"</p>

<p>He was at that particular moment being an elephant, and two
small boys were riding on his back. His eyes were bright, and he
was totally immersed in the game. A few minutes later he was a lion
roaring under the piano. Old Lintot said:</p>

<p>"I've known him thirty-five years, Mrs. Laura."</p>

<p>He meditatively bit a piece of seed cake, and added:</p>

<p>"He's a genius, Mrs. Laura. If you know what I mean, he has the
greatest genius of all, the genius for happiness. He's not afraid
of letting himself feel things, even if they make him suffer. He is
always seeing, you know, what the old poet spoke of 'sermons in
stones, books in the running brooks, good in everything.' It's the
one thing really worth while. It's when a man loses the child in
himself that he goes wrong."</p>

<p>The old man flicked some crumbs from his beard, muttering:
"Excuse me!" Then he looked at Laura, as though doubting whether he
hadn't been a little tactless. He put down his teacup, and
said:</p>

<p>"Of course, it's no good blaming anyone. We are all fearfully
and wonderfully made,&mdash;a fine boy that of yours."</p>

<p>Laura suddenly plucked him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Come into the other room a moment, Mr. Lintot," she
whispered.</p>

<p>When they arrived there, she said:</p>

<p>"You have been such an old friend of&mdash;of everyone's, Mr.
Lintot. Did Father Paul ever tell you the little incident about
poor Anthony's will?"</p>

<p>"No, no. He did not."</p>

<p>"He left a will on half a sheet of notepaper. It was made many,
many years ago, when he was at the height of his success. He left
it with a lawyer. It simply said: 'I leave everything I may possess
when I die to my son Colin. May he be more like my father than like
me.' The lawyer told me he brought it to him one evening when he
was very drunk. He made him put it away in a safe, and promise to
act on it when he died."</p>

<p>Old Lintot nodded. He murmured:</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes, yes, I understand. Truth in the cup! It's very strange
how this 'leperous distilment' will sometimes make a man see truth
when all else fails. And has the lawyer acted on it?"</p>

<p>Laura shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! his only legacy was debts and debts and debts. But,
oh! that little gesture flung out on a drunken night..."</p>

<p>"It made your father happy, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"Yes, father always believed in him, you see."</p>

<p>The old man took her arm, leading her back to the party. His
voice was almost inaudible as he repeated:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we're fearfully and wonderfully made. It's no good
blaming anyone&mdash;thank you for your confidence, Mrs.
Laura."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. The Funeral March</h2>

<p>She was a woman with a genius for apparent helplessness. She
drifted around the verandah of the Hotel Reina Christa like an
autumn leaf, and like an autumn leaf she was for ever changing her
hue. She was always wearing different-coloured cloaks and shawls,
which other people had to fetch for her. Not only men, but women.
She was so helpless, you see. To me she was like a white flower,
which one is only conscious of at night. One associated her with
the night&mdash;the dead white face with the little flick of
carmine on the lips, the blue-black hair, and those large, dark
appealing eyes. She was always appealing, appealing for sympathy
and understanding&mdash;and anything else. She seemed to give out
nothing of herself. She was nebulous. But in my whole life? have
never met anyone such a complete mistress of the verb
<i>schwrmen</i>. It is a pity there is no real translation for
this word, for she embodied it in her every phrase and movement.
The women, who were for the most part middle-aged English and
American women, staying there for health or pleasure, entirely
succumbed to her. They found her most fascinating. She certainly
could be amusing at times, and she had travelled a lot, and seen
sides of life that appeared entirely romantic and remote to most of
them. Moreover, she was Russian, which means so much when you are
susceptible to mystic influences.</p>

<p>The men, I noticed, were a little afraid of her, but as they
were men whose activities centred principally around golf and
bridge it is not surprising. They did not like being asked about
their souls, and when their physical beauty was praised openly
before a crowd of people they felt self-conscious. But some of them
seemed t? like to sit and talk with her&mdash;alone. There was one
young sub&mdash;just out of the shell, with some of the yolk still
on his hair&mdash;who became apparently wildly infatuated. He
devoted not only his evenings, but many of the precious hours when
he might have been playing golf to her. The frenzy lasted for ten
days, and suddenly the pale youth disappeared. Poor Madame
Vieninoff wandered the grounds disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor dear Geoffrey," she said to everyone. "What has
happened to him? He was so sweet!&mdash;so sweet!"</p>

<p>She was discovered the same evening probing under the lilies on
the pond beyond the pergola with a walking-stick. I think it was a
disappointment to her not to discover that pale face floating
amongst them. She was <i>so</i> helpless.</p>

<p>It must have been an even greater disappointment when it
transpired that the young man had just remembered that he 'vas down
to play in a golf tournament in a town fifteen miles away, and he
had not had time to let her know. She soon, however, recovered from
this. To that frumpy old Mrs. Wyatt she would exclaim: "Oh, my
darling, how <i>beautiful</i> you look to-night! You must always
wear cerise and black. What exquisite pearls! They are like your
eyes, floating in the ether."</p>

<p>To little Mrs. Champneys she would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, come and talk to me. I am <i>so</i> lonely. You
are <i>so sympathique</i>."</p>

<p>And she would tell Mrs. Champneys all about her dear beloved
husband, who she said had been a great musician, and had died many
years ago. She would sap this poor little woman's nervous vitality
with her moving stories of love, and death, and passion, with her
tales of suffering, interlarded with little flicks of cynical
humour. She could blow hot and cold too. She was heard one evening
screaming at her maid in French, on account of some trivial
ill-adjustment of her frock. She sulked for an afternoon because a
pretty woman named Viola Winch had occupied the whole of old
Colonel Gouchard's time during <i>djeuner</i>.</p>

<p>But for the most part she had it all her own way. There was
little opposition. She was never so happy as when surrounded by
some dozen of the hotel habitus listening to her stories, or
absorbing her charm.</p>

<p>It was during one of these occasions that I noticed strange
little occurrence. The evening train used to come in while the
guests were at dinner, consequently the new arrivals usually dined
alone, and either did or did not join the others afterwards.</p>

<p>I was seated in a chair on the verandah facing the dining-room
obliquely. Madame Vieninoff was the centre of an admiring group as
usual. I had never heard her so entertaining. The French door to
the dining-room was open, and I observed an elderly
distinguished-looking man with white hair and a pointed
beard&mdash;one of the late-comers&mdash;dining alone. He was
obviously tired from a long journey and in need of his dinner,
which he enjoyed with the quiet satisfaction of a gourmet. He was
nearing the end, and had raised a glass of wine to his lips, when?
suddenly observed him stop, as though listening. He put the glass
down, and frowned perplexedly, as though trying to associate what
he was listening to with some past experience.</p>

<p>Then he finished his wine and pondered. After a few more minutes
he stood up and came to the open door, where I was sitting, and
looked out on to the verandah at the group of people. I saw his eye
alight on Madame Vieninoff, and a curious cynical smile twisted his
lips. He returned to finish his dinner. I could not see in the dim
light whether she had observed him, but I noticed as he went back
she was laughing rather hysterically at some reminiscence that she
had herself been recounting. Then she became curiously subdued.</p>

<p>When the elderly gentleman came out to partake of his coffee and
cognac, Madame Vieninoff had retired. She said the night was
oppressive, and was affecting her nerves. I thought to myself: "Ho,
ho!" which is another way of saying that we all love a mystery.</p>

<p>I made a point of engaging the newcomer in conversation,
although, of course, it was impossible at the moment to talk about
Madame Vieninoff. We talked about hotels, and the country, and
sport, and other safe subjects which hotel guests interminably
discuss. He was a quiet, cultivated Frenchman, prepared to be
friendly, but not too communicative&mdash;not a man to be rushed or
cross-examined. We retired early.</p>

<p>The next two days wrought an extraordinary change in Madame
Vieninoff. There was no disguising it. She still drifted about the
verandah, but it was in a furtive uncertain manner. She appeared
petulant and no one could get a smile out of her. She was
obviously, moreover, in dread of finding herself in the presence of
this new arrival. She kept her room for hours, and sent her maid
for time-tables, or to make enquiries at the bureau about the
departure of trains to here, there, and everywhere, which was
surprising, as she had told everyone that she meant to winter at
the Reina Christa. The poor woman was in great distress, and it
became apparent to my friend, whose name I discovered to be Louis
Denoyel. Everyone observed that Madame Vieninoff was not herself,
but I doubt whether anyone else, except myself, associated her
agitation with the arrival of Monsieur Denoyel. On the third
afternoon she carne on to the verandah, where I was drinking coffee
with Denoyel. She glanced at us and darted away.</p>

<p>Denoyel frowned, and the cynical smile left his face. He stroked
his beard, shrugged his shoulders, and muttered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's too bad! After all, she's a woman!"</p>

<p>He looked up at me quizzically, and I said:</p>

<p>"All of which I find intriguing."</p>

<p>He thought for a long while. Then he took out a visiting-card,
wrote something on it, and rang the bell for the waiter. When the
waiter came he said:</p>

<p>"Bring me an envelope, please, and I would like you to take this
message to Madame Vieninoff."</p>

<p>The waiter was away for nearly five minutes, and I sat there
anxiously hoping that my friend would show me what was written on
the card. He was amused at my curiosity, and in a sudden whim he
handed it across to me without a word. On it was written in
French:</p>

<p class="letter">"Do not be alarmed. I am leaving to-morrow
morning.&mdash;L. D."</p>

<p>When the waiter had taken the message, I said:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you cannot leave it at that."</p>

<p>He lightly beat a tattoo on the table with his left hand, and
then he said:</p>

<p>"No, I suppose, having gone so far, I must tell you the whole
thing. But wait till this evening, and we will go out for a stroll
along the bay."</p>

<p>The night was warm and fine, and seated on the carcass of a
fallen pine tree at the edge of the dunes, just above the bay,
Monsieur Denoyel told me this story:</p>

<p><br>
"It's a strange story," he said, "because it is a series of
contradictions. But all true stories manage somehow or other to
contradict themselves; life is like that, I suppose.</p>

<p>"In the days when the ill-fated Romanoffs flourished and
Imperial Russia was a force to be reckoned with, Serge Vieninoff
was a musician of some repute in Petersburg. He was inclined to be
lazy and had accomplished nothing very distinguished, but people
were beginning to talk of his future. He had a considerable private
fortune, and kept up a certain amount of style in the most
fashionable quarter of the city. He was popular, amiable, and
cultured. And then one day he met and fell in love with Wanda
Karrienski. She was the daughter of a small innkeeper, and was at
that time serving as a manicurist in one of the big stores. That is
our friend across the way."</p>

<p>And Monsieur Denoyel nodded in the direction of the Reina
Christa, whose lights were reflected upon the still surface of the
bay.</p>

<p>"She was of the clinging, helpless, passionate kind, exuding an
atmosphere of ingenuousness; but, as you yourself may easily
divine, not quite so ingenuous, indeed, not quite so helpless as
she appears. She made every kind of apparent protest against
marrying the aristocratic Serge. She was of a different class,
unworthy, too unsophisticated, and all that kind of thing. Oh, she
did the thing well. It was just the kind of attitude which
infatuated the musician. He would have none of it, and he married
her.</p>

<p>"Now you can imagine, coming from the hard conditions in which
she had been brought up, and the struggle and indignity of her
calling&mdash;for you must realize that a female manicurist in
Petersburg in those days did not hold the same kind of position as
a manicurist holds in London or New York. Her work was mostly
connected with young officers. Suddenly finding herself the
mistress of a large and fashionable household, and the legitimate
wife of a distinguished and wealthy man&mdash;well, what could you
expect?</p>

<p>"It was the kind of thing she had dreamed of, and read about in
cheap novels, but never considered realizable. And suddenly the
dream came true. She adapted herself to these conditions like a
duck to water. As you may observe, she is still by no means
unlovely, and in those days she was an extremely pretty woman.
Moreover, she had a certain native wit, and that most invaluable
asset to any woman&mdash;the genius of knowing exactly how to
dress. In spite of her lowly birth, Vieninoff's friends quickly
absorbed her. She became popular and sought after. Her life became
one round of dissipation, balls, theatres, dinners, sleigh rides,
receptions, and all the gay things which a woman of her nature
craves for. Vieninoff couldn't live up to it. He was a dreamer,
absorbed in his work; and for the most part he let her go her own
way, although devoted to her.</p>

<p>"There were two years of this, and then suddenly&mdash;biff!
War, revolution, fall of the monarchy, counterrevolution, defeat,
ruin! The whole edifice fell to the ground, and among the dbris
wandered the disconsolate figures of Vieninoff and his wife. He was
ruined. The house and furniture were seized by the Bolshevik
government, his property was confiscated. Scraping together
whatever they could out of the shambles, they managed eventually to
reach Paris with a few thousand francs between them and actual
starvation.</p>

<p>"They rented two rooms in a meagre little street just off the
Rue des Ecoles. It was a wretched place, insufferably hot in the
summer, perishingly cold in the winter. But Mr. Vieninoff was a man
of spirit. He got together the few treasures they had saved out of
the wreck, and spent a portion of his small capital in hiring an
upright piano. 'I will teach,' he said. 'I will write and make
money. I will rise like a Phoenix. Courage, my little cabbage!'</p>

<p>"To Wanda it was&mdash;just hell! For a time she appeared dazed
by the whole thing. She had been genuinely frightened, and
experienced a certain sense of relief in escaping with her life.
But when she began to settle down and realize the situation, the
reaction was violent. She found herself cooped up in these two
wretched rooms with a man who did nothing but tinkle on a piano, or
scribble on sheets of paper. She wandered the streets and found a
city larger and gayer than Petersburg. She saw magnificent shops,
motorcars, restaurants, theatres, cabarets, and dancing-halls. She
saw gay parties of people on their way to these places, and the
sight made her eat her heart out. She did not believe in her
husband or his ridiculous music. She felt she had been deceived and
wronged. She turned against him, and vent all her pent-up spleen
upon the unfortunate musician. 'I married an old fool,' she would
tell him. 'Oh, my God! all my brilliance thrown away on a
nincompoop who thinks he's a genius! Oh, fool that I am.'</p>

<p>"Vieninoff struggled on. He managed to get a few pupils, sons
and daughters of tradespeople, who paid badly and were very stupid.
They came and went, came and went. He just managed to pay the rent,
and buy the barest necessities of life for them both. When not
teaching he spent his whole time trying to compose, and for this
reason he was happier than his wife. She did nothing but sit about,
nag her husband, and urge him t? get work that brought in more
money.</p>

<p>"He was always optimistic. He believed that better times would
come, that he would be appreciated, but nothing happened. The years
went by, and their position became only worse. And then Mr.
Vieninoff began to cough. And he coughed, and coughed, and
something told him that the end was not far off, and the knowledge
brought with it an element of relief. For as he coughed so did
Wanda become more intolerant and abusive. It was bad enough to have
a poor husband, but a sick one was even worse.</p>

<p>"She began to prepare for her husband's death. When he died she
would sell that wretched piano, and the few sticks of furniture,
burn his musical manuscripts, and try to get back to her beloved
Russia. Or perhaps she would marry again, a rich man this time and
a brilliant one. Perhaps she would stop in Paris. There were many
rich men in Paris&mdash;Americans, English, Italian. What did it
matter? She had not yet lost her looks. She became quite eager for
her husband's death. She even did not hesitate to discuss it with
him, to jibe at him, and asked him what provision he had made when
he deserted her!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel threw the stump of his cigar far away across
the sand with an angry gesture. It whipped the night air like a
firefly, and settled behind some scrub. Then leaning forward on his
stick he continued:</p>

<p>"Vieninoff had been very good to his wife. In the early days he
had loved her passionately. When eyerything went wrong he had stuck
to her. In their material distress he had thought more of her than
of himself. When they were practically starving it was never she
who went without. But lying on his bed towards the end of his days
he suddenly realized with vivid intensity the kind of woman she
was. A slow anger and resentment began to burn within him. In fair
weather she had been all smiles and charm, in foul she proved
herself utterly callous and heartless. He felt a desire to punish
her in some way. But what could he do? It was perhaps bad enough to
leave her nearly penniless. That alone would have been intolerable
if she had loved him and been good to him. But he knew that when he
died she would not be penniless for long. She was not that kind of
woman. She would dance upon his grave. She would forget him, or
cherish his memory as an ugly nightmare. Lying there in the
darkness he went over and over again the tragic horror of the
situation. It stirred him at strange angles. It even aroused the
musician in him. Sombre musical phrases pounded through his brain.
<i>He would write his own funeral march!</i> Moreover, it should be
played at his own funeral at all costs. It seemed the only thing
left to him&mdash;a dignified gesture with which to leave the
world. The thought almost made him chuckle with anticipation and
glee.</p>

<p>"When she asked him the next day what he was doing, he replied:
'I'm writing my masterpiece.' She sneered at him and went out. Mr.
Vieninoff was very busy for weeks after that. He never left his
room. And then one day he pulled himself together, and putting on
an old hat on which the dust was very thick, he crawled out and
visited a notary in an adjoining street. 'I want to make my will,'
he said. He gave a careful detailed list of all his belongings, and
explained that on his death these were to be immediately sold and
the money set aside to defray the expenses of a band employed to
accompany him to the graye. And the band was to play his own
funeral march.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the notary. 'And what about your wife?'</p>

<p>"'I leave her the residue of the estate,' he said, with a low
chuckle.</p>

<p>"'And what does that amount to?'</p>

<p>"Mr. Vieninoff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' he replied, 'there are my manuscripts.'</p>

<p>"The notary probably thought he was a lunatic. But there it is.
The law's the law. The will was duly drawn up and signed. Haying
accomplished this feat Mr. Vieninoff's grip on life appeared to
cease. He died quietly one evening a few weeks later. He was quite
alone when the end came, his wife being out at a cabaret with a
woman friend."</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel lighted another cigar. The windows of some of
the upper rooms at the Reina Christa were beginning to add their
reflections to the pattern on the bay, suggesting that the early
people were already retiring. The deep melodious cry of a brown owl
reached us from a long way off across the dunes. My informant
coughed, and appeared a little uncertain how to complete the
picture he was conjuring up. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Paris is essentially a city of the unexpected. One should never
be surprised at anything one sees or hears there. But Mr.
Vieninoff's funeral was surely one of the most surprising
spectacles that ever appeared in that surprising city. Madame
Vieninoff had heard nothing about the will, and, as you may
imagine, when the notary appeared and read the terms of it to her
she was furious. Vieninoff had left her nothing but the
premeditated bonfire of his manuscripts. Madame Myrthil, the
landlady of the establishment, declared that in a moment of
hysterical rage Madame Vieninoff had actually struck her dead
husband with a roll of music. But let us prefer to believe that
this was an exaggeration. In any case, she found herself in a
helpless position. Monsieur Pitau, the notary, was a dry old stick,
but he was very efficient, and he performed his duties with
meticulous care. His trouble was being so pressed for time. It
appeared that Mr. Vieninoff had bought the piano on the
hire-purchase system, and it was now his property. This, of course,
made a considerable difference, and when everything was sold he
found that the estate realized several thousand francs. And this
money he had to spend on a band!</p>

<p>"A band! Monsieur Pitau knew nothing about bands. How to hire a
band? So the day before the funeral he went to a friend who
conducted an orchestra in a caf in the Bouleyard Poissinnire.
This gentleman was a violinist conducting an orchestra of four. But
that wasn't sufficient. Monsieur Pitau wanted a <i>band</i>, a
large band to play a funeral march in the streets. He was prepared
to spend several thousand francs. The violinist said, 'Good,' leave
it to him. The next morning there assembled in a little yard off
the Rue des Ecoles the strangest band you can possibly imagine.
There were the four musicians from the caf wearing a curious green
semi-military fustian which was their accustomed uniform. There
were seyen or eight students from the Conservatoire with piccolos,
clarionets, flutes, and saxophones. There were two drummers from an
infantry regiment, and several other odd people who had surely
newer had a musical instrument in their hands before. The parts
were handed round, and of course there was no time for a
rehearsal.</p>

<p>"When the hearse arrived, the conductor drew his strange company
up into some kind of order. The perfectly plain corn was covered
with a black pall on which reposed one wreath of immortelles. There
were no mourners, although Madame Vieninoff followed the band, as
though wildly hoping that even yet something might be extracted
from this exhibition of lunacy.</p>

<p>"The cavalcade started, and the band struck up. Now the
conductor, who played the violin, was some kind of a musician, and
he made a serious attempt to interpret the themes of the dead
composer. But the same cannot be said of the others. They began
solemnly marching down the Boulevard St. Michel. A crowd quickly
began to collect. And everyone was saying: 'Whose funeral is this?
What is this band? What are they playing?' No one could give an
answer. By the time they had crossed the river and reached the
Grands Boulevards thousands were following, and the band had got
quite out of hand. They had entirely lost all sense of a
composition. There never was heard such a raging cacophony, such a
screaming riot of discord. Long before they reached Montmartre the
students were ragging the whole thing. The saxophone was wailing
little bits of jazz, the flute interlarding passages from vulgar
popular songs. The people were roaring with laughter, refusing to
believe that it was a real funeral at all. It was only the
conductor and the two military drummers who lent to the performance
any sense of rhythm at all. So great was the congestion that before
Montmartre Cemetery was reached a large body of police was
telephoned for to keep the people in order. There was very nearly a
riot. And in any case, it led to an inquiry, which cost the country
thousands of francs. And thus it was that poor Mr. Vieninoff went
to his last resting-place, and Madame Vieninoff received her
punishment."</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel stood up.</p>

<p>"Let us stroll back," he said, "and I will tell you perhaps the
strangest part of the story on the way. The affair, as you may
imagine, got into the newspapers. It made what the papers calla
'story,' a good 'story' too. It occupied a prominent place on the
front page of not only all the French newspapers, but of the
English and American. There was something which captured the
imagination in an unknown composer writing his own funeral march,
and going to his grave to the strains of it.</p>

<p>"While the public interest was still hot on it, an astute
publisher had the wit to publish the composition with the 'story'
printed on the cover. And then, of course, the most surprising
thing of all happened. Someone quite by chance showed a copy to
Monsieur Taillandier, the conductor of the Philharmonic orchestra.
That gentleman glanced through it idly, and then his interest
became aroused. He took it home and studied it. And suddenly he
exclaimed to his wife: 'But this is a most interesting and original
composition!'</p>

<p>"You have already no doubt anticipated what was to follow.
Monsieur Taillandier sought information about this composer and his
work, and he was referred to Monsieur Pitau, who passed him on to
the widow. One afternoon, he called on Madame Vieninoff. He found
her surveying an enormous mass of music manuscripts piled up on the
stove. There were tears of anger in her eye, and a box of matches
in her hand.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing, madame?' he inquired.</p>

<p>"'I'm trying to destroy the relics of a wasted life,' she blazed
at him. 'And the filthy stuff won't burn. It's too thick.'</p>

<p>"Monsieur Taillandier snatched a bundle from the heated stove.
The edges of the music were charred. It was his turn to be
angry.</p>

<p>"'Imbecile!' he screamed at her.</p>

<p>"She did not, of course, know who he was, and she became even
angrier. They had a bad quarter of an hour, till at last he was
able to persuade her that the music might not only be good, but it
might have some commercial value. This altered the whole case. She
allowed him to come later with a secretary and sort the music out.
A musical agent was called in to deal with it. Monsieur Taillandier
proved himself a sound judge, but he never for a moment anticipated
the surprising results of his discovery. A lot of the work was
immature, particularly that done during his days of prosperity in
Petersburg. But all his later work was surprisingly brilliant. He
had written innumerable concertos, symphonies, and sonatas, to say
nothing of songs and piano solos. All these were published and
performed, and a Vieninoff composition became quite a vogue. But
the most profitable discovery for Madame Vieninoff was that of two
light operas. One, called 'Licette'&mdash;which he must have
written when he was starving&mdash;you have probably heard, or
heard of. It has been running simultaneously in Boston, Paris, and
Vienna for nearly a year. The other is shortly to be produced."</p>

<p>"You mean to say," I ventured, "that Madame Vieninoff is a
comparatively rich woman, all through her husband's despised
compositions?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel shrugged his shoulders. "She winters here at
the Reina Christa. She has her own maid. I have met her during the
season at Cannes, and Pau, and Seville. She has not yet found it
necessary to&mdash;marry her rich man."</p>

<p>We were approaching the wrought-iron entrance gate to the
hotel.</p>

<p>"There is one mystery I cannot yet understand, monsieur," I
said. "How is it that you know all the details of this affair?"</p>

<p>He pressed my arm confidentially.</p>

<p>"I was the doctor, monsieur, who attended Vieninoff till the
last. He told me all on his death-bed. I had the honour of being
the only person to send him a final tribute&mdash;a wreath of
immortelles. I am the only one who knows the whole truth. It is
perhaps for this reason that Madame Vieninoff is&mdash;well, shall
I say a little shy in my presence?"</p>

<p>We walked up the drive, and lo! there on the verandah in her
favourite seat was Madame Vieninoff, surrounded by her satellites.
I was conscious of a sudden wave of anger, the kind of anger which
youth invariably feels in the face of injustice. She had not seen
us, and I turned to my friend and whispered:</p>

<p>"You could make it very&mdash;unpleasant for her."</p>

<p>He smiled, and patted my shoulder.</p>

<p>"She is a woman," he said, as though this laconic phrase were
sufficient to dismiss any form of passionate judgment. Then he held
out his hand, and added: "Good night. Do not let her disturb your
dreams;" and he gave me a formal little bow and passed through the
door and out of my life.</p>

<p>Disturb my dreams! No, she shouldn't disturb my dreams, but she
was seriously disturbing my waking hours. Almost involuntarily I
ambled in the direction of the verandah. I sat on a wooden bench
below it, and I heard her talking, and these were the words which
reached me:</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor dear Serge, there was a genius if ever there was
one. Listen, darling, he would never have had the courage to
persist had I not so often told him success would one day come to
him. We were living in quite humble circumstances in those days, a
small flat with only one servant. Poor Serge used to despair, but
when things were at their blackest, I would take him by the hand
and whisper: 'Courage, my dear one, one little step down the fickle
road of destiny, and you will be there,' and I would lead him to
the piano-stool. I was always at his elbow. I was the rock upon
which he leant. During those long months when I nursed him night
and day, he clung to me for support and inspiration. He died in my
arms. 'Ah, my wife,' he whispered&mdash;and these were his last
words&mdash;'my wife, my love&mdash;my inspiration.' Isn't it
wonderful, darling, to have loved like that?"</p>

<p>A woman! Oh, my dear Monsieur Denoyel!</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. Juxtapositions</h2>

<p>"Where we are all mixed up," said my friend, Samuel Squidge,
vigorously scraping down the "portrait of the artist, by himself,"
with a palette-knife, "is in our juxtapositions. It's all nonsense,
I tell you. People talk about a bad colour. There's no such thing
as a bad colour. Every colour is beautiful in its right
juxtaposition. When you hear a woman say 'I hate puce,' or, 'I love
green,' she might as well say 'I hate sky,' or, 'I love grass.' If
she had seen puce used in a colour-print as Hiroshige the Second
used it&mdash;green&mdash;fancy <i>loving</i> green! The idiot! Do
you remember what Corot said? He said Nature was too green and too
badly lighted. Now the old man was quite right&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Squidge starts talking in this strain he is rather apt to
go off the deep end. I yawned and murmured sweetly:</p>

<p>"We were talking about Colin St. Clair Chasseloup."</p>

<p>"Exactly! And I'm trying to point out to you how, with Colin St.
Clair Chasseloup, it's all a question of juxtapositions. You say
that Colin is a frozen drunkard, a surly bore, a high-pressure
nonentity. Listen to me. We're all nice people, every one of us.
Give a man the right air he should breathe, the right food he
should eat, the right work he should do, the right people he should
associate with, and he's a perfect dear, everyone of him. There
isn't a real irreconcilable on the earth. But the
juxtaposition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What has Chasseloup to complain of? He has money, a charming
wife, children, a place in the country, a flat in town. He does
exactly what he likes."</p>

<p>Squidge surveyed me with amazement.</p>

<p>"You ass! You prize ass! I thought you wrote about people. I
thought you were supposed to understand people! And there you go
and make a smug, asinine remark like that."</p>

<p>I blushed, fully conscious that Squidge was being justifiably
merciless. It was an asinine statement, but then I was merely
putting out a feeler, and I could not explain this to the portrait
painter. After all, I did not really know St. Clair Chasseloup. He
was only a club acquaintance, and a very unclubbable acquaintance
he was. He appeared to dislike club life. To a stranger he seemed
to reek of patrician intolerance. He was an aristocrat of
aristocrats. His well set-up, beautifully groomed figure, clean-cut
features, well-poised head were all in the classic tradition of a
ruling caste. It was only about the rather heavy eyelids and the
restless mouth that one detected the cynic, the disappointed man,
the disillusioned boor. Why?...It was no affair of mine, the secret
troubles of this man's heart. But it was his business to behave
himself to me decently. To hell with Colin St. Clair Chasseloup! I
disliked the man. But then we all dislike people whom we feel
nurture an innate sense of superiority to us. Added to this trying
exterior of complete self-absorption and superiority, one had also
to allow for the vanity of the cripple.</p>

<p>St. Clair Chasseloup had lost his right leg just below the knee.
It happened before the war. Indeed, at the time when he was a naval
cadet at Osborne, skylarking with other young cadets, he had
slipped from a pinnace on a rough day and his right foot had been
crushed against the stone wall of a jetty. The leg had to be
amputated. That was the end of his naval career. And his father had
been a commodore before him, and his father's father was in the
Battle of Trafalgar, and so on right away back to the spacious days
of Elizabeth&mdash;all naval men. Devilish bad luck, you may say!
Of course, one had to allow for the bitterness that this misfortune
must have produced. At the same time it doesn't excuse a man not
answering when he's spoken to by a fellow-member at the club, or
for looking at one&mdash;like Chasseloup did!</p>

<p>Squidge's championship of the thwarted seaman amused me. You
could not conceive a more remarkable contrast. I was not even aware
that they knew each other. In spite of his missing limb, St. Clair
Chasseloup was the kind of man who always looked as though he had
just had a cold bath, done Swedish drill, and then passed through
the hairdresser's on his way to your presence. He was aggressively
fit. Squidge looked as though a walk to the end of the street would
have brought on valvular disease of the heart. From the centre of a
dank beard, limp ends of cigarettes eternally clung. Physically, he
was just comic. It was his vivid eyes and his queer excitable voice
that told you that he was a person of no mean vitality. He was just
as sociable and optimistic as Chasseloup was taciturn and moribund.
And yet they met on some old plane, it appeared. Well, well, I
could understand Squidge finding merit in Chasseloup, indeed in
anyone, but what would Chasseloup's opinion of Squidge be? It made
me shudder to contemplate. On the occasion I am recounting it was
almost impossible to extract any further intimate details out of
Squidge, for he had flown off on one of his pet theoretical
tangents.</p>

<p>"It's a queer rum thing," he was saying, "why people ever get
married at all. You simply can't get level with it&mdash;the most
unlikely, most outrageous combinations! The more outrageous the
more likely they are to be a success. You see some scraggy goat of
a woman and you think to yourself, 'Poor wretch! whatever sort of
chance has she got of getting married?' and the next thing you hear
is that she's married to some god who adores her, and they have a
large family of boys at Harrow and girls at Girton. Queer! Another
woman breathes sunlight and the men pursue her, and nothing
happens. She's unhappy. I know a woman who is married to a man she
is apparently in love with, and he with her. They have two jolly
kids, a boy and a girl. They are a most delightful, happy family.
They have money and are bursting with health and good spirits, and
yet nearly every year the mother gets fits of melancholia, and has
to go away to a nursing home and lie up for months. Some genius has
said that when contemplating marriage, what you want to seek in
common is not intellectual ambitions and tastes, it's recreations.
It's quite right. Generally speaking, a man's at work all day, so
is a woman. When they meet in the evening they want to get away
from it. It's the time when they spread their feathers. If they can
play and fool around they can be happy. Life for the most part is a
drab monologue. It's when you come to the accents you want each
other...If you can share the same tooth-brush with a woman for
twenty-five years and she can still surprise you, then you're all
right, both of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Squidge, what has your disgusting notion with regard to
the tooth-brush to do with St. Clair Chasseloup?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'm talking."</p>

<p>"I noticed that. Tell me frankly. Would you say that he and his
wife&mdash;Aim&eacute;e, isn't it?&mdash;have recreations in
common?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Bach."</p>

<p>"Bach! what are you talking about? Colin St. Clair Chasseloup!
Bach!"</p>

<p>"It seems funny to you, doesn't it? You know him and you've seen
her. You know him, all beef and phlegm, the immovable mass. A man
who thinks of nothing but dumbbells and double Scotches. And you've
seen her, the daughter of a hundred earls, highly-strung,
aesthetic, a little queer, passionately devoted to ultra-modern
music, Cou&eacute;, Montessori, anything and everything that crops
up. They've nothing in common, you might say. He's out all day,
playing a surly game of golf, or loafing in a club. She's playing
the piano, Ravel, Debussy, or some of those queer Russian Johnnies.
Or else she's inventing cute devices for the upbringing of the
precious children. He lets them rip. She spoils them. When you see
them together you would say that they were two people who had just
missed their last bus and had to walk home, each thinking it was
the other's fault. And yet I tell you they are the only two people
suitable to each other. They have a mutual appreciation of
accents&mdash;the same accents. They meet in the solemn tonal
climaxes of Bach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't believe that Colin likes Bach."</p>

<p>"I didn't once. I found out through my pal, Paul Furtwangler,
the 'cellist. He goes there several nights a week&mdash;she pays
him well, too&mdash;and he just plays Bach. It soothes the savage
beast. It keeps him at home, quietens him, stays his hand from the
whisky bottle. It's marvellous. He can't abide Chopin, or all the
jolly tuneful stuff barbarians like you and I enjoy. There's
something about it, I suppose, the orderliness, the precision, the
organic building up of solemn structures that just fills the kink
in his life made by his tragic defection. She hoiks him to St.
Anne's, Soho, to hear the oratorios. They chase the Bach choir
hither and thither. She plays it herself, although she's not much
of a performer. That's why she gets Furtwangler and sometimes the
Stinzel quartette. When they are listening to Bach together, they
meet on a plane of complete satisfaction. Of course, the war didn't
do him any good. He used to hobble backwards and forwards to
Whitehall doing some ridiculous anti-aircraft intelligence stuff,
and he used to look bitterly at his pals when he saw them prancing
backwards and forwards, with the salt of the North Sea bitten into
their faces. He was a good boy in those days, though. He left the
bottle alone, and only groused and grumbled. Weren't we all doing
that?...That's what I mean about people&mdash;married people
especially&mdash;you can never tell whether they are happy or not.
We all have to live our own lives in our own way. The breezy couple
who go about singing 'La, too, te rum, tum, tumple, rum, tum,
tootle, tootle, lay,' and who kiss in public, and say 'darling
this' and 'darling that,' you generally find that one or both
parties are carrying on a secret liaison with a cook or a
chauffeur. Colin has just got to be like that, and the woman
understands him. She doesn't want him different. While he is like
that she has a more complete grip over him, because she knows that
no other woman will understand or tolerate him. And they don't. Of
course, they quarrel sometimes, and he goes off and makes no end of
a beast of himself. But she knows she is secure. He will come
whining back to her like a whipped puppy. And he will grope for her
in the darkness, and she will hold his hand, and they will listen
to the solemn chords of a Bach fugue, and will feel horribly
melancholy, and tremendously moved, and somehow completely
satisfied. That's just people, they're like that. It's no good
arguing about it. I must be going. I'm going to have a Turkish bath
with Smithers."</p>

<p>The contemplation of Squidge in a Turkish bath talking to
Smithers, who is enormously fat, held me for the moment, and then
my mind reverted to Chasseloup.</p>

<p>Dash it! you couldn't help being interested in the beast. I had
to acknowledge that, in spite of his rudeness and indifference to
me, the man had somehow always attracted me. I suppose because I
wanted to know him, his rudeness and indifference piqued me all the
more. And his wife&mdash;well, there it was, I had only seen her in
concert-halls and theatres, and riding about in taxis with him, but
that peculiarly wistful face would have enslaved anyone. She was
slight and fragile, with pale face and very red lips, and that
curious gleaming blue-black hair that so often accompanies a pallid
complexion. Her eyes were wonderful, large, reflective, dark, with
terrific things going on in them all the time. At the same time I
shouldn't describe them as altogether unhappy eyes. They reflected
too much vital movement for that. The woman was living, and of how
many of these hard-bitten society women can you say the same?</p>

<p>It happened that a few nights after my talk with Squidge, I met
Chasseloup at the club. He was sitting in a corner of the
smoking-room, drinking whisky and being talked to by one of the pet
club bores. He occasionally growled a monosyllabic reply. After a
time the club bore retired and I was left alone with him. I sat
back and smoked, but did not speak. We must have sat like that for
nearly twenty minutes. There must have been something about this
conspiracy of silence which appealed to Chasseloup. I was aware of
him occasionally glancing at me, and at length he actually ventured
to address a remark. He said:</p>

<p>"This club whisky gets worse every day."</p>

<p>I believe I must have blushed with pleasure as I hastened to
acquiesce.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's awful stuff."</p>

<p>(Did you ever know a club where the members didn't all agree
that the food and drink supplied was the worst in town?)</p>

<p>After a few snappy sentences about the club whisky, Chasseloup
even went so far as to generalise. He said:</p>

<p>"Fancy reaching the stage of Colonel Robbins, a man who led a
brigade in South Africa, and now there's nothing left for him in
life but to serve on wine committees."</p>

<p>I was startled by this sociable reflection, and before I could
reply, he had capped it with:</p>

<p>"Even over that he's come to the end of his tether. His palate
is worn out."</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and rang the bell and ordered some more of the
inferior stuff. This insignificant conversation seemed to form a
bond between Chasseloup and myself. From that evening onwards his
attitude towards me underwent a change. It was not that he talked
much, but I was aware that I was one of the few members who didn't
get on his nerves. It was extremely flattering.</p>

<p>"All right, my friend," I thought. "I'll find out all about you
yet."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was a long interval of time between that
conversation and the eventful Sunday evening, when I met him and
his wife at the Minerva Musical Society's function at the Grafton
Galleries.</p>

<p>Now it is not of the slightest importance, except as it affects
the chronicle of the events I am about to describe, but I have to
say that my own tastes with regard to music are catholic,
cosmopolitan, and undistinguished. I like Chopin and Schumann, and
most of the Old Masters. I like Bach when I'm in the mood. I even
like Jazz music sometimes, and foxtrots, and barrel-organs, and Old
Bill playing his mouth-organ. But I must confess that what is known
as the modern British composer leaves me cold. Perhaps I'm not
educated up to him. And the activities of the Minerva Musical
Society are almost entirely concerned with the modern British
composer. Crowds of very precious overfed and underfed people meet
together, and they sit on little gilt chairs and burble with
delight about the productions of Mr. Cyrus P. Q. H. Robinson, or
the tone poem of Ananathius K. Smith. I know nothing about it. They
may be right. The only thing I have to record is that it bores me.
The only reason I went to this particular evening was&mdash;and it
is a weakness common to many weak-minded creatures like
myself&mdash;that my wife took me. She is more eclectic about these
matters than I am. She knows more, and so probably she is quite
right in believing that Cyrus and Ananathius are geniuses. That
isn't the point. The point is, I was frankly bored. And early in
the evening, looking round the room, and confessing to myself that
I was frankly bored, I suddenly happened to notice that the two
people who had just come in and were sitting just behind us were
Mr. and Mrs. Colin St. Clair Chasseloup. Immediately my boredom
vanished. Here was a human problem of more interest than the
scherzo movement of Mr. Cyrus P. Q. H. Robinson's F minor sonata. I
looked round and fidgeted, and my wife said: "Hush!"</p>

<p>And then without any question I heard Chasseloup say in a rather
rude, abrupt voice:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to listen to any more of this drivel."</p>

<p>And he got up and walked to the back of the room.</p>

<p>With two per cent. of his aplomb I got up and whispered:</p>

<p>"I don't care for this very much, dear. I'll just go and smoke a
cigarette."</p>

<p>I strolled out and found Chasseloup in the corridor. He was
looking thoroughly irritable. I went straight up to him and
said:</p>

<p>"What about a drink, Chasseloup?"</p>

<p>His face cleared perceptibly. He gave me quite a friendly nod,
and muttered:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I must now pay a tribute to that most sound of all social
conventions&mdash;namely, that of evening dress. It will carry one
through almost any difficulty. Chasseloup and I were both in
evening dress.</p>

<p>We wandered out into Grafton Street just as we were, without
hats or coats. He had gone barely twenty yards when I had to
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Good God! It's Sunday night! Everything is shut. We are just
five minutes too late. I'm awfully sorry old boy."</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch the play of expression on
Chasseloup's face. The jolt of irritation, the attempt to control a
recognition of the jolt, and then the sudden ugly thrust of the
chin. He merely said:</p>

<p>"Let's see what we can do."</p>

<p>But there was in that thrust all the perverse tendency of a man
who meant to get a drink, not because he particularly wanted it,
but because he was annoyed at being thwarted.</p>

<p>We took two sharp turns to the left&mdash;or the right&mdash;and
we came to a street, the name of which I mustn't tell you,
otherwise the whole story becomes almost libellous. In any case, we
were not five minutes' walk from the Grafton Galleries, and we were
going down a world-renowned street, consecrated chiefly to very
swell private clubs. Suddenly Chasseloup jerked out:</p>

<p>"That looks a good place. Let's try it."</p>

<p>From the exterior it was quite obvious what it was. It was a
very select private club, probably an exclusive ornithologists'
club, or a club consecrated to men who had won honours for
discovering the secrets of subaqueous plant-life. I don't know.
Chasseloup didn't know; but without the slightest hesitation we
strolled casually into the smoke-room. The commissionaire glanced
at us questioningly, but one look at Chasseloup convinced him that
he was wrong in his doubts. With a proprietary air, Chasseloup
flung himself into an easy chair on the right of the fire, and I
occupied the left. There were only two old gentlemen in the room,
and they were so absorbed in a conversation about goitres they
didn't notice us. An ancient waiter appeared&mdash;a man who must
have been there at least thirty years&mdash;and he came timidly
forward. He was about to take orders in a mechanical way, and then
he looked at us, and a curious sense, of misgiving seemed to creep
over him, not as though he were suspecting us, but as though he
were suspecting his own memory. Chasseloup, with his white
waistcoat and gilt buttons, his braided trousers and commanding
atmosphere, couldn't be anything but a most distinguished
member.</p>

<p>The waiter fumbled clumsily with a tray, and murmured
defensively:</p>

<p>"You gentlemen are stopping the night, I presume?"</p>

<p>An expression of unctuous indignation settled on Chasseloup's
features.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said.</p>

<p>The old waiter almost crawled on the carpet and took our order
for two double whiskies. Thus, you may see what a domineering
personality, backed up by evening dress, may accomplish. I could
not possibly have done this by myself, but in the presence of
Chasseloup I felt quite like an old member of this club of which I
did not even know the name.</p>

<p>Chasseloup was not by any means a drunkard. But I
discovered&mdash;at least, I have discovered later&mdash;that he
considers three double whiskies his right and lawful due for an
evening. They do not appear to have the slightest effect on him. We
had two in this club&mdash;we were in there less than ten
minutes&mdash;and then he said:</p>

<p>"We'll have one more somewhere else and then toddle back."</p>

<p>It appeared to me to have been a sufficient triumph to have
broken the laws of the land so successfully and speedily, without
challenging Fate further. Indeed, if we wanted one more drink we
could easily have obtained it where we were. But it was quite
patent that it was the very facility which was the obstacle in
Chasseloup's case. It was all too dead easy. There was no fun in
having a drink unless you had to fight for it. We had risen and
walked to the door. Just as we reached the entrance hall, a man who
looked like a butler came stealthily in from the street. He glanced
anxiously at us, and then going up to Chasseloup, he whispered:</p>

<p>"Limpo?"</p>

<p>Now Chasseloup naturally had got a limp, and I expected to see
this piece of impertinence drastically handled. Whatever was the
fool getting at? But Chasseloup gave no sign. He just stared hard
at the other, who quickly added:</p>

<p>"Her ladyship says will you come across immediately? I'll show
you the way."</p>

<p>Chasseloup hesitated for a fraction of a second, then, squaring
his shoulders, he said:</p>

<p>"Come on, then."</p>

<p>It was quite apparent that he had not the faintest idea what
adventure he was committed to. Crossing the street, I
whispered:</p>

<p>"What's it all about?"</p>

<p>And he whispered back:</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I guess we'll get our third drink."</p>

<p>We went into a palatial block of flats and entered a lift. We
were whisked up five floors and ushered into a heavily carpeted
hall. The butler left us and did not return for three or four
minutes. When he did he seemed all on edge. He said nervously to
Chasseloup:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;would you mind your friend waiting outside, sir?"</p>

<p>Chasseloup spoke emphatically:</p>

<p>"No, tell her ladyship that where Limpo goes Blotto
follows."</p>

<p>There was another interval, and then the butler returned and
asked us both to follow him.</p>

<p>We went into a large smoking-room, sparsely furnished. The room
was occupied by three men. They were all big men, and they were all
standing. On the hearthrug stood one of the most sinister-looking
individuals I have ever seen. He was very tall, with heavy
shoulders and a fierce black moustache and wicked eyes. There was
something about the way the men were standing I didn't like. It
appeared to be all carefully planned. The big man, whose voice
seemed surprisingly thin for his bulk, said banteringly:</p>

<p>"Oh, come in, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Limpo. Julius Lindt, perhaps I
should say. It pains me to tell you that her ladyship is not
present, unavoidably detained&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>Chasseloup bowed formally, and said in an ice-cold voice:</p>

<p>"I regret to hear it."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;um&mdash;yes. Yes, quite so. I can quite believe it. I
presume you are a great reader of <i>The Times</i>,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Limpo, Lindt I should say."</p>

<p>"I always read <i>The Times</i>," answered Chasseloup
politely.</p>

<p>"Yes, and write for them, advertise, too,
Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Lindt. Nice, friendly, loving little paragraphs,
eh?"</p>

<p>He held out a copy of <i>The Times</i>, the outside sheet
showing. Round one paragraph someone had put a blue pencil line.
The big man thrust it in Chasseloup's face and said:</p>

<p>"Just read that out, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a nasty dangerous tone in his voice. I didn't like it
at all. I began to think lovingly of the Minerva Society, the
little gilt chairs, and Cyrus P. Q. H. Robinson's F minor sonata.
Chasseloup was perfectly calm. He never took his eyes off the other
man's face. He said coldly:</p>

<p>"My friend, Blotto, will read it."</p>

<p>The paper was handed to me, and I read out from the agony
column:</p>

<p>"Molly. Am yearning for you. Shall be at the Club Sunday night.
If the Dragon is away, send over for me. All my love. Limpo."</p>

<p>I was too nervous to see the humour of the situation. Here was
the outraged husband and by great guile he had captured the wrong
<i>tertium quid!</i> How could one explain? Chasseloup's
regrettable limp appeared damning evidence. He had gone there, and
deliberately put his head through the noose. The situation was
appalling. The worst of it was, that under such circumstances men
do not stop to think and reason. Passion and mob-law are old
confederates. This fact was brought home during the ensuing
seconds. Everything seemed to happen in a flash. I was conscious of
the Dragon stretching out his hand towards a short, stocky
riding-whip, which had been concealed by the fireplace; of the
other two men stealthily closing in on Chasseloup. And then a
fourth man&mdash;was it the butler?&mdash;gripped me by the throat
from behind, and I was jerked towards the door. The idea was to get
me out of the way whilst the other three men horsewhipped
Chasseloup. I fell backwards into the hall, and the door slammed
to. At least, it nearly did. It was slammed with terrific violence,
but just in the nick of time a leg was thrust through. Now the
force with which it was pushed would have broken any ordinary leg,
but as it happened the leg that was thrust through was made of wood
and steel framing.</p>

<p>The arms above were apparently engaged elsewhere. The sight of
that upturned boot spurred me to action. I drove my elbows
violently into the ribs of my attacker. I heard him groan, and I
leapt forward to the door again. I think he must have been the
butler. I never saw him again. When I forced my way back into the
room, I think the moral effect of my presence was more valuable to
our side than any physical exploit I was likely to offer. Three men
against two are not overwhelming odds. The man just in front of the
door, who was gripping Chasseloup by the waist, hesitated, and paid
the penalty by getting a blow over his left eye. The other two men
were closing in, when Chasseloup ducked and got free. It was then
that I saw the man as he really was. His eyes were gleaming with
exultation. He was thoroughly enjoying himself. With a sudden
unexpected swerve he seized a vase and smashed the electric light
globes. The room was in darkness.</p>

<p>Now for a mixed body of men to fight in the dark is a dangerous
and difficult game. You do not know who is with you or against you.
Oaths were exchanged rather than blows. And the Dragon called
out:</p>

<p>"Where's Dawson? Where's that&mdash; butler?"</p>

<p>Then he gave a curse which showed that he was foolish to reveal
his whereabouts. One fool struck a match, which served no better
purpose than to reveal the point of his jaw, a fact that was
promptly taken advantage of. He went down and out. We were now two
against two, and one of them had a black eye that would last many a
week. The Dragon was blind with rage. He roared:</p>

<p>"Come out into the hall!"</p>

<p>And he stumbled out there and waved his arms challengingly. We
all followed him. The man with the black eye had had enough, and I
sat on the opposite side of the hall also a spectator. For it
seemed to be suddenly mutually agreed that this was an affair
between the Dragon and Chasseloup. They both wanted to fight. I
could have yelled out that the whole thing was a mistake, a
misunderstanding, that Chasseloup was not the man who had liaisons
with the other man's wife; but if I had done so I felt that
Chasseloup would never forgive me. He had already taken his coat
off, and so had the Dragon. And they fought. An affair of this
nature between two heavyweights seldom lasts long. It depends so
much on who gets in the first good blow. And in this case the fight
certainly didn't last three minutes. It was horrible. I don't know
whether the Dragon was much of a boxer. He certainly seemed to have
some knowledge of the game, but he never landed a blow. After a few
exchanges he received a punch on the nose, and the blood ran down
all over his dress shirt. Then he hit wildly, and suddenly received
three terrible blows in rapid succession; one on the chin, one on
the jaw, and then a fearful thump over the heart, which laid him
out. We were now in complete possession of the field, the man with
the black eye being the only conscious enemy in the flat, and he
had done with fighting for the day.</p>

<p>"Now, where's that butler?" said Chasseloup.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, for God's sake!" I exclaimed, foreseeing more
blood-letting. "Leave the butler alone. Let's get away."</p>

<p>"I'm not going till I get what I came for."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That drink."</p>

<p>The man with the black eye, who appeared to be some sort of
hired ruffian grinned in a sickly manner.</p>

<p>"All right, guv'nor," he said; "I can fix that for you."</p>

<p>He went into the dining-room and returned with a tantalus and
some glasses.</p>

<p>Chasseloup poured himself out his double whisky, just the exact
amount, and no more. Then he put on his coat and readjusted his
hair in the mirror. His face was unscratched.</p>

<p>"There's something perfectly disgusting about you," I
thought.</p>

<p>When he left the flat the Dragon was partly conscious, and he
was mumbling something about the police and firearms and vengeance.
We went down in the lift. Just as we were going out through the
entrance hall a typical young-man-about-town came up the steps. He
was limping. Chasseloup raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lindt, I presume?"</p>

<p>The young man started. Chasseloup smiled quite graciously.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is expecting you in the smoke-room," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The dude blushed and hurried on.</p>

<p>"But, good Lord!" I exclaimed, when we were in the street. "It's
a bit unfair. They'll half murder him."</p>

<p>"That's his affair," said Chasseloup. "Besides, it serves him
right&mdash;to go fooling about with another man's wife."</p>

<p>To look back on it, it seems almost unbelievable, but from the
moment when we left the Minerva Musical Society to the moment we
returned marks the lapse of rather less than an hour. And when we
returned nothing might have happened at all. There they all were,
the same people, the same little gilt chairs. Everybody looked
quite unconcerned, but nobody looked more unconcerned than Colin
St. Clair Chasseloup, lolling indolently on a stuffed settee at the
end of the room.</p>

<p>As it happened, they were just finishing some modern work, and
then there was an interval. Both our wives joined us and were
introduced. Mrs. Chasseloup was charming. She said:</p>

<p>"You bad men! where have you been?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, she added excitedly:</p>

<p>"Colin, you'll be pleased. Paul Tingleton's ill, and he can't
lead his quintette. And I've persuaded Mr. Oesler to end up with
the Bach fugue you love so much."</p>

<p>Queer fish, people are. A few minutes later we were drinking
lemonade and coffee and talking of such precious intimacies as the
colour of a musical phrase, and only a quarter of an hour
ago&mdash; Then we were back in the concert hall, Chasseloup and
his wife and my wife and I, and the great Mr. Oesler began to play
Bach.</p>

<p>And then the queerest thing of all&mdash;Chasseloup! Chasseloup,
whose face I had seen but a few minutes before ablaze with anger
and cruelty, suddenly mellowing, becoming gentle and wistful. And
he leaned forward with his lips parted, and his wife sat beside him
with an identical expression on her face. And then I saw his hand
steal towards her lap, and she took it in both of hers and gripped
it greedily. And they sat there, side by side, perfectly oblivious
to their surroundings, perfectly happy, like two children listening
to a fairy-tale.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. Burney's Laugh</h2>

<p>After breakfast was a good time. Throughout the day there was no
moment when his vitality rose to such heights as it did during the
first puffs of that early cigar. He would stroll out then into the
conservatory, and the bright colour of the azaleas would produce in
him a strange excitement. His senses would seem sharpened, and he
would move quickly between the flowers, and would discuss minor
details of their culture with Benyon the gardener. Then he would
stroll through the great spaces of his reception-rooms with his
head bent forward. The huge Ming pot on its ebony stand would seem
to him companionable and splendid, the Majolica plaques which he
had bought at Padua would glow serenely. He would go up and feast
his eyes on the Chinese lacquer cabinet on its finely-wrought gilt
base; and his lips would quiver with a tense enjoyment as he
lingered by the little carved Japanese ivories in the recess. Above
all, he liked to stand near the wall and gaze at the Vandyke above
the fireplace. It looked well in the early morning light, dignified
and impressive.</p>

<p>All these things were his. He had fought for them in the arena
of the commercial world. He had bought them in the teeth of
opposition. And they expressed <i>him</i>, his sense of taste, his
courage, his power, his relentless tenacity, the qualities that had
raised him above his fellows to the position he held. The
contemplation of them produced in him a curious vibrant
exhilaration. Especially was this so in the early morning when he
rose from the breakfast table and lighted his first cigar.</p>

<p>The great hall, too, satisfied his quivering senses. The walnut
panelling shone serenely, and brass and pewter bore evidence that
the silent staff whom his housekeeper controlled had done their
work efficiently. It was early&mdash;barely nine o'clock&mdash;but
he knew that in the library Crevace and Dilgerson, his private
secretaries, would be fidgeting with papers and expecting him. He
would keep them waiting another ten minutes while he gratified this
clamorous proprietary sense. He would linger in the drawing-room,
with its long, grey panels and splendid damask hangings, and touch
caressingly the little groups of statuary. The unpolished satinwood
furniture appealed to some special aesthetic appetite. It was an
idea of his own. It seemed at once graceful and distinguished.</p>

<p>He seemed to have so little time during the rest of the day to
feel these things. And if he had the time, the satisfaction did not
seem the same, for this was the hour when he felt most virile.</p>

<p>In the library the exultation that he had derived from these
aesthetic pleasures would gradually diminish. It is true that
Dilgerson had prepared the rough draft of his amendment to the new
Peasant Allotment Bill, and it was an amendment he was intensely
interested in, for if it passed it might lead to the overthrow of
Chattisworth, and that would be a very desirable thing, but
nevertheless his interests would flag.</p>

<p>He had a fleeting vision of a great triumph in the House, and
himself the central figure. He settled down to discuss the details
with Dilgerson. Dilgerson was a very remarkable person. He had a
genius for putting his finger on the vital spot of a bill, and he
had moreover an unfathomable memory. But gradually the discussion
of involved financial details with Dilgerson would tire him. He
would get restless and say, "Yes, yes. All right, Dilgerson. Put it
your own way."</p>

<p>He turned aside to the table where Crevace, coughing nervously,
was preparing some sixty odd letters for him to sign. A charming
young man, Crevace, with gentle manners and a great fund of
concentration. He was the second son of Emma Countess of Waddes. He
had not the great abilities of Dilgerson, but he was conscientious,
untiring, and infinitely ornamental.</p>

<p>He discussed the letters and a few social matters with Crevace,
while Dilgerson prepared the despatch-case for the Cabinet meeting
at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven a maid entered and brought him a raw egg
beaten up with a little neat brandy, in accordance with custom.</p>

<p>He told her that Hervieu, the chauffeur, need not come for him.
He would walk over to Downing Street with Mr. Dilgerson. As a
matter of fact, there were still one or two points upon which he
was not quite clear about the rights of rural committees. Dilgerson
had made a special study of these questions. It was a great
temptation to rely more and more on Dilgerson.</p>

<p>He enjoyed a Cabinet meeting. He felt more at home there than in
the House. He liked the mixture of formality and urbanity with
which the most important affairs were discussed. He liked to sit
there and watch the faces of his fellow-ministers. They were
clever, hard-headed men, men who like himself had climbed, and
climbed, and climbed. They shared in common certain broad political
principles, but he did not know what was at the back of any one of
their minds. It amused him to listen to Brodray elaborating his
theories about the Peasant Allotment Bill, and enunciating
commendable altruistic principles. He knew Brodray well. He was a
good fellow, but he did not really believe what he was saying. He
had another axe to grind, and he was using the Peasant Allotment
Bill as a medium. The divagations of "procedure" were absorbing. It
was on the broad back of "procedure," that the interests of all
were struggling to find a place. It was the old parliamentary hand
who stood the best chance of finding a corner for his wares. The
man who knew the ropes. He, too, had certain ambitions...</p>

<p>It seemed strange to look back on. He had been in political
affairs longer than he dare contemplate. Two distinct decades. He
had seen much happen. He had seen youth and ambition ground to
powder in the parliamentary machine. He had seen careers cut short
by death or violent social scandal. Some men were very foolish,
foolish and lacking in&mdash;moral fibre, that must be it. Moral
fibre! the strength not to overstep the bounds, to keep passion and
prejudice in restraint, like hounds upon a leash, until their veins
become dried and atrophied, and they lack the desire to race before
the wind...</p>

<p><i>He</i> had done that. And now he sat there in the sombre room
among the rustling papers, and the greatest Minister of them all
was speaking to him, asking his opinion, and listening attentively
to his answers. He forced himself to a tense concentration on the
issue. He spoke quietly but well. He remembered all the points that
the excellent Dilgerson had coached him in. He was conscious of the
room listening to him attentively. He knew they held the opinion
that he was&mdash;safe, that he would do the best thing in the
interest of the Party.</p>

<p>O'Bayne spoke after that, floridly, with wild dashes of Celtic
fun, and they listened to him, and were amused but not impressed.
O'Bayne, too, had an axe to grind, but he showed his hand too
consciously. He did not know the ropes.</p>

<p>As the meeting broke up, Brodray came up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, you know I'm dining with you to-night. May I
bring my young nephew with me? He's a sub, in town for a few days'
leave."</p>

<p>Of course he smiled and said it would be delightful. What else
could he say?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he would rather not have had the young sub.
He had arranged a small bachelors' dinner&mdash;just eight of
them&mdash;and he flattered himself he had arranged it rather
skilfully. There was to be Brodray, and Nielson, the director of
the biggest agricultural instrument works in the country, Lanyon
the K.C., Lord Bowel of the Board of Trade, Tippins, a big
landowner from the North, Sir Andrew Griggs, the greatest living
authority on the Land Laws (he had also written a book on
"artificial manures"), and Sir Gregory Caste, director of the
Museum of Applied Arts.</p>

<p>The latter, he felt, would be perhaps a little out of it with
the rest, but he would help to emphasize his own aspect of social
life, its irreproachable taste and patronage of the arts. It would
be a very eclectic dinner-party, and one in which the fusion of the
agricultural interests might tend to produce certain opinions and
information of use in conducting the Peasant Allotment Bill, and a
young red-faced sub dumped into the middle of it would be neither
appropriate nor desirable. There was, however, nothing to be done.
He and Brodray had always been great friends&mdash;that is to say,
they had always worked hand in hand.</p>

<p>He rested in the afternoon, for as the years advanced he found
this more and more essential. There were the strictest instructions
left that under no circumstances was he to be disturbed till
half-past four. In the meanwhile the egregious Dilgerson would cope
with his affairs.</p>

<p>At half-past four he rose and bathed his face, and after
drinking one cup of tea he rejoined his secretaries in the library.
In his absence many matters had developed. There was a further
accumulation of correspondence, and a neat typewritten list of
telephone messages and applications for appointments. But there was
no flurry about Dilgerson; everything was in order, and the papers
arranged with methodical precision.</p>

<p>He lighted his second cigar of the day and sat down. The
graceful head of Crevace was inclined over the papers, and the
suave voice of Dilgerson was saying:</p>

<p>"I see, sir, that Chattisworth has been speaking up in
Gaysfield. Our agent has written, he thinks it might be advisable
for you to go up North and explain our attitude towards the Bill to
your constituents. They must not be&mdash;er&mdash;neglected for
long in these restless times."</p>

<p>Yes, there was something satisfying in this. The sense of power,
or rather the sense of being within the power focus, the person who
understood, who knew what power meant, and yet was great enough to
live outside it. Strange why to-day he should be so introspective,
why things should appear so abstract! He had a curious feeling as
though everything was slipping away, or as though he were seeing
himself and his setting from a distance.</p>

<p>He gazed at Dilgerson with his square chin, and his neat
moustache, deftly stowing papers into a file whilst he spoke. He
momentarily envied Dilgerson with his singular grip on life. He was
so intense, so sure...</p>

<p>"Yes...yes," he said after a time, "we'd better go up there,
Dilgerson. As you say, they get restless. You might draft me a
rough summary of Chattisworth's points. Let me know what you would
suggest&mdash;precedents, historical parallels and so on. It is
true; they so soon get restless."</p>

<p>A feeling of apathy came to him after a time, and he left his
secretaries and strolled out into the Mall. A fine rain was
drifting from the south, and the tops of the winter trees seemed
like a band of gauze veiling the buildings of Whitehall. He went
into St. James's Park and watched the pale lights from the
Government Buildings. Some soldiers passed him, and a policeman
touched his hat.</p>

<p>Usually these things moved him with a strange delight. They were
the instruments of power, the symbols of the world he believed in.
But to-night the vision of them only filled him with an
unaccountable melancholy.</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered a day when he had strolled here with his
wife twenty-five years ago...</p>

<p>He passed his hand across his brow and tried to brush back a
certain memory. But it would not be denied. It was a grey day like
this. She had made some remark, something sentimental
and&mdash;entirely meretricious. He remembered vividly that he had
chided her at the time. One must not think like that; one must
restrain and control these emotional impulses. They are retrograde,
destroying. He had succeeded, risen to the position he held,
because&mdash;he had always been master of himself.</p>

<p>After his wife's death it had been easier to do this. His two
daughters had married well, one to the Bishop of St. Lubin, and the
other to Viscount Chesslebeach, a venerable but well-informed
gentleman, who had been loyal to the Party. His son was now in
India, holding a position of considerable responsibility. He was
free, free to live and struggle for his great ambitions. He was
fortunate in that respect; in fact, he had always been
fortunate.</p>

<p>He made his way back across the muddy pathway of the Mall,
imbued with a sudden uncontrollable desire for light and
warmth.</p>

<p>Gales met him in the hall and relieved him of his coat. There
was an undeniable sense of comfort and security about Gales. He
glanced furtively at the ponderous figure of his head "man," who
had been with him now longer than he could remember. He muttered
something about the inclemency of the weather, and it soothed him
to note the ingratiating acquiescence of the servant, as though by
addressing him he had conferred a great benefit upon him. He heard
the heavy breathing of Gales as he bustled away with his hat and
coat, and then he warmed his hands by the fire, and strolled
upstairs to dress.</p>

<p>As he entered his bedroom an indefinable feeling of dreariness
came over him again. It was very silent there, and the
well-modulated lights above the dressing-table revealed his
gleaming silver brushes and the solid properties of the mahogany
bed. He looked at the fire and lighted a cigarette, a very unusual
habit for him. Then he went into his dressing-room and noted his
clothes all neatly laid out for him, and the brass can of hot-water
wrapped in the folds of a rough towel. The door half-open revealed
the silver rails and taps in the bathroom, and a very low hum of
sound suggested a distant power station or the well-oiled machinery
of a lift. It was all wonderfully ordered, wonderfully
co-ordinated.</p>

<p>He strolled from one room to the other on the thick pile carpet,
trying to thrust back the waves of dejection that threatened to
envelop him.</p>

<p>At last he threw his cigarette away, and, disrobing himself, he
washed and dressed.</p>

<p>He felt better then, a little more alert and interested. He
turned down the light and went downstairs. He felt suddenly
curiously nervous and apprehensive about the dinner-party. He went
into the dining-room and found Gales instructing a new butler in
the subtleties of his profession. The table was laid for nine, and
indeed looked worthy of Gales and of himself. There was a certain
austerity and distinction about the three bowls of red tulips that
were placed at intervals along it, and the old silver and the
Nuremberg glasses, and the cunning arrangements of concealed lights
emphasised his own sure taste and discrimination. Nevertheless, he
felt nervous. He fussed about the table, and took the
champagne-bottles from their ice beds to satisfy himself that Gales
had brought up the right year. He fidgeted with one of the
typewritten menu-cards, and told Gales that on a previous occasion
Fouchet had overdone the Lucca oil in the Hollandaise. He must
speak to him. He was not sure that Fouchet was not going off. His
eyesight was failing, or he was becoming careless. The straw
potatoes served with the pheasant had been cut too thick, and his
savouries were apt to be too dry. Gales listened to these
criticisms with a lugubrious sympathy, and, bowing, he left the
room to convey them to the <i>chef</i>.</p>

<p>After that he retired to the small Japanese room on the ground
floor. When he had a bachelor party he preferred to receive his
guests there. There was something about the black walls, and the
grotesquely carved fireplace, and the heavily timbered ceiling,
also carved and painted dark red, that appealed to his sense of
appropriateness in a men's dinner-party. It was essentially a man's
room, a little foreboding and bizarre. It symbolised also his
appreciation of a race who were above all things clever; clever and
patient, industrious, aesthetic, with some quality that excited the
mystic tendencies of the cultivated Westerner.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait before two of his guests
arrived&mdash;Sir Gregory Caste and Lanyon the K.C. They had met in
the cloak-room, and, having previously made each other's
acquaintance at an hotel at Baden-Baden, were discussing the
medical values of rival Bavarian springs. It was a subject on which
he himself was no mean authority. The conversation had not
progressed far before Lord Bowel was shown in. He was a very big
man with a heavy dome of a head, large pathetic eyes and a thick
grey beard. He shook hands solemnly without any gleam of welcome,
and immediately gave an account of an incurable disease from which
his sister was suffering.</p>

<p>Tippins then arrived, a square-headed Northcountryman, who did
not speak all the evening except in self-defence, and he was
followed by Sir Andrew Griggs and Nielson. Sir Andrew was well into
the eighties, and Nielson was a thin, keen-faced man with very
thick glasses. There was a considerable interval before Brodray
arrived with his nephew. They were at least ten minutes late, and
Brodray was very profuse with apologies.</p>

<p>It was curious that the young man was almost precisely as he had
pictured him. He was just a red-faced boy in khaki. He fancied that
Brodray introduced him as "Lieutenant Burney," but he was not sure.
It was in any case some such name, something ordinary and
insignificant.</p>

<p>They then all adjourned to the dining-room without breaking the
general level of their conversation, and sat down.</p>

<p>On his right he had Lord Bowel, and on his left Sir Andrew
Griggs. Brodray faced him with Sir Gregory Caste on his right and
his nephew on the left. Lanyon sat next to the lieutenant, and
Nielson and Tuppins occupied the intervening spaces. He had thought
this arrangement out with considerable care.</p>

<p>It was not until the sherry and caviare had fulfilled their
destiny that Lord Bowel managed to complete the full description of
his sister's disease. He spoke very slowly and laboriously, and
moved his beard with a curious rotary movement as he masticated his
food.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Griggs then managed to break into the conversation
with a dissertation on the horrors of being ill in a foreign hotel.
He had once been suddenly seized with a serious internal trouble,
and had had to undergo an operation in an hotel in Zermatt. It was
very trying, and the hotel people were very unreasonable.</p>

<p>Brodray sang the praises of a new American osteopath during the
removal of the soup plates, and the salmon found the director of
the National Museum of Applied Arts dilating upon the virtues of
grape-fruit as a breakfast food.</p>

<p>The host was in no hurry. He knew that the course of events
would be bound to draw the conversation into channels connected
with matters that were of moment to the construction of the Peasant
Allotment Bill.</p>

<p>What more natural than that the virtues of grape-fruit should
lead to the virtues of fresh air and exercise, and then obviously
to horse-flesh. At the first glass of champagne, the company were
already in the country. Horses and dogs! Ah! how difficult to
eliminate them from the conversation of a party of representative
Englishmen!</p>

<p>Lord Bowel was the first to express his views upon the Bill. The
conversation led to it quite naturally at the arrival of the
pheasant. They were better cooked to-night, and the potatoes were
thinner, more refined.</p>

<p>He watched the curious movement of Lord Bowel's beard as he bit
the pheasant, and said in his sepulchral voice:</p>

<p>"The Groynes amendment will in my opinion inflict a grave
injustice on the agricultural classes. You may remember that in
Gangway's Rural Housings Bill in eighteen ninety-five, Lord
Pennefy, who was then on the Treasury Bench, said..."</p>

<p>The ball had started. He had a curious feeling that he wished
Dilgerson were there. Dilgerson had such a remarkable memory. He
particularly wanted to get Lanyon's views. Lanyon had a great
reputation among the people who knew. Unfortunately he was not a
good Party man. They said of him that he had a mind like a
double-edged sword. He was keen, analytical, and recondite; and he
did not mind whom he struck. The lawyer was listening to Lord Bowel
intently. His skin was dry and cracked into a thousand little
crevices, his cheek-bones stood out, and his cold, abstract eyes
were gazing through his rimless pince-nez at his empty glass. For
he did not drink.</p>

<p>Lord Bowel dwelt at great length on the Bill's unfortunate
attitude towards the agricultural labourer, and at even greater
length on the probable result of that attitude upon the
agricultural labourer at the polls. When he mentioned the Party he
sank his voice to a lower key, and spoke almost humanly.</p>

<p>The pheasants had disappeared, and little quails in aspic had
quivered tremulously in the centre of large plates surrounded by a
vegetable salad, the secret of which he himself had discovered when
living in Vienna, before Lanyon entered the arena with a cryptic
utterance, quoting from an Act of James II. He spoke harshly and
incisively, like a judge arraigning a criminal. It was very
interesting, for the host became aware that as Lanyon proceeded he
was not speaking from conviction. He had heard that Lanyon had
ambitions of a certain legal position. The Bill would not affect it
one way or the other, but his reputation as a dialectician must be
established beyond question. He had his game to play, too.</p>

<p>Nielson broke in and seemed to the host to agree with Lord Bowel
in an almost extravagant manner. He, too, spoke feelingly when the
Party was the theme. It was said that Lord Bowel was the power
behind the Chief. He certainly exerted a great influence in the
selection of office-holders. Men whose political reputation was not
made invariably agreed with Lord Bowel, in any case before his
face.</p>

<p>The game pursued its normal course, the even tenor of the men's
voices sounded one long drone of abstract passionless sound. Under
the influence of the good wine, and the solemn procession of
cunningly arranged foods, they sank into a detached unity of
expression. They looked at each other tolerantly, listening for
signs and omens, and measuring the value of each other's remarks.
There was no enthusiasm, no passion, nothing to belie the suave and
cultivated accents of their voices. They seemed perhaps unreal to
each other, merely a segregation of ideas meeting in a mirage,
without prejudice, or bias, or any great desire for personal
expression.</p>

<p>It was as the savoury was being removed that young Burney
laughed. The host did not catch what it was that made him laugh,
neither did he ever know. It was probably some mildly humorous
remark of Tippins. But it came crashing through the room like the
reel of pipes in a desert. It was not a boisterously loud laugh,
but it was loud enough to rise above the general din. It was the
quality of it that seemed to rend the air like an electric thrill.
It was clear, mellow, vibrant, and amazingly free. It rang out with
an unrestrained vibrato of enjoyment. It hung in the air and
satisfied its purpose; it seemed to lash the walls of the room and
hurl its message defiantly at the ceiling. It could not be subdued,
and it could never be forgotten. It was an amazing laugh. It was
like the wind on the moors, or the crash of great high waves
breaking on a rock, something that had been imprisoned and suddenly
breaks free and rides serenely to its end...</p>

<p class="poem">"And the saintly Cybeline"&mdash;</p>

<p>It was curious. Why, immediately he heard the young man's laugh,
did this line occur to him? Gales was standing by the sideboard
looking flustered and perturbed. People did not laugh in the
presence of Gales. He had a faculty of discouraging any flippant
digressions from the dignity of politics or dinner. Lanyon was
looking in the young man's direction, his keen eyes surveying the
wine-glasses set there.</p>

<p>Old Sir Andrew looked at him also and smiled dimly; but,
surprisingly enough, the others hardly seemed to have noticed the
laugh.</p>

<p>Lord Bowel was saying:</p>

<p>"If, therefore, we are prepared to accept this crisis which the
Opposition&mdash;with a singular lack of insight, in my
opinion&mdash;seem disposed to precipitate upon the country, we
shall be&mdash;er&mdash;lacking in loyalty not only to
the&mdash;er&mdash;Constitution, but to ourselves, and I said to
the Chief on Wednesday..."</p>

<p class="poem">"And the saintly Cybeline"&mdash;</p>

<p class='noindent'>What on earth did it mean? What was Lord Bowel
talking about? Why did the young man's laugh still seem to be
ringing round the room? He looked at him, the boy was talking
animatedly to Brodray and grinning; he thought he caught something
about "we didn't sleep under cover for a fortnight." He had not
been drinking&mdash;certainly not to excess. No one had had sherry
except the silent Tippins. He might have had three glasses of
champagne. It certainly didn't account for the laugh; besides, it
was not that sort of laugh.</p>

<p class="poem">"There was something, something, something,<br>
And the something will entwine,<br>
And the something, something, something<br>
With the saintly Cybeline."</p>

<p>A shadowy vision glimmered past the finger-bowl in front of him.
He remembered now&mdash;it was in Frodsee's room at Magdalen. There
was a tall chap, with curly dark hair, sitting on Frodsee's table,
swinging his legs. He was in "shorts," and his bare knees and
stockings were splashed with mud. Frodsee himself was standing by
the window, declaiming his ridiculous jingle. And there was a third
boy there who was laughing uncontrollably.</p>

<p class="poem">"With the saintly Cybeline."</p>

<p>He wished he could remember the rest of the words. The sun was
streaming through the window, and the young willows were whispering
above the river. The jingle finished and they all laughed, and one
laugh rang out above the rest. Strange that it should all come
rushing back to him at that moment&mdash;the free ring of his own
laughter across the years! He had something then, he couldn't think
what it was, something that he had since lost.</p>

<p>"Even if in the end we have to sacrifice some of these minor
principles, I am inclined to think, sir, that the broader issues
will be better served...The interests of the Party are
interdependent..."</p>

<p>Nielson was speaking, nervously twisting the cigar in his
mouth.</p>

<p>He made a desperate plunge to find his place in the flow of this
desultory discussion. He mumbled some inchoate remark upon the Land
Laws. It was not in any way germane to what had just been said, and
he knew it, only he wanted them to draw him back among them, to
protect him from the flood of perverse memories that strove to
increase his melancholy.</p>

<p>But the memory of that laugh unnerved him. He could not
concentrate. He longed once more for Dilgerson, or for some power
that would give him a grip upon his concrete existence. He rose
from the table and led his guests back into the Japanese room. He
lighted a cigar, and, contrary to his custom, he indulged in a
liqueur. His guests formed themselves into little groups, and he
hovered between them, afraid to remain with either long, in case
they should discover his horror, that in that hour&mdash;all
through a boy's laugh&mdash;he had lost the power to
concentrate.</p>

<p>Perhaps something in his manner conveyed itself to his guests,
for they broke up early. First old Griggs, then Nielson, then
Brodray, and the boy. He shook the boy's hand, but made no
comment.</p>

<p>Lanyon took his departure alone, and Tippins followed. Lord
Bowel seemed the only one disposed to remain. He sank back in an
easy chair and talked interminably, unconscious of any
psychological change in the atmosphere of the room. He found a
patient listener in Gregory Caste, to whom the discussions of a
Government official were as balm.</p>

<p>The host moved restlessly, blinking at his two remaining guests.
Sometimes he would sit furtively on the edge of a chair and listen,
and nod his head, and say, "Yes...yes, I quite agree. Yes, that is
so."</p>

<p>Then he would rise, and walk to the fireplace and move some
object an inch or two from the position in which it was placed, and
then move it back again. He drank a glass of lemon-water, a row of
which were placed on a silver tray by the wall, and smoked another
cigarette. Then the instinct of common courtesy prompted him once
more to join his two remaining guests. He looked closely at Lord
Bowel's heavy cheeks, and a curious feeling of disgust came over
him. The voice of the Board of Trade official boomed on luxuriously
about the arts of Eastern people, about ceramics, about the
diseases of bees, the iniquity of licensing restrictions, the
influence of Chaldean teaching on modern theology, on the best
hotel in Paris, on the vacillating character of the principal
leaders of the Opposition. There seemed no end to the variety of
theme, and no break in the dull monotony of voice.</p>

<p>It must have been well after midnight that Lord Bowel suddenly
sighed heavily and rose. He took his host's hand and said
gloomily:</p>

<p>"It has been a most delightful evening."</p>

<p>He watched the two men pass out into the hall, and saw Gales
come ponderously forward and help them with their coats. Then he
drew back and looked into the fire. He pressed his hand to his
brow. He had not a headache, but he felt peculiarly exhausted, as
though he had been through some great strain. In the fire he saw
again the nodding heads of willows and the young clouds scudding
before the wind...He started. He could not understand; he could
have sworn that at that moment he again heard someone laugh. He
looked round to convince himself that he was alone in the room. He
shivered and stood up. He was not well. He was getting old. A time
comes to all men&mdash; Anyway, he had not been a failure. He had
succeeded, in fact, beyond his wildest dreams. His name was known
to everyone in England. His features even graced the pages of the
satiric journals. He was the "safe" man of the Party. One paper had
nicknamed him "Trumps," the safest card in the pack. It was
something to have achieved this, even if&mdash;he had sacrificed
things, impulses, convictions, passions, the fierce joy of
expressing his primitive self. Perhaps in the process he had lost
something.</p>

<p>Ah, God! He wished the young man had not laughed.</p>

<p>There was a gentle tap on the door, and Gales came in.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir!" he murmured softly.</p>

<p>"It's all right. I'm going to bed."</p>

<p>He rose weakly from the chair and went upstairs. Once more in
the bedroom, the silence tormented him. The furniture seemed no
longer his own, no longer an expression of himself, but a cold,
frigid statement of dead conformity. He touched the bed, and then
walked up and down. What could he do? He had no power to combat the
strange terrors of remorse that flooded him. He sat there silently
waiting for the mood to pass. He knew that if he struggled it
<i>would</i> pass. He would be himself again. It was all so
foolish, so unworthy of him. He kept saying that to himself, but
underneath it all something else seemed stirring, something that
went to the roots of his being and shook him violently.</p>

<p>He waited there a long time, till the house seemed given over to
the embraces of the night, then he stealthily crept downstairs
again. It was all in darkness. He turned on the light in the hall
and dining-room. He wandered to his accustomed chair at the
dining-table and huddled into it. He struggled to piece together
the memories of days of freedom and splendour, when he had
sacrificed nothing, when life was an open book.</p>

<p>He visualised little incidents of his childhood and schooldays,
but they seemed trivial and without significance or humour.</p>

<p>Ah, God! if he could laugh!</p>

<p>He started suddenly at the sound of someone moving in the hall.
He knew instinctively it would be Gales. He jumped up. He did not
want his loyal retainer to think him a fool. It would be the most
terrible thing of all to appear ridiculous to Gales. He walked
round the room nervously peering at the floor.</p>

<p>Gales blinked at him. He was in a dressing-gown, and he
mumbled:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>He glanced at Gales but said nothing. He continued searching the
floor. Gales advanced into the room and coughed, and looked at him
curiously. He had never known Gales look at him before in quite
that way. He felt suddenly angry with the servant and wanted to get
rid of him, but at the same time he was self-conscious and afraid.
He was aware of the level tones of Gales's voice murmuring:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, may I help you? Have you lost anything? Can
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horror came home to him with increased violence as he
glanced at the puffy cheeks of the butler. He felt that he could
not endure him for another moment. He almost ran to the door,
calling out in a harsh voice as he did so:</p>

<p>"Yes...yes. I've lost something."</p>

<p>He brushed past the butler, his cheeks hot and dry, and his eyes
blazing with an unforgiving anger. He did not turn again, but
hurried away, like an animal that is ashamed to be seen, and ran
whimpering upstairs to his bedroom.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. The Baby Grand</h2>

<p>Note: This story contains antisemitism and racism which many people<br>
will find objectionable.&mdash;Project Gutenberg Australia.

<p>When the Gabril family first came to live in Camden Town, Gabril
was not their name. They were reputed to have come from Silesia,
and to have arrived with a name that was quite beyond the
capabilities of the neighbourhood to pronounce. Some genius
invented the name of Gabril for them, and it was probably a
contraction of a more grandiose nomenclature. They were of Jewish
stock, but had long ceased to practise or conform to any religious
creed. It may almost be said that they had ceased to conform to any
creed at all. They were a thoroughly unpleasant family. Solomon
Gabril, the father, was a piano-tuner. He had been married twice,
and both his wives had died. By his first wife he had two sons and
two daughters&mdash;Paul, Mischa, Selma, and Katie. By his second
wife, one daughter, Lena.</p>

<p>At the time when this story commences, Paul and Mischa were in
the early twenties, Selma was eighteen, Katie seventeen, and Lena
thirteen. They lived in three rooms and a scullery in a dingy house
in Benthal Street. Solomon was a thoroughly competent piano-tuner,
otherwise it is quite certain that the eminent firm of piano
manufacturers in Kentish Town would not have tolerated him. He was
dirty, untidy, wheezy, and vacillating. He indulged in drinking
bouts, when nothing would be seen of him for days. When sober his
manner was ingratiating, and somewhat facetious. He had a perpetual
sneering grin. He was, however, not entirely without feeling, and
not entirely a fool.</p>

<p>He was not capable of studied cruelty. He wished well towards
his family, and would give them the best of everything, if it
hadn't been that there was barely enough for his own indulgences,
and self came first. He paid the rent, allowed Selma, the eldest
girl, a sufficient sum weekly to buy the bare necessities of life
for the rest, and he never struck the children. It cannot be said
that either of his sons had so good a character. Paul was frankly
what is known as "a bad egg." He had been to prison twice for petty
thefts. He never kept a situation for more than a few weeks. He was
idle, depraved, and quarrelsome. Mischa was less objectionable than
his brother. He was quieter, had never been convicted in crime, but
was phlegmatic, morose, and stupid. He worked in a candle
factory.</p>

<p>Selma was a narrow strip of a girl, with eyes too close
together. She surreptitiously spent money meant for the food of the
family on trinkets. She was supposed to manage the household, and
to do the cooking and cleaning, and, during such time as she could
spare from the local picture-house, she did make some sort of
effort in this direction. She was furtive and selfish.</p>

<p>Katie, who did various odd jobs in teashops and private houses,
was more like her brother Mischa. She was of the flaccid kind, and
sighed her way through the dreary monotony of her days.</p>

<p>The whole family lived in a continuous state of hunger and
irritation, with the exception of Mr. Gabril, who was not
particularly interested in eating, but who always managed to get a
good dinner every day at a coffee-shop, and who drank sufficient
beer both to feed himself and to keep him in a static condition of
oleaginous indifference to the troubles of others.</p>

<p>Being, as it were, engrafted on to this deplorable family tree,
one may readily imagine that the conditions and prospects of the
youngest child, Lena, were anything but roseate. She was quite
obviously different from the rest. Her mother had been a singer who
died at Lena's birth. The child had a broad plump face, and dark
brown reflective eyes. She was curiously reserved, and she endured
the insults and bullying of her sisters, and the cuffs of her elder
brother, with almost uncanny fortitude, as though when all was said
and done she was stronger than they; as though she had enduring
treasures to defend.</p>

<p>She was sent to the local church school, more with the idea of
getting her out of the way, and keeping her out of mischief, than
with benefiting her with the liberal education obtainable at that
institution. Having bundled her off to school, the family interest
in her education and progress vanished. But it was instilled into
her in early life that she was the only one who contributed nothing
to the general upkeep of the house, and that the sooner she grew up
and went out and earned her living the better it would be for her.
She slept in one bedroom with the two step-sisters, the three men
occupied the other, whilst the third room was dubbed facetiously
"the parlour" by Mr. Gabril. It was the room where the whole family
congregated, fed, quarrelled, and indulged in whatever recreations
were available. It was furnished with a dilapidated sofa, four cane
chairs, two packing cases used as chairs, a deal table, a fitted
cupboard, an oleograph of King Edward as an admiral, and several
coloured plates taken from Christmas numbers. It had a smell of its
own, in which fish, cabbage, smoke, drying clothes, and unwashed
humanity mingled in degrees varying with the time of day and the
state of the weather.</p>

<p>Lena was not allowed to sit on the sofa, which was usually
occupied by the males, or in their absence the other two girls. She
usually sat on a packing-case by the window, and there she would
pore over her school books, trying to learn her lessons, amidst the
general din, bickering and disorder.</p>

<p>The family took no interest in her activities, other than those
which affected themselves. On her part she formed outside
friendships, and developed ambitions which she never imparted to
the rest.</p>

<p>And then one day a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>It was evening, and the family had just finished supper. The
boys had gone out. Mr. Gabril was sprawling on the sofa, smoking,
and reading the evening paper. Selma was washing up in the
scullery, Katie was making herself a blouse, and Lena was sitting
on her packing-case, reading, when there came a knock at the door.
Mr. Gabril said: "Come in!" and there entered a young, rather
good-looking clergyman.</p>

<p>The surprise and consternation of the family were immense. The
visit of a policeman could not have created a greater shock. Mr.
Gabril started as though he expected to be accused of some dreadful
vice. Katie dropped her sewing. Selma, catching sight of the
visitor through the open door, swiftly wiped her hands on a dry
rag, and prepared to re-enter the room. Lena alone seemed unmoved.
The stranger said, cheerily:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gabril?"</p>

<p>"That's my name," said Mr. Gabril, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Gabril. My name is Winscombe, of
the&mdash;er&mdash;church schools. I wanted to have a word with you
about your daughter. Ah! good-evening, Lena!"</p>

<p>The mystery deepened. He nodded familiarly to Lena, who smiled a
recognition. Now, what was this all about? The family had no
particular use for clergymen, a cold, repressive, prying lot. At
the same time, he was certainly a pleasant, gentlemanly fellow.
There might be something to be got out of him. The grin returned to
Mr. Gabril's face.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "I don't know. What's it about?"</p>

<p>Selma, who had entered the room, and liked the appearance of the
young man, <i>qua</i> young man, had a brain-wave. She said:</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, sir?"</p>

<p>He bowed, and replied:</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you. Your other two daughters, I presume.
Good-evening! Good-evening!"</p>

<p>He sat down and balanced his hat on his knee. Then he began
speaking eagerly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Gabril, we think your daughter has talent,
decided talent. I expect you know she was introduced to my sister
by Miss Watson at the school, who suspected her of being musical.
My sister has been giving her lessons for the last year, and she is
very impressed, very impressed indeed. My sister is not a great
musician herself, and she is of opinion that Lena should go to
someone more advanced."</p>

<p>"Well, the deuce! The nasty, furtive little cat! Why has she
said nothing about this?" reflected Mr. Gabril. Outwardly, he
continued to grin, and he spluttered out:</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh yes! Well, well!"</p>

<p>His mind became active. Plays the piano, eh? Well, what did the
fellow want? Did he think that he, Solomon Gabril, was going to
spend money on piano lessons? Was he such a fool as that? On the
other hand, if she could play, perhaps there was money in it.
Perhaps she could go on and play at the pictures. He'd heard of
girls getting two or three pounds a week at the game. Well? The
young fellow continued to talk.</p>

<p>"It has all fallen out rather fortunately, I hope you'll agree.
A friend of ours, a comparatively wealthy man, who is also a
musical patron, introduced her to Soltz, the well-known professor.
Lena played to him yesterday, and he too was impressed by her
extreme promise. My friend is willing to pay for a course of
lessons for her with Herr Soltz, I presume you would have no
objection?"</p>

<p>Something for nothing was entirely in keeping with Mr. Gabril's
sense of social morality. But what about this? In what way did
<i>he</i> benefit? It wanted thinking over. These people evidently
had money. It would be much better if they gave the money to him,
and <i>he</i> supervised the girl's musical education. On the other
hand, if they taught her to play properly&mdash;well, there was
money in that. Perhaps it would be better to agree in the meantime.
He said:</p>

<p>"Oh, really? Very nice, I'm sure&mdash;very nice."</p>

<p>The clergyman continued:</p>

<p>"She will, of course, be leaving school shortly, and then, if
she is allowed to devote her whole time to music, we think she may
go far&mdash;very far indeed."</p>

<p>"Playing for the pictures?" said Mr. Gabril, tentatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, farther than that, I trust."</p>

<p>"Playing at concerts, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, and giving her own recitals, and being engaged by
orchestral societies, becoming a great artiste, in fact."</p>

<p>Mr. Gabrielas eyes narrowed. He was a piano-tuner. He knew
something about the profession. There were people like Paderewski
and Pachmann making a lot of money. It had not occurred to him to
associate his scrubby little daughter with the dazzling side of a
musical career. He had not known till that moment that she knew a
note of music. This was an historical day in the history of the
Gabril family. But it had its reaction.</p>

<p>When the clergyman had gone, Selma flared up. She was jealous
and furious. She went up to Lena and said:</p>

<p>"You little sneak!" and she slapped her face. And then Mr.
Gabril saw red. He grabbed Selma, and screamed at her:</p>

<p>"You fool! Leave her alone, or I'll shake the life out of
you!"</p>

<p>Selma cried, and Lena cried, and Katie joined in the general
uproar, and eventually said she felt sick and was going to bed.
Their individual emotions were at cross-purposes. Selma couldn't
see that her father was primarily concerned with the commercial
potentialities of the situation. She accused him of taking Lena's
side against her, who did all the work. <i>She</i> was only drudge.
<i>She</i> wasn't given piano lessons. Rich people didn't come
chasing after <i>her</i>. A nice thing it was. She supposed Lena
would be having dancing lessons next, and be going to Buckingham
Palace to be presented at Court. Selma was very hysterical, her
mind a little confused by a film she had seen that afternoon,
called "The Heir to Millions." It was a thoroughly unpleasant
evening, and was not improved by the late advent of the two
brothers, both rather drunk. They were too drunk to be impressed by
the news about the clergyman's visit. Paul laughed
boisterously.</p>

<p>"A parson, eh?" he kept on repeating. "Fancy a parson coming
'ere!" He seemed to think it was quite the funniest thing that had
ever happened.</p>

<p>For several weeks Lena was subjected to a running fire of
jeering comments, vindictive on the part of her step-sisters,
ironic and inane on the part of her brothers. It was only Mr.
Gabril himself who displayed' any kind of tolerance. He cannot be
said to have shown any great sympathy, but he licked his lips and
leered, and bade the others shut up. He told romantic stories of
vast fortunes made out of playing the piano. None of the others
believed him. It was a dream so outside their normal conception of
life as lived in Camden Town that they could not visualize it. It
was possible that romantic figures in other settings did such
things, but scrubby little Lena, with whose superfluous person they
had been herded day and night all her wretched
life&mdash;nonsense!</p>

<p><br>
The only note of reality was struck three weeks after the
clergyman's visit, for one day a piano arrived. It was what is
known as a baby grand, and was put in "the parlour." Now this was a
concrete and astonishing occurrence. A piano costs money. Amidst
the packing-cases and flimsy furniture of the Gabrils' parlour it
struck a flamboyant, an alarming note. If it had been an ordinary
upright piano it would not have seemed out of place, but a grand!
Even Paul was slightly awed, and Selma disagreeably impressed. It
seemed to take up all the room, to be insolently assertive. Its
contempt for the flimsy furniture oozed from its shining black
sides. It was like a large Persian cat of ancient pedigree finding
itself in a room full of scraggy, ill-born kittens.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabril chuckled with satisfaction. He ran his fingers over
the keys, playing the few florid harmonies he was accustomed to
indulge in on his tuning rounds. It was a magnificent piano. The
angle of the family's attitude towards Lena shifted a little. What
if there were something in it after all? Each one naturally thought
of his or her own interests. "Suppose she does make money, where do
I come in?"</p>

<p>They stood round the piano in a group and made her play. They
seemed to expect some astounding miracle to happen right away. They
wanted her to give some definite proof that gold would quickly flow
as a result of her exertions. They were disappointed. She certainly
seemed to play all right. But she played very dull pieces. There
was nothing about the performance to dazzle or surprise.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they granted her a certain amount of freedom. She
was allowed to practise for several weeks unmolested, until the
novelty of the situation began to wear off. They got tired of her
scales, arpeggios, and repetitions. Besides, nothing was being said
about paying her large sums for playing in public. Paul wouldn't
let her play at all when he was in the house. Mischa brought home a
young man friend, who banged out jazz tunes for two evenings
running. Selma began to find the piano useful for piling up plates,
and pans, and pots. In three months' time the piano had ceased to
be an object of awe. Respect for it vanished. It became part and
parcel of the room. Its lid was scratched and marked. It was piled
up with papers and plates and odd rubbish. Lena only practised when
the others were out, and then she was always being interrupted by
knocks at the door, barrel-organs in the street below, or the
irksome duty of haying to keep one eye on a boiling pot.</p>

<p>Twice a week she went over to Kensington, and had a lesson from
Mr. Soltz. As her father refused to give her any money she had to
walk there and back, always hungry, frequently exhausted, ill-shod,
shabbily dressed, rain-soaked. But her eyes continued to glow with
the fire of her prescribed purposes, and a smile was ever ready on
her lips.</p>

<p><br>
A whole year passed before the deplorable incident in connection
with the piano happened.</p>

<p>Lena had left school. She was over fifteen. It was pointed out
to Mr. Gabril very forcibly by the other members of the family that
she might now be out earning money. There was no sign yet that all
this piano-playing was going to be any good. She might go on doing
it for years, and who was going to keep her? Why should she be
allowed to idle about at home, strumming on a piano, when Katie had
to go off every morning to a tea-shop?</p>

<p>Paul went out of a job, and Selma had become engaged to a flashy
young man who served in the stores, and backed horses. She wanted
to get married, and, of course, they had no money to start
housekeeping on. That fact was probably the basis of the idea which
led to the regrettable incident, that and Paul's unemployment and
depravity. It is certain that at the height of this condition of
discontent and disorder, Paul and Selma put their heads together.
They were both desperate and without moral bias. They plotted a
devilish dishonesty. One day, when everyone was out except these
two, a gentleman in a bowler hat paid them a visit. He made a
careful examination of the piano, and the three of them whispered
together in a corner.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday afternoon, Lena was over at
Kensington, having a lesson. Mr. Gabril was out tuning, and Katie
was, of course, at business also. A van drove up. Four men in green
aprons came upstairs. They picked up the "baby" as though it really
were a baby. They carried it gently downstairs and deposited it in
the van. The foreman handed Paul an envelope, and they drove off.
Paul and Selma had sold the piano for seventy pounds!</p>

<p>The plot was ingenious, but somewhat incomplete. They had taken
the precaution to deal with a firm in South London, and payment was
made in cash. It was obvious that they must not disappear. They
must brazen the thing out. Selma was to say that she was alone in
the house when the piano people called and said they had
instructions to take the piano away and restore it. She knew
nothing about it. She supposed it was all right. Nevertheless, it
was a risky game. It all depended upon what attitude Mr.
Winscombe's people might take. They might advertise. Paul and Selma
would have to stick together, and lie like anything. They shared
the spoil, but both felt dreadfully frightened. And, curiously
enough, Selma felt less frightened of detection than she did of
Lena. What would Lena do? There was something queer and uncanny
about the kid. You never knew what she would do.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for Paul that the transaction was a cash one.
He went out into the street with thirty-five pounds in his pocket.
He was not a good subject to have so much money on him. He had
never had so much before in his life. He was frightened and very
desperate. He went straight down the road and had three whiskies.
Then he began to see things more clearly. There would be a row. He
might be arrested, put in prison&mdash;anything. What did he care
about the family? Thirty-five pounds seemed an enormous sum. He
could live for months, and then perhaps something else might turn
up, another scoop. He wasn't going back to that house. Of course,
he had promised to stick by Selma, but still&mdash;what did it
matter? Selma could look after herself. Women were always all
right. Let's have a good night out first, anyway. He went up
West.</p>

<p>After an orgy that lasted three days and nights, he took a train
to Brighton, where, in the fullness of time, he married a fat
elderly lady, who owned a green-grocer's shop. His subsequent life
does not concern us, but, if rumour is to be believed, he got all
he deserved.</p>

<p>Selma was pluckier than Paul, and a little more cunning. To her
surprise, Lena took the news more philosophically than she had
expected. At first, of course, she believed Selma's story that they
had sent for the piano to do something to it, but, even when the
truth came out, that it had indeed been stolen, she only seemed a
little dazed and surprised. It was as though there were within her
vibrant forces that could not be deflected by the mere removal of
material things.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Gabril who caused Selma most trouble. He was furious.
He saw at once that some trick had been played, and he regarded the
playing of tricks as his own prerogative. He had, indeed, for some
time nurtured this identical idea of selling the piano, and he
would have done it more efficiently. He had many friends in the
piano-dealing world, friends who were capable of keeping their
mouths shut, too. He would have got a good price, and he did not
believe there was anything in Lena's future, or, if there were, it
would take too long to materialize.</p>

<p>When Paul failed to return the father's suspicions naturally
centred upon him. He accepted Selma's statement unquestioningly.
Well, what were they going to do? Selma hinted at keeping the
matter quiet.</p>

<p>"The piano was only lent. They will hold us responsible," she
said.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" yelled the father. "What's the good of that? They're
bound to find out in time. Besides, I'm going to find out who did
this dirty trick. I'm going to have my revenge."</p>

<p>"Suppose it was Paul?" said Selma, turning rather pale.</p>

<p>"If it was Paul he can go to gaol for it. He's been there
before. It's about the only place he's fit for," said the boy's
father.</p>

<p>Selma cursed her brother in her heart. The coward! The sneak!
Fancy running away, leaving her to bear the brunt of the whole
danger! How like a man!</p>

<p>Lena was only concerned with the question as to where she was to
practise, and on what piano. She went the first thing next morning
and reported the matter to Ih r. Winscombe. That gentleman arrived
later with a lawyer. Selma was closely cross-examined. She gave her
version of the case, only omitting the fact of Paul's
disappearance.</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Winscombe had an interview with Sir Robert
Ashington, the music patron and owner of the piano. He was a thin,
scholarly-looking old gentleman with snow-white hair.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, on hearing the clergyman's report, "what
are we to do about it?"</p>

<p>"We have already notified the police, and Channing suggests that
we might advertise it. If the firm who bought the piano are a
<i>bona fide</i> firm they might be willing to come forward. But
if, as is most likely, they got it for a song, they may keep quiet.
It is easy enough to sell a grand piano, and comparatively easy to
alter the number or change it in such a manner that after a little
interval they could dispose of it with safety."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect the family?"</p>

<p>The clergyman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"They are a terrible crowd, sir, terrible. They are certainly
capable, either individually or collectively, of doing such a
thing. The father, of course, is the most likely. He is in the
piano trade, and would know how to go to work."</p>

<p>"What about the child?"</p>

<p>Mr. Winscombe smiled.</p>

<p>"She is splendid. She came to me this morning, and there were
tears in her eyes. 'Oh, Mr. Winscombe,' she said, 'don't tell me
this is the end! I shall go mad if I cannot go on playing!'"</p>

<p>There was a certain humidity about the eyes of the older
man.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" he said. "Well, well, let us fix her up first. She
had better have a room in some respectable house we know of. I dare
say we can find her another piano. I saw Soltz two days ago. He
says she is making astonishing strides."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Winscombe got busy. He had no room available in his
own house, but after a rapid search he made arrangements with an
American widow, who lived with her son and daughter in a large
house in Regent's Park. Her name was Mrs. Bouverie Bennington. She
was a warm-hearted, sympathetic woman, interested in social
questions, clever, and well read. She had a music-room and a grand
piano, which was seldom used in the day-time. Her son was at
college, and her daughter was not musical. She gave Lena permission
to go there and play whenever she liked.</p>

<p>An advertisement was put in the papers, but no reply was
received. Neither were the police ever able to solve the mystery of
the vanished baby grand. After a week or two, Selma breathed more
freely, but she was still frightened and entirely discontented with
her lot. She suffered from sleeplessness, and nightmares in which
giants in green baize aprons played pitch and toss with enormous
grand pianos that were for ever about to drop on her head. She
determined to marry her flashy young shop-assistant at the earliest
possible moment. She told him she had saved thirty-five pounds out
of her housekeeping money, and he, immediately inspired by the
thoughts of this noble endowment, conceived a great scheme by which
it could be trebled by a cunning system of backing outsiders for
small sums. Selma had no great faith in this, but after
considerable discussion she advanced him ten pounds to experiment
with. Unfortunately for Selma's future life, the investment was
surprisingly successful. It happened during the ensuing month that
several most unlikely outsiders romped home to a place. The ten
pounds accrued to forty-seven pounds, and they got married and went
to live in rooms at Holloway. Selma's half-share of the piano
bought her married life&mdash;so she also got her deserts.</p>

<p>Her departure was the beginning of the slow disintegration of
the whole Gabril family. Mischa went out to Canada, and they did
not hear from him again. Katie wanted to come home and take Selma's
place, but Mr. Gabril could not see that there was any point in
that. She was making good money: let her stop where she was. The
rooms could look after themselves. The three of them pigged along
as best they could.</p>

<p>A whole year went by. A year and eight months, and then Katie
was taken suddenly ill. She had to go to a hospital and have an
operation. It was not a serious operation, but in her anaemic and
enfeebled condition it proved too much for her. She died under the
anaesthetic.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabril was now running rapidly to seed. The firm still
employed him, but he was entrusted with less and less orders. His
income became automatically less. He began to regard Lena
restlessly. It was quite time she was making money&mdash;all this
talk about a great career! He had been gambling on it, perhaps
foolishly. She might be earning a pound a week or so at some honest
job. He went to see Mr. Winscombe, and explained.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said that gentleman, "your daughter is getting on
splendidly. Everyone is delighted with her. They say she will be a
great artiste. But she must have time. It would be cruel to take
her away now."</p>

<p>"How much time?"</p>

<p>"At least another two years. She might give lessons before
then."</p>

<p>Two years! And he had got to keep her all that time? Oh no, the
game wasn't worth it. He growled an incoherent disapproval,
borrowed five shillings from the clergyman, and came away.
Something would have to be done. That evening he took Lena severely
to task.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," he said, "that parson said you could give
lessons. You'd better get busy and find some pupils. If you don't
get pupils within the next week I shall take you away and put you
in a job."</p>

<p>It happened that evening that Selma called with her husband. She
seemed querulous and tearful. The betting system had been a
complete failure since their marriage, and she was going to have a
baby. What were they going to do? Things were bad enough as it was.
How could they afford a child as well? And George was in debt up to
his eyes. George did not give the impression of being in debt. He
was well clothed and groomed, and his silver cigarette-case was
always flashing. He laughed indulgently at his wife. All would be
well when the flat-racing season started. He had had some very
sound information straight out of the horse's nose-bag.</p>

<p>"When are you going to start making all this money?" Selma
suddenly asked Lena.</p>

<p>"What money, Selma?"</p>

<p>Even Mr. Gabril was aghast at this flippant reply. Money! What
did the girl think she was doing all this ivory-thumping for? Fun?
Pleasure? As a matter of fact, Lena had given the subject little
thought. She had at times dreamed that she might one day be rich,
and then she would like to go about helping people, even her own
people, even Selma. But she did not associate the surging calls of
her muse with making money. It was so much bigger and beyond that,
so much more tremendous. Of course, she wanted to do her duty. She
didn't want to be mean, but she knew that in this social struggle
she was born to she had to fight her own battles.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can get some pupils," she said defensively.</p>

<p>During the next few days she did look round and make inquiries.
But pupils were not at all easy to secure. No one had heard of Lena
Gabril. She looked too young to have the authority of a teacher.
She consulted Mr. Winscombe, and in the end, on his recommendation,
a lady in the Camden Road engaged her to teach her two little
girls. She was to be paid thirty shillings a term for giving the
little girls twelve lessons each.</p>

<p>She broke the news t? her father with triumph, but to her
chagrin he received it angrily.</p>

<p>"Thirty shillings!" he whined. "What's the good of thirty
shillings? You ought to be earning thirty pounds a term."</p>

<p>Thirty pounds! Oh, dear! That would mean teaching forty little
girls twelve hours each a term. Four hundred and eighty hours out
of the term. When was she to practise? She would have to be cunning
with her father, humour him, pretend she was trying t? get more and
more pupils. The terrible menace of a "job" hung over her. She
imagined herself in a pickle factory or a draper's shop, or perhaps
out at service. The reflection drove her to work harder and harder
at her piano. She said nothing about the kindness Mrs. Bonnington
was showing her. She pretended she just went to a house, practised
in a room, and came away without seeing anyone. She dreaded that
her father might call, make a scene, borrow money, and behave in
some disgraceful fashion. Some profound instinct of
self-preservation prompted her to remain mute concerning the
delightful lunches and teas and talks she had with Mrs. Bennington
and her son and daughter. She had discovered a new world, a world
she had only been able dimly to imagine through the medium of
music. She was emerging through the dark mists of her upbringing
into a realm of light and understanding. She did not mean her
father and step-sister to drag her back without a bitter
struggle.</p>

<p>Two months passed before the climacteric was reached. She had
not been able to get any more pupils. Her father got more and more
vindictive, bitter, and inclined to violence. Mr. Gabril had been
on one of his periodic orgies. He arrived home one evening, his
eyes bloodshot and his breath whisky-laden. He had spent all his
money and he wanted more. Lena, of course, had none.</p>

<p>"Go and get some," he roared.</p>

<p>"Where can I get any money?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You lazy little slut!" he screamed, in a higher pitch. "Thirty
shillings a term you earn, do you? I've been keeping you for
seventeen years. To-morrow you'll come along with me. I'll get you
a job with a pal of mine who runs a public-house. That's what I'll
do. He said he'd give you a job&mdash;barmaid, see? In Kentish
Town. You'll like it. A nice merry life, plenty of boys and booze,
see? Now, you go right along to that woman in the Camden Road and
collect the thirty bob she owes you, and bring it back to me at
once. Go on, hurry up!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that," said Lena, colouring up. "I couldn't call
there in the evening like this and ask for money."</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't, couldn't yer?" said Mr. Gabril. "You couldn't
do what yer father tells yer, couldn't yer? Take that!"</p>

<p>And he struck at her. Lena was expecting this. She put up her
arm and parried the blow. She cowered against the wall. Her eyes
narrowed. She said quietly:</p>

<p>"All right. I'll go."</p>

<p>She put on her hat and cloak, tidied her hair in the broken
mirror, and went slowly out. After she had gone Mr. Gabril felt
ill. His heart was behaving queerly. He flopped on to the sofa and
lay down.</p>

<p>"I want a drink," he kept on repeating, "that's what's the
matter with me&mdash;hope she'll be quick. I want a drink."</p>

<p>He waited some time till drowsiness crept over him, and then he
sank into a drunken sleep. He was next conscious of cold,
discomfort, and wretchedness. He struggled through the coma to find
himself. When consciousness came it seemed only partial. Where was
he? What had happened? It was raw daylight, and he was lying on the
sofa in the parlour...Why, yes, of course, he had had a bit of a
binge. But why was he here? Where was Lena? Lena? Why, yes,
something had happened. Bit of a row, eh? He remembered now he had
sent her out to get some money. Where was she? He called out:</p>

<p>"Lena!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. He got up and stumbled to the girl's
bedroom. She was not there. Where the devil was she? He visited
each room in turn, and wandered out on to the staircase. It was
broad daylight, must be nearly midday, and she had gone out last
night. What had happened to her? Accident? Perhaps she'd jumped
into the canal because he'd struck her. Girls were like
that&mdash;silly, hysterical creatures. But Lena wasn't exactly the
sort. But what was he to do? He felt ill, and he had no money. He
crawled back to the sofa.</p>

<p>He lay there for hours in a kind of torpor, hoping that Lena
would return at any moment. There was a little food in the house,
but he felt too unwell to eat. Once he worked himself up into a
violent fit of rage. He swore and blasphemed loudly, but, finding
this only made him feel worse, he desisted. When the room began t?
get dark again he became desperate. He scribbled a note to Selma,
telling her to come and see him at once. He got a boy on the floor
below to take it, on a promise of sixpence. Then he waited in the
increasing gloom.</p>

<p>It was three hours before Selma came. She came alone. He cursed
her for being so long, and she lost her temper. When she heard of
Lena's disappearance her expression became blacker still. When her
father suggested accident or suicide she cried out savagely:</p>

<p>"Not she, you fool! That's not her luck. I felt it from the
first. She's gone to her rich friends."</p>

<p>"Where do they live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Somewhere in Regent's Park. I've never been
there. I don't know their name."</p>

<p>"I'll make the devils pay for this. How can we find them?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Winscombe would know."</p>

<p>"That's right, curse him! You go round now and find out. Got any
money, Selma? If so, for God's sake get me a drink first."</p>

<p>"I haven't any money for drinks for you, but I'Il go round to
Mr. Winscombe."</p>

<p>Mr. Gabril growled, and Selma went out. She felt tired herself,
but there was a sense of grim satisfaction in being able to hand
her step-sister over to the father's vengeance. Mr. Winscombe was
out, but he was expected in. He kept her waiting half an hour. When
he arrived he said that he knew nothing about Lena's disappearance.
He had not seen Mrs. Binnington for weeks. However, he reluctantly
gave Selma the name and address.</p>

<p>Armed with this weapon of vengeance, Selma returned to her
father. She found him lying face downwards by the fireplace.</p>

<p>She gave a feeble scream when she felt his stiff body. Then she
stood up and looked around her. The instinct of self-preservation
was fortified by her condition. She had no love for her father. She
looked at the sticks of furniture and reflected. She knew her
father had no money. But there were three rooms furnished in a way.
The whole lot would fetch several pounds. There was an unborn child
to consider, and the flat-racing season was not being any goad. Who
should have this furniture if not she?</p>

<p>She looked at the crumpled paper in her hand&mdash;Lena's
address. What should she do about that? If Lena had gone to live
with these people, she couldn't prevent her. She was a little
frightened of educated people&mdash;indeed, a little frightened of
Lena herself. Besides, if she returned she might claim her share of
the furniture. She flung the paper in the fireplace. Let Lena go
her own way. Let her rot.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
One spring morning seven years later Selma was walking down Great
Portland Street. Her right hand was holding the hand of a chubby
little girl of four. Under her left arm was a bundle of washing.
She took that narrow turning that runs by the side of the Queen's
Hall. Suddenly her eye alighted upon the lithograph of a portrait
that seemed familiar. Underneath the portrait in large black type
'vas printed "Lena Gabrielski," and then in red type, "First
appearance since her brilliantly successful American tour." Hardly
had she recovered from her astonishment at recognizing Lena's
portrait when a figure came down the steps from the artistes' door.
It was Lena herself. The two women looked straight into each
other's eyes. Lena was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Selma!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Selma was entirely nonplussed. She did not know how to act. She
let go of the child's hand and shifted the bundle from one arm to
the other, as though anxious to conceal it. She looked from Lena to
the poster, and said at random:</p>

<p>"Why do you call yourself that funny long name?"</p>

<p>Lena glanced at the poster.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was my agent's idea. How are you, Selma, and who is
this small person?"</p>

<p>"It's my little girl."</p>

<p>Lena stooped and took the child's hand.</p>

<p>"And what is your name?"</p>

<p>The child's eyes kindled at the vision of this beautiful lady so
beautifully gowned.</p>

<p>She said: "Irene."</p>

<p>Selma stood apart, consumed with the consciousness of jarring
contrast. Her own slatternliness, her bundle, her baby, and this
other woman with the clothes, the manner, and faint perfume of the
well-bred. Could it be possible that they had the same father? She
felt angry. A tear came into her eye, and she groped for the
child's hand as though anxious to escape. But the child was
apparently too occupied to notice her mother's anxiety. She
appeared to have suddenly made a new friend. When Lena had finished
her little talk she turned to Selma and said:</p>

<p>"Selma, I tried to find you once or twice, but you had moved and
no one knew your address. Why didn't you write to me?"</p>

<p>Selma didn't know what prompted her to do it, but she felt an
abrupt desire to hurt Lena, to hurt herself even more. She said
bitterly:</p>

<p>"Do you know it was me and Paul that stole your piano? We sold
it and shared the spoil."</p>

<p>Lena gave a little gasp. It was her turn to cry, but a smile
struggled through her tears. She pressed her step-sister's arm.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Selma. You did me a great service. If you had not
taken the piano I should never perhaps have met my&mdash;my
husband. And we are so happy, Selma."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;married!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I married Mrs. Bonnington's son. We live at
Hampstead. Won't you come and see us? I have babies of my own. I'd
like to help you, Selma."</p>

<p>For a moment the elder woman wavered. She dug her hard fingers
tighter into the bundle of washing. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the good?"</p>

<p>A policeman at the corner watched the two women interestedly.
Their behaviour struck him as peculiar. Was the woman with the
bundle and the baby trying to beg? It didn't seem quite like it. In
fact, it looked almost the other way about. The child, too, seemed
to be taking an important part in the discussion and was appealing
to its mother. Was there going to be a scene? He strolled at the
law's pace in their direction. Before he reached them, however, he
saw the lady hail a taxi. The three of them entered it, and drove
off in the direction of Hampstead.</p>

<p>"Um!" he muttered to himself. "Rum creatures&mdash;women!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. Business and Desires</h2>

<p class="cpb">"For every man hath business and desires, such as they are."</p>

<p>Frederick James Smith stretched himself luxuriously in front of
the fire of King Cup Villa. His consciously proprietary attitude
appeared justified, as indeed it was. It may have been a little
accentuated on this evening, because he had been informed that day
that his salary in future was to be five pounds a week instead of
three pounds fifteen&mdash;a well-merited recognition of his seven
years' service to Messrs. Bole &amp; Binspit, the famous West End
firm of furnishers and upholsterers.</p>

<p>From the little kitchen at the back came the sound of his wife's
voice humming an Indian love lyric as she washed up the sardiney
plates from their supper. Through the thin walls he could hear a
piano player in the adjoining villa. Frederick James lighted a
cigarette and glanced at a copy of the Evening News, but he was too
happy toread. Getting on. He enjoyed fleet glimpses of more and
more getting on&mdash;infinite possibilities. They said that old
Pagson, the head salesman, was making more than a thousand a year.
Mr. Binspit himself lived in Grosvenor Court, and had another house
at Maidenhead. It only wanted a bit of luck here and there. A
romantic and interesting life, a furniture sales man's.</p>

<p>His wife entered the room with a handful of knives and forks,
which she deposited in the plate basket on the sideboard. He
watched her sorting them out and putting them in the different
compartments as she continued to hum Pale Hands I Knew. Remarkable
things, women. The vision of her quickened his sense of
proprietorship. Here was Gladys, wife, mother of his child, running
the little villa, doing the housework and the cooking, cleaning and
mending, nursing the baby, doing the shopping, keeping the
accounts, and yet in the evening looking smart and sweet, even
humming passionate music. Whatever her duties, she always kept a
little corner for romance. And she was his, intensely and
ultimately his&mdash;the thing he owned more completely than
anything in the world. The instant she had adjusted the silver she
darted upstairs to peep at the baby. When she returned she was no
longer singing, but she carried a basketful of socks. She sat down
on the cane chair on the left of the fireplace and began to examine
the socks. The master of the house spoke.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, old girl, we might go to the pictures
to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>The wife and mother thoughtfully threaded a darning needle</p>

<p>"Um! We might, if I can get Bessie to come in for a couple of
hours. We mustn't be late, though."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Frederick James sat down and toyed with the poker.</p>

<p>"They're fairly letting that piano player go to-night, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's rather a pretty piece, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Um!"</p>

<p>They sat in silence for some time, listening. Then Gladys said:
"Been busy to-day?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the business man lighted up.</p>

<p>"I should think we have! Rush, rush, rush all day. Getting out
specifications for that Tilgate job. Chap must have pots of money,
having a marble hall and a walnut billiard room. Some blokes do
have luck."</p>

<p>"Don't you grumble, old thing. You're doing all right."</p>

<p>"I'm not grumbling. I'm only saying. I like it. There's lots of
romance in the furnishing trade. You'd be surprised. Things
happening all day. Rich people and that. You see into their lives.
You'd be surprised the things you see. I suppose, except for
doctors, no one sees so much of the inner life of the rich as the
furnisher. And it's rush, rush, rush all the time. I get to that
state when nothing surprises me. The things we see! The only rule I
make is I never ask questions. Whatever I see in folks' houses, I
say nothing. It's not my business."</p>

<p>He lighted another cigarette and took up the newspaper. The cozy
little intimacy had helped to soothe him.</p>

<p>He read out odd paragraphs of interest to Gladys. Then he wrote
a letter to a firm of ironmongers, expressing the opinion that
their estimate for repairing a sewing machine was excessive. He
went out and posted it, and bought a packet of cigarettes. Then he
came in and locked up the cat in the scullery. Gladys tidied up and
turned out the gas. At a quarter past ten they were in bed.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock next morning they breakfasted, and at
twenty-five minutes past he kissed his wife and said: "Well, what
about the pictures to-night?"</p>

<p>She brushed the rim of his coat collar and replied: "Yes, all
right. Where shall we meet?"</p>

<p>"What do you say to that A. B. C. in the Strand?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Righto then. Be there at six o'clock, and we'll have a couple
of poached eggs on toast or a sausage, and then we can goto one of
those picture shows in Cranbourn Street."</p>

<p>"Right you are, dear. Don't be late."</p>

<p>He walked to the corner and caught his bus, and had the good
fortune to secure a strap. At four minutes to nine he was at his
desk. He had put his umbrella in the corner and was about to remove
his overcoat when one of the porters came up and said: "Mr. Smith,
Mr. Binspit wants to see you in his office the moment you
arrive."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>What was this all about? A sudden misgiving came over him that
there had been a mistake about his increase. Or was he to be put up
into an even more exalted position? He stared vacantly at the
papers on his desk, then he walked quickly through to the holy of
holies and tapped on the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Binspit's secretary was binding up some drawings. He glanced
at Frederick James and said: "Here is Smith, sir."</p>

<p>"Come in, Smith."</p>

<p>The head of the firm stood up. He was a tall, imperturbable,
elderly man with polished manners and a beautifully tonsured
beard.</p>

<p>He remarked, "Let's see; what are you doing, Smith?"</p>

<p>"I'm on the Tilgate job, sir."</p>

<p>"You must leave it. I want you to come with me. Get your order
book and a notebook and meet me down at the front door in five
minutes' time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>In four and a half minutes' time Smith was standing by the front
door like a sentry on duty. Mr. Binspit did not keep him waiting.
He came through in the impressive manner that had been one of the
assets of his career. He ignored Frederick James and walked
straight through to the pavement. His car was waiting. He pointed
to a seat.</p>

<p>"Get in."</p>

<p>The car glided up Oxford Street. The chief twirled his mustache.
As they were passing Hyde Park he condescended to remark: "We are
going to Richmond. A new client, Mr. Marshall
Flaxton&mdash;American. Appears to be in a great hurry. I don't
know what the job is. You may have to stay there all day."'</p>

<p>"That's all right as long as I get to the A. B. C. in the Strand
at six o'clock&mdash;in time to meet the missus," thought
Frederick, but he only said, "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The run to Richmond lasted less than half an hour. The car
entered the park and took a side road in the direction of Kew.
Suddenly it entered a drive between long beds of rhododendrons in
full bloom and came to a halt before the portico of a large Queen
Anne house. The front door was open and a man who had apparently
been expecting them stepped forward and nodded. He was a small,
oldish man, with cracked-parchmenty skin and keen brown eyes. He
said: "Bole &amp; Binspit?"</p>

<p>Mr. Binspit bowed.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Binspit. This is one of my junior salesmen."</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall Flaxton glanced at them both, and to Frederick's
surprise he felt that he himself was the object of the greater
interest.</p>

<p>"Come right in."</p>

<p>They walked across the hall. The house was apparently empty and
unoccupied, but Mr. Flaxton called up the staircase: "Ella, they've
come!"</p>

<p>There was the sound of hurrying footsteps on the bare boards,
and almost immediately a stoutish old lady came hurrying
downstairs. She appeared flurried and out of breath. She ejaculated
"Morning," and put her hand to her heart. Frederick was equally
aware when she glanced at him that there was something about his
appearance which occasioned surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Flaxton exchanged glances, then he turned briskly
to Mr. Binspit and said: "Now, if you don't mind, I'll do the
talking. Time presses."</p>

<p>There was a series of reception rooms connected by folding
doors. Mr. Flaxton turned to Frederick and said: "Shorthand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Get out notebook. Room One&mdash;Heppelwhite drawing-room
suite, two Chinese lacquer cabinets, Turkey carpet, felt
surround&mdash;got that? Right! Two majolica vases for overmantel.
Heavy brocade curtains in style, three full-length portraits,
Georgian period, gilt Italian coffer&mdash;got that? Right! Comeon!
Room Two."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Flaxton had reached Room Five the eyes of the
imperturbable Mr. Binspit were starting out of his head. Frederick
was unmoved. He went on calmly entering the instructions in his
notebook. Mrs. Flaxton trotted along in the rear, like a faithful
sheep dog.</p>

<p>"The man must be mad," thought Binspit.</p>

<p>But the reputation of Marshall Flaxton, the nitrate and potash
king, was good enough to justify a little insanity.</p>

<p>At Room Five a French window opened into a conservatory. Mr.
Flaxton said to Frederick: "Go in there and roughly estimate cubic
dimensions."</p>

<p>Frederick James stepped through, and then as he stood on the
other side, owing to the echo of the empty rooms he overheard a
remark not intended for his ears. He heard Mr. Flaxton say: "Is
this the kind of fellow who can mind his own business?"</p>

<p>And he heard Mr. Binspit answer: "I chose him for that purpose.
I think he is the kind of man you asked for."</p>

<p>They went over the whole house. There was to be no painting or
decorating; no arrangements for lighting, nothing done to the
kitchen; but the house was to be filled with costly furniture,
carpets, curtains, pictures and bric-a-brac.</p>

<p>When the party eventually arrived back in the hall Mr. Binspit
cleared his throat and said in his best manager-directing voice:
"Well, Mr. Flaxton, I think your wishes are quite clear. We can let
you have a specification and estimate in the course of a week or
so."</p>

<p>Mr. Flaxton took out his watch.</p>

<p>"It's five minutes of ten," he muttered as if to himself. Then,
tapping the other on the forearm, he exclaimed: "I didn't ask you
for a specification or an estimate. It's five minutes of ten. I
want the job done by three o'clock to-day."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;excuse me! Do I understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want the job done by three o'clock to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's quite impossible.'</p>

<p>"How many men do you employ?"</p>

<p>"Oh, several thousand altogether&mdash;scattered about."</p>

<p>"You can call them off other jobs."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the cost would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask about the cost. Aren't there automobiles and motor
lorries? Aren't there telephones? Haven't you any stock? Is London
bereft of old furniture? Is your firm bereft of enterprise? I
repeat, I didn't ask the cost."</p>

<p>The pupils of Mr. Binspit's eyes seemed to narrow to a pin
point. He looked like a terrier watching the approach of a rabbit,
and yet not quite convinced that it really was a rabbit. He
fidgeted with his handsome beard and took several paces up and down
the hall.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Flaxton jerked out: "Section it out. Fifteen
salesmen&mdash;each responsible for a room. Order fleet of motor
lorries to be ready by twelve o'clock. Have fifty men waiting here
for them. So many detailed to each room. Holy Moses, there's
nothing to do but put the furniture in its place!"</p>

<p>"'But&mdash;the carpets! The curtains!" wailed Mr. Binspit
despairingly.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," suddenly remarked Frederick James quietly.
"There are those brocade curtains which are now ready for Lord
Gastwych St. James. I believe they would be just the size for these
rooms."</p>

<p>"Bright lad!"' chirped Mr. Flaxton</p>

<p>"But Lord Gastwych was in yesterday. He was
complaining&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, forget the lord! I'll pay you three times what he's
paying."</p>

<p>Frederick James again spoke.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but if Mr. Flaxton could have the surrounds
stained instead of laying down a felt it could be done quickly, and
with that stain we use now it dries in half an hour. In that case
there would be no difficulty, if those curtains fit."</p>

<p>"Good! That's right, boy. Telephone at once for forty French
polishers to come down in taxicabs. There's a telephone in that
little room by the lavatory."</p>

<p>Mr. Binspit eventually found himself caught up in the whirl of
his client's enthusiasms. He telephoned for nearly a hundred
workmen to come down at once in taxicabs. He gave instructions that
no one was to leave the premises of Bole &amp; Binspit and that all
salesmen and workmen on outside jobs were to report instantly. Then
he took Frederick's shorthand notes and went away in his car,
leaving Frederick to act as a kind of foreman of the whole
undertaking.</p>

<p>When his chief had gone Frederick wandered through the rooms,
planning the campaign. He left Mr. and Mrs. Flaxton whispering
together in the hall. He had not been left to his own devices for
ten minutes before a car drove up to the door and there was a
violent ringing of the bell. He walked through into the hall,
feeling that it was perhaps his place to open the door, but Mr.
Flaxton had forestalled him. He observed a young, fair and pretty
girl in a great fluster of excitement.</p>

<p>The first words she uttered were: "Well, pop, nothing been heard
of the count?"</p>

<p>"Not a sign."</p>

<p>"Who the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frederick was con scious of being scrutinized by startled
eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaxton glanced abruptly over his shoulder and ejaculated:
"The upholsterer's man. They've promised to make good by three
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Fine! But, say, did you ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Frederick withdrew to the inner room he distinctly caught the
phrase: "Most extraordinary resemblance."</p>

<p>It was not his business to take an excessive interest in his
clients' affairs and conversations, and he was just measuring the
width of the bay in the second drawing-room when he saw another car
drive up and three Chinamen get out. One was gorgeously appareled,
obviously a potentate of some sort accompanied by two secretaries.
They rang the bell, and he heard Mr. Flaxton admit them.</p>

<p>"Sixteen feet three inches by five feet four and a half,"
murmured Frederick, making a note in his book. Then he looked up
and found Mrs. Flaxton standing at his elbow. She appeared
agitated. She beckoned him to accompany her into the farther
room.</p>

<p>When they arrived there she whispered: "Hide your notebook,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Smith, madam."</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith, do not be alarmed about anything. You shall be well
recompensed for any inconvenience. Something unexpected has
happened. There is no time to enter into details, but for certain
purposes, which are very urgent&mdash;very pressing&mdash;we may
wish to pass you off as someone you are not. Quite temporarily, you
understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Hullo, what's this?"</p>

<p>A line of taxis began to stream up the drive. It was the
vanguard of the army of French polishers and workmen.</p>

<p>"My, we must keep this bunch out for a bit! Mr. Smith, please
run and tell them to wait on the tennis court. Tell them we're not
quite ready for them. But in the meantime wait till I have got His
Excellency out of the way. I won't be two minutes."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>The bell began to ring, but Frederick waited discreetly for
three or four minutes; then he went out and faced a small crowd of
men with carpet bags, in the porch.</p>

<p>"I say, you fellows," he said, "the guv'nor's not quite ready
yet. He says will you hang round over by that tennis court.
Watkins, will you stay here and tell the others as they come
up?"</p>

<p>As he closed the door he heard the men lighting their pipes and
shuffling up. He turned. Mrs. Flaxtop was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"Come," she said.</p>

<p>He followed her upstairs. His Excellency&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;was seated on a packing case, fanning himself, and all
the rest were standing in respectful attitudes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flaxton took his arm and led him up to the group. Then,
bowing very low, she said: "Your Excellency, this is Antonio, the
son of Count Androssi."</p>

<p>One of the secretaries interpreted the introduction. His
Excellency bowed to Frederick. Frederick, who felt it his duty to
live up to his instructions, bowed low in response.</p>

<p>There was a whispered confabulation in Chinese, then the
interpreter said: "His Excellency would be glad to have an
assurance from Signor Antonio Androssi that he formally waives his
claim."</p>

<p>Mr. Flaxton turned and gripped Frederick's forearm, in the
meantime giving him a comprehensive glance.</p>

<p>"Of course he does. On the contrary, Signor Antonio is now my
daughter's fianc. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"His Excellency would be glad to have the assurance in
writing."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course!"</p>

<p>A sheet of foolscap was produced, and Mr. Flaxton wrote down the
following:</p>

<p>"I, Antonio Bruno Androssi, of Vallombrosa, do hereby formally
waive my claim to the hand of Rhoda Mallesta, and to all rights in
the island kingdom of Paray."</p>

<p>"Here you are, my son," said Mr. Flaxton, handing Frederick the
document and a fountain pen. Frederick balanced the paper on a
window sill and copied the name Antonio Bruno Androssi. Mr. Flaxton
and one of the Chinamen witnessed the signature, and it was handed
to His Excellency, who immediately concealed it in some mysterious
crevice in his apparel, bowed and spoke again.</p>

<p>"His Excellency wishes the two young people the joy of the
twenty-seven nights of the White Flamingo."</p>

<p>Frederick muttered "Thanks awfully," and bowed again. Then the
Chinese contingent took their departure.</p>

<p>As they were going out of the hall, Mrs. Flaxton whispered to
Frederick:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Smith, thank you so much! You've been splendid."</p>

<p>"That's all right, madam. Now what about these carpets?"</p>

<p>"Just two minutes."</p>

<p>By this time the park was beginning to assume the character of a
military dump. Motor vans were drawn up in line. Taxis were
standing two deep by the outside rails. Workmen were lying about in
luxurious attitudes among the flower beds. When the car with the
Chinamen had departed Frederick was instructed to call the men in
and impress them with the urgency of the work. Half an hour later
Mr. Binspit returned, The curtains of Lord Gastwych Saint James
happened to fit admirably. The house resounded with the blows of
hammers and the swish of brushes and the groan of heavy furniture
being carried hither and thither. A dozen men were de tailed for
each room. At first there seemed to be no disposition to hurry at
all. The sritish workman deeply resents any attempt at speeding
up.</p>

<p>The popular commentary was: "What's this blinking job all about,
anyway?"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Flaxton rushed round and announced that there would be
a bonus of sixty pounds to be divided among the twelve men whose
room was finished first.</p>

<p>This considerably accelerated matter By half past one the
carpets were laid, the taining was done, the curtains were up and
the furniture was being rushed in at dangerous speed.</p>

<p>Frederick James walked hither and thither, saying quietly:
"Righto! Steady! Steady!"</p>

<p>The Flaxton family went in their car to get lunch at a hotel in
Riehmond, and Mr. Binspit did the same. Frederick James was too
occupied to think about food.</p>

<p>"Steady! Steady! That's right! Room Seven!"</p>

<p>At five minutes to two four dark, foreign looking men appeared.
They pushed their way through the throng. Frederick again observed
that he was an object of someone else's keen interest. He was,
however, too preoccupied to pay the foreigners much attention.
Probably they were friends of Mr. Flaxton's.</p>

<p>After regarding him furtively they went off to a corner to
whisper together. Frederick James was extremely busy. He was
standing by the top of the staircase leading to the basement when
one of these men touched him on the shoulder and whispered: "It is
very, very important. Will you come down to the basement just for
one second?"</p>

<p>"Eh? What for?"</p>

<p>"Just for one second."</p>

<p>Frederick James looked annoyed, but he followed the man
downstairs. The basement was deserted. They had no instrutions to
supply anything for it. There waa series of rambling stone
corridors and kitchens and wash houses leading to a yard at the
back, where there were stables and garages and a kitchen
garden.</p>

<p>He followed the man for twenty yards or so down the corridor,
when suddenly some one sprang cut from behind a break in the wall
and gripped him from behind. A cloth saturated with some pungent
liquid was whipped across his face. He was gagged and pinioned. He
felt himself being carried, and he knew that he was losing
consciousness. The last thing he remembered was being on a
comfortable spring seat and hearing the sudden whir of a
self-starter in a car.</p>

<p>"They'll never get the job done without me," he thought, and
then he swam away into some dark void.</p>

<p>The next thing he was acutely aware of was that the spring seat
had become unaccountably hard. It was swaying slightly, too, not at
all the motion of a car. There was a gentle lapping sound quite
near his head. He could hear the rumble of voices, but he could not
hear what was said. Then a face appeared through a trapdoor above
him, an old, battered, gnarled face that might be flesh and blood
or might be beaten copper. The jaws were moving with the slow
circular movement of the tobacco chewer. One eye surveyed him; the
other seemed to be looking over the owner's shoulder.</p>

<p>The voice said: "Hullo, Dago. Parley Italiano, huh?"</p>

<p>Frederick James eagerly sucked in the draft of fresh air. Then
he called out: "I say, what's the game?"</p>

<p>The face above turned sideways, and addressed some unseen
person:</p>

<p>"The blighter's awake. He talks English."</p>

<p>Another face appeared, a younger one with a black beard and a
deep scar on the left jaw. It must have been a very small boat, and
it was apparently not moving.</p>

<p>Frederick James repeated: "What's the game, you chaps?"</p>

<p>The swivel-eyed man replied: "The game's all right, my lad.
We're waiting for the guv'nor's orders to get way on."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>The two faces continued chewing, and the black-bearded man
expectorated over the edge of the boat They were appar ently not
unfriendly, only somewhat callous and utterly bored with having to
hang about. The swivel-eyed man regarded him thoughtfully, then
withdrey. Then the head of the black-bearded man appeared.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" again asked Frederick.</p>

<p>The black-bearded man studied him for everal minutes, but said
nothing. He also withdrew, and Frederick heard them talking
together above.</p>

<p>"It's a bit thick," thought the junior furniture salesman. "One
has to do things to oblige a client, but&mdash;really!"</p>

<p>His arms and legs were pinioned, and the plank was very hard. He
had had nothing to eat or arink since breakfast, but what he felt
most in need of was information. As quietly as he could, he sat up
on his haunches, then rolled over and got to his knees. They had
left the hatch open, and he strained his neck at an uneomfortabie
angle trying to get his ear to the open without showing his
head.</p>

<p>At first he could not catch what was said; then he distinctly
heard Swivel-Eye say: "When you've been with the guy'nor as long as
I 'ave mate, you won't ask too many questions."</p>

<p>There was a sillence then the black bearded man remarked: "Well,
I'll bet yer a thousand quid to quaftern of unsweetened that the
bloke isn't a Dago at all."</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then the other answered: "All I can
say is, if 'e ain't there'll be the devil to pay when the guv'nor
turns up."</p>

<p>"What d' you think's the game this time?"</p>

<p>"I know nothin'. All I know is, we pick up the <i>Zephyr</i>
to-night after sundown, when she's cleared port, and we stow away
these barrels of what they call potash and what other folks call
dope, and we tumble the lot&mdash;including this guy&mdash;into the
hold, and then clear. Them was the guv'nor's instructions."</p>

<p>"Where's it for?"</p>

<p>"Cape Horn. Pacific route to some blinkin' little port in the
Malay Straits. They won't make it for two months&mdash;if
then."</p>

<p>A terrible temptation came over Frederick James to thrust his
head through the opening and exclaim: "Look here, that's a bit
thick! I ean't go out to the Malay Straits. I've got to meet the
missus at six o'clock at an A. B.C."</p>

<p>But he restrained himself. The need for caution and information
was very great. The biack-bearded man was laughing.</p>

<p>"The guy'nor won't half be pleased if he finds out in two
months' time that they've got the wrong guy. Lumme, what a game!
What's the back of it all, Pete?"</p>

<p>"Bizness!"</p>

<p>"Bizness! 'Ow d' you mean&mdash;bizness?"</p>

<p>"Bizness is at the back of most things. Look 'ere! 'Ere's a
guess. Mind you, I know nothin'; nothin' at all, see?"</p>

<p>"I ain't a blabber."</p>

<p>"Supposin' yer take two groups of what they call interests
grabbin' on the same claim. This potash-dope line, d'yer see? The
Androssis and the guv'nor on one side, and this 'ere American and
the Barocchis on the other. It's known that the big bug on the
whole scheme is this Chink&mdash;what's 'is name? Ah Seng Tse. He
'ands round the concessions and that. See? But 'e wants to keep a
grip on the place 'isself. This island where they make the
'eadquarters, you know&mdash;Paray, isn't it?</p>

<p>"The Androssis want to butt in, and the chance comes to work
this blitherin' son of a goat off on the woman who's practically
the queen of the island. See? But the young count is a bad boy.
'E's off somewhere chasing some fairy from a chorus. The American
sees 'is chance and cuts in. Blows the gaff on 'em all. Cuts
Androssi out, announces 'e's marryin' 'is daughter&mdash;anythin'
just to quieten the Chink, throw sand in 'is eyes. Cuts in with a
new claim for concessions. The Androssis are in Paris huntin' up
the son and heir. But someone gets wind of it. Some of his gang cop
the lad, smuggle 'im off, and there 'e is&mdash;bound for 'is
blinkin' island kingdom and 'is bloomin' princess. Mind yer, I know
nothin'; nothin' at all."</p>

<p>Frederick James thrust his head boldly through the opening and
said: "I say, you chaps, I've had no dinner. Is there any chance of
getting a cup of tea?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!"' remarked Swivel-Eye. Then he nodded and
said: "Certainly, My Lord. 'Orace, put the kettle on the lamp and
make 'Is Lordship a cup of tea."</p>

<p>To Frederick's surprise 'Orace did as he was bidden. The two
seamen grinned, and Swivel-Eye muttered: "You're a rum 'un, you
are. Better lie down and not show yer 'ead above deck. Yer never
know when the guv'nor's going to blow across."</p>

<p>"But, look here, can't you chaps let me go? It don't matter to
you, does it?"</p>

<p>"When you see the guv'nor you'll know why we can't let you go.
What do you say yer name is?"</p>

<p>"Frederick James Smith. I'm an assistant salesman to Messrs.
Bole &amp; Binspit."'</p>

<p>"Sounds familiar. Better keep yer yarn ready to tell the
guv'nor."</p>

<p>"Where are we?"</p>

<p>"We're lying up&mdash;waiting the guv'nor's orders."</p>

<p>It seemed hopeless to try to get any more information out of his
captors. He waited patiently. In a few minutes the man with the
black beard handed him down a cup of tea. His wrists were tied, but
his hands were sufficiently free to grip the cup.</p>

<p>When he had drunk it the black-bearded man actually handed him a
cigarette and lighted it, at the same time adding: "Mind you put
that out when the guv'nor comes. 'E don't like smoking in the
stateroom. Yer might spoil plush carpets."</p>

<p>Frederick thanked him and smoked in silence. Barely ten minutes
elapsed before there was a sound of oars rattling in rowlocks, and
the lapping increased in violence.</p>

<p>One of the men called down to him, "'E's coming. Pull yerself
together."</p>

<p>When the face of the guv'nor appeared above the hatch Frederick
instantly realized the force of Swivel-Eye's remark as to not
letting him go. It was an enormous, puffy face, with protruding
eyes, a square jaw and deep, malevolent eyes.</p>

<p>A voice said: "Sit up, please!"</p>

<p>Frederick James did as he was told. The other glanced at him,
and then his face changed color. The center of his face seemed to
go white and the outside rim of it scarlet, and then the voice rang
out. Frederick James had always contended that for foul language
and profanity the furnishing trade was not to be beaten; but in the
brief minute that followed he realized that his colleagues were
merely amateurs at the game. He had never heard such a rich,
fruitful and varied vocabulary. The anger was not expended on
Frederick himself, or even on the two seamen, but on some
unfortunate individual named Shale. The boat rocked with the
violence of his anger and elocution. He drew back and growled at
the others. Frederick reared himself up to listen. He heard
Swivel-Eye say something, and then the thunder of the guv'nor's
voice:</p>

<p>"I don't want him blabbing! Better cut his throat and throw him
in the river!"</p>

<p>The wretched victim was left guessing as to the outcome of this
command, as the three of them drew away to the stern of the boat
and whispered.</p>

<p>"It's a bit thick," thought Frederick.</p>

<p>The discussion seemed to go on for an eternity. At length the
face of the guv'nor appeared again, and an enormous hand came down
and gripped him by the hair.</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;you, you little boneheaded sewer rat! I'm
sending you back. But not a word of this&mdash;ever, see? Not
to&mdash;no one! It's no good your giving me your word of honor,
because that wouldn't cut any ice at all. But if ever it comes out
that you've blabbed a word I'll come for you from the ends of the
earth. I'll put my foot in the small of your back and break you
clean in half. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir. Thank you very much."</p>

<p>The guv'nor withdrew, and the black-bearded man came down and
released him. In less than five minutes he was in a dinghy being
rowed in the direction of a group of deserted buildings. The
black-bearded man rowed, and the guv'nor accompanied him. They
landed and walked through two long, empty warehouses. At the end of
the farther one was a yard, where they found a large car and a
chauffeur. Frederick was told to get inside, and the guv'nor spoke
to the chauffeur. To his relief he found that he was to go
unaccompanied.</p>

<p>Just as they were starting the guv'nor put his head in the door
and said: "You'll bear in mind what I said!"</p>

<p>And the expression on his face was a thing that Frederick James
would be likely to bear in mind all his life.</p>

<p>The car glided off and turned westward. The pace increased as
they reached the highroad. They passed through a busy, rather dirty
town, which Frederick guessed to be Gravesend. They were in the
outskirts of London in less than half an hour. It was exactly
twenty-five minutes to six when they pulled up at the corner of
Oxford Street. The chauffeur came round and opened the door.</p>

<p>"You get out here," he said.</p>

<p>Frederick did not require any encouragement. He hesitated
whether he ought to offer the chauffeur a tip, but decided that if
he did he could not give less than two shillings, and that
disbursement might make him short for the evening's entertainment,
so he nodded and said: "Good afternoon, sir. Thank you very
much."</p>

<p>He walked round the corner and entered the premises of Messrs.
Bole &amp; Binspit. Everything seemed to be going on as usual. He
walked through to Mr. Binspit's office and met that gentleman
coming out. He was apparently in a genial mood.</p>

<p>He exclaimed: "Hullo, Smith! Are you better?"</p>

<p>October 2,1920</p>

<p>"I'm all right, sir."</p>

<p>"Someone told me that you had fainted and had gone home in a
cab."</p>

<p>Frederick equivocated.</p>

<p>"I'm better now, sir."</p>

<p>"A queer affair, that Richmond job. We got it done practically
on time. Then the client didn't want it after all. It seems that
someone who was expected didn't turn up, or came too soon or
something. He settled up, though&mdash;every penny that we
claimed."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Good night. You had better get on that Tilgate job
to-morrow."</p>

<p>At five minutes past six Frederick found Gladys seated at their
usual table in the A. B. C. in the Strand.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm late," he said.</p>

<p>"It's all right. Been busy, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The usual thing&mdash;rush, rush, rush, all day. What
you going to have? Poached eggs or sausage?"</p>

<p>"Sausage, I think."</p>

<p>"Righto! Pot of tea for two and two sausages, please, miss."</p>

<p>They ate their high tea in silence, finishing up with jam and
buns.</p>

<p>"Milly called this afternoon," remarked Gladys. "She says Fanny
Stone&mdash;you know that red-haired girl you didn't like, used to
giggle&mdash;she's got engaged to a feller in the city with pots of
money."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>After a mature interval Frederick James indulged in further
commentary:</p>

<p>"It's a rum thing&mdash;money and business. A chap was saying
to-day business is at the back of all troubles, trying to get on
and that. The things people do for money! You'd be surprised! Look
at our line! I don't suppose anyone, 'cept p'raps a doctor, sees so
much of the inner life of the rich as we do in the furnishing
trade. The things we see! The way some of these rich folks go on!
You'd never believe it! Of course, I never ask questions. A
client's private business is none of mine. P'raps that's why I'm
getting on a bit. But it's rush, rush, rush, all the time."</p>

<p>Frederick paid the bill and they walked out.</p>

<p>"Why, only to-day, you'd never believe what I've had to do."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just been one big rush! And I&mdash;I've waived a
kingdom and refused the hand of a princess; got engaged to an
American millionaire's daughter; been kidnaped; was nearly sent to
China; was threatened with having my throat cut all in my spare
time, like. You'd never believe it!"</p>

<p>"No, I certainly shouldn't!" Gladys screwed up her eyes. "You're
a funny old thing! Why, look, Charlie Chaplin's on at that
one!"</p>

<p>"Charlie Chaplin!"' replied Frederick. "Oh, we get enough
Charlie Chaplin in our business. I'd rather see something romantic.
What about that one over there&mdash;Love&mdash;or a Kingdom?
featuring Pauline Passionella?"'</p>

<p>"All right, dear. Whichever you like."</p>

<p>As they walked toward the ticket office Frederick whispered:
"Love&mdash;or a Kingdom? What do you think?"</p>

<p>She gave his arm a gentle pressure and they passed through.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. The Room</h2>

<p>The Room was in Praxton Street, which is not very far from the
Euston Road. It was fifteen feet by ten feet six inches. It had a
door and a window. The window was covered by stiff lace curtains
with several tears in them, framed by red plush curtains, which, if
pulled together, failed to meet by nearly a yard. The furniture
consisted of a circular mahogany table, a Victorian sideboard with
mirrors inset in the panels above, a narrow-seated horse-hair chair
which had a tendency to shoot the occupant into the fireplace, two
other mahogany chairs with green velvet seats, a white enamelled
flower-stand supporting a puce-coloured earthenware pot in which a
dismal aspidistra struggled for existence. In the angle between the
door and the window was an iron frame supporting what proved to be
a bed by night and a dumping ground for odds and ends by day. The
wall was papered with a strange pattern of violet and pink flowers
leaping in irregular waves ceiling-wards. On the walls were many
framed oleographs, one of the Crucifixion, one of a small boy
holding a piece of sultana cake on a plate, and a large collie dog
regarding the cake with melancholy greed. There was a photograph of
somebody's husband with a square beard and a white stock, two
water-colours of some foreign country characterized by blue
mountains reflected in a lake, and a large print of the coronation
of King George. On the floor was a yellow and red carpet of
indeterminate pattern worn right through in all the most frequented
spots of the room. Around the gas chandelier a dozen or so flies
played their eternal game of touch.</p>

<p>Now this is a brief description of inanimate
objects&mdash;except for the flies. But we all know that even
inanimate objects&mdash;particularly a collection of inanimate
objects&mdash;have a soul. That is to say that they subtly affect
everyone on the spiritual plane. Perhaps it would be safer to say
that they have a message.</p>

<p>To James Wilbraham Waite, seated on the horsehair chair on a
bright July afternoon, they brought an abrupt message. He looked
around the room and he said to himself out aloud:</p>

<p>"This is simply hell!"</p>

<p>He had occupied this room in the lodging-house for seven years,
and it had taken all this time to breed in him the special kind of
intense loathing and hate which he felt at that moment. It was not
the quick hate of sudden anger. It was the slow combustible passion
of years of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The room seemed to
embody in itself all that he detested and yearned to avoid.</p>

<p>His father had been a small Essex farmer, and James Wilbraham
had spent his boyhood on the farm. Owing, however, to Mr. Waite
senior's Iack of concentration on the commercial side of the farm,
and his too great concentration on the good stuff served over the
bar of the "Dog and Destiny," he 'vent bankrupt and died soon
after. His wife had died many years before and James Wilbraham,
being an only son, found himself at the age of eighteen alone in
the world without even a mangel-wurzel to his name. He was a dreamy
boy, loving an open-air life. He had done fairly well at the
Grammar School. He had no head for mathematics, but excelled at
theoretical subjects, which brought him no credit or marks. When
his father died there was apparently nothing for him to do but
become a farm hand. One of the masters at the school, who had taken
an interest in him, did his best to dissuade him from this course.
His name was Mr. Flint, and he pointed out the hopeless future of
manual labour without capital. He emphasized the fact that James
had had quite a good education and that he was intelligent, and
that he had only to use his brains to make his way in the world.
For two years James fought against the good advice of his friend.
He worked for a local farmer, and he might be working for the same
farmer now but for the fact that he fell in love with a girl he had
seen walking about the streets of Pondersham. He never spoke to
her, but she stirred some profound note in his nature. It was less
the girl herself, perhaps, than the idea of Iove in the abstract.
She was what was known as a lady, inaccessible, remote, fragile as
a china vase. He began to regard his rough hands and coarse clothes
with misgiving. And then one day he went to the pictures with an
acquaintance and found himself suddenly projected into a world of
magnificent Life, spelt with a very large L, where gorgeous women
flashed in and out of priceless automobiles, and powdered flunkeys
ushered them into marvellous palaces. The contrast was too violent.
If ever he wanted to possess one of these splendid
creatures&mdash;well, he could never do so as a farm hand.</p>

<p>His ideas of farming had never been academic, to put it mildly.
He had inherited a great deal of his father's vagueness. During his
father's lifetime he had regarded the soil as a mysterious
substitute for a mother. It succoured him with the good things he
liked, and made few calls on his industry. He liked to ride over
it, and see the little green shoots budding. Then he would dream by
a pond, or idle the hours away with a dog and a ferret.</p>

<p>Consequently when he informed his employer one day, with a sigh,
that he had decided to give up farming, that gentleman accepted his
resignation 'v ith unblushing satisfaction. Through the influence
of Mr. Flint he got a situation as a clerk in a corn chandler's at
Pondersham. He earned seventeen and sixpence a week, and managed to
keep himself&mdash;in a state of chronic hunger.</p>

<p>He endured this life for over a year, when again through the
influence of Mr. Flint he considerably improved his position. For
he obtained a situation at a scholastic employment agency in London
at a salary of thirty shillings a week. It was then that he made
his first introduction to the Room. He paid twelve shillings and
sixpence a week for it, and that included a breakfast, consisting
of tea and a boiled egg. To record his career during the seven
years that led up to this particular July afternoon would be
tedious in the extreme. It seemed to centre entirely around the
Room. By half-crowns and five shillings his salary had now risen to
three pounds five shillings. During the next seven years by similar
processes it might conceivably rise to five pounds. He would then
be thirty-five. But it was not these material considerations and
prospects alone which disturbed him. It was that eternal sense of
ingrained discontent.</p>

<p>He detested his work. At his desk he was always dreaming. He
dreamt of far-off countries, and beauty, and love, and romance. He
joined a local library and spent most of his evenings alone
reading. And when he had been completely transported into another
world he would look up and find himself in the Room. He would catch
his own reflection in the crazy mirrors, the boy and sultana cake
and the collie dog would appear to be grinning at him insipidly
from the wall, the vision of King George in his coronation robes
only produced in him a sense of acrid disloyalty. The wallpaper
leaping towards the ceiling made him want to scream. Even when he
turned out the gas and went to bed he was intensely conscious of
enveloping ugliness.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon his venom focussed on the flies
around the chandelier. He had come home early&mdash;it was a slack
time at the office&mdash;and he was reading a novel with a setting
in the desert. He became absorbed with visions. He saw the sleepy
pile of grey and white buildings against the vivid green of
date-palms in an oasis. He could hear the distant sounds of strange
music, and breathe the rich perfumes of the African night. Then
suddenly he looked up and saw those London flies playing their
ridiculous game beneath the chandelier. He felt maddened. He put
down the book and made a swipe at them with his handkerchief. They
dispersed only to re-form a few seconds later. He hit at them again
and again without any tangible result. Then he sat down and
thought.</p>

<p>"I want a holiday," he said to himself. "My nerves are in a
rotten state." Owing to the exigencies of office work he had had
his fortnight's holiday in April. He would not get another
until&mdash;some time next year. And then he would probably go to
Hastings, or Bognor, or worse. It was awful, unendurable.</p>

<p>"I won't have you here," he suddenly said to the flies. There
was a look of grim determination on his face. He picked up a towel
and slightly damped it, and began a fresh campaign. He soon
realized that to hit them in the air was a chance in a hundred. You
have to wait till they settle. He tracked them about the room. He
killed several on the table, quite a lot on the wall and the
window, but nothing seemed to make any difference to the party
under the chandelier. He made wild swipes at them and actually hit
several on the wing, but back they came. This persistence was
either astonishing pluck or astonishing stupidity. It was almost
uncanny. He struck wildly at one on the chandelier itself, and
then&mdash;crash! down came the globe and smashed on the floor. A
few minutes later he heard the ponderous steps of his rheumaticky
landlady coming up the stairs. He gripped the towel hard. He felt
uncertain of himself. "If the old fool makes a fuss about that
globe I'll give her a swipe," his mind registered. There was the
familiar tap on the door and it opened.</p>

<p>To his surprise she held out a letter. She had not apparently
heard the globe smash, neither did she notice it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bean's just left this," she said. "It came this morning,
but it was addressed to seventy-five."</p>

<p>He took the letter, and said "Thanks;" then, feeling that his
passions were somewhat vented, he pointed to the globe and said
casually:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I broke the globe, hitting at a fly."</p>

<p>She said: "Oh, dear! H'm! I'll go and get a dustpan and brush.
My legs are that bad."</p>

<p>"I'll get it for you if you like," he answered, feeling suddenly
quite amiable.</p>

<p>"I wish you would, Mr. Waite; it's under the kitchen
dresser."</p>

<p>The business of getting the dustpan and brush, clearing up the
broken glass, and listening to a story about the shocking pain Mr.
Bean was suffering with his kidney trouble occupied ten minutes.
She went at last and he opened the letter. It was from a firm of
lawyers in Liverpool informing him that an uncle of his had
recently died in Canada, and under the terms of the will he was the
inheritor of approximately six hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Six hundred pounds! For the first time he stared at the Room
with unseeing eyes. It had no horrors for him. He saw right through
the mahogany sideboard and the leaping wallpaper out into the great
broad spaces of the world. Gulls screamed above the heaving decks
of a mighty ship. He saw white cities with minarets and mosques
glittering in the sun. There were valleys aglow with myriad
flowers. A woman was coming towards him&mdash;</p>

<p>The desire to talk to someone about his amazing news was
irresistible. He knew no one in the house except the landlady. He
went downstairs and found her ironing some flannel underclothing in
the kitchen. He said:</p>

<p>"I say, Mrs. Beldam, I've come in for some money." The landlady
looked up at him with an expression of greedy interest. She
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nice, I must say. How much is it?"</p>

<p>"About six hundred pounds."</p>

<p>She looked down at her flannel petticoat. She was cautiously
balancing the potentialities of the situation. She couldn't exactly
see how she was to come in over this. All it would amount to would
be that she would probably lose a lodger. She repeated:</p>

<p>"That's nice." Then, after blowing on her iron, she added:</p>

<p>"You take my advice, young man, and put it all in War Savings
Certificates."</p>

<p>"War Savings Certificates!"</p>

<p>He looked at her with horror. Ah! he could see through it all.
This social conspiracy to keep him in the Room. Here was the golden
key to freedom, and this woman, this state, social life itself,
talked to him about War Savings Certificates. Not likely! He barked
at her:</p>

<p>"We shall see," and almost ran out of the room.</p>

<p>It was nearly a month before he got his cheque. In the meantime
he had been carefully maturing his plans. He bought maps, and
guides, and works of reference. He gave the scholastic agency a
week's notice, and when he was free he devoted his time to reading
and polishing up his French, at which he had been fairly proficient
at school.</p>

<p>The Room, if anything, seemed more hideous than before. He felt
himself already superior to it; nevertheless, he was still a little
frightened. It had for so long dominated him, with its drab menace,
he could not believe that he would ever really escape from its
clutches. He dreamed of some feral vengeance. Perhaps on the last
night he would get busy with an axe or a poker. But no, this would
be very foolish. He would be made to pay, and so the Room would
score off him.</p>

<p>And so one day in early September he gave up the key of the Room
to the landlady and left it for ever.</p>

<p>He had about fifty pounds in cash on him. With the rest of the
money he had bought a World-wide Letter of Credit. What destiny had
in store for him when the money was spent he neither knew nor
cared. He was achieving his supreme ambition&mdash;to escape.</p>

<p>Four days later he arrived at Algiers, tired, bewildered, but
very excited. He regarded Algiers as a good kicking-off place for
his adventures. He wanted to get to the desert, but, knowing
nothing of the country, he didn't know how to proceed. He stayed
there for a week in a quiet hotel, wandering about, and getting
lost in the maze of the Arab quarter. The city repelled him a
little with its large hotels and terraces of French villas. Even
the Arab quarter had a sense of unreality. He felt every moment
that he might step out and find himself in the Earl's Court Road.
One day at lunch he got into conversation with a Frenchman, who
told him about a journey he was about to take to Laghouat in the
south. James Wilbraham pricked up his ears. The Frenchman, it
appeared, was a traveller in rugs and bric--brac. He was making
the journey with a companion, and they were going by car. Yes,
there were only the three of them, including the chauffeur, and if
James cared to join them and pay his share&mdash;the contract was
concluded then and there.</p>

<p>Three days later the party left. They motored the whole of the
first day through the richly fertile country of Northern Algeria,
and spent the night at Boghari up in the hills. The two Frenchmen
talked the whole time, and James gathered about one-third of their
conversation, which was mostly about women, the rate of exchange,
French politics, and trade. At Boghari it was very cold and
overcast.</p>

<p>The seeker after romance began to feel depressed that night. It
was all very beautiful, of course, but somehow things were not for
the moment shaping in the way he had hoped. A motor-car was an
unromantic way of travelling, and French commercial travellers can
be very boring. He felt a tripper, an alien. He wondered whether he
would ever fit into any <i>milieu</i> in which he found himself. In
the early morning he dreamt he was back in the Room, and the
chairs, and tables, and lace curtains were laughing at him.</p>

<p>The next day, however, the car wound its way down into the plain
below, and they began to approach the desert. By midday it was very
hot. They lunched at Djerfa on fish soup, bustard stewed in oil,
and Algerian wine. The food nauseated James, but the Frenchmen
became more and more garrulous. He wanted to get on to where
romance would begin. At last they started, and all the afternoon
the car raced on down a straight road through endless tracks of
sand dotted with scrub, clumps of coarse grass, and occasionally
pistacia-trees. It was nearly sundown before they reached the oasis
of Laghouat. They drove up to the little hotel just outside the
wall of the town.</p>

<p>Having washed and changed his clothes, James felt a great desire
to escape from the two Frenchmen. He put on his hat and hurried
out. Immediately outside the hotel he was surrounded by swarms of
Arab boys jabbering in French. He tried to shoo them off, but four
of them followed him everywhere he went. He learnt afterwards to
become accustomed to this attention, but at the moment it annoyed
him. He wanted to be alone. He crossed the road and climbed up a
rocky eminence, followed by his retinue. Clambering over the last
boulder he gave a gasp of astonishment. Laghouat is two thousand
feet above sea level, and from it the desert slopes gradually down.
At first glance it gave him the impression of the sea, an endless
quivering ocean glistening in the sun. In the foreground were
thousands of stately date-palms, while on his right the little
town, dominated by its minaret, was a pleasant jumble of
salmon-pink, grey, white, and brown. For the first time since he
left the Room he thrilled with a sense of satiety. He sat there for
a long while dreaming. The boys chattered to him and among
themselves, but he was hardly conscious of them. The sun tipped the
horizon, and suddenly he heard a gun fired, a flag fluttered from
the top of the minaret, and a diminutive figure in black appeared.
Against the clear blue sky, graduated to pale orange on the
horizon, the minaret stood out like a pillar of gold. A rich
bell-like voice rang out and seemed to reach the furthermost places
in the desert. It was the muezzin calling the faithful to
prayer.</p>

<p>James Wilbraham gave a sigh of content.</p>

<p>"I have found it," he thought to himself.</p>

<p>That night he slept badly. He was troubled by the problem of how
to keep what he had found. How could he fit into this atmosphere?
How could he live? He was at present a foreign guest staying at the
only hotel. The town was entirely Arab, its activities almost
entirely devoted to the breeding of sheep and cattle. For days he
wandered about, listening for signs and portents. The French
travellers returned to Algiers. A few other trippers came and went.
A week went by. And then one day he met his fate in the person of
Giles Duxberry. He was seated on the verandah of the hotel one
evening when a tall, angular figure, in a white burnous, came
slouching up the path. He seemed to know his way about the hotel,
for he made straight for the bell, rang it, and ordered an
anisette. Then he retired, washed himself, came back and sat at a
table next to James. He poured water into the colourless liquid,
drank it in two gulps, and ordered another. When he had consumed
four of these insidious drinks, he suddenly said:</p>

<p>"English, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said James, with surprise.</p>

<p>"Have a drink?"</p>

<p>It would have been inhuman to refuse, and James also had an
anisette. He had never drunk it before, and his single one had a
much more potent effect on him than the four did on his chance
acquaintance. He tried to be conversational, but it was very
difficult. Mr. Duxberry's skin was almost the colour of an Arab's,
but his eyes were tired, his manners lethargic. He was like a man
utterly bored with every human experience&mdash;except perhaps
drink. He barked in monosyllables, and explained things in little
disconnected sentences.</p>

<p>He was, it appeared, employed by a Lancashire firm in the halfa
business. It seemed that some genius had discovered that the long,
coarse halfa-grass, which grew in the desert, was excellent
material for making paper. It was garnered by the natives, and
deposited in bundles in various depts about the country. Giles
Duxberry was in charge of a dept in a tiny oasis fifteen miles
away. He lived there by himself, and the only thing he could find
in the job's favour was that once a week he could come into
Laghouat and get drunk. He proceeded to get drunk on this occasion,
and before the evening was far advanced he was quite
incoherent.</p>

<p>Before he had reached this stage, however, he had asked James to
come out and see him, and explained where it was. The only way of
getting there was on horseback. James felt grateful for his early
years spent on a farm. He could ride. The expedition, moreover,
carried with it an element of adventure. Perhaps he, too, could get
a similar situation.</p>

<p>It took him three days to obtain the loan of a horse, which he
eventually did through the intermediary of four people. He felt
singularly like a paladin setting out on some holy quest as he left
the town behind and cantered across the desert. He had no
difficulty in finding his destination. It was a small oasis with
the inevitable date-palms, barley, and castor-oil plants, a low,
rambling, lime-washed building made of mud and cement, and some
half-dozen nomad tents pitched in the sand. He found Duxberry just
sitting down to lunch. Without any particular show of warmth the
latter said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, you've come then!"</p>

<p>He shouted something in Arabic into the room beyond. The room
was plainly but comfortably furnished, and very clean. They had
lunch, and were waited on by an incredibly ugly old Ouled Nail
woman, with the tattoo mark on her forehead and henna stains on her
finger-tips. The food was excellently cooked. James talked and
asked questions, and received monosyllabic grunts in reply.
Afterwards they sat outside in the sun and smoked. During the
afternoon Arabs kept on arriving with donkeys laden with bundles of
halfa-grass. Duxberry checked their operations with idle
indifference. There was an amazing sense of peace and space. In an
idle moment James thought of the awful Room. What a contrast! He
felt envious of this hard-bitten, sunburnt manager. Before he left
he put out a feeler. He asked his host whether he knew if there
were any more jobs like that going.</p>

<p>Duxberry stared at him.</p>

<p>"What for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>He seemed unable to understand.</p>

<p>"But you've got your fare back to England, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'd rather live here."</p>

<p>"Rather live out in this God-forsaken place than in
England!"</p>

<p>"Much."</p>

<p>"What is there to it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's just the sense of&mdash;oh, freedom and
space, and sun and air."</p>

<p>The older man regarded him gravely.</p>

<p>"Listen, son," he said; "when you've had as much of it as I have
you'll cut all that stuff out. I ran away from home when I was a
boy and worked my passage to South Africa. For thirty years I've
beach-combed all over the earth. I've only one ambition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"To get back home."</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>They looked at each other uncomprehendingly, like men who have
reached a mental impasse.</p>

<p>James Wilbraham left soon after and returned to Laghouat. For
days he wandered around the desert or sat in the hotel, pondering
over the problem of his own life. Certain realizations became clear
to him. He was unhappy. He wanted to stay out there. Giles Duxberry
was unhappy. He wanted to go back to England. Well, surely the
situation could be adjusted. Let Giles go back to the Room, and see
how he liked it. Let James take his place.</p>

<p>A few days later Giles arrived for his weekly "drunk." James
waited until he had had his fifth anisette, then he said:</p>

<p>"I say, Duxberry, I'd like to make a proposition to you."</p>

<p>"Carry on, son."</p>

<p>"Could you manage to wangle it so that I could take on your job?
If you could I would be pleased to give you a hundred pounds to pay
your fare back to England."</p>

<p>The beachcomber's eyes distended. He took a deep draught of the
milk-coloured liquid.</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds!" he exclaimed. His eyes said: "Well, of all
the blanketty, blanketty&mdash;idiots!"</p>

<p>They discussed ways and means. Two days later James again rode
out to see his friend. Yes, it was decided that it might be
wangled. Correspondence passed, resulting in James having to make a
trip to Algiers to interview a gentlernan who was born in
Blackburn. The arrangement was satisfactorily made. He returned to
Laghouat full of the joy of life. He spent a week with Giles
Duxberry, learing the small technicalities of his undertaking. He
began to pick up Arabic words and expressions. And then one day he
handed over a hundred good English pounds, and Duxberry counted the
notes carefully, pouched them, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!" he said.</p>

<p>James felt strangely moved. He could hardly speak. It was not
that he had developed any particular affection for his new friend,
but that he felt him to be a poignant figure in his destiny. He
said:</p>

<p>"Good luck to <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>Nothing more was said. Duxberry mounted his horse, waved a
perfunctory farewell, and rode away. James stood there bare-headed,
breathing in the warm air, and absorbing the marvellous sense of
repose of the desert.</p>

<hr>

<p>And so one day Giles Duxberry found himself seated in a
horse-hair chair that had a tendency to shoot the occupant into the
fireplace. He had removed his boots, and was gazing into the fire.
Then he looked round and regarded the Room. There was a lovely
curly sideboard with mirrors, which reflected the vision of his
sunburnt face, a white stand with a pot and a plant, a circular
table, two other chairs, a bed. On the wall a pretty pattern and
some enchanting pictures&mdash;a sacred subject, a boy and a collie
dog and a piece of cake, some clever water-colour paintings, King
George in his magnificent coronation robes. Civilization!</p>

<p>It was a dream come true&mdash;a dream of thirty years. He
sighed with happy contentment. He had eighty pounds in cash on him.
He had only to stroll out and there were a dozen saloons within a
mile, where he could order any drink he liked. There were cinemas
and music-halls. There was life passing all the time, strange and
amazing things that might happen any moment. He might get a good
job, make money, marry some beautiful woman. He gazed fascinated by
the Room and murmured:</p>

<p>"Gosh! this is heaven!"</p>

<p>As a man accustomed to live in lonely places he had acquired a
habit of talking to himself. He addressed the fire:</p>

<p>"Jeminy! What a fool! what a lunatic! That guy will soon get fed
up with it. He'll come bundling back. Anyway, he's not going to
take my Room from me. It was a square deal."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. Not Done</h2>

<p>His name was Priest, Albert Hector Priest. When he came to
Tibbelsford, the inhabitants regarded him as a foreigner. It took
some time to convince them that, as a matter of fact, he had been
born and bred in the town. His father had been a corn-chandler in
Market Square, and he himself was educated at Tibbelsford Grammar
School. At the age of seventeen, both his parents having died, an
uncle paid his passage out to Canada and gave him twenty pounds to
start him on a career. He was a smart boy, quick at figures, and
with a natural grasp for mechanics, and he got on. He became in
turn trolley-car conductor, clerk, bar-tender, showman,
professional cyclist, dealer in real estate, soft goods salesman,
manufacturers' agent, sub-editor of <i>The Wool Trade Journal</i>,
and his activities carried him all over Canada, California, and the
Middle West. Then in the end he invented the celebrated "Priest
trouser-stretcher" and made a small fortune.</p>

<p>"The Priest trouser-stretcher" was a most ingenious white-metal
contraption, and it was advertised in numerous newspapcrs under a
headline which said:&mdash; "Do not part with your pants. If they
trouble you go to PRIEST and confess"</p>

<p>And below came a sub-headling:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As pants the hart for cooling streams, so does PRIEST pant for
yours."</p>

<p>So you see that in addition to his other abilities Albert Hector
had a distinct literary flair.</p>

<p>Anyway, at the age of forty-one, so successful had the
trouser-stretchers become that Priest sold out his interests, took
his wife and two sons for a trip round the world, and came to
Tibbelsford with the idea of settling down in the place of his
birth. He took a modern Georgian house in the west end of the town,
and fitted it up with central heating, electric light, an enormous
number of bathrooms, lifts, and endless labour-saving devices. It
was fashioned rather on the lines of "The Ideal Home." The vicar,
who had only one bathroom in the rectory&mdash;and in that you
could never get any hot water&mdash;regarded the place with
suspicion.</p>

<p>It was not until the trouser-stretch magnate had contributed a
useful cheque to church funds that he was forgiven for his lack of
conformity.</p>

<p>So obsessed was Albert Hector with the designing and arranging
of his ideal home that it was some months before he had time to pay
much attention to the town itself. Most of the associates of his
youth had vanished, but apart from that, when he had time to look
round, he could not but be impressed by the fact that the town had
not changed at all. It struck him as amazing that in twenty-four
years anything could remain so stationary.</p>

<p>There was old Mr. Selden Wright with his huge public-house, "The
Love-a-Duck," still dominating the town. All public meetings were
still held in his old-fashioned ball-room. The school that he had
attended remained untouched. The High Street was exactly the same.
There were a few new shops, and a few fronts had been refaced.</p>

<p>A little way out two or three dozen new red-brick villas had
been put up, and one or two motor garages. But that was all. It was
not only that there had been little structural change, but mentally
the place remained the same. "Good God! they're stagnant," he
thought. People were going about doing identically the same things,
thinking the same things, that they did a quarter of a century ago.
They hadn't moved with the times. They knew nothing about modern
life.</p>

<p>Returning home one evening after a visit to George Splutter, the
barber&mdash;where he found to his astonishment that he could not
get his boots shined whilst he was being shaved&mdash;he said
tensely to his wife:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maisie, this little burg needs pep, zip, and vim."</p>

<p>And from that moment Albert Hector made up his mind that it was
his mission in life to put "pep, zip, and vim" into Tibbelsford.
But how to go to work? He discussed the matter at great length with
his eldest son, James, who was studying to be an architect and
surveyor. The other boy had gone back to Canada. "This place fair
beats me," said Priest senior. "There's no git-up-and-git about it.
Think of it: a town of this size and there's no social vitality at
all. There are just its pubs, and churches, and shops, and market,
and old-fashioned houses without any modern conveniences. The folks
just go backwards and forwards to their work without any ambition
or vision. They've got no kick. They don't know anything. They do
the same old things they did when I was a boy&mdash;the church
bazaar, the flower-show, mothers' meetings, Salvation Army, Girls'
Friendly, the stock-breeders' union, and so on. Why, Gosh! there
are only two picture-houses in the whole town, and no theatre or
decent lecture-hall. I tell you it wants vision. It wants
soul."</p>

<p>And James, who was a dutiful son, and dependent upon his father
for pocket-money, said: "Dad, you've said a mouthful."</p>

<p>"As far as I can find out," continued Mr. Priest, "there tre not
even any Masons&mdash;no lodges, no Elks, no Buffaloes, no
Flamingoes, nothing."</p>

<p>"Dad, you've hit it as usual," said the young man. "There's the
idea. Why don't you found a lodge and get a move on the social
spirit of the community?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Priest here joined in the discussion. She was a Canadian
woman, of Scotch Presbyterian ancestry. She was flat and thin and
she wore horn-rimmed spectacles. She pointed her index finger at
her husband and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's it, Bert. Uplift!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pries was secretly pleased that his wife and son should both
be intelligent enough to see that he was destined to be the man to
see this thing through, but he was not going to appear anxious. He
hummed and hawed, and talked of the great diffculties. And after
thinking over his project for three days he went and called on the
vicar, the Reverend Andrew Spiers. To him he endeavoured to explain
the idea. To his astonishment he found it extremely dificult to
drive into the reverend genileman's head the precise purport of his
mission. The parson's ascetic features gave the impression of
incredulity, faint amusement, doubt, bewilderment, and even
disapproval. When his visitor had finished, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;er&mdash;yes, Mr. Pricst, quayte so, quayte so. But it
appears to me that what you are aiming at is allowed for&mdash;and
indeed already arranged for&mdash;in our church organisations."</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't quite get me, sir," replied Albert Hector. "This
is not a religious organization."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Mr. Spiers.</p>

<p>"Well, because it's&mdash;it's&mdash;er&mdash;something else.
Everybody doesn't go to church. I want to get hold of the business
man, the good fellow. Get 'em together. Get 'em to pull
together."</p>

<p>"To what end, Mr. Priest?"</p>

<p>"For the good of the community."</p>

<p>"The church has that noble ambition."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;business men, you know what I mean. A lot of
good fellows get together and they help each other. You know, they
cut all the bunk out and come down to brass tacks. Push, go,
ambition. That's what this little town wants."</p>

<p>"But why do you come to me, Mr. Priest? Your project appears to
me to be more of a business than a religious conception."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with business and religion going hand in hand,
sir? Ain't I a good churchman? And my son and wife? Haven't I
supported your church?"</p>

<p>"You have been very kind, Mr. Priest, but I&mdash;I still don't
quayte see the precise significance of this idea of yours. I don't
think the parish of Tibbelsford is quayte the place."</p>

<p>He could get nothing more satisfactory out of the Rev. Andrew
Spiers, but they parted on friendly enough terms. One of the
secrets of his success in life lay in the fact that Albert Hector
was a born optimist. He refused to be discouraged by this interview
with the rector, or by the bewildered and sceptical attitude of
other citizens to whom he tried to explain his idea.</p>

<p>"You've got to allow that they're slow and dull-witted," he told
his son. "But when they get the hang of the idea, and see what a
boost it's going to give the town, they'll fall in quick
enough."</p>

<p>"Of course they will, dad," agreed James. "What we'll be wanting
will be a meeting-house. Now, what do you say to me getting out
plans for a swell lecture-hall? We could put it up in that vacant
lot just before you come to the cemetery."</p>

<p>It was not in the nature of Albert Hector to agree with any
suggestion of his son or wife direetly. He liked to talk about it
to such length that in the end he persuaded himself that the idea
emanated from himself. The idea of a lecture-hall or pubtic
meeting-house had indeed occurred to him, but not the idea that his
son should try his prentice hand on it. However, the boy was
getting on. It would be experience for him, and he would be able to
get professional advice gratis from the firm to whom he was
apprenticed. He eventually agreed.</p>

<p>But it was quite obvious that a move must be got on to the
formation of the Lodge before James's new building could come into
existence. A few weeks later every householder in the town received
this circular:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">TO THE BURGESSES OF TIBBELSFORD. HAIL AND WELL
MET!<br>
<br>
What is England in need of? Why is England lagging behind the
modern pushing countries of the world? Where is the pep that made
us the dominant power in the Victorian era? Have we discovered an
elixir of old age? Some panacea that keeps us just alive and NO
MORE? What we want is to get good fellows together and get a boost
on the social life of the community. We are stagnant. What we want
is Mov ment, impelled by ethical and Christian principles, the
square deal, mutual advancement in education and commerce. We've
got to give the leg-up, not the stand-by. We've got to drink the
strong waters of AMBITION. We've got to have vision, go, belief in
ourselves, hustle, COURAGE, co-operation, unity, and foresight.<br>
<br>
To this end will be formed immediately the noble order of the
BISONS. Temporary offices have been secured at 95, High Street.
They will be opened on Friday and Saturday next between the hours
of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Rell up in your hundreds and enrol!<br>
<br>
There is no fee, no charge of any kind.<br>
<br>
The novitiate will be enrolled in the ancient order of WOMBATS. And
by stages of proficiency and experience he will eventuate into the
order of EMUS, and finally to the most noble order of BISONS.<br>
<br>
(Signed by) the Grand Master of Bisons, ALBERT HECTOR PRIEST.</p>

<p>When, with a loud shout of Jaughter, the landlord showed this
circular to old Sam Spearhead, in the bar of the Love-a-Duck, that
same evening, the old man, who was rather short-sighted,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it? A circus?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," shouted the landlord. "Unless I'm much mistaken it's
going to be an exhibition of performing animals."</p>

<p>Needless to say the circular caused endless comment. Mrs.
Priest, happening to meet the rector's wife the next day,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of our project, Mrs. Spiers?"</p>

<p>"It isn't done," replied that lady, and moved away. And that was
that.</p>

<p>"What's the fellow's idea?" was the dominant topic.</p>

<p>Now the ironic part of the business was that, as a matter of
fact, Mr. Albert Hector Priest was quite sincere in his aims, and
no one would give him the credit for it. Opinion was divided into
three schools: one that argued that he was a religious fanatic,
another that he was just an ordinary fanatic, and the third that he
was some kind of swindler. The mere fact that there was no fee or
charge of any kind was suspicious. People in Tibbelsford were not
accustomed to do or get things for nothing.</p>

<p>Some of these opinions reached Mr. Priest, but he went calmly on
with his preparations. The offices in the High Street were fitted
out with chairs, tables, roll-top desks, files, account books,
works of reference, carpets, and curtains. James obtained two days'
leave from his duties in order to assist in a clerical capacity,
and two lady stenographers were engaged for the two days.</p>

<p><br>
When the Friday dawned, Mr. Priest and his son were up betimes, and
arrived at the office at eight-forty-five: The two lady
stenographers were there before nine and all was bustle and
excitement. The father and son both donned green cloaks trimmed
with brown fur, curious cockade hats, and round their necks were
many chains and orders.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Mr. Priest, "system! that's what we want.
System and organisation. These offices alone will be an inspiration
to these guys. Now, mind none of you forget what I've told you.
When the candidate enters, Miss Colegate, you ask him his name and
address, and write it down on the card. He then passes on to you,
Miss Withers. You take the card, ask him the questions which you've
got on the list, and enter the replies in the Order records. He
then passes into the inner office to James, who will instruct him
in the first principles. I shall be there too, in order that any
difficult point may be explained. Hurry up! Hurry up! I hear some
coming up the stairs already."</p>

<p>This was an auspicious start, for it was barely the stroke of
nine. The two men retired to the inner room and took up their
positions. There was a timid tap at the door and Miss Colegate
called out "Come in."</p>

<p>The door opened and seven very small and very grubby children
trailed in an stared about.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you children want?" said Miss Colegate.</p>

<p>"Please, miss," said one of the bigger girls, "we've come to see
the animals."</p>

<p>"Animals? What animals?"</p>

<p>"Father said you was going to show us some animals."'</p>

<p>When the two lady typists at last managed to convince the
children that there were no animals they set up a howl in chorus.
Priest and son came hurrying into the room, ani in the end Mr.
Priest had to give all the children a penny each to keep them quiet
and get them to go away.</p>

<p>After that the staff was undisturbed for over an hour. The
offices were above a chemist's shop, and they could constantly hear
the drunken clang of the shop bell.</p>

<p>Mr. Priest looked out of the window. There were the market
carts, the van from the Imperial Stores, errand-boys on bicycles,
coal carts, an itinerant knife-grinder, men with push-barrows
selling fruit and veegetables.</p>

<p>"All just as it was when I was a boy," he reflected. "They're an
immovable mass." Then he thought, brightly: "Well, it's for me to
be an irresistible force."</p>

<p>His reflections were disturbed by the sound of heavy footsteps
coming upstairs and a tap on the outer office door. Mr. Priest
peeped out and saw a likely, weil set-up young mechanic enter. He
was carrying a bag of tools. He heard Mr Colegate say, brightly:
"Well, sir? Have you come to&mdash;er&mdash;" and he heard the man
reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where the trap-door is miss? I've come to mend
the leak in the roof."</p>

<p>And for the whole of the two days the activities of the staff
were accompanied by banging and sawing on the roof above! A little
later a forlorn-looking middle-aged man turned up. He wanted to
sell a type-writer. It would be idle to record the full list of
visitors that the Bison Lodge entertained during the two days. It
is onl necessary to state that among others they consisted of seven
unemployed, who came to see if there was a chance of a job, three
tradespeople canvassing for orders, an inspector of police, a man
who wanted his account paid for a carpet, and about twenty morbid
people who came in to find out what it was all about.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the premises closed on Saturday night, Mr.
Priest had the satisfaction of knowing that he had enrolled eleven
Wombats. It cannot be said that they were ideal representatives of
the ancient borough. They were for the most part the rag-tag and
bobtail of the town, drawn thither by the attraction of the term
"good fellows." These good fellows reasoned it out in this
way:&mdash;</p>

<p>The term good fellow implied jollification. Jollification
suggested beer. Of course there might be beer and there might not
be beer, but beer was worth taking a sporting chance over. Anyway,
there was nothing to pay.</p>

<p>Except that they were a shabby lot, Mr. Priest had little chance
of judging the characters of his Wombats. He could not know, for
instance, that two of them had done time, that one was a village
idiot, and that four of them were such notorious loafers and
beer-swillers and wife-beaters that Mr. Selden Wright refused to
allow them in his bar.</p>

<p>"It is a beginning," he said. "When these fellows get the hang
of it they'll attract others."</p>

<p>He arranged for the first meeting of the Wombats two weeks ahead
in his own house. He might have arranged it sooner, only that the
intervening period had to be devoted to the designing and
manufacturing of robes, insignia, and rcgalia. Meanwhile the plans
and elevations of the lecture-hall had been passed, James had
incidentally arranged for a very satisfactory secret commission for
himself with a local builder, and the work proceeded with the
ponderous deliberation that was characteristic of the place.</p>

<p>Of the eleven enrolled Wombats only seven turned up on
the-night, but by active personal canvassing the Priests had
secured nine others, so that sixteen attended the inaugural
meeting. These included their own gardener and Mr. Cornice, the
builder who was erecting the hall. He was full of enthusiasm for
the noble order of Bisons. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Priest, this is a magnificent idea. There's no doubt that
this is just what the town wants. You are a public benefactor."</p>

<p>The Wombats found themselves committed to wear a curious black
cloak, trimmed with grey fur. The Priests were in green and brown.
The meeting was held in the drawing-room, and Mr. Priest, as grand
master, addressed the company for over an hour. He spoke
ecstatically about citizenship, good-fellowship, business, God,
patriotism, Masonry, the Colonies, agriculture, vision, the
building trade, trouser-stretchers, love, and ambition. The
newly-enrolled Wombats listened to him in patches. Their eyes were
inclined to wander furtively around the room. When this was all
over, would there be beer, or would there not be beer? The
unexpressed anxiety in every heart centred round that immortal
query: "To be or not to be?"</p>

<p>However, the speech ended at last, and Mr. Priest said,
briskly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, brothers, we will join my wife in the dining-room and have
some refreshments."</p>

<p>The Wombats tried not to show an indecent haste. They were not
yet out of the wood. What sort of refreshments?</p>

<p>On arriving in the dining-room they discovered that their worst
fears were well-founded. Mrs. Priest was dispensing tea, coffee,
thin sandwiches, cakes, and biscuits.</p>

<p>At a meeting held a week later the only Wombats who put in an
appearance were Mr. Cornice, the builder, a gentleman named Wiles,
who had done two years for burglary, a religious fanatic named
Muffle, and the village idiot.</p>

<p>The only member of the family who accepted this falling off with
equanimity was Mrs. Priest, who the morning after the previous
meeting missed some spoons, a silver jardinire, four brass pots,
an ormolu clock, a miniature set with diamond paste, a mackintosh
cape, and two umbrellas.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we haven't yet struck the right bunch," her husband
remarked, defensively. He refused to believe evil of his
fellow-man. There was some curious perverse streak in this
community. He couldn't understand it. He took old Frank Goolen, the
gardener, to task the morning after this disaster.</p>

<p>"Well, Frank, what did you think of our meeting?"</p>

<p>The old man pulled himself up and leant on his hoe. His clear
blue ingenuous eyes regarded his master with a certain diffidence.
He was obviously anxious not to be rude.</p>

<p>"Oo. I doan't know," he said. "I doan't take much stock by
un."</p>

<p>"How do you usually spend evenings, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Oo, well, I goes 'ome. I 'as a bite and a pow-wow with the
missus. P'r'aps I goes up to Love-a-Duck. I 'as a glass of ale,
maybe. I likes a glass of ale. I 'as a pow-wow with old Sam,
p'r'aps. We 'as one or two like. That's 'ow it goes."</p>

<p>Mr. Priest saw light. Ale! That's what it was. It was ale that
these men wanted and expected. How foolish of him not to have
sensed this before! It had never occurred to him. For the second
meeting he ordered in two dozen bottles of beer. If the original
company had attended, the meeting no doubt would have been a great
success. But there were only four, and at sight of these rows of
bottles the religious fanatic, Muffle, burst into a wild tirade. He
said alcohol was the invention of the devil. He had been deceived.
This was a house of sin, and so on. He left in a state of righteous
indignation, The village idiot had one glass and insisted on
singing "I am a pirate, bold and free." After he had sung it
thirteen times, he had to be led out. In the meantime Mr. Wiles had
quietly consumed seven bottles and Mr. Cornice three. Wiles got
very drunk and had also to be shown out, so that only the builder
was left.</p>

<p>Mr. Cornice was ina pleasant, complacent mood. He
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Priest, you leave this to me, I've lived in
Tibbelsford all my life. You've lived abroad and got out of touch
with the spirit of the place. Your idea's magnificent, and this is
very good beer. The trouble is you haven't got hold of the right
kind of citizen. Now I know them all, all the best ones. I suggest
that at the next meeting you get in a barrel of beer, and perhaps a
bottle of whisky for some of the elder men. I'll go round and get
hold of the real good fellows, as you call them, and then you
explain your project all over again."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, dad," said James, helping himself to his
third bottle of beer, "Mr. Cornice knows everyone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Priest was becoming a little peeved by the whole thing. She
ejaculated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me that the people around here are more interested
in downpour than in uplift."</p>

<p>The third meeting of the noble order of Bisons was an enormous
success. Forty-two jolly gentlemen of the agricultural and
shopkeeping class attended. Priest had the success of his life.
Every word he uttered was cheered to the echo. After the speech
they adjourned to the dining-room, and the barrel of beer was
tapped and the bottle of whisky opened, and tongues began to wag.
There was no doubt that Mr. Prist was a very good fellow, the kind
of man Tibbelsford had been waiting for for years. The town was
slow and old-fashioned. It wanted bucking up. Here was the very
man. Yes, thank you, I'll take anothcr glass. The bottle of whisky
seemed to vanish as soon as the cork was taken out, and Mr. Cornice
drew the attention of James to the fact, and James told his father.
Mr. Priest, flushed with his triumph, ordered three more bottles up
from the cellar.</p>

<p>By half-past eleven the barrel of beer ran dry, and six bottles
of whisky had been consumed. The noble order of Bisons was in full
working order. But the next day there was an unpleasant reaction.
It was brought about by Mrs. Priest. She was very angry. It was not
that things had been stolen. Nothing was missing except two more
umbrellas, a walking-stick, and a pair of field-glasses, but the
house was in a disgusting condition. It had been a wet night and
forty-two pairs of muddy boots had tramped all over the two best
carpets. Moreover, cigar and cigarette ends and tobacco ash were
scattered all over the floors. Beer and whisky had been spilt, and
the house reeked like a beer tavern. One of the servants had given
notice, and the cook was in bed with a mysterious bilious
attack.</p>

<p>"I won't have another meeting in my house," she said,
emphatically. "It's perfectly disgusting. If the English people
can't do anything without getting drunk, I should think we had
better go back to Canada. Besides, think of the expense."</p>

<p>Mr. Priest was also angry, angry with the Wombats, with himself,
and with his wife. He tried to explain that the meeting was only of
a tentative, experimental nature. They were feeling round to get
the right people. As for the drink, he certainly shouldn't supply
whisky like that again. One of the ideas of the Lodge was to
counter that kind of thing, to encourage Christianity and good
citizenship. There was no harm in a little beer. When the hall was
finished, and the wheat sifted from the chaff, he meant to make the
members pay a subscription, and they might run a small beer canteen
where they could buy their own drinks. There was no need for his
wife to get hysterical.</p>

<p>"Anyway," she snapped, finally, "you can just understand. I
won't have another meeting here."</p>

<p>This was an exceedingly disconcerting decision, as within the
next few days there were one hundred and thirty-seven applications
for membership!</p>

<p>Rumour is a peccant jade. Heaven only knows what she whispered
about. It is certain that Mrs. Spiers cut Mrs. Priest dead in the
High Street, and in the local paper the follawimg Saturday, under
the heading "THINGS WE SHOULD LIKE To KNOW," appeared this
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Whether the police are watching the activities of a certain
Colonial gentleman who has lately taken a house in the west end,
and where orgies are reputed to take place in the name of some
quack religion?</i>"</p>

<p>By which it will be seen that fate and the <i>Tibbelsford
Times</i> were very unkind to Mr. Priest, who had merely set out
with the laudable ambition of introducing "pep, zip, and vim" into
the town. He was, however, not yet beaten. If his wife would not
have the next meeting at home, it must be held elsewhere. He set
about searching for a suitable room. The parish school, he was
informed, was "not available for such purpose." The lecture-room in
connection with St. Mary's Church was quite out of the question, as
they were no longer on speaking terms with the Spierses. There was
a fairly large room connected with the Baptist chapel, but it was
so unlikely that the pastor would agree to let it that he did not
even approach him. There were no other rooms of any size except in
a few large private houses, and none of their owners seemei anxious
to accommodate him.</p>

<p>What was he to do? He had already enrolled his Wombats. The
movement was just beginning to catch on. If he waited till the
lectture-hall was finished, interest would have waned. It would be
a confession of failure.</p>

<p>There remained only one solution&mdash;the ball-room at the
Love-a-Duck. He had not wanted to go there, as the place was
essentially a pub. He was, moreover, a littk dubious about Mr.
Selden Wright, the proprietor, whom he had never met, and who
scemed to exercise an undue influence on the town. He was evidently
a man of strong personality, although only a publican and probably
a drunkard. However, ther being no alternative, he was forced to
apply to him.</p>

<p>In due course the landlord replied. Yes, the room would be
available on such and such a date, and the terms would
be&mdash;well, they seemed rather excessive to Mr. Priest, but it
was Hobson's chcice.</p>

<p>And so the next meeting of the Bison Lodge took place at the
Love-a-Duck. It was crowded out. Mr. Priest had never addressed
such a meeting. There seeme to be a feeling of tense interest. The
speaker was so absorbed in his subject that he had no time to give
a thought as to whether the interest centred round what he was
saying, or whether it was more closely associated with what
arrangement he had made with the licensee. Were drinks to ke free,
or had they to buy them themselves? Mr. Priest was oblivious. He
waxed eloquently about good-fellowship, vision&mdash;well, you know
what he waxed about.</p>

<p>About half-way through the landlord came in and stood by the
door. He listened for about ten minutes; and then slipped quietly
out. A few minutes later there came a reverberating noise fromthe
bar. It was the landlord's laugh. It was an irresistable contagious
rocket of sound, that seemed to shake the rafters and to cause the
chandeliers to tremble. It made the audience trembl. It was like a
sardonic message conveying the fact that there was to be no free
beer, and that closing time was drawing near. They looked at cach
other apprehensively and those nearest the door began toc slip out.
The risk was too great. When the address was over, a third of the
audience had disappeared.</p>

<p>So consumed was he with his oratory that Mr. Priest hardly
noticed this. Directly it was over, Mr. Cornice and some of his
immediate pals came up and smothered him with congratulations.</p>

<p>"You've fairly got them now, sir," said, Mr. Cornice. "You'll
revolutionize the town."</p>

<p>"By Jove, sir, it was magnificent!" echoed Mr. Cornice's
cabinetmakers' foreman, who was wearing his Sunday clothes for the
occasion. Others buzzed around him, and Mr. Priest went home
feeling that he could tell his wife with triumph that it was much
more satisfactory having the meetings at the Love-a-Duck than at
home.</p>

<p>The triumph, however, was not of long duration. For at the next
meeting, although the great hostel itself seemed very crowded, very
few troubled to come into the meeting. James, who was acting as
secretary, had to read eut a long list of resignations among the
Wombats. During the meeting, moreover, there was a good deal of
hilarity, not only outside in the bars and corridors, but in the
room itself. Some of the cheers had a note of irony.</p>

<p>When it was over, Mr. Cornice said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We haven't quite got the right crowd yet. We must wait till the
lecture-hall is finished&mdash;get our own atmosphere like."</p>

<p>It was another two months before the lecture-hall was ready. In
the meantime Mr. Priest held a few private meetings and did a deal
of active canvassing on his own.</p>

<p>"I realise," he explained philosophically to his wife and son,
"that I have acquired something which they find difficult to get.
They, on the other hand, have a substratum of conservatism I have
forgotten. I didn't believe it still existed. You can change an
individual, but it's damn difficult to change a community. It isn't
only beer which is the pivot of their lives. There's a certain kind
of queer stickiness and faith in what's always been done being good
enough for 'em. It'll take a lot of shifting."</p>

<p><br>
The lecture-hall was a most refined structure in red brick and
stucco. It was panelled inside in beetroot-coloured mahogany with a
blue frieze. It had a com mittee-room, a reading-room, a
secretary's room, lavatories, and a bar. Now, concerning this bar
there was a good deal of trouble. Mr. Priest had decided that if
the Wombats demanded beer they should pay for it themselves. There
should be a lodge canteen. It was not till it was nearly completed
that Mr. Cornice remarked one day: "I suppose, sir, you have
applied for a licence?"</p>

<p>Mr. Priest hadn't. It didn't occur to him that there would be
any difficulty over that. He got his lawyer to work, and that
gentleman reported that application had to be made to the Town
Clerk, who would report the matter to the local licensing
magistrates, who, in the course of time, would refer to the
licensing committee, who at some remote date would decide that it
wes not desirable at that time to grant any further licences for
the sale of intoxicating liquor.</p>

<p>"Of course," Mr. Cornice pointed out, "there's nothing against
you as a proprictor supplying any drink you like, so long as it's
not charged for."</p>

<p>The whole attitude of the town seemed to be a conspiracy to
force him to supply beer to the inhabitants free. Beer seemed to be
the Open Sesame to every local activity. He couldn't understand it.
He was angry&mdash;damned if he would buy beer for these
bone-headed guys! He offered uplift and they demanded beer, and the
church and the schools and the civil authorities wouldn't help
him.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he said, "we'll start out with a swell do. We'll
make 'em sit up. There'll be only soft drinks, but we'll give 'em
such an entertainment as they've never had in this little burg
before. None of your cheap stuff, but a real elevating
evening."</p>

<p>The following week the whole town was placarded with flaming
posters:&mdash;</p>

</pre>

<p>The hall was constructed to hold four hundred and fifty people.
When the Grand Master got up to address the company there were
thirty-seven people present. Before the last item was reached there
werc fifty-eight, of whom four had paid. The audience seemed to
consist mostly of women and young children, who made a bee-line for
the cakes and lemonade directly it was over.</p>

<p>Mr. Priest knew then that the game was up. He was flogging a
dead horse. You couldn't drive git-up-and-git into a town which
regarded this rich fare so perfunctorily.</p>

<p>"The point is, dad," said James, when they got home, "I don't
believe Tibbelsford <i>wants</i> uplift."</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of wanting. It's a question of
understanding," said Mr. Priest, who didn't like anyone else, least
of all his family, to make conclusions. "One might just as well
expect hyaenas to understand double-entry."</p>

<p>He passed a restless and disturbed night.</p>

<p>In the morning he was strolling in the garden, admiring the rose
shoots. He saw Mr. Mildrew drive up in his little dog-cart, get
out, and walk briskly up the path to the tradesmen's entrance. Mr.
Mildrew was notoriously the best and most respectable grocer in the
town. He was a dapper little man with a neat black moustache. For
seventeen years he had been in the habit of driving round the
neighbourhood and calling on his customers for orders. His theory
was that he liked to come in touch with them personally, to find
out their exact requirements, and to avoid mistakes and
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>"Now, that's the kind of feller," reflected Mr. Priest. He went
up to him and called out: "Hi, Mildrew!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said the grocer.</p>

<p>"Now you're the kind of feller who knows things. You've heard
all about my move here, you know, the Bisons and that?"'</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Now, why, for one, didn't you come to my show last night?"</p>

<p>The grocer cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"There were a lot of things on in the town last night, sir."</p>

<p>"A lot of things on in the town! What kind of things?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, for one thing there was the football club general
meeting. There was the pig-breeders' dinner, a discussion at the
church school about the revision of the Prayer Book, the committee
meeting to discuss the presentation to Farmer Williams for saving
that boy's life in the Tibbel, the fly-fishers' smoking concert,
and several others."</p>

<p>"My! but&mdash;Gosh! where did all these things happen?"</p>

<p>"Some at the church schools, but mostly in the Love-a-Duck,
sir."</p>

<p>"And what were you at?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I had, of course, to go to the Masonic dinner. That was in
the ballroom at the Love-a-Duck."'</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The Masonic dinner."</p>

<p>"Masonic? I've lived here all this time and I've never heard
that there was such a thing as a Mason in the town."</p>

<p>"No, sir, one doesn't often hear about&mdash;the Masons. They
don't talk much."</p>

<p>"They don't! Why not? Is there anything to be ashamed of?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. It's just that we don't do it."</p>

<p>"But Golly! This beats me. Masons, eh? There am I a member of
the Flamingoes, the Elks, the Beavers&mdash;we're proud of our
lodges. We don't mind letting folks know."</p>

<p>"No, sir? Well, I suppose it's just a different way of looking
at things."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you got drunk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. Some of the gentlemen drank beer. There was no
case of exces I myself am a teetotaller."'</p>

<p>"And who belongs to the darn thing?"</p>

<p>"Most of the best people, if I may say so, sir. I am not, of
course, allowed to divulge namcs."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm jiggered!"</p>

<p>"By the way, sir, I called on Mr. Seldes Wright this morning. He
asked me to give you a message. He said that if at any tim you
wanted to let that lecture hall he is looking out for a garage, and
would be pleased to make you an offer."</p>

<p>Mr. Priest was furious.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the darned insolence! Listen, Mildrew! I came back
to this God-forsaken little town with the idea of helping,
boosting, getting a move on things. And nobody helps me, nobody
understands me, nobody believes in me. How do you account for
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. I suppose it's just a different way of doing
things. The peopl here like what they're used to.
Anyway&mdash;there it is."</p>

<p>He tapped his book, gazed reflectively at the large red house,
and then added, brightly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the way, sir, are there any orders for groceries this
morning?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. The Old Lady with the Two
Umbrellas</h2>

<p>Paris can be an exceedingly dull city. One has only to miss a
keenly anticipated appointment with a friend, to catch a cold in
the head, to be disappointed in some love affair, to realise that
the cold grey waters of the Seine are the only really inviting
thing about it. One is down in the depths. Certainly these moods
are apt to be transitory. One burst of sunshine, and lo! the cold
in the head is forgotten, the friend has been waiting all the time,
the girl may turn up. I forget which of these misfortunes had
assailed me, but I know that I was in a very bad humour, sitting
alone outside a little caf&eacute; in Etoile. Imagine my delight,
then, when who should amble along the boulevard, and proceed to
seek a table near me, but my old friend Tolozan. I had not seen him
since his retirement from the police intelligence department at
Bordeaux, upon a modest but well-merited pension. He held out his
hand to me and smiled in that courtly and engaging manner which was
characteristic of him. One of the secrets of his successful career
had been that manner of inspiring immediate confidence. One went on
from the point where one last left off, however long an interval
may have intervened. He forgot nothing. All one's own opinions and
affections appeared to be stored away carefully in his memory. The
humdrum details of my particular trouble on this occasion evoked
from him a profound concern. (Looking back on it I think it must
have been a girl; no cold in the head would have called forth such
charming sympathy).</p>

<p>My affairs dismissed, he told me that he was living at Colombes
with his wife and daughter. He had a small villa and an acre of
garden, which occupied most of his time. He spoke lovingly of his
roses and gentians, his runner beans and leeks, and vegetable
marrows. He hoped I would pay him a visit. He had come to Paris to
buy seeds.</p>

<p>I was vaguely amused at my friend's enthusiasm. I could not help
being impressed by the contrast of these placid interests compared
with the turbulent incidents of his career spent amongst criminals
and courtesans. At the same time, I could not help rejoicing that
the perils and dangers of his life were passed, and that he had now
reached this calm haven, where he could enjoy a full measure of
repose, and indulge in those pleasant philosophical recreations and
theories, which always attracted him so.</p>

<p>Moreover, I had been anxious to meet him ever since his
retirement. I felt convinced that stored away in the archives of
his memory must be many interesting facts and stories which the
etiquette of the service would have prevented him from divulging
while in harness. Over our coffee I boldly insinuated that this
might be the case. He smiled deprecatingly and shrugged his
shoulders. He was not one of those old chaps who like to hold youth
spellbound by a recapitulation of their remarkable deeds and
exploits. He was no Tartarin of Tarascon. It was indeed difficult
to get him to talk about himself in a subjective sense at all. If a
discussion arose, he would point some little theory with a leaf or
two taken from the record of his own experiences, but as for
telling a tale in the accepted sense, well, he simply couldn't see
the sense of it. I dug out of him the story of the Old Lady with
the Two Umbrellas. Being a writer, and therefore a person with an
elastic conscience, I have no hesitation in repeating it. But I'm
glad I am to do it in a foreign language and in a foreign country,
for I feel that Tolozan would not approve. He told me once that the
only fiction he had ever read was "Monte Cristo," and he thought it
a poor book, pointless and improbable. He used to study Comte,
Montaigne, and seed catalogues.</p>

<p>I should never have got these facts out of him at all, I
believe, if it had not happened to commence raining whilst we were
sitting outside the caf&eacute;. We were under an awning and the
procession of people passing by, holding up umbrellas, reminded him
of the salient fact, for he turned to me and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"What would you think of anyone who always carried two
umbrellas?"</p>

<p>The question was so surprising that I had nothing to reply. Two
umbrellas? He continued meditatively:</p>

<p>"I knew a woman who did this."</p>

<p>I begged him to enlighten me upon the details of this unusual
fact, and by many questionings and promptings I got the story out
of him.</p>

<p>It happened after he had left the service. It appears that for a
year after his retirement he and his wife and daughter continued to
live in Bordeaux. They only came to Paris ultimately because it was
decided that the daughter should attend the conservatoire of music.
On retiring, his portfolio and the cases he had in hand were given
over to a younger man, named Freycinet. He was a young man for the
position, and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and friend of Tolozan's. He
frequently visited the family at their flat in the Rue Judaique.
One evening towards the end of the summer&mdash;it was the summer
following the Armistice&mdash;Freycinet came to him in a great
state of consternation. He was obviously bewildered and distressed.
Tolozan took him into his little den and begged him to confide his
trouble.</p>

<p>"I'm likely to lose my position," he kept repeating.</p>

<p>"Well, old man, tell me all about it. Perhaps I can be of
service," said Tolozan.</p>

<p>"It's like this," spluttered Freycinet. "Two months ago we
received information from the prefecture that gold was leaking out
of the country over the Spanish border. I was sent down to Irun to
take charge of the matter. I did the usual thing, examined all
luggage, searched promiscuous people, arrested a few suspicious
characters, doubled the sentries at vital points on the border, but
nothing came of it. We could find no trace of the leaking gold. For
three weeks I was up night and day doing everything I could think.
Then a stern note came from headquarters. The gold was still going
through. Something more must be done. These Treasury people have
wonderfully sensitive ways of finding out. They believed it went
through to Bilbao; a steady stream of golden louis. I became more
drastic. For three days running I had every passenger on every
train thoroughly searched, all the luggage thoroughly sifted. I
even probed amongst the coal on the engines. I searched the guards
and porters and engine-drivers. The Government sent naval packets
to patrol the Bidassoa, a destroyer to watch off Hendaye, and two
others to cover the coast between there and Bordeaux. Not a boat
put out to sea without being searched. We never found a coin. A
fortnight later the prefect of the police sent for me. He was
furious. He said that he regretted to say that he held me
responsible. The Government were of opinion that the gold was going
through by land, and they were demanding a scapegoat. You see the
position I'm in, old man. That was only a week ago, and I've found
nothing."</p>

<p>Tolozan looked very grave. He pulled at his thin grey imperial
and muttered:</p>

<p>"Smuggling gold out of the country is a penal offence. A man or
woman who does that is a traitor to France."</p>

<p>He was very indignant. Tolozan had a criminal code of his own.
There were some crimes of which he was surprisingly tolerant. In
his opinion the worst crimes were the unpatriotic ones. He would
show no mercy to a traitor. Over this affair of Freycinet he wished
to make his position clear. He had retired, and he had no intention
of deliberately interfering. If he helped his old colleague with
his advice, he must understand that he only did so out of his
affection for him and for the safety of France. His name was not to
be made use of, neither would he take any active part. He would
merely observe, and if any illumination came to him he would pass
it on to Freycinet to act upon. He would accompany him to the
frontier, paying his own expenses.</p>

<p>Freycinet was naturally delighted at his friend's offer, and
thanked him profusely. On their way to the station he told him of
one unusual incident in the case.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said, "I have been on the lookout for suspicious
characters, and also for people who pass backwards and forwards
frequently. Several of the latter I have examined and
cross-examined, and gone to the trouble of certifying their
statements. For the most part, they are quite innocuous, little
traders, commercials, and genuine business people, but there is one
old woman who mystifies me. She goes into Spain about twice a week
and returns the next day. She always carries two umbrellas and no
other luggage at all. The second time she went through I had her
up. The woman officials searched her. I searched the umbrellas.
There was nothing, nothing at all. She is patently an old crank of
some sort. When I asked her why she carried two umbrellas she
replied that one was for fair weather and the other for foul. The
next time she gave some other reason, quite trivial and absurd. She
is quite a character. She attracts a lot of attention in the
Customs, talks loudly to everyone, cheeks the officers. They all
know her, and are rather amused. They say 'Hullo, here comes Madame
Fair and Foul!'"</p>

<p>"Have you followed up her case more closely?" asked Tolozan.</p>

<p>"No. As we know that she neither takes gold out of the country
nor brings anything in, it hardly seems worth while. She says her
name is Madame Ponsolle. She lives in Bayonne and goes across to
visit her sick daughter in San Sebastian. She stays the night with
the daughter and returns."</p>

<p>"Are the umbrellas always the same?"</p>

<p>"No, since you mention it, they are not. Sometimes she carries
an old blue one with a black-and-white handle; sometimes a black
one with a brown handle. I have not made a careful note, but it has
struck me that the umbrellas are not always the same. What were you
thinking?"</p>

<p>"They may be a sign. A message may be conveyed by such
means."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but, I don't see how a message could affect the
smuggling of gold."</p>

<p>"It might be worth while to follow her. If the umbrellas were
always the same, I agree we could dismiss her as a crank, but the
fact that they are different&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very good. I'll have her followed if she comes through
again."</p>

<p>The two friends arrived at Irun the same afternoon, and
Freycinet made arrangements to have all the passengers on the
evening express examined. None of his subordinates had anything to
report. The old lady with the two umbrellas had not been through
again. Tolozan took up his position on the platform, the figure of
an indolent, rather bored commercial traveller, with a leather
attach&eacute; case, and a small pile of Parisian newspapers tucked
under his arm. When the train came in, and the passengers were
turned out, and headed into the Custom House, he also drifted
thither. The noise was deafening&mdash;sleepy passengers grumbling
at the disturbance, porters struggling with bags and trunks,
everyone&mdash;including the inspectors&mdash;irritable and
peevish. Tolozan was pushed hither and thither. Suddenly above the
din he heard a shrill voice calling out:</p>

<p>"Oh, you devils! All this again, you miserable toads. As though
a lady of my irreproachable character can't carry an umbrella
without having all these magpies pecking at her. Ah, there he is!
There's a pretty apple-cheeked young man. Ren&eacute;! I'm sure his
name is Ren&eacute;. Come, come along. Hurry, little one. Much as
we love you, we can't spend the night here."</p>

<p>Tolozan heard one of the porters mutter: "There she is again.
There's old Madame Fair and Foul."</p>

<p>She was waving her umbrellas threateningly, the centre of an
astonished group. Even the disgruntled passengers could not
restrain a smile, and the officials shrugged their shoulders
helplessly. She was rather a tall woman with a black shawl round
her head and a shabby black frock. The shawl partly concealed her
face. A mop of white hair dangled down, almost covering her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Look at that extraordinary old woman," people were exclaiming.
"All her luggage seems to consist of two umbrellas."</p>

<p>While they were indulging in this reflection, an official came
in, and in an enormous voice bellowed out:</p>

<p>"All women to the right. All men to the left."</p>

<p>A search! Freycinet's work. Grumbles turned into curses,
irritation into violent abuse. Scandalous! What was the meaning of
it all? As though it wasn't bad enough to go through the Customs!
Where was liberty, equality, fraternity? What were these busybodies
thinking of? Sweating and groaning, the people poured into the
adjoining rooms and quickly forgot all about the old woman with the
umbrellas. Ten minutes later Tolozan drifted into a little office
where Freycinet sat in state. Various officials were bustling in
and out of the room.</p>

<p>"Well, old man?" he said, on observing Tolozan.</p>

<p>"I should like to examine the old lady's umbrellas."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the umbrellas were brought. There was nothing
about them to arouse the slightest suspicion except that one, with
a jade green handle, looked more expensive than the costume of the
old lady seemed to justify. The other was shabby enough, with a
handle of brown wood. Tolozan naturally examined the frames
carefully to see if there was any patent spring, or any possibility
of gold being secreted. But he quickly realised that such an
eventuality was quite out of the case. There was no spring, the
stems were much too thin, and the green one was made of steel.</p>

<p>"Would you like to question her?" said Freycinet.</p>

<p>"No," replied Tolozan. "Have you detailed anyone to follow
her?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"In that case it would amuse me to follow her myself, if you
have no objection."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I should be delighted, if you really
think&mdash;if you don't think it will be wasting your time."</p>

<p>"An idea occurred to me whilst I was watching the crowd in the
Custom House. I would rather not say anything about it. I may be on
the wrong track. But twenty-four hours' delay won't make such a
grave difference."</p>

<p>"Very good. The Spanish train leaves in a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Tolozan that he said very little about
his trip over the border. His attitude all through was that he was
a helper, not an actor, in this little drama. He wanted Freycinet
to find things out for himself. He was merely assisting,
suggesting. He did not return the next day. Indeed, he did not
return for over a week; but on the third day Freycinet received a
mysterious and cryptic message from him. It was scribbled across a
half sheet of notepaper like a formula from a school text, and was
initialled "T." It ran as follows:</p>

<p>"If one's attention is arrested by an old woman with two
umbrellas one is apt to overlook a young man with a
walking-stick."</p>

<p>Whatever did he mean? A young man with a walking-stick? Had
Tolozan seen or heard anything? Why didn't he return? Freycinet
continued his worrying tactics at the frontier town. He was
becoming unpopular among his subordinates, who were getting tired
of being nagged and sworn at by weary travellers. The old lady with
the two umbrellas had returned as usual the next day and gone back
to Bayonne.</p>

<p>"When he comes back I suppose I must keep my eyes skinned for a
young man with a walking-stick," thought Freycinet, who held his
old chief in almost reverential awe. Truly enough, the day after
receiving the message, Madame Ponsolle appeared again. Freycinet
followed her into the Custom House. There she was as garrulous and
noisy as ever. Freycinet glanced around. There was the same crowd
as usual&mdash;Basque peasants, clerks, shopkeepers, commercial
travellers, a few English and American tourists. A young man with a
walking-stick? Well, of course, there were several. Many of the men
were carrying walking-sticks. However, he felt bound to act upon
his friend's hint, so he went up to one young man who was standing
close behind the old lady, and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Will you please come with me," he said.</p>

<p>The young man looked scared, but followed him quickly enough. In
the office he said:</p>

<p>"Please show me your papers."</p>

<p>Maxim Quinson, aged 43, traveller in machine tools to Messrs.
Charbonel et Cie, engineers of Bordeaux, visiting firms in San
Sebastian, Bilbao. Yes, everything in order.</p>

<p>"Open your valise and remove your overcoat."</p>

<p>The young man did as he was ordered.</p>

<p>In the valise were a few catalogues and papers, clean linen,
boots, and night attire. Nothing of any consequence. Neither did
the contents of his clothing reveal anything more interesting.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous," thought Freycinet, "if I've got to arrest
every man who carries a walking-stick."</p>

<p>The little traveller was sent on his journey.</p>

<p>A few days later Tolozan returned.</p>

<p>"Has the old lady with the two umbrellas been through again?"
was the first question he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Freycinet. "But I should think she is about due.
Have you anything to report, Tolozan?"</p>

<p>Tolozan looked relieved, and slightly mysterious. He plucked at
his beard thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I would rather wait till after the evening train has been in
before I express any opinion. In the meantime, let us see whether
Madame Delarme can give us an omelette and a ragout. That Spanish
food always nauseates me." Tolozan was in gay humour over their
meal, and refused to discuss the affair of smuggled gold.</p>

<p>When the evening train came in, however, they both were on the
watch, and mingling with the crowd in the Custom House.</p>

<p>"As I thought," muttered Tolozan. The old lady with the two
umbrellas was as noisy and active as ever. Freycinet looked eagerly
to see if the young man with the walking-stick was accompanying
her. He was not. But, of course, there were other men with
walking-sticks struggling and gesticulating near the barrier.</p>

<p>"As I thought," again muttered Tolozan.</p>

<p>Freycinet glanced quickly at his friend. He was regarding a pale
middle-aged man standing behind the old lady.</p>

<p>"That's not the man who accompanied her the other day,"
whispered Freycinet.</p>

<p>"No? Does it occur to you that anything else is similar?"</p>

<p>"No-o, I can't say it does. Does it occur to you?"</p>

<p>"Only this&mdash;although it's not the same man, it's the same
walking-stick."</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Freycinet! Isn't it more important for the
Government to know where the gold comes from rather than where it
goes to? Think. As a matter of fact, I believe I know where it goes
to."</p>

<p>"You know where it goes to! You make me feel like a baby,
Tolozan. Do you mean to say that the gold is actually in that
stick? And I had it in my hands the other day!"</p>

<p>"I have every reason to believe that it is. But there is another
point. I doubt whether the man who is carrying it knows what he is
carrying. There's only one person in this crowd who knows and
that's the old woman with the two umbrellas&mdash;the decoy."</p>

<p>Freycinet braced himself up. He knew that his friend expected
him to act, that he was leaving it to him. He walked quickly out of
the Custom House. In a few minutes an official entered and
announced that everyone was to be searched again. He asked Tolozan
to accompany him to his little office. "I'm simply doing this so
that the old lady shan't know we have found out," he said to
Tolozan, with the glance of a terrier seeking approval from his
master. In a few minutes the man with the walking-stick was brought
in.</p>

<p>"Your papers, please, and then open your bag and remove your
coat," said Freycinet; and then casually: "What a very handsome
cane! Allow me!"</p>

<p>He took the cane and examined it. It certainly was handsome. It
was made of some very hard South American wood&mdash;possibly snake
wood. It had a silver knob and a broad silver band a few inches
from the top. It was uncommonly heavy. Freycinet gave the knob
several twists, but nothing happened. Then he tried the silver
band. At the third attempt it moved. Exerting great pressure, he
succeeded in making it revolve.</p>

<p>"I observe you carry a sword-stick, Monsieur Grimaux," he
remarked.</p>

<p>The man looked very agitated. He was standing in his
shirt-sleeves. He mumbled:</p>

<p>"It doesn't belong to me, inspector. I borrowed it."</p>

<p>"Ah! Someone is very trusting. What is all this?"</p>

<p>The top of the stick had come off. Freycinet was pouring out on
the deal office table a stream of gold louis pieces!</p>

<p>The expression on the man's face was a strange mixture of
amazement and fear. He burst into a sob.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it, inspector. I know nothing about
it."</p>

<p>"You know that smuggling gold over the frontier is a penal
offence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard so, monsieur, but I know nothing about it. I
didn't know the cane had gold concealed in it. Someone asked me to
bring it. I've a wife and three children, monsieur. I'm a poor man.
I've never done anything dishonest. I swear, inspector, I know
nothing about it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, pull yourself together. We want to get at the
truth. It will pay you to be quite candid. If you lie you will go
to prison. If you speak the exact truth, we may let you go. Tell us
exactly how you came by this."</p>

<p>The man was a poor specimen. His teeth were chattering. He
blurted out:</p>

<p>"They threatened to kill me if I blabbed."</p>

<p>"Go on. Tell us the exact story."</p>

<p>"I'm a traveller in hosiery," he stammered. "I bought my ticket
for Bilbao at the ticket-office in Bayonne, where I come from. Just
after I had got it a lady comes up to me and says: 'Excuse me,
monsieur; I heard you say you were going to Bilbao. I wonder
whether you would do me a favour?' 'Charmed, madamoiselle,' I
replied. She handed me the walking-stick and said, 'Will you take
this stick to my husband? He values it very much. He will give you
two hundred francs for your kindness.' I said I was delighted. I am
a poor man, and I have three children, one ailing. She said, 'Wait
two minutes and I'll get you the address.' She disappeared in the
crowd. A few minutes later an individual came up to me that I
didn't like the look of at all. He looked like a bull-fighter. He
said: 'The lady can't come back, but it's all right. Your
instructions are this&mdash;you've got to hang on to that cane like
grim death and never let it out of your sight. On the platform
you'll see an old woman with two umbrellas. You go up to her and
let her see you've got the stick, but you don't speak to her. You
keep close to her all the way to Bilbao, especially in the Customs.
The next morning after you get to Bilbao, you walk along the Calle
Major at twelve-fifteen. Just before you come to San Stefano you'll
meet a man with a blue rosette in his buttonhole. You hand him the
stick, and he'll give you an envelope containing two hundred
francs. That's all you have to do. It's money easily made. Only
don't let there be any nonsense.' He held his face close to mine
and said in a horrible voice: 'If you footle the little arrangement
you'll get a knife between your ribs.' And there it is, Monsieur
Inspector. I've footled it. I'm in danger. Oh! I wish I'd never
seen the stick."</p>

<p>Freycinet counted out the gold pieces. There were exactly two
hundred and seventy-eight. They fitted perfectly into the hollow of
the stick, which had obviously been made for them. He deliberately
poured them all back into the stick and snapped the top to. Then,
to the amazement of the traveller in hosiery, he handed it back to
him and said:</p>

<p>"We don't want you to be killed, Monsieur Grimaux; continue your
journey and carry out your instructions, and not a word of this to
anyone."</p>

<p>When this dazed individual had managed to escape from the room,
Freycinet turned to Tolozan and said:</p>

<p>"I see your point. It is more necessary to find out where this
gold comes from than where it goes to."</p>

<p>He rang a bell and a subordinate appeared.</p>

<p>"Tardieu," he said, "follow that man who has just gone out of
the bureau with a kit-bag and walking-stick. He's going to Bilbao.
But I want you to follow the stick and not the man. When he gives
it up, follow the person he has given it to, and come back and
report as soon as possible."</p>

<p>When the sub-inspector had gone, Tolozan nodded sagely.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to do that night, so the friends
adjourned to a local caf&eacute;, and Tolozan was quite eloquent
upon the new theories of Professor Einstein, the influence of Comte
upon modern theological reactions, and the splendour of rum
omelettes as supplied by the stepmother of one of his daughter's
school friends. Freycinet was sometimes a little abstracted during
these dissertations. He could not get his mind off the case in
hand. While Tolozan was talking about relativity, he was
thinking:</p>

<p>"How am I going to get hold of the real culprits? The old lady
with the two umbrellas is not going to run undue risks. A clever
idea to get all this smuggling done for you by innocent people. Who
is he? Who gets hold of the gold in the first place? Where does it
go to? It's all so disconnected. Whoever I arrest will say they
know nothing about it. There must be some big organisation at the
back somewhere. Who is it? What does Tolozan think? Damn
Einstein!"</p>

<p>Three days later Tardieu returned. This was his story. He had
followed the traveller in hosiery to Bilbao. The man had gone to a
quiet hotel, where Tardieu also secured a room. He had gone to bed
early and taken the walking-stick with him. The next morning he had
taken it out. He appeared very agitated. He sat about on the
boulevards, and kept on looking at his watch. At twelve o'clock he
had walked quickly to the Calle Major. There he had met a man with
a blue rosette in his buttonhole. He handed the cane over to him,
and received an envelope in exchange. Tardieu followed the man with
the blue rosette. He entered a restaurant and ordered lunch. In a
few minutes another man entered and joined him at table. They
talked quietly and were quick over their lunch. When it was
finished they parted, but Tardieu observed that in the process of
departure they had exchanged walking-sticks. He followed the second
man, who hailed a cab. Tardieu also got a cab and bade the driver
follow. They drove up to the commercial centre of the Town. The man
got out and entered a building divided up into various business
offices. He went up on the first floor and entered a room labelled
"Private." It was part of a suite of rooms belonging to a big
banking concern connected with one of the South American republics.
Tolozan would not tell the name of this republic, but I gathered
that it was a country whose Government had never been very friendly
to France.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in these offices Tardieu lost sight of the
walking-stick. The individual he had tracked returned without it in
about twenty minutes' time and drove away. The detective watched
the building for twenty-four hours, and though clerks and officials
were coming and going all the time no one came out with the
walking-stick. He then thought it advisable to report to his chief
as he had been instructed to do so as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"H'm," thought Freycinet. "I've bungled it again. We have lost
sight of the stick. To find it on its way back to Paris will be
like looking for a needle in a haystack."</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to do but to lie in wait for it at
Irun station and trust to luck. He detailed two inspectors to go
through each train as it came through, and to search for the stick
in most unlikely places. He and Tardieu took up positions in the
Custom House. Tolozan wandered languidly hither and thither. On the
second day, on the morning train the old lady with the two
umbrellas appeared, and the staff doubled their exertions. She
seemed less talkative than usual, and was attracting little
attention. Neither did there appear to be anyone dancing attendance
upon her. Several walking-sticks appeared in the Custom House, but
not one that resembled the all-important one to the slightest
degree. Freycinet was beginning to feel discouraged. He felt that
his whole career depended upon his success over this search. To
fail would be a terrible misfortune, but to fail under the eye of
Tolozan, and helped by his advice, would make the position doubly
bitter. He rushed hither and thither like a terrier on a rabbit
warren. It irritated him at one moment to observe Tolozan idly
chatting with a tall angular English clergyman, a ridiculous
foreign tourist in a mackintosh, and carrying the inevitable bag of
golf-clubs. As he passed he heard Tolozan droning about "mashies"
and "niblicks." Why wasn't he helping in the hunt? What had he come
from Bordeaux for? In five minutes' time the express would be
leaving and another opportunity lost. Five minutes, four minutes,
three minutes&mdash;someone tapped him on the shoulder. It was
Tolozan. Tolozan, with a slight flush of excitement tingling his
normal lethargy. He nodded in the direction of the train.</p>

<p>"In the third coach," he whispered. "Bound for Paris."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The English cur&eacute;, the golf player."</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"He's got the walking-stick in his golf-bag."</p>

<p>A horn was blowing, warning people of the departure of the
train.</p>

<p>"<i>En voiture! En voiture!</i>"</p>

<p>Freycinet leaped upon that train like a cat springing at a bird.
It was very crowded, and he had to stand in the corridor. He had to
stand in the corridor nearly all the way to Paris, but he felt that
the discomfort was thoroughly justified. In a corner seat lolled
the angular English clergyman, with his golf-clubs in a bag on the
rack above him. Freycinet had plenty of time to consider how to
act. He wandered about the corridor and smoked until lunch was
served in the dining-car. As he expected, the clergyman was one of
the first to make a bee-line for that abode of material
refreshment. When he had gone, Freycinet slipped into his seat. He
was glad of the rest. He waited a few minutes; then he reached up
and pulled things about on the rack, as though searching for
something. The action was sufficient to enable him to verify
Tolozan's statement. There was the walking-stick, buried amongst
mashies and niblicks and drivers. He smiled contentedly and read a
newspaper. At the end of an hour the reverend gentleman returned.
Freycinet jumped up and said in English:</p>

<p>"Pardon, sir. I had not the good fortune to secure a seat, so I
took advantage of your absence to take a little rest."</p>

<p>"Quayte! Quayte! Don't let me disturb you."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, monsieur. I should not think of usurping&mdash;excuse
me."</p>

<p>The little scrimmage in manners was sufficient to inaugurate a
formal acquaintanceship. They talked about the weather, and the
luncheon service on the train, and the condition of the greens on
the San Sebastian golf course. Then Freycinet went in to lunch
himself. He had no desire to be more intimate with the clergyman
than the exigencies of the case demanded. He spoke to him once or
twice on the journey to Paris, but it was not until the train was
slackening up on its last run through that long tunnel into the
Gare Quai d'Orsay that Freycinet suddenly whispered:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, monsieur. In your golf-bag you have a walking-stick.
Will you be good enough to tell me how you came by it?"</p>

<p>The clergyman looked surprised, hesitated, and said
blushingly,</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;H'm&mdash;yes. Quayte. Quayte so. Rather peculiah
affair. Man at San Sebastian station&mdash;ah&mdash;came up to me
and asked me if I would object to taking it to Paris. Some
other&mdash;ah&mdash;um&mdash;fellow at the Quai d'Orsay with an
ambah tiepin in a blue tie would meet me and ask for it&mdash;very
old and&mdash;ah&mdash;valuable
stick&mdash;heirloom&mdash;ha&mdash;h'm&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>The man was at the station all right, and the clergyman
departed.</p>

<p>(If the Reverend Peter Dorking, of Instill Rectory, near
Dewsbury, should ever read these lines, let him stand up and take
note that he was very nearly involved in a very serious case.
Moreover, he might just as well have had the courage to speak the
truth. There was nothing to be ashamed of in the fact that it was a
<i>lady</i> who gave him the stick and not a man!)</p>

<p>In any case, with the advent of the man with the "ambah" tiepin,
Freycinet's interest in the clergyman vanished. He became very
alert. As I said before, I had to dig all these details out of
Tolozan. He contended that the case was the making of Freycinet,
and that he showed great acumen and energy over it. Of course, he
took no credit for any of it to himself. However that may be, it is
certain that Freycinet is now held in high esteem by the Police
Intelligence Headquarters in Paris, as well as by certain members
of the Government. The disappointing thing is that I am pledged in
secrecy to Tolozan not to reveal a certain name. When he came to it
he seemed so reluctant to mention it that he eventually wrote it
down on the back of an envelope and then tore it into little pieces
with an angry gesture. The sight of that name made me gasp.</p>

<p>It appears that the same procedure was followed as that which
had taken place in Bilbao, when Tardieu followed up the delivery of
the walking-stick. The man with the amber tiepin drove to a small
caf&eacute; in the Rue de la Boetie. There he was joined by a man
and a girl. They had two drinks together, and then the man and the
girl departed, and the walking-stick again changed hands. Freycinet
nearly missed them, owing to the difficulty of picking up a taxi,
but he got one just as they were nearly out of sight. A Parisian
taxi-driver requires no encouragement to drive like a madman,
because that is his normal method. The cabs raced up the Champs
Elys&eacute;es and turned to the left. They drove down the Avenue
Malakof, and then the front cab began to pull up.</p>

<p>Freycinet said that when he observed the house where the cab
stopped he felt his heart beating violently. He knew the gorgeous
Renaissance edifice quite well by sight. It belonged to one of the
wealthiest and most influential men in Paris, a member of the
Government, and a high official at the Treasury. We will call him
Monsieur P&mdash; . Freycinet could not believe but that there must
be some mistake, and then certain rumours and stories recurred to
him. The two people departed, and an hour later he saw Monsieur
P&mdash; himself come out of the house and enter his car. He was
carrying the walking-stick in his hand. Freycinet had dismissed his
cab, and there were none others about. He stopped and pretended to
light a cigarette. He heard Monsieur P&mdash; say:</p>

<p>"Drive first to the Treasury."</p>

<p>It was easy to see how the gold of the Republic was leaking
away!</p>

<p>In describing this incident Monsieur Tolozan looked as though he
were still tingling with the sense of outrage; then he smiled
wistfully, and added:</p>

<p>"As you may imagine, my friend, gold was not the only thing at
the back of this affair. As occurs not infrequently in our beloved
France, a woman was the agent of a man's destruction. They never
arrested Monsieur P&mdash; . With one so highly placed a different
procedure is usually adopted. He was simply notified that there was
to be an interpellation, that certain facts were to be made public.
You may remember the unfortunate affair of Monsieur P&mdash; . He
slept in a small room on the first floor in that house in the
Avenue Malakof. One night, a week after these events, he went to
bed as usual, but some servant had been tinkering with the top of
the stove which heated the room. Disgracefully careless, these
servants! The gas trickled out&mdash;hour after hour passed. Poor
fellow! He was found quite dead by his man-servant in the morning.
A deplorable ending to a brilliant career...deplorable, most
deplorable."</p>

<p>"But the woman?" I ventured to interject.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the woman. Truly...As you know, Monsieur P&mdash; was
an elderly married man of irreproachable social character. He had
two sons, one in the Army and the other in the Diplomatic Service.
This woman suddenly appeared, no one quite knows from where. She
was a Spanish woman, not particularly beautiful, but she exercised
strange powers over many men. She was a dancer and actress, and
went by the name of 'Juanita.' Indeed, she still sings and dances
at our best variety theatres. She dances beautifully. If it would
not bore you, we might go together this evening to see her. She is
dancing at the Casino de Paris."</p>

<p>"That would be delightful. But tell me, Monsieur Tolozan, was
this woman in any way responsible for P&mdash;'s criminal smuggling
of gold?"</p>

<p>"We have every reason to believe so, but we could never bring
anything home to her. She is clever, very clever. We know that,
although of Spanish stock, she comes originally from that South
American State I have mentioned. She has wealthy and influential
friends there, and she returns every year. Paris harbours many such
women. She is a clever actress on the stage, but an even cleverer
one off."</p>

<p>"You have had experience of it?"</p>

<p>"On one occasion, yes."</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"She was the old lady with the two umbrellas."</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens! Tolozan, why haven't they arrested her?"</p>

<p>"Arrested! Tell me, what did she ever do except cross the front
with one superfluous umbrella? There's nothing criminal in that.
Come, let us go to the Casino. You will be delighted."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. The Everlasting Club</h2>

<p>On the night of November 11th, 1918, seven men sat round a table
in an old barn in an obscure spot in Picardy. The news of the
Armistice had come through in the morning, and it was apparent that
the occupants of the barn were about to celebrate this historic
occasion with what means they had at their disposal. It cannot be
said that their faces expressed the kind of hysterical elation
which was at that moment marking the faces of the revellers in
Paris. London, and New York. Their faces certainly expressed
relief, but it was relief tempered by the too close contact of late
experience. They were like men dazed and a little drugged. Perhaps
their environment had something to do with this. The barn was dark,
and cold, and draughty. The rain was beating against the roof. A
small kerosene lamp, smelling abominably, gave out a feeble
suggestion of warmth. The table was lighted with candles stuck into
bottles. Perhaps their remoteness from their fellows gave them a
feeling that the news was unbelievable, or that it might be
contradicted any moment. The War had been on too long, and the
weariness and agony of it were stamped upon their faces.</p>

<p>McLagan and Treadway were <i>pukka</i> soldiers of the old army.
The other five had joined up early in the War. All had seen much
active service. Ross had served a year in Salonica and two years in
Mespot. Bessimer had nearly died from dysentery in Egypt.
Reid-Andover and Pirbright had been in Russia with Denikin.
McLagan, Treadway, and Dawbarn had spent the whole of their time in
France and Flanders. The reason of their meeting in this obscure
spot is of no consequence. It was in accordance with instructions
of certain higher authorities, who were apparently as unprepared
for the end of the War as they were for the beginning. It concerned
a report that was to be</p>

<p>drawn up upon the potentialities for military purposes of
certain by-products in local quarries. This was looking far ahead,
and now&mdash;well, the War was over. The 'vine having passed.
McLagan, who was the senior officer present, rose and said rather
huskily:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the King!"</p>

<p>They all rose and barked in chorus: "The King!"</p>

<p>They drank the King's health, and then, as though the toast had
stirred them for the first time at some peculiar angle, making them
feel a little self-conscious, a little ashamed of this surprising
emotion, they began to task more animatedly.</p>

<p>Naturally they talked shop. They talked about "shows" and
blunders and guns, and old friends who had gone west. They appeared
diffident about discussing the future. They talked as though the
War was still going on.</p>

<p>Monsieur Poiret, who owned the ruined farmstead adjoining, had
supplied them with fowls and pork and vegetables. Their environment
was depressing, but the dinner was adequate. There was an unlimited
supply of fairly good red and white wine, and someone had produced
a bottle of brandy.</p>

<p>Pirbright and Dawbarn had only arrived that day, and were
strangers to the rest. But as the meal progressed, the whole
company found they had much in common. This was probably due to the
fact that in view of the nature of the enquiry they were called
upon to make, they were men of somewhat similar training,
experience, and education. In civilian life Pirbright and Bessimer
were both metallurgists. Reid-Andover was a fuel expert. Dawbarn
had done a lot of scientific research. Ross was a mining engineer.
McLagan and Treadway had been in the Geological department of the
Indian Army before the War.</p>

<p>Before the meal was finished they were discussing science and
moral philosophy, metaphysics, history, astronomy, sociology, and
even religion, the kind of subjects that are not habitually
discussed in an officers' mess. The meal being finished, and
cleared away, coffee was served and the bottle of brandy opened.
The table they were seated at was a circular one, and so it cannot
be said that anyone sat at the head of it. But if there was one man
who dominated it by force of personality that man was McLagan.</p>

<p>He was a big man with a long tapering jaw, dark reflecti?e eyes,
and black hair. Celt was written all over him. He was nicknamed
"The Wringer," and for this reason: he had a terrible grip. When he
shook hands he would bring tears into the eyes of the strongest,
and he was quite unconscious of it. He wore, moreover, a heavy
signet ring on his third finger, and after shaking hands with him
many a man would bear the impression of that ring upon his hand for
days. He was as animated a listener as he was talker. His eyes
wandered eagerly from one face to another as though he were drawing
them all together. He presided over them by an implied sense of
authority. His colleague, Treadway, sat on his right. He was a
typical officer of the modern school, tall, and almost too spare,
with close-cropped grey hair, sensitively modelled features, and
eyes whose gentleness and kindliness seemed to belie the profession
of arms. He listened, entranced by anything that McLagan said.</p>

<p>Bessimer was the only one of the company whose frame did not
seem too lean in that guttering candlelight, and even he looked fit
and hard in spite of greater girth, probably the result of taking
less exercise than the others. For he had an artificial leg. Ross
was a Scotsman, hollow-cheeked, and highly strung. He had a habit
of nodding his head constantly when spoken to, and mumbling
staccato acquiescence, as though anxious to agree and be done with
it. Reid-Andover, with his little clipped moustache and large
appealingly dark eyes, looked like a small dog with a biscuit on
its nose waiting for the words "Paid for!" He had left three
fingers of his right hand somewhere in Northern Russia.</p>

<p>Dawbarn was the oldest man present, quite grey and nearly bald.
His voice was almost inaudible and his eyes bloodshot, the result
of being gassed in Flanders. He made pathetic attempts to be gay
and to enter into the various arguments.</p>

<p>Pirbright was a poet. At least, he should have been a poet. He
was a man of abstractions, ideas, and visions. He loved to theorize
and speculate. He was the only one who talked of the future, and
even then with languid detachment. When someone mentioned the
Germans, he muttered: "Poor devils !" and lapsed into a reverie of
his own. He was tall and fair, with a large nose, the track of a
bullet along his left cheekbone, and a piece of his left ear
missing.</p>

<p>The evening wore on, and the men, huddling round the little
kerosene lamp, forgot the cold in the heat of argument. And they
talked of life and death and immortality. Each one of them, it was
found, believed in a life hereafter, but the manner in which man
was to survive, and the conditions of his future state, supplied
the matter for a spirited debate. The candles guttered in the
bottles, and others were produced. The rain had penetrated the roof
and dripped steadily into a pool in the corner. The brandy was
finished, but there was still plenty of tobacco and red wine.
McLagan did not smoke. He had a habit of leaning forward as he
spoke, with his large hands interlocked, and suddenly he would
throw back his head, disengage his hands, and emphasize a point by
shaking his index finger in the air. He made a Macabre figure
sitting there in the ill-lit barn, his dark eyes alight with a kind
of malicious excitement.</p>

<p>It was considerably past midnight when someone suggested that it
was time to turn in. McLagan had been silent for some time, deep in
thought. Suddenly he spoke:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, don't go for a moment. I want to make a
suggestion."</p>

<p>They all regarded him, and he leaned forward, peering into the
lamp.</p>

<p>"This is perhaps the most profound day in the history of human
life. It is hall-marked for posterity. It is an everlasting day. We
have all met under rather queer and exceptional circumstances. We
have talked of immortality. We are seven&mdash;a good Biblical
number. I suggest that in our fashion we immortalize this day."</p>

<p>He stopped, and the others watched him interestedly, expecting
him to go on, but he only continued to stare into the stove. At
last Bessimer said:</p>

<p>"In what way, McLagan?"</p>

<p>He looked up as though startled, and spoke quietly:</p>

<p>"Looking into the eyes of death every day for four years and a
half as we all have, we should go mad if we did not believe in the
Everlastingness of things. Let us form a club and demonstrate our
faith&mdash;just as seven."</p>

<p>He paused again, and Ross said:</p>

<p>"What kind of club, McLagan?"</p>

<p>"An Everlasting Club. Roughly speaking, I propose that we meet
on this date once a year in some remote place, like this barn. We
have a chairman and a secretary. We conduct it quite formally. We
dine perhaps, cooking our own food, for no stranger must be
present. Then afterwards we have a debate&mdash;some man putting
forward some new theory or record of experience or belief. We
discuss it in the manner we talked things over to-night. That is
all."</p>

<p>"But how would this be everlasting?" said Ross, nodding his head
jerkily. "We shall all die one at a time. Do you mean that when we
die another is elected in our place?"</p>

<p>"No," said McLagan. "That would be a negation of the idea. That
would be a concession that things are not everlasting."</p>

<p>And then he explained his idea of the Everlasting Club. The
others stared at him dumbfounded. The smoke from their pipes
trailed between them and away into the dim obscure corners of the
barn. A night bird screamed overhead, and McLagan went on talking.
Treadway gaped at him like one bewitched. Pirbright forgot to
smoke. Bessimer, Dawbarn, and Ross regarded him solemnly. Only Ross
appeared frankly cynical, nodding approval and speaking
disapproval.</p>

<p>"It's a mad idea, McLagan," he repeated more than once.
"Besides, it's dangerous. I wouldn't have anything to do with
it."</p>

<p>But when McLagan had finished his explanation, and the room
remained silent, except for the water dripping into the pool,
Pirbright stood up and said:</p>

<p>"I will join you for one, and I propose McLagan as President of
the Everlasting Club."</p>

<p>"And I will join," said Dawbarn, "and I second that
proposition."</p>

<p>"And I," whispered Reid-Andover huskily.</p>

<p>"I will join," said Bessimer, "if I do not have to return to
Egypt. I see no danger in it, Ross."</p>

<p>"No, no, not for me," said Ross. "I won't touch it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Ross," said McLagan, "don't spoil our Biblical
number. Whatever danger can there be in it? It is only an
experiment, an experiment of faith. What else are we likely to
extract from this chaos? The War is over, but the troubles of the
poor old world are not over. Nevertheless, the whole thing may have
been worth while if out of the ashes emerges a knowledge of the
Everlasting."</p>

<p>"Knowledge!" gasped Ross. "I had an aunt once&mdash;in Edinburgh
it was&mdash;she had knowledge&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;went
mad!"</p>

<p>It is a remarkable tribute to the power of personality that
McLagan persuaded these other six men&mdash;including Ross in the
end&mdash;to join the astonishing club. Neither at first did there
appear to be anything so very astonishing about it. It appeared an
ordinary enough social club formed for the purposes of meeting once
a year&mdash;on Armistice Day&mdash;to debate, and discuss, and
establish a complete belief in the Everlasting. It did not meet for
two years, partly owing to the fact that Bessimer did go to Egypt
and Treadway had to return to India. But Bessimer again got fever
in Egypt and had to return to England the following summer.
Treadway retired from the Indian Army and came home at about the
same time. McLagan persuaded Treadway to take on the secretaryship,
and the first meeting was held on November 11th, 1920, in a
bungalow up on Leith Hill in Surrey. It was a disused bungalow on
an estate that had been left to McLagan by an uncle. The men had
all been interested in each other, and felt drawn together by the
associations of that historic evening in Picardy, and they fell in
with the idea eagerly, all with the exception of Ross, who went
down under protest, feeling, however, that he could not let his
comrades in.</p>

<p>The first meeting was quite an ordinary and cheery evening.
Except for the fact that the bungalow was waterproof, McLagan had
tried to reproduce as far as possible the same conditions as those
that prevailed in the barn in Picardy. They took food down with
them, which he and Treadway cooked. The room was lighted by candles
stuck in bottles, and warmed by a stove. Little Reid-Andover
created a round of laughter by saying that he only made one
stipulation about the Club, that was that he didn't have to have
his hand shaken by the president every time. They dined gaily,
talking of old times and friends, and drank red wine. When the meal
was finished they cleared the table and started the discussion.
Pirbright&mdash;by previous arrangement&mdash;read a brief but
thoughtful paper on "The Reasonableness of Re-Incarnation."
Bessimer spoke in opposition. Treadway, who wrote shorthand, took
down a summary of all the speeches. They were to be copied out and
embodied in the archives of the Club. Every member spoke in turn,
and McLagan gave a judicial summing up. Forgetting his
apprehensions in the excitement of debate, Ross spoke as eagerly as
anyone.</p>

<p>There would have been little to distinguish between this meeting
of the Everlasting Club and the next, had it not been that early in
the following autumn Dawbarn died. He caught a chill playing golf
one day in the rain, and, his lungs already affected by poison gas,
he contracted double pneumonia and died within three days. This
%vas in October, within three weeks of the next meeting of the
Everlasting Club. Now what was going to be McLagan's attitude? He
had made it pretty clear in his original explanation of the aims of
the Club. But how would it operate? Every man had signed a scroll
that under no circumstances would he miss a meeting, and that he
regarded it in very truth <i>as an Everlasting Club</i>. The
members were notified, and the meeting took place. It was the turn
of Ross to open the discussion.</p>

<p>He arrived late and was very much on edge, and his attention was
immediately riveted upon the empty chair that had been set for
Dawbarn; the empty chair, and the cutlery and glass, all as though
he were actually there. The others occupied their accustomed
places. He wanted to talk about Dawbarn, but some curious force
restrained him. He found that it was not the thing. You could talk
<i>to Dawbarn, but not about him</i>!</p>

<p>"Do you or do you not believe in the Everlasting?" a voice
seemed to whisper.</p>

<p>Dawbarn's absence was ignored. McLagan was in great spirits,
carrying in the fowl which he had roasted himself, making jokes
with Reid-Andover, proposing toasts. And all the time Ross's eye
kept wandering to the empty chair. He could almost see Dawbarn with
close-cropped hair and little bald head leaning over his plate. He
could almost hear his wheezy voice:</p>

<p>"My dear McLagan, my contention is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Treadway calmly read the minutes of the last meeting, as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>There was something terrible in the sinister assurance of
McLagan, and when in the course of the debate that followed he
suddenly turned to the empty chair and said:</p>

<p>"You will remember that at our last meeting, Dawbarn, you
referred to the Absolute&mdash;" Ross wanted to cry out. He could
not concentrate. Pirbright was also obviously overwrought, but the
others had succumbed to the spell of their chief. They carried on
the discussion with spirit and enthusiasm. The Everlasting Club
survived its first test.</p>

<p>In chronicling the activities of this remarkable Club, one must
make allowances for the unusual nature of its mental composition,
partly sentimental, partly ironic, partly genuinely interested in
psychological experiment, and wholly dominated by one strong and
dominating personality. The more Ross dreaded the meetings the more
keenly did he look forward to them, the more influenced was he by
the strange character of McLagan. Each meeting was like an entirely
novel experience, and productive of stimulating thought. It was
like an adventure on some uncharted island.</p>

<p>There were two meetings held around the empty chair of Dawbarn,
and then an even greater disaster befell the Club. Treadway was
killed in Ireland, and Bessimer died from blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>"That will leave four of us," Ross reflected shudderingly.
"Three empty chairs!"</p>

<p>The contemplation of three empty chairs seemed less disturbing
than the cold certainty of some ultimate and inevitable tragedy.
Ross was the youngest member of the Club, but his heart was weak.
When the four forgathered at the next meeting, his mind wavered
between the horror of two alternate visions. Perhaps next year his
chair would be empty, and still McLagan would be addressing him.
"You will remember, my dear Ross, that last year you
contended&mdash;" Would he be listening? Would he see the bubbles
in the wine poured out for him?...but there was a horror that he
dreaded more than that. He felt it coming, that inevitable
fate&mdash;to be the last to prove the Everlasting. The years
passed and Pirbright died.</p>

<p>And then Reid-Andover, Ross, and McLagan met and they looked
into each other's eyes without expressing the thoughts that lay
behind them. Four empty chairs! and Reid-Andover, who was now the
secretary, quickly read the minutes of the last meeting. The
records of the Club now formed quite a volume, and contained matter
that was in the nature of revelation, sacred to the members alone.
Nothing disturbed the equanimity of McLagan. He was more assured
than ever. Only his dark eyes searched the faces of the other two,
as though the only danger might lurk there.</p>

<p>The time had come when certain things had got to be said, and it
was McLagan's mission to say them. He leaned across the table and
gripped the hands of the other two men in his.</p>

<p>"Listen, you fellows," he said, "remember Treadway and Bessimer
both went the same year. It's possible two of us might go this. Let
us swear, whoever is left of us three, that he will see this
through to the end. This is an Everlasting Club. Swear! Swear!"</p>

<p>"God! I hope it won't be me," said Reid-Andover, "but I
swear."</p>

<p>"I swear, too," said Ross, his voice sounding faint and
distant.</p>

<p>"I swear," said McLagan firmly.</p>

<p>Reid-Andover had his wish gratified with dramatic suddenness,
for he was drowned the following autumn off the West Coast of
Scotland, his sailing-boat capsizing in a sudden gale.</p>

<p>"Now there's only McLagan," thought Ross, when he heard the
news. "I knew this would be. It was predestined. If only I could
die!"</p>

<p>He thought of going abroad, or writing to McLagan to say he
couldn't face it. But the more he desired to escape the closer he
felt bound to his obligations. He had promised. Besides, the
thought of betraying McLagan brought beads of perspiration to his
brow. It was he who held the book when they next met, and read the
minutes with as much control as he could display. Five empty
chairs! and McLagan never so buoyant. He had extended his spiritual
adventures. He had much to say, and there was much to be entered in
the book.</p>

<p>"On that night, Ross, in the barn at La Villanay, we little
thought we should get as far as this..."</p>

<p>He seized Ross's hand once more in his strong grip.</p>

<p>"One of us, Ross, will be the last. Swear on your honour, for
the last time perhaps, that if it is you who are left you will see
this thing through."</p>

<p>"I shall be the last," Ross replied hoarsely. "I feel it. It's
inevitable. I've known it from the first."</p>

<p>"Swear, then!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I swear...I swear."</p>

<p>They closed up the bungalow and left it for a year. And the next
year they met again. Ross had aged. His face was thin and drawn,
his expression preoccupied. He felt ill and overwrought. They went
through the usual formalities, lighting the candles, cooking a
modest meal, setting the table for the seven. They read the book,
and added to it.</p>

<p>A voice seemed to whisper t? Ross: "I shall never see McLagan
again. But perhaps before the year is out I, too, shall have
gone."</p>

<p>They took the same vows over the book as before. As they were
parting McLagan said:</p>

<p>"Queer that the only thing the Great War has perpetuated
is&mdash;the Unknown. It is as though human society had reacted to
the clamour of its idols. In our hearts we preserve the conviction
of unknown faiths. In our temples we bury the&mdash;Unknown
Soldier. It is like starting all over again in our search for the
Everlasting."</p>

<p>One night in the late autumn McLagan was found dead in bed in an
hotel at Deauville. There was a certain amount of mystery
concerning his death. The tap of a gas-stove was turned on a
fraction of an inch, but whether this was accidental or intentional
no one could say. Death from misadventure was recorded. Ross heard
the news with equanimity. He was fully prepared for it. What
concerned him the more was the state of his own health. He
consulted a specialist, who affirmed that the condition of his
heart was serious. He should have a long and complete rest.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will a little later on," he said. To himself he
thought:</p>

<p>"I will not believe that McLagan ran away. He was not a coward.
In any case, I am under my vow."</p>

<p>October came and went, and the yellow leaves vanished on the
wind, dismantling the stage for the bleak and sombre entrance of
November. Ross checked the procession of eleven days, wherein
leaden skies, fog, rain, and darkness mingled in indivisible
proportion. When the eleventh day dawned, he thought to himself:
"And to think that it was this day so many years ago when the world
went nearly mad with joy! Where is it all gone, the sense of
relief, the spirit of brotherhood and forgiveness, that illumined
the face of humanity for twelve brief hours'</p>

<p>Of the task before him he felt little apprehension. His mind had
grown accustomed to it, and was more occupied with abstract
problems than with concrete fears. He filled a despatch case with
the records of the Everlasting Club. lie took wine with him and a
little food and set off for the bungalow in the hills. It was pitch
dark long before he got there.</p>

<p>He thrust the key into the rusty lock and stumbled in. He struck
matches and lighted the candles and the stove. He set the table,
and placed the seven chairs in position. He hummed t? himself as he
grilled a small piece of steak. The mist drifted in between the
crevices of the windows and the door. The room seemed unnaturally
dark. He drank two glasses of the red wine, and when he had eaten
as much of the steak as he could, he stood up and said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the King!"</p>

<p>He gulped the wine and glanced at the six empty chairs. There
they all seemed to be, watching him. Dawbarn and Pirbright, little
Reid-Andover, the solemn Bessimer, Treadway, elegant and urbane,
and more insistent than all&mdash;McLagan. He could almost hear
McLagan's sardonic laugh, and see the dark eyes checking his
movements.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the Everlasting Club !"</p>

<p>He drank this second toast in grim silence. The boards creaked,
and he thought he heard a mouse or rat gnawing in the
wainscoting.</p>

<p>He read the minutes of the last meeting, stressing t? the full
the balanced logic and the argument as promulgated by the
president. He gave a brief summary of his own comments. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Is it your wish, gentlemen, that these minutes be passed?"</p>

<p>He glanced round the table and accepted the uncanny silence as
consent. He signed them, and then rose once more t? open the last
debate. He spoke precisely as though all the other members were
present. He struggled t? concentrate on the abstraction of their
united experiences. Once he thought he heard rain dripping into a
pool in the corner of the room, and that he&mdash;and
they&mdash;were back once more in the barn at La Villanay on
Armistice night. He felt a sudden desire to scream. He wanted to
scream into the growing obscurity across the table to McLagan:</p>

<p>"You fool!...You fool!...don't you know it yet? There's no such
thing as the Everlasting. Everything changes."</p>

<p>He gazed wild-eyed at McLagan's chair, and a cold fear settled
on his heart.</p>

<p>He pulled himself upright, and muttered:</p>

<p>"All right, McLagan, all right. I promised."</p>

<p>He struggled on till the candles guttered in the bottles and the
stove went out. Suddenly he threw himself forward and stretched his
right arm out in the direction of McLagan's chair.</p>

<hr>

<p>A gardener on the estate found him next morning lying face
downwards on the table, his right arm stretched out. And the
gardener noticed that the fingers of his hand were pressed closely
together, as though they had been held in a powerful grip, and on
two of the fingers was a mark that might have been indented by a
metal ring. By his side were the charred remnants of a book.</p>
