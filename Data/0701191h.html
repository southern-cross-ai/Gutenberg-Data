<h2><a name="ch1"></a>No. 1 - THE GATEWAY OF THE MONSTER</h2>

<h3>[From The Idler, January 1910]</h3>

<h4>(Thomas Carnacki, the famous Investigator of "real" ghost stories, tells
here his incredibly weird experience in the Electric Pentacle)</h4>

<p>In response to Carnacki's usual card of invitation to have dinner and listen
to a story, I arrived promptly at 427, Cheyne Walk, to find the three others
who were always invited to these happy little times, there before me. Five
minutes later, Carnacki, Arkright, Jessop, Taylor and I were all engaged in the
"pleasant occupation" of dining.</p>

<p>"You've not been long away, this time," I remarked as I finished my soup;
forgetting momentarily, Carnacki's dislike of being asked even to skirt the
borders of his story until such time as he was ready. Then he would not stint
words.</p>

<p>"That's all," he replied with brevity; and I changed the subject, remarking
that I had been buying a new gun, to which piece of news he gave an intelligent
nod, and a smile which I think showed a genuinely good-humoured appreciation of
my intentional changing of the conversation.</p>

<p>Later, when dinner was finished, Carnacki snugged himself comfortably down
in his big chair, along with his pipe, and began his story, with very little
circumlocution:</p>

<p>"As Dodgson was remarking just now, I've only been away a short time, and
for a very good reason too&mdash;I've only been away a short distance. The
exact locality I am afraid I must not tell you; but it is less than twenty
miles from here; though, except for changing a name, that won't spoil the
story. And it is a story too! One of the most extraordinary things I have ever
run against.</p>

<p>"I received a letter a fortnight ago from a man I must call Anderson, asking
for an appointment. I arranged a time, and when he came, I found that he wished
me to investigate, and see whether I could not clear up a long-standing and
well&mdash;too well&mdash;authenticated case of what he termed 'haunting.' He
gave me very full particulars, and finally, as the thing seemed to present
something unique, I decided to take it up.</p>

<p>"Two days later, I drove to the house, late in the afternoon. I found it a
very old place, standing quite alone in its own grounds. Anderson had left a
letter with the butler, I found, pleading excuses for his absence, and leaving
the whole house at my disposal for my investigations. The butler evidently knew
the object of my visit, and I questioned him pretty thoroughly during dinner,
which I had in rather lonely state. He is an old and privileged servant, and
had the history of the Grey Room exact in detail. From him I learned more
particulars regarding two things that Anderson had mentioned in but a casual
manner. The first was that the door of the Grey Room would be heard in the dead
of night to open, and slam heavily, and this even though the butler knew it was
locked, and the key on the bunch in his pantry. The second was that the
bedclothes would always be found torn off the bed, and hurled in a heap into a
corner.</p>

<p>"But it was the door slamming that chiefly bothered the old butler. Many and
many a time, he told me, had he lain awake and just got shivering with fright,
listening; for sometimes the door would be slammed time after time&mdash;thud!
thud! thud!&mdash;so that sleep was impossible.</p>

<p>"From Anderson, I knew already that the room had a history extending back
over a hundred and fifty years. Three people had been strangled in it&mdash;an
ancestor of his and his wife and child. This is authentic, as I had taken very
great pains to discover, so that you can imagine it was with a feeling that I
had a striking case to investigate, that I went upstairs after dinner to have a
look at the Grey Room.</p>

<p>"Peter, the old butler, was in rather a state about my going, and assured me
with much solemnity that in all the twenty years of his service, no one had
ever entered that room after nightfall. He begged me, in quite a fatherly way,
to wait till the morning, when there would be no danger, and then he could
accompany me himself.</p>

<p>"Of course, I smiled a little at him, and told him not to bother. I
explained that I should do no more than look around a bit, and perhaps affix a
few seals. He need not fear; I was used to that sort of thing. But he shook his
head, when I said that.</p>

<p>"'There isn't many ghosts like ours, sir,' he assured me, with mournful
pride. And, by Jove! he was right, as you will see.</p>

<p>"I took a couple of candles, and Peter followed, with his bunch of keys. He
unlocked the door; but would not come inside with me. He was evidently in a
fright, and renewed his request, that I would put off my examination, until
daylight. Of course, I laughed at him again, and told him he could stand sentry
at the door, and catch anything that came out.</p>

<p>"'It never comes outside, sir,' he said, in his funny, old, solemn manner.
Somehow he managed to make me feel as if I were going to have the 'creeps'
right away. Anyway, it was one to him, you know.</p>

<p>"I left him there, and examined the room. It is a big apartment, and well
furnished in the grand style, with a huge four-poster, which stands with its
head to the end wall. There were two candles on the mantelpiece and two on each
of the three tables that were in the room. I lit the lot, and after that the
room felt a little less inhumanly dreary; though, mind you, it was quite fresh,
and well kept in every way.</p>

<p>"After I had taken a good look round I sealed lengths of baby ribbon across
the windows, along the walls, over the pictures, and over the fireplace and the
wall-closets. All the time, as I worked, the butler stood just without the
door, and I could not persuade him to enter; though I jested with him a little,
as I stretched the ribbons, and went here and there about my work. Every now
and again, he would say:&mdash;'You'll excuse me, I'm sure, sir; but I do wish
you would come out, sir. I'm fair in a quake for you.'</p>

<p>"I told him he need not wait; but he was loyal enough in his way to what he
considered his duty. He said he could not go away and leave me all alone there.
He apologised; but made it very clear that I did not realise the danger of the
room; and I could see, generally, that he was in a pretty frightened state. All
the same, I had to make the room so that I should know if anything material
entered it; so I asked him not to bother me, unless he really heard something.
He was beginning to get on my nerves, and the 'feel' of the room was bad
enough, without making it any nastier.</p>

<p>"For a time further, I worked, stretching ribbons across the floor, and
sealing them, so that the merest touch would have broken them, were anyone to
venture into the room in the dark with the intention of playing the fool. All
this had taken me far longer than I had anticipated; and, suddenly, I heard a
clock strike eleven. I had taken off my coat soon after commencing work; now,
however, as I had practically made an end of all that I intended to do, I
walked across to the settee, and picked it up. I was in the act of getting into
it when the old butler's voice (he had not said a word for the last hour) came
sharp and frightened:&mdash;'Come out, sir, quick! There's something going to
happen!' Jove! but I jumped, and then, in the same moment, one of the candles
on the table to the left of the bed went out. Now whether it was the wind, or
what, I do not know; but just for a moment, I was enough startled to make a run
for the door; though I am glad to say that I pulled up before I reached it. I
simply could not bunk out, with the butler standing there, after having, as it
were, read him a sort of lesson on 'bein' brave, y'know.' So I just turned
right round, picked up the two candles off the mantelpiece, and walked across
to the table near the bed. Well, I saw nothing. I blew out the candle that was
still alight; then I went to those on the two other tables, and blew them out.
Then, outside of the door, the old man called again:&mdash;'Oh! sir, do be
told! Do be told!'</p>

<p>"'All right, Peter,' I said, and, by Jove, my voice was not as steady as I
should have liked! I made for the door, and had a bit of work, not to start
running. I took some thundering long strides, as you can imagine. Near the
door, I had a sudden feeling that there was a cold wind in the room. It was
almost as if the window had been suddenly opened a little. I got to the door
and the old butler gave back a step, in a sort of instinctive way. 'Collar the
candles, Peter!' I said, pretty sharply, and shoved them into his hands. I
turned, and caught the handle, and slammed the door shut, with a crash.
Somehow, do you know, as I did so, I thought I felt something pull back on it;
but it must have been only fancy. I turned the key in the lock, and then again,
double-locking the door. I felt easier then, and set-to and sealed the door. In
addition, I put my card over the keyhole, and sealed it there; after which I
pocketed the key, and went downstairs&mdash;with Peter; who was nervous and
silent, leading the way. Poor old beggar! It had not struck me until that
moment that he had been enduring a considerable strain during the last two or
three hours.</p>

<p>"About midnight, I went to bed. My room lay at the end of the corridor upon
which opens the door of the Grey Room. I counted the doors between it and mine,
and found that five rooms lay between. And I am sure you can understand that I
was not sorry. Then, just as I was beginning to undress, an idea came to me,
and I took my candle and sealing-wax, and sealed the doors of all the five
rooms. If any door slammed in the night, I should know just which one.</p>

<p>"I returned to my room, locked the door, and went to bed. I was waked
suddenly from a deep sleep by a loud crash somewhere out in the passage. I sat
up in bed and listened, but heard nothing. Then I lit my candle. I was in the
very act of lighting it when there came the bang of a door being violently
slammed, along the corridor. I jumped out of bed, and got my revolver. I
unlocked my door, and went out into the passage, holding my candle high, and
keeping the pistol ready. Then a queer thing happened. I could not go a step
towards the Grey Room. You all know I am not really a cowardly chap. I've gone
into too many cases connected with ghostly things, to be accused of that; but I
tell you I funked it; simply funked it, just like any blessed kid. There was
something precious unholy in the air that night. I backed into my bedroom, and
shut and locked the door. Then I sat on the bed all night, and listened to the
dismal thudding of a door up the corridor. The sound seemed to echo through all
the house.</p>

<p>"Daylight came at last, and I washed and dressed. The door had not slammed
for about an hour, and I was getting back my nerve again. I felt ashamed of
myself; though in some ways it was silly, for when you're meddling with that
sort of thing, your nerve is bound to go, sometimes. And you just have to sit
quiet and call yourself a coward until daylight. Sometimes it is more than just
cowardice, I fancy. I believe at times it is something warning you, and
fighting for you. But, all the same, I always feel mean and miserable, after a
time like that.</p>

<p>"When the day came properly, I opened my door, and, keeping my revolver
handy, went quietly along the passage. I had to pass the head of the stairs, on
the way, and who should I see coming up, but the old butler, carrying a cup of
coffee. He had merely tucked his nightshirt into his trousers, and he had an
old pair of carpet slippers on.</p>

<p>"'Hello, Peter!' I said, feeling suddenly cheerful; for I was as glad as any
lost child to have a live human being close to me. 'Where are you off to with
the refreshments?'</p>

<p>"The old man gave a start, and slopped some of the coffee. He stared up at
me and I could see that he looked white and done-up. He came on up the stairs
and held out the little tray to me. 'I'm very thankful indeed, sir, to see you
safe and well,' he said. 'I feared, one time, you might risk going into the
Grey Room, sir. I've lain awake all night, with the sound of the door. And when
it came light, I thought I'd make you a cup of coffee. I knew you would want to
look at the seals, and somehow it seems safer if there's two, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Peter,' I said, 'you're a brick. This is very thoughtful of you.' And I
drank the coffee. 'Come along,' I told him, and handed him back the tray. 'I'm
going to have a look at what the brutes have been up to. I simply hadn't the
pluck to in the night.'</p>

<p>"'I'm very thankful, sir,' he replied. 'Flesh and blood can do nothing, sir,
against devils; and that's what's in the Grey Room after dark.'</p>

<p>"I examined the seals on all the doors, as I went along, and found them
right; but when I got to the Grey Room, the seal was broken; though the card,
over the keyhole, was untouched. I ripped it off, and unlocked the door, and
went in, rather cautiously, as you can imagine; but the whole room was empty of
anything to frighten one, and there was heaps of light. I examined all my
seals, and not a single one was disturbed. The old butler had followed me in,
and, suddenly, he called out:&mdash;'The bedclothes, sir!'</p>

<p>"I ran up to the bed, and looked over; and, surely, they were lying in the
corner to the left of the bed. Jove! you can imagine how queer I felt.
Something had been in the room. I stared for a while, from the bed, to the
clothes on the floor. I had a feeling that I did not want to touch either. Old
Peter, though, did not seem to be affected that way. He went over to the
bed-coverings, and was going to pick them up, as, doubtless, he had done every
day these twenty years back; but I stopped him. I wanted nothing touched, until
I had finished my examination. This, I must have spent a full hour over, and
then I let Peter straighten up the bed; after which we went out and I locked
the door; for the room was getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>"I had a short walk, and then breakfast; after which I felt more my own man,
and so returned to the Grey Room, and, with Peter's help, and one of the maids,
I had everything taken out except the bed, even the very pictures. I examined
the walls, floor and ceiling then, with probe, hammer and magnifying glass; but
found nothing suspicious. And I can assure you, I began to realise, in very
truth, that some incredible thing had been loose in the room during the past
night. I sealed up everything again, and went out, locking and sealing the
door, as before.</p>

<p>"After dinner that night, Peter and I unpacked some of my stuff, and I fixed
up my camera and flashlight opposite to the door of the Grey Room, with a
string from the trigger of the flashlight to the door. Then, you see, if the
door were really opened, the flashlight would blare out, and there would be,
possibly, a very queer picture to examine in the morning. The last thing I did,
before leaving, was to uncap the lens; and after that I went off to my bedroom,
and to bed; for I intended to be up at midnight; and to ensure this, I set my
little alarm to call me; also I left my candle burning.</p>

<p>"The clock woke me at twelve, and I got up and into my dressing-gown and
slippers. I shoved my revolver into my right side-pocket, and opened my door.
Then, I lit my dark-room lamp, and withdrew the slide, so that it would give a
clear light. I carried it up the corridor, about thirty feet, and put it down
on the floor, with the open side away from me, so that it would show me
anything that might approach along the dark passage. Then I went back, and sat
in the doorway of my room, with my revolver handy, staring up the passage
towards the place where I knew my camera stood outside the door of the Grey
Room.</p>

<p>"I should think I had watched for about an hour and a half, when, suddenly,
I heard a faint noise, away up the corridor. I was immediately conscious of a
queer prickling sensation about the back of my head, and my hands began to
sweat a little. The following instant, the whole end of the passage flicked
into sight in the abrupt glare of the flashlight. Then came the succeeding
darkness, and I peered nervously up the corridor, listening tensely, and trying
to find what lay beyond the faint glow of my dark-lamp, which now seemed
ridiculously dim by contrast with the tremendous blaze of the
flash-powder...And then, as I stooped forward, staring and listening, there
came the crashing thud of the door of the Grey Room. The sound seemed to fill
the whole of the large corridor, and go echoing hollowly through the house. I
tell you, I felt horrible&mdash;as if my bones were water. Simply beastly.
Jove! how I did stare, and how I listened. And then it came again&mdash;thud,
thud, thud, and then a silence that was almost worse than the noise of the
door; for I kept fancying that some brutal thing was stealing upon me along the
corridor. And then, suddenly, my lamp was put out, and I could not see a yard
before me. I realised all at once that I was doing a very silly thing, sitting
there, and I jumped up. Even as I did so, I thought I heard a sound in the
passage, and quite near me. I made one backward spring into my room, and
slammed and locked the door. I sat on my bed, and stared at the door. I had my
revolver in my hand; but it seemed an abominably useless thing. I felt that
there was something the other side of that door. For some unknown reason I knew
it was pressed up against the door, and it was soft. That was just what I
thought. Most extraordinary thing to think.</p>

<p>"Presently I got hold of myself a bit, and marked out a pentacle hurriedly
with chalk on the polished floor; and there I sat in it almost until dawn. And
all the time, away up the corridor, the door of the Grey Room thudded at solemn
and horrid intervals. It was a miserable, brutal night.</p>

<p>"When the day began to break, the thudding of the door came gradually to an
end, and, at last, I got hold of my courage, and went along the corridor, in
the half light, to cap the lens of my camera. I can tell you, it took some
doing; but if I had not done so my photograph would have been spoilt, and I was
tremendously keen to save it. I got back to my room, and then set-to and rubbed
out the five-pointed star in which I had been sitting.</p>

<p>"Half an hour later there was a tap at my door. It was Peter with my coffee.
When I had drunk it, we both went along to the Grey Room. As we went, I had a
look at the seals on the other doors, but they were untouched. The seal on the
door of the Grey Room was broken, as also was the string from the trigger of
the flashlight; but the card over the keyhole was still there. I ripped it off
and opened the door. Nothing unusual was to be seen until we came to the bed;
then I saw that, as on the previous day, the bedclothes had been torn off, and
hurled into the left-hand corner, exactly where I had seen them before. I felt
very queer; but I did not forget to look at all the seals, only to find that
not one had been broken.</p>

<p>"Then I turned and looked at old Peter, and he looked at me, nodding his
head.</p>

<p>"'Let's get out of here!' I said. 'It's no place for any living human to
enter, without proper protection.'</p>

<p>"We went out then, and I locked and sealed the door, again.</p>

<p>"After breakfast, I developed the negative; but it showed only the door of
the Grey Room, half opened. Then I left the house, as I wanted to get certain
matters and implements that might be necessary to life; perhaps to the spirit;
for I intended to spend the coming night in the Grey Room.</p>

<p>"I got back in a cab, about half-past-five, with my apparatus, and this,
Peter and I carried up to the Grey Room, where I piled it carefully in the
centre of the floor. When everything was in the room, including a cat which I
had brought, I locked and sealed the door, and went towards my bedroom, telling
Peter I should not be down to dinner. He said, 'Yes, sir, and went downstairs,
thinking that I was going to turn in, which was what I wanted him to believe,
as I knew he would have worried both me and himself, if he had known what I
intended.</p>

<p>"But I merely got my camera and flashlight from my bedroom, and hurried back
to the Grey Room. I locked and sealed myself in, and set to work, for I had a
lot to do before it got dark.</p>

<p>"First I cleared away all the ribbons across the floor; then I carried the
cat&mdash;still fastened in its basket&mdash;over towards the far wall, and
left it. I returned then to the centre of the room, and measured out a space
twenty-one feet in diameter, which I swept with a 'broom of hyssop.' About this
I drew a circle of chalk, taking care never to step over the circle. Beyond
this I smudged, with a bunch of garlic, a broad belt right around the chalked
circle, and when this was complete, I took from among my stores in the centre a
small jar of a certain water. I broke away the parchment and withdrew the
stopper. Then, dipping my left forefinger in the little jar, I went round the
circle again, making upon the floor, just within the line of chalk, the Second
Sign of the Saaamaaa Ritual, and joining each Sign most carefully with the
left-handed crescent. I can tell you, I felt easier when this was done and the
'water circle' complete. Then, I unpacked some more of the stuff that I had
brought, and placed a lighted candle in the "valley" of each crescent. After
that, I drew a pentacle, so that each of the five points of the defensive star
touched the chalk circle. In the five points of the star I placed five portions
of bread, each wrapped in linen, and in the five "vales," five opened jars of
the water I had used to make the water circle. And now I had my first
protective barrier complete.</p>

<p>"Now, anyone, except you who know something of my methods of investigation,
might consider all this a piece of useless and foolish superstition; but you
all remember the Black Veil case, in which I believe my life was saved by a
very similar form of protection, whilst Aster, who sneered at it, and would not
come inside, died. I got the idea from the Sigsand MS., written, so far as I
can make out, in the Fourteenth Century. At first, naturally, I imagined it was
just an expression of the superstition of his time; and it was not until a year
later that it occurred to me to test his 'Defense,' which I did, as I've just
said, in that horrible Black Veil business. You know how that turned out.
Later, I used it several times, and always I came through safe, until that
Moving Fur case. It was only a partial "Defense" there and I nearly died in the
pentacle. After that I came across Professor Garder's 'Experiments with a
Medium.' When they surrounded the medium with a current, in vacuum, he lost his
power&mdash;almost as if it cut him off from the Immaterial. That made me think
a lot; and that is how I came to make the Electric Pentacle, which is a most
marvellous 'Defense' against certain manifestations. I used the shape of the
defensive star for this protection, because I have, personally, no doubt at all
but that there is some extraordinary virtue in the old magic figure. Curious
thing for a Twentieth-Century man to admit, is it not? But then, as you all
know, I never did, and never will, allow myself to be blinded by a little cheap
laughter. I ask questions, and keep my eyes open!</p>

<p>"In this last case I had little doubt that I had run up against a
supernatural monster, and I meant to take every possible care; for the danger
is abominable.</p>

<p>"I turned&mdash;to now to fit the Electric Pentacle, setting it so that each
of its 'points' and 'vales' coincided exactly with the 'points' and 'vales' of
the drawn pentagram upon the floor. Then I connected up the battery, and the
next instant the pale blue glare from the intertwining vacuum tubes shone
out.</p>

<p>"I glanced about me then, with something of a sigh of relief, and realised
suddenly that the dusk was upon me, for the window was grey and unfriendly.
Then round at the big, empty room, over the double barrier of electric and
candle light. I had an abrupt, extraordinary sense of weirdness thrust upon
me&mdash;in the air, you know; as it were, a sense of something inhuman
impending. The room was full of the stench of bruised garlic, a smell I
hate.</p>

<p>"I turned now to my camera, and saw that it and the flashlight were in
order. Then I tested my revolver, carefully; though I had little thought that
it would be needed. Yet, to what extent materialisation of an ab-natural
creature is possible, given favourable conditions, no one can say, and I had no
idea what horrible thing I was going to see, or feel the presence of. I might,
in the end, have to fight with a materialised monster. I did not know, and
could only be prepared. You see, I never forgot that in the bed close to me
three people had been strangled, and the fierce slamming of the door I had
heard myself. I had no doubt that I was investigating a dangerous and ugly
case.</p>

<p>"By this time the night had come; though the room was very light with the
burning candles; and I found myself glancing behind me, constantly, and then
all round the room. It was nervy work waiting for that thing to come. Then,
suddenly, I was aware of a little, cold wind sweeping over me, coming from
behind. I gave one great nerve-thrill, and a prickly feeling went all over the
back of my head. Then I hove myself round with a sort of stiff jerk, and stared
straight against that queer wind. It seemed to come from the corner of the room
to the left of the bed&mdash;the place where both times I had found the heap of
tossed bedclothes. Yet, I could see nothing unusual; no
opening&mdash;nothing!...</p>

<p>"Abruptly I was aware that the candles were all a-flicker in that unnatural
wind...I believe I just squatted there and stared in a horribly frightened,
wooden way for some minutes. I shall never be able to let you know how
disgustingly horrible it was sitting in that vile, cold wind! And then, flick!
flick! all the candles round the outer barrier went out; and there was I,
locked and sealed in that room, and with no light beyond the weakish blue glare
of the Electric Pentacle.</p>

<p>"A time of abominable tenseness passed, and still that wind blew upon me;
and then, suddenly, I knew that something stirred in the corner to the left of
the bed. I was made conscious of it, rather by some inward, unused sense, than
by either sight or sound; for the pale, short-radius glare of the pentacle gave
but a very poor light for seeing by. Yet, as I stared, something began slowly
to grow upon my sight&mdash;a moving shadow, a little darker than the
surrounding shadows. I lost the thing amid the vagueness, and for a moment or
two I glanced swiftly from side to side, with a fresh, new sense of impending
danger. Then my attention was directed to the bed. All the coverings were being
drawn steadily off, with a hateful, stealthy sort of motion. I heard the slow,
dragging slither of the clothes; but I could see nothing of the thing that
pulled. I was aware in a funny, subconscious, introspective fashion that the
'creep' had come upon me; yet I was cooler mentally than I had been for some
minutes; sufficiently so to feel that my hands were sweating coldly, and to
shift my revolver, half-consciously, whilst I rubbed my right hand dry upon my
knee; though never, for an instant, taking my gaze or my attention from those
moving clothes.</p>

<p>"The faint noises from the bed ceased once, and there was a most intense
silence, with only the sound of the blood beating in my head. Yet, immediately
afterwards, I heard again the slurring of the bedclothes being dragged off the
bed. In the midst of my nervous tension I remembered the camera, and reached
round for it; but without looking away from the bed. And then, you know, all in
a moment, the whole of the bed-coverings were torn off with extraordinary
violence, and I heard the flump they made as they were hurled into the
corner.</p>

<p>"There was a time of absolute quietness then for perhaps a couple of
minutes; and you can imagine how horrible I felt. The bedclothes had been
thrown with such savageness! And then again, the brutal unnaturalness of the
thing that had just been done before me!</p>

<p>"Abruptly, over by the door, I heard a faint noise&mdash;a sort of crickling
sound and then a pitter or two upon the floor. A great nervous thrill swept
over me, seeming to run up my spine and over the back of my head; for the seal
that secured the door had just been broken. Something was there. I could not
see the door; at least, I mean to say that it was impossible to say how much I
actually saw, and how much my imagination supplied. I made it out only as a
continuation of the grey walls...And then it seemed to me that something dark
and indistinct moved and wavered there among the shadows.</p>

<p>"Abruptly, I was aware that the door was opening, and with an effort I
reached again for my camera; but before I could aim it the door was slammed
with a terrific crash that filled the whole room with a sort of hollow thunder.
I jumped, like a frightened child. There seemed such a power behind the noise;
as though a vast, wanton Force were 'out.' Can you understand?</p>

<p>"The door was not touched again; but, directly afterwards, I heard the
basket, in which the cat lay, creak. I tell you, I fairly pringled all along my
back. I knew that I was going to learn definitely whether what was abroad was
dangerous to Life. From the cat there rose suddenly a hideous caterwaul, that
ceased abruptly, and then&mdash;too late&mdash;I snapped on the flashlight. In
the great glare, I saw that the basket had been overturned, and the lid was
wrenched open, with the cat lying half in, and half out upon the floor. I saw
nothing else, but I was full of the knowledge that I was in the presence of
some Being or Thing that had power to destroy.</p>

<p>"During the next two or three minutes, there was an odd, noticeable
quietness in the room, and you must remember I was half-blinded, for the time,
because of the flashlight; so that the whole place seemed to be pitchy dark
just beyond the shine of the pentacle. I tell you it was most horrible. I just
knelt there in the star, and whirled round, trying to see whether anything was
coming at me.</p>

<p>"My power of sight came gradually, and I got a little hold of myself; and
abruptly I saw the thing I was looking for, close to the 'water circle.' It was
big and indistinct, and wavered curiously, as though the shadow of a vast
spider hung suspended in the air, just beyond the barrier. It passed swiftly
round the circle, and seemed to probe ever towards me; but only to draw back
with extraordinary jerky movements, as might a living person if he touched the
hot bar of a grate.</p>

<p>"Round and round it moved, and round and round I turned. Then, just opposite
to one of the 'vales' in the pentacles, it seemed to pause, as though
preliminary to a tremendous effort. It retired almost beyond the glow of the
vacuum light, and then came straight towards me, appearing to gather form and
solidity as it came. There seemed a vast, malign determination behind the
movement, that must succeed. I was on my knees, and I jerked back, falling on
to my left hand and hip, in a wild endeavour to get back from the advancing
thing. With my right hand I was grabbing madly for my revolver, which I had let
slip. The brutal thing came with one great sweep straight over the garlic and
the 'water circle,' almost to the vale of the pentacle. I believe I yelled.
Then, just as suddenly as it had swept over, it seemed to be hurled back by
some mighty, invisible force.</p>

<p>"It must have been some moments before I realised that I was safe; and then
I got myself together in the middle of the pentacles, feeling horribly gone and
shaken, and glancing round and round the barrier; but the thing had vanished.
Yet I had learnt something, for I knew now that the Grey Room was haunted by a
monstrous hand.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, as I crouched there, I saw what had so nearly given the monster
an opening through the barrier. In my movements within the pentacle I must have
touched one of the jars of water; for just where the thing had made its attack
the jar that guarded the 'deep' of the 'vale' had been moved to one side, and
this had left one of the 'five doorways' unguarded. I put it back, quickly, and
felt almost safe again, for I had found the cause and the 'defense' was still
good. And I began to hope again that I should see the morning come in. When I
saw that thing so nearly succeed, I'd had an awful, weak, overwhelming feeling
that the 'barriers' could never bring me safe through the night against such a
Force. You can understand?</p>

<p>"For a long time I could not see the hand; but, presently, I thought I saw,
once or twice, an odd wavering, over among the shadows near the door. A little
later, as though in a sudden fit of malignant rage, the dead body of the cat
was picked up, and beaten with dull, sickening blows against the solid floor.
That made me feel rather queer.</p>

<p>"A minute afterwards, the door was opened and slammed twice with tremendous
force. The next instant the thing made one swift, vicious dart at me, from out
of the shadows. Instinctively I started sideways from it, and so plucked my
hand from upon the Electric Pentacle, where&mdash;for a wickedly careless
moment&mdash;I had placed it. The monster was hurled off from the neighbourhood
of the pentacles; though&mdash;owing to my inconceivable foolishness&mdash;it
had been enabled for a second time to pass the outer barriers. I can tell you,
I shook for a time, with sheer funk. I moved right to the centre of the
pentacles again, and knelt there, making myself as small and compact as
possible.</p>

<p>"As I knelt, there came to me presently, a vague wonder at the two
'accidents' which had so nearly allowed the brute to get at me. Was I being
influenced to unconscious voluntary actions that endangered me? The thought
took hold of me, and I watched my every movement. Abruptly, I stretched a tired
leg, and knocked over one of the jars of water. Some was spilled; but because
of my suspicious watchfulness, I had it upright and back within the vale while
yet some of the water remained. Even as I did so, the vast, black,
half-materialised hand beat up at me out of the shadows, and seemed to leap
almost into my face; so nearly did it approach; but for the third time it was
thrown back by some altogether enormous, over-mastering force. Yet, apart from
the dazed fright in which it left me, I had for a moment that feeling of
spiritual sickness, as if some delicate, beautiful, inward grace had suffered,
which is felt only upon the too near approach of the ab-human, and is more
dreadful, in a strange way, than any physical pain that can be suffered. I knew
by this, more of the extent and closeness of the danger; and for a long time I
was simply cowed by the butt-headed brutality of that Force upon my spirit. I
can put it no other way.</p>

<p>"I knelt again in the centre of the pentacles, watching myself with more
fear, almost, than the monster; for I knew now that, unless I guarded myself
from every sudden impulse that came to me, I might simply work my own
destruction. Do you see how horrible it all was?</p>

<p>"I spent the rest of the night in a haze of sick fright, and so tense that I
could not make a single movement naturally. I was in such fear that any desire
for action that came to me might be prompted by the Influence that I knew was
at work on me. And outside of the barrier that ghastly thing went round and
round, grabbing and grabbing in the air at me. Twice more was the body of the
dead cat molested. The second time, I heard every bone in its body scrunch and
crack. And all the time the horrible wind was blowing upon me from the corner
of the room to the left of the bed.</p>

<p>"Then, just as the first touch of dawn came into the sky, that unnatural
wind ceased, in a single moment; and I could see no sign of the hand. The dawn
came slowly, and presently the wan light filled all the room, and made the pale
glare of the Electric Pentacle look more unearthly. Yet, it was not until the
day had fully come, that I made any attempt to leave the barrier, for I did not
know but that there was some method abroad, in the sudden stopping of that
wind, to entice me from the pentacles.</p>

<p>"At last, when the dawn was strong and bright, I took one last look round,
and ran for the door. I got it unlocked, in a nervous, clumsy fashion; then
locked it hurriedly, and went to my bedroom, where I lay on the bed, and tried
to steady my nerves. Peter came, presently, with the coffee, and when I had
drunk it, I told him I meant to have a sleep, as I had been up all night. He
took the tray, and went out quietly; and after I had locked my door I turned in
properly, and at last got to sleep.</p>

<p>"I woke about midday, and after some lunch, went up to the Grey Room. I
switched off the current from the pentacle, which I had left on in my hurry;
also, I removed the body of the cat. You can understand I did not want anyone
to see the poor brute. After that, I made a very careful search of the corner
where the bedclothes had been thrown. I made several holes, and probed, but
found nothing. Then it occurred to me to try with my instrument under the
skirting. I did so, and heard my wire ring on metal. I turned the hook-end that
way, and fished for the thing. At the second go, I got it. It was a small
object, and I took it to the window. I found it to be a curious ring, made of
some greyish metal. The curious thing about it was that it was made in the form
of a pentagon; that is, the same shape as the inside of the magic pentacle, but
without the "mounts" which form the points of the defensive star. It was free
from all chasing or engraving.</p>

<p>"You will understand that I was excited, when I tell you that I felt sure I
held in my hand the famous Luck Ring of the Anderson family; which, indeed, was
of all things the one most intimately connected with the history of the
haunting. This ring was handed on from father to son through generations, and
always&mdash;in obedience to some ancient family tradition&mdash;each son had
to promise never to wear the ring. The ring, I may say, was brought home by one
of the Crusaders, under very peculiar circumstances; but the story is too long
to go into here.</p>

<p>"It appears that young Sir Hulbert, an ancestor of Anderson's, made a bet,
in drink, you know, that he would wear the ring that night. He did so, and in
the morning his wife and child were found strangled in the bed, in the very
room in which I stood. Many people, it would seem, thought young Sir Hulbert
was guilty of having done the thing in drunken anger; and he, in an attempt to
prove his innocence, slept a second night in the room. He also was strangled.
Since, as you may imagine, no one has spent a night in the Grey Room, until I
did so. The ring had been lost so long, that it had become almost a myth; and
it was most extraordinary to stand there, with the actual thing in my hand, as
you can understand.</p>

<p>"It was whilst I stood there, looking at the ring, that I got an idea.
Supposing that it were, in a way, a doorway&mdash;You see what I mean? A sort
of gap in the world-hedge. It was a queer idea, I know, and probably was not my
own, but came to me from the Outside. You see, the wind had come from that part
of the room where the ring lay. I thought a lot about it. Then the
shape&mdash;the inside of a pentacle. It had no 'mounts,' and without mounts,
as the Sigsand MS. has it:&mdash;'Thee mownts wych are thee Five Hills of
safetie. To lack is to gyve pow'r to thee daemon; and surlie to fayvor thee
Evill Thynge.' You see, the very shape of the ring was significant; and I
determined to test it.</p>

<p>"I unmade my pentacle, for it must be made afresh and around the one to be
protected. Then I went out and locked the door; after which I left the house,
to get certain matters, for neither 'yarbs nor fyre nor water' must be used a
second time. I returned about seven-thirty, and as soon as the things I had
brought had been carried up to the Grey Room, I dismissed Peter for the night,
just as I had done the evening before. When he had gone downstairs, I let
myself into the room and locked and sealed the door. I went to the place in the
centre of the room where all the stuff had been packed, and set to work with
all my speed to construct a barrier about me and the ring.</p>

<p>"I do not remember whether I explained to you. But I had reasoned that if
the ring were in any way a 'medium of admission,' and it were enclosed with me
in the Electric Pentacle it would be, to express it loosely, insulated. Do you
see? The Force, which had visible expression as a hand, would have to stay
beyond the barrier which separates the Ab from the Normal; for the 'gateway'
would be removed from accessibility.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, I worked with all my speed to get the barrier completed
about me and the ring, for it was already later than I cared to be in that room
'unprotected.' Also, I had a feeling that there would be a vast effort made
that night to regain the use of the ring. For I had the strongest conviction
that the ring was a necessity to materialisation. You will see whether I was
right.</p>

<p>"I completed the barriers in about an hour, and you can imagine something of
the relief I felt when I saw the pale glare of the Electric Pentacle once more
all about me. From then, onwards, for about two hours, I sat quietly, facing
the corner from which the wind came. About eleven o'clock a queer knowledge
came that something was near to me; yet nothing happened for a whole hour after
that. Then, suddenly, I felt the cold, queer wind begin to blow upon me. To my
astonishment, it seemed now to come from behind me, and I whipped round, with a
hideous quake of fear. The wind met me in the face. It was blowing up from the
floor close to me. I stared down, in a sickening maze of new frights. What on
earth had I done now! The ring was there, close beside me, where I had put it.
Suddenly, as I stared, bewildered, I was aware that there was something queer
about the ring&mdash;funny shadowy movements and convolutions. I looked at
them, stupidly. And then, abruptly, I knew that the wind was blowing up at me
from the ring. A queer indistinct smoke became visible to me, seeming to pour
upwards through the ring, and mix with the moving shadows. Suddenly, I realised
that I was in more than any mortal danger; for the convoluting shadows about
the ring were taking shape, and the death-hand was forming within the pentacle.
My goodness! do you realise it! I had brought the 'gateway' into the pentacles,
and the brute was coming through&mdash;pouring into the material world, as gas
might pour out from the mouth of a pipe.</p>

<p>"I should think that I knelt for a moment in a sort of stunned fright. Then,
with a mad, awkward movement, I snatched at the ring, intending to hurl it out
of the pentacle. Yet it eluded me, as though some invisible, living thing
jerked it hither and thither. At last, I gripped it; yet, in the same instant,
it was torn from my grasp with incredible and brutal force. A great, black
shadow covered it, and rose into the air, and came at me. I saw that it was the
hand, vast and nearly perfect in form. I gave one crazy yell, and jumped over
the pentacle and the ring of burning candles, and ran despairingly for the
door. I fumbled idiotically and ineffectually with the key, and all the time I
stared, with a fear that was like insanity, toward the barriers. The hand was
plunging towards me; yet, even as it had been unable to pass into the pentacle
when the ring was without, so, now that the ring was within, it had no power to
pass out. The monster was chained, as surely as any beast would be, were chains
rivetted upon it.</p>

<p>"Even then, I got a flash of this knowledge; but I was too utterly shaken
with fright, to reason; and the instant I managed to get the key turned, I
sprang into the passage, and slammed the door with a crash. I locked it, and
got to my room, somehow; for I was trembling so that I could hardly stand, as
you can imagine. I locked myself in, and managed to get the candle lit; then I
lay down on the bed, and kept quiet for an hour or two, and so I got
steadied.</p>

<p>"I got a little sleep, later; but woke when Peter brought my coffee. When I
had drunk it I felt altogether better, and took the old man along with me
whilst I had a look into the Grey Room. I opened the door, and peeped in. The
candles were still burning, wan against the daylight; and behind them was the
pale, glowing star of the Electric Pentacle. And there in the middle was the
ring...the gateway of the monster, lying demure and ordinary.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the room was touched, and I knew that the brute had never
managed to cross the pentacles. Then I went out, and locked the door.</p>

<p>"After a sleep of some hours, I left the house. I returned in the afternoon
in a cab. I had with me an oxy-hydrogen jet, and two cylinders, containing the
gases. I carried the things to the Grey Room, and there, in the centre of the
Electric Pentacle, I erected the little furnace. Five minutes later the Luck
Ring, once the 'luck,' but now the 'bane,' of the Anderson family, was no more
than a little solid splash of hot metal."</p>

<p>Carnacki felt in his pocket, and pulled out something wrapped in tissue
paper. He passed it to me. I opened it and found a small circle of greyish
metal, something like lead, only harder and rather brighter.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked, at length, after examining it and handing it round to the
others. "Did that stop the haunting?"</p>

<p>Carnacki nodded. "Yes," he said. "I slept three nights in the Grey Room,
before I left. Old Peter nearly fainted when he knew that I meant to; but by
the third night he seemed to realise that the house was just safe and ordinary.
And, you know, I believe, in his heart, he hardly approved."</p>

<p>Carnacki stood up and began to shake hands. "Out you go!" he said, genially.
And, presently, we went, pondering to our various homes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>No. 2. - THE HOUSE AMONG THE LAURELS</h2>

<h3>[From The Idler, February 1910]</h3>

<h4>(Thomas Carnacki, the famous Investigator of "real" ghost stories, tells
here the results of his peculiar and weird investigations in The House Among
The Laurels)</h4>

<p>"This is a curious yarn that I am going to tell you," said Carnacki, as
after a quiet little dinner we made ourselves comfortable in his cosy
dining-room.</p>

<p>"I have just got back from the West of Ireland," he continued. "Wentworth, a
friend of mine, has lately had rather an unexpected legacy, in the shape of a
large estate and manor, about a mile and a half outside of the village of
Korunton. The place is named Gannington Manor, and has been empty a great
number of years; as you will find is almost always the case with houses reputed
to be haunted, as it is usually termed.</p>

<p>"It seems that when Wentworth went over to take possession, he found the
place in very poor repair, and the estate totally uncared for, and, as I know,
looking very desolate and lonesome generally. He went through the big house by
himself, and he admitted to me that it had an uncomfortable feeling about it;
but, of course, that might be nothing more than the natural dismalness of a
big, empty house, which has been long uninhabited, and through which you are
wandering alone.</p>

<p>"When he had finished his look round, he went down to the village, meaning
to see the one-time Agent of the Estate, and arrange for someone to go in as
caretaker. The Agent, who proved by the way to be a Scotchman, was very willing
to take up the management of the Estate once more; but he assured Wentworth
that they would get no one to go in as caretaker and that his&mdash;the
Agent's&mdash;advice was to have the house pulled down, and a new one
built.</p>

<p>"This, naturally, astonished my friend, and, as they went down to the
village, he managed to get a sort of explanation from the man. It seems that
there had been always curious stories told about the place, which in the early
days was called Landru Castle, and that within the last seven years there had
been two extraordinary deaths there. In each case they had been tramps, who
were ignorant of the reputation of the house, and had probably thought the big
empty place suitable for a night's free lodging. There had been absolutely no
signs of violence, to indicate the method by which death was caused, and on
each occasion the body had been found in the great entrance hall.</p>

<p>"By this time they had reached the inn where Wentworth had put up, and he
told the Agent that he would prove that it was all rubbish about the haunting,
by staying a night or two in the Manor himself. The death of the tramps was
certainly curious; but did not prove that any supernatural agency had been at
work. They were but isolated accidents, spread over a large number of years by
the memory of villagers, which was natural enough in a little place like
Korunton. Tramps had to die some time, and in some place, and it proved nothing
that two, out of possibly hundreds who had slept in the empty house, had
happened to take the opportunity to die under shelter.</p>

<p>"But the Agent took his remark very seriously, and both he and Dennis, the
landlord of the inn, tried their best to persuade him not to go. For his
'sowl's sake,' Irish Dennis begged him to do no such thing; and because of his
'life's sake,' the Scotchman was equally in earnest.</p>

<p>"It was late afternoon at the time, and as Wentworth told me, it was warm
and bright and it seemed such utter rot to hear those two talking seriously
about the impossible. He felt full of pluck, and he made up his mind he would
smash the story of the haunting, at once by staying that very night, in the
Manor. He made this quite clear to them, and told them that it would be more to
the point and to their credit, if they offered to come up along with him and
keep him company. But poor old Dennis was quite shocked, I believe, at the
suggestion; and though Tabbit, the Agent, took it more quietly, he was very
solemn about it.</p>

<p>"It appears that Wentworth did go; though, as he said to me, when the
evening began to come on, it seemed a very different sort of thing to
tackle.</p>

<p>"A whole crowd of the villagers assembled to see him off; for by this time
they all knew of his intention. Wentworth had his gun with him, and a big
packet of candles; and he made it clear to them all that it would not be wise
for anyone to play any tricks; as he intended to shoot 'at sight.' And then,
you know, he got a hint of how serious they considered the whole thing; for one
of them came up to him, leading a great bull-mastiff, and offered it to him, to
take to keep him company. Wentworth patted his gun; but the old man who owned
the dog, shook his head and explained that the brute might warn him in
sufficient time for him to get away from the castle. For it was obvious that he
did not consider the gun would prove of any use.</p>

<p>"Wentworth took the dog, and thanked the man. He told me that, already, he
was beginning to wish that he had not said definitely that he would go; but, as
it was, he was simply forced to. He went through the crowd of men, and found
suddenly that they had all turned in a body and were keeping him company. They
stayed with him all the way to the Manor, and then went right over the whole
place with him.</p>

<p>"It was still daylight when this was finished; though turning to dusk; and,
for a little, the men stood about, hesitating, as if they felt ashamed to go
away and leave Wentworth there all alone. He told me that, by this time, he
would gladly have given fifty pounds to be going back with them. And then,
abruptly, an idea came to him. He suggested that they should stay with him, and
keep him company through the night. For a time they refused, and tried to
persuade him to go back with them; but finally he made a proposition that got
home to them all. He planned that they should all go back to the inn, and there
get a couple of dozen bottles of whisky, a donkey-load of turf and wood, and
some more candles. Then they would come back, and make a great fire in the big
fire-place, light all the candles, and put them round the place, open the
whisky and make a night of it. And, by Jove! he got them to agree.</p>

<p>"They set off back, and were soon at the inn, and here, while the donkey was
being loaded, and the candles and whisky distributed, Dennis was doing his best
to keep Wentworth from going back; but he was a sensible man in his way; for
when he found that it was no use, he stopped. You see, he did not want to
frighten the others from accompanying Wentworth.</p>

<p>"'I tell ye, sorr,' he told him, ''tis no use at all at all, thryin' ter
reclaim ther castle. 'Tis curst with innocent blood, an' ye'll be betther
pullin' it down, an' buildin' a fine new wan. But if ye be intendin' to shtay
this night, kape the big dhoor open whide, an' watch for the bhlood-dhrip. If
so much as a single dhrip falls, don't shtay though all the gold in the worrld
was offered ye.'</p>

<p>"Wentworth asked him what he meant by the blood-drip.</p>

<p>"'Shure,' he said, ''tis the bhlood av thim as ould Black Mick 'way back in
the ould days kilt in their shlape. 'Twas a feud as he pretendid to patch up,
an' he invited thim&mdash;the O'Haras they was&mdash;sivinty av thim. An' he
fed thim, an' shpoke soft to thim, an' thim thrustin' him, shtayed to shlape
with him. Thin, he an' thim with him, stharted in an' mhurdered thim wan an'
all as they slep'. 'Tis from me father's grandfather ye have the sthory. An'
sence thin 'tis death to any, so they say, to pass the night in the castle whin
the bhlood-drip comes. 'Twill put out candle an' fire, an' thin in the darkness
the Virgin Herself would be powerless to protect ye.'</p>

<p>"Wentworth told me he laughed at this; chiefly because, as he put
it:&mdash;One always must laugh at that sort of yarn, however it makes you feel
inside. He asked old Dennis whether he expected him to believe it.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sorr,' said Dennis, 'I do mane ye to b'lieve it; an', please God, if
ye'll b'lieve, ye may be back safe befor' mornin'.' The man's serious
simplicity took hold of Wentworth, and he held out his hand. But, for all that,
he went; and I must admire his pluck.</p>

<p>"There were now about forty men, and when they got back to the
Manor&mdash;or castle as the villagers always call it&mdash;they were not long
in getting a big fire going, and lighted candles all round the great hall. They
had all brought sticks; so that they would have been a pretty formidable lot to
tackle by anything simply physical; and, of course, Wentworth had his gun. He
kept the whisky in his own charge; for he intended to keep them sober; but he
gave them a good strong tot all round first, so as to make things seem
cheerful; and to get them yarning. If you once let a crowd of men like that
grow silent, they begin to think, and then to fancy things.</p>

<p>"The big entrance door had been left wide open, by his orders; which shows
that he had taken some notice of Dennis. It was a quiet night, so this did not
matter, for the lights kept steady and all went on in a jolly sort of fashion
for about three hours. He had opened a second lot of bottles, and everyone was
feeling cheerful; so much so that one of the men called out aloud to the ghosts
to come out and show themselves. And then, you know, a very extraordinary thing
happened; for the ponderous main door swung quietly and steadily to, as though
pushed by an invisible hand, and shut with a sharp click.</p>

<p>"Wentworth stared, feeling suddenly rather chilly. Then he remembered the
men, and looked round at them. Several had ceased their talk, and were staring
in a frightened way at the big door; but the greater number had never noticed,
and were talking and yarning. He reached for his gun, and the following instant
the great bull-mastiff set up a tremendous barking, which drew the attention of
the whole company.</p>

<p>"The hall I should tell you is oblong. The south wall is all windows; but
the north and the east have rows of doors, leading into the house, whilst the
west wall is occupied by the great entrance. The rows of doors leading into the
house were all closed, and it was towards one of these in the north wall that
the big dog ran; yet he would not go very close; and suddenly the door began to
move slowly open, until the blackness of the passage beyond was shown. The dog
came back among the men, whimpering, and for perhaps a minute there was an
absolute silence.</p>

<p>"Then Wentworth went out from the men a little, and aimed his gun at the
doorway.</p>

<p>"'Whoever is there, come out or I shall fire,' he shouted, but nothing came,
and he blazed both barrels into the dark. As though the report had been a
signal, all the doors along the north and east walls moved slowly open, and
Wentworth and his men were staring, frightened, into the black shapes of the
empty doorways.</p>

<p>"Wentworth loaded his gun quickly, and called to the dog; but the brute was
burrowing away in among the men; and this fear on the dog's part frightened
Wentworth more, he told me, than anything. Then something else happened. Three
of the candles over in the corner of the hall went out; and immediately about
half a dozen in different parts of the place. More candles were put out, and
the hall had become quite dark in the corners.</p>

<p>"The men were all standing now, holding their clubs, and crowded together.
And no one said a word. Wentworth told me he felt positively ill with fright. I
know the feeling. Then, suddenly, something splashed on to the back of his left
hand. He lifted it, and looked. It was covered with a great splash of red that
dripped from his fingers. An old Irishman near to him, saw it, and croaked out
in a quavering voice:&mdash;'The bhlood-dhrip!' When the old man called out,
they all looked, and in the same instant others felt it upon them. There were
frightened cries of:&mdash;'The bhlood-dhrip! The bhlood-dhrip!' And then,
about a dozen candles went out simultaneously, and the hall was suddenly almost
dark. The dog let out a great, mournful howl, and there was a horrible little
silence, with everyone standing rigid. Then the tension broke, and there was a
mad rush for the main door. They wrenched it open, and tumbled out into the
dark; but something slammed it with a crash after them, and shut the dog in;
for Wentworth heard it howling, as they raced down the drive. Yet no one had
the pluck to go back to let it out, which does not surprise me.</p>

<p>"Wentworth sent for me the following day. He had heard of me in connection
with that Steeple Monster Case. I arrived by the night mail, and put up with
Wentworth at the inn. The next day we went up to the old Manor, which certainly
lies in rather a wilderness; though what struck me most was the extraordinary
number of laurel bushes about the house. The place was smothered with them; so
that the house seemed to be growing up out of a sea of green laurel. These, and
the grim, ancient look of the old building, made the place look a bit dank and
ghostly, even by daylight.</p>

<p>"The hall was a big place, and well lit by daylight; for which I was not
sorry. You see, I had been rather wound-up by Wentworth's yarn. We found one
rather funny thing, and that was the great bull-mastiff, lying stiff with its
neck broken. This made me feel very serious; for it showed that whether the
cause was supernatural or not, there was present in the house some force
exceedingly dangerous to life.</p>

<p>"Later, whilst Wentworth stood guard with his shot-gun, I made an
examination of the hall. The bottles and mugs from which the men had drunk
their whisky were scattered about; and all over the place were the candles,
stuck upright in their own grease. But in that somewhat brief and general
search, I found nothing; and decided to begin my usual exact examination of
every square foot of the place&mdash;not only of the hall, in this case, but of
the whole interior of the castle.</p>

<p>"I spent three uncomfortable weeks, searching, but without results of any
kind. And, you know, the care I take at this period is extreme; for I have
solved hundreds of cases of so-called 'hauntings' at this early stage, simply
by the most minute investigation, and the keeping of a perfectly open mind.
But, as I have said, I found nothing. During the whole of the examination I got
Wentworth to stand guard with his loaded shot-gun; and I was very particular
that we were never caught there after dusk.</p>

<p>"I decided now to make the experiment of staying a night in the great hall,
of course 'protected.' I spoke about it to Wentworth; but his own attempt had
made him so nervous that he begged me to do no such thing. However, I thought
it well worth the risk and I managed in the end to persuade him to be
present.</p>

<p>"With this in view I went to the neighbouring town of Gaunt, and by an
arrangement with the Chief Constable I obtained the services of six policemen
with their rifles. The arrangement was unofficial, of course, and the men were
allowed to volunteer, with a promise of payment.</p>

<p>"When the constables arrived early that evening at the inn, I gave them a
good feed; and after that we all set out for the manor. We had four donkeys
with us, loaded with fuel and other matters; also two great boar hounds, which
one of the police led. When we reached the house, I set the men to unload the
donkeys; whilst Wentworth and I set-to and sealed all the doors, except the
main entrance, with tape and wax; for if the doors were really opened, I was
going to be sure of the fact. I was going to run no risk of being deceived by
ghostly hallucination, or mesmeric influence.</p>

<p>"By the time that this was done, the policemen had unloaded the donkeys, and
were waiting, looking about them, curiously. I set two of them to lay a fire in
the big grate, and the others I used as I required them. I took one of the boar
hounds to the end of the hall furthest from the entrance, and there I drove a
staple into the floor, to which I tied the dog with a short tether. Then, round
him, I drew upon the floor the figure of a Pentacle, in chalk. Outside of the
Pentacle, I made a circle with garlic. I did exactly the same thing with the
other hound; but over more in the north-east corner of the big hall, where the
two rows of doors make the angle.</p>

<p>"When this was done, I cleared the whole centre of the hall, and put one of
the policemen to sweep it; after which I had all my apparatus carried into the
cleared space. Then I went over to the main door and hooked it open, so that
the hook would have to be lifted out of the hasp, before the door could be
closed. After that, I placed lighted candles before each of the sealed doors,
and one in each corner of the big room; and then I lit the fire. When I saw
that it was properly alight, I got all the men together, by the pile of things
in the centre of the room, and took their pipes from them; for, as the Sigsand
MS. has it:&mdash;'Theyre must noe lyght come from wythin the barryier.' And I
was going to make sure.</p>

<p>"I got my tape-measure then, and measured out a circle thirty-three feet in
diameter, and immediately chalked it out. The police and Wentworth were
tremendously interested, and I took the opportunity to warn them that this was
no piece of silly mumming on my part; but done with a definite intention of
erecting a barrier between us and any ab-human thing that the night might show
to us. I warned them that, as they valued their lives, and more than their
lives, it might be, no one must on any account whatever pass beyond the limits
of the barrier that I was making.</p>

<p>"After I had drawn the circle, I took a bunch of the garlic, and smudged it
right round the chalk circle, a little outside of it. When this was complete, I
called for candles from my stock of material. I set the police to lighting
them, and as they were lit I took them and sealed them down on to the floor,
just inside the chalk circle, five inches apart. As each candle measured one
inch in diameter, it took sixty-six candles to complete the circle; and I need
hardly say that every number and measurement has a significance.</p>

<p>"Then from candle to candle I took a 'gayrd' of human hair, entwining it
alternately to the left and to the right, until the circle was completed, and
the ends of the final hairs shod with silver, and pressed into the wax of the
sixty-sixth candle.</p>

<p>"It had now been dark some time, and I made haste to get the 'Defense'
complete. To this end, I got the men well together, and began to fit the
Electric Pentacle right around us, so that the five points of the Defensive
Star came just within the Hair-Circle. This did not take me long, and a minute
later I had connected up the batteries, and the weak blue glare of the
intertwining vacuum tubes shone all around us. I felt happier then; for this
Pentacle is, as you all know, a wonderful 'Defense.' I have told you before,
how the idea came to me, after reading Professor Garder's 'Experiments with a
Medium.' He found that a current, a certain number of vibrations, in vacuo,
'insulated' the Medium. It is difficult to suggest an explanation
non-technically, and if you are really interested you should read Garder's
lecture on 'Astarral Vibrations Compared with Matero-involuted Vibrations Below
the Six-Billion Limit.'</p>

<p>"As I stood up from my work, I could hear outside in the night a constant
drip from the laurels, which as I have said, come right up around the house,
very thick. By the sound, I knew that a 'soft' rain had set in; and there was
absolutely no wind, as I could tell by the steady flames of the candles.</p>

<p>"I stood a moment or two, listening, and then one of the men touched my arm,
and asked me in a low voice, what they should do. By his tone, I could tell
that he was feeling something of the strangeness of it all; and the other men,
including Wentworth, were so quiet that I was afraid they were beginning to get
shaky.</p>

<p>"I set-to, then, and arranged them with their backs to one common centre; so
that they were sitting flat upon the floor, with their feet radiating outwards.
Then, by compass, I laid their legs to the eight chief points, and afterwards I
drew a 'circle' with chalk round them; and opposite to their feet, I made the
Eight Signs of the Saaamaaa Ritual. The eighth place was, of course, empty; but
ready for me to occupy at any moment; for I had omitted to make the Sealing
Sign to that point, until I had finished all my preparations, and could enter
the 'Inner Star.'</p>

<p>"I took a last look round the great hall, and saw that the two big hounds
were lying quietly, with their noses between their paws. The fire was big and
cheerful, and the candles before the two rows of doors, burnt steadily, as well
as the solitary ones in the corners. Then I went round the little star of men,
and warned them not to be frightened whatever happened; but to trust to the
'Defense,'; and to let nothing tempt or drive them to cross the Barriers. Also,
I told them to watch their movements, and to keep their feet strictly to their
places. For the rest, there was to be no shooting, unless I gave the word.</p>

<p>"And now at last, I went to my place, and sitting down, made the Eighth Sign
just beyond my feet. Then I arranged my camera and flashlight handy, and
examined my revolver.</p>

<p>"Wentworth sat behind the First Sign, and as the numbering went round
reversed, that put him next to me on my left. I asked him, in a rather low
voice, how he felt; and he told me, rather nervous; but that he had confidence
in my knowledge, and was resolved to go through with the matter, whatever
happened.</p>

<p>"We settled down then to wait. There was no talking, except that, once or
twice the police bent towards one another, and whispered odd remarks concerning
the hall, that appeared queerly audible in the intense silence. But in a while
there was not even a word from anyone, and only the monotonous drip, drip of
the quiet rain without the great entrance, and the low, dull sound of the fire
in the big fire-place.</p>

<p>"It was a queer group that we made sitting there, back to back, with our
legs starred outwards; and all around us the strange blue glow of the Pentacle,
and beyond that the brilliant shining of the great ring of lighted candles.
Outside of the glare of the candles, the large empty hall looked a little
gloomy, by contrast, except where the lights shone before the sealed doors, and
the blaze of the big fire made a good honest mass of flame on the monster
hearth. And the feeling of mystery! Can you picture it all?</p>

<p>"It might have been an hour later that it came to me suddenly that I was
aware of an extraordinary sense of dreeness, as it were, come into the air of
the place. Not the nervous feeling of mystery that had been with us all the
time; but a new feeling, as if there were something going to happen any
moment.</p>

<p>"Abruptly, there came a slight noise from the east end of the hall, and I
felt the star of men move suddenly. 'Steady! Keep steady!' I shouted, and they
quietened. I looked up the hall, and saw that the dogs were up on their feet,
and staring in an extraordinary fashion towards the great entrance. I turned
and stared also, and felt the men move as they craned their heads to look.
Suddenly, the dogs set up a tremendous barking, and I glanced across to them,
and found they were still 'pointing' for the big doorway. They ceased their
noise just as quickly, and seemed to be listening. In the same instant, I heard
a faint chink of metal to my left, that set me staring at the hook which held
the great door wide. It moved, even as I looked. Some invisible thing was
meddling with it. A queer, sickening thrill went through me, and I felt all the
men about me, stiffen and go rigid with intensity. I had a certainty of
something impending; as it might be the impression of an invisible, but
over-whelming, Presence. The hall was full of a queer silence, and not a sound
came from the dogs. Then I saw the hook slowly raised from out of its hasp,
without any visible thing touching it. Then a sudden power of movement came to
me. I raised my camera, with the flashlight fixed, and snapped it at the door.
There came the great flare of the flashlight, and a simultaneous roar of
barking from the two dogs.</p>

<p>"The intensity of the flash made all the place seem dark for some moments,
and in that time of darkness, I heard a jingle in the direction of the door,
and strained to look. The effect of the bright light passed, and I could see
clearly again. The great entrance door was being slowly closed. It shut with a
sharp snick, and there followed a long silence, broken only by the whimpering
of the dogs.</p>

<p>"I turned suddenly, and looked at Wentworth. He was looking at me.</p>

<p>"'Just as it did before,' he whispered.</p>

<p>"'Most extraordinary,' I said, and he nodded and looked round,
nervously.</p>

<p>"The policemen were pretty quiet, and I judged that they were feeling rather
worse than Wentworth; though for that matter, you must not think that I was
altogether natural; yet I have seen so much that is extraordinary, that I
daresay I can keep my nerves steady longer than most people.</p>

<p>"I looked over my shoulder at the men, and cautioned them, in a low voice,
not to move outside of the Barriers, whatever happened; not even though the
house seem to be rocking and about to tumble on to them; for well I knew what
some of the great Forces are capable of doing. Yet, unless it should prove to
be one of the cases of the more terrible Saiitii Manifestation, we were almost
certain of safety, so long as we kept to our order within the Pentacle.</p>

<p>"Perhaps an hour and a half passed, quietly, except when, once in a way, the
dogs would whine distressfully. Presently, however, they ceased even from this,
and I could see them lying on the floor with their paws over their noses, in a
most peculiar fashion, and shivering visibly. The sight made me feel more
serious, as you can understand.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, the candle in the corner furthest from the main door, went out.
An instant later, Wentworth jerked my arm, and I saw that a candle before one
of the sealed doors had been put out. I held my camera ready. Then, one after
another, every candle about the hall was put out, and with such speed and
irregularity that I could never catch one in the actual act of being
extinguished. Yet, for all that, I took a flashlight of the hall in
general.</p>

<p>"There was a time in which I sat half-blinded by the great glare of the
flash, and I blamed myself for not having remembered to bring a pair of smoked
goggles, which I have sometimes used at these times. I had felt the men jump,
at the sudden light, and I called out loud to them to sit quiet, and to keep
their feet exactly to their proper places. My voice, as you can imagine,
sounded rather horrid and frightening in the great room, and altogether it was
a beastly moment.</p>

<p>"Then I was able to see again, and I stared here and there around the hall;
but there was nothing showing unusual; only, of course, it was dark now over in
the corners.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, I saw that the great fire was blackening. It was going out
visibly, as I looked. If I said that some monstrous, invisible, impossible
creature sucked the life from it, I could best explain my impression of the way
the light and flame went out of it. It was most extraordinary to watch. In the
time that I watched it, every vestige of fire was gone from it, and there was
no light outside of the ring of candles around the Pentacle.</p>

<p>"The deliberateness of the thing troubled me more than I can make clear to
you. It conveyed to me such a sense of a calm, Deliberate Force present in the
hall. The steadfast intention to 'make a darkness' was horrible. The extent of
the Power to affect the Material was now the one constant, anxious questioning
in my brain. You can understand?</p>

<p>"Behind me, I heard the policemen moving again, and I knew that they were
getting thoroughly frightened. I turned half round, and told them, quietly but
plainly, that they were safe only so long as they stayed within the Pentacle,
in the position in which I had put them. If they once broke, and went outside
of the Barrier, no knowledge of mine could state the full extent or
dreadfulness of the danger.</p>

<p>"I steadied them up by this quiet, straight reminder; but if they had known,
as I knew, that there is no certainty in any 'Protection,' they would have
suffered a great deal more, and probably have broken the 'Defense' and made a
mad, foolish run for an impossible safety.</p>

<p>"Another hour passed, after this, in an absolute quietness. I had a sense of
awful strain and oppression, as though I were a little spirit in the company of
some invisible, brooding monster of the unseen world, who, as yet, was scarcely
conscious of us. I leant across to Wentworth, and asked him in a whisper
whether he had a feeling as if something were in the room. He looked very pale,
and his eyes kept always on the move. He glanced just once at me and nodded;
then stared away round the hall again. And when I came to think, I was doing
the same thing.</p>

<p>"Abruptly, as though a hundred unseen hands had snuffed them, every candle
in the Barrier went dead out, and we were left in a darkness that seemed, for a
little, absolute; for the light from the Pentacle was too weak and pale to
penetrate far across the great hall.</p>

<p>"I tell you, for a moment, I just sat there as though I had been frozen
solid. I felt the 'creep' go all over me, and seem to stop in my brain. I felt
all at once to be given a power of hearing that was far beyond normal. I could
hear my own heart thudding most extraordinarily loud. I began, however, to feel
better, after a little; but I simply had not the pluck to move. You can
understand?</p>

<p>"Presently, I began to get my courage back. I gripped at my camera and
flashlight, and waited. My hands were simply soaked with sweat. I glanced once
at Wentworth. I could see him only dimly. His shoulders were hunched a little,
his head forward; but though it was motionless, I knew that his eyes were not.
It is queer how one knows that sort of thing at times. The police were just as
silent. And thus a while passed.</p>

<p>"A sudden sound broke across the silence. From two sides of the room there
came faint noises. I recognised them at once, as the breaking of the
sealing-wax. The sealed doors were opening. I raised the camera and flashlight,
and it was a peculiar mixture of fear and courage that helped me to press the
button. As the great belch of light lit up the hall, I felt the men all about
me jump. The darkness fell like a clap of thunder, if you can understand, and
seemed tenfold. Yet, in the moment of brightness, I had seen that all the
sealed doors were wide open.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, all around us, there sounded a drip, drip, drip, upon the floor
of the great hall. I thrilled with a queer, realising emotion and a sense of a
very real and present danger&mdash;imminent. The 'blood-drip' had commenced.
And the grim question was now whether the Barriers could save us from whatever
had come into the huge room.</p>

<p>"Through some awful minutes the 'blood-drip' continued to fall in an
increasing rain; and presently some began to fall within the Barriers. I saw
several great drops splash and star upon the pale glowing intertwining tubes of
the Electric Pentacle; but, strangely enough, I could not trace that any fell
among us. Beyond the strange horrible noise of the 'drip,' there was no other
sound. And then, abruptly, from the boar hound over in the far corner, there
came a terrible yelling howl of agony, followed instantly by a sickening,
breaking noise, and an immediate silence. If you have ever, when out shooting,
broken a rabbit's neck, you will know the sound&mdash;in miniature! Like
lightning, the thought sprang into my brain:&mdash;IT has crossed the Pentacle.
For you will remember that I had one about each of the dogs. I thought
instantly, with a sick apprehension, of our own Barriers. There was something
in the hall with us that had passed the Barrier of the Pentacle about one of
the dogs. In the awful succeeding silence, I positively quivered. And suddenly,
one of the men behind me gave out a scream, like any woman, and bolted for the
door. He fumbled, and had it open in a moment. I yelled to the others not to
move; but they followed like sheep, and I heard them kick the candles flying,
in their panic. One of them stepped on the Electric Pentacle, and smashed it,
and there was an utter darkness. In an instant, I realised that I was
defenceless against the powers of the Unknown World, and with one savage leap I
was out of the useless Barriers, and instantly through the great doorway, and
into the night. I believe I yelled with sheer funk.</p>

<p>"The men were a little ahead of me, and I never ceased running, and neither
did they. Sometimes, I glanced back over my shoulder; and I kept glancing into
the laurels which grew all along the drive. The beastly things kept rustling,
rustling in a hollow sort of way, as though something were keeping parallel
with me, among them. The rain had stopped, and a dismal little wind kept
moaning through the grounds. It was disgusting.</p>

<p>"I caught Wentworth and the police at the lodge gate. We got outside, and
ran all the way to the village. We found old Dennis up, waiting for us, and
half the villagers to keep him company. He told us that he had known in his
'sowl' that we should come back, that is, if we came back at all; which is not
a bad rendering of his remark.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, I had brought my camera away from the house&mdash;possibly
because the strap had happened to be over my head. Yet, I did not go straight
away to develop, but sat with the rest in the bar, where we talked for some
hours, trying to be coherent about the whole horrible business.</p>

<p>"Later, however, I went up to my room and proceeded with my photography. I
was steadier now, and it was just possible, so I hoped, that the negatives
might show something.</p>

<p>"On two of the plates, I found nothing unusual: but on the third, which was
the first one that I snapped, I saw something that made me quite excited. I
examined it very carefully with a magnifying glass; then I put it to wash, and
slipped a pair of rubber half-shoes over my boots.</p>

<p>"The negative had shown me something very extraordinary, and I had made up
my mind to test the truth of what it seemed to indicate, without losing another
moment. It was no use telling anything to Wentworth and the police, until I was
certain; and, also, I believed that I stood a greater chance to succeed by
myself; though, for that matter, I do not suppose anything would have got them
up to the Manor again that night.</p>

<p>"I took my revolver, and went quietly downstairs, and into the dark. The
rain had commenced again; but that did not bother me. I walked hard. When I
came to the lodge gates, a sudden, queer instinct stopped me from going
through, and I climbed the wall into the park. I kept away from the drive, and
approached the building through the dismal, dripping laurels. You can imagine
how beastly it was. Every time a leaf rustled, I jumped.</p>

<p>"I made my way round to the back of the big house, and got in through a
little window which I had taken note of during my search; for, of course, I
knew the whole place now from roof to cellars. I went silently up the kitchen
stairs, fairly quivering with funk; and at the top, I went to the left, and
then into a long corridor that opened, through one of the doorways we had
sealed, into the big hall. I looked up it, and saw a faint flicker of light
away at the end; and I tiptoed silently towards it, holding my revolver ready.
As I came near to the open door, I heard men's voices, and then a burst of
laughing. I went on, until I could see into the hall. There were several men
there, all in a group. They were well dressed, and one, at least, I saw was
armed. They were examining my 'Barriers' against the Supernatural, with a good
deal of unkind laughter. I never felt such a fool in my life.</p>

<p>"It was plain to me that they were a gang of men who had made use of the
empty Manor, perhaps for years, for some purpose of their own; and now that
Wentworth was attempting to take possession, they were acting up to the
traditions of the place, with the view of driving him away, and keeping so
useful a place still at their disposal. But what they were, I mean whether
coiners, thieves, inventors, or what, I could not imagine.</p>

<p>"Presently, they left the Pentacle, and gathered round the living boar
hound, which seemed curiously quiet, as though it were half-drugged. There was
some talk as to whether to let the poor brute live, or not, but finally they
decided it would be good policy to kill it. I saw two of them force a twisted
loop of rope into its mouth, and the two bights of the loop were brought
together at the back of the hound's neck. Then a third thrust a thick
walking-stick through the two loops. The two men with the rope, stooped to hold
the dog, so that I could not see what was done; but the poor beast gave a
sudden awful howl, and immediately there was a repetition of the uncomfortable
breaking sound, I had heard earlier in the night, as you will remember.</p>

<p>"The men stood up and left the dog lying there, quiet enough now, as you may
suppose. For my part, I fully appreciated the calculated remorselessness which
had decided upon the animal's death, and the cold determination with which it
had been afterwards executed so neatly. I guessed that a man who might get into
the 'light' of these particular men, would be likely to come to quite as
uncomfortable an ending.</p>

<p>"A minute later, one of the men called out to the rest that they should
'shift the wires.' One of the men came towards the doorway of the corridor in
which I stood, and I ran quickly back into the darkness of the upper end. I saw
the man reach up and take something from the top of the door, and I heard the
slight, ringing jangle of steel wire.</p>

<p>"When he had gone, I ran back again, and saw the men passing, one after
another, through an opening in the stairs, formed by one of the marble steps
being raised. When the last man had vanished, the slab that made the step was
shut down, and there was not a sign of the secret door. It was the seventh step
from the bottom, as I took care to count; and a splendid idea; for it was so
solid that it did not ring hollow, even to a fairly heavy hammer, as I found
later.</p>

<p>"There is little more to tell. I got out of the house as quickly and quietly
as possible, and back to the inn. The police came without any coaxing, when
they knew the 'ghosts' were normal flesh and blood. We entered the park and the
Manor in the same way that I had done. Yet, when we tried to open the step, we
failed, and had finally to smash it. This must have warned the haunters; for
when we descended to a secret room which we found at the end of a long and
narrow passage in the thickness of the walls, we found no one.</p>

<p>"The police were horribly disgusted, as you can imagine; but for my part, I
did not care either way. I had 'laid the ghost,' as you might say, and that was
what I had set out to do. I was not particularly afraid of being laughed at by
the others; for they had all been thoroughly 'taken in'; and in the end, I had
scored, without their help.</p>

<p>"We searched right through the secret ways, and found that there was an
exit, at the end of a long tunnel, which opened in the side of a well, out in
the grounds. The ceiling of the hall was hollow, and reached by a little secret
stairway inside of the big staircase. The 'blood-drip' was merely coloured
water, dropped through minute crevices of the ornamented ceiling. How the
candles and fire were put out, I do not know; for the haunters certainly did
not act quite up to tradition, which held that the lights were put out by the
'blood-drip.' Perhaps it was too difficult to direct the fluid, without
positively squirting it, which might have given the whole thing away. The
candles and the fire may possibly have been extinguished by the agency of
carbonic acid gas; but how suspended, I have no idea.</p>

<p>"The secret hiding places were, of course, ancient. There was also, did I
tell you? a bell which they had rigged up to ring, when anyone entered the
gates at the end of the drive. If I had not climbed the wall, I should have
found nothing, for my pains; for the bell would have warned them, had I gone in
through the gateway."</p>

<p>"What was on the negative?" I asked, with much curiosity.</p>

<p>"A picture of the fine wire with which they were grappling for the hook that
held the entrance door open. They were doing it from one of the crevices in the
ceiling. They had evidently made no preparations for lifting the hook. I
suppose they never thought that anyone would make use of it, and so they had to
improvise a grapple. The wire was too fine to be seen by the amount of light we
had in the hall, but the flashlight 'picked it out.' Do you see?</p>

<p>"The opening of the inner doors was managed by wires, as you will have
guessed, which they unshipped after use, or else I should soon have found them,
when I made my search.</p>

<p>"I think I have now explained everything. The hound was killed, of course,
by the men direct. You see, they made the place as dark as possible first. Of
course, if I had managed to take a flashlight just at that instant, the whole
secret of the haunting would have been exposed. But Fate just ordered it the
other way."</p>

<p>"And the tramps?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean the two tramps who were found dead in the Manor," said
Carnacki. "Well, of course it is impossible to be sure, one way or the other.
Perhaps they happened to find out something, and were given a hypodermic. Or it
is quite as probable that they had come to the time of their dying, and just
died naturally. It is conceivable that a great many tramps had slept in the old
house, at one time or another."</p>

<p>Carnacki stood up and knocked out his pipe. We rose also, and went for our
coats and hats.</p>

<p>"Out you go!" said Carnacki, genially, using the recognised formula. And we
went out on to the Embankment, and presently through the darkness to our
various homes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>No. 3. - THE WHISTLING ROOM</h2>

<h3>[From The Idler, March 1910]</h3>

<h4>(Thomas Carnacki, the famous Investigator of "real" ghost stories, tells
here the results of his peculiar and weird investigations in The Whistling
Room)</h4>

<p>Carnacki shook a friendly fist at me, as I entered, late. Then, he opened
the door into the dining-room, and ushered the four of us&mdash;Jessop,
Arkright, Taylor and myself&mdash;in to dinner.</p>

<p>We dined well, as usual, and equally as usual, Carnacki was pretty silent
during the meal. At the end we took our wine and cigars to our accustomed
positions and Carnacki&mdash;having got himself comfortable in his big
chair&mdash;began without any preliminary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have just got back from Ireland, again," he said. "And I thought you
chaps would be interested to hear my news. Besides, I fancy I shall see the
thing clearer, after I have told it all out straight. I must tell you this,
though, at the beginning&mdash;up to the present moment I have been utterly and
completely 'stumped.' I have tumbled upon one of the most peculiar cases of
'haunting'&mdash;or devilment of some sort&mdash;that I have come against. Now
listen.</p>

<p>"I have been spending the last few weeks at Iastrae Castle, about twenty
miles north-east of Galway. I got a letter about a month ago from a Mr. Sid K.
Tassoc, who it seemed had bought the place lately, and moved in, only to find
that he had got a very peculiar piece of property.</p>

<p>"When I got there, he met me at the station, driving a jaunting-car, and
drove me up to the castle, which, by the way, he called a 'house-shanty.' I
found that he was 'pigging it' there with his boy brother and another American
who seemed to be half-servant and half-companion. It seems that all the
servants had left the place, in a body, as you might say; and now they were
managing among themselves, assisted by some day-help.</p>

<p>"The three of them got together a scratch feed, and Tassoc told me all about
the trouble, whilst we were at table. It is most extraordinary and different
from anything that I have had to do with; though that Buzzing Case was very
queer, too.</p>

<p>"Tassoc began right in the middle of his story. 'We've got a room in this
shanty,' he said, 'which has got a most infernal whistling in it; sort of
haunting it. The thing starts any time; you never know when, and it goes on
until it frightens you. All the servants have gone, as you know. It's not
ordinary whistling, and it isn't the wind. Wait till you hear it.'</p>

<p>"'We're all carrying guns,' said the boy; and slapped his coat pocket.</p>

<p>"'As bad as that?' I said; and the older brother nodded. 'It may be soft,'
he replied, 'but wait till you've heard it. Sometimes I think it's some
infernal thing and the next moment I'm just as sure that someone's playing a
trick on us.'</p>

<p>"'Why?' I asked. 'What is to be gained?'</p>

<p>"'You mean,' he said, 'that people usually have some good reason for playing
tricks as elaborate as this. Well, I'll tell you. There's a lady in this
province by the name of Miss Donnehue, who's going to be my wife, this day two
months. She's more beautiful than they make them, and so far as I can see, I've
just stuck my head into an Irish hornet's nest. There's about a score of hot
young Irishmen been courting her these two years gone, and now that I've come
along and cut them out, they feel raw against me. Do you begin to understand
the possibilities?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said. 'Perhaps I do in a vague sort of way; but I don't see how
all this affects the room?'</p>

<p>"'Like this,' he said. 'When I'd fixed it up with Miss Donnehue, I looked
out for a place, and bought this little house-shanty. Afterwards, I told
her&mdash;one evening during dinner, that I'd decided to tie up here. And then
she asked me whether I wasn't afraid of the whistling room. I told her it must
have been thrown in gratis, as I'd heard nothing about it. There were some of
her men friends present, and I saw a smile go round. I found out, after a bit
of questioning, that several people have bought this place during the last
twenty-odd years. And it was always on the market again, after a trial.'</p>

<p>"'Well, the chaps started to bait me a bit, and offered to take bets after
dinner that I'd not stay six months in the place. I looked once or twice at
Miss Donnehue, so as to be sure I was "getting the note" of the talkee-talkee;
but I could see that she didn't take it as a joke, at all. Partly, I think,
because there was a bit of a sneer in the way the men were tackling me, and
partly because she really believes there is something in this yarn of the
whistling room.'</p>

<p>"'However, after dinner, I did what I could to even things up with the
others. I nailed all their bets and screwed them down good and safe. I guess
some of them are going to be hard hit, unless I lose; which I don't mean to.
Well, there you have practically the whole yarn.'</p>

<p>"'Not quite,' I told him. 'All that I know, is that you have bought a castle
with a room in it that is in some way "queer," and that you've been doing some
betting. Also, I know that your servants have got frightened, and run away.
Tell me something about the whistling.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, that!' said Tassoc; 'that started the second night we were in. I'd had
a good look round the room, in the daytime, as you can understand; for the talk
up at Arlestrae&mdash;Miss Donnehue's place&mdash;had made me wonder a bit. But
it seems just as usual as some of the other rooms in the old wing, only perhaps
a bit more lonesome. But that may be only because of the talk about it, you
know.'</p>

<p>"'The whistling started about ten o'clock, on the second night, as I said.
Tom and I were in the library, when we heard an awfully queer whistling, coming
along the East Corridor&mdash;the room is in the East Wing, you know.'</p>

<p>"'That's that blessed ghost!' I said to Tom, and we collared the lamps off
the table, and went up to have a look. I tell you, even as we dug along the
corridor, it took me a bit in the throat, it was so beastly queer. It was a
sort of tune, in a way, but more as if a devil or some rotten thing were
laughing at you, and going to get round at your back. That's how it makes you
feel.'</p>

<p>"'When we got to the door, we didn't wait; but rushed it open; and then I
tell you the sound of the thing fairly hit me in the face. Tom said he got it
the same way&mdash;sort of felt stunned and bewildered. We looked all round,
and soon got so nervous, we just cleared out, and I locked the door.'</p>

<p>"'We came down here, and had a stiff peg each. Then we got fit again and
began to think we'd been nicely had. So we took sticks, and went out into the
grounds, thinking after all it must be some of these confounded Irishmen
working the ghost-trick on us. But there was not a leg stirring.'</p>

<p>"'We went back into the house, and walked over it, and then paid another
visit to the room. But we simply couldn't stand it. We fairly ran out, and
locked the door again. I don't know how to put it into words; but I had a
feeling of being up against something that was rottenly dangerous. You know!
We've carried our guns ever since.'</p>

<p>"'Of course, we had a real turn-out of the room next day, and the whole
house-place; and we even hunted round the grounds; but there was nothing queer.
And now I don't know what to think; except that the sensible part of me tells
me that it's some plan of these Wild Irishmen to try to take a rise out of
me.'</p>

<p>"'Done anything since?' I asked him.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said. 'Watched outside of the door of the room at nights, and
chased round the grounds, and sounded the walls and floor of the room. We've
done everything we could think of; and it's beginning to get on our nerves; so
we sent for you.'</p>

<p>"By this time we had finished eating. As we rose from the table Tassoc
suddenly called out:&mdash;'Ssh! Hark!'</p>

<p>"We were instantly silent, listening. Then I heard it, an extraordinary
hooning whistle, monstrous and inhuman, coming from far away through corridors
to my right.</p>

<p>"'By G-d!' said Tassoc, 'and it's scarcely dark yet! Collar those candles,
both of you and come along.'</p>

<p>"In a few moments, we were all out of the door and racing up the stairs.
Tassoc turned into a long corridor, and we followed, shielding our candles as
we ran. The sound seemed to fill all the passage as we drew near, until I had
the feeling that the whole air throbbed under the power of some wanton Immense
Force&mdash;a sense of an actual taint, as you might say, of monstrosity all
about us.</p>

<p>"Tassoc unlocked the door; then, giving it a push with his foot, jumped
back, and drew his revolver. As the door flew open, the sound beat out at us,
with an effect impossible to explain to one who has not heard it&mdash;with a
certain, horrible personal note in it; as if in there in the darkness you could
picture the room rocking and creaking in a mad, vile glee to its own filthy
piping and whistling and hooning. To stand there and listen, was to be stunned
by Realisation. It was as if someone showed you the mouth of a vast pit
suddenly, and said:&mdash;That's Hell. And you knew that they had spoken the
truth. Do you get it, even a little bit?</p>

<p>"I stepped a pace into the room, and held the candle over my head, and
looked quickly round. Tassoc and his brother joined me, and the man came up at
the back, and we all held our candles high. I was deafened with the shrill,
piping hoon of the whistling; and then, clear in my ear, something seemed to be
saying to me:&mdash;'Get out of here&mdash;quick! Quick! Quick!'</p>

<p>"As you chaps know, I never neglect that sort of thing. Sometimes it may be
nothing but nerves; but as you will remember, it was just such a warning that
saved me in the 'Grey Dog' Case, and in the 'Yellow Finger' Experiments; as
well as other times. Well, I turned sharp round to the others: 'Out!' I said.
'For God's sake, out quick!' And in an instant I had them into the passage.</p>

<p>"There came an extraordinary yelling scream into the hideous whistling, and
then, like a clap of thunder, an utter silence. I slammed the door, and locked
it. Then, taking the key, I looked round at the others. They were pretty white,
and I imagine I must have looked that way too. And there we stood a moment,
silent.</p>

<p>"'Come down out of this, and have some whisky,' said Tassoc, at last, in a
voice he tried to make ordinary; and he led the way. I was the back man, and I
knew we all kept looking over our shoulders. When we got downstairs, Tassoc
passed the bottle round. He took a drink, himself, and slapped his glass on to
the table. Then sat down with a thud.</p>

<p>"'That's a lovely thing to have in the house with you, isn't it!' he said.
And directly afterwards:&mdash;'What on earth made you hustle us all out like
that, Carnacki?'</p>

<p>"'Something seemed to be telling me to get out, quick,' I said. 'Sounds a
bit silly&mdash;superstitious, I know; but when you are meddling with this sort
of thing, you've got to take notice of queer fancies, and risk being laughed
at.'</p>

<p>"I told him then about the 'Grey Dog' business, and he nodded a lot to that.
'Of course,' I said, 'this may be nothing more than those would-be rivals of
yours playing some funny game; but, personally, though I'm going to keep an
open mind, I feel that there is something beastly and dangerous about this
thing.'</p>

<p>"We talked for a while longer, and then Tassoc suggested billiards, which we
played in a pretty half-hearted fashion, and all the time cocking an ear to the
door, as you might say, for sounds; but none came, and later, after coffee, he
suggested early bed, and a thorough overhaul of the room on the morrow.</p>

<p>"My bedroom was in the newer part of the castle, and the door opened into
the picture gallery. At the east end of the gallery was the entrance to the
corridor of the East Wing; this was shut off from the gallery by two old and
heavy oak doors, which looked rather odd and quaint beside the more modern
doors of the various rooms.</p>

<p>"When I reached my room, I did not go to bed; but began to unpack my
instrument-trunk, of which I had retained the key. I intended to take one or
two preliminary steps at once, in my investigation of the extraordinary
whistling.</p>

<p>"Presently, when the castle had settled into quietness, I slipped out of my
room, and across to the entrance of the great corridor. I opened one of the
low, squat doors, and threw the beam of my pocket searchlight down the passage.
It was empty, and I went through the doorway, and pushed-to the oak behind me.
Then along the great passage-way, throwing my light before and behind, and
keeping my revolver handy.</p>

<p>"I had hung a 'protection belt' of garlic round my neck, and the smell of it
seemed to fill the corridor and give me assurance; for as you all know, it is a
wonderful 'protection' against the more usual Aeiirii forms of
semi-materialisation, by which I supposed the whistling might be produced;
though at that period of my investigation I was still quite prepared to find it
due to some perfectly natural cause; for it is astonishing the enormous number
of cases that prove to have nothing abnormal in them.</p>

<p>"In addition to wearing the necklet, I had plugged my ears loosely with
garlic, and as I did not intend to stay more than a few minutes in the room, I
hoped to be safe.</p>

<p>"When I reached the door, and put my hand into my pocket for the key, I had
a sudden feeling of sickening funk. But I was not going to back out, if I could
help it. I unlocked the door and turned the handle. Then I gave the door a
sharp push with my foot, as Tassoc had done, and drew my revolver, though I did
not expect to have any use for it, really.</p>

<p>"I shone the searchlight all round the room, and then stepped inside, with a
disgustingly horrible feeling of walking slap into a waiting Danger. I stood a
few seconds, waiting, and nothing happened, and the empty room showed bare from
corner to corner. And then, you know, I realised that the room was full of an
abominable silence; can you understand that? A sort of purposeful silence, just
as sickening as any of the filthy noises the Things have power to make. Do you
remember what I told you about that 'Silent Garden' business? Well, this room
had just that same malevolent silence&mdash;the beastly quietness of a thing
that is looking at you and not seeable itself, and thinks that it has got you.
Oh, I recognised it instantly, and I whipped the top off my lantern, so as to
have light over the whole room.</p>

<p>"Then I set-to, working like fury, and keeping my glance all about me. I
sealed the two windows with lengths of human hair, right across, and sealed
them at every frame. As I worked, a queer, scarcely perceptible tenseness stole
into the air of the place, and the silence seemed, if you can understand me, to
grow more solid. I knew then that I had no business there without 'full
protection'; for I was practically certain that this was no mere Aeiirii
development, but one of the worse forms, as the Saiitii; like that 'Grunting
Man' case&mdash;you know.</p>

<p>"I finished the window, and hurried over to the great fireplace. This is a
huge affair, and has a queer gallows-iron, I think they are called, projecting
from the back of the arch. I sealed the opening with seven human
hairs&mdash;the seventh crossing the six others.</p>

<p>"Then, just as I was making an end, a low, mocking whistle grew in the room.
A cold, nervous prickling went up my spine, and round my forehead from the
back. The hideous sound filled all the room with an extraordinary, grotesque
parody of human whistling, too gigantic to be human&mdash;as if something
gargantuan and monstrous made the sounds softly. As I stood there a last
moment, pressing down the final seal, I had little doubt but that I had come
across one of those rare and horrible cases of the Inanimate reproducing the
functions of the Animate. I made a grab for my lamp, and went quickly to the
door, looking over my shoulder, and listening for the thing that I expected. It
came, just as I got my hand upon the handle&mdash;a squeal of incredible,
malevolent anger, piercing through the low hooning of the whistling. I dashed
out, slamming the door and locking it.</p>

<p>"I leant a little against the opposite wall of the corridor, feeling rather
funny; for it had been a hideously narrow squeak ...'thyr be noe sayfetie to be
gained bye gayrds of holieness when the monyster hath pow'r to speak throe
woode and stoene.' So runs the passage in the Sigsand MS., and I proved it in
that 'Nodding Door' business. There is no protection against this particular
form of monster, except possibly for a fractional period of time; for it can
reproduce itself in, or take to its purposes, the very protective material
which you may use, and has power to 'forme wythine the pentycle,' though not
immediately. There is, of course, the possibility of the Unknown Last Line of
the Saaamaaa Ritual being uttered; but it is too uncertain to count upon, and
the danger is too hideous; and even then it has no power to protect for more
than 'maybe fyve beats of the harte,' as the Sigsand has it.</p>

<p>"Inside of the room, there was now a constant, meditative, hooning
whistling; but presently this ceased, and the silence seemed worse; for there
is such a sense of hidden mischief in a silence.</p>

<p>"After a little, I sealed the door with crossed hairs, and then cleared off
down the great passage, and so to bed.</p>

<p>"For a long time I lay awake; but managed eventually to get some sleep. Yet,
about two o'clock I was waked by the hooning whistling of the room coming to
me, even through the closed doors. The sound was tremendous, and seemed to beat
through the whole house with a presiding sense of terror. As if (I remember
thinking) some monstrous giant had been holding mad carnival with itself at the
end of that great passage.</p>

<p>"I got up and sat on the edge of the bed, wondering whether to go along and
have a look at the seal; and suddenly there came a thump on my door, and Tassoc
walked in, with his dressing-gown over his pyjamas.</p>

<p>"'I thought it would have waked, you so I came along to have a talk,' he
said. 'I can't sleep. Beautiful! Isn't it!'</p>

<p>"'Extraordinary!' I said, and tossed him my case.</p>

<p>"He lit a cigarette, and we sat and talked for about an hour; and all the
time that noise went on, down at the end of the big corridor.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, Tassoc stood up:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Let's take our guns, and go and examine the brute,' he said, and turned
towards the door.</p>

<p>"'No!' I said. 'By Jove&mdash;NO! I can't say anything definite yet; but I
believe that room is about as dangerous as it well can be.'</p>

<p>"'Haunted&mdash;really haunted?' he asked, keenly and without any of his
frequent banter.</p>

<p>"I told him, of course, that I could not say a definite yes or no to such a
question; but that I hoped to be able to make a statement soon. Then I gave him
a little lecture on the False Re-Materialisation of the Animate-Force through
the Inanimate-Inert. He began then to see the particular way in which the room
might be dangerous, if it were really the subject of a manifestation.</p>

<p>"About an hour later, the whistling ceased quite suddenly, and Tassoc went
off again to bed. I went back to mine, also, and eventually got another spell
of sleep.</p>

<p>"In the morning, I went along to the room. I found the seals on the door
intact. Then I went in. The window seals and the hair were all right; but the
seventh hair across the great fireplace was broken. This set me thinking. I
knew that it might, very possibly, have snapped, through my having tensioned it
too highly; but then, again, it might have been broken by something else. Yet,
it was scarcely possible that a man, for instance, could have passed between
the six unbroken hairs; for no one would ever have noticed them, entering the
room that way, you see; but just walked through them, ignorant of their very
existence.</p>

<p>"I removed the other hairs, and the seals. Then I looked up the chimney. It
went up straight, and I could see blue sky at the top. It was a big, open flue,
and free from any suggestion of hiding places or corners. Yet, of course, I did
not trust to any such casual examination, and after breakfast, I put on my
overalls and climbed to the very top, sounding all the way; but I found
nothing.</p>

<p>"Then I came down and went over the whole of the room&mdash;floor, ceiling,
and walls, mapping them out in six-inch squares, and sounding with both hammer
and probe. But there was nothing abnormal.</p>

<p>"Afterwards, I made a three-weeks' search of the whole castle, in the same
thorough way; but found nothing. I went even further, then; for at night, when
the whistling commenced, I made a microphone test. You see, if the whistling
were mechanically produced, this test would have made evident to me the working
of the machinery, if there were any such concealed within the walls. It
certainly was an up-to-date method of examination, as you must allow.</p>

<p>"Of course I did not think that any of Tassoc's rivals had fixed up any
mechanical contrivance; but I thought it just possible that there had been some
such thing for producing the whistling, made away back in the years, perhaps
with the intention of giving the room a reputation that would ensure its being
free of inquisitive folk. You see what I mean? Well, of course, it was just
possible, if this were the case, that someone knew the secret of the machinery,
and was utilising the knowledge to play this devil of a prank on Tassoc. The
microphone test of the walls would certainly have made this known to me, as I
have said; but there was nothing of the sort in the castle; so that I had
practically no doubt at all now, but that it was a genuine case of what is
popularly termed 'haunting.'</p>

<p>"All this time, every night, and sometimes most of each night, the hooning
whistling of the room was intolerable. It was as if an Intelligence there, knew
that steps were being taken against it, and piped and hooned in a sort of mad,
mocking contempt. I tell you, it was as extraordinary as it was horrible. Time
after time, I went along&mdash;tiptoeing noiselessly on stockinged
feet&mdash;to the sealed floor (for I always kept the room sealed). I went at
all hours of the night, and often the whistling, inside, would seem to change
to a brutally malignant note, as though the half-animate monster saw me plainly
through the shut door. And all the time the shrieking, hooning whistling would
fill the whole corridor, so that I used to feel a precious lonely chap, messing
about there with one of Hell's mysteries.</p>

<p>"And every morning, I would enter the room and examine the different hairs
and seals. You see, after the first week, I had stretched parallel hairs all
along the walls of the room, and along the ceiling; but over the floor, which
was of polished stone, I had set out little, colourless wafers, tacky-side
uppermost. Each wafer was numbered, and they were arranged after a definite
plan, so that I should be able to trace the exact movements of any living thing
that went across the floor.</p>

<p>"You will see that no material being or creature could possibly have entered
that room, without leaving many signs to tell me all about it. But nothing was
ever disturbed, and I began to think that I should have to risk an attempt to
stay a night in the room, in the Electric Pentacle. Yet, mind you, I knew that
it would be a crazy thing to do; but I was getting stumped, and ready to try
anything.</p>

<p>"Once, about midnight, I did break the seal on the door, and have a quick
look in; but, I tell you, the whole room gave one mad yell, and seemed to come
towards me in a great belly of shadows, as if the walls had bellied in towards
me. Of course, that must have been fancy. Anyway, the yell was sufficient, and
I slammed the door, and locked it, feeling a bit weak down my spine. You know
the feeling.</p>

<p>"And then, when I had got to that state of readiness for anything, I made
what, at first, I thought was something of a discovery. It was about one in the
morning, and I was walking slowly round the castle, keeping in the soft grass.
I had come under the shadow of the East Front, and far above me, I could hear
the vile, hooning whistling of the room, up in the darkness of the unlit wing.
Then, suddenly, a little in front of me, I heard a man's voice speaking low,
but evidently in glee:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'By George! You chaps; but I wouldn't care to bring a wife home to that!'
it said, in the tone of the cultured Irish.</p>

<p>"Someone started to reply; but there came a sharp exclamation, and then a
rush, and I heard footsteps running in all directions. Evidently, the men had
spotted me.</p>

<p>"For a few seconds, I stood there, feeling an awful ass. After all, they
were at the bottom of the haunting! Do you see what a big fool it made me seem?
I had no doubt but that they were some of Tassoc's rivals; and here I had been
feeling in every bone that I had hit on a real, bad, genuine case! And then,
you know, there came the memory of hundreds of details, that made me just as
much in doubt again. Anyway, whether it was natural, or ab-natural, there was a
great deal yet to be cleared up.</p>

<p>"I told Tassoc, next morning, what I had discovered, and through the whole
of every night, for five nights, we kept a close watch round the East Wing; but
there was never a sign of anyone prowling about; and all this time, almost from
evening to dawn, that grotesque whistling would hoon incredibly, far above us
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"On the morning after the fifth night, I received a wire from here, which
brought me home by the next boat. I explained to Tassoc that I was simply bound
to come away for a few days; but told him to keep up the watch round the
castle. One thing I was very careful to do, and that was to make him absolutely
promise never to go into the room, between sunset and sunrise. I made it clear
to him that we knew nothing definite yet, one way or the other; and if the room
were what I had first thought it to be, it might be a lot better for him to die
first, than enter it after dark.</p>

<p>"When I got here, and had finished my business, I thought you chaps would be
interested; and also I wanted to get it all spread out clear in my mind; so I
rang you up. I am going over again tomorrow, and when I get back, I ought to
have something pretty extraordinary to tell you. By the way, there is a curious
thing I forgot to tell you. I tried to get a phonographic record of the
whistling; but it simply produced no impression on the wax at all. That is one
of the things that has made me feel queer, I can tell you. Another
extraordinary thing is that the microphone will not magnify the
sound&mdash;will not even transmit it; seems to take no account of it, and acts
as if it were non-existent. I am absolutely and utterly stumped, up to the
present. I am a wee bit curious to see whether any of you dear clever heads can
make daylight of it. I cannot&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Good-night, all," he said, and began to usher us out abruptly, but without
offence, into the night.</p>

<p>A fortnight later, he dropped us each a card, and you can imagine that I was
not late this time. When we arrived, Carnacki took us straight in to dinner,
and when we had finished, and all made ourselves comfortable, he began again,
where he had left off:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now just listen quietly; for I have got something pretty queer to tell you.
I got back late at night, and I had to walk up to the castle, as I had not
warned them that I was coming. It was bright moonlight; so that the walk was
rather a pleasure, than otherwise. When I got there, the whole place was in
darkness, and I thought I would go round outside, to see whether Tassoc or his
brother was keeping watch. But I could not find them anywhere, and concluded
that they had got tired of it, and gone off to bed.</p>

<p>"As I returned across the front of the East Wing, I caught the hooning
whistling of the room, coming down strangely through the stillness of the
night. It had a queer note in it, I remember&mdash;low and constant, queerly
meditative. I looked up at the window, bright in the moonlight, and got a
sudden thought to bring a ladder from the stable-yard, and try to get a look
into the room, through the window.</p>

<p>"With this notion, I hunted round at the back of the castle, among the
straggle of offices, and presently found a long, fairly light ladder; though it
was heavy enough for one, goodness knows! I thought at first that I should
never get it reared. I managed at last and let the ends rest very quietly
against the wall a little below the sill of the larger window. Then, going
silently, I went up the ladder. Presently I had my face above the sill and was
looking in, alone with the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Of course, the queer whistling sounded louder up there; but it still
conveyed that peculiar sense of something whistling quietly to itself&mdash;can
you understand? Though, for all the meditative lowness of the note, the
horrible, gargantuan quality was distinct&mdash;a mighty parody of the human,
as if I stood there, and listened to the whistling from the lips of a monster
with a man's soul.</p>

<p>"And then, you know, I saw something. The floor in the middle of the huge,
empty room, was puckered upwards in the centre into a strange, soft-looking
mound, parted at the top into an ever-changing hole, that pulsated to that
great, gentle hooning. At times, as I watched, I saw the heaving of the
indented mound, gap across with a queer, inward suction, as with the drawing of
an enormous breath; then the thing would dilate and pout once more to the
incredible melody. And suddenly, as I stared, dumb, it came to me that the
thing was living. I was looking at two enormous, blackened lips, blistered and
brutal, there in the pale moonlight...</p>

<p>"Abruptly, they bulged out to a vast pouting mound of force and sound,
stiffened and swollen, and hugely massive and clean-cut in the moonbeams. And a
great sweat lay heavy on the vast upper lip. In the same moment of time, the
whistling had burst into a mad screaming note, that seemed to stun me, even
where I stood, outside of the window. And then, the following moment, I was
staring blankly at the solid, undisturbed floor of the room&mdash;smooth,
polished stone flooring, from wall to wall; and there was an absolute
silence.</p>

<p>"You can picture me staring into the quiet room, and knowing what I knew. I
felt like a sick, frightened kid, and I wanted to slide quietly down the
ladder, and run away. But in that very instant, I heard Tassoc's voice calling
to me from within the room, for help, help. My God! but I got such an awful
dazed feeling; and I had a vague, bewildered notion that, after all, it was the
Irishmen who had got him in there, and were taking it out of him. And then the
call came again, and I burst the window, and jumped in to help him. I had a
confused idea that the call had come from within the shadow of the great
fireplace, and I raced across to it; but there was no one there.</p>

<p>"'Tassoc!' I shouted, and my voice went empty-sounding round the great
apartment; and then, in a flash, I knew that Tassoc had never called. I whirled
round, sick with fear, towards the window, and as I did so, a frightful,
exultant whistling scream burst through the room. On my left the end wall had
bellied-in towards me, in a pair of gargantuan lips, black and utterly
monstrous, to within a yard of my face. I fumbled for a mad instant at my
revolver; not for it, but myself, for the danger was a thousand times worse
than death. And then, suddenly, the Unknown Last Line of the Saaamaaa Ritual
was whispered quite audibly in the room. Instantly, the thing happened that I
have known once before. There came a sense as of dust falling continually and
monotonously, and I knew that my life hung uncertain and suspended for a flash,
in a brief, reeling vertigo of unseeable things, Then that ended, and I knew
that I might live. My soul and body blended again, and life and power came to
me. I dashed furiously at the window, and hurled myself out head-foremost, for
I can tell you that I had stopped being afraid of death. I crashed down on to
the ladder, and slithered, grabbing and grabbing; and so came some way or other
alive to the bottom. And there I sat in the soft, wet grass, with the moonlight
all about me; and far above, through the broken window of the room, there was a
low whistling.</p>

<p>"That is the chief of it. I was not hurt, and I went round to the front, and
knocked Tassoc up. When they let me in, we had a long yarn, over some good
whisky&mdash;for I was shaken to pieces&mdash;, and I explained things as much
as I could. I told Tassoc that the room would have to come down, and every
fragment of it be burned in a blast-furnace, erected within a pentacle. He
nodded. There was nothing to say. Then I went to bed.</p>

<p>"We turned a small army on to the work, and within ten days, that lovely
thing had gone up in smoke, and what was left was calcined, and clean.</p>

<p>"It was when the workmen were stripping the panelling, that I got hold of a
sound notion of the beginnings of that beastly development. Over the great
fireplace, after the great oak panels had been torn down, I found that there
was let into the masonry a scrollwork of stone, with on it an old inscription,
in ancient Celtic, that here in this room was burned Dian Tiansay, Jester of
King Alzof, who made the Song of Foolishness upon King Ernore of the Seventh
Castle.</p>

<p>"When I got the translation clear, I gave it to Tassoc. He was tremendously
excited; for he knew the old tale, and took me down to the library to look at
an old parchment that gave the story in detail. Afterwards, I found that the
incident was well-known about the countryside; but always regarded more as a
legend, than as history. And no one seemed ever to have dreamt that the old
East Wing of Iastrae Castle was the remains of the ancient Seventh Castle.</p>

<p>"From the old parchment, I gathered that there had been a pretty dirty job
done, away back in the years. It seems that King Alzof and King Ernore had been
enemies by birthright, as you might say truly; but that nothing more than a
little raiding had occurred on either side for years, until Dian Tiansay made
the Song of Foolishness upon King Ernore, and sang it before King Alzof; and so
greatly was it appreciated that King Alzof gave the jester one of his ladies,
to wife.</p>

<p>"Presently, all the people of the land had come to know the song, and so it
came at last to King Ernore, who was so angered that he made war upon his old
enemy, and took and burned him and his castle; but Dian Tiansay, the jester, he
brought with him to his own place, and having torn his tongue out because of
the song which he had made and sung, he imprisoned him in the room in the East
Wing (which was evidently used for unpleasant purposes), and the jester's wife,
he kept for himself, having a fancy for her prettiness.</p>

<p>"But one night, Dian Tiansay's wife was not to be found, and in the morning
they discovered her lying dead in her husband's arms and he sitting, whistling
the Song of Foolishness, for he had no longer the power to sing it.</p>

<p>"Then they roasted Dian Tiansay, in the great fireplace&mdash;probably from
that self-same 'gallows-iron' which I have already mentioned. And until he
died, Dian Tiansay 'ceased not to whistle' the Song of Foolishness, which he
could no longer sing. But afterwards, 'in that room,' there was often heard at
night the sound of something whistling; and there 'grew a power in that room,'
so that none dared to sleep in it. And presently, it would seem, the King went
to another castle; for the whistling troubled him.</p>

<p>"There you have it all. Of course, that is only a rough rendering of the
translation from the parchment. It's a bit quaint! Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, answering for the lot. "But how did the thing grow to such a
tremendous manifestation?"</p>

<p>"One of those cases of continuity of thought producing a positive action
upon the immediate surrounding material," replied Carnacki. "The development
must have been going forward through centuries, to have produced such a
monstrosity. It was a true instance of Saiitii Manifestation, which I can best
explain by likening it to a living spiritual fungus, which involves the very
structure of the aether-fibre itself, and, of course, in so doing, acquires an
essential control over the 'material-substance' involved in it. It is
impossible to make it plainer in a few words."</p>

<p>"What broke the seventh hair?" asked Taylor.</p>

<p>But Carnacki did not know. He thought it was probably nothing but being too
severely tensioned. He also explained that they found out that the men who had
run away had not been up to mischief; but had come over secretly, merely to
hear the whistling, which, indeed, had suddenly become the talk of the whole
countryside.</p>

<p>"One other thing," said Arkright, "have you any idea what governs the use of
the Unknown Last Line of the Saaamaaa Ritual? I know, of course, that it was
used by the Ab-human Priests in the Incantation of the Raaee; but what used it
on your behalf, and what made it?"</p>

<p>"You had better read Harzam's Monograph, and my Addenda to it, on Astral and
Astarral Co-ordination and Interference," said Carnacki. "It is an
extraordinary subject, and I can only say here that the human-vibration may not
be insulated from the astarral (as is always believed to be the case, in
interferences by the Ab-human), without immediate action being taken by those
Forces which govern the spinning of the outer circle. In other words, it is
being proved, time after time, that there is some inscrutable Protective Force
constantly intervening between the human-soul (not the body, mind you) and the
Outer Monstrosities. Am I clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," I replied. "And you believe that the room had become the
material expression of the ancient Jester&mdash;that his soul, rotted with
hatred, had bred into a monster&mdash;eh?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carnacki, nodding. "I think you've put my thought rather neatly.
It is a queer coincidence that Miss Donnehue is supposed to be descended (so I
have heard since) from the same King Ernore. It makes one think some rather
curious thoughts, doesn't it? The marriage coming on, and the room waking to
fresh life. If she had gone into that room, ever...eh? IT had waited a long
time. Sins of the fathers. Yes, I've thought of that. They're to be married
next week, and I am to be best man, which is a thing I hate. And he won his
bets, rather! Just think, if ever she had gone into that room. Pretty horrible,
eh?"</p>

<p>He nodded his head, grimly, and we four nodded back. Then he rose and took
us collectively to the door, and presently thrust us forth in friendly fashion
on to the Embankment and into the fresh night air.</p>

<p>"Good night," we all called back, and went to our various homes. If she had,
eh? If she had? That is what I kept thinking.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>No. 4. - THE HORSE OF THE INVISIBLE</h2>

<h3>[From The Idler, April 1910]</h3>

<h4>(Thomas Carnacki, the famous Investigator of "real" ghost stories, tells
here the details of a peculiarly frightening experience)</h4>

<p>When I reached 427, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, I found Carnacki sitting alone. As
I came into the room, he rose with a perceptibly stiff movement, and extended
his left hand. His face seemed to be badly scarred and bruised, and his right
hand was bandaged. He shook hands and offered me his paper, which I refused.
Then he passed me a handful of photographs, and returned to his reading.</p>

<p>Now, that is just Carnacki. Not a word had come from him, and not a question
from me. He would tell us all about it later. I spent about half an hour,
looking at the photographs, which were chiefly "snaps" (some by flashlight) of
an extraordinarily pretty girl; though in some of the photographs it was
wonderful that her prettiness was so evident, for so frightened and startled
was her expression, that it was difficult not to believe that she had been
photographed in the presence of some imminent and overwhelming danger.</p>

<p>The bulk of the photographs were of interiors of different rooms and
passages, and in every one the girl might be seen, either full length in the
distance, or closer, with, perhaps, only a hand or arm, or portion of the head
or dress included in the photograph. All of these had evidently been taken with
some definite aim, that did not have for its first purpose the picturing of the
girl, but obviously of her surroundings; and they made me very curious, as you
can imagine.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the pile, however, I came upon something definitely
extraordinary. It was a photograph of the girl, standing abrupt and clear in
the great blaze of a flashlight, as was plain to be seen. Her face was turned a
little upward, as if she had been frightened suddenly by some noise. Directly
above her, as though half-formed and coming down out of the shadows, was the
shape of a single, enormous hoof.</p>

<p>I examined this photograph for a long time, without understanding it more
than that it had probably to do with some queer case in which Carnacki was
interested.</p>

<p>When Jessop, Arkright, and Taylor came in, Carnacki quietly held out his
hand for the photographs, which I returned in the same spirit, and afterwards
we all went in to dinner. When we had spent a quiet but profitable hour at the
table, we pulled our chairs round, and made ourselves snug; and Carnacki
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been North," he said, speaking slowly and painfully, between puffs at
his pipe. "Up to Hisgins of East Lancashire. It has been a pretty strange
business all round, as I fancy you chaps will think, when I have finished. I
knew, before I went, something about the 'horse story,' as I have heard it
called; but I never thought of it as coming my way, somehow. Also I know now
that I never considered it seriously&mdash;in spite of my rule always to keep
an open mind. Funny creatures, we humans!</p>

<p>"Well, I got a wire, asking for an appointment, which of course told me that
there was some trouble. On the date I fixed, old Captain Hisgins himself came
up to see me. He told me a great many new details about the horse story;
though, naturally, I had always known the main points, and understood that if
the first child were a girl, that girl would be haunted by the Horse, during
her courtship.</p>

<p>"It is, as you can see, an extraordinary story, and though I have always
known about it, I have never thought it to be anything more than old-time
legend, as I have already hinted. You see, for seven generations the Hisgins
family have had men children for their first-born, and even the Hisgins
themselves have long considered the tale to be little more than a myth.</p>

<p>"To come to the present, the eldest child of the reigning family is a girl,
and she has been often teased and warned in jest by her friends and relations
that she is the first girl to be the eldest for seven generations, and that she
would have to keep her men friends at arm's length, or go into a nunnery, if
she hoped to escape the haunting. And this, I think, shows us how thoroughly
the tale had grown to be considered as nothing worthy of the least serious
thought. Don't you think so?</p>

<p>"Two months ago, Miss Hisgins became engaged to Beaumont, a young Naval
officer, and on the evening of the very day of the engagement, before it was
even formally announced, a most extraordinary thing happened, which resulted in
Captain Hisgins making the appointment, and my ultimately going down to their
place to look into the thing.</p>

<p>"From the old family records and papers that were trusted to me, I found
that there could be no possible doubt that prior to something like a hundred
and fifty years ago there were some very extraordinary and disagreeable
coincidences, to put the thing in the least emotional way. In the whole of the
two centuries prior to that date, there were five first-born girls, out of a
total of seven generations of the family. Each of these girls grew up to
maidenhood, and each became engaged, and each one died during the period of
engagement, two by suicide, one by falling from a window, one from a "broken
heart" (presumably heart failure, owing to sudden shock through fright). The
fifth girl was killed one evening in the park round the house; but just how,
there seemed to be no exact knowledge; only that there was an impression that
she had been kicked by a horse. She was dead, when found.</p>

<p>"Now, you see, all of these deaths might be attributed in a way&mdash;even
the suicides&mdash;to natural causes, I mean, as distinct from supernatural.
You see? Yet, in every case, the maidens had undoubtedly suffered some
extraordinary and terrifying experiences during their various courtships, for
in all of the records there was mention either of the neighing of an unseen
horse, or of the sounds of an invisible horse galloping, as well as many other
peculiar and quite inexplicable manifestations. You begin to understand now, I
think, just how extraordinary a business it was that I was asked to look
into.</p>

<p>"I gathered from the records that the haunting of the girls was so constant
and horrible that two of the girls' lovers fairly ran away from their
lady-loves. And I think it was this, more than anything else, that made me feel
that there had been something more in it, than a mere succession of
uncomfortable coincidences.</p>

<p>"I got hold of these facts, before I had been many hours in the house; and
after this I went pretty carefully into the details of the things that happened
on the night of Miss Hisgins' engagement to Beaumont. It seems that as the two
of them were going through the big lower corridor, just after dusk and before
the lamps had been lighted, there had been a sudden, horrible neighing in the
corridor, close to them. Immediately afterwards, Beaumont received a tremendous
blow or kick, which broke his right forearm. Then the rest of the family came
running, to know what was wrong, and the servants. Lights were brought, and the
corridor and, afterwards, the whole house searched; but nothing unusual was
found.</p>

<p>"You can imagine the excitement in the house, and the half-incredulous,
half-believing talk about the old legend. Later on, in the middle of the night,
the old Captain was awakened by the sound of a great horse galloping round and
round the house.</p>

<p>"Several times after this, both Beaumont and the girl said that they had
heard the sounds of hoofs near to them, after dusk, in several of the rooms and
corridors.</p>

<p>"Three nights later, Beaumont was awakened by a strange neighing in the
night-time, seeming to come from the direction of his sweetheart's bedroom. He
ran hurriedly for her father, and the two of them raced to her room. They found
her awake, and ill with sheer terror, having been awakened by the neighing,
seemingly close to her bed.</p>

<p>"The night before I arrived, there had been a fresh happening, and they were
all in a frightfully nervy state, as you can imagine.</p>

<p>"I spent most of the first day, as I have hinted, in getting hold of
details; but after dinner, I slacked off, and played billiards all the evening
with Beaumont and Miss Hisgins. We stopped about ten o'clock, and had coffee,
and I got Beaumont to give me full particulars about the thing that happened
the night before.</p>

<p>"He and Miss Hisgins had been sitting quietly in her aunt's boudoir, whilst
the old lady chaperoned them, behind a book. It was growing dusk, and the lamp
was at her end of the table. The rest of the house was not yet lit, as the
evening had come earlier than usual.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that the door into the hall was open, and suddenly the girl
said: 'S'ush! what's that?'</p>

<p>"They both listened, and then Beaumont heard it&mdash;the sound of a horse,
outside the front door.</p>

<p>"'Your father?' he suggested; but she reminded him that her father was not
riding.</p>

<p>"Of course, they were both ready to feel queer, as you can suppose; but
Beaumont made an effort to shake this off, and went into the hall to see
whether anyone was at the entrance. It was pretty dark in the hall, and he
could see the glass panels of the inner draught-door, clear-cut in the darkness
of the hall. He walked over to the glass, and looked through into the drive
beyond; but there was nothing in sight.</p>

<p>"He felt nervous and puzzled, and opened the inner door and went out on to
the carriage-circle. Almost directly afterwards, the great hall door swung to
with a crash behind him. He told me that he had a sudden awful feeling of
having been trapped in some way&mdash;that is how he put it. He whirled round,
and gripped the door handle; but something seemed to be holding it with a vast
grip on the other side. Then, before it could be fixed in his mind that this
was so, he was able to turn the handle, and open the door.</p>

<p>"He paused a moment in the doorway, and peered into the hall; for he had
hardly steadied his mind sufficiently to know whether he was really frightened
or not. Then he heard his sweetheart blow him a kiss out of the greyness of the
big, unlit hall, and he knew that she had followed him, from the boudoir. He
blew her a kiss back, and stepped inside the doorway, meaning to go to her. And
then, suddenly, in a flash of sickening knowledge, he knew that it was not his
sweetheart who had blown him that kiss. He knew that something was trying to
tempt him alone into the darkness, and that the girl had never left the
boudoir. He jumped back, and in the same instant of time, he heard the kiss
again, nearer to him. He called out at the top of his voice:&mdash;'Mary, stay
in the boudoir. Don't move out of the boudoir until I come to you.' He heard
her call something in reply, from the boudoir, and then he had struck a clump
of a dozen or so matches, and was holding them above his head, and looking
round the hall. There was no one in it; but even as the matches burned out,
there came the sounds of a great horse galloping down the empty drive.</p>

<p>"Now, you see, both he and the girl had heard the sounds of the horse
galloping; but when I questioned more closely, I found that the aunt had heard
nothing; though, it is true, she is a bit deaf, and she was further back in the
room. Of course, both he and Miss Hisgins had been in an extremely nervous
state, and ready to hear anything. The door might have been slammed by a sudden
puff of wind, owing to some inner door being opened; and as for the grip on the
handle, that may have been nothing more than the sneck catching.</p>

<p>"With regard to the kisses and the sounds of the horse galloping, I pointed
out that these might have seemed ordinary enough sounds, if they had been only
cool enough to reason. As I told him, and as he knew, the sounds of a horse
galloping carry a long way on the wind; so that what he had heard might have
been nothing more than a horse being ridden, some distance away. And as for the
kiss, plenty of quiet noises&mdash;the rustle of a paper or a leaf&mdash;have a
somewhat similar sound, especially if one is in an overstrung condition, and
imagining things.</p>

<p>"I was preaching this little sermon on common sense, versus hysteria, as we
put out the lights and left the billiard room. But neither Beaumont nor Miss
Hisgins would agree that there had been any fancy on their parts.</p>

<p>"We had come out of the billiard room, by this time, and were going along
the passage; and I was still doing my best to make both of them see the
ordinary, commonplace possibilities of the happening, when what killed my pig,
as the saying goes, was the sound of a hoof in the dark billiard room, we had
just left.</p>

<p>"I felt the 'creep' come on me in a flash, up my spine and over the back of
my head. Miss Hisgins whooped like a child with whooping-cough, and ran up the
passage, giving little gasping screams. Beaumont, however, ripped round on his
heels, and jumped back a couple of yards. I gave back too, a bit, as you can
understand.</p>

<p>"'There it is,' he said, in a low, breathless voice. 'Perhaps you'll believe
now.'</p>

<p>"'There's certainly something,' I whispered back, and never taking my gaze
off the closed door of the billiard room.</p>

<p>"'H'sh!' he muttered, 'There it is again.'</p>

<p>"There was a sound like a great horse pacing round and round the billiard
room, with slow, deliberate steps. A horrible cold fright took me, so that it
seemed impossible to take a full breath, you know the feeling; and then I know
we must have walked backwards, for we found ourselves suddenly at the opening
of the long passage.</p>

<p>"We stopped there, and listened. The sounds went on steadily with a horrible
sort of deliberateness; as if the brute were taking a sort of malicious gusto
in walking about all over the room in which we had just been. Do you understand
just what I mean?</p>

<p>"Then there was a pause, and a long time of absolute quiet, except for an
excited whispering from some of the people down in the big hall. The sound came
plainly up the wide stair-way. I fancy they were gathered round Miss Hisgins,
with some notion of protecting her.</p>

<p>"I should think Beaumont and I stood there, at the end of the passage, for
about five minutes, listening for any noise in the billiard room. Then I
realised what a horrible funk I was in, and I said to him:&mdash;'I'm going to
see what's there.'</p>

<p>"'So'm I,' he answered. He was pretty white; but he had heaps of pluck. I
told him to wait one instant, and I made a dash into my bedroom, and got my
camera and flashlight. I slipped my revolver into my right-hand pocket and a
knuckle-duster over my left fist, where it was ready, and yet would not stop me
from being able to work my flashlight.</p>

<p>"Then I ran back to Beaumont. He held out his right hand, to show me that he
had his pistol, and I nodded; but whispered to him not to be too quick to
shoot, as there might be some silly practical joking at work, after all. He had
got a lamp from a bracket in the upper hall, which he was holding in the crook
of his damaged arm, so that we had a good light. Then we went down the passage,
towards the billiard room; and you can imagine that we were a pretty nervous
couple.</p>

<p>"All this time, there had not been a sound; but abruptly when we were within
perhaps a couple of yards of the door, we heard the sudden clumping of a hoof
on the solid parquet-floor of the billiard room. In the instant afterward, it
seemed to me that the whole place shook beneath the ponderous hoof-falls of
some huge thing, coming towards the door. Both Beaumont and I gave back a pace
or two, and then realised, and hung on to our courage, as you might say, and
waited. The great tread came right up to the door and then stopped, and there
was an instant of absolute silence, except that, so far as I was concerned, the
pulse in my throat and temples almost deafened me.</p>

<p>"I daresay we waited quite half a minute, and then came the further restless
clumping of a great hoof. Immediately afterwards, the sounds came right on, as
if some invisible thing passed through the closed door, and the passage, and I
know that I spread myself stiff against the wall. The clungk, clunck, clungk,
clunck, of the great hoof-falls passed right between us, and slowly and with
deadly deliberateness, down the passage. I heard them through a haze of
blood-beats in my ears and temples, and my body extraordinarily rigid and
pringling and breathless. I stood for a little time like this, my head turned,
so that I should see up the passage. I was conscious only that there was a
hideous danger abroad. Do you understand?</p>

<p>"And then, suddenly, my pluck came back to me. I was aware that the noise of
the hoof-beats sounded near the other end of the passage. I twisted quickly,
and got my camera to bear, and snapped the flashlight. Immediately afterwards,
Beaumont let fly a storm of shots down the passage, and began to run,
shouting:&mdash;'It's after Mary. Run! Run!'</p>

<p>"He rushed down the passage, and I after him. We came out on the main
landing and heard the sound of a hoof on the stairs, and after that, nothing.
And from thence, onwards, nothing.</p>

<p>"Down, below us in the big hall, I could see a number of the household round
Miss Hisgins, who seemed to have fainted; and there were several of the
servants clumped together a little way off, staring up at the main landing, and
no one saying a single word. And about some twenty steps up the stairs was old
Captain Hisgins with a drawn sword in his hand, where he had halted just below
the last hoof-sound. I think I never saw anything finer than the old man
standing there between his daughter and that infernal thing.</p>

<p>"I daresay you can understand the queer feeling of horror I had at passing
that place on the stairs where the sounds had ceased. It was as if the monster
were still standing there, invisible. And the peculiar thing was that we never
heard another sound of the hoof, either up or down the stairs.</p>

<p>"After they had taken Miss Hisgins to her room, I sent word that I should
follow so soon as they were ready for me. And, presently, when a message came
to tell me that I could come any time, I asked her father to give me a hand
with my instrument box, and between us we carried it into the girl's bedroom. I
had the bed pulled well out into the middle of the room; after which I erected
the electric pentacle round the bed. Then I directed that lamps should be
placed round the room, but that on no account must any light be made within the
pentacle, neither must anyone pass in or out. The girl's mother I had placed
within the pentacle and directed that her maid should sit without, ready to
carry any message, so as to make sure that Mrs. Hisgins did not have to leave
the pentacle. I suggested also, that the girl's father should stay the night in
the room, and that he had better be armed.</p>

<p>"When I left the room, I found Beaumont waiting outside the door, in a
miserable state of anxiety. I told him what I had done, and explained to him
that Miss Hisgins was probably perfectly safe within the 'protection'; but
that, in addition to her father remaining the night in the room, I intended to
stand guard at the door. I told him that I should like him to keep me company,
for I knew that he could never sleep, and I should not be sorry to have a
companion. Also, I wanted to have him under my own observation; for there was
no doubt but that he was actually in greater danger than the girl. At least,
that was my opinion; and is still, as I think you will agree later.</p>

<p>"I asked him whether he would object to my drawing a pentacle round him, for
the night, and got him to agree; but I saw that he did not know whether to be
superstitious about it, or to regard it more as a piece of foolish mumming; but
he took it seriously enough, when I gave him some particulars about the Black
Veil case, when young Aster died. You remember, he said it was a piece of silly
superstition, and stayed outside. Poor devil!</p>

<p>"As it chanced, the night passed quietly enough, until a little while before
dawn when we both heard the sounds of a great horse galloping round and round
the house, just as old Captain Hisgins had described it. You can imagine how
queer it made me feel, and directly afterwards, I heard someone stir within the
room. I knocked at the door; for I was uneasy, and the Captain came. I asked
whether everything was right; to which he replied yes, and immediately asked me
whether I had heard the sounds of the galloping; so that I knew he had heard
them also. I suggested that it might be well to leave the bedroom door open a
little, until the dawn came in, as there was certainly something abroad. This
was done, and he went back into the room, to be near his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>"I had better say here, that I was doubtful whether there was any value in
the 'Defense' about Miss Hisgins; for what I term the 'personal-sounds' of the
manifestation were so extraordinarily material, that I was inclined to parallel
the case with that of Hartford's, where the hand of the child kept
materialising within the pentacle, and patting the floor. As you will remember,
that was a hideous business.</p>

<p>"Yet, as it chanced, nothing further happened; and so soon as daylight had
fully come, we all went off to bed.</p>

<p>"Beaumont knocked me up about midday, and I went down and made breakfast
into lunch. Miss Hisgins was there, and seemed in very fair spirits,
considering. She told me that I had made her feel almost safe, for the first
time for days. She told me also that her cousin, Harry Parsket, was coming down
from London, and she knew that he would do anything to help fight the ghost.
And after that she and Beaumont went out into the grounds, to have a little
time together.</p>

<p>"I had a walk in the grounds myself, and went round the house, but saw no
traces of hoof-marks; and after that, I spent the rest of the day, making an
examination of the house; but found nothing.</p>

<p>"I made an end of my search, before dark, and went to my room to dress for
dinner. When I got down, the cousin had just arrived; and I found him one of
the nicest men I have met for a long time. A chap with a tremendous amount of
pluck, and the particular kind of man I like to have with me, in a bad case
like the one I was on.</p>

<p>"I could see that what puzzled him most was our belief in the genuineness of
the haunting; and I found myself almost wanting something to happen, just to
show him how true it was. As it chanced, something did happen, with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>"Beaumont and Miss Hisgins had gone out for a stroll in the dusk, and
Captain Hisgins asked me to come into his study for a short chat whilst Parsket
went upstairs with his traps, for he had no man with him.</p>

<p>"I had a long conversation with the old Captain, in which I pointed out that
the 'haunting' had evidently no particular connection with the house, but only
with the girl herself, and that the sooner she was married, the better, as it
would give Beaumont a right to be with her at all times; and further than this,
it might be that the manifestations would cease, if the marriage were actually
performed. The old man nodded agreement to this, especially to the first part,
and reminded me that three of the girls who were said to have been 'haunted'
had been sent away from home, and met their deaths whilst away. And then in the
midst of our talk there came a pretty frightening interruption; for all at once
the old butler rushed into the room, most extraordinarily pale:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Miss Mary, sir! Miss Mary, sir!' he gasped out, using the old name. 'She's
screaming...out in the park, Sir! And they say they can hear the
Horse&mdash;'</p>

<p>"The Captain made one dive for a rack of arms, and snatched down his old
sword, and ran out, drawing it as he ran. I dashed out and up the stairs,
snatched my camera-flashlight and a heavy revolver, gave one yell at Parsket's
door:&mdash;'The Horse!' and was down and into the grounds.</p>

<p>"Out in the darkness there was a confused shouting, and I caught the sounds
of shooting, away out among the scattered trees. And then, from a patch of
blackness to my left, there burst suddenly an infernal gobbling sort of
neighing. Instantly I whipped round and snapped off the flashlight. The great
blare of the light blazed out momentarily, showing me the leaves of a big tree
close at hand, quivering in the night breeze; but there had been nothing else;
and then the ten-fold blackness came down upon me, and I heard Parsket shouting
a little way back to know whether I had seen anything.</p>

<p>"The next instant he was beside me, and I felt safer for his company; for
there was some incredible thing near to us, and I was momentarily blind,
because of the brightness of the flashlight. 'What was it? What was it?' he
kept repeating in an excited voice. And all the time I was staring into the
darkness and answering, mechanically, 'I don't know. I don't know.' There was a
burst of shouting somewhere ahead, and then a shot. We ran towards the sounds,
yelling to the people not to shoot; for in the darkness and panic there was
this danger also. Then there came two of the gamekeepers, racing hard up the
drive, with lanterns and their guns; and immediately afterwards a row of lights
dancing towards us from the house, carried by some of the men-servants.</p>

<p>"As the lights came up, I saw we had come close to Beaumont. He was standing
over Miss Hisgins, and he had his revolver in his right hand. Then I saw his
face, and there was a great wound across his forehead. By him was the Captain,
turning his naked sword this way and that, and peering into the darkness; and a
little behind him stood the old butler, a battle-axe from one of the
arms-stands in the hall, in his hands. Yet there was nothing strange to be seen
anywhere.</p>

<p>"We got the girl into the house, and left her with her mother and Beaumont,
whilst a groom rode for a doctor. And then the rest of us, with four other
keepers, all armed with guns and carrying lanterns, searched round the
home-park. But we found nothing.</p>

<p>"When we got back, we found that the doctor had been. He had bound up
Beaumont's wound, which, luckily, was not deep, and ordered Miss Hisgins
straight to bed. I went upstairs with the Captain and found Beaumont on guard
outside the girl's door. I asked him how he felt; and then, so soon as they
were ready for us, Captain Hisgins and I went into the bedroom and fixed the
pentacle again round the bed. They had already got lamps about the room; and
after I had set the same order of watching, as on the previous night, I joined
Beaumont, outside of the door.</p>

<p>"Parsket had come up while I had been in the bedroom, and between us we got
some idea from Beaumont as to what had happened out in the park. It seems that
they were coming home after their stroll, from the direction of the West Lodge;
when, suddenly, Miss Hisgins said, 'Hush!' and came to a standstill. He
stopped, and listened; but heard nothing for a little. Then he caught
it&mdash;the sound of a horse, seemingly a long way off, galloping towards them
over the grass. He told the girl that it was nothing, and started to hurry her
towards the house, but she was not deceived, of course. In less than a minute,
they heard it quite close to them in the dark, and they began to run. Then Miss
Hisgins caught her foot, and fell. She began to scream, and that is what the
butler heard. As Beaumont lifted the girl, he heard the hoofs come thudding
right at him. He stood over her, and fired all five chambers of his revolver at
the sounds. He told us that he was sure he saw something that looked like an
enormous horse's head, right upon him, in the light of the last flash of his
pistol. Immediately afterwards, he was struck a tremendous blow, which knocked
him down; and then the Captain and the butler came running up, shouting. The
rest, of course, we knew.</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock, the butler brought us up a tray; for which I was very
glad; as the night before I had got rather hungry. I warned Beaumont, however,
to be very particular not to drink any spirits, and I also made him give me his
pipe and matches. At midnight, I drew a pentacle round him, and Parsket and I
sat one on each side of him; but outside of the pentacle; for I had no fear
that there would be any manifestation made against anyone, except Beaumont or
Miss Hisgins.</p>

<p>"After that, we kept pretty quiet. The passage was lit by a big lamp at each
end; so that we had plenty of light; and we were all armed. Beaumont and I with
revolvers, and Parsket with a shotgun. In addition to my weapon, I had my
camera and flashlight.</p>

<p>"Now and again we talked in whispers; and twice the Captain came out of the
bedroom to have a word with us. About half past one, we had all grown very
silent; and suddenly, about twenty minutes later, I held up my hand, silently;
for there seemed to me to be a sound of galloping, out in the night. I knocked
on the bedroom door, for the Captain to open it, and when he came, I whispered
to him that we thought we heard the Horse. For some time we stayed, listening,
and both Parsket and the Captain thought they heard it; but now I was not so
sure, neither was Beaumont. Yet afterwards, I thought I heard it again.</p>

<p>"I told Captain Hisgins I thought he had better go back into the bedroom,
and leave the door a little open, and this he did. But from that time onward,
we heard nothing; and presently the dawn came in, and we all went very
thankfully to bed.</p>

<p>"When I was called at lunch-time, I had a little surprise; for Captain
Hisgins told me that they had held a family council, and had decided to take my
advice, and have the marriage without a day's more delay than possible.
Beaumont was already on his way to London to get a special licence, and they
hoped to have the wedding the next day.</p>

<p>"This pleased me; for it seemed the sanest thing to be done, in the
extraordinary circumstances; and meanwhile I should continue my investigations;
but until the marriage was accomplished, my chief thought was to keep Miss
Hisgins near to me.</p>

<p>"After lunch, I thought I would take a few experimental photographs of Miss
Hisgins and her surroundings. Sometimes the camera sees things that would seem
very strange to normal human eyesight. You see what I mean? With this
intention, and partly to make an excuse to keep her in my company as much as
possible, I asked Miss Hisgins to join me in my experiments. She seemed glad to
do this, and I spent several hours with her, wandering all over the house, from
room to room; and whenever the impulse came, I took a flashlight of her and the
room or corridor in which we chanced to be at the moment.</p>

<p>"After we had gone right through the house in this fashion, I asked her
whether she felt sufficiently brave to repeat the experiments in the cellars.
She said, yes; and so I rooted out Captain Hisgins and Parsket; for I was not
going to take her down even into what you might call artificial darkness,
without help and companionship at hand.</p>

<p>"When we were ready, we went down into the wine cellar, Captain Hisgins
carrying a shotgun, and Parsket a specially-prepared background and a lantern.
I got the girl to stand in the middle of the cellar, whilst Parsket and the
Captain held out the background behind her. Then I fired off the flashlight,
and we went into the next cellar, where we repeated the experiment.</p>

<p>"Then, in the third cellar, a tremendous, pitch-dark place, something
extraordinary and horrible manifested itself. I had stationed Miss Hisgins in
the centre of the place, with her father and Parsket holding the background, as
before. When all was ready, and just as I pressed the trigger of the 'flash,'
there came in the cellar that dreadful, gobbling neighing, that I had heard out
in the park. It seemed to come from somewhere above the girl; and in the glare
of the sudden light, I saw that she was staring tensely upward at no visible
thing. And then in the succeeding comparative darkness, I was shouting to the
Captain and Parsket to run Miss Hisgins out into the daylight.</p>

<p>"This was done, instantly; and I shut and locked the door, afterwards making
the First and the Eighth signs of the Saaamaaa Ritual opposite to each post,
and connecting them across the threshold with a triple line. In the meanwhile,
Parsket and Captain Hisgins carried the girl to her mother, and left her there,
in a half-fainting condition; whilst I stayed on guard outside of the cellar
door, feeling pretty horrible, for I knew that there was some disgusting thing
inside; and along with this feeling there was a sense of half-ashamedness,
rather miserable you know, because I had exposed Miss Hisgins to this
danger.</p>

<p>"I had got the Captain's shotgun, and when he and Parsket came down again,
they were each carrying guns and lanterns. I could not possibly tell you the
utter relief of spirit and body that came to me, when I heard them coming; but
just try to imagine what it was like, standing outside of that cellar. Can
you?</p>

<p>"I remember noticing, just before I went to unlock the door, how white and
ghastly Parsket looked and the old Captain was grey-looking; and I wondered
whether my face was like theirs. And this, you know, had its own distinct
effect upon my nerves; for it seemed to bring the beastliness of the thing bash
down on me in a fresh way. I know it was only sheer will power that carried me
up to the door and made me turn the key.</p>

<p>"I paused one little moment, and then with a nervy jerk, sent the door wide
open, and held my lantern over my head. Parsket and the Captain came one on
each side of me, and held up their lanterns; but the place was absolutely
empty. Of course, I did not trust to a casual look of this kind; but spent
several hours, with the help of the two others in sounding every square foot of
the floor, ceiling, and walls. Yet, in the end, I had to admit that the place
itself was absolutely normal; and so in the end we came away none the wiser.
But I sealed the door, and outside, opposite each door-post, I made the First
and Last Signs of the Saaamaaa Ritual, joining them, as before, with a triple
line. Can you imagine what it was like, searching that cellar?</p>

<p>"When we got upstairs, I inquired very anxiously how Miss Hisgins was, and
the girl came out herself to tell me that she was all right and that I was not
to trouble about her, or blame myself, as I told her I had been doing. I felt
happier then, and went off to dress for dinner; and after that was done with,
Parsket and I went off to one of the bathrooms to develop the negatives that I
had been taking. Yet none of the plates had anything to tell me, until we came
to the one that was taken in the cellar. Parsket was developing, and I had
taken a batch of the fixed plates out into the lamplight to examine them.</p>

<p>"I had just gone carefully through the lot, when I heard a shout from
Parsket, and when I ran to him, he was looking at a partly-developed negative,
which he was holding up to the red lamp. It showed the girl plainly, looking
upward, as I had seen her; but the thing that astonished me, was the shadow of
an enormous hoof, right above her, as if it were coming down upon her out of
the shadows. And, you know, I had run her bang into that danger. That was the
thought that was chief in my mind.</p>

<p>"As soon as the developing was complete, I fixed the plate, and examined it
carefully in a good light. There was no doubt about it at all; the thing above
Miss Hisgins was an enormous, shadowy hoof. Yet I was no nearer to coming to
any definite knowledge; and the only thing I could do was to warn Parsket to
say nothing about it to the girl; for it would only increase her fright; but I
showed the thing to her father, for I considered it right that he should
know.</p>

<p>"That night, we took the same precautions for Miss Hisgins' safety, as on
the two previous nights; and Parsket kept me company; yet the dawn came in
without anything unusual having happened, and I went off to bed.</p>

<p>"When I got down to lunch, I learnt that Beaumont had wired to say that he
would be in soon after four; also that a message had been sent to the Rector.
And it was generally plain that the ladies of the house were in a tremendous
fluster.</p>

<p>"Beaumont's train was late, and he did not get home until five, but even
then the Rector had not put in an appearance; and the butler came in to say
that the coachman had returned without him, as he had been called away
unexpectedly. Twice more during the evening the carriage was sent down; but the
clergyman had not returned; and we had to delay the marriage until the next
day.</p>

<p>"That night, I arranged the 'Defense' round the girl's bed, and the Captain
and his wife sat up with her, as before. Beaumont, as I expected, insisted on
keeping watch with me, and he seemed in a curiously frightened mood; not for
himself, you know; but for Miss Hisgins. He had a horrible feeling, he told me,
that there would be a final, dreadful attempt on his sweetheart, that night.
This, of course, I told him was nothing but nerves; yet, really, it made me
feel very anxious; for I have seen too much, not to know that under such
circumstances, a premonitory conviction of impending danger, is not necessarily
to be put down entirely to nerves. In fact, Beaumont was so simply and
earnestly convinced that the night would bring some extraordinary
manifestation, that I got Parsket to rig up a long cord from the wire of the
butler's bell, to come along the passage handy. To the butler himself, I gave
directions not to undress and to give the same order to two of the footmen. If
I rang, he was to come instantly, with the footmen, carrying lanterns; and the
lanterns were to be kept ready lit all night. If, for any reason, the bell did
not ring, and I blew my whistle, he was to take that as a signal in the place
of the bell.</p>

<p>"After I had arranged all these minor details, I drew a pentacle about
Beaumont, and warned him very particularly to stay within it, whatever
happened. And when this was done, there was nothing to do but wait, and pray
that the night would go as quietly as the night before.</p>

<p>"We scarcely talked at all, and by about one a.m. we were all very tense and
nervous; so that, at last, Parsket got up and began to walk up and down the
corridor, to steady himself a bit. Presently, I slipped off my pumps, and
joined him and we walked up and down, whispering occasionally, for something
over an hour, until in turning I caught my foot in the bell-cord, and went down
on my face; but without hurting myself or making a noise.</p>

<p>"When I got up, Parsket nudged me.</p>

<p>"'Did you notice that the bell never rang?' he whispered.</p>

<p>"'Jove!' I said, 'you're right.'</p>

<p>"'Wait a minute,' he answered. 'I'll bet it's only a kink somewhere in the
cord.' He left his gun, and slipped along the passage, and taking the top lamp,
tiptoed away into the house, carrying Beaumont's revolver ready in his right
hand. He was a plucky chap, as I think you will admit.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, Beaumont motioned to me for absolute quiet. Directly afterwards,
I heard the thing for which he listened&mdash;the sound of a horse galloping,
out in the night. I think that I may say, I fairly shivered. The sound died
away, and left a horrible, desolate, eerie feeling, in the air, you know. I put
my hand out to the bell-cord, hoping that Parsket had got it clear. Then I
waited, glancing before and behind. Perhaps two minutes passed, full of what
seemed like an almost unearthly quiet. And then, suddenly, down the corridor,
at the lighted end, there sounded the clumping of a great hoof; and instantly
the lamp was thrown down with a tremendous crash, and we were in the dark. I
tugged hard on the cord, and blew the whistle; then I raised my snap-shot, and
fired the flashlight. The corridor blazed into brilliant light; but there was
nothing; and then the darkness fell like thunder. I heard the Captain at the
bedroom door, and shouted to him to bring out a lamp, quick; but instead,
something started to kick the door, and I heard the Captain shouting within the
bedroom, and then the screaming of the women. I had a sudden horrible fear that
the monster had got into the bedroom; but in the same instant, from up the
corridor, there came abruptly the vile, gobbling neighing that we had heard in
the park and the cellar. I blew the whistle again, and groped blindly for the
bell-cord, shouting to Beaumont to stay in the pentacle, whatever happened. I
yelled again to the Captain to bring out a lamp, and there came a smashing
sound against the bedroom door. Then I had my matches in my hand, to get some
light before that incredible, unseen Monster was upon us.</p>

<p>"The match scraped on the box, and flared up, dully; and in the same
instant, I heard a faint sound behind me. I whipped round, in a kind of mad
terror, and saw something, in the light of the match&mdash;a monstrous
horse-head, close to Beaumont.</p>

<p>"'Look out, Beaumont!' I shouted in a sort of scream. 'It's behind you!'</p>

<p>"The match went out, abruptly, and instantly there came the huge bang of
Parsket's double-barrel (both barrels at once), fired (evidently single-handed
by Beaumont) close to my ear, as it seemed. I caught a momentary glimpse of the
great head, in the flash, and of an enormous hoof amid the belch of fire and
smoke, seeming to be descending upon Beaumont. In the same instant, I fired
three chambers of my revolver. There was the sound of a dull blow, and then
that horrible, gobbling neigh, broke out close to me. I fired twice at the
sound. Immediately afterwards, Something struck me, and I was knocked
backwards. I got on to my knees, and shouted for help, at the top of my voice.
I heard the women screaming behind the closed door of the bedroom, and was
dully aware that the door was being smashed from the inside; and directly
afterwards I knew that Beaumont was struggling with some hideous thing, near to
me. For an instant, I held back, stupidly, paralysed with funk; and then,
blindly, and in a sort of rigid chill of goose-flesh, I went to help him,
shouting his name. I can tell you, I did not feel much of a hero. There came a
little, choking scream, out of the darkness; and at that, I jumped forward into
the dark. I gripped a vast, furry ear. Then something struck me another great
blow, knocking me sick. I hit back, weak and blind, and gripped with my other
hand at the incredible thing. Abruptly, I was dimly aware of a tremendous crash
behind me, and a great burst of light. There were other lights in the passage,
and a noise of feet and shouting. My hand-grips were torn from the thing they
held; I shut my eyes stupidly, and heard a loud yell above me; and then a heavy
blow, like a butcher chopping meat; and something fell upon me.</p>

<p>"I was helped to my knees by the Captain and the butler. On the floor lay an
enormous horse-head, out of which protruded a man's trunk and legs. On the
wrists were fixed great hoofs. It was the monster. The Captain cut something
with the sword that he held in his hand, and stooped and lifted off the mask;
for that is what it was. I saw the face then of the man who had worn it. It was
Parsket. He had a bad wound across the forehead, where the Captain's sword had
hit through the mask. I looked bewilderedly from him to Beaumont, who was
sitting up, leaning against the wall of the corridor. Then I stared at Parsket,
again.</p>

<p>"'By Jove!' I said at last, and then I was quiet; for I was so ashamed for
the man. You can understand, can't you. And he was opening his eyes. And, you
know, I had grown so to like the man.</p>

<p>"And then, you know, just as Parsket was getting back his wits, and looking
from one to the other of us, and beginning to remember, there happened a
strange and incredible thing. For from the end of the corridor, there sounded,
suddenly, the clumping of a great hoof. I looked that way, and then instantly
at Parsket, and saw a horrible fear in his face and eyes. He wrenched himself
round, weakly, and stared in mad terror up the corridor to where the sound had
been; and the rest of us stared, all in a frozen group. I remember hearing
vaguely, half sobs and whispers from Miss Hisgins' bedroom, all the while that
I stared, frightenedly, up the corridor.</p>

<p>"The silence lasted several seconds; and then, abruptly, there came again
the clumping of the great hoof, away up at the end of the corridor. And
immediately afterwards, the clungk, clunck-clungk, clunck, of mighty hoofs
coming down the passage, towards us.</p>

<p>"Even then, you know, most of us thought it was some mechanism of Parsket's
still at work; and we were in the queerest mixture of fright and doubt. I think
everyone looked at Parsket. And suddenly the Captain shouted out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Stop this damned fooling at once. Haven't you done enough!'</p>

<p>"For my part, you know, I was frightened; for I had a sense that there was
something horrible and wrong. And then Parsket managed to gasp out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It's not me! My God! It's not me! My God! It's not me.'</p>

<p>"And then, you know, it seemed to come home to everyone in an instant that
there was really some dreadful thing coming down the passage. There was a mad
rush up the passage, and even old Captain Hisgins gave back with the butler and
the footmen. Beaumont fainted outright, as I found afterwards; for he had been
badly mauled. I just flattened back against the wall, kneeling, as I was, too
stupid and dazed even to run. And almost in the same instant the ponderous
hoof-falls sounded close to me, and seeming to shake the solid floor, as they
passed. Abruptly the great sounds ceased, and I knew in a sort of sick fashion
that the thing had halted opposite to the open door of the girl's bedroom. And
then, you know, I was aware that Parsket was standing rocking in the doorway,
with his arms spread across, so as to fill the doorway with his body. Parsket
showed extraordinarily pale, and the blood was running down his face from the
wound in his forehead; and then I noticed that he seemed to be looking at
something in the passage with a peculiar, desperate, fixed gaze. But, there was
really nothing to be seen. And suddenly the clungk, clunck&mdash;clungk,
clunck, recommenced, and passed onward down the passage. And in the same
moment, Parsket pitched forward out of the doorway on to his face.</p>

<p>"There were shouts from the huddle of men down the passage, and the two
footmen and the butler simply ran, carrying their lanterns, but the Captain
went against the side-wall with his back and put the lamp he was carrying over
his head. The dull tread of the Horse went past him, and left him unharmed; and
I heard the monstrous hoof-falls going away and away through the quiet house;
and after that a dead silence.</p>

<p>"Then the Captain moved, and came towards us, very slow and shaky, and with
an extraordinarily grey face.</p>

<p>"I crept towards Parsket, and the Captain came to help me. We turned him
over; and, you know, I knew in a moment that he was dead; but you can imagine
what a feeling it sent through me.</p>

<p>"I looked at the Captain and suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"'That&mdash;That&mdash;That&mdash;,' and I know that he was trying to tell
me that Parsket had stood between his daughter and whatever it was that had
gone down the passage. I stood up, and steadied him; though I was not very
steady myself. And suddenly, his face began to work, and he went down on to his
knees by Parsket and cried like some shaken child. And then, you know, I knew
that the women were in the doorway of the bedroom and I turned away and left
him to them, whilst I went over to Beaumont.</p>

<p>"That is practically the whole story; and the only thing that is left to me
is to try to explain some of the puzzling parts, here and there.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have seen that Parsket was in love with Miss Hisgins; and this
fact is the key to a good deal that was extraordinary. He was doubtless
responsible for some portions of the 'haunting'; in fact I think for nearly
everything; but, you know, I can prove nothing, and what I have to tell you is
chiefly the result of deduction.</p>

<p>"In the first place, it is obvious that Parsket's intention was to frighten
Beaumont away; and when he found that he could not do this, I think he grew so
desperate that he really intended to kill him. I hate to say this; but the
facts force me to think so.</p>

<p>"It is quite certain that Parsket was the person who broke Beaumont's arm.
He knew all the details of the so-called Horse Legend, and got the idea to work
upon the old story, for his own end. He evidently had some method of slipping
in and out of the house, probably through one of the many French windows, or
possibly he had a key to one or two of the garden doors; and when he was
supposed to be away, he was really coming down, on the quiet, and hiding
somewhere in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"The incident of the kiss in the dark hall, I put down to sheer nervous
imaginings on the part of Beaumont and Miss Hisgins; yet, I must say that the
sound of the horse outside of the front door, is a little difficult to explain
away. But I am still inclined to keep to my first idea on this point, that
there was nothing really unnatural about it.</p>

<p>"The hoof-sounds in the billiard room and down the passage, were done by
Parsket, from the floor below, by pomping against the panelled ceiling with a
block of wood tied to one of the window-hooks. I proved this, by an
examination, which showed the dints in the woodwork.</p>

<p>"The sounds of the horse galloping round the house, was also done by
Parsket, who must have had a horse tied up in the plantation, near by, unless,
indeed, he made the sounds himself; but I do not see how he could have gone
fast enough to produce the illusion, you see?</p>

<p>"The gobbling neighing in the park was a ventriloquial achievement on the
part of Parsket; and the attack out there on Beaumont was also by him; so that
when I thought he was in his bedroom, he must have been outside all the time,
and joined me after I ran out of the front door. This is probable, I mean that
Parsket was the cause, for if it had been something more serious, he would
certainly have given up his foolishness, knowing that there was no longer any
need for it. I cannot imagine how he escaped being shot, both then, and in the
last mad action, of which I have just told you. He was enormously without fear
of any kind for himself, as you can see.</p>

<p>"The time when Parsket was with us, when we thought we heard the Horse
galloping round the house, we must have been deceived. No one was very sure,
except, of course, Parsket, who would naturally encourage the belief.</p>

<p>"The neighing in the cellar, is where I consider there came the first
suspicion into Parsket's mind that there was something more at work than his
sham-haunting. The neighing was done by him, in the same way that he did it in
the park; when I remember how ghastly he looked, I feel sure that the sounds
must have had some infernal quality added to them, which frightened the man
himself. Yet, later, he would persuade himself that he had been getting
fanciful. Of course, I must not forget that the effect upon Miss Hisgins must
have made him feel pretty miserable.</p>

<p>"Then, about the clergyman being called away, we found afterwards that it
was a bogus errand, or rather, call; and it is obvious that Parsket was at the
bottom of this, so as to get a few more hours in which to achieve his end; and
what that was, a very little imagination will show you; for he had found that
Beaumont would not be frightened away. You see what I mean?</p>

<p>"Then, there is no doubt at all but that Parsket left the cord to the
butler's bell in a tangle, or hitched somewhere, so as to give him an excuse to
slip away naturally to clear it. This also gave him the opportunity to remove
one of the passage lamps. Then he had only to smash the other, and the passage
was in utter darkness, for him to make the attempt on Beaumont.</p>

<p>"In the same way, it was he who locked the door of the bedroom, and took the
key (it was in his pocket). This prevented the Captain from bringing a light,
and coming to the rescue. But Captain Hisgins broke down the door, with the
heavy fender-curb; and it was his smashing the door that had sounded so
confusing and frightening in the darkness of the passage.</p>

<p>"The photograph of the monstrous hoof above Miss Hisgins in the cellar, is
one of the things that I am less sure about. It might have been faked by
Parsket, whilst I was out of the room, and this would have been easy enough, to
anyone who knew how. But, you know, it does not look like a fake. Yet, there is
as much evidence of probability that it was faked, as against; and the thing is
too vague for an examination to help to a definite decision; so that I will
express no opinion, one way or the other. It is certainly a horrible
photograph.</p>

<p>"And now I come to that last, dreadful thing. There has been no further
manifestation of anything abnormal; so that there is an extraordinary
uncertainty in my conclusions. If we had not heard those last sounds, and if
Parsket had not shown that enormous sense of fear, the whole of this case could
be explained away in the way in which I have shown. And, in fact, as you have
seen, I am of the opinion that almost all of it can be cleared up; but I see no
way of going past the thing we heard at the last, and the fear that Parsket
showed.</p>

<p>"His death&mdash;No, that proves nothing. At the inquest it was described
somewhat untechnically as due to heart-spasm. That is normal enough, and leaves
us quite in the dark as to whether he died because he stood between the girl
and some incredible monster.</p>

<p>"The look on Parsket's face, and the thing he called out, when he heard the
great hoof-sounds coming down the passage, seem to show that he had the sudden
realisation of what before then may have been nothing more than a horrible
suspicion. And his fear and appreciation of some tremendous danger approaching
was probably more keenly real even than mine. And then he did the one fine,
great thing!"</p>

<p>"And the cause?" I said. "What caused it?"</p>

<p>Carnacki shook his head.</p>

<p>"God knows," he answered, with a peculiar sincere reverence. "If that thing
was what it seemed to be, one might suggest an explanation, which would not
offend one's reason, but which may be utterly wrong. Yet I have thought, though
it would take a long lecture on Thought Induction to get you to appreciate my
reasons, that Parsket had produced what I might term a kind of 'induced
haunting,' a kind of induced simulation of his mental conceptions, due to his
desperate thoughts and broodings. It is impossible to make it clearer, in a few
words."</p>

<p>"But the old story!" I said. "Why may not there have been something in
that?"</p>

<p>"There may have been something in it," said Carnacki, quietly. "But I do not
think it had anything to do with this. I have not clearly thought out my
reasons, yet; but later I may be able to tell you why I think so."</p>

<p>"And the marriage? And the cellar&mdash;was there anything found there?"
asked Taylor.</p>

<p>"Yes, the marriage was performed that day, in spite of the tragedy,"
Carnacki told us. "It was the wisest thing to do&mdash;considering the things
that I cannot explain. Yes, I had the floor of that big cellar up; for I had a
feeling I might find something there to give me some light. But there was
nothing.</p>

<p>"You know, the whole thing is tremendous and extraordinary. I shall never
forget the look on Parsket's face. And afterwards the disgusting sounds of
those great hoofs going away through the quiet house."</p>

<p>Carnacki stood up:</p>

<p>"Out you go!" he said in friendly fashion, using the recognised formula.</p>

<p>And we went presently out into the quiet of the Embankment, and so to our
homes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>No. 5. - THE SEARCHER OF THE END HOUSE</h2>

<h3>[From The Idler, June 1910]</h3>

<h4>(Thomas Carnacki, the famous Investigator of "real" ghost stories, tells
here the details of a peculiarly frightening experience)</h4>

<p>It was still evening, as I remember, and the four of us, Jessop, Arkright,
Taylor and I, looked disappointedly at Carnacki where he sat silent in his
great chair.</p>

<p>We had come in response to the usual card of invitation which&mdash;as you
know&mdash;we have come to consider as a sure prelude to a good story; and now,
after telling us the short incident of the Three Straw Platters, he had lapsed
into a contented silence, and the night not half gone, as I have hinted.</p>

<p>However, as it chanced, some pitying fate jogged Carnacki's elbow, or his
memory, and he began again in his queer level way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This 'Straw Platters' business reminds me of the 'Searcher' Case, which I
have sometimes thought might interest you. It was some time ago, in fact a
deuce of a long time ago, that the thing happened; and my experience of what I
might term 'curious' things was very small at that time.</p>

<p>"I was living with my Mother, when it occurred, in a small house just
outside of Appledorn, on the South Coast. The house was the last of a row of
detached cottage-villas, each house standing in its own garden; and very dainty
little places they were, very old, and most of them smothered in roses; and all
with those quaint old leaded windows, and doors of genuine oak. You must just
try to picture them for the sake of their complete niceness.</p>

<p>"Now I must remind you at the beginning, that my Mother and I had lived in
that little house for two years; and in the whole of that time there had not
been a single peculiar happening to worry us.</p>

<p>"And then, something happened.</p>

<p>"It was about two o'clock one morning, as I was finishing some letters, that
I heard the door of my Mother's bedroom open, and she came to the top of the
stairs, and knocked on the banisters.</p>

<p>"'All right, dear,' I called; for I supposed that she was merely reminding
me that I should have been in bed long ago; then I heard her go back to her
room, and I hurried my work, for fear that she should lie awake, until she had
heard me safe up to my room.</p>

<p>"When I was finished, I lit my candle, put out the lamp, and went upstairs.
As I came opposite to the door of my Mother's room, I saw that it was open and
called good night to her, very softly, and asked whether I should close the
door. As there was no answer, I knew that she had dropped off to sleep again,
and I closed the door very gently, and turned into my room, just across the
passage. As I did so, I experienced a momentary, half-aware sense of a faint,
peculiar, disagreeable odour in the passage; but it was not until the following
night that I realised that I had noticed a smell that offended me. You follow
me? I mean, it is so often like that&mdash;one suddenly knows about a thing
that really recorded itself on one's consciousness, perhaps a year before.</p>

<p>"The next morning at breakfast, I mentioned casually to my Mother that she
had 'dropped-off,' and that I had shut her door for her. To my surprise, she
assured me that she had never been out of her room. I reminded her about the
two raps that she had given upon the banister; but she was still certain that I
must be mistaken; and in the end I teased her, saying she had got so accustomed
to my bad habit of sitting up late, that she had come to call me in her sleep.
Of course, she denied this, and I let the matter drop; but I was more than a
little puzzled, and did not know whether to believe my own explanation, or to
take the mater's, which was to put the noises down to the mice, and the open
door to the fact that she couldn't have properly latched it when she went to
bed. I suppose, away in the subconscious part of me, I had a stirring of less
reasonable thoughts; but certainly, I had no real uneasiness at that time.</p>

<p>"The next night there came a further development. About two-thirty a.m., I
heard my Mother's door open, just as on the previous night, and immediately
afterwards she rapped sharply, on the banister, as it seemed to me. I stopped
my work and called up to her that I would not be long. As she made no reply,
and I did not hear her go back to bed, I had a quick sense of wonder whether
she might not be doing it in her sleep, after all, just as I had said.</p>

<p>"With the thought, I stood up, and taking the lamp from the table, began to
go towards the door, which was open into the passage. It was then I got a
sudden nasty sort of thrill; for it came to me, all at once, that my Mother
never knocked, when I sat up too late; she always called. You will understand I
was not really frightened in any way; only vaguely uneasy, and pretty sure that
she must really be doing the thing in her sleep.</p>

<p>"I went quickly up the stairs, and when I had come to the top, my Mother was
not there; but her door was open. I had a bewildered sense though believing she
must have gone quietly back to bed, without my hearing her. I entered her room
and found her sleeping quietly and naturally; for the vague sense of trouble in
me was sufficiently strong to make me go over to look at her.</p>

<p>"When I was sure that she was perfectly right in every way, I was still a
little bothered; but much more inclined to think my suspicion correct and that
she had got quietly back into bed in her sleep, without knowing what she had
been doing. This was the most reasonable thing to think, as you must see.</p>

<p>"And then it came to me, suddenly, that vague, queer, mildewy smell in the
room; and it was in that instant I became aware that I had smelt the same
strange, uncertain smell the night before in the passage.</p>

<p>"I was definitely uneasy now, and began to search my Mother's room, though
with no aim or clear thought of anything, except to assure myself that there
was nothing in the room. All the time, you know, I never expected really to
find anything; only my uneasiness had to be reassured.</p>

<p>"In the middle of my search my Mother woke up, and of course I had to
explain. I told her about her door opening, and the knocks on the banister, and
that I had come up and found her asleep. I said nothing about the smell, which
was not very distinct; but told her that the thing happening twice had made me
a bit nervous, and possibly fanciful, and I thought I would take a look round,
just to feel satisfied.</p>

<p>"I have thought since then that the reason I made no mention of the smell,
was not only that I did not want to frighten my Mother, for I was scarcely that
way myself; but because I had only a vague half-knowledge that I associated the
smell with fancies too indefinite and peculiar to bear talking about. You will
understand that I am able now to analyse and put the thing into words; but then
I did not even know my chief reason for saying nothing; let alone appreciate
its possible significance.</p>

<p>"It was my Mother, after all, who put part of my vague sensations into
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What a disagreeable smell!' she exclaimed, and was silent a moment,
looking at me. Then:-'You feel that there's something wrong?' still looking at
me, very quietly but with a little, nervous note of questioning expectancy.</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' I said. 'I can't understand it, unless you've really been
walking about in your sleep.'</p>

<p>"'The smell,' she said.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I replied. 'That's what puzzles me too. I'll have a walk through the
house; but I don't suppose it's anything.'</p>

<p>"I lit her candle, and taking the lamp, I went through the two other
bedrooms, and afterwards all over the house, including the three underground
cellars, which was a little trying to the nerves, seeing that I was more
nervous than I would admit.</p>

<p>"Then I went back to my Mother and told her that there was really nothing to
bother about; and, you know, in the end, we talked ourselves into believing
that it was nothing. My Mother would not agree that she might have been
sleep-walking; but she was ready to put the door opening down to the fault of
the latch, which certainly snicked very lightly. As for the knocks, they might
be the old warped woodwork of the house cracking a bit, or a mouse rattling a
piece of loose plaster. The smell was more difficult to explain; but finally we
agreed that it might easily be the queer night-smell of the moist earth, coming
in through the window of my Mother's room, from the back garden, or&mdash;for
that matter&mdash;from the little church-yard beyond the big wall at the bottom
of the garden.</p>

<p>"And so we quietened down, and finally I went to bed, and to sleep.</p>

<p>"I think this is certainly a good lesson on the way in which we humans can
delude ourselves; for there was not one of these explanations that my reason
could really accept. Try to imagine yourselves in the same circumstances, and
you will see how absurd our attempts to explain the happenings really were.</p>

<p>"In the morning, when I came down to breakfast, we talked it all over again,
and whilst we agreed that it was strange, we also agreed that we had begun to
imagine queer things in the backs of our minds, which now we felt half ashamed
to admit. This is very strange when you come to look into it; but very
human.</p>

<p>"And then that night again my Mother's door was slammed once more just after
midnight. I caught up the lamp, and when I reached her door, I found it shut. I
opened it quickly and went in, to find my Mother lying with her eyes open, and
rather nervous; having been waked by the bang of the door. But what upset me
more than anything, was the fact that there was a disgusting smell in the
passage and in her room.</p>

<p>"Whilst I was asking her whether she was all right, a door slammed twice
downstairs; and you can imagine how it made me feel. My Mother and I looked at
one another; and then I lit her candle, and taking the poker from the fender,
went downstairs with the lamp, beginning to feel really nervous. The cumulative
effect of so many queer happenings was getting hold of me; and all the
apparently reasonable explanations seemed futile.</p>

<p>"The horrible smell seemed to be very strong in the downstairs passage; also
in the front room and the cellars; but chiefly in the passage. I made a very
thorough search of the house, and when I had finished, I knew that all the
lower windows and doors were properly shut and fastened, and that there was no
living thing in the house, beyond our two selves. Then I went upstairs again to
my Mother's room again, and we talked the thing over for an hour or more, and
in the end came to the conclusion that we might, after all, be reading too much
into a number of little things; but, you know, inside of us, we did not believe
this.</p>

<p>"Later, when we had talked ourselves into a more comfortable state of mind,
I said good night, and went off to bed; and presently managed to get to
sleep.</p>

<p>"In the early hours of the morning, whilst it was still dark, I was waked by
a loud noise. I sat up in bed, and listened. And from downstairs, I
heard:&mdash;bang, bang, bang, one door after another being slammed; at least,
that is the impression the sounds gave me.</p>

<p>"I jumped out of bed, with the tingle and shiver of sudden fright on me; and
at the same moment, as I lit my candle, my door was pushed slowly open; I had
left it unlatched, so as not to feel that my Mother was quite shut off from
me.</p>

<p>"'Who's there?' I shouted out, in a voice about twice as deep as my natural
one, and with a queer breathlessness, that sudden fright so often gives one.
'Who's there?'</p>

<p>"Then I heard my Mother saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It's me, Thomas. Whatever is happening downstairs?'</p>

<p>"She was in the room by this time, and I saw that she had her bedroom poker
in one hand, and her candle in the other. I could have smiled at her, if it had
not been for the extraordinary sounds downstairs.</p>

<p>"I got into my slippers, and reached down an old sword-bayonet from the
wall. Then I picked up my candle, and begged my Mother not to come; but I knew
it would be little use, if she had made up her mind; and she had, with the
result that she acted as a sort of rearguard for me, during our search. I know,
in some ways, I was very glad to have her with me, as you will understand.</p>

<p>"By this time, the door-slamming had ceased, and there seemed, probably
because of the contrast, to be an appalling silence in the house. However, I
led the way, holding my candle high, and keeping the sword-bayonet very handy.
Downstairs we found all the doors wide open; although the outer doors and the
windows were closed all right. I began to wonder whether the noises had been
made by the doors after all. Of one thing only we were sure, and that was,
there was no living thing in the house, besides ourselves, while everywhere
throughout the house, there was the taint of that disgusting odour.</p>

<p>"Of course it was absurd to try to make-believe any longer. There was
something strange about the house; and as soon as it was daylight, I set my
Mother to packing; and soon after breakfast I saw her off by train.</p>

<p>"Then I set to work to try to clear up the mystery. I went first to the
landlord, and told him all the circumstances. From him, I found that twelve or
fifteen years back, the house had got rather a curious name from three or four
tenants; with the result that it had remained empty for a long while; in the
end he had let it at a low rent to a Captain Tobias, on the one condition that
he should hold his tongue, if he saw anything peculiar. The landlord's
idea&mdash;as he told me frankly&mdash;was to free the house from these tales
of 'something queer,' by keeping a tenant in it, and then to sell it for the
best price he could get.</p>

<p>"However, when Captain Tobias left, after a ten years' tenancy, there was no
longer any 'talk' about the house; so when I offered to take it on a five
years' lease, he had jumped at the offer. This was the whole story; so he gave
me to understand. When I pressed him for details of the supposed peculiar
happenings in the house, all those years back, he said the tenants had talked
about a woman who always moved about the house at night. Some tenants never saw
anything; but others would not stay out the first month's tenancy.</p>

<p>"One thing the landlord was particular to point out, that no tenant had ever
complained about knockings, or doors slamming. As for the smell, he seemed
positively indignant about it; but why, I don't suppose he knew himself, except
that he probably had some vague feeling that it was an indirect accusation on
my part that the drains were not right.</p>

<p>"In the end, I suggested he should come down and spend the night with me. He
agreed at once, especially as I told him I intended to keep the whole business
quiet, and try to get to the bottom of the curious affair; for he was anxious
to keep the rumour of the haunting from getting about.</p>

<p>"About three o'clock that afternoon, he came down, and we made a thorough
search of the house, which, however, revealed nothing unusual. Afterwards, the
landlord made one or two tests, which showed him that the drainage was in
perfect order; after that we made our preparations for sitting up all
night.</p>

<p>"First, we borrowed two policemen's dark lanterns from the station near by,
where the Superintendent and I were friendly; and as soon as it was really
dusk, the landlord went up to his house for his gun. I had the sword-bayonet I
have told you about; and when the landlord got back, we sat talking in my study
until nearly midnight.</p>

<p>"Then we lit the lanterns and went upstairs. We placed the lanterns, gun and
bayonet handy on the table; then I shut and sealed the bedroom doors;
afterwards we took our seats, and turned off the lights.</p>

<p>"From then, until two o'clock, nothing happened; but a little after two, as
I found by holding my watch near to the faint glow of the closed lanterns, I
had a time of quite extraordinary nervousness; and I bent towards the landlord,
and whispered to him that I had a queer feeling that something was about to
happen, and to be ready with his lantern; at the same time I reached out
towards mine. In the very instant I made this movement, the darkness which
filled the passage seemed to become suddenly of a dull violet colour; not, as
if a light had been shone; but as if the natural blackness of the night had
changed colour. And then, coming through this violet night, through this
violet-coloured gloom, came a little naked Child, running. In an extraordinary
way, the Child seemed not to be distinct from the surrounding gloom; but almost
as if it were a concentration of that extraordinary atmosphere; as if that
gloomy colour which had changed the night, came from the Child. It seems
impossible to make clear to you; but try to understand it.</p>

<p>"The Child went past me, running, with the natural movement of the legs of a
chubby human child, but in an absolute and inconceivable silence. It was a very
small Child, and must have passed under the table; but I saw the Child through
the table, as if it had been only a slightly darker shadow than the coloured
gloom. In the same instant, I saw that a fluctuating shimmer of violet light
outlined the metal of the gun-barrels and the blade of the sword-bayonet,
making them seem like faint shapes of glimmering light, floating unsupported
where the table-top should have shown solid.</p>

<p>"Now, curiously, as I saw these things, I was subconsciously aware that I
heard the anxious breathing of the landlord, quite clear and laboured, close to
my elbow, where he waited nervously, with his hands on the lantern. I realised
in that moment that he saw nothing; but waited in the darkness for my warning
to come true.</p>

<p>"Even as I took heed of these minor things, I saw the Child jump to one
side, and hide behind some half-seen object, that was certainly nothing
belonging to the passage. I stared, intently, with a most extraordinary thrill
of expectant wonder, with fright making goose-flesh of my back. And even as I
stared, I solved for myself the less important problem of what the two black
clouds were that hung over a part of the table. I think it is very curious and
interesting, that double working of the mind, often so much more apparent
during times of stress. The two clouds came from two faintly shining shapes,
which I knew must be the metal of the lanterns; and the things that looked
black to the sight with which I was then seeing, could be nothing else but what
to normal human sight is known as light. This phenomenon I have always
remembered. I have twice seen a somewhat similar thing; in The Dark Light Case
and in that trouble of Maaetheson's, which you know about.</p>

<p>"Even as I understood this matter of the lights, I was looking to my left,
to understand why the Child was hiding. And suddenly, I heard the landlord
shout out:&mdash;'The Woman!' But I saw nothing. I had a disagreeable sense
that something repugnant was near me, and I was aware in the same moment that
the landlord was gripping my arm in a hard, frightened grip. Then I was looking
back to where the Child had hidden. I saw the Child peeping out from behind its
hiding-place, seeming to be looking up the passage; but whether in fear I could
not tell. Then it came out, and ran headlong away, through the place where
should have been the wall of my Mother's bedroom; but the sense with which I
was seeing these things, showed me the wall only as a vague, upright shadow,
unsubstantial. And immediately the Child was lost to me, in the dull violet
gloom. At the same time, I felt the landlord press back against me, as if
something passed close to him; and he called out again, a hoarse sort of
cry:&mdash;'The Woman! The Woman!' and turned the shade clumsily from off his
lantern. But I had seen no Woman; and the passage showed empty, as he shone the
beam of his light jerkily to and fro; but chiefly in the direction of the
doorway of my Mother's room.</p>

<p>"He was still clutching my arm, and had risen to his feet; and now,
mechanically and almost slowly, I picked up my lantern and turned on the light.
I shone it, a little dazedly, at the seals upon the doors; but none were
broken; then I sent the light to and fro, up and down the passage; but there
was nothing; and I turned to the landlord, who was saying something in a rather
incoherent fashion. As my light passed over his face I noted, in a dull sort of
way, that he was drenched with sweat.</p>

<p>"Then my wits became more handleable, and I began to catch the drift of his
words:&mdash;'Did you see her? Did you see her?' he was saying, over and over
again; and then I found myself telling him, in quite a level voice, that I had
not seen any Woman. He became more coherent then, and I found that he had seen
a Woman come from the end of the passage, and go past us; but he could not
describe her, except that she kept stopping and looking about her, and had even
peered at the wall, close beside him, as if looking for something. But what
seemed to trouble him most, was that she had not seemed to see him, at all. He
repeated this so often, that in the end I told him, in an absurd sort of way,
that he ought to be very glad she had not. What did it all mean? was the
question; somehow I was not so frightened, as utterly bewildered. I had seen
less then, than since; but what I had seen, had made me feel adrift from my
anchorage of Reason.</p>

<p>"What did it mean? He had seen a Woman, searching for something. I had not
seen this Woman. I had seen a Child, running away, and hiding from Something or
Someone. He had not seen the Child, or the other things&mdash;only the Woman.
And I had not seen her. What did it all mean?</p>

<p>"I had said nothing to the landlord about the Child. I had been too
bewildered, and I realised that it would be futile to attempt an explanation.
He was already stupid with the thing he had seen; and not the kind of man to
understand. All this went through my mind as we stood there, shining the
lanterns to and fro. All the time, intermingled with a streak of practical
reasoning, I was questioning myself, what did it all mean? What was the Woman
searching for; what was the Child running from?</p>

<p>"Suddenly, as I stood there, bewildered and nervous, making random answers
to the landlord, a door was violently slammed, and directly I caught the
horrible reek of which I have told you.</p>

<p>"'There!' I said to the landlord, and caught his arm, in my turn. 'The
smell! Do you smell it?'</p>

<p>"He looked at me so stupidly that in a sort of nervous anger I shook
him.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said, in a queer voice, trying to shine the light from his
shaking lantern at the stair-head.</p>

<p>"'Come on!' I said, and picked up my bayonet; and he came, carrying his gun
awkwardly. I think he came, more because he was afraid to be left alone, than
because he had any pluck left, poor beggar. I never sneer at that kind of funk,
at least very seldom; for when it takes hold of you, it makes rags of your
courage.</p>

<p>"I led the way downstairs, shining my light into the lower passage, and
afterwards at the doors to see whether they were shut; for I had closed and
latched them, placing a corner of a mat against each door, so I should know
which had been opened.</p>

<p>"I saw at once that none of the doors had been opened; then I threw the beam
of my light down alongside the stairway, in order to see the mat I had placed
against the door at the top of the cellar stairs. I got a horrid thrill; for
the mat was flat. I paused a couple of seconds, shining my light to and fro in
the passage, and holding fast to my courage, I went down the stairs.</p>

<p>"As I came to the bottom step, I saw patches of wet all up and down the
passage. I shone my lantern on them. It was the imprint of a wet foot on the
oilcloth of the passage; not an ordinary footprint, but a queer, soft, flabby,
spreading imprint, that gave me a feeling of extraordinary horror.</p>

<p>"Backward and forward I flashed the light over the impossible footprints and
saw them everywhere. Suddenly I noticed that they led to each of the closed
doors. I felt something touch my back, and glanced round swiftly, to find that
the landlord had come close to me, almost pressing against me in his fear.</p>

<p>"'It's all right,' I said, but in a rather breathless whisper, meaning to
put a little courage into him; for I could feel that he was shaking through all
his body. Even then as I tried to get him steadied enough to be of some use,
his gun went off with a tremendous bang. He jumped, and yelled with sheer
terror; and I swore because of the shock.</p>

<p>"'Give it to me, for God's sake!' I said, and slipped the gun from his hand;
and in the same instant there was a sound of running steps up the garden path,
and immediately the flash of a bull's-eye lantern upon the fanlight over the
front door. Then the door was tried, and directly afterwards there came a
thunderous knocking, which told me a policeman had heard the shot.</p>

<p>"I went to the door and opened it. Fortunately the constable knew me, and
when I had beckoned him in, I was able to explain matters in a very short time.
While doing this, Inspector Johnstone came up the path, having missed the
officer, and seeing lights and the open door. I told him as briefly as possible
what had occurred, but did not mention the Child or the Woman; for it would
have seemed too fantastic for him to notice. I showed him the queer, wet
footprints and how they went towards the closed doors. I explained quickly
about the mats, and how that the one against the cellar door was flat, which
showed that the door had been opened.</p>

<p>"The inspector nodded, and told the constable to guard the door at the top
of the cellar stairs. He then asked the hall lamp to be lit, after which he
took the policeman's lantern, and led the way into the front room. He paused
with the door wide open, and threw the light all round; then jumped into the
room, and looked behind the door; there was no one there; but all over the
polished oak floor, between the scattered rugs, went the marks of those
horrible spreading footprints; and the room permeated with the horrible
odour.</p>

<p>"The inspector searched the room carefully, and then went into the middle
room, using the same precautions. There was nothing in the middle room, or in
the kitchen and pantry; but everywhere went the wet footmarks through all the
rooms, showing plainly wherever there was woodwork or oilcloth, and always
there was the smell.</p>

<p>"The inspector ceased from his search of the rooms, and spent a minute in
trying whether the mats would really fall flat when the doors were open, or
merely ruckle up in a way as to appear they had been untouched; but in each
case the mats fell flat, and remained so.</p>

<p>"'Extraordinary!' I heard Johnstone mutter to himself. And then he went
towards the cellar door. He had inquired at first whether there were windows to
the cellar, and when he learned that there was no way out, except by the door,
he had left this part of the search to the last.</p>

<p>"As Johnstone came up to the door, the policeman made a motion of salute,
and said something in a low voice; and something in the tone made me flick my
light across him. I saw then that the man was very white, and he looked strange
and bewildered.</p>

<p>"'What?' said Johnstone, impatiently. 'Speak up!'</p>

<p>"'A woman come along 'ere, sir, and went through this 'ere door,' said the
constable, clearly, but with that curious monotonous intonation that is
sometimes heard from an unintelligent man.</p>

<p>"'Speak up!' shouted the inspector.</p>

<p>"'A woman come along and went through this 'ere door,' repeated the man,
monotonously.</p>

<p>"The inspector caught the man by the shoulder, and deliberately sniffed his
breath.</p>

<p>"'No!' he said. And then sarcastically:&mdash;'I hope you held the door open
politely for the lady.'</p>

<p>"'The door weren't opened, sir,' said the man, simply.</p>

<p>"'Are you mad&mdash;' began Johnstone.</p>

<p>"'No,' said the landlord's voice from the back, speaking steadily enough. 'I
saw the Woman upstairs.' It was evident that he had got back his control
again.</p>

<p>"'I'm afraid, Inspector Johnstone,' I said, 'that there's more in this than
you think. I certainly saw some very extraordinary things upstairs.'</p>

<p>"The inspector seemed about to say something; but instead, he turned again
to the door, and flashed his light down and round about the mat. I saw then
that the strange, horrible footmarks came straight up to the cellar door; and
the last print showed under the door; yet the policeman said the door had not
been opened.</p>

<p>"And suddenly, without any intention, or realisation of what I was saying, I
asked the landlord:</p>

<p>"'What were the feet like?'</p>

<p>"I received no answer; for the inspector was ordering the constable to open
the cellar door, and the man was not obeying. Johnstone repeated the order, and
at last, in a queer automatic way, the man obeyed, and pushed the door open.
The loathsome smell beat up at us, in a great wave of horror, and the inspector
came backward a step.</p>

<p>"'My God!' he said, and went forward again, and shone his light down the
steps; but there was nothing visible, only that on each step showed the
unnatural footprints.</p>

<p>"The inspector brought the beam of the light vividly on to the top step; and
there, clear in the light, there was something small, moving. The inspector
bent to look, and the policeman and I with him. Now I don't want to disgust
you; but the thing was a maggot. The policeman backed suddenly out of the
doorway.</p>

<p>"'The church-yard,' he said, '...at the back of the 'ouse.'</p>

<p>"'Silence!' said Johnstone, with a queer break in the word, and I knew that
at last he was frightened. He put his lantern into the doorway, and shone it
from step to step, following the footprints down into the darkness; then he
stepped back from the open doorway, and we all gave back with him. He looked
round, and I had a feeling that he was looking for a weapon of some kind.</p>

<p>"'Your gun,' I said to the landlord, and he brought it from the front hall,
and passed it over to the inspector, who took it and ejected the empty shell
from the right barrel. He held out his hand for a live cartridge, which the
landlord brought from his pocket. He loaded the gun and snapped the breach. He
turned to the constable:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Come on,' he said, and moved towards the cellar doorway.</p>

<p>"'I ain't comin', sir,' said the policeman, very white in the face.</p>

<p>"With a sudden blaze of passion, the inspector took the man by the scruff,
and hove him bodily down into the darkness, and he went downward, screaming.
The inspector followed him instantly, with his lantern and the gun; and I after
the inspector, with the bayonet ready. Behind me I heard the landlord.</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the stairs the inspector was helping the policeman to his
feet, where he stood swaying a moment, in a bewildered fashion; then the
inspector went into the front cellar, and his man followed him in a stupid
fashion; but evidently no longer with any thought of running away from the
horror.</p>

<p>"We all crowded into the front cellar, flashing our lights to and fro.
Inspector Johnstone was examining the floor, and I saw that the footmarks went
all round the cellar, into all the corners, and across the floor. I thought
suddenly of the Child that was running away from Something. Do you see the
thing that I was seeing vaguely?</p>

<p>"We went out of the cellar in a body, for there was nothing to be found. In
the next cellar, the footprints went everywhere in that queer erratic fashion,
as of someone searching for something, or following some blind scent.</p>

<p>"In the third cellar the prints ended at the shallow well that had been the
old water-supply of the little house. The well was full to the brim, and the
water so clear that the pebbly bottom was plainly to be seen, as we shone the
lights into the water. The search came to an abrupt end, and we stood about the
well, looking at one another, in an absolute, horrible silence.</p>

<p>"Johnstone made another examination of the footprints; then he shone his
light again into the clear shallow water, searching each inch of the
plainly-seen bottom; but there was nothing there. The cellar was full of the
dreadful smell; and everyone stood silent, except for the constant turning of
the lamps to and fro around the cellar.</p>

<p>"The inspector looked up from his search of the well, and nodded quietly
across at me, with his sudden acknowledgment that our belief was now his
belief, the smell in the cellar seemed to grow more dreadful, and to be, as it
were, a menace&mdash;the material expression that some monstrous thing was
there with us, invisible.</p>

<p>"'I think&mdash;' began the inspector, and shone his light towards the
stairway; and at this the constable's restraint went utterly, and he ran for
the stairs, making a queer sound in his throat.</p>

<p>"The landlord followed, at a quick walk, and then the inspector and I. He
waited a single instant for me, and we went up together, treading on the same
steps, and with our lights held backwards. At the top, I slammed and locked the
stair door, and wiped my forehead, and my hands were shaking.</p>

<p>"The inspector asked me to give his man a glass of whisky, and then he sent
him out on his beat. He stayed a short while with the landlord and me, and it
was arranged that he would join us the following night, and watch the well with
us from midnight until daylight. Then he left us, just as the dawn was coming
in. The landlord and I locked up the house, and went over to his place for a
sleep.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon, the landlord and I returned to the house, to make
arrangements for the night. He was very quiet, and I felt that he was to be
relied on, now that he had been 'salted,' as it were, with his fright of the
previous night.</p>

<p>"We opened all the doors and windows, and blew the house through very
thoroughly; and in the meanwhile, we lit the lamps in the house, and took them
down into the cellars, where we set them all about, so as to have light
everywhere. Then we carried down three chairs and a table, and set them in the
cellar where the well was sunk. After that, we stretched thin piano wire across
the cellar, about nine inches from the floor, at such a height that it should
catch anything moving about in the dark.</p>

<p>"When this was done, I went through the house with the landlord, and sealed
every window and door in the place, excepting only the front door and the door
at the top of the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, a local wire-smith was making something to my order; and when
the landlord and I had finished tea at his house, we went down to see how the
smith was getting on.</p>

<p>"We found the thing completed. It looked rather like a huge parrot's cage,
without any bottom, of very heavy gauge wire, and stood about seven feet high,
and was four feet in diameter. Fortunately, I remembered to have it made
longitudinally in two halves, or else we should never have got it through the
doorways and down the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>"I told the wire-smith to bring the cage up to the house right away so that
he could fit the two halves rigidly together. As we returned, I called in at an
ironmongers, where I bought some thin hemp rope and an iron rack-pulley, like
those used in Lancashire for hauling up the ceiling clothes-racks, which you
will find in every cottage. I bought also a couple of pitchforks.</p>

<p>"We shan't want to touch it,' I said to the landlord; and he nodded, rather
white all at once.</p>

<p>"As soon as the cage arrived and been fitted together in the cellar, I sent
away the smith; and the landlord and I suspended it over the well, into which
it fitted easily. After a lot of trouble, we managed to hang it so perfectly
central from the rope over the iron pulley, that when hoisted to the ceiling,
and dropped, it went every time plunk into the well, like a
candle-extinguisher. When we had it finally arranged, I hoisted it up once
more, to the ready position, and made the rope fast to a heavy wooden pillar,
which stood in the middle of the cellar.</p>

<p>"By ten o'clock, I had everything arranged, with the two pitchforks and the
two police lanterns; also some whisky and sandwiches. Underneath the table I
had several buckets full of disinfectant.</p>

<p>"A little after eleven o'clock, there was a knock at the front door, and
when I went, I found that Inspector Johnstone had arrived, and brought with him
one of his plain-clothes men. You will understand how pleased I was to see
there would be this addition to our watch; for he looked a tough, nerveless
man, brainy and collected; and one I should have picked to help us with the
horrible job I felt pretty sure we should have to do that night.</p>

<p>"When the inspector and the detective had entered, I shut and locked the
front door; then, while the inspector held the light, I sealed the door
carefully with tape and wax. At the head of the cellar stairs, I shut and
locked that door also, and sealed it in the same way.</p>

<p>"As we entered the cellar, I warned Johnstone and his man to be careful not
to fall over the wires; and then, as I saw his surprise at my arrangements, I
began to explain my ideas and intentions, to all of which he listened with
strong approval. I was pleased to see also that the detective was nodding his
head, as I talked, in a way that showed he appreciated all my precautions.</p>

<p>"As he put his lantern down, the inspector picked up one of the pitchforks,
and balanced it in his hand; then looked at me, and nodded.</p>

<p>"'The best thing,' he said. 'I only wish you'd got two more.'</p>

<p>"Then we all took our seats, the detective getting a washing-stool from the
corner of the cellar. From then, until a quarter to twelve, we talked quietly,
whilst we made a light supper of whisky and sandwiches; after which we cleared
everything off the table, excepting the lanterns and the pitchforks. One of the
latter, I handed to the inspector; the other I took myself, and then, having
set my chair so as to be handy to the rope which lowered the cage into the
well, I went round the cellar and put out every lamp.</p>

<p>"I groped my way to my chair, and arranged the pitchfork and the dark
lantern ready to my hand; after which I suggested that everyone should keep an
absolute silence throughout the watch. I asked, also, that no lantern should be
turned on, until I gave the word.</p>

<p>"I put my watch on the table, where a faint glow from my lantern made me
able to see the time. For an hour nothing happened and everyone kept an
absolute silence, except for an occasional uneasy movement.</p>

<p>"About half-past one, however, I was conscious again of the same
extraordinary and peculiar nervousness, which I had felt on the previous night.
I put my hand out quickly, and eased the hitched rope from around the pillar.
The inspector seemed aware of the movement; for I saw the faint light from his
lantern, move a little, as if he had suddenly taken hold of it, in
readiness.</p>

<p>"A minute later, I noticed there was a change in the colour of the night in
the cellar, and it grew slowly violet-tinted upon my eyes. I glanced to and
fro, quickly, in the new darkness, and even as I looked, I was conscious that
the violet colour deepened. In the direction of the well, but seeming to be at
a great distance, there was, as it were, a nucleus to the change; and the
nucleus came swiftly towards us, appearing to come from a great space, almost
in a single moment. It came near, and I saw again that it was a little naked
Child, running, and seeming to be of the violet night in which it ran.</p>

<p>"The Child came with a natural running movement, exactly as I described it
before; but in a silence so peculiarly intense, that it was as if it brought
the silence with it. About half-way between the well and the table, the Child
turned swiftly, and looked back at something invisible to me; and suddenly it
went down into a crouching attitude, and seemed to be hiding behind something
that showed vaguely; but there was nothing there, except the bare floor of the
cellar; nothing, I mean, of our world.</p>

<p>"I could hear the breathing of the three other men, with a wonderful
distinctness; and also the tick of my watch upon the table seemed to sound as
loud and slow as the tick of an old grandfather's clocks. Someway I knew that
none of the others saw what I was seeing.</p>

<p>"Abruptly, the landlord, who was next to me, let out his breath with a
little hissing sound; I knew then that something was visible to him. There came
a creak from the table, and I had a feeling that the inspector was leaning
forward, looking at something that I could not see. The landlord reached out
his hand through the darkness, and fumbled a moment to catch my arm:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The Woman!' he whispered, close to my ear. 'Over by the well.'</p>

<p>"I stared hard in that direction; but saw nothing, except that the violet
colour of the cellar seemed a little duller just there.</p>

<p>"I looked back quickly to the vague place where the Child was hiding. I saw
that it was peering backward from its hiding-place. Suddenly it rose and ran
straight for the middle of the table, which showed only as vague shadow
half-way between my eyes and the unseen floor. As the Child ran under the
table, the steel prongs of my pitchfork glimmered with a violet, fluctuating
light. A little way off, there showed high up in the gloom, the vaguely shining
outline of the other fork, so I knew the inspector had it raised in his hand,
ready. There was no doubt but that he saw something. On the table, the metal of
the five lanterns shone with the same strange glow; and about each lantern
there was a little cloud of absolute blackness, where the phenomenon that is
light to our natural eyes, came through the fittings; and in this complete
blackness, the metal of each lantern showed plain, as might a cat's-eye in a
nest of black cotton-wool.</p>

<p>"Just beyond the table, the Child paused again, and stood, seeming to
oscillate a little upon its feet, which gave the impression that it was lighter
and vaguer than a thistledown; and yet, in the same moment, another part of me
seemed to know that it was to me, as something that might be beyond thick,
invisible glass, and subject to conditions and forces that I was unable to
comprehend.</p>

<p>"The Child was looking back again, and my gaze went the same way. I stared
across the cellar, and saw the cage hanging clear in the violet light, every
wire and tie outlined with its glimmering; above it there was a little space of
gloom, and then the dull shining of the iron pulley which I had screwed into
the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I stared in a bewildered way round the cellar; there were thin lines of
vague fire crossing the floor in all directions; and suddenly I remembered the
piano wire that the landlord and I had stretched. But there was nothing else to
be seen, except that near the table there were indistinct glimmerings of light,
and at the far end the outline of a dull-glowing revolver, evidently in the
detective's pocket. I remember a sort of subconscious satisfaction, as I
settled the point in a queer automatic fashion. On the table, near to me, there
was a little shapeless collection of the light; and this I knew, after an
instant's consideration, to be the steel portions of my watch.</p>

<p>"I had looked several times at the Child, and round the cellar, whilst I was
deciding these trifles; and had found it still in that attitude of hiding from
something. But now, suddenly, it ran clear away into the distance, and was
nothing more than a slightly deeper coloured nucleus far away in the
strange-coloured atmosphere.</p>

<p>"The landlord gave out a queer little cry, and twisted over against me, as
if to avoid something. From the inspector there came a sharp breathing sound,
as if he had been suddenly drenched with cold water. Then suddenly the violet
colour went out of the night, and I was conscious of the nearness of something
monstrous and repugnant.</p>

<p>"There was a tense silence, and the blackness of the cellar seemed absolute,
with only the faint glow about each of the lanterns on the table. Then, in the
darkness and the silence, there came a faint tinkle of water from the well, as
if something were rising noiselessly out of it, and the water running back with
a gentle tinkling. In the same instant, there came to me a sudden waft of the
awful smell.</p>

<p>"I gave a sharp cry of warning to the inspector, and loosed the rope. There
came instantly the sharp splash of the cage entering the water; and then, with
a stiff, frightened movement I opened the shutter of my lantern, and shone the
light at the cage, shouting to the others to do the same.</p>

<p>"As my light struck the cage, I saw that about two feet of it projected from
the top of the well, and there was something protruding up out of the water,
into the cage. I stared, with a feeling that I recognised the thing; and then,
as the other lanterns were opened, I saw that it was a leg of mutton. The thing
was held by a brawny fist and arm, that rose out of the water. I stood utterly
bewildered, watching to see what was coming. In a moment there rose into view a
great bearded face, that I felt for one quick instant was the face of a drowned
man, long dead. Then the face opened at the mouth-part, and spluttered and
coughed. Another big hand came into view, and wiped the water from the eyes,
which blinked rapidly, and then fixed themselves into a stare at the
lights.</p>

<p>"From the detective there came a sudden shout:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Captain Tobias!' he shouted, and the inspector echoed him; and instantly
they burst into loud roars of laughter.</p>

<p>"The inspector and the detective ran across the cellar to the cage; and I
followed, still bewildered. The man in the cage was keeping the leg of mutton
as far away from him, as possible, and holding his nose.</p>

<p>"'Lift thig dam trap, quig!' he shouted in a stifled voice; but the
inspector and the detective simply doubled before him, and tried to hold their
noses, while they laughed, and the light from their lanterns went dancing all
over the place.</p>

<p>"'Quig! Quig!' said the man in the cage, still holding his nose, and trying
to speak plainly.</p>

<p>"Then Johnstone and the detective stopped laughing, and lifted the cage. The
man in the well threw the leg across the cellar, and turned swiftly to go down
into the well; but the officers were too quick for him, and had him out in a
twinkling. Whilst they held him, dripping upon the floor, the inspector jerked
his thumb in the direction of the offending leg, and the landlord, having
harpooned it with one of the pitchforks, ran it upstairs and so into the open
air.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I had given the man from the well a stiff tot of whisky; for
which he thanked me with a cheerful nod, and having emptied the glass at a
draught, held out his hand for the bottle, which he finished, as if it had been
so much water.</p>

<p>"As you will remember, it was a Captain Tobias who had been the previous
tenant; and this was the very man, who had appeared from the well. In the
course of the talk that followed, I learned the reason for Captain Tobias
leaving the house; He had been wanted by the police for smuggling. He had
undergone imprisonment; and had been released only a couple of weeks
earlier.</p>

<p>"He had returned to find new tenants in his old home. He had entered the
house through the well, the walls of which were not continued right to the
bottom (this I will deal with later); and gone up by a little stairway in the
cellar wall, which opened at the top through a panel beside my Mother's
bedroom. This panel was opened, by revolving the left doorpost of the bedroom
door, with the result that the bedroom door always became unlatched, in the
process of opening the panel.</p>

<p>"The Captain complained, without any bitterness, that the panel had warped,
and that each time he opened it, it made a cracking noise. This had been
evidently what I mistook for raps. He would not give his reason for entering
the house; but it was pretty obvious that he had hidden something, which he
wanted to get. However, as he found it impossible to get into the house,
without the risk of being caught, he decided to try to drive us out, relying on
the bad reputation of the house, and his own artistic efforts as a ghost. I
must say he succeeded. He intended then to rent the house again, as before; and
would then, of course have plenty of time to get whatever he had hidden. The
house suited him admirably; for there was a passage&mdash;as he showed me
afterwards&mdash;connecting the dummy well with the crypt of the church beyond
the garden wall; and these, in turn, were connected with certain caves in the
cliffs, which went down to the beach beyond the church.</p>

<p>"In the course of his talk, Captain Tobias offered to take the house off my
hands; and as this suited me perfectly, for I was about stalled with it, and
the plan also suited the landlord, it was decided that no steps should be taken
against him; and that the whole business should be hushed up.</p>

<p>"I asked the captain whether there was really anything queer about the
house; whether he had ever seen anything. He said yes, that he had twice seen a
Woman going about the house. We all looked at one another, when the captain
said that. He told us she never bothered him, and that he had only seen her
twice, and on each occasion it had followed a narrow escape from the Revenue
people.</p>

<p>"Captain Tobias was an observant man; he had seen how I had placed the mats
against the doors; and after entering the rooms, and walking all about them, so
as to leave the foot-marks of an old pair of wet woollen slippers everywhere,
he had deliberately put the mats back as he found them.</p>

<p>"The maggot which had dropped from his disgusting leg of mutton had been an
accident, and beyond even his horrific planning. He was hugely delighted to
learn how it had affected us.</p>

<p>"The mouldy smell I had noticed was from the little closed stairway, when
the captain opened the panel. The door-slamming was also another of his
contributions.</p>

<p>"I come now to the end of the captain's ghost-play; and to the difficulty of
trying to explain the other peculiar things. In the first place, it is obvious
that there was something genuinely strange in the house; which made itself
manifest as a Woman. Many people had seen this Woman, under differing
circumstances, so it is impossible to put the thing down to fancy; at the same
time it must seem extraordinary that I should have lived two years in the
house, and see nothing, whilst the policeman saw the Woman, before he had been
there twenty minutes; the landlord, the detective, and the inspector all saw
her.</p>

<p>"I can only suppose that fear was in every case the key, as I might say,
which opened the senses to the presence of the Woman. The policeman was a
highly-strung man, and when he became frightened, was able to see the Woman.
The same reasoning applies all round. I saw nothing, until I became really
frightened; then I saw, not the Woman; but a Child, running away from Something
or Someone. However, I will touch on that later. In short, until a very strong
degree of fear was present, no one was affected by the Force which made Itself
evident, as a Woman. My theory explains why some tenants were never aware of
anything strange in the house, whilst others left immediately. The more
sensitive they were, the less would be the degree of fear necessary to make
them aware of the Force present in the house.</p>

<p>"The peculiar shining of all the metal objects in the cellar, had been
visible only to me. The cause, naturally, I do not know; neither do I know why
I, alone, was able to see the shining."</p>

<p>"The Child," I asked. "Can you explain that part at all? Why you didn't see
the Woman, and why they didn't see the Child. Was it merely the same Force,
appearing differently to different people?"</p>

<p>"No," said Carnacki. "I can't explain that. But I am quite sure that the
Woman and the Child were not only two complete and different entities; but even
they were not in quite the same planes of Existence.</p>

<p>"To give you a root-idea, however, it is held in the Sigsand MS. that a
child 'still-born' is 'snayched bacyk bye thee Haggs.' This is crude; but may
yet contain an elemental truth. Yet, before I attempt to make this clearer, let
me tell you a thought that has often been mine. It may be that physical birth
is but a secondary process; and that prior to the possibility, the
Mother-Spirit searches for, until it finds, the small Element&mdash;the primal
Ego or Child's soul. It may be that a certain waywardness would cause such to
strive to evade capture by the Mother-Spirit. It may have been such a thing as
this, that I saw. I have always tried to think so; but it is impossible to
ignore the sense of repulsion that I felt when the unseen Woman went past me.
This repulsion carries forward the idea suggested in the Sigsand MS., that a
stillborn child is thus, because its ego or spirit has been snatched back by
the 'Haggs.' In other words, by certain of the Monstrocities of the Outer
Circle. The thought is inconceivably terrible, and probably the more so because
it is so fragmentary. It leaves us with the conception of a child's soul adrift
half-way between two lives, and running through by-ways of Eternity from
Something incredible and inconceivable (because not understood) to our
senses.</p>

<p>"The thing is beyond further discussion; for it is futile to attempt to
discuss a thing, to any purpose, of which one has a knowledge so fragmentary as
this. There is one thought, which is often mine. Perhaps there is a
Mother-Spirit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the well?" said Arkright. "How did the captain get in from the other
side?"</p>

<p>"As I said before," answered Carnacki. "The side walls of the well did not
reach to the bottom, so that you had only to dip down into the water, and come
up again on the other side of the wall, under the cellar floor, and so climb
into the passage. Of course, the water was the same height on both sides of the
walls. Don't ask me who made the well-entrance or the little stairway; for I
don't know. The house was very old, as I have told you; and that sort of thing
was useful in the wild old days."</p>

<p>"And the Child." I said, coming back to the thing which chiefly interested
me. "You would say that the birth must have occurred in that house; and in this
way, one might suppose that the house to have become en rapport, if I can use
the word in that way, with the Forces that produced the tragedy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carnacki. "That is, supposing we take the suggestion of the
Sigsand MS., to account for the phenomenon."</p>

<p>"There may be other houses&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"There are," said Carnacki; and stood up.</p>

<p>"Out you go," he said genially, using the recognised formula. And in five
minutes we were on the Embankment, going thoughtfully to our various homes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>No. 6. - THE THING INVISIBLE</h2>

<p>Carnacki had just returned to Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. I was aware of this
interesting fact by reason of the curt and quaintly worded postcard which I was
rereading, and by which I was requested to present myself at his house not
later than seven o'clock on that evening. Mr. Carnacki had, as I and the others
of his strictly limited circle of friends knew, been away in Kent for the past
three weeks; but beyond that, we had no knowledge. Carnacki was genially
secretive and curt, and spoke only when he was ready to speak. When this stage
arrived, I and his three other friends&mdash;Jessop, Arkright, and
Taylor&mdash;would receive a card or a wire, asking us to call. Not one of us
ever willingly missed, for after a thoroughly sensible little dinner Carnacki
would snuggle down into his big armchair, light his pipe, and wait whilst we
arranged ourselves comfortably in our accustomed seats and nooks. Then he would
begin to talk.</p>

<p>Upon this particular night I was the first to arrive and found Carnacki
sitting, quietly smoking over a paper. He stood up, shook me firmly by the
hand, pointed to a chair, and sat down again, never having uttered a word.</p>

<p>For my part, I said nothing either. I knew the man too well to bother him
with questions or the weather, and so took a seat and a cigarette. Presently
the three others turned up and after that we spent a comfortable and busy hour
at dinner.</p>

<p>Dinner over, Carnacki snugged himself down into his great chair, as I have
said was his habit, filled his pipe and puffed for awhile, his gaze directed
thoughtfully at the fire. The rest of us, if I may so express it, made
ourselves cozy, each after his own particular manner. A minute or so later
Carnacki began to speak, ignoring any preliminary remarks, and going straight
to the subject of the story we knew he had to tell:</p>

<p>"I have just come back from Sir Alfred Jarnock's place at Burtontree, in
South Kent," he began, without removing his gaze from the fire. "Most
extraordinary things have been happening down there lately and Mr. George
Jarnock, the eldest son, wired to ask me to run over and see whether I could
help to clear matters up a bit. I went.</p>

<p>"When I got there, I found that they have an old Chapel attached to the
castle which has had quite a distinguished reputation for being what is
popularly termed 'haunted.' They have been rather proud of this, as I managed
to discover, until quite lately when something very disagreeable occurred,
which served to remind them that family ghosts are not always content, as I
might say, to remain purely ornamental.</p>

<p>"It sounds almost laughable, I know, to hear of a long-respected
supernatural phenomenon growing unexpectedly dangerous; and in this case, the
tale of the haunting was considered as little more than an old myth, except
after nightfall, when possibly it became more plausible seeming.</p>

<p>"But however this may be, there is no doubt at all but that what I might
term the Haunting Essence which lived in the place, had become suddenly
dangerous&mdash;deadly dangerous too, the old butler being nearly stabbed to
death one night in the Chapel, with a peculiar old dagger.</p>

<p>"It is, in fact, this dagger which is popularly supposed to 'haunt' the
Chapel. At least, there has been always a story handed down in the family that
this dagger would attack any enemy who should dare to venture into the Chapel,
after nightfall. But, of course, this had been taken with just about the same
amount of seriousness that people take most ghost tales, and that is not
usually of a worryingly _real_ nature. I mean that most people never quite know
how much or how little they believe of matters ab-human or ab-normal, and
generally they never have an opportunity to learn. And, indeed, as you are all
aware, I am as big a skeptic concerning the truth of ghost tales as any man you
are likely to meet; only I am what I might term an unprejudiced skeptic. I am
not given to either believing or disbelieving things 'on principle,' as I have
found many idiots prone to be, and what is more, some of them not ashamed to
boast of the insane fact. I view all reported 'hauntings' as unproven until I
have examined into them, and I am bound to admit that ninety-nine cases in a
hundred turn out to be sheer bosh and fancy. But the hundredth! Well, if it
were not for the hundredth, I should have few stories to tell you&mdash;eh?</p>

<p>"Of course, after the attack on the butler, it became evident that there was
at least 'something' in the old story concerning the dagger, and I found
everyone in a half belief that the queer old weapon did really strike the
butler, either by the aid of some inherent force, which I found them peculiarly
unable to explain, or else in the hand of some invisible thing or monster of
the Outer World!</p>

<p>"From considerable experience, I knew that it was much more likely that the
butler had been 'knifed' by some vicious and quite material human!</p>

<p>"Naturally, the first thing to do, was to test this probability of human
agency, and I set to work to make a pretty drastic examination of the people
who knew most about the tragedy.</p>

<p>"The result of this examination, both pleased and surprised me, for it left
me with very good reasons for belief that I had come upon one of those
extraordinary rare 'true manifestations' of the extrusion of a Force from the
Outside. In more popular phraseology&mdash;a genuine case of haunting.</p>

<p>"These are the facts: On the previous Sunday evening but one, Sir Alfred
Jarnock's household had attended family service, as usual, in the Chapel. You
see, the Rector goes over to officiate twice each Sunday, after concluding his
duties at the public Church about three miles away.</p>

<p>"At the end of the service in the Chapel, Sir Alfred Jarnock, his son Mr.
George Jarnock, and the Rector had stood for a couple of minutes, talking,
whilst old Bellett the butler went 'round, putting out the candles.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, the Rector remembered that he had left his small prayer book on
the Communion table in the morning; he turned, and asked the butler to get it
for him before he blew out the chancel candles.</p>

<p>"Now I have particularly called your attention to this because it is
important in that it provides witnesses in a most fortunate manner at an
extraordinary moment. You see, the Rector's turning to speak to Bellett had
naturally caused both Sir Alfred Jarnock and his son to glance in the direction
of the butler, and it was at this identical instant and whilst all three were
looking at him, that the old butler was stabbed&mdash;there, full in the
candlelight, before their eyes.</p>

<p>"I took the opportunity to call early upon the Rector, after I had
questioned Mr. George Jarnock, who replied to my queries in place of Sir Alfred
Jarnock, for the older man was in a nervous and shaken condition as a result of
the happening, and his son wished him to avoid dwelling upon the scene as much
as possible.</p>

<p>"The Rector's version was clear and vivid, and he had evidently received the
astonishment of his life. He pictured to me the whole affair&mdash;Bellett, up
at the chancel gate, going for the prayer book, and absolutely alone; and then
the _blow_, out of the Void, he described it; and the _force_
prodigious&mdash;the old man being driven headlong into the body of the Chapel.
Like the kick of a great horse, the Rector said, his benevolent old eyes bright
and intense with the effort he had actually witnessed, in defiance of all that
he had hitherto believed.</p>

<p>"When I left him, he went back to the writing which he had put aside when I
appeared. I feel sure that he was developing the first unorthodox sermon that
he had ever evolved. He was a dear old chap, and I should certainly like to
have heard it.</p>

<p>"The last man I visited was the butler. He was, of course, in a frightfully
weak and shaken condition, but he could tell me nothing that did not point to
there being a Power abroad in the Chapel. He told the same tale, in every
minute particle, that I had learned from the others. He had been just going up
to put out the altar candles and fetch the Rector's book, when something struck
him an enormous blow high up on the left breast and he was driven headlong into
the aisle.</p>

<p>"Examination had shown that he had been stabbed by the dagger&mdash;of which
I will tell you more in a moment&mdash;that hung always above the altar. The
weapon had entered, fortunately some inches above the heart, just under the
collarbone, which had been broken by the stupendous force of the blow, the
dagger itself being driven clean through the body, and out through the scapula
behind.</p>

<p>"The poor old fellow could not talk much, and I soon left him; but what he
had told me was sufficient to make it unmistakable that no living person had
been within yards of him when he was attacked; and, as I knew, this fact was
verified by three capable and responsible witnesses, independent of Bellett
himself.</p>

<p>"The thing now was to search the Chapel, which is small and extremely old.
It is very massively built, and entered through only one door, which leads out
of the castle itself, and the key of which is kept by Sir Alfred Jarnock, the
butler having no duplicate.</p>

<p>"The shape of the Chapel is oblong, and the altar is railed off after the
usual fashion. There are two tombs in the body of the place; but none in the
chancel, which is bare, except for the tall candlesticks, and the chancel rail,
beyond which is the undraped altar of solid marble, upon which stand four small
candlesticks, two at each end.</p>

<p>"Above the altar hangs the 'waeful dagger,' as I had learned it was named. I
fancy the term has been taken from an old vellum, which describes the dagger
and its supposed abnormal properties. I took the dagger down, and examined it
minutely and with method. The blade is ten inches long, two inches broad at the
base, and tapering to a rounded but sharp point, rather peculiar. It is
double-edged.</p>

<p>"The metal sheath is curious for having a crosspiece, which, taken with the
fact that the sheath itself is continued three parts up the hilt of the dagger
(in a most inconvenient fashion), gives it the appearance of a cross. That this
is not unintentional is shown by an engraving of the Christ crucified upon one
side, whilst upon the other, in Latin, is the inscription: 'Vengeance is Mine,
I will Repay.' A quaint and rather terrible conjunction of ideas. Upon the
blade of the dagger is graven in old English capitals: I WATCH. I STRIKE. On
the butt of the hilt there is carved deeply a Pentacle.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty accurate description of the peculiar old weapon that has
had the curious and uncomfortable reputation of being able (either of its own
accord or in the hand of something invisible) to strike murderously any enemy
of the Jarnock family who may chance to enter the Chapel after nightfall. I may
tell you here and now, that before I left, I had very good reason to put
certain doubts behind me; for I tested the deadliness of the thing myself.</p>

<p>"As you know, however, at this point of my investigation, I was still at
that stage where I considered the existence of a supernatural Force unproven.
In the meanwhile, I treated the Chapel drastically, sounding and scrutinizing
the walls and floor, dealing with them almost foot by foot, and particularly
examining the two tombs.</p>

<p>"At the end of this search, I had in a ladder, and made a close survey of
the groined roof. I passed three days in this fashion, and by the evening of
the third day I had proved to my entire satisfaction that there is no place in
the whole of that Chapel where any living being could have hidden, and also
that the only way of ingress and egress to and from the Chapel is through the
doorway which leads into the castle, the door of which was always kept locked,
and the key kept by Sir Alfred Jarnock himself, as I have told you. I mean, of
course, that this doorway is the only entrance practicable to material
people.</p>

<p>"Yes, as you will see, even had I discovered some other opening, secret or
otherwise, it would not have helped at all to explain the mystery of the
incredible attack, in a normal fashion. For the butler, as you know, was struck
in full sight of the Rector, Sir Jarnock and his son. And old Bellett himself
knew that no living person had touched him..._'Out of the Void,'_ the Rector
had described the inhumanly brutal attack. 'Out of the Void!' A strange feeling
it gives one&mdash;eh?</p>

<p>"And this is the thing that I had been called in to bottom!</p>

<p>"After considerable thought, I decided on a plan of action. I proposed to
Sir Alfred Jarnock that I should spend a night in the Chapel, and keep a
constant watch upon the dagger. But to this, the old knight&mdash;a little,
wizened, nervous man&mdash;would not listen for a moment. He, at least, I felt
assured had no doubt of the reality of some dangerous supernatural Force a roam
at night in the Chapel. He informed me that it had been his habit every evening
to lock the Chapel door, so that no one might foolishly or heedlessly run the
risk of any peril that it might hold at night, and that he could not allow me
to attempt such a thing after what had happened to the butler.</p>

<p>"I could see that Sir Alfred Jarnock was very much in earnest, and would
evidently have held himself to blame had he allowed me to make the experiment
and any harm come to me; so I said nothing in argument; and presently, pleading
the fatigue of his years and health, he said goodnight, and left me; having
given me the impression of being a polite but rather superstitious, old
gentleman.</p>

<p>"That night, however, whilst I was undressing, I saw how I might achieve the
thing I wished, and be able to enter the Chapel after dark, without making Sir
Alfred Jarnock nervous. On the morrow, when I borrowed the key, I would take an
impression, and have a duplicate made. Then, with my private key, I could do
just what I liked.</p>

<p>"In the morning I carried out my idea. I borrowed the key, as I wanted to
take a photograph of the chancel by daylight. When I had done this I locked up
the Chapel and handed the key to Sir Alfred Jarnock, having first taken an
impression in soap. I had brought out the exposed plate&mdash;in its
slide&mdash;with me; but the camera I had left exactly as it was, as I wanted
to take a second photograph of the chancel that night, from the same
position.</p>

<p>"I took the dark slide into Burtontree, also the cake of soap with the
impress. The soap I left with the local ironmonger, who was something of a
locksmith and promised to let me have my duplicate, finished, if I would call
in two hours. This I did, having in the meanwhile found out a photographer
where I developed the plate, and left it to dry, telling him I would call next
day. At the end of the two hours I went for my key and found it ready, much to
my satisfaction. Then I returned to the castle.</p>

<p>"After dinner that evening, I played billiards with young Jarnock for a
couple of hours. Then I had a cup of coffee and went off to my room, telling
him I was feeling awfully tired. He nodded and told me he felt the same way. I
was glad, for I wanted the house to settle as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"I locked the door of my room, then from under the bed&mdash;where I had
hidden them earlier in the evening&mdash;I drew out several fine pieces of
plate armor, which I had removed from the armory. There was also a shirt of
chain mail, with a sort of quilted hood of mail to go over the head.</p>

<p>"I buckled on the plate armor, and found it extraordinarily uncomfortable,
and over all I drew on the chain mail. I know nothing about armor, but from
what I have learned since, I must have put on parts of two suits. Anyway, I
felt beastly, clamped and clumsy and unable to move my arms and legs naturally.
But I knew that the thing I was thinking of doing called for some sort of
protection for my body. Over the armor I pulled on my dressing gown and shoved
my revolver into one of the side pockets&mdash;and my repeating flash-light
into the other. My dark lantern I carried in my hand.</p>

<p>"As soon as I was ready I went out into the passage and listened. I had been
some considerable time making my preparations and I found that now the big hall
and staircase were in darkness and all the house seemed quiet. I stepped back
and closed and locked my door. Then, very slowly and silently I went downstairs
to the hall and turned into the passage that led to the Chapel.</p>

<p>"I reached the door and tried my key. It fitted perfectly and a moment later
I was in the Chapel, with the door locked behind me, and all about me the utter
dree silence of the place, with just the faint showings of the outlines of the
stained, leaded windows, making the darkness and lonesomeness almost the more
apparent.</p>

<p>"Now it would be silly to say I did not feel queer. I felt very queer
indeed. You just try, any of you, to imagine yourself standing there in the
dark silence and remembering not only the legend that was attached to the
place, but what had really happened to the old butler only a little while gone,
I can tell you, as I stood there, I could believe that something invisible was
coming toward me in the air of the Chapel. Yet, I had got to go through with
the business, and I just took hold of my little bit of courage and set to
work.</p>

<p>"First of all I switched on my light, then I began a careful tour of the
place; examining every corner and nook. I found nothing unusual. At the chancel
gate I held up my lamp and flashed the light at the dagger. It hung there,
right enough, above the altar, but I remember thinking of the word 'demure,' as
I looked at it. However, I pushed the thought away, for what I was doing needed
no addition of uncomfortable thoughts.</p>

<p>"I completed the tour of the place, with a constantly growing awareness of
its utter chill and unkind desolation&mdash;an atmosphere of cold dismalness
seemed to be everywhere, and the quiet was abominable.</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of my search I walked across to where I had left my
camera focused upon the chancel. From the satchel that I had put beneath the
tripod I took out a dark slide and inserted it in the camera, drawing the
shutter. After that I uncapped the lens, pulled out my flashlight apparatus,
and pressed the trigger. There was an intense, brilliant flash, that made the
whole of the interior of the Chapel jump into sight, and disappear as quickly.
Then, in the light from my lantern, I inserted the shutter into the slide, and
reversed the slide, so as to have a fresh plate ready to expose at any
time.</p>

<p>"After I had done this I shut off my lantern and sat down in one of the pews
near to my camera. I cannot say what I expected to happen, but I had an
extraordinary feeling, almost a conviction, that something peculiar or horrible
would soon occur. It was, you know, as if I knew.</p>

<p>"An hour passed, of absolute silence. The time I knew by the far-off, faint
chime of a dock that had been erected over the stables. I was beastly cold, for
the whole place is without any kind of heating pipes or furnace, as I had
noticed during my search, so that the temperature was sufficiently
uncomfortable to suit my frame of mind. I felt like a kind of human periwinkle
encased in boilerplate and frozen with cold and funk. And, you know, somehow
the dark about me seemed to press coldly against my face. I cannot say whether
any of you have ever had the feeling, but if you have, you will know just how
disgustingly unnerving it is. And then, all at once, I had a horrible sense
that something was moving in the place. It was not that I could hear anything
but I had a kind of intuitive knowledge that something had stirred in the
darkness. Can you imagine how I felt?</p>

<p>"Suddenly my courage went. I put up my mailed arms over my face. I wanted to
protect it. I had got a sudden sickening feeling that something was hovering
over me in the dark. Talk about fright! I could have shouted if I had not been
afraid of the noise...And then, abruptly, I heard something. Away up the aisle,
there sounded a dull clang of metal, as it might be the tread of a mailed heel
upon the stone of the aisle. I sat immovable. I was fighting with all my
strength to get back my courage. I could not take my arms down from over my
face, but I knew that I was getting hold of the gritty part of me again. And
suddenly I made a mighty effort and lowered my arms. I held my face up in the
darkness. And, I tell you, I respect myself for the act, because I thought
truly at that moment that I was going to die. But I think, just then, by the
slow revulsion of feeling which had assisted my effort, I was less sick, in
that instant, at the thought of having to die, than at the knowledge of the
utter weak cowardice that had so unexpectedly shaken me all to bits, for a
time.</p>

<p>"Do I make myself clear? You understand, I feel sure, that the sense of
respect, which I spoke of, is not really unhealthy egotism; because, you see, I
am not blind to the state of mind which helped me. I mean that if I had
uncovered my face by a sheer effort of will, unhelped by any revulsion of
feeling, I should have done a thing much more worthy of mention. But, even as
it was, there were elements in the act, worthy of respect. You follow me, don't
you?</p>

<p>"And, you know, nothing touched me, after all! So that, in a little while, I
had got back a bit to my normal, and felt steady enough to go through with the
business without any more funking.</p>

<p>"I daresay a couple of minutes passed, and then, away up near the chancel,
there came again that clang, as though an armored foot stepped cautiously. By
Jove! but it made me stiffen. And suddenly the thought came that the sound I
heard might be the rattle of the dagger above the altar. It was not a
particularly sensible notion, for the sound was far too heavy and resonant for
such a cause. Yet, as can be easily understood, my reason was bound to submit
somewhat to my fancy at such a time. I remember now, that the idea of that
insensate thing becoming animate, and attacking me, did not occur to me with
any sense of possibility or reality. I thought rather, in a vague way, of some
invisible monster of outer space fumbling at the dagger. I remembered the old
Rector's description of the attack on the butler..._of the void_. And he had
described the stupendous force of the blow as being 'like the kick of a great
horse.' You can see how uncomfortably my thoughts were running.</p>

<p>"I felt 'round swiftly and cautiously for my lantern. I found it close to
me, on the pew seat, and with a sudden, jerky movement, I switched on the
light. I flashed it up the aisle, to and fro across the chancel, but I could
see nothing to frighten me. I turned quickly, and sent the jet of light darting
across and across the rear end of the Chapel; then on each side of me, before
and behind, up at the roof and down at the marble floor, but nowhere was there
any visible thing to put me in fear, not a thing that need have set my flesh
thrilling; just the quiet Chapel, cold, and eternally silent. You know the
feeling.</p>

<p>"I had been standing, whilst I sent the light about the Chapel, but now I
pulled out my revolver, and then, with a tremendous effort of will, switched
off the light, and sat down again in the darkness, to continue my constant
watch.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me that quite half an hour, or even more, must have passed,
after this, during which no sound had broken the intense stillness. I had grown
less nervously tense, for the flashing of the light 'round the place had made
me feel less out of all bounds of the normal&mdash;it had given me something of
that unreasoned sense of safety that a nervous child obtains at night, by
covering its head up with the bedclothes. This just about illustrates the
completely human illogicalness of the workings of my feelings; for, as you
know, whatever Creature, Thing, or Being it was that had made that
extraordinary and horrible attack on the old butler, it had certainly not been
visible.</p>

<p>"And so you must picture me sitting there in the dark; clumsy with armor,
and with my revolver in one hand, and nursing my lantern, ready, with the
other. And then it was, after this little time of partial relief from intense
nervousness, that there came a fresh strain on me; for somewhere in the utter
quiet of the Chapel, I thought I heard something. I listened, tense and rigid,
my heart booming just a little in my ears for a moment; then I thought I heard
it again. I felt sure that something had moved at the top of the aisle. I
strained in the darkness, to hark; and my eyes showed me blackness within
blackness, wherever I glanced, so that I took no heed of what they told me; for
even if I looked at the dim loom of the stained window at the top of the
chancel, my sight gave me the shapes of vague shadows passing noiseless and
ghostly across, constantly. There was a time of almost peculiar silence,
horrible to me, as I felt just then. And suddenly I seemed to hear a sound
again, nearer to me, and repeated, infinitely stealthy. It was as if a vast,
soft tread were coming slowly down the aisle.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine how I felt? I do not think you can. I did not move, any
more than the stone effigies on the two tombs; but sat there, _stiffened_. I
fancied now, that I heard the tread all about the Chapel. And then, you know, I
was just as sure in a moment that I could not hear it&mdash;that I had never
heard it.</p>

<p>"Some particularly long minutes passed, about this time; but I think my
nerves must have quieted a bit; for I remember being sufficiently aware of my
feelings, to realize that the muscles of my shoulders _ached_, with the way
that they must have been contracted, as I sat there, hunching myself, rigid.
Mind you, I was still in a disgusting funk; but what I might call the 'imminent
sense of danger' seemed to have eased from around me; at any rate, I felt, in
some curious fashion, that there was a respite&mdash;a temporary cessation of
malignity from about me. It is impossible to word my feelings more clearly to
you, for I cannot see them more clearly than this, myself.</p>

<p>"Yet, you must not picture me as sitting there, free from strain; for the
nerve tension was so great that my heart action was a little out of normal
control, the blood beat making a dull booming at times in my ears, with the
result that I had the sensation that I could not hear acutely. This is a simply
beastly feeling, especially under such circumstances.</p>

<p>"I was sitting like this, listening, as I might say with body and soul, when
suddenly I got that hideous conviction again that something was moving in the
air of the place. The feeling seemed to stiffen me, as I sat, and my head
appeared to tighten, as if all the scalp had grown _tense_. This was so real,
that I suffered an actual pain, most peculiar and at the same time intense; the
whole head pained. I had a fierce desire to cover my face again with my mailed
arms, but I fought it off. If I had given way then to that, I should simply
have bunked straight out of the place. I sat and sweated coldly (that's the
bald truth), with the 'creep' busy at my spine...</p>

<p>"And then, abruptly, once more I thought I heard the sound of that huge,
soft tread on the aisle, and this time closer to me. There was an awful little
silence, during which I had the feeling that something enormous was bending
over toward me, from the aisle...And then, through the booming of the blood in
my ears, there came a slight sound from the place where my camera stood&mdash;a
disagreeable sort of slithering sound, and then a sharp tap. I had the lantern
ready in my left hand, and now I snapped it on, desperately, and shone it
straight above me, for I had a conviction that there was something there. But I
saw nothing. Immediately I flashed the light at the camera, and along the
aisle, but again there was nothing visible. I wheeled 'round, shooting the beam
of light in a great circle about the place; to and fro I shone it, jerking it
here and there, but it showed me nothing.</p>

<p>"I had stood up the instant that I had seen that there was nothing in sight
over me, and now I determined to visit the chancel, and see whether the dagger
had been touched. I stepped out of the pew into the aisle, and here I came to
an abrupt pause, for an almost invincible, sick repugnance was fighting me back
from the upper part of the Chapel. A constant, queer prickling went up and down
my spine, and a dull ache took me in the small of the back, as I fought with
myself to conquer this sudden new feeling of terror and horror. I tell you,
that no one who has not been through these kinds of experiences, has any idea
of the sheer, actual physical pain attendant upon, and resulting from, the
intense nerve strain that ghostly fright sets up in the human system. I stood
there feeling positively ill. But I got myself in hand, as it were, in about
half a minute, and then I went, walking, I expect, as jerky as a mechanical tin
man, and switching the light from side to side, before and behind, and over my
head continually. And the hand that held my revolver sweated so much, that the
thing fairly slipped in my fist. Does not sound very heroic, does it?</p>

<p>"I passed through the short chancel, and reached the step that led up to the
small gate in the chancel rail. I threw the beam from my lantern upon the
dagger. Yes, I thought, it's all right. Abruptly, it seemed to me that there
was something wanting, and I leaned forward over the chancel gate to peer,
holding the light high. My suspicion was hideously correct. _The dagger had
gone._ Only the cross-shaped sheath hung there above the altar.</p>

<p>"In a sudden, frightened flash of imagination, I pictured the thing adrift
in the Chapel, moving here and there, as though of its own volition; for
whatever Force wielded it, was certainly beyond visibility. I turned my head
stiffly over to the left, glancing frightenedly behind me, and flashing the
light to help my eyes. In the same instant I was struck a tremendous blow over
the left breast, and hurled backward from the chancel rail, into the aisle, my
armor clanging loudly in the horrible silence. I landed on my back, and
slithered along on the polished marble. My shoulder struck the corner of a pew
front, and brought me up, half stunned. I scrambled to my feet, horribly sick
and shaken; but the fear that was on me, making little of that at the moment. I
was minus both revolver and lantern, and utterly bewildered as to just where I
was standing. I bowed my head, and made a scrambling run in the complete
darkness and dashed into a pew. I jumped back, staggering, got my bearings a
little, and raced down the center of the aisle, putting my mailed arms over my
face. I plunged into my camera, hurling it among the pews. I crashed into the
font, and reeled back. Then I was at the exit. I fumbled madly in my dressing
gown pocket for the key. I found it and scraped at the door, feverishly, for
the keyhole. I found the keyhole, turned the key, burst the door open, and was
into the passage. I slammed the door and leant hard against it, gasping, whilst
I felt crazily again for the keyhole, this time to lock the door upon what was
in the Chapel. I succeeded, and began to feel my way stupidly along the wall of
the corridor. Presently I had come to the big hall, and so in a little to my
room.</p>

<p>"In my room, I sat for a while, until I had steadied down something to the
normal. After a time I commenced to strip off the armor. I saw then that both
the chain mail and the plate armor had been pierced over the breast. And,
suddenly, it came home to me that the Thing had struck for my heart.</p>

<p>"Stripping rapidly, I found that the skin of the breast over the heart had
just been cut sufficiently to allow a little blood to stain my shirt, nothing
more. Only, the whole breast was badly bruised and intensely painful. You can
imagine what would have happened if I had not worn the armor. In any case, it
is a marvel that I was not knocked senseless.</p>

<p>"I did not go to bed at all that night, but sat upon the edge, thinking, and
waiting for the dawn; for I had to remove my litter before Sir Alfred Jarnock
should enter, if I were to hide from him the fact that I had managed a
duplicate key.</p>

<p>"So soon as the pale light of the morning had strengthened sufficiently to
show me the various details of my room, I made my way quietly down to the
Chapel. Very silently, and with tense nerves, I opened the door. The chill
light of the dawn made distinct the whole place&mdash;everything seeming
instinct with a ghostly, unearthly quiet. Can you get the feeling? I waited
several minutes at the door, allowing the morning to grow, and likewise my
courage, I suppose. Presently the rising sun threw an odd beam right in through
the big, East window, making colored sunshine all the length of the Chapel. And
then, with a tremendous effort, I forced myself to enter.</p>

<p>"I went up the aisle to where I had overthrown my camera in the darkness.
The legs of the tripod were sticking up from the interior of a pew, and I
expected to find the machine smashed to pieces; yet, beyond that the ground
glass was broken, there was no real damage done.</p>

<p>"I replaced the camera in the position from which I had taken the previous
photography; but the slide containing the plate I had exposed by flashlight I
removed and put into one of my side pockets, regretting that I had not taken a
second flash picture at the instant when I heard those strange sounds up in the
chancel.</p>

<p>"Having tidied my photographic apparatus, I went to the chancel to recover
my lantern and revolver, which had both&mdash;as you know&mdash;been knocked
from my hands when I was stabbed. I found the lantern lying, hopelessly bent,
with smashed lens, just under the pulpit. My revolver I must have held until my
shoulder struck the pew, for it was lying there in the aisle, just about where
I believe I cannoned into the pew corner. It was quite undamaged.</p>

<p>"Having secured these two articles, I walked up to the chancel rail to see
whether the dagger had returned, or been returned, to its sheath above the
altar. Before, however, I reached the chancel rail, I had a slight shock; for
there on the floor of the chancel, about a yard away from where I had been
struck, lay the dagger, quiet and demure upon the polished marble pavement. I
wonder whether you will, any of you, understand the nervousness that took me at
the sight of the thing. With a sudden, unreasoned action, I jumped forward and
put my foot on it, to hold it there. Can you understand? Do you? And, you know,
I could not stoop down and pick it up with my hands for quite a minute, I
should think. Afterwards, when I had done so, however, and handled it a little,
this feeling passed away and my Reason (and also, I expect, the daylight) made
me feel that I had been a little bit of an ass. Quite natural, though, I assure
you! Yet it was a new kind of fear to me. I'm taking no notice of the cheap
joke about the ass! I am talking about the curiousness of learning in that
moment a new shade or quality of fear that had hitherto been outside of my
knowledge or imagination. Does it interest you?</p>

<p>"I examined the dagger, minutely, turning it over and over in my hands and
never&mdash;as I suddenly discovered&mdash;holding it loosely. It was as if I
were subconsciously surprised that it lay quiet in my hands. Yet even this
feeling passed, largely, after a short while. The curious weapon showed no
signs of the blow, except that the dull color&mdash;of the blade was slightly
brighter on the rounded point that had cut through the armor.</p>

<p>"Presently, when I had made an end of staring at the dagger, I went up the
chancel step and in through the little gate. Then, kneeling upon the altar, I
replaced the dagger in its sheath, and came outside of the rail again, closing
the gate after me and feeling awarely uncomfortable because the horrible old
weapon was back again in its accustomed place. I suppose, without analyzing my
feelings very deeply, I had an unreasoned and only half-conscious belief that
there was a greater probability of danger when the dagger hung in its five
century resting place than when it was out of it! Yet, somehow I don't think
this is a very good explanation, when I remember the _demure_ look the thing
seemed to have when I saw it lying on the floor of the chancel. Only I know
this, that when I had replaced the dagger I had quite a touch of nerves and I
stopped only to pick up my lantern from where I had placed it whilst I examined
the weapon, after which I went down the quiet aisle at a pretty quick walk, and
so got out of the place.</p>

<p>"That the nerve tension had been considerable, I realized, when I had locked
the door behind me. I felt no inclination now to think of old Sir Alfred as a
hypochondriac because he had taken such hyperseeming precautions regarding the
Chapel. I had a sudden wonder as to whether he might not have some knowledge of
a long prior tragedy in which the dagger had been concerned.</p>

<p>"I returned to my room, washed, shaved and dressed, after which I read
awhile. Then I went downstairs and got the acting butler to give me some
sandwiches and a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"Half an hour later I was heading for Burtontree, as hard as I could walk;
for a sudden idea had come to me, which I was anxious to test. I reached the
town a little before eight thirty, and found the local photographer with his
shutters still up. I did not wait, but knocked until he appeared with his coat
off, evidently in the act of dealing with his breakfast. In a few words I made
clear that I wanted the use of his dark room immediately, and this he at once
placed at my disposal.</p>

<p>"I had brought with me the slide which contained the plate that I had used
with the flashlight, and as soon as I was ready I set to work to develop. Yet,
it was not the plate which I had exposed, that I first put into the solution,
but the second plate, which had been ready in the camera during all the time of
my waiting in the darkness. You see, the lens had been uncapped all that while,
so that the whole chancel had been, as it were, under observation.</p>

<p>"You all know something of my experiments in 'Lightless Photography,' that
is, appreciating light. It was X-ray work that started me in that direction.
Yet, you must understand, though I was attempting to develop this 'unexposed'
plate, I had no definite idea of results&mdash;nothing more than a vague hope
that it might show me something.</p>

<p>"Yet, because of the possibilities, it was with the most intense and
absorbing interest that I watched the plate under the action of the developer.
Presently I saw a faint smudge of black appear in the upper part, and after
that others, indistinct and wavering of outline. I held the negative up to the
light. The marks were rather small, and were almost entirely confined to one
end of the plate, but as I have said, lacked definiteness. Yet, such as they
were, they were sufficient to make me very excited and I shoved the thing
quickly back into the solution.</p>

<p>"For some minutes further I watched it, lifting it out once or twice to make
a more exact scrutiny, but could not imagine what the markings might represent,
until suddenly it occurred to me that in one of two places they certainly had
shapes suggestive of a cross hilted dagger. Yet, the shapes were sufficiently
indefinite to make me careful not to let myself be overimpressed by the
uncomfortable resemblance, though I must confess, the very thought was
sufficient to set some odd thrills adrift in me.</p>

<p>"I carried development a little further, then put the negative into the
hypo, and commenced work upon the other plate. This came up nicely, and very
soon I had a really decent negative that appeared similar in every respect
(except for the difference of lighting) to the negative I had taken during the
previous day. I fixed the plate, then having washed both it and the 'unexposed'
one for a few minutes under the tap, I put them into methylated spirits for
fifteen minutes, after which I carried them into the photographer's kitchen and
dried them in the oven.</p>

<p>"Whilst the two plates were drying the photographer and I made an
enlargement from the negative I had taken by daylight. Then we did the same
with the two that I had just developed, washing them as quickly as possible,
for I was not troubling about the permanency of the prints, and drying them
with spirits.</p>

<p>"When this was done I took them to the window and made a thorough
examination, commencing with the one that appeared to show shadowy daggers in
several places. Yet, though it was now enlarged, I was still unable to feel
convinced that the marks truly represented anything abnormal; and because of
this, I put it on one side, determined not to let my imagination play too large
a part in constructing weapons out of the indefinite outlines.</p>

<p>"I took up the two other enlargements, both of the chancel, as you will
remember, and commenced to compare them. For some minutes I examined them
without being able to distinguish any difference in the scene they portrayed,
and then abruptly, I saw something in which they varied. In the second
enlargement&mdash;the one made from the flashlight negative&mdash;the dagger
was not in its sheath. Yet, I had felt sure it was there but a few minutes
before I took the photograph.</p>

<p>"After this discovery I began to compare the two enlargements in a very
different manner from my previous scrutiny. I borrowed a pair of calipers from
the photographer and with these I carried out a most methodical and exact
comparison of the details shown in the two photographs.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I came upon something that set me all tingling with excitement. I
threw the calipers down, paid the photographer, and walked out through the shop
into the street. The three enlargements I took with me, making them into a roll
as I went. At the corner of the street I had the luck to get a cab and was soon
back at the castle.</p>

<p>"I hurried up to my room and put the photographs way; then I went down to
see whether I could find Sir Alfred Jarnock; but Mr. George Jarnock, who met
me, told me that his father was too unwell to rise and would prefer that no one
entered the Chapel unless he were about.</p>

<p>"Young Jarnock made a half apologetic excuse for his father; remarking that
Sir Alfred Jarnock was perhaps inclined to be a little over careful; but that,
considering what had happened, we must agree that the need for his carefulness
had been justified. He added, also, that even before the horrible attack on the
butler his father had been just as particular, always keeping the key and never
allowing the door to be unlocked except when the place was in use for Divine
Service, and for an hour each forenoon when the cleaners were in.</p>

<p>"To all this I nodded understandingly; but when, presently, the young man
left me I took my duplicate key and made for the door of the Chapel. I went in
and locked it behind me, after which I carried out some intensely interesting
and rather weird experiments. These proved successful to such an extent that I
came out of the place in a perfect fever of excitement. I inquired for Mr.
George Jarnock and was told that he was in the morning room.</p>

<p>"'Come along,' I said, when I had found him. 'Please give me a lift. I've
something exceedingly strange to show you.'</p>

<p>"He was palpably very much puzzled, but came quickly. As we strode along he
asked me a score of questions, to all of which I just shook my head, asking him
to wait a little.</p>

<p>"I led the way to the Armory. Here I suggested that he should take one side
of a dummy, dressed in half plate armor, whilst I took the other. He nodded,
though obviously vastly bewildered, and together we carried the thing to the
Chapel door. When he saw me take out my key and open the way for us he appeared
even more astonished, but held himself in, evidently waiting for me to explain.
We entered the Chapel and I locked the door behind us, after which we carted
the armored dummy up the aisle to the gate of the chancel rail where we put it
down upon its round, wooden stand.</p>

<p>"'Stand back!' I shouted suddenly as young Jarnock made a movement to open
the gate. 'My God, man! you mustn't do that!'</p>

<p>"Do what?" he asked, half-startled and half-irritated by my words and
manner.</p>

<p>"One minute," I said. "Just stand to the side a moment, and watch."</p>

<p>He stepped to the left whilst I took the dummy in my arms and turned it to
face the altar, so that it stood close to the gate. Then, standing well away on
the right side, I pressed the back of the thing so that it leant forward a
little upon the gate, which flew open. In the same instant, the dummy was
struck a tremendous blow that hurled it into the aisle, the armor rattling and
clanging upon the polished marble floor.</p>

<p>"Good God!" shouted young Jarnock, and ran back from the chancel rail, his
face very white.</p>

<p>"Come and look at the thing," I said, and led the way to where the dummy
lay, its armored upper limbs all splayed adrift in queer contortions. I stooped
over it and pointed. There, driven right through the thick steel breastplate,
was the 'waeful dagger.'</p>

<p>"Good God!" said young Jarnock again. "Good God! It's the dagger! The
thing's been stabbed, same as Bellett!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, and saw him glance swiftly toward the entrance of the
Chapel. But I will do him the justice to say that he never budged an inch.</p>

<p>"Come and see how it was done," I said, and led the way back to the chancel
rail. From the wall to the left of the altar I took down a long, curiously
ornamented, iron instrument, not unlike a short spear. The sharp end of this I
inserted in a hole in the left-hand gatepost of the chancel gateway. I lifted
hard, and a section of the post, from the floor upward, bent inward toward the
altar, as though hinged at the bottom. Down it went, leaving the remaining part
of the post standing. As I bent the movable portion lower there came a quick
click and a section of the floor slid to one side, showing a long, shallow
cavity, sufficient to enclose the post. I put my weight to the lever and hove
the post down into the niche. Immediately there was a sharp clang, as some
catch snicked in, and held it against the powerful operating spring.</p>

<p>I went over now to the dummy, and after a few minute's work managed to
wrench the dagger loose out of the armor. I brought the old weapon and placed
its hilt in a hole near the top of the post where it fitted loosely, the point
upward. After that I went again to the lever and gave another strong heave, and
the post descended about a foot, to the bottom of the cavity, catching there
with another clang. I withdrew the lever and the narrow strip of floor slid
back, covering post and dagger, and looking no different from the surrounding
surface.</p>

<p>Then I shut the chancel gate, and we both stood well to one side. I took the
spear-like lever, and gave the gate a little push, so that it opened. Instantly
there was a loud thud, and something sang through the air, striking the bottom
wall of the Chapel. It was the dagger. I showed Jarnock then that the other
half of the post had sprung back into place, making the whole post as thick as
the one upon the right-hand side of the gate.</p>

<p>"There!" I said, turning to the young man and tapping the divided post.
"There's the 'invisible' thing that used the dagger, but who the deuce is the
person who sets the trap?" I looked at him keenly as I spoke.</p>

<p>"My father is the only one who has a key," he said. "So it's practically
impossible for anyone to get in and meddle."</p>

<p>I looked at him again, but it was obvious that he had not yet reached out to
any conclusion.</p>

<p>"See here, Mr. Jarnock," I said, perhaps rather curter than I should have
done, considering what I had to say. "Are you quite sure that Sir Alfred is
quite balanced&mdash;mentally?"</p>

<p>"He looked at me, half frightenedly and flushing a little. I realized then
how badly I put it.</p>

<p>"'I&mdash;I don't know,' he replied, after a slight pause and was then
silent, except for one or two incoherent half remarks.</p>

<p>"'Tell the truth,' I said. 'Haven't you suspected something, now and again?
You needn't be afraid to tell me.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' he answered slowly, 'I'll admit I've thought Father a
little&mdash;a little strange, perhaps, at times. But I've always tried to
think I was mistaken. I've always hoped no one else would see it. You see, I'm
very fond of the old guvnor.'</p>

<p>"I nodded.</p>

<p>"'Quite right, too,' I said. 'There's not the least need to make any kind of
scandal about this. We must do something, though, but in a quiet way. No fuss,
you know. I should go and have a chat with your father, and tell him we've
found out about this thing.' I touched the divided post.</p>

<p>"Young Jarnock seemed very grateful for my advice and after shaking my hand
pretty hard, took my key, and let himself out of the Chapel. He came back in
about an hour, looking rather upset. He told me that my conclusions were
perfectly correct. It was Sir Alfred Jarnock who had set the trap, both on the
night that the butler was nearly killed, and on the past night. Indeed, it
seemed that the old gentleman had set it every night for many years. He had
learnt of its existence from an old manuscript book in the Castle library. It
had been planned and used in an earlier age as a protection for the gold
vessels of the ritual, which were, it seemed, kept in a hidden recess at the
back of the altar.</p>

<p>"This recess Sir Alfred Jarnock had utilized, secretly, to store his wife's
jewelry. She had died some twelve years back, and the young man told me that
his father had never seemed quite himself since.</p>

<p>"I mentioned to young Jarnock how puzzled I was that the trap had been set
_before_ the service, on the night that the butler was struck; for, if I
understood him aright, his father had been in the habit of setting the trap
late every night and unsetting it each morning before anyone entered the
Chapel. He replied that his father, in a fit of temporary forgetfulness
(natural enough in his neurotic condition), must have set it too early and
hence what had so nearly proved a tragedy.</p>

<p>"That is about all there is to tell. The old man is not (so far as I could
learn), really insane in the popularly accepted sense of the word. He is
extremely neurotic and has developed into a hypochondriac, the whole condition
probably brought about by the shock and sorrow resultant on the death of his
wife, leading to years of sad broodings and to overmuch of his own company and
thoughts. Indeed, young Jarnock told me that his father would sometimes pray
for hours together, alone in the Chapel." Carnacki made an end of speaking and
leant forward for a spill.</p>

<p>"But you've never told us just _how_ you discovered the secret of the
divided post and all that," I said, speaking for the four of us.</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" replied Carnacki, puffing vigorously at his pipe. "I
found&mdash;on comparing the&mdash;photos, that the one&mdash;taken in
the&mdash;daytime, showed a thicker left-hand gatepost, than the one taken at
night by the flashlight. That put me on to the track. I saw at once that there
might be some mechanical dodge at the back of the whole queer business and
nothing at all of an abnormal nature. I examined the post and the rest was
simple enough, you know.</p>

<p>"By the way," he continued, rising and going to the mantelpiece, "you may be
interested to have a look at the so-called 'waeful dagger.' Young Jarnock was
kind enough to present it to me, as a little memento of my adventure."</p>

<p>He handed it 'round to us and whilst we examined it, stood silent before the
fire, puffing meditatively at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Jarnock and I made the trap so that it won't work," he remarked after a few
moments. "I've got the dagger, as you see, and old Bellett's getting about
again, so that the whole business can be hushed up, decently. All the same I
fancy the Chapel will never lose its reputation as a dangerous place. Should be
pretty safe now to keep valuables in."</p>

<p>"There's two things you haven't explained yet," I said. "What do you think
caused the two clangey sounds when you were in the Chapel in the dark? And do
you believe the soft tready sounds were real, or only a fancy, with your being
so worked up and tense?"</p>

<p>"Don't know for certain about the clangs," replied Carnacki.</p>

<p>"I've puzzled quite a bit about them. I can only think that the spring which
worked the post must have 'given' a trifle, slipped you know, in the catch. If
it did, under such a tension, it would make a bit of a ringing noise. And a
little sound goes a long way in the middle of the night when you're thinking of
'ghostesses.' You can understand that&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed. "And the other sounds?"</p>

<p>"Well, the same thing&mdash;I mean the extraordinary quietness&mdash;may
help to explain these a bit. They may have been some usual enough sound that
would never have been noticed under ordinary conditions, or they may have been
only fancy. It is just impossible to say. They were disgustingly real to me. As
for the slithery noise, I am pretty sure that one of the tripod legs of my
camera must have slipped a few inches: if it did so, it may easily have jolted
the lens cap off the baseboard, which would account for that queer little tap
which I heard directly after."</p>

<p>"How do you account for the dagger being in its place above the altar when
you first examined it that night?" I asked. "How could it be there, when at
that very moment it was set in the trap?"</p>

<p>"That was my mistake," replied Carnacki. "The dagger could not possibly have
been in its sheath at the time, though I thought it was. You see, the curious
cross-hilted sheath gave the appearance of the complete weapon, as you can
understand. The hilt of the dagger protrudes very little above the continued
portion of the sheath&mdash;a most inconvenient arrangement for drawing
quickly!" He nodded sagely at the lot of us and yawned, then glanced at the
clock.</p>

<p>"Out you go!" he said, in friendly fashion, using the recognized formula. "I
want a sleep."</p>

<p>We rose, shook him by the hand, and went out presently into the night and
the quiet of the Embankment, and so to our homes.</p>
