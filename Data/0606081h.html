  <h2><a name="part1"
     id="part1">PART I. &mdash; ADVENTURE ON POLODA</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="fore1"
     id="fore1">FOREWORD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We had attended a party at Diamond Head; and after dinner,
  comfortable on hikiee and easy-chairs on the lanai, we fell to talking about
  the legends and superstitions of the ancient Hawaiians. There were a number
  of old-timers there, several with a mixture of Hawaiian and American blood,
  and we were the only malihinis&mdash;happy to be there, and happy to
  listen.</p>

  <p>Most Hawaiian legends are rather childish, though often amusing; but many
  of their superstitions are grim and sinister&mdash;and they are not confined
  to ancient Hawaiians, either. You couldn't get a modern kane or wahine with a
  drop of Hawaiian blood in his veins to touch the bones or relics still often
  found in hidden burial caves in the mountains. They seem to feel the same way
  about kahunas, and that it is just as easy to be polite to a kahuna as
  not&mdash;and much safer.</p>

  <p>I am not superstitious, and I don't believe in ghosts; so what I heard
  that evening didn't have any other effect on me than to entertain me. It
  couldn't have been connected in any way with what happened later that night,
  for I scarcely gave it a thought after we left the home of our friends; and I
  really don't know why I have mentioned it at all, except that it has to do
  with strange happenings; and what happened later that night certainly falls
  into that category.</p>

  <p>We had come home quite early; and I was in bed by eleven o'clock; but I
  couldn't sleep, and so I got up about midnight, thinking I would work a
  little on the outline of a new story I had in mind.</p>

  <p>I sat in front of my typewriter just staring at the keyboard, trying to
  recall a vagrant idea that I had thought pretty clever at the time, but which
  now eluded me. I stared so long and so steadily that the keys commenced to
  blur and run together.</p>

  <p>A nice white sheet of paper peeped shyly out from the underneath side of
  the platen, a virgin sheet of paper as yet undefiled by the hand of man. My
  hands were clasped over that portion of my anatomy where I once had a
  waistline; they were several inches from the keyboard when the thing
  happened&mdash;the keys commenced to depress themselves with bewildering
  rapidity, and one neat line of type after another appeared upon that virgin
  paper, still undefiled by the hand of man; but who was defiling it? Or
  what?</p>

  <p>I blinked my eyes and shook my head, convinced that I had fallen asleep at
  the typewriter; but I hadn't&mdash;somebody, or something, was typing a
  message there, and typing it faster than any human hands ever typed. I am
  passing it on just as I first saw it, but I can't guarantee that it will come
  to you just as it was typed that night, for it must pass through the hands of
  editors; and an editor would edit the word of God.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-1"
     id="chap1-1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I was shot down behind the German lines in September, 1959.
  Three Messerschmitts had attacked me, but I spun two of them to earth,
  whirling funeral pyres, before I took the last long dive.</p>

  <p>My name is&mdash;well, never mind; my family still retains many of the
  Puritanical characteristics of our revered ancestors, and it is so
  publicity-shy that it would consider a death-notice as verging on the vulgar.
  My family thinks that I am dead; so let it go at that&mdash;perhaps I am. I
  imagine the Germans buried me, anyway.</p>

  <p>The transition, or whatever it was, must have been instantaneous; for my
  head was still whirling from the spin when I opened my eyes in what appeared
  to be a garden. There were trees and shrubs and flowers and expanses of
  well-kept lawn; but what astonished me first was that there didn't seem to be
  any end to the garden&mdash;it just extended indefinitely all the way to the
  horizon, or at least as far as I could see; and there were no buildings nor
  any people.</p>

  <p>At least, I didn't see any people at first; and I was mighty glad of that,
  because I didn't have any clothes on. I thought I must be dead&mdash;I knew I
  must, after what I had been through. When a machine-gun bullet lodges in your
  heart, you remain conscious for about fifteen seconds&mdash;long enough to
  realize that you have already gone into your last spin; but you know you are
  dead, unless a miracle has happened to save you. I thought possibly such a
  miracle might have intervened to preserve me for posterity.</p>

  <p>I looked around for the Germans and for my plane, but they weren't there;
  then, for the first time, I noticed the trees and shrubs and flowers in more
  detail, and I realized that I had never seen anything like them. They were
  not astoundingly different from those with which I had been familiar, but
  they were of species I had never seen or noticed. It then occurred to me that
  I had fallen into a German botanical garden.</p>

  <p>It also occurred to me that it might be a good plan to find out if I was
  badly injured. I tried to stand, and I succeeded; and I was just
  congratulating myself on having escaped so miraculously, when I heard a
  feminine scream.</p>

  <p>I wheeled about, to face a girl looking at me in open-eyed astonishment,
  with just a tinge of terror. The moment I turned, she did likewise and fled.
  So did I; I fled to the concealment of a clump of bushes.</p>

  <p>And then I commenced to wonder. I had never seen a girl exactly like her
  before, nor one garbed as was she. If it hadn't been broad daylight, I would
  have thought she might be going to a fancy dress ball. Her body had been
  sheathed in what appeared to be gold sequins; and she looked as though she
  had either been poured into her costume, or it had been pasted on her bare
  skin. It was undeniably a good fit. From the yoke to a pair of red boots that
  flapped about her ankles and halfway to her knees, she had been clothed in
  sequins.</p>

  <p>Her skin was the whitest I had ever seen on any human being, while her
  hair was an indescribable copper color. I hadn't had a really good look at
  her features; and I really couldn't say that she was beautiful; but just the
  glimpse that I had had assured me that she was no Gorgon.</p>

  <p>After I had concealed myself in the shrubbery, I looked to see what had
  become of the girl; but she was nowhere to be seen. What had become of her?
  Where had she gone? She had simply disappeared.</p>

  <p>All about this vast garden were mounds of earth upon which trees and
  shrubbery grew. They were not very high, perhaps six feet; and the trees and
  shrubbery planted around them so blended into the growth upon them that they
  were scarcely noticeable; but directly in front of me, I noticed an opening
  in one of them; and as I was looking at it, five men came out of it, like
  rabbits out of a warren.</p>

  <p>They were all dressed alike&mdash;in red sequins with black boots; and on
  their heads were large metal helmets beneath which I could see locks of
  yellow hair. Their skin was very white, too, like the girl's. They wore
  swords and were carrying enormous pistols, not quite as large as Tommy guns,
  but formidable-looking, nonetheless.</p>

  <p>They seemed to be looking for someone. I had a vague suspicion that they
  were looking for me...Well, it wasn't such a vague suspicion after all.</p>

  <p>After having seen the beautiful garden and the girl, I might have thought
  that, having been killed, I was in heaven; but after seeing these men garbed
  in red, and recalling some of the things I had done in my past life, I
  decided that I had probably gone to the other place.</p>

  <p>I was pretty well concealed; but I could watch everything they did; and
  when, pistols in hand, they commenced a systematic search of the shrubbery, I
  knew that they were looking for me, and that they would find me; so I stepped
  out into the open.</p>

  <p>At sight of me, they surrounded me, and one of them commenced to fire
  words at me in a language that might have been a Japanese broadcast combined
  with a symphony concert.</p>

  <p>"Am I dead?" I asked.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another; and then they spoke to me again; but I
  couldn't understand a syllable, much less a word, of what they said. Finally
  one of them came up and took me by the arm; and the others surrounded us, and
  they started to lead me away. Then it was that I saw the most amazing thing I
  have ever seen in my life: Out of that vast garden rose buildings! They came
  up swiftly all around us&mdash;buildings of all sizes and shapes, but all
  trim and streamlined, and extremely beautiful in their simplicity; and on top
  of them they carried the trees and the shrubbery beneath which they had been
  concealed.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" I demanded. "Can't any of you speak English, or French, or
  German, or Spanish, or Italian?"</p>

  <p>They looked at me blankly, and spoke to one another in that language that
  did not sound like a language at all. They took me into one of the buildings
  that had risen out of the garden. It was full of people, both men and women;
  and they were all dressed in skin-tight clothing. They looked at me in
  amazement and amusement and disgust; and some of the women tittered and
  covered their eyes with their hands; at last one of my escort found a robe
  and covered me, and I felt very much better. You have no idea what it does to
  one's ego to find oneself in the nude among a multitude of people; and as I
  realized my predicament, I commenced to laugh. My captors looked at me in
  astonishment; they didn't know that I had suddenly realized that I was the
  victim of a bad dream: I had not flown over Germany; I had not been shot
  down; I had never been in a garden with a strange girl...I was just
  dreaming.</p>

  <p>"Run along," I said. "You are just a bad dream. Beat it!" And then I said
  "Boo!" at them, thinking that that would wake me up; but it didn't. It only
  made a couple of them seize me by either arm and hustle me along to a room
  where there was an elderly man seated at a desk. He wore a skin-tight suit of
  black spangles, with white boots.</p>

  <p>My captors spoke to the man at length. He looked at me and shook his head;
  then he said something to them; and they took me into an adjoining room where
  there was a cage, and they put me in the cage and chained me to one of the
  bars.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-2"
     id="chap1-2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I will not bore you with what happened during the ensuing
  six weeks; suffice it to say that I learned a lot from Harkas Yen, the
  elderly man into whose keeping I had been placed. I learned, for instance,
  that he was a psychiatrist, and that I had been placed in his hands for
  observation. When the girl who had screamed had reported me, and the police
  had come and arrested me, they had all thought that I was a lunatic.</p>

  <p>Harkas Yen taught me the language; and I learned it quickly, because I
  have always been something of a linguist. As a child, I traveled much in
  Europe, going to schools in France, Italy and Germany, while my father was
  the military attach at those legations; and so I imagine I developed an
  aptitude for languages.</p>

  <p>He questioned me most carefully when he discovered that the language I
  spoke was wholly unknown in his world, and eventually he came to believe the
  strange story I told him of my transition from my own world to his.</p>

  <p>I do not believe in transmigration, reincarnation or metempsychosis, and
  neither did Harkas Yen; but we found it very difficult to adjust our beliefs
  to the obvious facts of my case. I had been on Earth, a planet of which
  Harkas Yen had not the slightest knowledge; and now I was on Poloda, a planet
  of which I had never heard. I spoke a language that no man on Poloda had ever
  heard, and I could not understand one word of the five principal languages of
  Poloda.</p>

  <p>After a few weeks Harkas Yen took me out of the cage and put me up in his
  own home. He obtained for me a brown sequin suit and a pair of brown boots;
  and I had the run of his house; but I was not permitted to leave it, either
  while it was sunk below ground or while it was raised to the surface.</p>

  <p>That house went up and down at least once a day, and sometimes oftener. I
  could tell when it was going down by the screaming of sirens, and I could
  tell why it was down by the detonation of bursting bombs that shook
  everything in the place.</p>

  <p>I asked Harkas Yen what it was all about, although I could pretty well
  guess by what I had left in the making on Earth; but all he said was: "The
  Kapars."</p>

  <p>After I had learned the language so that I could speak and understand it,
  Harkas Yen announced that I was to be tried.</p>

  <p>"For what?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tangor," he replied, "I guess it is to discover whether you are a
  spy, a lunatic, or a dangerous character who should be destroyed for the good
  of Unis."</p>

  <p>Tangor was the name he had given me. It means from nothing, and he said
  that it quite satisfactorily described my origin; because from my own
  testimony I came from a planet which did not exist. Unis is the name of the
  country to which I had been so miraculously transported. It was not heaven
  and it was certainly not hell, except when the Kapars came over with their
  bombs.</p>

  <p>At my trial there were three judges and an audience; the only witnesses
  were the girl who had discovered me, the five policemen who had arrested me,
  Harkas Yen, his son Harkas Don, his daughter Harkas Yamoda, and his wife. At
  least I thought that those were all the witnesses, but I was mistaken. There
  were seven more, old gentlemen with sparse grey hairs on their
  chins&mdash;you've got to be an old man on Poloda before you can raise a
  beard, and even then it is nothing to brag about.</p>

  <p>The judges were fine-looking men in grey sequin suits and grey boots; they
  were very dignified. Like all the judges in Unis, they are appointed by the
  government for life, on the recommendation of what corresponds to a bar
  association in America. They can be impeached, but otherwise they hold office
  until they are seventy years old, when they can be reappointed if they are
  again recommended by the association of lawyers.</p>

  <p>The session opened with a simple little ritual; everyone rose when the
  judges entered the courtroom; and after they had taken their places, every
  one, including the judges said, "For the honor and glory of Unis," in unison;
  then, I was conducted to the prisoner's dock&mdash;I guess you would call
  it&mdash;and one of the judges asked me my name.</p>

  <p>"I am called Tangor," I replied.</p>

  <p>"From what country do you come?"</p>

  <p>"From the United States of America."</p>

  <p>"Where is that?"</p>

  <p>"On the planet Earth."</p>

  <p>"Where is that?"</p>

  <p>"Now you have me stumped," I said. "If I were on Mercury, Venus, Mars, or
  any other of the planets of our solar system, I could tell you; but not
  knowing where Poloda is, I can only say that I do not know."</p>

  <p>"Why did you appear naked in the limits of Orvis?" demanded one of the
  judges. Orvis is the name of the city into which I had been ruthlessly
  catapulted without clothes. "Is it possible that the inhabitants of this
  place you call America do not wear clothing?"</p>

  <p>"They wear clothing, Most Honorable Judge," I replied (Harkas Yen had
  coached me in the etiquette of the courtroom and the proper way to address
  the judges); "but it varies with the mood of the wearer, the temperature,
  styles, and personal idiosyncrasies. I have seen ancient males wandering
  around a place called Palm Springs with nothing but a pair of shorts to hide
  their hairy obesity; I have seen beautiful women clothed up to the curve of
  the breast in the evening, who had covered only about one per centum of their
  bodies at the beach in the afternoon; but, Most Honorable Judge, I have never
  seen any female costume more revealing than those worn by the beautiful girls
  of Orvis. To answer your first question: I appeared in Orvis naked, because I
  had no clothes when I arrived here."</p>

  <p>"You are excused for a moment," said the judge who had questioned me; then
  he turned to the seven old men, and asked them to take the stand. After they
  had been sworn and he had asked their names, the chief judge asked them if
  they could locate any such world as the Earth.</p>

  <p>"We have questioned Harkas Yen, who has questioned the defendant," replied
  the oldest of the seven, "and we have come to this conclusion." After which
  followed half an hour of astronomical data. "This person," he finished,
  "apparently came from a solar system that is beyond the range of our most
  powerful telescopes, and is probably about twenty-two thousand light-years
  beyond Canapa."</p>

  <p>That was staggering; but what was more staggering was when Harkas Yen
  convinced me that Canapa was identical with the Globular Cluster, N. G. C.
  7006, which is two hundred and twenty thousand light-years distant from the
  Earth and not just a measly twenty-two thousand; and then, to cap the climax,
  he explained that Poloda is two hundred and thirty thousand light-years from
  Canapa, which would locate me something like four hundred and fifty thousand
  light-years from Earth. As light travels 186,000 miles per second, I will let
  you figure how far Poloda is from Earth; but I may say that if a telescope on
  Poloda were powerful enough to see what was transpiring on Earth, they would
  see what was transpiring there four hundred and fifty thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>After they had quizzed the seven astronomers, and learned nothing, one of
  the judges called Balzo Maro to the stand; and the girl I had seen that first
  day in the garden arose from her seat and came forward to the
  witness-stand.</p>

  <p>After they had gone through the preliminaries, they questioned her about
  me. "He wore no clothes?" asked one of the judges.</p>

  <p>"None," said Balzo Maro.</p>

  <p>"Did he attempt to&mdash;ah&mdash;annoy you in any way?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Balzo Maro.</p>

  <p>"You know, don't you," asked one of the judges, "that for wilfully
  annoying a woman, an alien can be sentenced to destruction?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Balzo Maro; "but he did not annoy me. I watched him because I
  thought he might be a dangerous character, perhaps a Kapar spy; but I am
  convinced that he is what he claims to be."</p>

  <p>I could have hugged Balzo Maro.</p>

  <p>Now the judges said to me. "If you are convicted, you may be destroyed or
  imprisoned for the duration; but as the war has now gone into its one hundred
  and first year, such a sentence would be equivalent to death. We wish to be
  fair, and really there is nothing more against you than that you are an alien
  who spoke no tongue known upon Poloda."</p>

  <p>"Then release me and let me serve Unis against her enemies," I made
  answer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-3"
     id="chap1-3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The judges discussed my proposition in whispers for about
  ten minutes; then they put me on probation until the Janhai could decide the
  matter, and after that they turned me back to the custody of Harkas Yen, who
  told me later that a great honor had been done, as the Janhai rules Unis; it
  was like putting my case in the hands of the President of the United States
  or the King of England.</p>

  <p>The Janhai is a commission composed of seven men who are elected to serve
  until they are seventy years old, when they may be re-elected; the word is a
  compound of jan (seven) and hai (elect). Elections are held only when it is
  necessary to fill a vacancy on the Janhai, which appoints all judges and what
  corresponds to our governors of States, who in turn appoint all other State
  or provincial officials and the mayors of cities, the mayors appointing
  municipal officers. There are no ward-heelers in Unis.</p>

  <p>Each member of the Janhai heads a department, of which there are seven:
  War; Foreign, which includes State; Commerce; Interior; Education; Treasury
  and Justice. These seven men elect one of their own number every six years as
  Elianhai, or High Commissioner. He is, in effect, the ruler of Unis but he
  cannot serve two consecutive terms. These men, like all the appointees of the
  Janhai, the provincial governors, and the mayors, must submit to a very
  thorough intelligence test, which determines the candidate's native
  intelligence as well as his fund of acquired knowledge; and more weight is
  given the former than the latter.</p>

  <p>I could not but compare this system with our own, under which it is not
  necessary for a Presidential candidate to be able either to read or write;
  even a congenital idiot could run for the Presidency of the United States of
  America, and serve if he were elected.</p>

  <p>There were two cases following mine, and Harkas Yen wanted to stay and
  hear them. The first was a murder case; and the defendant had chosen to be
  tried before one judge, rather than a jury of five men.</p>

  <p>"He is either innocent, or the killing was justifiable," remarked Harkas
  Yen. "When they are guilty, they usually ask for a jury trial." In a fit of
  passion, the man had killed another who had broken up his home. In fifteen
  minutes he was tried and acquitted.</p>

  <p>The next case was that of the mayor of a small city who was accused of
  accepting a bribe. That case lasted about two hours and was tried before a
  jury of five men. In America, it would possibly have lasted two months. The
  judge made the attorneys stick to facts and the evidence. The jury was out
  not more than fifteen minutes, when it brought in a verdict of guilty. The
  judge sentenced the man to be shot on the morning of the fifth day. This gave
  him time to appeal the case to a court of five judges; they work fast in
  Unis.</p>

  <p>Harkas Yen told me that the court of appeal would examine the transcript
  of the evidence and would probably confirm the finding of the lower court,
  unless the attorney for the defendant made an affidavit that he could bring
  in new evidence to clear his client. It he made such an affidavit, and the
  new evidence failed to alter the verdict, the attorney would forfeit his fee
  to the State and be compelled to pay all court costs for the second
  trial.</p>

  <p>Attorneys' fees, like doctors', are fixed by law in Unis; and they are
  fair&mdash;a rich man pays a little more than a poor man, but they can't take
  his shirt. If a defendant is very poor, the State employs and pays any
  attorney the defendant may select; and the same plan is in effect for the
  services of doctors, surgeons and hospitalization.</p>

  <p>After the second trial I went home with Harkas Yen and his son and
  daughter. While we were walking to the elevators, we heard the wail of
  sirens, and felt thee building dropping down its shaft. It was precisely the
  same sensation I had when coming down in an elevator from the 102nd story of
  the Empire State Building.</p>

  <p>This Justice Building, in which the trials had been held, is twenty
  stories high; and it dropped down to the bottom of its shaft in about twenty
  seconds. Pretty soon we heard the booming of anti-aircraft guns and the
  terrific detonation of bombs.</p>

  <p>"How long has this been going on?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"All my life, and long before," replied Harkas Yen.</p>

  <p>"This war is now in its one hundred and first year," said Harkas Don, his
  son. "We don't know anything else," he added with a grin.</p>

  <p>"It started about the time your grandfather was born," said Harkas Yen.
  "As a boy and young man, your great-grandfather lived in a happier world.
  Then men lived and worked upon the surface of the planet; cities were built
  above-ground; but within ten years after the Kapars launched their campaign
  to conquer and rule the world, every city in Unis and every city in Kapara
  and many cities on others of the five continents were reduced to rubble.</p>

  <p>"It was then that we started building these underground cities that can be
  raised or lowered by the power we derive from Omos." (The Sun of Poloda.)
  "The Kapars have subjugated practically all the rest of Poloda; but we were,
  and still are, the richest nation in the world. What they have done to us, we
  have done to them; but they are much worse off than we. Their people live in
  underground warrens protected by steel and concrete; they subsist upon the
  foods raised by subjugated peoples who are no better than slaves, and work no
  better for hated masters; or they eat synthetic foods, as they wear synthetic
  clothing. They themselves produce nothing but the material of war. So heavily
  do we bomb their land that nothing can live upon its surface; but they keep
  on, for they know nothing but war. Periodically we offer them an honorable
  peace, but they will have nothing but the total destruction of Unis."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-4"
     id="chap1-4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Harkas Yen invited me to remain in his home until some
  disposition of my case was made. His place is reached by an underground
  motorway a hundred feet beneath the surface. Throughout the city many
  buildings were still lower, those more than a hundred feet high having
  entrances at this hundred-foot level as well as at ground level when they
  were raised. The smaller buildings were raised and lowered in shafts like our
  elevator shafts. Above them are thick slabs of armour plate which support the
  earth and top soil in which grow the trees, shrubbery, and grass which hide
  them when they are lowered. When these smaller buildings are raised they come
  in contact with their protecting slabs and carry them on up with them.</p>

  <p>After we left the center of the city I noticed many buildings built
  permanently at the hundred-foot level; and when I asked Harkas Yen about
  this, he explained that when this underground city had first been planned it
  was with the expectation that the war would soon be over and that the city
  could return to normal life at the surface; that when all hope of the war's
  end was abandoned, permanent underground construction was commenced.</p>

  <p>"You can imagine," he continued, "the staggering expense involved in
  building these underground cities. The Janhai of Unis ordered them commenced
  eighty years ago and they are nowhere near completed yet. Hundreds of
  thousands of the citizens of Unis live in inadequate shelters, or just in
  caves or in holes dug in the ground. It is because of this terrific expense
  that, among other things, we wear these clothes we do. They are made of an
  indestructible plastic which resembles metal. No person, not even a member of
  the Janhai, may possess more than three suits, two for ordinary wear and one
  suit of working-clothes, for all productivity must go into the construction
  of our cities and the prosecution of the war. Our efforts cannot be wasted in
  making clothes to meet every change in style and every silly vanity, as was
  true a hundred years ago. About the only things we have conserved from the
  old days, which are not absolutely essential to the winning of the war or the
  construction of our cities, are cultural. We would not permit art, music, and
  literature to die."</p>

  <p>"It must be a hard life," I suggested, "especially for the women. Do you
  have no entertainment nor recreation?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he replied, "but they are simple; we do not devote much time to
  them. Our forebears who lived a hundred years ago would think it a very dull
  life, for they devoted most of their time to the pursuit of pleasure, which
  was one of the reasons that the Kapars prosecuted the war so successfully at
  first, and why almost every nation on Poloda, with the exception of Unis, was
  either subjugated or exterminated by the Kapars."</p>

  <p>The motorcars of Unis are all identical, each one seating four people
  comfortably, or six uncomfortably. This standardization has effected a
  tremendous saving in labour and materials. Power is conducted to their motors
  by what we would call "radio" from central stations where the sun's energy is
  stored. As this source of power is inexhaustible, it has not been necessary
  to curtail the use of motors because of war needs. This same power is also
  used for operating the enormous pumps which are necessary for draining this
  underground world, the mechanism for raising the buildings, and the numerous
  air-conditioning plants which are necessary.</p>

  <p>I was simply appalled by contemplation of the cost of the excavating and
  constructing of a world beneath the surface of the ground, and when I
  mentioned this to Harkas Yen he said: "There never has been enough wealth in
  the world to accomplish what we have accomplished, other than the potential
  wealth which is inherent in the people themselves. By the brains of our
  scientists and our leaders, by the unity of our people, and by the sweat of
  our brows we have done what we have done."</p>

  <p>Harkas Yen's son and daughter, Don and Yamoda, accompanied us from the
  Hall of Justice to their home. Yamoda wore the gold sequins and red boots
  that all unmarried women wear, while Don was in the blue of the fighting
  forces. He and I have hit it off well together, both being flyers; and
  neither of us ever tire of hearing stories of the other's world. He has
  promised to try to get me into the flying service; and Harkas Yen thinks that
  it may be possible, as there is a constant demand for flyers to replace
  casualties, of which there are sometimes as many as five hundred thousand in
  a month.</p>

  <p>These figures staggered me when Harkas Don first mentioned them, and I
  asked him how it was the nation had not long since been exterminated.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see," he said, "they don't average as high as that. I think the
  statistics show that we lose on an average of about a hundred thousand men a
  month. There are sixteen million adult women in Unis and something like ten
  million babies are born every year. Probably a little better than half of
  these are boys. At least five million of them grow to maturity, for we are a
  very healthy race. So, you see, we can afford to lose a million men a
  year."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think the mothers would like that very well," I said.</p>

  <p>"Nobody does," he replied, "but it is war; and war is our way of
  life."</p>

  <p>"In my country," I said, "we have what are known as pacifists, and they
  have a song which is called, 'I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier.'"</p>

  <p>Harkas Don laughed and then said what might be translated into English as:
  "If our women had a song, it would be, 'I didn't raise my son to be a
  slacker.'"</p>

  <p>Harkas Yen's wife greeted me most cordially when I returned. She has been
  very lovely to me and calls me her other boy. She is a sad-faced woman of
  about sixty, who was married at seventeen and has had twenty children, six
  girls and fourteen boys. Thirteen of the boys have been killed in the war.
  Most of the older women of Unis, and the older men, too, have sad faces; but
  they never complain nor do they ever weep. Harkas Yen's wife told me that
  their tears were exhausted two generations ago.</p>

  <p>I didn't get into the flying service, I got into the Labour
  Corps&mdash;and it was labour spelled with all capitals, not just a capital
  L! I had wondered how they repaired the damage done by the continual bombing
  of the Kapars and I found out the first day I was inducted into the Corps.
  Immediately following the departure of the Kapar bombers we scurried out of
  holes in the ground like worker ants. There were literally thousands of us,
  and we were accompanied by trucks, motorized shovels, and scrapers, and an
  ingenious tool for lifting a tree out of the ground with the earth all nicely
  balled around the roots.</p>

  <p>First, we filled the bomb craters, gathering up such plants and trees as
  might be saved. The trucks brought sod, trees, and plants that had been
  raised underground; and within a few hours all signs of the raid had been
  obliterated.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me like a waste of energy; but one of my fellow workers
  explained to me that it had two important purposes&mdash;one was to maintain
  the morale of the Unisans, and the other was to lower the morale of the
  enemy.</p>

  <p>We worked nine days and had one day off, the first day of their ten-day
  week. When we were not working on the surface we were working below-ground;
  and as I was an unskilled laborer, I did enough work in my first month in the
  Labour Corps to last an ordinary man a lifetime. On my third day of rest,
  which came at the end of my first month in the Labour Corps, Harkas Don, who
  was also off duty on that day, suggested that we go to the mountains. He and
  Yamoda got together a party of twelve. Three of the men were from the Labour
  Corps, the other three were in the fighting service. One of the girls was the
  daughter of the Elianhai, whose office is practically that of the President.
  Two of the others were daughters of members of the Labour Corps. There was
  the daughter of a university president, the daughter of an army officer, and
  Yamoda. The sorrow and suffering of perpetual war has developed a national
  unity which has wiped out all class distinction.</p>

  <p>Orvis stands on a plateau entirely surrounded by mountains, the nearest of
  which are about a hundred miles from the city; and it was to these mountains
  that we took an underground train. Here rise the highest peaks in the range
  that surrounds Orvis; and as the mountains at the east end of the plateau are
  low and a wide pass breaks the range at the west end, the Kapars usually come
  and go either from the east or west; so it is considered reasonably safe to
  take an outing on the surface at this location. I tell you it was good to get
  out in the sun again without having to work like a donkey! The country there
  was beautiful; there were mountain streams and there was a little lake beside
  which we planned to picnic in a grove of trees. They had selected the grove
  because the trees would hide us from any chance enemy flyers who might pass
  overhead. For all of the lives of four generations they have had to think of
  this until it is second nature for them to seek shelter when in the open.</p>

  <p>Someone suggested that we swim before we eat. "I'd like nothing better," I
  said, "but I didn't bring any swimming things."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Yamoda.</p>

  <p>"Why, I mean clothes to swim in&mdash;a swimming-suit."</p>

  <p>That made them all laugh. "You have your swimming suit on," said Harkas
  Don, "you were born in it."</p>

  <p>I had lost most of my tan after living underground for a couple of months;
  but I was still very dark compared with these white-skinned people who have
  lived like moles for almost four generations, and my head of black hair
  contrasted strangely with the copper hair of the girls and the blond hair of
  the men.</p>

  <p>The water was cold and refreshing and we came out with enormous appetites.
  After we had eaten we lay around on the grass and they sang the songs that
  they liked.</p>

  <p>Time passed rapidly and we were all startled when one of the men stood up
  and announced that we had better leave for home. He had scarcely finished
  speaking when we heard the report of a pistol shot and saw him pitch forward
  upon his face, dead.</p>

  <p>The three soldiers with us were the only ones who bore arms. They ordered
  us to lie flat on our faces, and then they crept forward in the direction
  from which the sound of the pistol-shot had come. They disappeared in the
  underbrush and shortly afterward we heard a fusillade of shots. This was more
  than I could stand, lying there like a scared rabbit while Harkas Don and his
  companions were out there fighting; so I crawled after them.</p>

  <p>I came up to them on the edge of a little depression in which were perhaps
  a dozen men behind an outcropping of rock which gave them excellent
  protection. Harkas Don and his companions were concealed from the enemy by
  shrubbery, but not protected by it. Every time an enemy showed any part of
  his body one of the three would fire. Finally the man behind the extreme
  right end of the barrier exposed himself for too long; and we were so close
  that I could see the hole the bullet made in his forehead before he fell back
  behind the barrier. Beyond the point where he fell thick trees and underbrush
  concealed the continuation of the outcropping, if there was more, and this
  gave me an idea which I immediately set to work to put into execution.</p>

  <p>I slipped backward a few yards into the underbrush and then crawled
  cautiously to the right. Taking advantage of this excellent cover, I circled
  around until I was opposite the left flank of the enemy; then I wormed myself
  forward on my belly inch by inch until through a tiny opening in the
  underbrush I saw the body of the dead man and, beyond it, his companions
  behind their rocky barrier. They were all dressed in drab, grey uniforms that
  looked like coveralls, and they wore grey metal helmets that covered their
  entire heads and the backs of their necks, leaving only their faces exposed.
  They had crossed shoulder belts and a waist-belt filled with cartridges in
  clips of about fifteen. Their complexions were sallow and unwholesome; and
  though I knew that they must be young men, they looked old; and the faces of
  all of them seemed set in sullen scowls. They were the first Kapars that I
  had seen, but I recognized them instantly from descriptions that Harkas Don
  and others had given me.</p>

  <p>The pistol of the dead man (it was really a small machine-gun) lay at his
  side, and there was almost a full clip of cartridges in it. I could see them
  plainly from where I lay. I pushed forward another inch or two and then one
  of the Kapars turned and looked in my direction. At first I thought that he
  had discovered me, but I presently saw that he was looking at his dead
  comrade. Then he turned and spoke to his companions in a language I could not
  understand; it sounded to me something like the noise that pigs make when
  they eat. One of them nodded to him, evidently in assent, and he turned and
  started to walk toward the dead man. That looked like the end of my little
  scheme, and I was just about to take a desperate chance and make a lunge for
  the pistol when the Kapar foolishly permitted his head to show above the top
  of the barrier, and down he went with a bullet in his head. The other Kapars
  looked at him and jabbered angrily to one another; and while they were
  jabbering I took the chance, extended my arm through the underbrush, grasped
  the pistol and dragged it slowly toward me.</p>

  <p>The Kapars were still arguing, or scolding, or whatever they were doing,
  when I took careful aim at the nearest of them and commenced firing. Four of
  the ten went down before the others realized from what direction the attack
  was coming. Two of them started firing at the underbrush where I was hidden,
  but I brought them down, and then the other four broke and ran. In doing so
  they were exposed to the fire of Harkas Don and his companions, as well as of
  mine, and we got every one of them.</p>

  <p>I had crawled out from the underbrush in order that my friends would not
  get me before they recognized me; so I called Harkas Don by name and
  presently he answered.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Tangor," I replied. "I'm coming out; don't shoot."</p>

  <p>They came over to me then, and we went in search of the Kapar ship, which
  we knew must be near by. We found it in a little natural clearing, half a
  mile back from the place where we had shot them. It was unguarded; so we were
  sure that we had got them all.</p>

  <p>"We are ahead twelve pistols, a lot of ammunition, and one ship," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"We will take the pistols and ammunition back," said Harkas Don, "but no
  one can fly this ship back to Orvis without being killed."</p>

  <p>He found a heavy tool in the ship and demolished the motor.</p>

  <p>Our little outing was over; and we went home, carrying our one dead with
  us.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-5"
     id="chap1-5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The next day, while I was loading garbage on a train that
  was going to the incinerator, a boy in yellow sequins came and spoke to the
  man in charge of us, who turned and called to me. "You are ordered to report
  to the office of the Commissioner for War," he said; "this messenger will
  take you."</p>

  <p>"Hadn't I better change my clothes?" I asked. "I imagine that I don't
  smell very good."</p>

  <p>The boss laughed. "The Commissioner for War has smelled garbage before,"
  he said, "and he doesn't like to be kept waiting." So I went along with the
  yellow-clad messenger to the big building called the House of the Janhai,
  which houses the government of Unis.</p>

  <p>I was conducted to the office of one of the Commissioner's assistants.</p>

  <p>He looked up as we entered. "What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"This is the man for whom you sent me," replied the messenger.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, your name is Tangor. I might have known by that black hair. So
  you're the man who says that he comes from another world, some 548,000
  light-years from Poloda."</p>

  <p>I said that I was. Poloda is four hundred and fifty thousand light-years
  from Earth by our reckoning, but it is 547,500 Polodan light-years, as there
  are only three hundred days in a Polodan year; but what's one hundred
  thousand light-years among friends, anyway?</p>

  <p>"Your exploit of yesterday with the Kapars has been reported to me," said
  the officer, "as was also the fact that you were a flyer in your own world,
  and that you wish to fly for Unis."</p>

  <p>"That is right, sir," I said.</p>

  <p>"In view of the cleverness and courage which you displayed yesterday, I am
  going to permit you to train for the flying force&mdash;if you think you
  would prefer that to shoveling garbage," he added with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I have no complaint to make about shoveling garbage, or anything else
  that I am required to do in Unis, sir," I replied. "I came here an uninvited
  guest, and I have been treated extremely well. I would not complain of any
  service that might be required of me."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you say that," he said. Then he handed me an order for
  a uniform, and gave me directions as to where and to whom to report after I
  had obtained it.</p>

  <p>The officer to whom I reported sent me first to a factory manufacturing
  pursuit-plane motors, where I remained a week; that is, nine working days.
  There are ten assembly lines in this plant and a completed motor comes off of
  each of them every hour for ten hours a day. As there are twenty-seven
  working days in the Polodan month, this plant was turning out twenty-seven
  hundred motors a month.</p>

  <p>The science of aerodynamics, whether on Earth or on Poloda, is governed by
  certain fixed natural laws; so that Polodan aircraft do not differ materially
  in appearance from those with which I was familiar on Earth, but their
  construction is radically different from ours because of their development of
  a light, practically indestructible, rigid plastic of enormous strength. Huge
  machines stamp out fuselage and wings from this plastic. The parts are then
  rigidly joined together and the seams hermetically sealed. The fuselage has a
  double wall with an air space between, and the wings are hollow.</p>

  <p>On completion of the plane the air is withdrawn from the space between the
  walls of the fuselage and from the interior of the wings, the resulting
  vacuum giving the ship considerable lifting power, which greatly increases
  the load that it can carry. They are not lighter than air, but when not
  heavily loaded they can be maneuvered and landed very slowly.</p>

  <p>There are forty of these plants, ten devoted to the manufacture of heavy
  bombers, ten to light bombers, ten to combat planes, and ten to pursuit
  planes, which are also used for reconnaissance. The enormous output of these
  factories, over a hundred thousand planes a month, is necessary to replace
  lost and worn-out planes, as well as to increase the fighting force, which is
  the aim of the Unisan government.</p>

  <p>As I had in the engine factory, I remained in this factory nine days as an
  observer, and then I was sent back to the engine factory and put to work for
  two weeks; then followed two weeks in the fuselage and assembly plants, after
  which I had three weeks of flying instruction, which on several occasions was
  interrupted by Kapar raids, resulting in dog-fights in which my instructor
  and I took part.</p>

  <p>During this period of instruction I was studying the four of the five
  principal languages of Poloda with which I was not familiar, giving special
  attention to the language of the Kapars. I also spent much time studying the
  geography of Poloda.</p>

  <p>All during this period I had no recreation whatsoever, often studying all
  night until far into the morning; so when I was finally awarded the insignia
  of a flyer, I was glad to have a day off. As I was now living in barracks, I
  had seen nothing of the Harkases; and so, on this, my first free day, I made
  a beeline for their house.</p>

  <p>Balzo Maro, the girl who had been first to discover me on my arrival on
  Poloda, was there, with Yamoda and Don. They all seemed genuinely glad to see
  me and congratulated me on my induction into the flying service.</p>

  <p>"You look very different from the first time I saw you," said Balzo Maro,
  with a smile; and I certainly did, for I was wearing the blue sequins, the
  blue boots, and the blue helmet of the fighting service.</p>

  <p>"I have learned a number of things since I came to Poloda," I told her,
  "and after having enjoyed a swimming party with a number of young men and
  women, I cannot understand why you were so shocked at my appearance that
  day."</p>

  <p>Balzo Maro laughed. "There is quite a difference between swimming and
  running around the city of Orvis that way," she said, "but really it was not
  that which shocked me. It was your brown skin and your black hair. I didn't
  know what sort of wild creature you might be."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know when I saw you running around in that fancy-dress costume
  in the middle of the day, I thought there might be something wrong with
  you."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing fancy about this," she said. "All the girls wear the
  same thing. Don't you like it&mdash;don't you think it's pretty?"</p>

  <p>"Very," I said. "But don't you tire of always wearing the same thing?
  Don't you sometimes long for a new costume."</p>

  <p>Balzo Maro shook her head. "It is war," she said: the universal answer to
  almost everything on Poloda.</p>

  <p>"We may do our hair as we please," said Harkas Yamoda, "and that is
  something."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have hairdressers who are constantly inventing new styles,"
  I said.</p>

  <p>Yamoda laughed. "Nearly a hundred years ago," she said, "the hairdressers,
  the cosmeticians, and the beauticians went into the field to work for Unis.
  What we do, we do ourselves."</p>

  <p>"You all work, don't you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Balzo Maro, "we work that we may release men for men's work in
  the fighting service and the Labour Corps."</p>

  <p>I could not but wonder what American women would do if the Nazis succeeded
  in bringing total war to their world. I think that they would arise to the
  emergency just as courageously as have the women of Unis, but it might be a
  little galling to them at first to wear the same indestructible costume from
  the time they got their growth until they were married; a costume that, like
  Balzo Maro's, as she told me, might be as much as fifty years old, and which
  had been sold and re-sold time and time again as each wearer had no further
  use for it. And then, when they were married, to wear a similar, destructible
  silver costume for the rest of their lives, or until their husbands were
  killed in battle, when they would change to purple. Doubtless, Irene, Hattie
  Carnegie, Valentina, and Adrian, would all commit suicide, along with Max
  Factor, Percy Westmore, and Elizabeth Arden. It was rather a strain on my
  imagination to visualize Elizabeth Arden hoeing potatoes.</p>

  <p>"You have been here several months now," said Harkas Don; "how do you like
  our world by this time?"</p>

  <p>"I don't have to tell you that I like the people who live in it," I
  replied. "Your courage and morale are magnificent. I like your form of
  government, too. It is simple and efficient, and seems to have developed a
  unified people without criminals or traitors."</p>

  <p>Harkas Don shook his head. "You are wrong there," he said. "We have
  criminals and we have traitors, but unquestionably far fewer than in the
  world of a hundred years ago, when there was a great deal of political
  corruption, which always goes hand in hand with crimes of other kinds. There
  are many Kapar sympathizers among us, and some full-blooded Kapars who have
  been sent here to direct espionage and sabotage. They are constantly dropping
  down by night with parachutes. We get most of them, but not all. You see,
  they are a mixed race and there are many with white skins and blond hair who
  might easily pass for Unisans."</p>

  <p>"And there are some with black hair, too," said Harkas Yamoda, as she
  looked at me meaningly, but softened it with a smile.</p>

  <p>"It's strange I was not taken for a Kapar, then, and destroyed," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"It was your dark skin that saved you," said Harkas Don, "and the fact
  that you unquestionably understood no language on Poloda. You see, they made
  some tests, of which you were not aware because you did not understand any of
  the languages. Had you, you could not have helped but show some
  reaction."</p>

  <p>Later, while we were eating the noonday meal, I remarked that for complete
  war between nations possessing possibly millions of fighting ships, the
  attacks of the Kapars since I had been in Unis had not seemed very
  severe.</p>

  <p>"We have lulls like this occasionally," said Harkas Don. "It is as though
  both sides became simultaneously tired of war, but one never can tell when it
  will break out again in all its fury."</p>

  <p>He scarcely had ceased speaking when there came a single, high-pitched
  shrieking note from the loudspeakers that are installed the length and
  breadth of the underground city. Harkas Don rose. "There it is now," he said.
  "The general alarm. You will see war now, Tangor, my friend. Come."</p>

  <p>We hurried to the car, and the girls came with us to bring the car back
  after they had delivered us to our stations.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of ramps lead to the surface from the underground airdromes of
  Orvis, and from their camouflaged openings at the surface planes zoom out and
  up at the rate of twenty a minute, one every three seconds, like winged
  termites emerging from a wooden beam.</p>

  <p>I was flying a ship in a squadron of pursuit planes. It was armed with
  four guns. One I fired through the propeller shaft, there were two in an
  after cockpit, which could be swung in any direction, and a fourth which
  fired down through the bottom of the fuselage.</p>

  <p>As I zoomed out into the open the sky was already black with our ships.
  The squadrons were forming quickly and streaking away toward the southwest,
  to meet the Kapars who would be coming in from that direction. And presently
  I saw them, like a black mass of gnats miles away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-6"
     id="chap1-6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Of course, at the time that I had been killed in our little
  war down on Earth, there had not been a great deal of aerial activity; I
  mean, no great mass flights. I know there was talk that either side might
  send over hundreds of ships in a single flight, and hundreds of ships seemed
  a lot of ships; but this day, as I followed my squadron commander into
  battle, there were more than ten thousand ships visible in the sky; and this
  was only the first wave. We were climbing steadily at terrific speed in an
  effort to get above the Kapars, and they were doing the same. We made contact
  about twelve miles above the ground, and the battle soon after developed into
  a multitude of individual dog-fights, though both sides tried to keep some
  semblance of formation.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of Poloda rises about one hundred miles above the planet,
  and one can fly up to an altitude of about fifteen miles without needing an
  oxygen tank.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes I became separated from my squadron and found myself
  engaged with three light Kapar combat planes. Ships were falling all around
  us, like dead leaves in an autumn storm; and so crowded was the sky with
  fighting ships that much of my attention had to be concentrated upon avoiding
  collisions; but I succeeded in maneuvering into a commanding position and had
  the satisfaction of seeing one of the Kapars roll over and plummet toward the
  ground. The other two were now at a disadvantage, as I was still above them
  and they turned tail and started for home. My ship was very much faster than
  one of theirs, and I soon overhauled the laggard and shot him down, too.</p>

  <p>I could not but recall my last engagement, when I shot down two of three
  Messerschmitts before being shot down myself; and I wondered if this were to
  be a repetition of that adventure&mdash;was I to die a second time?</p>

  <p>I chased the remaining Kapar out over the enormous bay that indents the
  west coast of Unis. It is called the Bay of Hagar. It is really a gulf for it
  is fully twelve hundred miles long. An enormous island at its mouth has been
  built up with the earth excavated from the underground workings of Unis,
  pumped there through a pipe that you could drive an automobile through. It
  was between the coast and this island that I got on the tail of this last
  Kapar. One gunner was hanging dead over the edge of the cockpit, but the
  other was working his gun. Above the barking of my own gun I could hear his
  bullets screaming past me; and why I wasn't hit I shall never know, unless it
  was that that Kapar was Poloda's worst marksman.</p>

  <p>Evidently I wasn't much better, but finally I saw him slump down into the
  cockpit; and then beyond his ship I saw another wave of Kapar flyers coming,
  and I felt that it was a good time to get away from there. The Kapar pilot
  that I had been pursuing must have seen the new wave at the same time that I
  did, for he turned immediately after I had turned and pursued me. And now my
  engine began to give trouble; it must have been hit by the last spurt from
  the dead gunner's piece. The Kapar was overhauling me, and he was getting in
  range, but there was no answering fire from the gunners in my after cockpit.
  I glanced back to find that they were both dead.</p>

  <p>Now I was in a fix, absolutely defenseless against the ship pulling up
  behind me. I figured I might pull a fast one on him; so I banked steeply and
  dived beneath him; then I banked again and came up under his tail with my gun
  bearing on his belly. I was firing bullets into him when he dived to escape
  me, but he never came out of that dive.</p>

  <p>To the west the sky was black with Kapar ships. In a minute they would be
  upon me; it was at that moment that my engine gave up the ghost. Ten or
  eleven miles below me was the coast of Unis. A thousand miles to the
  northeast was Orvis. I might have glided 175 or 180 miles toward the city,
  but the Kapars would long since have been over me and some of their ships
  would have been detached to come down and put an end to me. As they might
  already have sighted me, I put the ship into a spin in the hope of misleading
  them into thinking I had been shot down. I spun down for a short distance and
  then went into a straight dive, and I can tell you that spinning and diving
  for ten or eleven miles is an experience.</p>

  <p>I brought the ship down between the coast and a range of mountains, and no
  Kapar followed me. As I climbed out of the pilot's cockpit, Bantor Han, the
  third gunner, emerged from the ship.</p>

  <p>"Nice work," he said, "we got all three of them."</p>

  <p>"We had a bit of luck," I said, "and now we've got a long walk to
  Orvis."</p>

  <p>"We'll never see Orvis again," said the gunner.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"This coast has been right in the path of Kapar flights for a hundred
  years. Where we are standing was once one of the largest cities of Unis, a
  great seaport. Can you find a stick or stone of it now? And for two or three
  hundred miles inland it is the same; nothing but bomb craters."</p>

  <p>"But are there no cities in this part of Unis?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There are some farther south. The nearest is about a thousand miles from
  here, and on the other side of this range of mountains. There are cities far
  to the north, and cities east of Orvis; but it has never been practical to
  build even underground cities directly in the path of the Kapar flights,
  while there are other sections less affected."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I am not going to give up so easily. I will at least try
  to get to Orvis or some other city. Suppose we try for the one on the other
  side of these mountains. At least we won't be in the path of the Kapars every
  time they come over."</p>

  <p>Bantor Han shook his head again. "Those mountains are full of wild
  beasts," he said. "There was a very large collection of wild animals in the
  city of Hagar when the war broke out over a hundred years ago. Many of them
  were killed in the first bombing of the city; but all their barriers were
  broken down, and the survivors escaped. For a hundred years they have ranged
  these mountains and they have multiplied. The inhabitants of Polan, this city
  you wish to try to reach, scarcely dare stick their heads above-ground
  because of them. No," he continued, "we have no complaint to make. You and I
  will die here, and that will mean that we have lost four men and one pursuit
  plane to their three light combat ships and, possibly, twenty men. It is a
  mighty good day's work, Tangor, and you should be proud."</p>

  <p>"That is what I call patriotism and loyalty," I said; "but I can be just
  as patriotic and loyal alive as dead, and I don't intend even to think of
  giving up yet. If we are going to die anyway, I can see no advantage in
  sitting here and starving to death."</p>

  <p>Bantor Han shrugged. "That suits me," he said. "I thought I was as good as
  dead when you tackled those three combat planes, and the chances are that I
  should have been killed in my next engagement. I have been too lucky; so, if
  you prefer to go and look for death instead of waiting for it to come to you,
  I'll trot along with you."</p>

  <p>So Bantor Han and I took the weapons and ammunition of our dead comrades
  and entered the Mountains of Loras.</p>

  <p>I was amazed by the beauty of these mountains after we entered them. We
  were about eight or nine hundred miles north of the Equator and the climate
  was similar to the south temperate zone of Earth in summertime. Everything
  was green and beautiful, with a profusion of the strange trees and plants and
  flowers which are so like those of Earth, and yet so unlike. I had been
  cooped up for so long in the underground city of Orvis that I felt like a boy
  just released from a schoolroom for a long vacation. But Bantor Han was
  uneasy. "Of course, I was born here in Unis," he said, "but being on the
  surface like this is to me like being in a strange world, for I have spent
  practically all of my life either underground or high up in the air."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that this is beautiful?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I suppose it is, but it is a little bewildering; there is
  so much of it. There is a feeling of rest, and quiet, and security down there
  in underground Orvis; and I am always glad to get back to it after a
  flight."</p>

  <p>I suppose that was the result of living underground for generations, and
  that Bantor Han had developed a complex the exact opposite of claustrophobia.
  Possibly it has a name, but if it has I never heard it. There were streams in
  the mountains, and little lakes where we saw fish playing, and the first
  animal that we saw appeared to be some sort of an antelope. It was armed with
  long, sharp horns, and looked something like an addax. It was standing with
  its forefeet in shallow water at the edge of a lake, drinking, when we came
  upon it; and as it was upwind from us it did not catch our scent. When I saw
  it I drew Bantor Han into the concealment of some bushes.</p>

  <p>"There is food," I whispered, and Bantor Han nodded.</p>

  <p>I took careful aim and brought the animal down with a single bullet
  through the heart. We were busy carving a few steaks from it when our
  attention was attracted by a most unpleasant growl. We looked up
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"That's what I meant," said Bantor Han. "The mountains are full of
  creatures like that."</p>

  <p>Like most of the animals that I have seen on Poloda, it did not differ
  greatly from those on Earth; that is, they all have four legs, and two eyes,
  and usually a tail. Some are covered with hair, some with wool, some with
  fur, and some are hairless. The Polodan horse has three-toed feet, and a
  little horn in the center of his forehead. The cattle have no horns, nor are
  their hoofs cloven, and in fighting they bite and kick like an earthly horse.
  They are not horses and cows at all, but I call them by earthly names because
  of the purposes for which they are used. The horses are the saddle animals
  and beasts of burden, and occasionally are used for food. The cattle are
  definitely beef animals, and the cows give milk. The creature that was
  creeping toward us with menacing growls was built like a lion and striped
  like a zebra, and it was about the size of an African lion. I drew my pistol
  from its holster, but Bantor Han laid a hand upon my arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot it," he said, "you may make it angry. If we go away and leave
  this meat to it, it probably will not attack us."</p>

  <p>"If you think I am going to leave our supper to that thing, you are very
  much mistaken," I said. I was amazed at Bantor Han! I knew that he was no
  coward. He had an excellent record in the fighting service and was covered
  with decorations. But everything here on the ground was so new and strange to
  him. Put him twelve miles up in the air, or a hundred feet underground, and
  he wouldn't have backed down for man or beast.</p>

  <p>I shook his hand off and took careful aim just as the creature charged,
  with a charge for all the world like an African lion. I let him have it
  straight in the heart&mdash;a stream of four or five bullets, and they almost
  tore him apart, for they were explosive bullets.</p>

  <p>Civilized, cultured, as these Unisans are, they use both dumdum and
  exploding projectiles in their small arms. When I commented on the fact to
  one of them, he replied: "This is the complete war that the Kapars asked
  for."</p>

  <p>"Well," exclaimed Bantor Han, "you did it, didn't you?" He seemed
  surprised that I had killed the beast.</p>

  <p>We cooked and ate the antelope steaks, and left the rest where it lay, for
  we had no means of carrying any of it with us. We felt much refreshed, and I
  think that Bantor Han felt a little safer now that he had found that we were
  not going to be eaten up by the first carnivorous animal that we met.</p>

  <p>It took us two days to cross through this mountain range. Fortunately for
  us, we had tackled it near its extreme northern end, where it was quite
  narrow and the mountains were little more than large hills. We had plenty to
  eat, and were only attacked twice more by dangerous animals, once by a huge
  creature that resembled a hyena, and again by the beast that I have named
  "the lion of Poloda." The two nights were the worst, because of the increased
  danger of prowling carnivora. The first we spent in a cave, and took turns
  standing watch, and the second night we slept in the open; but luck was with
  us and nothing attacked us.</p>

  <p>As we came down out of a caon on the east side of the mountains we saw
  that which brought us to a sudden stop&mdash;a Kapar plane not half a mile
  from us, on the edge of a little ravine that was a continuation of the caon
  we were in. There were two men beside the plane, and they seemed to be
  digging in the ground.</p>

  <p>"Two more Kapars for our bag, Bantor Han," I said.</p>

  <p>"If we get them and destroy their plane, we can certainly afford to die,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"You're always wanting to die," I said reproachfully. "I intend to live."
  He would have been surprised had he known I was already dead, and buried
  somewhere 548,000 light-years away! "And furthermore, Bantor Han," I added,
  "we are not going to destroy that plane; not if it will fly."</p>

  <p>We dropped into the ravine and made our way down toward the Kapars. We
  were entirely concealed from above, and if we made any noise it was drowned
  out by the noise of the little brook running over its rocky bed.</p>

  <p>When I thought we had gone far enough, I told Bantor Han to wait and then
  I clambered up the side of the ravine to reconnoiter. Sure enough, I had hit
  the nail right on the head. There were the two Kapars digging away, scarcely
  a hundred feet from me. I crouched down and beckoned Bantor Han to come
  up.</p>

  <p>There is no chivalry in complete war, I can assure you. Those two Kapars
  didn't have a chance. They were both dead before they knew there was an enemy
  within a thousand miles. Then we went to see what they had been at, and found
  a box beside the hole which they had been excavating. It was a metal box with
  a waterproof top, and when we opened it we found that it contained two
  complete blue uniforms of the Unis Fighting Corps, together with helmets,
  boots, ammunition belts, daggers, and guns. There were also directions in the
  Kapar language for entering the city of Orvis and starting numerous fires on
  a certain night about a month later. Even the location of the buildings that
  might most easily be fired, and from which the fires would spread most
  rapidly, was given.</p>

  <p>We put the box aboard the ship and climbed in.</p>

  <p>"We'll never make it," said Bantor Han. "We're bound to be shot down."</p>

  <p>"You're certainly determined to die, aren't you?" I said, as I started the
  engine and taxied for the takeoff.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-7"
     id="chap1-7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I knew that the sound-detectors were already giving warning
  of the approach of a ship, and of a Kapar ship, too; for our ships are
  equipped with a secret device which permits the detectors to recognize them.
  The signal that it gives can be changed at will, and is changed every day, so
  that it really amounts to a countersign. Watchers must be on the alert for
  even a single ship, but I was positive that they would be looking up in the
  air; so I hugged the ground, flying at an elevation of little more than
  twenty feet.</p>

  <p>Before we reached the mountains which surround Orvis, I saw a squadron of
  pursuit planes come over the summit.</p>

  <p>"They are looking for us," I said to Bantor Han, who was in the after
  cockpit, "and I'm going right up where they can see us."</p>

  <p>"You'll come down in a hurry," said Bantor Han.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen," I said; "as soon as we get where you can distinguish the
  gunners and pilots and see that their uniforms are blue, you stand up and
  wave something, for if you can see the color of their uniforms, they can see
  the color of yours; and I don't believe they will shoot us down then."</p>

  <p>"That's where you're mistaken," said Bantor Han; "lots of Kapars have
  tried to enter Orvis in uniforms taken from our dead pilots."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget to stand up and wave," I said.</p>

  <p>We were getting close now, and it was a tense moment. I could plainly see
  the blue uniforms of the gunners and the pilots; and they could certainly see
  Bantor Han's and mine, and with Bantor Han waving to them they must realize
  that here was something unusual.</p>

  <p>Presently the Squadron Commander ordered his ships to take position above
  us; and then he commenced to circle us, coming closer and closer. He came so
  close at last that our wings almost touched.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Bantor Han and Tangor," I replied, "in a captured Kapar ship."</p>

  <p>I heard one of his gunners say: "Yes, that's Bantor Han. I know him
  well."</p>

  <p>"Land just south of the city," said the Squadron Commander. "We'll escort
  you down; otherwise you'll be shot down."</p>

  <p>I signalled that I understood, and he said, "Follow me."</p>

  <p>So we dropped down toward Orvis near the apex of a V-formation, and I can
  tell you I was mighty glad to pile out of that ship with a whole skin.</p>

  <p>I told the Squadron Commander about what we had seen the two Kapars doing,
  and turned the box over to him. Then I went and reported to my own Squadron
  Commander.</p>

  <p>"I never expected to see you again," he said. "What luck did you
  have?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two Kapars and four ships," I replied.</p>

  <p>He looked at me a bit skeptically. "All by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"There were three in my crew," I said. "I lost two of them, and my
  ship."</p>

  <p>"The balance is still very much in your favor," he said. "Who else
  survived?"</p>

  <p>"Bantor Han," I replied.</p>

  <p>"A good man," he said. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Waiting outside, sir."</p>

  <p>He summoned Bantor Han. "I understand you had very good luck," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Yes sir," said Bantor Han; "four ships and twenty-two men, though we lost
  two men and our ship."</p>

  <p>"I shall recommend decorations for both of you," he said, and dismissed
  us. "You may take a day off," he said, "you have earned it; and you, too,
  Bantor Han."</p>

  <p>I lost no time in setting off to the Harkases. Harkas Yamoda was in the
  garden, sitting staring at the ground and looking very sad; but when I spoke
  her name she leaped to her feet and came running toward me, laughing almost
  hysterically. She seized me by both arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tangor," she cried, "you did not come back, and we were sure that you
  had been shot down. The last that anyone saw of you, you were fighting three
  Kapar combat planes alone."</p>

  <p>"Harkas Don," I asked, "&mdash;he came back?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; now we shall all be so thankful and so happy&mdash;until next
  time."</p>

  <p>I had dinner with Yamoda and her father and mother, and after dinner
  Harkas Don came. He was as surprised and delighted as the others to see
  me.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you had a chance," he said. "When a man is gone three
  days, he is reported dead. You were very fortunate."</p>

  <p>"How did the battle go, Harkas Don?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"We thrashed them as usual," he said. "We have better ships, better
  pilots, better gunners, better guns, and I think that now we have more ships.
  I don't know why they keep on coming over. They sent over two waves of five
  thousand ships each this time, and we shot down at least five thousand of
  them. We lost a thousand ships and two thousand men. The others parachuted to
  safety."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why they keep it up," I said. "I shouldn't think they'd be
  able to get men to fight when they know they are just going to their death
  for no good reason."</p>

  <p>"They are afraid of their masters," replied Harkas Don, "and they have
  been regimented for so many years that they have no initiative and no
  individuality. Another reason is that they wish to eat. The leaders live like
  princes of old; the army officers live exceptionally well; and the soldiers
  get plenty to eat, such as it is. If they were not fighting men, they would
  be laborers, which, in Kapara, is the equivalent of being a slave. They get
  barely enough food to subsist upon and they work from sixteen to eighteen
  hours a day; yet their lot is infinitely better than that of the subjugated
  peoples, many of whom have been reduced to cannibalism."</p>

  <p>"Let's talk of something pleasant," said Yamoda.</p>

  <p>"I think I see something pleasant to talk about, coming," I said, nodding
  toward the entrance to the garden where we were sitting. It was Balzo
  Maro.</p>

  <p>She came in with a brilliant smile, which I could see was forced. Harkas
  Don met her and took both her hands and pressed them, and Yamoda kissed her.
  I had never seen such demonstrations of affection before, for though those
  three people loved one another, and each knew it, they made no show of that
  love in front of others.</p>

  <p>They evidently saw that I was puzzled, and Balzo Maro said, "My youngest
  brother died gloriously in the battle;" and after a pause she said: "It is
  war." I am not terribly emotional, but a lump came in my throat and tears to
  my eyes. These brave people! How they have suffered because of the greed for
  power, the vanity, and the hate of a man who died almost a hundred years
  ago!</p>

  <p>They did not speak of Balzo Maro's loss again; they never would speak of
  it again. It is war.</p>

  <p>"So you have tomorrow free," said Harkas Don. "Perhaps you are
  fortunate."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow we raid Kapara with twenty thousand ships," he said. "It is a
  reprisal raid."</p>

  <p>"And then they will send over forty thousand ships in reprisal," said
  Harkas Yamoda; "and so it goes on forever."</p>

  <p>"I shall not have a free day tomorrow," I said.</p>

  <p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked Yamoda.</p>

  <p>"I am going out with my squadron," I said. "I don't see why the commander
  didn't tell me."</p>

  <p>"Because you have earned a day to yourself," said Harkas Don.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I am going," I said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-8"
     id="chap1-8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We took off the next morning just before dawn, thousands of
  planes of all descriptions. We were to fly at an altitude of twelve miles,
  and as we gained it, four of Omos' eleven planets were visible in the
  heavens, the nearest less than six hundred thousand miles away. It was a
  gorgeous sight indeed. Around Omos, the sun of this system, revolve eleven
  planets, each approximately the size of our Earth. They are spaced almost
  exactly equidistant from one another; the path of their orbits being a
  million miles from the center of the sun, which is much smaller than the sun
  of our own solar system. An atmospheric belt seventy-two hundred miles in
  diameter revolves with the planets in the same orbit, thus connecting the
  planets by an air lane which offers the suggestion of possible
  inter-planetary travel; this Harkas Yen told me might have been achieved long
  since had it not been for the war.</p>

  <p>Ever since I came to Poloda my imagination has been intrigued by thoughts
  of the possibilities inherent in a visit to these other planets, where
  conditions almost identical with those on Poloda must exist. On these other
  planets there may be, and probably are, animal and plant life not dissimilar
  from our own, but which there is little likelihood that we shall ever see
  while complete war is maintained upon Poloda.</p>

  <p>I had a long flight ahead of me, and speculating on inter-planetary travel
  helped to pass the time away. Kapara lies on the continent of Epris, and
  Ergos, the capital of Kapara, is some eleven thousand miles from Orvis; and
  as our slowest planes have a speed of five hundred miles an hour, we were due
  over Ergos a couple of hours before dawn of the following day. As all three
  of my gunners are relief pilots, we relieved each other every four hours.
  Bantor Han was not with me on this flight, and I had three men with whom I
  had not previously flown. However, like all of the men of the fighting forces
  of Unis, they were efficient and dependable.</p>

  <p>After crossing the coastline of Unis we flew three thousand and five
  hundred miles over the great Karagan Ocean, which extends for eighty-five
  hundred miles from the northern continent of Karis to the southernmost tip of
  Unis, where the continents of Epris and Unis almost meet.</p>

  <p>At an altitude of twelve miles there is not much to see but atmosphere.
  Occasional cloud banks floated beneath us, and between them we could see the
  blue ocean, scintillating in the sunlight, looking almost as smooth as a
  millpond; but the scintillation told us that high seas were running.</p>

  <p>About noon we sighted the shore of Epris; and shortly after, a wave of
  Kapar planes came to meet us. There were not more than a thousand of them in
  this wave; and we drove them back, destroying about half of them, before a
  second and much larger wave attacked us. The fighting was furious, but most
  of our bombers got through. Our squadron was escorting one of the heavy
  bombers, and we were constantly engaged in fighting off enemy attack planes.
  My plane was engaged in three dog-fights within half an hour, and I was
  fortunate to come through with the loss of only one man, one of the gunners
  in the after cockpit. After each fight I had to open her up wide and overtake
  the bomber and her convoy.</p>

  <p>The cruising speed of these pursuit ships is around five hundred miles an
  hour, but they have a top speed of almost six hundred miles. The bombers
  cruise at about five hundred, with a top speed around five hundred and
  fifty.</p>

  <p>Of the two thousand light and heavy bombers that started out with the
  fleet on this raid, about eighteen hundred got through to Ergos; and there,
  believe me, the real fighting commenced. Thousands upon thousands of Kapar
  planes soared into the air, and our fleet was augmented by the arrival of the
  survivors of the dog-fights.</p>

  <p>As the bombers unloaded their heavy bombs we could first see the flames of
  the explosions and then, after what seemed a long while, the sound of the
  detonation would come to us from twelve miles below. Ships were falling all
  about us, ours and the Kapars. Bullets screamed about us, and it was during
  this phase of the engagement that I lost my remaining after cockpit
  gunner.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Kapar fleet disappeared, and then the anti-aircraft guns
  opened up on us. Like the anti-aircraft guns of Unis, they fire a
  thousand-pound shell twelve or fifteen miles up into the air, and the burst
  scatters fragments of steel for five hundred yards in all directions. Other
  shells contain wire nets and small parachutes, which support the nets in the
  air to entangle and foul propellers.</p>

  <p>After unloading our bombs, some seven or eight thousand tons of them, upon
  an area of two hundred square miles over and around Ergos, we started for
  home, circling to the east and then to the north, which would bring us in
  over the southernmost tip of Unis. I had two dead men in the after cockpit;
  and I hadn't been able to raise the gunner in the belly of the ship for some
  time.</p>

  <p>As we circled over the eastern tip of Epris, my motor failed entirely, and
  there was nothing for me to do but come down. Another hour and I would have
  been within gliding distance of the tip of Unis, or one of the three islands
  which are an extension of this tip, at the southern end of the Karagan
  Ocean.</p>

  <p>The crews of many ships saw me gliding down for a landing, but no ship
  followed to succor me. It is one of the rules of the service that other ships
  and men must not be jeopardized to assist a pilot who is forced down in enemy
  country. The poor devil is just written off as a loss. I knew from my study
  of Polodan geography that I was beyond the southeastern boundary of Kapara,
  and over the country formerly known as Punos, one of the first to be
  subjugated by the Kapars over a hundred years before.</p>

  <p>What the country was like I could only guess from rumors that are current
  in Unis, and which suggest that its people have been reduced to the status of
  wild beasts by years of persecution and starvation.</p>

  <p>As I approached the ground I saw a mountainous country beneath me and two
  rivers which joined to form a very large river that emptied into a bay on the
  southern shoreline; but I found no people, no cities, and no indication of
  cultivated fields. Except along the river courses, where vegetation was
  discernible, the land appeared to be a vast wilderness. The whole terrain
  below me appeared pitted with ancient shell-craters, attesting the terrific
  bombardment to which it had been subjected in a bygone day.</p>

  <p>I had about given up all hope of finding a level place on which to make a
  landing, when I discovered one in the mouth of a broad caon, at the southern
  foot of a range of mountains.</p>

  <p>As I was about to set the ship down I saw figures moving a short distance
  up the caon. At first I could not make out what they were, for they dodged
  behind trees in an evident effort to conceal themselves from me; but when the
  ship came to rest they came out, a dozen men armed with spears and bows and
  arrows. They wore loincloths made of the skin of some animal, and they
  carried long knives in their belts. Their hair was matted and their bodies
  were filthy and terribly emaciated.</p>

  <p>They crept toward me, taking advantage of whatever cover the terrain
  afforded; and as they came they fitted arrows to their bows.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-9"
     id="chap1-9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The attitude of the reception committee was not encouraging.
  It seemed to indicate that I was not a welcome guest. I knew that if I let
  them get within bow range, a flight of arrows was almost certain to get me;
  so the thing to do was keep them out of bow range. I stood up in the cockpit
  and levelled my pistol at them, and they immediately disappeared behind rocks
  and trees.</p>

  <p>I wished very much to examine my engine and determine if it were possible
  for me to repair it, but I realized that as long as these men of Punos were
  around that would be impossible. I might go after them; but they had the
  advantage of cover and of knowing the terrain; and while I might get some of
  them, I could not get them all; and those that I did not get would come back,
  and they could certainly hang around until after dark and then rush me.</p>

  <p>It looked as though I were in a pretty bad way, but I finally decided to
  get down and go after them and have it out. Just then one of them stuck his
  head up above a rock and called to me. He spoke in one of the five languages
  of Unis that I had learned.</p>

  <p>"Are you a Unisan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Then do not shoot," he said. "We will not harm you."</p>

  <p>"If that is true," I said, "go away."</p>

  <p>"We want to talk to you," he said. "We want to know how the war is going
  and when it will end."</p>

  <p>"One of you may come down," I said, "but not more."</p>

  <p>"I will come," he said, "but you need not fear us."</p>

  <p>He came down toward me then, an old man with wrinkled skin and a huge
  abdomen, which his skinny legs seemed scarcely able to support. His grey hair
  was matted with twigs and dirt, and he had the few grey hairs about his chin
  which can note old age on Poloda.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were from Unis when I saw your blue uniform," he said. "In
  olden times the people of Unis and the people of Punos were good friends.
  That has been handed down from father to son for many generations. When the
  Kapars first attacked us, the men of Unis gave us aid; but they, too, were
  unprepared; and before they had the strength to help us we were entirely
  subjugated, and all of Punos was overrun with Kapars. They flew their ships
  from our coastlines, and they set up great guns there; but after a while the
  men of Unis built great fleets and drove them out. Then, however, it was too
  late for our people."</p>

  <p>"How do you live?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is hard," he said. "The Kapars still come over occasionally, and if
  they find a cultivated field they bomb and destroy it. They fly low and shoot
  any people they see, which makes it difficult to raise crops in open country;
  so we have been driven into the mountains, where we live on fish and roots
  and whatever else we can find."</p>

  <p>"Many years ago," he continued, "the Kapars kept an army stationed here,
  and before they were through they killed every living thing that they could
  find&mdash;animals, birds, men, women, and children. Only a few hundred
  Punosans hid themselves in the inaccessible fastnesses of this mountain
  range, and in the years that have passed we have killed off all the remaining
  game for food faster than it could propagate."</p>

  <p>"You have no meat at all?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Only when a Kapar is forced down near us," he replied. "We hoped that you
  were a Kapar, but because you are a Unisan you are safe."</p>

  <p>"But now that you are so helpless, why is it that the Kapars will not
  permit you to raise crops for food?"</p>

  <p>"Because our ancestors resisted them when they invaded our country and
  that aroused the hatred upon which Kapars live. Because of this hatred they
  tried to exterminate us. Now they fear to let us get a start again, and if we
  were left alone there would be many of us in another hundred years; and once
  again we would constitute a menace to Kapara."</p>

  <p>Harkas Yen had told me about Punos and I had also read something about the
  country in the history of Poloda. It had been inhabited by a virile and
  intelligent race of considerable culture. Its ships sailed the four great
  oceans of Poloda, carrying on commerce with the people of all the five
  continents. The central portion was a garden spot, supporting countless
  farms, where grazed countless herds of livestock; and along its coastline
  were its manufacturing cities and its fisheries. I looked at the poor old
  devil standing before me: this was what the warped, neurotic mind of one man
  could do to a happy and prosperous nation!</p>

  <p>"Won't your ship fly?" he asked me.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I said. "I want to examine the motor and find out."</p>

  <p>"You'd better let us push it into the caon for you," he said. "It can be
  better hidden there from any Kapars who may fly over."</p>

  <p>There was something about the poor old fellow that gave me confidence in
  him, and as the suggestion was a wise one, I accepted it. So he called his
  companions and they came down out of the caon&mdash;eleven dirty, scrawny,
  hopeless-looking creatures of all ages. They tried to smile at me, but I
  guess the smiling muscles of their ancestors had commenced to atrophy
  generations before.</p>

  <p>They helped me push the ship into the caon, where, beneath a large tree,
  it was pretty well hidden from above. I had forgotten the dead men aboard the
  ship; but one of the Punosans, climbing up on the wing, discovered the two in
  the after cockpit; and I knew that there must be another one in the belly of
  the ship. I shuddered as I thought what was passing through the creature's
  mind.</p>

  <p>"There are dead men in the ship," he said to his fellows; and the old man,
  who was the leader, climbed up on the wing and looked; then he turned to
  me.</p>

  <p>"Shall we bury your friends for you?" he asked, and a weight of fear and
  sorrow was lifted from my shoulders.</p>

  <p>They helped me remove the cartridge belts and uniforms from the bodies of
  my friends and then they scooped out shallow graves with their knives and
  their hands, and laid the three bodies in them and covered them again.</p>

  <p>When these sad and simple rites were ended, I started taking my engine
  down, the twelve Punosans hanging around and watching everything I did. They
  asked many questions about the progress of the war, but I could not encourage
  them to think that it would soon be over, or ever.</p>

  <p>I found the damage that had been done to my engine, and I knew that I
  could make the necessary repairs, for we carried tools and spare parts; but
  it was getting late and I could not complete the repairs until the following
  day.</p>

  <p>The old man realized this and asked me if I would come to their village
  and spend the night there.</p>

  <p>I could have slept in the ship, but purely out of curiosity I decided to
  accept his invitation.</p>

  <p>Before we started for his village he touched me timidly on the arm. "May
  we have the guns and ammunition of your dead friends?" he asked. "If we had
  them, we might kill some more Kapars."</p>

  <p>"Do you know how to use them?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "we have found them on the bodies of Kapars who crashed
  here, and those whom we killed, but we have used up all the ammunition."</p>

  <p>I followed them up the caon and then along a narrow, precipitous trail
  that led to a tiny mesa on the shoulder of a towering peak. A waterfall
  tumbled from the cliff above into a little lake at its foot, and from there a
  mountain stream wandered across the mesa to leap over the edge of another
  cliff a mile away. Trees grew along one side of the stream and up to the foot
  of the cliff, and among these trees the village was hidden from the eyes of
  roving pilots.</p>

  <p>Hide! Hide! Hide! A world in hiding! It seemed difficult to imagine that
  anyone had ever walked freely in the sunlight on the surface of Poloda
  without being ready to dodge beneath a tree, or into a hole in the ground;
  and I wondered if my world would ever come to that. It didn't seem possible;
  but for thousands of years, up until a hundred years ago, no inhabitant of
  Poloda would have thought it possible here.</p>

  <p>In the village were a hundred people, forty women, fifty men, and ten
  children, poor, scrawny little things, with spindly arms and legs and
  enormous bellies, the result of stuffing, themselves with grasses and twigs
  and leaves to assuage the pangs of hunger. When the villagers saw my escort
  coming in with me they ran forward hungrily, but when they recognized my blue
  uniform they stopped.</p>

  <p>"He is our friend and guest," said the chief. "He has killed many Kapars,
  and he has given us guns and ammunition to kill more." And he showed them the
  weapons and the ammunition belts.</p>

  <p>They crowded around me then and, like the twelve men, asked innumerable
  questions. They dwelt much upon the food we had in Unis, and were surprised
  to know that we had plenty to eat, for they thought that the Kapars must have
  devastated Unis as they had Punos.</p>

  <p>The little children came timidly and felt of me. To them I was a man from
  another world. To me they were the indictment of a hideous regime.</p>

  <p>The hunting party whose activities I had interrupted had brought in a
  couple of small rodents and a little bird. The women built a fire and put a
  large pot on it, in which there was a little water. Then they took the
  feathers off the bird and skinned the rodents, and threw them in without
  cleaning them. To this they added herbs and roots and handfuls of grass.</p>

  <p>"The skins will make a little soup for the children for breakfast," an old
  woman explained to me as she laid them carefully aside.</p>

  <p>They stirred the horrible mess with a piece of a small branch of a tree,
  and when it boiled the children clustered around to sniff the steam as it
  arose; and the adults formed a circle and stared at the pot hungrily.</p>

  <p>I had never seen starving people before, and I prayed to God that I might
  never see any again unless I had the means wherewith to fill their bellies;
  and as I watched them I did not wonder that they ate Kapars, and I marvelled
  at the kindliness and strength of will that kept them from eating me. When
  those mothers looked at me I could imagine that they were thinking of me in
  terms of steaks and chops which they must forego although their children were
  starving.</p>

  <p>In a community in which there were forty adult women there were only ten
  children, but I wondered how there could be any, infant mortality must
  certainly be high among a starving people. I could imagine that I was looking
  at the remnant of a race that would soon be extinct, and I thought that there
  must be something wrong with all the religions in the universe that such a
  thing could happen to these people while the Kapars lived and bred.</p>

  <p>When they thought the mess in the pot was sufficiently cooked, little cups
  of clay, crudely burnt, were passed out, and the chief carefully measured out
  the contents of the pot with a large wooden ladle. When he came to me, I
  shook my head; and he looked offended.</p>

  <p>"Is our fare too mean for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not that," I said. "I am well fed, and tomorrow I shall eat again.
  Here are starving men, and starving women, and, above all, starving
  children."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he said. "You are a very kind man. The children shall have
  your share." Then he dipped out other cupful and divided it among the ten
  children, scarcely a mouthful apiece; but they were so grateful that once
  again the tears came to my eyes. I must be getting to be a regular softy; but
  before I came to Poloda I had never seen such sadness, such courage, such
  fortitude, or such suffering, as I have upon this poor war-torn planet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-10"
     id="chap1-10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Next morning the whole village accompanied me down the
  canyon to see me take off for Orvis. Three men went far in advance and when
  we got down into the canyon one of them came running back to meet us. I could
  see that he was very much excited, and he was motioning to us to be
  silent.</p>

  <p>"There is a Kapar at your ship," he said, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Let me go ahead," I said to the chief. "There will probably be
  shooting."</p>

  <p>"We should have brought the guns," he said. "Why did I not think of that?"
  And he sent three men scurrying back to get them.</p>

  <p>I walked down the caon until I came to the other two men who had gone
  ahead. They were hiding behind bushes and they motioned me to take cover, but
  I had no time for that; and instead I ran forward, and when I came in sight
  of the ship a man was just climbing up onto the wing. He was a Kapar all
  right, and I started firing as I ran toward him. I missed him, and he wheeled
  about and held both hands above his head in sign of surrender.</p>

  <p>I kept him covered as I walked toward him, but as I got nearer I saw that
  he was unarmed.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing there, Kapar?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>He came toward me, his hands still above his head. "For the honor and
  glory of Unis," he said. "I am no Kapar." He removed his grey helmet,
  revealing a head of blond hair. But I had been told that there were some
  blond Kapars, and I was not to be taken in by any ruse.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to do better than that," I said. "If you are a Unisan, you
  can prove it more convincingly than by showing a head of blond hair. Who are
  you, and from what city do you come?"</p>

  <p>"I am Balzo Jan," he said, "and I come from the city of Orvis."</p>

  <p>Now Balzo Jan was the brother that Balzo Maro had said was shot down in
  battle. This might be he, but I was still unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"I was shot down in battle about two hundred miles from here," he said.
  "We made a good landing and some Kapars who saw that we were evidently not
  killed came down to finish us off. There were four of them and three of us.
  We got all four of them, but not before my two companions were killed.
  Knowing that I was somewhere in Epris, and therefore in Kapar-dominated
  country, I took the uniform of one of the Kapars as a disguise."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you take his gun and ammunition, too?"</p>

  <p>"Because we had all exhausted all our ammunition," he replied, "and guns
  without ammunition are only an extra burden to carry. I had killed the last
  Kapar with my last bullet."</p>

  <p>"You may be all right," I said, "but I don't know. Can you tell me the
  name of some of your sister's friends?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "Her best friends are Harkas Yamoda and Harkas Don,
  daughter and son of Harkas Yen."</p>

  <p>"I guess you're all right," I said. "There are a couple of blue uniforms
  in the after cockpit. Get into one of them at once, and then we'll go to work
  on the motor."</p>

  <p>"Look," he cried, pointing beyond me, "some men are coming. They are going
  to attack us."</p>

  <p>I turned to see my friendly hosts creeping toward us with shafts fitted to
  their bows.</p>

  <p>"It is all right," I shouted to them, "this is a friend."</p>

  <p>"If he is a friend of yours, then you must be a Kapar," replied the
  chief.</p>

  <p>"He is no Kapar," I insisted; and then I turned and shouted to Balzo Jan
  to get into a blue uniform at once.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have deceived us," shouted the chief. "How do we know that
  you are not a Kapar, after all?"</p>

  <p>"Our children are hungry," screamed a woman farther back up the caon.
  "Our children are hungry, we are hungry, and here are two Kapars."</p>

  <p>It was commencing to look very serious. The men were creeping closer; they
  would soon be within bow range. I had put my pistol back into its holster
  after I had been convinced that Balzo Jan was no impostor, and I did not draw
  it as I walked forward to meet the chief.</p>

  <p>"We are friends," I said. "You see, I am not afraid of you. Would I have
  given you the three guns and the ammunition had I been a Kapar? Would I have
  let that man back there live if I had not known that he was a Unisan?"</p>

  <p>The chief shook his head. "That is right," he said. "You would not have
  given us the guns and ammunition had you been a Kapar. But how do you know
  this man is not a Kapar?" he added suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Because he is the brother of a friend of mine," I explained. "He was shot
  down behind the Kapar lines and he took the uniform from a Kapar he had
  killed to use as a disguise, because he knew that he was in Kapar
  country."</p>

  <p>About this time Balzo Jan crawled out of the after cockpit dressed in the
  blue suit, boots, and helmet of a Unisan fighting man.</p>

  <p>"Does he look like a Kapar?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," the chief said. "You must forgive us. My people hate the Kapars, and
  they are hungry."</p>

  <p>With Balzo Jan's help I had the engine repaired and we were ready to take
  off a little after noon; and when we rose into the air the starving villagers
  stood sad-eyed and mute, watching us fly away toward a land of plenty.</p>

  <p>As we rose above the mountains that lay between us and the coast I saw
  three ships far to our left. They were flying in a south-westerly direction
  towards Kapara.</p>

  <p>"I think they are Kapars," said Balzo Jan, who was far more familiar with
  the lines of Polodan ships than I, having spent most of his lifetime looking
  at them.</p>

  <p>Even as we watched, the three ships turned in our direction. Whatever they
  were, they had sighted us and were coming for us.</p>

  <p>If they were Unisans, we had nothing to fear; nor for that matter did we
  have anything to fear if they were Kapars, for my ship could out fly them by
  a hundred miles an hour. Had they been as fast as ours, they could have cut
  us off, for they were in the right position to do so. We had been making
  about four hundred miles an hour and now I opened the throttle wide, for I
  did not purpose taking any chances, as I felt that we wouldn't have a chance
  against three Kapars, with three or four guns apiece, while we only had two.
  I opened the throttle, but nothing happened. The engine didn't accelerate at
  all. I told Balzo Jan.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to fight, then," he said, "and I wanted to get home and get
  a decent meal. I have had practically nothing to eat for three days."</p>

  <p>I knew how Balzo Jan felt, for I had had nothing to eat myself for some
  time, and anyway I had had enough fighting for a while.</p>

  <p>"They are Kapars all right," said Balzo Jan presently.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about that now; the black of their wings and fuselages
  was quite apparent, and we were just about going to meet them over the island
  off the southern tip of Unis. We were going to meet right over the last and
  largest of the three islands, which is called the Island of Despair, where
  are sent those confirmed criminals who are not to be destroyed, and those
  Unisans whose loyalty is suspected, but who cannot be convicted of
  treason.</p>

  <p>I had been fiddling with the engine controls, trying to step up the speed
  a little, when the first burst of fire whistled about us. The leading ship
  was coming head-on toward us, firing only from her forward gun, when Balzo
  Jan sent a stream of explosive projectiles into her. I saw her propeller
  disappear then, and she started to glide toward the Island of Despair.</p>

  <p>"That's the end of them," shouted Balzo Han.</p>

  <p>Quite suddenly and unexpectedly my motor took hold again, and we
  immediately drew away from the other two ships, which Balzo Jan was spraying
  with gunfire.</p>

  <p>We must have been hit fifty times, but the plastic of our fuselage and
  wings could withstand machine-gun fire, which could injure us only by a lucky
  hit of propeller or instrument-board. It is the heavier guns of combat planes
  and bombers that these fast, lightly armed pursuit planes have to fear.</p>

  <p>"I hate to run from Kapars," I shouted back to Balzo Jan. "Shall we stay
  and have it out with them?"</p>

  <p>"We have no right to throw away a ship and two men," he said, "in a
  hopeless fight."</p>

  <p>Well, that was that. Balzo Jan knew the rules of the game better than I;
  so I opened the throttle wide and soon left the remaining Kapars far behind,
  and shortly after, they turned and resumed their flight toward Kapara.</p>

  <p>There are two pilot seats and controls in the front cockpit, as well as
  the additional controls in the after cockpit. However, two men are seldom
  seated in the front cockpit, except for training purposes, as there is only
  one gun there and the Unisan military chiefs don't believe in wasting man
  power. However, the seat was there, and I asked Balzo Jan to come up and sit
  with me.</p>

  <p>"If you see any more Kapars," I said, "you can go back to your gun."</p>

  <p>"Do you know," he said, after he had crawled up into the forward cockpit
  and seated himself beside me, "that we have been so busy since you first
  discovered me climbing into your ship that I haven't had a chance to ask you
  who you are. I know a lot of men in the fighting service, but I don't recall
  ever having seen you before."</p>

  <p>"My name is Tangor," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said, "you're the man that my sister discovered without any
  clothes on after a raid several months ago."</p>

  <p>"The same," I said, "and she is mourning you for dead. I saw her at the
  Harkases the night before we took off for this last raid."</p>

  <p>"My sister would not mourn," he said proudly.</p>

  <p>"Well, she was mourning inwardly," I replied, "and sometimes that's worse
  for a woman than letting herself go. I should think a good cry now and then
  would be a relief to the women of Poloda."</p>

  <p>"I guess they used to cry," he said, "but they don't any more. If they
  cried every time they felt like crying, they'd be crying all the time; and
  they can't do that, you know, for there is work to do. It is war."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap1-11"
     id="chap1-11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is war! That was the answer to everything. It governed
  their every activity, their every thought. From birth to death they knew
  nothing but war. Their every activity was directed at the one purpose of
  making their country more fit for war.</p>

  <p>"I should think you would hate war," I said to Balzo Jan.</p>

  <p>He looked at me in surprise. "Why?" he demanded. "What would we do with
  ourselves if there were no war?"</p>

  <p>"But the women," I said. "What of them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "it is hard on them. The men only have to die once, but
  the women have to suffer always. Yes; it is too bad, but I can't imagine what
  we would do without war."</p>

  <p>"You could come out in the sunshine, for one thing," I said, "and you
  could rebuild your cities, and devote some of your time to cultural pursuits
  and to pleasure. You could trade with other countries, and you could travel
  to them; and wherever you went you would find friends."</p>

  <p>Balzo Jan looked at me skeptically. "Is that true in your world?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not when I was last there," I had to admit, "but then, several of
  the countries were at war."</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "war is the natural state of man, no matter what world
  he lives in."</p>

  <p>We were over the southern tip of Unis now. The majestic peaks of the
  Mountains of Loras were at our left, and at our right the great river which
  rises in the mountains south of Orvis emptied into the sea, fifteen hundred
  miles from its source. It is a mighty river, comparable, I should say, to the
  Amazon. The country below us was beautiful in the extreme, showing few
  effects of the war, for they have many buried cities here whose Labour Corps
  immediately erase all signs of the devastating effects of Kapar raids as soon
  as the enemy has departed.</p>

  <p>Green fields stretched below us in every direction, attesting the fact
  that agriculture on the surface still held its own against the Kapars on this
  part of the continent; but I knew at what a price they raised their crops
  with low flying Kapar planes strafing them with persistent regularity, and
  bombers blasting great craters in their fields.</p>

  <p>But from high above this looked like heaven to me, and I wondered if it
  were indeed for me the locale of that after-life which so many millions of
  the people of my world hope and pray for. It seemed to me entirely possible
  that my transition to another world was not unique, for in all the vast
  universe there must be billions of planets, so far removed from the ken of
  Earth men that their existence can never be known to them.</p>

  <p>I mentioned to Balzo Jan what was passing in my mind and he said, "Our
  people who lived before the war had a religion, which taught that those who
  died moved to Uvala, one of the planets of our solar system which lies upon
  the other side of Omos. But now we have no time for religion; we have time
  only for war."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in a life hereafter, then?" I asked. "Well, I didn't
  either, once, but I do now."</p>

  <p>"Is it really true that you come from another world?" he asked. "Is it
  true that you died there and came to life again on Poloda?"</p>

  <p>"I only know that I was shot down by an enemy plane behind the enemy
  lines," I replied. "A machine-gun bullet struck me in the heart, and during
  the fifteen seconds that consciousness remained I remember losing control of
  my ship and going into a spin. A man with a bullet in his heart, spinning
  toward the ground from an altitude of ten thousand feet, must have died."</p>

  <p>"I should think so," said Balzo Jan, "but how did you get here?"</p>

  <p>I shrugged. "I don't know any more about it than you do," I replied.
  "Sometimes I think it is all a dream from which I must awake."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Maybe you are dreaming," he said, "but I am not. I am
  here, and I know that you are here with me. You may be a dead man, but you
  seem very much alive to me. How did it seem to die?"</p>

  <p>"Not bad at all," I replied. "I only had fifteen seconds to think about
  it, but I know that I died happy because I had shot down two of the three
  enemy planes that had attacked me."</p>

  <p>"Life is peculiar," he said. "Because you were shot down in a war on a
  world countless millions of miles away from Poloda, I am now alive and safe.
  I can't help but be glad, my friend, that you were shot down."</p>

  <p>It was a quiet day over Unis; we reached the mountains south of Orvis
  without sighting a single enemy plane, and after crossing the mountains I
  dropped to within about a hundred feet of the ground. I like to fly low when
  I can; it breaks the monotony of long flights, and we ordinarily fly at such
  tremendous altitudes here that we see very little of the terrain.</p>

  <p>As we dropped down I saw something golden glinting in the sunshine below
  us. "What do you suppose that is down there. I said to Balzo Jan, banking so
  that he could see it.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, "but it looks amazingly like a woman lying there;
  but what a woman would be lying out in the open for, so far from the city, I
  can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"I am going down to see," I said.</p>

  <p>I spiraled down and as we circled over the figure I saw that it was indeed
  a woman, lying upon her face&mdash;an unmarried woman, I knew, for her suit
  was of golden sequins. She lay very still, as though she were asleep.</p>

  <p>I put the plane down and taxied up close to her. "You stay at the
  controls, Balzo Jan," I said, for one must always think of Kapars and be
  ready to run, or fight, or hide.</p>

  <p>I dropped to the ground and walked over to the still form. The girl's
  helmet had fallen off, and her mass of copper red hair spread over and hid
  that part of her face which was turned up. I knelt beside her and turned her
  over, and as I saw her face my heart leaped to my throat&mdash;it was Harkas
  Yamoda, little Harkas Yamoda, crushed and broken.</p>

  <p>There was blood on her lips, and I thought she was dead; but I didn't want
  to believe it, I wouldn't believe it; and so I placed my ear against her
  breast and listened&mdash;and faintly I heard the beating of her heart. I
  lifted the little form in my arms, then, and carried it to the ship.</p>

  <p>"It is Harkas Yamoda," I said to Balzo Jan, as I passed her up to him;
  "she is still alive. Put her in the after cockpit." Then I sprang to the wing
  of the ship and told Balzo Jan to take the controls and bring the ship
  in.</p>

  <p>I got in with Harkas Yamoda and held her in my arms as gently as I could,
  while the ship bumped over the rough ground during the take-off. I wiped the
  blood from her lips; that was all I could do, that and pray. I had not prayed
  before since I was a little boy at my mother's knee. I remember wondering, if
  there were a God, if He could hear me, so very far away, for I had always
  thought of God as being somewhere up in our own heaven.</p>

  <p>It was only a matter of fifteen or twenty minutes before Balzo Jan set the
  ship down outside of Orvis and taxied down the ramp to our underground
  airdrome.</p>

  <p>There are always fleets of ambulances at every airdrome, for there are
  always wounded men in many of the ships that come in. Also, close by is an
  emergency hospital; and to this I drove with Harkas Yamoda, after telling
  Balzo Jan to notify her father.</p>

  <p>The surgeons worked over her while I paced the floor outside. They worked
  very quickly and she had only just been carried to her room when Harkas Yen,
  and Don, and Yamoda's mother came. The four of us stood around that silent,
  unconscious little form lying so quietly on her cot.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea how it happened?" I asked Harkas Yen.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes," he said, "she was on an outing with some of her friends
  when they were attacked by Kapars. The men put up a good fight and several of
  them were killed. The girls ran, but a Kapar overtook Yamoda and carried her
  away."</p>

  <p>"She must have jumped from the plane," said Don.</p>

  <p>"Planes!" said Yamoda's mother bitterly. "Planes! The curse of the world.
  History tells us that when they were first perfected and men first flew in
  the air over Poloda, there was great rejoicing, and the men who perfected
  them were heaped with honors. They were to bring the peoples of the world
  closer together. They were to break down international barriers of fear and
  suspicion. They were to revolutionize society by bringing all people
  together, to make a better and happier world in which to live. Through them
  civilization was to be advanced hundreds of years; and what have they done?
  They have blasted civilization from nine-tenths of Poloda and stopped its
  advance in the other tenth. They have destroyed a hundred thousand cities and
  millions of people, and they have driven those who have survived underground,
  to live the lives of burrowing rodents. Planes! The curse of all times. I
  hate them. They have taken thirteen of my sons, and now they have taken my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>"It is war," said Harkas Yen, with bowed head.</p>

  <p>"This is not war," cried the sad-faced woman, pointing at the still form
  upon the cot.</p>

  <p>"No," I said, "this is not war&mdash;it is rapine and murder."</p>

  <p>"What else can you expect of the Kapar's?" demanded Harkas Don. "But for
  this they shall pay.</p>

  <p>"For this they shall pay," I, too, swore.</p>

  <p>Then the surgeons came in and we looked at them questioningly. The senior
  surgeon put his hand on the shoulder of Yamoda's mother and smiled. "She will
  live," he said. "She was not badly injured."</p>

  <p>Yes; planes used in war are a curse to humankind, but thanks to a plane
  Balzo Maro's brother had been returned to her, and little Yamoda would
  live.</p>

  <p>Listen! The sirens are sounding the general alarm.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="part2"
     id="part2">PART II. TANGOR RETURNS</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="fore2"
     id="fore2">FOREWORD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Naturally, my imagination has been constantly intrigued by
  speculation as to the fate of Tangor, since his unseen, perhaps ghostly,
  fingers typed the story of his advent upon Poloda, that mysterious planet
  some 450,000 light years from Earth; typed them upon my own machine one
  midnight while I sat amazed, incredulous, and fascinated, with my hands
  folded in my lap.</p>

  <p>His story told of his death behind the German lines in September, 1959,
  when he was shot down in a battle with three Messerschmitts, and of how he
  had found himself, alive, uninjured, and as naked as the day he was born, in
  another world.</p>

  <p>I hung upon every line that he wrote; his description of the underground
  city of Orvis with its great buildings that were lowered deep beneath the
  surface of the ground when the Kapar bombers flew over by thousands to drop
  their lethal bombs in the great war that has already lasted more than a
  hundred years.</p>

  <p>I followed his adventures after he became a flier in the air corps of
  Unis, the Polodan country of his adoption. I grieved with him at the bedside
  of little Harkas Yamoda; and there were tears of relief in my eyes, as there
  must have been in his, when the surgeons announced that she would live.</p>

  <p>And then the last line that he typed: "Listen! The sirens are sounding the
  general alarm."</p>

  <p>That was all. But I have sat before my typewriter at midnight many a night
  since that last line was typed by unseen hands. I have wondered if Tangor
  ever came back from the battle to which that general alarm called him, or if
  he died a second death and, perhaps, a final one.</p>

  <p>I had about given up my midnight vigils as useless, when one night
  recently, shortly before midnight, I was awakened by a hand upon my shoulder.
  It was a moonlight night. The objects in the room were faintly visible, yet I
  could see no one. I switched on the reading light at the head of my bed.
  Other than myself there was no one in the room, or at least no one I could
  see; and then I heard and saw the space bar of my typewriter moving up and
  down with something that seemed like a note of urgency.</p>

  <p>As I started to get out of bed, I saw a sheet of typewriter paper rise
  from my desk as though endowed with life and place itself in the typewriter.
  By the time I reached my desk and sat down before the machine, those ghostly
  fingers had already started to type the story which you are about to
  read.</p>

  <p>Tangor had returned!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-1"
     id="chap2-1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That general alarm certainly called us to a real battle. The
  Kapars sent over ten thousand planes, and we met them over the Bay of Hagar
  with fully twenty thousand. Perhaps a thousand of them got through our lines
  to drop their bombs over Orvis, those that our pursuit planes did not
  overtake and shoot down; but we drove the others out over the Karagan Ocean,
  into which ships plunged by the thousands.</p>

  <p>At last they turned and fled for home, but we pursued them all the way to
  Ergos, flying low over the very city, strafing them as they taxied for their
  ramps; then we turned back, perhaps ten thousand ships out of the twenty
  thousand that had flown out to meet the Kapars. We had lost ten thousand
  ships and perhaps fifty thousand men, but we had practically annihilated the
  Kapar fleet and had saved Unis from a terrific bombing; and on the way back,
  we met a few straggling Kapars returning, shooting down every last one of
  them.</p>

  <p>Once more all three of my gunners were killed, while I came through
  without a scratch. Either I have a charmed life or else, having died once, I
  cannot die again.</p>

  <p>I saw practically nothing of Harkas Yamoda while she was convalescing, as
  the doctors had ordered that she have perfect rest; but a flier has to have
  relaxation, and he has to have girl friends&mdash;he sees altogether too much
  of men while he is on duty, as about half of those he does see are firing
  rifles or machine guns or cannons at him. It is a nerve-racking business, and
  the majority of us are always on edge most of the time when we are on the
  ground. It is a strange thing; but that restlessness and nervousness seem to
  leave me when I am in the air; and of course when you are in battle, you
  haven't time to think of such things.</p>

  <p>There was a girl working in the office of the Commissioner for War, whom I
  had seen and talked to many times. She was always exceedingly pleasant to me
  and as she seemed a nice sort, intelligent and witty, I finally asked her to
  have dinner with me.</p>

  <p>We had a mightily pleasant evening together, and after that I saw a great
  deal of her when I was off duty. She liked to get me to talk about my own
  world, way off there so far beyond Canapa.</p>

  <p>Once, after we had been going together for some time, Morga Sagra said she
  couldn't understand why it was I was so loyal to Unis when I hadn't been born
  there and had no relations, even, on the planet.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you had come down in Kapara," she asked, "instead of in
  Unis?"</p>

  <p>I shrugged. "I don't like to think of it," I said; "I am sure that I never
  could have fought for and been loyal to the Kapars."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about them," she asked, "except what we Unisans have
  told you? and naturally, we are biased. As a matter of fact, I don't think
  they are a bad sort at all, and their form of government is based upon a much
  more enduring concept than ours."</p>

  <p>"Just what do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is based on war," said Morga Sagra, "and war is the natural state of
  the human race. War is their way of life. They are not always thinking of
  peace as are we."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like peace?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No!" she exclaimed, "I should hate it. Think of having to associate with
  men who never fought. It would be disgusting. If I were a man, I would join
  the Kapars, for they are going to win the war eventually."</p>

  <p>"That is a very dangerous thing to say, Morga Sagra," I told her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid to tell you," she said; "you are no Unisan, you owe no
  more allegiance to Unis than you do to Kapara. Listen, Tangor; don't be
  stupid. You are an alien here; you have made a good record as a fighter, but
  what can it get you?&mdash;nothing. You will always be an alien, who can do
  no more than fight for Unis&mdash;and probably get killed in the long
  run."</p>

  <p>"Well, and what do you want me to do, stop fighting?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, leaning close to me and whispering; "I want you to go to
  Kapara and take me with you. You and I could go far there with the Unisan
  military secrets we could take with us."</p>

  <p>I was immeasurably shocked, but I did not let her see it. The little fool
  was a traitor, and if she had thought that I was greatly shocked by what she
  had said, she would be afraid that I might turn her in to the authorities. If
  she would turn against Unis for no reason whatsoever other than a perverted
  admiration for the Kapars, she certainly wouldn't hesitate to turn against me
  if she had reason to fear me. She was right, I am an alien here. Any lie that
  she could make up might be believed.</p>

  <p>"You take me by surprise, Morga Sagra," I said; "I had never thought of
  such a thing. I don't believe that it could be done; the Kapars would never
  accept me."</p>

  <p>After that she evidently thought that I could be won over easily, for she
  told me that she had long been in touch with Kapar sympathizers in Orvis and
  knew two Kapar secret agents well.</p>

  <p>"I have discussed this matter with them," she said, "and they have
  promised me that you and I will be treated like kings of old if we can get to
  Ergos. That's the capital of Kapara," she added.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," I told her; "I have been there."</p>

  <p>"You have!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, to drop bombs on it. It would be amusing to go there now to live,
  and have my old comrades in arms dropping bombs on me."</p>

  <p>"Then you'll go?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Let me think it over, Morga Sagra," I said; "this is not something that a
  man can do without thought."</p>

  <p>So we left it that way, and the next day I went to the Commissioner for
  War and told him the whole story, and I didn't have even a single qualm of
  conscience for betraying Morga Sagra; she was a traitor and she tried to make
  a traitor of me. While I am on Poloda, Unis will be as dear to me as my own
  United States of America. I wear the uniform of her fighting force; I have
  been well treated; my friends are here; they trust me, as do my superiors and
  my fellow fighters. I could never betray them.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner for War is a crusty old fellow, and he almost blew up
  like one of his own bombs when he learned that a Kapar agent was employed in
  his department.</p>

  <p>"She'll be shot tomorrow!" he exploded, and then he thought a moment and
  calmed down. "Maybe it would be better to let her live," he said; "maybe we
  can use her. Come with me."</p>

  <p>He took me to the Eljanhai's office and there he had me repeat what I had
  told him. "It is too bad," said the Eljanhai; "I knew her father well; he was
  a brave officer. He was killed in battle when she was a little baby. I hate
  to think of ordering his daughter destroyed, but I suppose there is no other
  way."</p>

  <p>"I have another way," said the Commissioner for War. "I suggest that if
  Tangor will accept the mission, we let him accede to Morga Sagra's
  proposition. As you know, the Kapars are supposed to have perfected a power
  amplifier which will permit them to fly to great distances from Poloda,
  possibly to other planets. I have heard you say that you wished that we could
  get the drawings of this new amplifier." He turned to me. "It would be a very
  dangerous mission, Tangor, and one in which you might not possibly be able to
  succeed, but there would be a chance, if you were there. What do you say to
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I am in the service of Unis," I said; "whatever you wish me to do, I will
  do to the best of my ability."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said the Eljanhai, "but do you realize that the chances are
  about a thousand to one that you will be unsuccessful and that you will never
  get out of Kapara alive."</p>

  <p>"I realize that, sir," I said, "but I take similar chances almost ever day
  of my life."</p>

  <p>"Then it is settled," he said, "let us know when you are ready to go, and
  every arrangement will be made to facilitate your departure; and, by the way,
  when you get to Kapara, see if you can get any information as to the fate of
  one of our most valuable secret agents from whom we have not heard for two
  years; he is an officer named Handon Gar," and then he described the man very
  minutely to me, as I could not, of course, inquire about him, and
  furthermore, he had unquestionably changed his name after he reached
  Kapara.</p>

  <p>The two then gave me certain military information to report to the Kapars,
  information they were perfectly willing to trade for a chance to get the
  secret of the amplifier.</p>

  <p>I wondered just why they were so anxious to obtain the secret of this
  power amplifier and so I made bold to ask.</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly frank," said the Eljanhai, "Unis is tired of war; and we
  wish to send an expedition to one of the nearer planets, either Tonos or
  Antos, to see what conditions are there; and if they are better, eventually
  to transport all Unisans to one of these planets."</p>

  <p>What an amazing and stupendous project, it was staggering even to
  contemplate&mdash;an heroic migration unparalleled in history.</p>

  <p>"But if you get the secret," warned the Eljanhai, "you must destroy all
  copies of the plans you do not bring away with you, and destroy also all
  those who could reproduce them, so that the Kapars cannot follow. Our sole
  desire is to find some world free from war, and no world would be free from
  war if there were Kapars there."</p>

  <p>I saw Morga Sagra again that evening. "Well," she asked, "have you made up
  your mind?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "I have come to the conclusion that you were right; I
  owe these people nothing, and if the Kapars are going to win this war, I
  might as well be on the winning side."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," she said; "you will never regret it. I have made
  all the necessary arrangements for our entry into Kapara, but the problem of
  getting out of Unis is for you to solve."</p>

  <p>"I will take care of everything," I told her, "and in the meantime I think
  that we should not be seen together too much. Hold yourself in readiness to
  leave at any moment; I may call for you tomorrow or the next day."</p>

  <p>We parted then and I went out to the Harkases' to bid them good-bye.
  Yamoda was stronger and had been moved out into the garden, where she lay on
  a couch in the artificial sunlight which illuminates this underground city.
  She seemed so genuinely happy to see me that I hated to tell her that I was
  going away for an indefinite period. We had become such excellent friends
  that it saddened us both to realize that we might not see one another again
  for a considerable time, and her lip trembled when I told her that I had come
  to say good-bye. She seemed to sense that this was more than an ordinary
  parting to which the women of Unis are so accustomed.</p>

  <p>"How long will you be gone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose that you can't tell me where you are going, either."</p>

  <p>"No, I can't," I replied; "about all I can tell you is that it is a secret
  mission."</p>

  <p>She nodded and placed her hand on mine. "You will be careful of yourself,
  won't you, Tangor?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Yamoda, I will be careful; and I will try to get back as quickly as
  possible, for I shall miss you very much."</p>

  <p>"You have been doing very well without me lately," she said, with a
  mischievous twinkle in her eye; "is she such very good company?"</p>

  <p>"She is better than nobody," I replied, "and I get terribly lonesome when
  I can't come out here."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe I know her," she said; "she does not go with the same
  people I do."</p>

  <p>I thought I noticed just a trace of contemptuousness in that speech,
  something quite unlike Yamoda. "I have never met any of her friends," I said.
  Just then Yamoda's mother came into the garden, and we talked of other
  things. They insisted on my staying to dinner.</p>

  <p>When I left, later in the evening, it was very hard for me to say good-bye
  to them all, for the Harkases are my best friends in Unis, and Don and Yamoda
  are just like brother and sister to me; in fact their mother calls me her
  other son.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-2"
     id="chap2-2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Early the following morning, I called on the Commissioner
  for War, and told him that I planned on leaving that day. I explained in
  detail the procedure I wished to follow to get Morga Sagra out of Orvis, and
  he told me that everything would be arranged in accordance with my plans. He
  then gave me a sheaf of military documents which I was to turn over to the
  Kapars as proof of my good faith and of my potential value to them.</p>

  <p>"You will need something to meet expenses while you are there," he said,
  and he handed me a heavy leather pouch. "As there is no longer any monetary
  medium of international exchange," he continued, "you will have to do the
  best you can with the contents of this pouch, which contains gold and
  precious stones. I shall immediately instruct your squadron commander that
  you have been ordered to make a reconnaissance flight alone and that the
  mission is a secret one, he is to see that no one is in the hangar between
  the third and fourth hours after noon, as it is my wish that no one sees you
  depart. During that time, you can smuggle in your co-conspirator; and now
  good-bye, my boy, and good luck. The chances are that I shall never see you
  again, but I shall remember you as one who died gloriously for the honor and
  glory of Unis."</p>

  <p>That sounded altogether too much like an obituary, and I went away
  thinking of the little white cross somewhere in the Rhine valley. If what I
  had been told about the Kapars were true, I would have no little white cross
  there, as my body would be shipped off to serve as food for some of their
  subjugated peoples working in slavery for them.</p>

  <p>I called on Sagra at the third hour after noon. "Everything is arranged,"
  I told her, "and we shall be on our way within the hour."</p>

  <p>She had not smiled as she usually did when we met, and I noticed a certain
  constraint in her manner. Finally the cause of it came out, as she blurted,
  "What were you doing in conference with the Commissioner for War this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"How did you think I was going to get out of Orvis?" I demanded. "I had to
  work on the old chap a long time to get him to order me to make a
  reconnaissance flight alone."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "but this is dangerous business; and when one's
  life is constantly at stake, suspicion becomes almost an obsession.</p>

  <p>"I can well understand that," I said; "but if our mission is to be
  successful, we must trust one another fully."</p>

  <p>"I shan't doubt you again," she said, "but right now my nerves are on
  edge. I am really terrified, for I don't see how you are going to get me out
  of the city; and if you are caught trying it, we'll both be shot."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," I said; "just do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>We went out to my car then, and I had her get in the rear compartment, and
  when I was sure that no one was looking, I told her to lie down on the floor;
  then I threw an old robe over her.</p>

  <p>I drove directly to the hangar, which I found entirely deserted. I drove
  as close to my ship as I could and then had Sagra crawl into the gunner's
  compartment in the belly of the fuselage. A moment later I had taxied up the
  ramp and taken off.</p>

  <p>"Which way?" I asked Sagra, over the communicating system.</p>

  <p>"Northwest," she replied. "When can I get out of here? I don't like it
  down here."</p>

  <p>"In just a moment," I replied.</p>

  <p>By mutual agreement, Sagra had kept all of the plans covering our flight
  to Kapara and our entry into that country to herself. My job had been to
  simply get the military secrets and get us out of Orvis.</p>

  <p>A small hatchway in the ceiling of the compartment in which Sagra was led
  to the rear gunner's cockpit, and when I told her to come up with me, she
  came through this hatchway and climbed over into the forward cockpit.</p>

  <p>"Now," I said, "you can tell me why we are flying northwest if we are
  going to Kapara, which lies southwest of Unis."</p>

  <p>"It's a long way around, I know," she said, "but it's the only way in
  which we can eventually enter Kapara in a Kapar plane. In this plane and with
  that uniform of yours, we'd not get far in Kapara; so we are flying to Gorvas
  first."</p>

  <p>Gorvas is a city on the continent of Karis, the farthest removed from the
  continent of Epris on which Kapara is situated. It is a poor barren
  continent, and the one least affected by the war, for it possesses nothing
  that the Kapars want.</p>

  <p>After an uneventful flight, we landed at Gorvas. No fighting planes had
  come up to meet us, and no anti-aircraft shells had burst around us, as we
  had circled above Gorvas before landing; for the people of Karis know they
  have nothing to fear from Unis, and we received a friendly greeting from some
  officers at the airport.</p>

  <p>Morga Sagra had obtained forged credentials for us, and she had told me
  that my name hereafter would be Korvan Don, while she would keep her own name
  which was favorably known to her connections in Ergos, the capital of
  Kapara.</p>

  <p>After leaving the airport, Sagra told the driver of the public conveyance
  we had hired, to drive to a certain house, the address of which had been
  given her by a Kapar agent in Orvis.</p>

  <p>Gorvas is a poor city, but at least it is not underground, although, as I
  was told, every building has its bombproof cellar. Occasionally we saw bomb
  craters, indicating that the Kapars came even here to this far away, barren
  country, either because the Kerisans were known to be friendly with Unis or
  just to satisfy their inordinate lust for destruction.</p>

  <p>Our driver took us to a poor part of town and stopped before a mean little
  one-story stone house where we dismissed him. We stood there until he had
  driven away; then Sagra led the way along the street to the third house,
  after which she crossed the street to the house directly opposite. It was all
  quite mysterious, but it showed the care with which everything had been
  arranged to avoid leaving a well-marked trail.</p>

  <p>Approaching the door of this house, which was a little more pretentious
  than the one before which we had first stopped, Sagra knocked three times in
  rapid succession, and then twice more at intervals; and after a moment the
  door was opened by a hard-faced, scowling man.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I am Morga Sagra," replied my companion, "and this is Korvan Don."</p>

  <p>"Come in," said the man; "I've been expecting you. Let me see your
  credentials."</p>

  <p>Sagra handed him a perfectly blank piece of paper. I was standing near the
  man, and when he opened it up, I saw that there was nothing on it.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said the man, and then he went to a desk; and, seating himself
  there, took what appeared to be a pocket flashlight from one of the drawers
  and shone its light upon the paper.</p>

  <p>The light must have made writing on the paper visible for I could see him
  passing it back and forth and that his eyes followed it. Presently he got up
  and handed the paper back to Sagra.</p>

  <p>"You will remain here," he said, "while I go and complete arrangements."
  Then he left us.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that fellow's name?" I asked Sagra.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"What is it? Why didn't you introduce me?"</p>

  <p>"His name is none of your business," said Sagra. "You must learn not to
  ask questions, Korvan Don; however, just to satisfy your curiosity, I don't
  mind telling you that his name is Gompth."</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful name," I said, "but as far as I am concerned you needn't
  have told me what it was. His name doesn't interest me any more than his
  face."</p>

  <p>"Don't say things like that," snapped Sagra. "He is a very important
  person, and it is not wise to make unpleasant remarks about important
  persons. Now be sure not to let him know that you know his name, for that is
  not the name that he goes by here."</p>

  <p>I was getting my introduction to the fear and suspicion which hangs like a
  pall over everything Kapar. I had said that I did not care whether I knew
  this man's name or not, for how could I know that one day I should be very
  glad that I did know it.</p>

  <p>In about an hour, Gompth returned. He had brought with him civilian
  clothing such as is worn by the inhabitants of Karis, and after we had
  changed into it, he drove us out into the country, where he turned an old
  Karisan plane over to us.</p>

  <p>It was not until Sagra and I were in the plane that he gave us our final
  instructions, and handed us credentials. He directed us to fly to a city
  called Pud, on the continent of Auris, and report to a man with the poetic
  name of Frink.</p>

  <p>"What will become of my plane?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make to you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"It makes a great deal of difference to me," I snapped, for I was getting
  fed up with all this rudeness and secrecy. "I expect that, unquestionably, I
  shall be sent on missions to Unis; and if I am, I shall need my plane and my
  uniform."</p>

  <p>He eyed me suspiciously before he replied. "How could you ever return to
  Unis without being destroyed as a traitor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I used my head before I left Orvis," I replied; "I arranged to be
  sent out on reconnaissance flight, and I can think of a hundred excuses to
  explain even a long absence."</p>

  <p>"If you ever need your plane or your uniform," he said, "they will be here
  when you return."</p>

  <p>I breathed more freely when we rose into the clear air and left Mr. Gompth
  behind. His was a most depressing personality. His conversation gave the
  impression that he was snapping at you like an ill-natured dog, and not once
  while we were with him had he smiled. I wondered if all the Kapars were like
  that.</p>

  <p>In Pud we found Frink by the same devious means that we had arrived at the
  house of Gompth, only here there was a slight difference; we were allowed to
  call Frink by name, because Frink was not his name.</p>

  <p>We stayed overnight in Pud; and in the morning, Frink gave us Kapar
  clothes, and later furnished us with a Kapar plane, a very excellent plane
  too; and for that I was glad, as I had not been very happy crossing the
  Voldan Ocean from Karis to Auris in the ancient crate that Gompth had
  furnished us. Before us lay a flight of some two thousand miles across the
  Mandan Ocean from Auris to Kapara.</p>

  <p>The crossing was monotonous and uneventful, but after we got over Kapara,
  and were winging toward Ergos, we sighted a squadron of Unisan planes that
  were doubtless on reconnaissance. I tuned away in an effort to avoid them,
  but they took after us.</p>

  <p>The ship I was piloting was a very swift scouting plane lightly armed.
  There was a bow gun which I could operate and one gun in an after cockpit,
  which Morga Sagra could not have operated even had I wished her to. I had no
  intention of firing on an Unisan plane under any circumstances, and so I
  turned and ran.</p>

  <p>They chased me out across the Mandan Ocean for nearly a thousand miles
  before they gave up and turned back. I followed, keeping just within sight of
  them, until they bore to the south with the evident intention of passing
  around the southern end of the continent of Epris; then I opened the throttle
  wide and streaked for Ergos.</p>

  <p>When we ran down a ramp into the city, we were immediately surrounded by
  men in green uniforms; and an officer gruffly demanded our credentials. I
  told him that our instructions were to hand them to Gurrul and then he
  bundled us into a car, and we were driven off, surrounded by green-clad
  members of the Zabo, the secret police of Kapara.</p>

  <p>Ergos is a large city, sprawling around deep underground. We passed first
  through a considerable district in which there were indications of the direst
  poverty.</p>

  <p>The buildings were principally flimsy shelters and sometimes only holes in
  the ground, into which people scurried when they saw the green uniforms of
  the Zabo. But presently we came to more substantial buildings, which were all
  identical except in the matter of size. There was not the slightest
  indication of ornamentation on any of them. The ride was most uninteresting,
  just one monotonous mile after another until we approached the center of the
  city where the buildings suddenly became rococo in their ornateness.</p>

  <p>The car stopped before one of the more hideous these buildings, a
  multi-colored atrocity, the facade of which was covered with carved figures
  and designs.</p>

  <p>We were hustled out of the car and into the building, and a moment later
  we were ushered into the office of Gurrul, Chief of the Zabo, the most feared
  man in all Kapara.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-3"
     id="chap2-3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gurrul was a gross man with a cruel mouth and close-set
  eyes. He scrutinized us in silence for a full minute, as though he were
  trying to read our in-most thoughts. He was really fixing in his mind every
  detail of our appearance, and he would know us again whenever or wherever he
  saw us and only the cleverest of disguises could deceive him. It is said of
  him that Gurrul knows a million people thus, but that seems to me like an
  exaggeration.</p>

  <p>He took our credentials and examined them carefully; then he asked for the
  military secrets I had brought from Orvis, and when I turned them over to him
  he glanced through them hurriedly, giving no indication of any great interest
  in them.</p>

  <p>"You flew for the enemy?" he demanded of me.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I knew no other country than Unis," I explained.</p>

  <p>"Why did you turn against the country of your birth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Unis is not the country of my birth."</p>

  <p>"Where were you born?"</p>

  <p>"On another planet in another solar system millions of miles from
  here."</p>

  <p>He scowled at me fiercely and pounded his desk until everything on it
  danced. "You dare stand there and tell me such a lie, you fool!" he cried;
  "you, a filthy Unisan, dare insult my intelligence thus. Possibly you have
  never heard of Gurrul, you idiot. If you had, you would have cut your own
  throat before you came to him with such a story."</p>

  <p>"Most high," said Morga Sagra timidly, "I believe that he speaks the
  truth&mdash;everyone in Orvis believes him."</p>

  <p>He wheeled on her angrily. "Who told you to speak?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, most high," she said. She was trembling all over, and I was
  afraid that her knees were going to give away beneath her.</p>

  <p>Gurrul turned to one of his lieutenants. "Have them searched and then lock
  them up," he ordered, and that was the end of our reception in Kapara, where
  they were going to receive us with open arms and load us with honors.</p>

  <p>My gold and jewels were taken from me, and Morga Sagra and I were locked
  up in a cell in the basement of the Zabo headquarters. Our cell was nothing
  but an iron cage, and I could see corridor after corridor of them closely
  packed together, and all of them appeared to have occupants, sometimes six or
  eight people jammed into a cage scarcely large enough for two.</p>

  <p>Most of our fellow prisoners whom I could see sat dejectedly on the stone
  floor of their cages, their heads bowed upon their chests; but there were
  others who gibbered and screamed, those whom torture and confinement had
  driven mad. When the screaming annoyed a guard too much, he would come down
  to the cage and turn a hose upon the screaming inmate. From the first hour
  that we were there, for a solid hour, one of the poor creatures screamed
  incessantly. One guard after another turned the hose on him, but still he
  screamed. Finally the head keeper came in, an officer covered with gold
  braid, medals, and brass buttons. He walked up to the maniac's cage and
  deliberately shot him through the heart. He did it as casually as one might
  swat a fly, and then he walked away without a backward glance.</p>

  <p>"You must be very happy," I said to Morga Sagra.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"You are in your beloved Kapara at last, surrounded by your dear
  friends."</p>

  <p>"Hush," she cautioned, "someone will hear you."</p>

  <p>"Why should I hush?" I asked. "Don't you want them to know how fond you
  are of them?"</p>

  <p>"I am fond of them," she said; "this is all a terrible mistake, but it is
  your fault&mdash;you never should have told that story to Gurrul."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't want me to lie to the most high, would you?"</p>

  <p>"You must not use that tone of voice when you speak of anyone here," she
  whispered; "the first thing you know, you'll get us both beheaded."</p>

  <p>We were kept in that vile hole for a week, and almost every waking hour we
  expected to be taken out and destroyed. Morga Sagra was virtually a nervous
  wreck when, at last, they did come for us.</p>

  <p>Sagra was so weak from fright that the guards had to support her as we
  were lead along a corridor. Finally one of them said to her, "You have
  nothing to fear; you are going to be released."</p>

  <p>At that Sagra collapsed completely and sat down on the stone floor. The
  guards laughed and picked her up and practically carried her the rest of the
  way. They were still carrying her when I was hustled off down another
  corridor.</p>

  <p>They took me from the building through a rear doorway and put me into what
  looked like a big green moving van. It was so filled with humanity that they
  had to push me in and then slammed the doors on me quickly before I fell out.
  There was an iron barred window in front, and a guard with a rifle in his
  hand sat facing it.</p>

  <p>As soon as the doors were closed and locked, the truck started off, the
  human load swaying to and fro, trampling on each others toes and cursing
  beneath its breath. That was a ride to be long remembered for its
  discomforts.</p>

  <p>The heat from the men's bodies became absolutely oppressive, and the air
  so foul that one could scarcely breathe.</p>

  <p>The vehicle moved at a high rate of speed. How long we were in it, I do
  not know; but I should imagine about two hours, because it seemed like ten;
  but at last it stopped and turned around and was backed up to stop again.
  Then the doors were opened, and we were ordered out.</p>

  <p>I saw before me a very large enclosure, surrounded by a high wire fence.
  There were open sheds along two sides. There were several hundred men in the
  enclosure, and they were all dressed alike in black clothes with big white
  numbers across the front and back. I didn't have to be told that I was in a
  prison camp.</p>

  <p>There was sort of an office by the gate where we were taken from the
  truck, and here our names were entered in a book and we were given prison
  uniforms and numbers. Then we were ordered into the enclosure with the other
  prisoners. They were a filthy, emaciated lot with the most hopeless
  expressions I have ever seen on human faces. When I had been taken from my
  cell, I had felt that I was going to be beheaded, but I could conceive that
  this was infinitely worse.</p>

  <p>I had asked the officer who had checked us in why I was being imprisoned
  and for how long, but he had just told me to shut up and speak only when I
  was spoken to.</p>

  <p>This was a work camp, and when I say work that doesn't half describe it.
  We were usually employed on the hardest kind of manual labour for sixteen
  hours a day. There was one day of rest in every ten; it had been upon one of
  the rest days that I had arrived. There were both men and women in the camp,
  and they came from nearly every country of Poloda. We were treated just like
  animals, the prison clothes they gave us had to last a year; and we only had
  the one suit in which we worked and slept. Most of the men, and women too,
  were in nothing but rags. The food that was given us was indescribable. It
  was thrown into troughs twice a day just as food is given to hogs. Men and
  women both were insulted, beaten, kicked, often killed. We were not allowed
  to use names even among ourselves&mdash;just our numbers.</p>

  <p>Day and night, guards patrolled just outside the wire fence; and if they
  saw prisoners talking, they yelled at them to stop and sometimes they came
  inside and beat them. Nevertheless we did talk, for it was hard to stop us
  after dark; and finally I made a few friends.</p>

  <p>There was one who said that he came from Orvis, with whom I became quite
  friendly, although I knew it was dangerous, as the Kapars planted many spies
  in these camps. Finally, however, I came to the conclusion that this Tunzo
  Bor was all right, and so I asked him if he knew a man named Handon Gar.</p>

  <p>Immediately he was all suspicion. "No," he said, "I don't know anyone by
  that name. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"I have a message for him," I replied.</p>

  <p>"From whom?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"From a friend in Orvis."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know any Handon Gar," he insisted, "and if he is here you
  may rest assured he is not known by that name."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," I said, "but I certainly wish that I could find him, as I
  should like to deliver my message."</p>

  <p>I was sure that he was lying and that he did know Handon Gar and that it
  was quite possible that the man might be in this very camp, but I saw that it
  was useless to pursue the question further as it would only make Tunzo Bor
  all the more suspicious of me.</p>

  <p>We were worked very hard and were underfed. It seemed to me that the
  Kapars were very stupid; they need labour, yet they treat the men in labour
  camps so badly that the mortality rate is much higher than necessary. I
  noticed that the Kapars are always pressed for food, but they are extremely
  short-sighted to beat men to death for nothing or overwork them so they drop
  in their tracks, when these same men might be producing more food for
  them.</p>

  <p>The lot of the free workers is a little better, but not much; they are
  serfs, but they are not locked up in prison camps. However, they are
  overworked and treated cruelly, although many of them are native Kapars as
  well as peoples of conquered countries. The soldiers fare much better than
  the workers, and the members of the Zabo live well, for everyone is afraid of
  them; even the army officers and those highly placed politically live little
  better, though they live off the fat of the land, if there is any fat in
  Kapara.</p>

  <p>After a week of hard labour and poor food, I was given an easy job,
  working in the garden of the officer in charge of the camp. An armed guard
  always accompanied me and remained with me while I worked. He did not abuse
  me, nor did any of the guards in the prison compound. I was even given good
  food occasionally from the officer's kitchen. I could not understand it, but
  I was afraid to ask any questions, but finally the guard himself volunteered
  some information.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, anyway?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am No. 267M9436," I replied.</p>

  <p>"No," he said; "I mean what is your name?"</p>

  <p>"I thought we weren't supposed to use any names," I reminded him.</p>

  <p>"If I tell you to, you can," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, my name is Korvan Don," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Where are you from?"</p>

  <p>"Orvis."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I can't understand it," he said.</p>

  <p>"Understand what?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why orders have been given that you shall be treated so much better than
  the other prisoners," he explained; "and they come straight from Gurrul,
  too."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know," I replied, but I had an idea that it might be
  because Gurrul was still investigating me and might be coming to the
  conclusion that I could be of value to the Kapars. I knew perfectly well that
  I wasn't being treated this way because of any humanitarian reasons.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-4"
     id="chap2-4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When the sky is not overcast, the Polodan nights are
  gorgeous in the extreme. There is a constant procession of planets passing
  across the heavens, following each other in stately procession throughout the
  night; and thus clear nights are quite well lighted, especially by the nearer
  planets.</p>

  <p>It was on such a clear night, about three weeks after I had been brought
  to the prison camp, that a fellow prisoner came close to me and whispered, "I
  am Handon Gar."</p>

  <p>I scrutinized him very closely to see if I could recognize him from the
  description given me by the Commissioner for War.</p>

  <p>This man was terribly emaciated and looked like an old man, but gradually
  I recognized him. He must have been subjected to the cruelest of treatment
  during the two years that he had been here.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said presently, "I recognize you."</p>

  <p>"How can you recognize me?" he demanded, instantly suspicious; "I do not
  know you, and you never knew me. Who are you, and what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I recognized you from the description given me by the Commissioner for
  War," I explained. "I know that you are Handon Gar, and that I can trust you.
  My name is Tangor; I am know here as Korvan Don. I was sent here on a mission
  by the Eljanhai and the Commissioner for War," I continued in a low whisper,
  "and was instructed to ascertain what your fate had been."</p>

  <p>He smiled sourly. "And now you are in the same boat as I; I'm afraid
  they'll never learn what became of either of us."</p>

  <p>"Is Tunzo Bor all right?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he suspected you. However, I did too, but I couldn't see how I
  could be any worse off if I told you my name. I do not recall ever having
  heard yours. Where did you live in Unis, and what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I lived in Orvis and was a pilot in the fighting service."</p>

  <p>"It is strange that I never met you," he said, and I could see that he was
  becoming suspicious again.</p>

  <p>"It is not so strange," I said; "I am sure that I know only a very few of
  the thousands of pilots in the service; one could not know them all. Do you
  know Harkas Don?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, very well," he replied</p>

  <p>"He is my best friend," I said.</p>

  <p>He was silent for some time, and then he said, "How are Don's
  brothers?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't any," I replied; "they have all been killed in the war."</p>

  <p>"And his sisters?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He only has one sister," I replied; "Yamoda. I saw her the night before I
  left. She had had an accident, but she is all right now."</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "if you know these people so intimately, you must be all
  right. You know we have to be careful here."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I understand," I replied.</p>

  <p>Again he was silent for a few moments, and then he leaned closer to me and
  whispered, "We are going to make a break in a few days; Tunzo Bor and I and a
  couple of others. We have it all planned. Do you want to come along?"</p>

  <p>"I can't," I replied; "I haven't fulfilled my mission yet."</p>

  <p>"You can't fulfill it while you're in a work camp," he said, "and you'll
  never get out. You might just as well make a break with us. If we get back to
  Orvis, I'll explain to the Eljanhai that I advised you to escape while there
  was a chance."</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," I replied, "I shall get out of here."</p>

  <p>"You seem very sure," he said, and I noticed that he looked at me
  peculiarly, and I had a feeling that he already regretted telling me what he
  had. I was about to try to reassure him, when a guard ordered us to stop
  talking.</p>

  <p>A couple of days later, which was a rest day, a guard called to me to come
  over to the wire fence, and there I found Morga Sagra awaiting me. It was
  quite unusual for prisoners to be allowed to have visitors, and I could see
  that it aroused a great deal of interest and comment in the compound.</p>

  <p>"I have been working hard for your release," she told me in a whisper,
  "but Gurrul is still unconvinced. If you have heard of anything suspicious
  here&mdash;anything the Zabo would like to know of you will report it, it
  will prove that you are all right, and it will be much easier to get you
  out."</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing," I said; "we are not allowed to do much talking,
  and anyway, everyone here is suspicious of everyone else."</p>

  <p>"Well, keep your ears open, though I think that I'll soon have you out
  anyway. The thing that has Gurrul guessing is your appearance; you know, you
  don't look much like a native of any Polodan country; and so he is commencing
  to think that your story of your origin may be true."</p>

  <p>"How are you getting along?" I asked her.</p>

  <p>"All right," she said. "I have a nice apartment, and they are treating me
  all right, but I am always being watched; however, it is a grand place to
  live; these are real people; they live for war&mdash;a great race, a noble
  race."</p>

  <p>"And a very hospitable people," I said.</p>

  <p>Her eyes narrowed. "Be careful, Korvan Don," she said. "You can go too far
  even with me. Remember that I am a Kapar now."</p>

  <p>I laughed. "You always insist on putting the wrong interpretation on
  things I say, Sagra."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," she snapped.</p>

  <p>Shortly after she left, Handon Gar approached me. "You'll get out all
  right, you damn cur," he whispered under his breath. "I know that woman, I
  always thought that she was a traitor. I suppose that you told her all about
  the plan Tunzo Bor and I have to escape."</p>

  <p>Once again a guard interrupted and made us stop talking before I could
  explain. But could I explain? I was sorry that he believed as he did; but
  there was nothing that I could do about it, for I could not tell even him all
  the details of my mission.</p>

  <p>And then, the very next day, his suspicions must have been definitely
  confirmed, as a messenger came from Gurrul with an order for my immediate
  release; and to make it appear all the worse, Morga Sagra accompanied the
  messenger and threw her arms around me.</p>

  <p>I was taken by underground railway to Ergos and immediately to Gurrul's
  office in the headquarter's building of the Zabo. He talked to me for about
  half an hour, asking me many questions concerning the other world and solar
  system from which I said I came.</p>

  <p>"You certainly are no Polodan," he said, "there never was a human being
  like you, but I don't see how you could have been transported from another
  solar system."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," I admitted, "but there are many things in the universe
  that none of us understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, Morga Sagra has vouched for you, and I am taking her word for it,"
  he said; then he told me that quarters had been reserved for me, and that he
  would send a man with me to show me where they were located. "I think I can
  use you later on," he said; "so hold yourself in readiness. Do not leave your
  quarters without leaving word where you are going and never leave the city
  without my permission;" then he called into the room the man who was to show
  me to my quarters and dismissed me.</p>

  <p>I knew that he was still suspicious of me, but that was not at all
  surprising as the secret police are always suspicious of everybody and
  everything. However, when I whispered to him some of the military secrets I
  had been ordered by the Eljanhai to give him orally, his attitude changed a
  little; and he was almost amiable as he bid me goodbye.</p>

  <p>When I reached my new quarters, the door was opened by a rather nice
  looking chap in the livery of a servant.</p>

  <p>"This is your master, Korvan Don," said the green-uniformed Zabo agent who
  accompanied me.</p>

  <p>The man bowed. "My name is Lotar Canl, sir," he said; "I hope that I shall
  be able to satisfy you."</p>

  <p>Morga Sagra's apartment was in the same building as mine; and almost
  immediately we commenced to be invited out and entertained, but I had the
  feeling that we were being constantly watched. Well, so is everyone in
  Kapara. The entire nation lives in an atmosphere of intrigue and suspicion.
  The army fears the Zabo, the Zabo hates the army; everyone fears the five top
  men of the regime, each of whom fears the others. The head of the nation is
  called the Pom Da, literally the Great I. The present Pom Da has ruled for
  ten years. I suppose he had a name once, but it is never used; he is just the
  Great I, a cruel and cunning monster who has ordered many of his best friends
  and closest relatives destroyed.</p>

  <p>Morga Sagra is a most sagacious girl; she was cut out by nature for
  intrigue, treason, and espionage. She thinks far ahead and lays her plans
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>Everywhere that she went, she told people that I was from another world.
  She did this not so much to attract attention to me, but to help convince the
  Kapars that I had no ties in Unis and no reason to be loyal to that country.
  She wanted them to understand that I would be no traitor to Kapara, and
  eventually her plan bore fruit&mdash;the Great I sent for me.</p>

  <p>Lotar Canl, my man, was evidently greatly impressed when he gave me the
  message. "You can go very far in Kapara, sir," he said, "if the Pom Da
  becomes interested in you; I am very proud to serve you, sir."</p>

  <p>I already knew that I might go far if the Pom Da noticed me, but in what
  direction I was not certain&mdash;the paths of glory sometimes lead but to
  the grave.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-5"
     id="chap2-5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When I reached the ornate building which houses the head of
  Kapara, I was first carefully searched for concealed weapons and then
  escorted by two heavily armed guards to a room presided over by a grim,
  elaborately uniformed and decorated official. Here I waited for about half an
  hour, my two guards sticking close to me; then the door at the far end of the
  room opened, and another officer appeared and called my name.</p>

  <p>The guards arose with me and escorted me to the door of an enormous
  chamber, at the far end of which a man sat behind a huge desk. The guards
  were dismissed at the doorway and told to wait, and two officers took their
  places and escorted me the length of the room into the presence of the Pom
  Da.</p>

  <p>He is not a large man, and I think that he appears even smaller than he is
  because of his very evident nervousness, fear, and suspicion.</p>

  <p>He just sat and eyed me for what must have been a full minute before he
  spoke. His expression was venomous, seeming to reflect the deepest hatred;
  but I was to learn later that this expression was not reserved for anyone in
  particular; it was almost habitual with him, and this is understandable
  because his whole ideology is based on hate.</p>

  <p>"So you are Korvan Don, the traitor?" he shot at me.</p>

  <p>"I am no traitor," I said.</p>

  <p>One of the officers seized me roughly by the arm. "When you address the
  Pom Da," he shouted angrily, "always refer to him as the Highest Most
  High."</p>

  <p>"You are betraying Unis," said the Pom Da, ignoring the interruption.</p>

  <p>"Unis is not my country, Highest Most High."</p>

  <p>"You claim to be from another world&mdash;from another solar system. Is
  that right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Highest Most High," I replied.</p>

  <p>"One Highest Most High in a conversation is sufficient," snapped the
  officer on my other side. I was learning Kapar high etiquette the hard
  way.</p>

  <p>The Pom Da questioned me for some time about the Earth and our solar
  system and how I could know how far away it was from Poloda. I explained
  everything to him to the best of my ability, but I doubt very much that he
  understood a great deal of what I said; the Kapars are not highly
  intelligent, their first Pom Da having killed off a majority of the
  intelligent people of his time and his successor destroying the remainder,
  leaving only scum to breed.</p>

  <p>"What were you in that strange world from which you say you came?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I was a flyer in the fighting forces of my country and also something of
  an inventor, having been at work on a ship in which I purposed traveling to
  another planet of our solar system."</p>

  <p>"How far from your Earth would this planet be?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About 48,000,000 miles," I replied.</p>

  <p>"That is a long way," he said. "Do you think that you could have done
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I had high hopes; in fact, I was almost on the verge of perfecting my
  ship when I was called away to war."</p>

  <p>"Tonas is less than six hundred thousand miles from Poloda," he mused. I
  could see that he had something on his mind, and I guessed what it was, or at
  least I hoped. He talked to me for over a half an hour and then he dismissed
  me, but before I left I asked him if he would order my gold and jewels
  returned to me.</p>

  <p>He turned to an officer standing at one end of his desk and instructed him
  to see that all of my belongings were returned to me; then the two officers
  and I backed out of the room. I had stood all during the interview, but that
  was not at all surprising as there was only one chair in the room and that
  was occupied by the Pom Da.</p>

  <p>The green Zabo car took me back to my quarters, and the men who
  accompanied me were most obsequious; and when Lotar Canl opened the door and
  saw them bowing to me and calling me Most High, he beamed all over.</p>

  <p>Morga Sagra came in from her apartment presently; and she was delighted
  with the honor that had been done me, and she didn't let any grass grow under
  her feet before she let it be known that I had been received by the Pom Da in
  an interview that lasted over a half an hour.</p>

  <p>Now we commenced to be invited into the homes of the highest; and when my
  gold and jewels were returned, as they were the day after my interview with
  the Pom Da, Sagra and I were able to splurge a little bit; so that we had a
  gay time in the capital of Kapara, where only the very highest have a gay
  time, or even enough to eat.</p>

  <p>Among our acquaintances was a woman named Gimmel Gora, with whom Morga
  Sagra had associated while I was in the prison camp; and she and her man,
  Grunge, were with us a great deal. They were not married, but then no one in
  Kapara is married; such silly, sentimental things as marriages were done away
  with nearly a hundred years ago. I did not like either Gimmel Gora or Grunge;
  in fact, I did not like any of the Kapars I had met so far, with the possible
  exception of my man, Lotar Canl; and, of course, I even suspected him of
  being an agent of the Zabo.</p>

  <p>The Kapars are arrogant, supercilious, stupid, and rude; and Grunge was no
  exception. I did not know what he did for a living; and, of course, I never
  asked, as I never showed the slightest curiosity about anything. If a
  stranger asks too many questions in Kapara, he is quite likely to find his
  head rolling around on the floor&mdash;they don't waste ammunition in
  Kapara.</p>

  <p>We were making a lot of acquaintances, but I was not any place with my
  mission. I was no nearer learning about the amplifier than I had been in
  Orvis. I kept talking about the ship I had been inventing in my own world,
  hoping in that way to get a hint from someone that would lead me on the right
  trail; but after two months in Ergos, I hadn't been able to get the slightest
  lead; it was just as though no such thing as a new powerful amplifier
  existed, and I commenced to wonder if the Commissioner for War had been
  misinformed.</p>

  <p>One day a green car stopped before the building in which my apartment was
  located. Lotar Canl, who had been at a front window saw it, and when a
  summons came at our door, he looked at me apprehensively. "I hope that you
  have not been indiscreet," he said as he went to open the door.</p>

  <p>I, too, hoped that I hadn't, for these grim, green-uniformed men do not
  call on one for the purpose of playing rummy or hopscotch.</p>

  <p>"Korvan Don?" asked one of the men, looking at me.</p>

  <p>I nodded, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Come with us."</p>

  <p>That was all&mdash;just like that: "Come with us"&mdash;just, "Come with
  us."</p>

  <p>I came, and they whisked me away to that horrible building with the carved
  facade, where I was ushered into Gurrul's office.</p>

  <p>He gave me that venomous stare of his for about a half a minute before he
  spoke. "Do you know what happens to People who have knowledge of crimes
  against the state and do not report them to the authorities?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, four men have escaped from the prison camp in which you were
  confined."</p>

  <p>"I do not see how that concerns me," I said.</p>

  <p>He had a large file of papers on the desk before him, and he thumbed
  through them. "Here," he said, "I find that on several dates you were found
  talking to Handon Gar and Tunzo Bor&mdash;in whispers!"</p>

  <p>"That is the only way one may talk there," I replied.</p>

  <p>He thumbed through the papers again. "It seems that you were extremely
  familiar with Tunzo Bor from the time you entered camp; you were evidently
  very familiar with both of these men, although I find no record that you were
  particularly familiar with the other two who escaped. Now," he shouted, "what
  were you whispering about?"</p>

  <p>"I was questioning them," I said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I question whomever I can for such information as I may get. You see, I
  was in the Zabo in my own country; so it is natural for me to acquire all the
  information I can from the enemy."</p>

  <p>"Did you get any information?"</p>

  <p>"I think I was about to when Morga Sagra came to see me; after that they
  wouldn't talk to me."</p>

  <p>"Before Handon Gar escaped he told several prisoners that you were a spy
  from Unis."</p>

  <p>As he growled this out, Gurrul looked as though he would like to chop my
  head off himself.</p>

  <p>I laughed. "I told him that myself," I said. "He evidently wanted to get
  even with me for almost fooling him."</p>

  <p>Gurrul nodded. "An intelligent agent would have done that very thing," he
  said. "I am glad that you have been able to clear yourself, as this is the
  first bad report I have had concerning you." then he dismissed me.</p>

  <p>As I walked slowly toward my apartment, just about a half a mile from the
  Zabo headquarters, I reviewed in my mind my interview with Gurrul; and I came
  to realize that he had exonerated me altogether too willingly. It was not
  like him. I had a feeling that he was still suspicious of me, and that he had
  done this to throw me off my guard that I might be more easily trapped if I
  were indeed disloyal. This conviction was definitely heightened before I
  reached my apartment. I had occasion to stop in two shops on the way; and, on
  each occasion, when I left the shop I saw the same man loitering nearby; I
  was being shadowed, and in a very crude and amateurish way at that. I thought
  that if the Zabo were no more efficient in other respects, I would have
  little to fear from them; but I did not let this belief lessen my
  caution.</p>

  <p>Before I reached my apartment, I met Grunge, who was walking with a man I
  did not know, and whom he introduced as Horthal Wend. Horthal was a
  middle-aged man with a very kindly face, which certainly differentiated him
  from most of the other Kapars I had met.</p>

  <p>They invited me into a drinking place and because I believed Grunge to be
  connected in some way with the Zabo, I accepted. Grunge had no visible means
  of support, yet he was always well supplied with money; and, for that reason,
  I suspected him of being either a member or a tool of the secret police. I
  felt that if I associated with men of this stamp and was always careful of
  what I said and did, only good reports of me could reach Gurrul. I also made
  it a point to try to never be alone with anyone&mdash;and never to whisper;
  there is nothing that makes a member of the Zabo more suspicious than a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>Grunge and Horthal Wend ordered wine. Grunge had to show a wine card in
  order to obtain it; and this strengthened my belief that he was connected
  with the Zabo, for only those who stand well with the government are issued
  wine cards.</p>

  <p>When I ordered a non-alcoholic drink, Grunge urged me to take wine; but I
  refused, as I never drink anything of the sort when I have an important duty
  to fulfill.</p>

  <p>Grunge seemed quite put out to think that I would not drink wine with him,
  and that convinced me that he had hoped that wine would loosen my
  tongue&mdash;a very mouldy trick of secret police. I found Horthal Wend as
  kindly in manner as in appearance, and I took quite a liking to him. Before I
  left him, he had extracted a promise from me that I would come and see him
  and his woman and bring Morga Sagra with me.</p>

  <p>Little did I dream then what the death of this kindly man would mean to
  me.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-6"
     id="chap2-6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The following evening, Sagra and I had dinner with Grunge
  and Gimmel Gora, and during the course of the evening I mentioned Horthal
  Wend and remarked that I had found him most intelligent and friendly.</p>

  <p>"I guess that he is intelligent enough," said Grunge, "but I find him a
  little too pleasant; that, to me, is an indication of sentimentality and
  softness, neither of which have any place in Kapar manhood. However, he
  stands very well with the Pom Da, and is, therefore, a safe man to know and
  cultivate, for our beloved Pom Da is never wrong in his estimate of
  men&mdash;in fact, he is never wrong in anything."</p>

  <p>I could not help but think that if sentiment and intelligence had no place
  in Kapar manhood, Grunge was an ideal Kapar.</p>

  <p>Grunge's use of the word beloved might seem to belie my statement that he
  was without sentiment, but it was really only the fawning expression of a
  sycophant and connoted more of fear than love.</p>

  <p>I was constantly mentally comparing Kapars with the Unisans. Here in
  Kapara all is suspicion and fear&mdash;fear of unseen malign forces that are
  all powerful; fear of your next door neighbor; fear of your servants; fear of
  your best friend, and suspicious of all.</p>

  <p>All during the evening, Sagra had seemed distrait. Grunge, on the other
  hand was quite talkative and almost affable. He directed most of his
  conversation and elephantine wit at Sagra and was correspondingly
  disagreeable and sarcastic when he spoke to Gimmel Gora.</p>

  <p>He was meticulously polite to me, which was unusual; as Grunge was seldom
  if ever polite to anyone of whom he was not afraid. "We have much to be
  thankful for in the wonderful friendship that has developed between us," he
  said to me; "It seems as though I had known you always, Korvan Don. It is not
  often in this life that two men meet who may mutually trust each other on
  short acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," I said, "but I think one learns to know almost
  instinctively who may be trusted and who may not.</p>

  <p>I wondered what he was driving at, and I did not have to wait long to
  discover.</p>

  <p>"You have been in Kapara for some time, now," he continued, "and I suppose
  that some of your experiences could not have been entirely pleasant; for
  instance the prison camp and the prison beneath the Zabo headquarters."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, freedom is always to be preferred to confinement," I
  replied; "but I have sense enough to realize that every precaution must be
  taken in a nation at war, and I admire the Kapars for their efficiency in
  this respect. While I did not enjoy being confined, I have no complaint to
  make, I was well-treated." If one may instinctively recognize a trustworthy
  friend, one may also instinctively recognize an unscrupulous enemy; and this
  I felt Grunge to be, for I was confident that he was attempting to cajole me
  into making some criticism that would incriminate me in the eyes of the
  Zabo.</p>

  <p>He looked a little crestfallen, but he said, "I am glad to hear you say
  that. Just between friends, tell me in confidence what you thought of
  Gurrul."</p>

  <p>"A highly intelligent man, well fitted for the post he occupies," I
  replied. "Although he must have to contend with all types of criminals,
  scoundrels, and traitors, he appears to me to be fair and just, without being
  soft or sentimental." I was learning to talk like a Kapar and to lie like one
  too.</p>

  <p>As Sagra and I walked home that night, I asked her what had been troubling
  her, for she had not seemed herself at all.</p>

  <p>"I am worried and frightened," she replied; "Grunge has been making
  advances to me, and Gimmel Gora knows it. I am afraid of both of them, for I
  believe that both are agents of the Zabo."</p>

  <p>"Neither one of us has anything to fear," I said. "Aren't we both good
  Kapars?"</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wonder if you are," she said.</p>

  <p>"At first I may have been a little critical," I said, "but that was before
  I understood the strength and beauty of their system. Now I am as good a
  Kapar as there is." From this speech it might be assumed that I was
  suspicious of Morga Sagra, and the assumption would be wholly correct. I was
  suspicious of Morga Sagra, of Grunge, of Gimmel Gora, of Lotar Canl, my
  man&mdash;in fact, of everybody. In this respect, at least, I had become a
  good Kapar.</p>

  <p>When I got home that night, I found that my quarters had been thoroughly
  ransacked. The contents of every drawer was scattered about on the floor; my
  rugs had been torn up, and my mattress cut open.</p>

  <p>While I was viewing the havoc, Lotar Canl came home. He looked around the
  place, and then, with the faintest of smiles on his lips he said, "Burglars.
  I hope that they got nothing of value, sir."</p>

  <p>Most of my gold and jewels are deposited in a safe place; but in addition
  to that which I carry on my person, I had left a handful of gold in one of
  the drawers in my desk, and this I found scattered on the floor&mdash;all of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "they overlooked this gold, and there was nothing else in
  the apartment anybody would wish."</p>

  <p>"They must have been frightened away before they could gather this up,"
  said Lotar Canl.</p>

  <p>The little game that he and I were playing was almost laughable for
  neither of us dared suggest the truth&mdash;that the apartment had been
  searched by the police.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said, "that you had nothing of value here other than this
  gold."</p>

  <p>When I met Sagra the next day, I said nothing about the matter to her, for
  I had learned that no matter how often one's home is "burglarized" or even if
  his grandmother is taken at midnight and beheaded, he does not mention the
  occurrence to anyone; but Sagra was less reticent. She told me that she was
  being constantly watched; that her room had been searched three times, and
  that she was terrified. "I have a secret enemy," she said, "who is leaving no
  stone unturned to get me destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea who it is?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I think I know."</p>

  <p>"Gimmel Gora?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and then she whispered, "And you must be careful of Grunge. He
  thinks that you are my man, and he would like to get rid of you."</p>

  <p>There had never been any suggestion of any sentimental relationship
  between Morga Sagra and me. She had used me in order to get to Kapara; and
  because we had been two strangers in a strange land, we had been constantly
  thrown together since. I know that she enjoyed my company, and I still found
  her witty and entertaining when she was not entirely preoccupied with the
  terror which now obsessed her. If ever a just retribution were being meted to
  a person, this was the instance. I was confident that Morga Sagra would have
  given her soul to have been back in Unis; and to her terror was added
  hopelessness, for she knew that she could never return.</p>

  <p>That evening we went to call on Horthal Wend and his woman, Haka Gera. She
  was a heavy minded, rather stupid woman, but evidently a good housekeeper and
  probably a good manager, which I judged Horthal Wend needed, for he was
  evidently easy-going and careless.</p>

  <p>We talked about art, literature, music, the weather, and the wonders of
  Kapar ideology&mdash;about the only safe subject for discussion in Kapara;
  and even then we had to be careful. If one should by mistake express
  appreciation of some work of art or musical composition by a person in bad
  odor with the heads of the state or with the Zabo, that was treason.</p>

  <p>During the evening, their fourteen year old son, Horthal Gyl, joined us.
  He was a precocious child, and I do not like precocious children. He was a
  loudmouthed little egotist who knew it all, and he kept projecting himself
  into the conversation until he practically monopolized it.</p>

  <p>Horthal Wend was evidently very proud of him and very fond of him; but
  once when he made a gesture as though to caress the lad, the boy struck his
  hand away.</p>

  <p>"None of that!" he growled at his father; "such maudlin sentimentality is
  not for Kapar men. I am ashamed of you."</p>

  <p>"Now, now," said his mother gently; "it is not wrong for your father to
  love you."</p>

  <p>"I do not wish him to love me," snapped the boy. "I only wish that he
  should admire me and be proud of me because I am hard. I do not want him or
  anyone to be as ashamed of me as I am of him because of his sentimentality
  and softness."</p>

  <p>Horthal Wend tried to smile as he shook his head. "You see, he is a good
  Kapar," he said; and, I thought, a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"I see," I said.</p>

  <p>The boy shot me a quick suspicious look. Evidently I had not kept my
  innermost feelings out of those two words.</p>

  <p>We left shortly after this and as we walked home, I was conscious of a
  feeling of great depression. I think it was caused by the attitude of that
  son to his father. "Horthal Gyl will grow up to be a fine example of the
  Kapar gentlemen," I said.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not discuss him," replied Sagra.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-7"
     id="chap2-7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I went to bed immediately after reaching my apartment. Lotar
  Canl had asked for the entire night off; so when I was awakened shortly after
  midnight by a summons at my door, I had to answer it myself. As I opened it,
  two green-clad Zabo troopers stepped in with drawn pistols.</p>

  <p>"Dress and come with us," said one of them.</p>

  <p>"There must be some mistake," I said; "I am Korvan Don, you can't want
  me."</p>

  <p>"Shut up and get dressed," said the one who had first spoken, "or we'll
  take you along in your nightclothes."</p>

  <p>While I was dressing, I racked my brains trying to think what I had done
  to deserve arrest. Of course I knew it would be useless to ask these men.
  Even if they knew, which they probably did not, they wouldn't tell me.
  Naturally I thought of Grunge, because of what Morga Sagra had told me, but
  the man could not possibly have had anything to report against me; although,
  of course, he could have fabricated some story.</p>

  <p>I was taken directly to Gurrul's office; and although it was well after
  midnight, he was still there. He gave me one of his most terrible looks and
  then screamed at me, "So you slipped at last, you filthy spy. I have always
  suspected you, and I am always right."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," I said. "You can have
  absolutely no charge against me; because I have spoken no treasonable words
  since I came to Kapara. I defy anyone to prove that I am not as good a Kapar
  as you."</p>

  <p>"Oh," he barked, "so you haven't said anything treasonable? Well, you
  idiot, you have written it." And he took a small red book from a drawer in
  his desk and held it up in front of me and shook it in my face. "Your diary,
  you fool." He turned the leaves and scanned the pages for a moment and then
  he read, "'Gurrul is a fat idiot'; so I am a fat idiot, am I?" He turned a
  few more pages, and read again. "'The Zabo is made up of moronic murderers;
  and when our revolution succeeds, I shall have them all beheaded. I shall
  behead Gurrul myself.' What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"I say that I never saw that book before and that I never wrote any of the
  things which you have read."</p>

  <p>He turned over some more pages and read again, "The Pom Da is an
  egotistical maniac and will be one of the first to be destroyed when J and I
  rule Kapara. Who is J?" he bellowed at me.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea," I told him.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are ways of making you find out," he said, and getting up and
  coming around the end of his desk, he knocked me down before I had the
  slightest idea what his intentions were.</p>

  <p>I leaped to my feet with the intention of handing him what he had handed
  me, but several troopers seized me. "Secure his hands," ordered Gurrul, and
  they put them behind my back and snapped handcuffs about my wrists.</p>

  <p>"You'd better tell me who J is," said Gurrul, "or you'll get a great deal
  worse than what I just gave you. Who is this accomplice of yours? It will go
  easier with you if you tell me."</p>

  <p>"I do not know who J is," I said.</p>

  <p>"Take him into the question box," ordered Gurrul, and they took me into an
  adjoining room which I instantly saw was fitted up as a torture chamber. They
  let me look around the room for a moment at the various instruments of
  torture, and then Gurrul started demanding again that I tell him who J was.
  He kept striking me repeatedly, and when I fell he kicked me.</p>

  <p>When I still insisted that I didn't know, one of them burned me with a hot
  iron.</p>

  <p>"Your right eye goes next," said Gurrul; "who is J?"</p>

  <p>They worked on me for about an hour, and I was pretty nearly dead when
  they finally gave up.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Gurrul, "I can't spend all the rest of the night with this
  stubborn fool; take him downstairs and behead him&mdash;unless in the
  meantime he tells you who J is."</p>

  <p>Well, this was the end of my mission. I had learned absolutely nothing,
  and now I was to be beheaded. As a spy I was evidently a total failure. A
  couple of them jerked me roughly to my feet; for I could not rise by myself,
  and just then the door opened and Lotar Canl entered the room. When I saw
  him, my suspicions were confirmed, as I had always thought that he was
  probably a Zabo agent; and now I thought that it was probably he who had
  turned this forged diary over to them, probably in the hope of winning
  preferment by discovering this plot against the nation.</p>

  <p>He took in the scene in a quick glance and then he turned to Gurrul. "Why
  is this man here?"</p>

  <p>"He is a traitor who was conspiring against Kapara," replied Gurrul. "We
  found the evidence of his guilt in this diary in his desk."</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," said Lotar Canl, "when I came home earlier than I
  expected tonight and found that the book had been removed from his desk."</p>

  <p>"You knew about this book," demanded Gurrul.</p>

  <p>"Of course," replied Lotar Canl. "I saw it planted there. Korvan Don knew
  nothing about it. I have watched this man most carefully since he has been
  here. He is as good a Kapar as any of us."</p>

  <p>Gurrul looked a little sheepish, that is if a wolf can look sheepish. "Who
  put the book in his desk?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The man who actually placed it there was an innocent tool," replied Lotar
  Canl. "I have him under arrest. He is in the next room under guard. I wish
  that you would question him yourself."</p>

  <p>The man was brought in, and Gurrul showed him the diary and asked him if
  he had placed it in my desk.</p>

  <p>The poor fellow was trembling so that he could scarcely speak, but finally
  he managed to say, "Yes, Most High."</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it?" demanded Gurrul.</p>

  <p>"The night before last, a man came into my room shortly after midnight. He
  flashed a tiny light on a Zabo badge he wore, but he was careful not to shine
  it on his face. He told me that I had been selected to place this book in
  Korvan Don's desk. He said that it was a command from you, Most High."</p>

  <p>Gurrul called Lotar Canl to the far end of the room, and they whispered
  together for several minutes; then Gurrul came back. "You may go," he said to
  the man, "but understand that nobody ever came to your room in the middle of
  the night and asked you to put anything in anybody's desk; you were not
  brought here tonight; you did not see me nor anyone else who is in this room.
  Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Most High," replied the man.</p>

  <p>"Take him away and see that he is returned to his home," Gurrul directed
  the two agents who had brought the fellow in; then he turned again to me.
  "Mistakes are bound to occur occasionally," he said. "It is regrettable, but
  it is so. Have you any idea who might have had that book placed in your
  desk?"</p>

  <p>I thought that it was Grunge, but I said, "I haven't any idea; as far as I
  know I haven't an enemy in Kapara. There is no reason why anyone should wish
  to get me into trouble." I suspected that Grunge was a Zabo agent, and I knew
  that if he were I would probably get myself into trouble by accusing him.
  Gurrul turned to one of his officers. "Have this man taken to a hospital," he
  said, "and see that he receives the best of treatment;" and then he turned to
  me. "You are never to mention this unfortunate occurrence to anyone. While
  returning home, you were knocked down and run over. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>I told him that I did; and then they sent for a stretcher, and I was
  carried out and taken to a hospital.</p>

  <p>The next day, Sagra came to see me. She said that she had found a note
  under her door telling her that I had been in an accident and what hospital I
  was in.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "I was hit by an automobile."</p>

  <p>She looked frightened. "Do you think that you will be hit again?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I hope not by the same automobile," I said.</p>

  <p>"I am terribly frightened," she said; "I am afraid that it will be my turn
  next."</p>

  <p>"Keep out of the way of automobiles," I advised her.</p>

  <p>"Gimmel Gora won't speak to me any more, and Grunge won't leave me alone.
  He told me not to be afraid, as he is a Zabo agent."</p>

  <p>"Just as I thought," I said, "and a hit and run driver too."</p>

  <p>"I wish I were back in Orvis," she said.</p>

  <p>"Be careful what you say, Sagra," I advised.</p>

  <p>She looked at me with wide, frightened eyes. "You, too?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, not I," I assured her; "but the walls may have ears."</p>

  <p>"I wish you could tell me what happened," she said.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "I have told you&mdash;I was hit by an automobile and run
  over."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are right," she said; "and I also suppose that I have
  talked altogether too much; but I am nearly crazy, and if I didn't have
  someone to tell my fears too, I think I should go crazy."</p>

  <p>Treason is a terrible thing, and its punishment must be terrible.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap2-8"
     id="chap2-8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I was in the hospital for about two weeks; but at last I was
  discharged and allowed to go home, although I had to remain in bed there most
  of the time. I found a new man there to take Lotar Canl's place. He had
  brought a note from Lotar Canl saying that he knew that I would need someone
  as soon as I returned from the hospital and that he could highly recommend
  this man, whose name was Danul.</p>

  <p>Lotar Canl came to see me himself the day after I was returned from the
  hospital. While we were talking, he wrote something on a piece of paper and
  handed it to me. It read, "Danul is not connected with the Zabo, but he is a
  good Kapar;" then, after I had read it, he took the paper from me and burned
  it up; but he was very careful to see that Danul was not around to observe
  what he did.</p>

  <p>It is terrible to live under this constant strain of fear and suspicion,
  and it shows in the faces of most of these people. Lotar Canl was peculiarly
  free from it, and I always enjoyed talking with him; however, we were both
  careful never to touch on any forbidden subjects.</p>

  <p>While I was in Ergos, there was scarcely a day passed that I did not hear
  the detonation of Unisan bombs; and I could visualize my comrades in arms
  flying high over this buried city. The only reports that I ever heard of
  these activities always related Kapar victories; or the great number of enemy
  planes shot down, and the very small losses suffered by the Kapars, or they
  would tell of the terrific bombing of Orvis or of other Unisan cities.
  According to these official reports, Kapara was just on the verge of winning
  the war.</p>

  <p>Harkas Yamoda was much in my mind at this time, and thoughts of her and my
  other friends in Orvis rather depressed me, because I felt that I couldn't
  return until I had fulfilled my mission, and I seemed to be as far as ever
  from that. No matter how often I brought up the subject of my invention, no
  one ever indicated that he had heard of such a thing. It was very
  disheartening, as the first step to acquiring any information about the new
  amplifier was to learn who was working on it; and of course I didn't dare
  suggest in the slightest way that I had knowledge that any such thing was
  being considered in Kapara.</p>

  <p>Sagra came to see me every day and spent a great deal of time with me, and
  one day Grunge came. "I was very sorry to hear of your accident," he said;
  "and I intended to come and see you sooner, but I have been very busy. There
  are many careless drivers in Ergos; one cannot be too careful."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," I said, "perhaps it was my fault; I was probably careless in
  crossing the street."</p>

  <p>"One cannot be too careful," he said again.</p>

  <p>"I have found that out," I replied; "even a friend might run over
  one."</p>

  <p>He gave me a quick look. He did not stay very long, and it was evident
  that he was nervous and ill at ease while he was there. I was glad when he
  left, for the more I saw of the man the less I liked him.</p>

  <p>Horthal Wend and his woman and son came on another day while Sagra was
  there. Horthal Wend said that he had only just heard of my accident and was
  greatly distressed to think that he had not known of it before and come to
  see me earlier. He did not question me as to the cause of it, but Horthal Gyl
  did.</p>

  <p>"I was hit by an automobile, knocked down and run over," I told him. He
  gave a knowing look and started to say something, but his father interrupted
  him. "Gyl has just made his mother and me very proud," he said; "he stood at
  the head of his class for the year," and he looked adoringly at the boy.</p>

  <p>"What are you studying?" I asked, in order to be polite and not that I
  gave a continental hang what he was studying.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose a Kapar man studies?" he demanded impudently.
  "War."</p>

  <p>"How interesting," I commented.</p>

  <p>"But that is not all I study," he continued. "However, what else I study
  is the business only of my instructor and myself."</p>

  <p>"And you expect to be a fighter when you grow up, I suppose," I said, for
  I saw that it pleased Horthal Wend that I should be taking an interest in his
  son.</p>

  <p>"When I grow up, I'm going to be a Zabo agent," said the boy; "I am always
  practicing."</p>

  <p>"How do you practice for that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't show too much curiosity about the Zabo," he warned; "it is not
  healthful."</p>

  <p>I laughed at him and told him that I was only politely interested in the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"I have warned you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Don't be impolite, son," Horthal Wend admonished him.</p>

  <p>"If I were you," he retorted, "I wouldn't interfere with the Zabo; and you
  should be more careful with whom you associate," and he cast a dark look at
  Sagra. "The Zabo sees all; knows all." I should have liked to have choked the
  impossible little brat. Sagra looked uncomfortable and Horthal Wend
  fidgeted.</p>

  <p>Finally he said, "Oh, stop talking about the Zabo, son; it's bad enough to
  have it without talking about it all the time."</p>

  <p>The boy shot him a dirty look. "You are speaking treason," he said to his
  father.</p>

  <p>"Now, Gyl," said his mother, "I wouldn't say things like that."</p>

  <p>I could see that Horthal Wend was getting more and more nervous, and
  presently he got up and they took their leave.</p>

  <p>"Somebody ought to give that brat rat poison," I said to Sagra.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "He is dangerous," she whispered. "He hangs around Grunge's
  home a great deal and is very friendly with both Grunge and Gimmel Gora. I
  think it is through Gimmel Gora that he has come to suspect me; did you see
  how he looked at me when he told his father that he should be more careful
  with whom he associated?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "I noticed; but I wouldn't worry about him, he is only a
  little boy practicing at being a detective."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, he is a very dangerous little boy," she said. "A great deal
  of the information that the Zabo receives comes from children."</p>

  <p>A couple of days later I went out for my first walk; and as Horthal Wend
  lived only a short distance from my apartment, I went over to call on
  him.</p>

  <p>Haka Gera, his woman, opened the door for me. She was in tears, and the
  boy was sitting, sullen and scowling, in the corner. I sensed that something
  terrible had happened, but I was afraid to ask. At last, between sobs, Haka
  Gera said, "You came to see Wend?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied; "is he at home?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and then burst into a violent spasm of sobbing. The boy
  sat there and glowered at her. Finally she gained control of herself and
  whispered, "They came last night and took him away." She looked over at the
  boy, and there was fear in her eyes&mdash;fear and horror and reproach.</p>

  <p>I did my best to comfort her; but it was hopeless, and finally I took my
  departure. As far as I know, Horthal Wend was never seen nor heard of
  again.</p>

  <p>I am not a drinking man; but as I walked back toward my apartment, I was
  so depressed and almost nauseated by the whole affair that I went into a
  drinking place and ordered a glass of wine. There were only two other
  customers in the place as I seated myself at a little table. They had the
  hard, cruel faces of Kapar fighting men or police. I could see that they were
  scrutinizing me closely and whispering to one another. Finally they got up
  and came over and stopped in front of me.</p>

  <p>"Your credentials," barked one of them.</p>

  <p>My wine permit was lying on the table in front of me, and I pushed it over
  toward him. It bore my name and address and a brief description. He picked it
  up and looked at it and then threw it down on the table angrily. "I said your
  credentials," he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Let me see yours," I said; "I have the right to know upon what authority
  you question a law-abiding citizen." I was right in my demand, although
  possibly a little foolish in insisting upon my rights. The fellow grumbled
  and showed me a Zabo badge, and then I handed him my credentials.</p>

  <p>He looked them over carefully and then handed them back. "So you're the
  fellow who was run over by an automobile a few weeks ago," he said; "well, if
  I were you, I'd be more respectful to Zabo officers, or you may be run over
  again;" and then they turned and stamped out of the place. It was such things
  as this that made life in Ergos what it was.</p>

  <p>When I got home, Danul told me that two Zabo agents had been there and
  searched my apartment. I don't know why he told me; because he really had no
  business to, unless he had been given orders to do so for the purpose of
  trapping me into some treasonable expression, for it is treason to express
  any disapproval of an act of the Zabo; I could have been drawn and quartered
  for what I was thinking of them though.</p>

  <p>Now I commenced to be suspicious of Danul, and I wondered if Lotar Canl
  had lied to me or if this man was an agent without Lotar Canl having any
  knowledge of the fact. Insofar as suspicion was concerned, I was becoming a
  true Kapar; I suspected everybody. I think the only man whom I had ever met
  here that I had perfect confidence in was Horthal Wend, and they had come at
  night and taken him away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2-9"
     id="chap2-9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Morga Sagra came in shortly after I returned; and I sent
  Danul out on an errand, so that I might tell her about Horthal Wend.</p>

  <p>"That horrible child!" she exclaimed. "Oh, Tangor!" she cried, "can't we
  get out of here?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ever speak that name again," I said. "Do you want to get me into
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry; it just came out. Couldn't we get away somehow?"</p>

  <p>"And be shot as soon as we return to Orvis?" I said. "You got yourself
  into this," I reminded her, "and now you've got to grin and bear it and so
  have I; although I really enjoy it here," I lied. "I wouldn't go back to
  Orvis under any circumstances."</p>

  <p>She looked at me questioningly. "I'm sorry," she said. "You won't hold it
  against me, will you? Oh, Korvan Don, you won't tell anybody that I said
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," I assured her.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it," she said, "I can't help it. I am almost a nervous
  wreck. I have a premonition that something terrible is going to happen," and
  just then there came a pounding on the door, and I thought that Morga Sagra
  was going to faint.</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together and buck up," I said, as I crossed to the door. As
  I opened it, I was confronted by two high officers of the Kapar fighting
  force.</p>

  <p>"You are Korvan Don?" inquired one of them.</p>

  <p>"I am," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You will come with us," he said.</p>

  <p>Well, at least they were not agents of the Zabo; but what they wanted of
  me I couldn't imagine; and, of course, I did not ask. Since I have been here
  in Ergos, I have schooled myself to such an extent that I even hesitate to
  ask the time of day. We were driven at high speed, through crowded streets,
  to the building in which is the office of the Pom Da, and, after but a
  moment's wait in an ante-room, I was ushered into the presence of the Great
  I.</p>

  <p>The Pom Da came to the point immediately. "When you were here before," he
  said, "you told me that before you left that other world from which you say
  you came, you were working on a ship which you believed would have a radius
  of something like 48,000,000 miles. One of our foremost inventors has been
  working along similar lines, and had almost perfected a power amplifier which
  would make it possible for a ship to fly from Poloda to other planets of our
  solar system; but unfortunately he recently suffered an accident and
  died.</p>

  <p>"Naturally this important work was carried on with the utmost secrecy. He
  had no assistants; nobody but he could complete the experimental amplifier
  upon which he was working. It must be completed."</p>

  <p>"I have had excellent reports of your integrity and loyalty since you have
  been here. I have sent for you because I believe you are the man best fitted
  to carry on from where our late inventor left off. It is, naturally, a very
  important piece of work, the details of which must be guarded carefully lest
  they fall into the hands of our enemy, who treacherously maintains agents
  among us. I have convinced myself that you are to be trusted, and I am never
  wrong in my estimate of men. You will therefore proceed to the laboratory and
  workshop where the amplifier was being built and complete it."</p>

  <p>"Is it a command, Highest Most High?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall do my best," I said, "but it is a responsibility I should
  not have chosen voluntarily, and I cannot have but wished that you might have
  found someone better fitted than I for so important a commission." I wished
  to give him the impression that I was reluctant to work upon the amplifier,
  for fear that I might otherwise reveal my elation. After weeks of failure and
  disappointment, and without the faintest ray of hope of ever succeeding in my
  mission, the solution of my problem was now being dumped into my lap by the
  highest Kapar in the land.</p>

  <p>The Great I, who was such a marvelous judge of men, gave me a few general
  instructions and then ordered that I be taken at once to the laboratory, and
  I backed out of his presence with the two officers who had brought me. I
  thought that I understood now, why I had been watched so closely, and why my
  apartment had been ransacked so frequently.</p>

  <p>As I drove through the streets of Ergos, I was happy for the first time
  since I had left Orvis; and I was rather pleased with myself too, for I felt
  confident that my oft-repeated references to the imaginary ship that I had
  been supposed to have been working on, on Earth had finally born fruit. Of
  course, I had never been working on any such ship as I described; but I had
  done considerable experimental work on airplane motors, and I hoped that this
  would help me in my present undertaking.</p>

  <p>I was driven to a neighborhood with which I was very familiar and was
  taken to a laboratory behind a home in which I had been entertained&mdash;the
  home of Horthal Wend.</p>

  <p>I spent a full week studying the plans and examining the small model and
  the experimental amplifier that was almost completed. Horthal Wend had kept
  voluminous notes, and from these I discovered that he had eliminated all the
  bugs but one. As I worked, I was occasionally aware of being watched; and a
  couple of times I caught a fleeting glimpse of a face at the window. But
  whether the Pom Da was having me watched or someone was awaiting an
  opportunity to steal the plans, I did not know.</p>

  <p>The trouble with Horthal Wend's amplifier was that it diffused instead of
  concentrating the energy derived from the sun, so that, while I was confident
  that it would propel a ship to either of the nearer planets, the speed would
  diminish progressively as the distance from the central power station on
  Poloda increased, with the result that the time consumed in covering the
  600,000 miles between the two planets would be so great as to render the
  invention useless from any practical standpoint.</p>

  <p>On the day that I eliminated the last bug and felt sure that I had an
  amplifier capable of powering the ship to almost any distance from Poloda, I
  caught a glimpse of that face at the window again, and decided to try to find
  out who it was who was so inquisitive about my work.</p>

  <p>Pretending that I had noticed nothing, I busied myself about the room,
  keeping my back toward the window as much as possible, until I finally
  reached the door that was near the window; then I threw the door open and
  stepped out. There was Horthal Gyl, very red in the face and looking very
  foolish.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" I demanded; "practicing again, or trying to pry
  into government secrets?"</p>

  <p>Horthal Gyl got hold of himself in a hurry; the brat had the brazen
  effrontery of a skunk on a narrow trail. "What I am doing here is none of
  your business," he said impudently. "There may be those who trust you, but I
  don't."</p>

  <p>"Whether you trust me or not, is of no interest to me," I said, "but if I
  ever catch you here again, I am going to give you all of the beatings in one
  that your father should have given you." He gave me one of his foul looks and
  turned and walked away.</p>

  <p>The next day I asked for an interview with the Pom Da, who granted it
  immediately. The officers who came for me and those whom I encountered on my
  way to the office of the Great I were most obsequious; I was getting places
  in Kapara in a big way. Any man who spent a full week studying the plans and
  examining the small model and could ask for an audience with the Pom Da and
  get it immediately was a man to know.</p>

  <p>"How is the work progressing?" he asked me as I stopped before his
  desk.</p>

  <p>"Excellently," I replied. "I am sure that I can perfect the amplifier if
  you will place a plane at my disposal for experimental purposes."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "What type of plane do you wish?"</p>

  <p>"The fastest scout plane you have," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want a fast plane," he demanded, instantly suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Because it is the type of plane that will have to be used for the first
  experimental flight to another planet," I replied.</p>

  <p>He nodded and beckoned to one of his aides. "Have a fast scout plane
  placed at Korvan Don's disposal," he ordered, "and issue instructions that he
  is to be permitted to fly at any time at his discretion." I was so elated
  that I could have hugged even the Pom Da; and then he added, "but give orders
  that a flying officer must always accompany him." My bubble was burst.</p>

  <p>I made several experimental flights; and I always took along all the
  plans, drawings, and the model. I took them quite openly, and I kept
  referring to Horthal Wend's notes, to the drawings, and to the model during
  the flight, giving the impression that I had to have them all with me in
  order to check the performance of the amplifier on the ship, as well as to
  prevent theft of them while I was away from the laboratory.</p>

  <p>The same officer never accompanied me twice, a fact which eventually had
  considerable bearing upon the performance of my mission. If these fellows
  could have known what was in my mind all the time they were sitting in the
  ship beside me, they would have been surprised; I was trying to think of some
  way in which I could kill them, for only by getting rid of them could I
  escape from Kapara.</p>

  <p>The amplifier was an unqualified success; I was positive that it would fly
  the ship to any part of the solar system, but I didn't tell anybody so. I
  still insisted that a few experimental changes would have to be made, and so
  the time dragged on while I awaited an opportunity to kill the officer who
  accompanied me. The fact that they had never given me any weapons made this
  difficult.</p>

  <p>I had not dared to ask for weapons; one does not go at anything of that
  kind directly, but I had tried to suggest that I should be armed by telling
  the Pom Da that I had seen someone looking in my laboratory window on several
  occasions. All that got me was a heavy guard of Zabo agents around the
  laboratory building.</p>

  <p>Since I had been working on the amplifier, I had seen practically nothing
  of Morga Sagra, as I had slept in the laboratory and had only returned to my
  apartment occasionally for a change of clothing. After I commenced to fly, I
  occasionally went directly to my apartment from the hangar, taking the plans
  and the model with me; but I never went out on those nights as I did not dare
  leave the things in my apartment unguarded.</p>

  <p>Danul cooked and served my meals, and Morga Sagra ate with me
  occasionally. She told me that she had seen Horthal Gyl with Gimmel Gora on
  several occasions recently, and that Grunge had left his woman and was living
  in another part of the city. Morga Sagra hadn't seen him for some time now,
  and she was commencing to feel much safer.</p>

  <p>Things seemed to be going along beautifully about this time and then the
  blow fell&mdash;Morga Sagra was arrested.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Insofar as I was concerned, the worst feature of Morga
  Sagra's arrest was that when they came for her, they found her in my
  apartment. Of course I didn't have any idea what the charge against her might
  be; but, if she were suspected of anything, those who associated closely with
  her, would be under suspicion too.</p>

  <p>She was taken away at what would be about seven o'clock in the evening
  Earth time, and about ten, Lotar Canl came. He was dressed in the uniform of
  an officer of the flying force. It was the first time that I had ever seen
  him in anything but civilian clothes; and I was a little, surprised, but I
  asked no questions.</p>

  <p>He came and sat down close to me. "Are you alone?" he asked in a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said; "I let Danul go out after dinner."</p>

  <p>"I have some very bad news for you," he said. "I have just come from the
  question box in Zabo headquarters. They had Morga Sagra there. That little
  devil, Horthal Gyl, was there too; it was he who had accused her of being a
  Unisan spy. A very close friend of mine, in the Zabo, told me that he had
  also accused you, and he had reported that I was very intimate with you and
  with Morga Sagra also. They tortured her to make her confess that she was a
  Unisan spy and that you were also."</p>

  <p>"She never admitted that she was anything but a good Kapar, but in order
  to save herself from further torture, she told them that you were, just
  before she died."</p>

  <p>"So what?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You have access to a ship whenever you want one. You must escape and that
  immediately for they will be here for you before midnight."</p>

  <p>"But I can't take a ship out unless an officer accompanies me," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"I know that," he replied; "that is the reason for this uniform. I am
  going with you."</p>

  <p>I was instantly suspicious that this might be a trap, for, if I acted on
  his suggestion and tried to escape, I would be admitting my guilt. I knew
  that Lotar Canl was an agent of the Zabo, but I had liked him and I had
  always felt that I could trust him. He saw that I was hesitating.</p>

  <p>"You can trust me," he said. "I am not a Kapar."</p>

  <p>I looked at him in surprise. "Not a Kapar?" I demanded, "what are you
  then?"</p>

  <p>"The same thing you are, Tangor," he replied&mdash;"a Unisan secret agent.
  I have been here for over ten years, but now that I am under suspicion, my
  usefulness is at an end. I was advised of your coming and told to look after
  you. I also knew that Morga Sagra was a traitor. She got what she deserved,
  but it was a horrible thing to see."</p>

  <p>The fact that he knew my name and that he knew that I was an agent and
  Morga Sagra a traitor convinced me that he had spoken the truth.</p>

  <p>"I'll be with you in just a moment," I said; then I got all the plans,
  drawings, and notes covering the amplifier and burned them, and while they
  were burning, I smashed the model so that not a single part of it was
  recognizable.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?" demanded Lotar Canl.</p>

  <p>"I don't want these things to fall into Kapar hands if we are caught," I
  said; "and I could reproduce that amplifier with my eyes shut; furthermore,
  there is a perfectly good one on the ship we will fly away."</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that I had insisted upon having a fast scout plane,
  for while we were taxiing up the ramp to take off, an officer shouted at me
  to return; and then the alarm sounded, rising above the rapid fire of a
  machine gun, as bullets whistled about us.</p>

  <p>Ships shot from half a dozen ramps in pursuit, but they never overtook
  us.</p>

  <p>We flew first to Pud and got a change of clothing and the old Karisan
  plane from Frink, and then on to Gorvas where my knowledge of Gompth's name
  came in handy. Lotar Canl showed him his Zabo credentials, and we got a
  change of clothing and my ship. I had taken the amplifier off the Kapar plane
  at Pud, and when we reached Orvis, I took it immediately to the Eljanhai, who
  congratulated me on having so successfully fulfilled a difficult mission.</p>

  <p>Just as soon as I could get away from the Eljanhai and the Commissioner
  for War, I made a bee-line for the Harkases. The prospect of seeing them
  again made me even happier than had the successful fulfillment of my mission.
  Don and Yamoda were in the garden when I entered, and when Yamoda saw me, she
  jumped up and ran into the house. Don confronted me with a face.</p>

  <p>I had been so filled with happiness at the prospect of seeing them, the
  shock of this greeting stunned me and kept me speechless for a moment, and
  then my pride prevented me from asking for an explanation. I turned on my
  heel and left. Blue and despondent, I went back to my old quarters. What had
  happened? What had I done to deserve such treatment from my best friends. I
  couldn't understand it, but I had been so terribly hurt that I would not go
  and ask for an explanation.</p>

  <p>I took up my old duties in the flying corps immediately. Never in my life
  had I flown so recklessly. I invited death on every possible occasion, but I
  seemed to bear a charmed life; and then, one day, the Eljanhai sent for
  me.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to give the amplifier a serious test?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I certainly would," I replied.</p>

  <p>"What do you think would be the best plan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I will fly to Tonos," I replied.</p>

  <p>He did some figuring on a pad of paper and then said, "That will take
  between thirty-five and forty days. It will be very dangerous. Do you realize
  the risk?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"I shall ask for volunteers to go with you," he said.</p>

  <p>"I prefer to go alone, sir; there is no use in risking more than one life.
  I have no ties here. It would not mean anything to anyone in a personal way,
  if I never return."</p>

  <p>"I thought that you had some very close friends here," he said.</p>

  <p>"So did I, but I was mistaken. I'd really prefer to go alone."</p>

  <p>"When do you wish to start?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I can provision my ship; I shall need a great quantity of food
  and water; much more than enough for a round trip. There's no telling what
  conditions are like on Tonos. I may not be able to obtain any food or even
  water there as far as anyone knows."</p>

  <p>"Requisition all that you require," he said, "and come and see me again
  before you take off."</p>

  <p>By the following night, I had everything that I needed carefully stowed in
  my ship, which was equipped with a robot pilot, as were all the great radius
  ships in Poloda. I could set the robot and sleep all the way to Tonos if I
  wished; that is, if I could sleep that long.</p>

  <p>I was so intrigued with the prospect of this adventure that I was almost
  happy while I was actively employed, but when I returned to my quarters that
  last night, possibly and probably my last night on Poloda, my depression
  returned. I could think of nothing but the reception that Yamoda and Don had
  given me. My best friends! I tell you, try as I would, I couldn't keep the
  tears from coming to my eyes as I thought about it.</p>

  <p>I was just about ready to peel off my uniform and turn in when there was a
  knock at my door. "Come in!" I said.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and an officer entered. At first I did not recognize him,
  he had changed so since I had last seen him. It was Handon Gar.</p>

  <p>"So you did escape," I said "I am glad."</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment in silence looking at me. "I don't know what to
  say," he said. "I did you a terrible wrong, and only today did I learn the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I thought that you were a traitor, and so reported when I returned to
  Orvis. When you came back and they didn't arrest you, I was dumbfounded; but
  I figured that they were giving you more rope with which to hang
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Then it was you who told Harkas Yamoda?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "and that was the worst wrong I committed, for I hurt her
  and Don as much as I did you; but I have been to them and told them the
  truth. I have just come from them, and they want you to come to their home
  tonight.</p>

  <p>"How did you learn the truth?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The Commissioner for War told me today. He was surprised to know that you
  had not told anyone."</p>

  <p>"I had not received permission; I was still nominally a secret agent."</p>

  <p>When I got to the Harkases, none of us could speak for several moments;
  but finally Don and Yamoda controlled their emotions sufficiently to ask my
  forgiveness, Yamoda with tears running down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>We talked for some time, as they wanted to know all about my experiences
  in Kapara, and then Don and Handon Gar went into the house, leaving Yamoda
  and me alone.</p>

  <p>We sat in silence for several moments, and then Yamoda said, "Morga Sagra;
  was she very beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly truthful, I couldn't say," I replied. "I suppose she was
  good-looking enough, but my mind was usually filled with so many other things
  that I didn't give much thought to Morga Sagra except as a fellow
  conspirator. I knew she was a traitor, and no traitor could look beautiful to
  me. Then too I carried with me the memory of someone far more beautiful."</p>

  <p>She gave me a quick half-glance, a little questioning look, as though to
  ask whom that might be; but I didn't have a chance to tell her, for just then
  Handon Gar and Don came back into the garden and interrupted our
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"What's this I hear of the expedition you're setting out on tomorrow?"
  demanded Don.</p>

  <p>"What expedition?" asked Yamoda.</p>

  <p>"He's going to try to fly to Tonos."</p>

  <p>"You're joking," said Yamoda.</p>

  <p>"Am I, Tangor?" demanded Don.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "He's not joking." Then I told them of the amplifier I
  had perfected and that the Eljanhai had given me permission to make the
  flight.</p>

  <p>"Not alone, Tangor!" cried Yamoda.</p>

  <p>"Yes, alone," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please, if you must go, have somebody with you," she begged; "but
  must you go?"</p>

  <p>"My ship is outfitted, and I leave tomorrow morning," I replied.</p>

  <p>Handon Gar begged to go with me. He said that he had permission from the
  Commissioner for War, if I wished to take him along. Don said he'd like to
  go, but couldn't as he had another assignment.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any reason for risking more than one life," I said, but
  Yamoda begged me to take Handon Gar along, and he pleaded so eloquently that
  at last I consented.</p>

  <p>That night as I left, I kissed little Yamoda goodbye. It was the first
  time that we had ever kissed. Until then, she had seemed like a beloved
  sister to me; now somehow, she seemed different.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow Handon Gar and I take off for Tonos, over 570,000 miles
  away.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><i>Editor's note</i>: I wonder if Tangor ever reached that
  little planet winging its way around a strange sun, 450,000 light years away.
  I wonder if I shall ever know.</p>
