  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">THE lone horseman rode slowly up the slope, bending far down
  from his saddle in the posture customary for a range rider when studying hoof
  tracks. The intensity of his scrutiny indicated far more than the depth or
  direction of these imprints in the dust.</p>

  <p>Presently the rider sat up and turned in his saddle to look back. While
  pondering the situation, his eagle eyes swept the far country below. It was a
  scene like hundreds of others limned upon his memory&mdash;a vast and rugged
  section of the West, differing only in the elements of color, beauty,
  distance and grandeur that characterized the green Salmon River Valley, the
  gray rolling range beyond, the dead-white plain of alkali and the purple
  sawtoothed peaks piercing the sky in the far distance.</p>

  <p>That the tracks of the stolen Watrous thoroughbreds would lead over the
  range into Montana had been the trailer's foregone conclusion. But that the
  mysterious horse thieves had so far taken little care to conceal their tracks
  seemed a proof of how brazen this gang had become. On the other hand, Dale
  Brittenham reflected that he was a wild-horse hunter&mdash;that a trail
  invisible to most men would be like print to him.</p>

  <p>He gazed back down the long slope into Idaho, pondering his task, slowly
  realizing that he had let himself in for a serious and perhaps deadly
  job.</p>

  <p>It had taken Dale five hours to ride up to the point where he now
  straddled his horse, and the last from which he could see the valley. From
  here the stage road led north over the divide into the wild timbered
  range.</p>

  <p>The time was about noon of an early summer day. The air at that height had
  a cool sweet tang, redolent of the green pines and the flowered mountain
  meadows. Dale strongly felt the beauty and allurement of the scene, and
  likewise a presentiment of trouble. The little mining town of Salmon, in the
  heyday of its biggest gold-producing year&mdash;1886&mdash;nestled in a bend
  of the shining white-and-green river. Brittenham had many enemies down there
  and but few friends. The lonely life of a wild-horse hunter had not kept him
  from conflict with men. Whose toes might he not step upon if he tracked down
  these horse thieves? The country was infested with road agents, bandits,
  horse thieves; and the wildest era Idaho had ever known was in full
  swing.</p>

  <p>"I've long had a hunch," Dale soliloquized broodingly. "There're men down
  there, maybe as rich and respectable as Watrous himself, who're in cahoots
  with these thieves...'Cause if there wasn't, thick slick stealin' couldn't be
  done."</p>

  <p>The valley shone green and gold and purple under the bright sun, a vast
  winding range of farms, ranches, pastures, leading up to the stark Sawtooth
  Mountains, out of which the river glistened like a silver thread. It wound
  down between grassy hills to meander into the valley. Dale's gaze fastened
  upon an irregular green spot and a white house surrounded by wide sweeping
  pastures. This was the Watrous ranch. Dale watched it, conscious of a pang in
  his heart. The only friendship for a man and love of a woman he had ever
  known had come to him there. Leale Hildrith, the partner of Jim Watrous in an
  extensive horse-breeding and trading business, had once been a friend in need
  to Brittenham. But for Hildrith, the wild-horse hunter would long before have
  taken the trail of the thieves who regularly several times a year plundered
  the ranches of the valley. Watrous had lost hundreds of horses.</p>

  <p>"Dale, lay off," Hildrith had advised impatiently. "It's no mix of yours.
  It'll lead into more gunplay, and you've already got a bad name for that.
  Besides, there's no telling where such a trail might wind up."</p>

  <p>Brittenham had been influenced by the friend to whom he owed his life. Yet
  despite his loyalty, he wondered at Hildrith's attitude. It must surely be
  that Hildrith again wanted to save him from harm, and Dale warmed to the
  thought. But when, on this morning, he had discovered that five of Edith
  Waltrous's thoroughbreds, the favorite horses she loved so dearly, had been
  stolen, he said no word to anyone at the ranch and set out upon the
  trail.</p>

  <p>At length Brittenham turned his back upon the valley and rode on up the
  slope toward the timberline, now close at hand. He reached the straggling
  firs at a point where two trails branched off the road. The right one led
  along the edge of the timberline, and on it the sharp tracks of the shod
  horses showed plainly in dust.</p>

  <p>At this junction Dale dismounted to study the tracks. After a careful
  scrutiny he made the deduction that he was probably two hours behind the
  horse thieves, who were plainly lagging along. Dale found an empty whiskey
  bottle, which was still damp and strong with the fumes of liquor. This might
  in some measure account for the carelessness of the thieves.</p>

  <p>Dale rode on, staying close to the fir trees, between them and the trail,
  while he kept a keen eye ahead. On the way up he had made a number of
  conjectures, which he now discarded. This branching off the road puzzled him.
  It meant probably that the horse thieves had a secret rendezvous somewhere
  off in this direction. After perhaps an hour of travel along the timber belt,
  Dale entered a rocky region where progress was slow, and he came abruptly
  upon a wide, well-defined trail running at right angles to the one he was on.
  Hundreds of horses had passed along there, but none recently. Dale got off to
  reconnoiter. He had stumbled upon something that he had never heard the
  riders mention&mdash;a trail which wound up the mountain slope over an
  exceedingly rough route. Dale followed it until he had an appreciation of
  what a hard climb, partly on foot, riders must put themselves to, coming up
  from the valley. He realized that here was the outlet for horse thieves
  operating on the Salmon and Snake river ranges of Idaho. It did not take Dale
  long to discover that it was a one-way trail. No hoof tracks pointing
  down!</p>

  <p>"Well, here's a rummy deal!" he ejaculated. And he remembered the horse
  traders who often drove bands of Montana horses down into Idaho and sold them
  all the way to Twin Falls and Boise. Those droves of horses came down the
  stage road. Suddenly Dale arrived at an exciting conclusion. "By thunder!
  Those Montana horses are stolen, too. By the same gang&mdash;a big gang of
  slick horse thieves. They steal way down on the Montana ranges...drive up
  over a hidden trail like this to some secret place where they meet part of
  their outfit who've been stealin' in Idaho...then they switch herds...and
  they drive down, sellin' the Montana horses in Idaho and the Idaho horses in
  Montana...Well! The head of that outfit has got brains. Too many to steal Jim
  Watrous's fine blooded stock! That must have been a slip...But any rider
  would want to steal Edith Watrous's horses!"</p>

  <p>Returning to his mount, Dale led him in among the firs and rocks, keeping
  to the line of the new trail but not directly upon it. A couple of slow miles
  brought him to the divide. Beyond that the land sloped gently, the rocks and
  ridges merged into a fine open forest. His view was unobstructed for several
  hundred yards. Bands of deer bounded away from in front of Dale, to halt and
  watch with long ears erect. Dale had not hunted far over that range. He knew
  the Saw-tooth Mountains in as far as Thunder Mountain. His wild-horse
  activities had been confined to the desert and low country toward the Snake
  River. Therefore he had no idea where this trail would lead him. Somewhere
  over this divide, on the eastern slope, lived a band of Palouse Indians. Dale
  knew some of them and had hunted wild horses with them. He had befriended one
  of the number, Nalook, to the extent of saving him from a jail sentence. From
  that time Nalook had been utterly devoted to Dale, and had rendered him every
  possible service.</p>

  <p>By midafternoon Brittenham was far down on the forested tableland. He
  meant to stick to the trail as long as there was light enough to see. His
  saddlebag contained meat, biscuits, dried fruit and salt. His wild-horse
  hunts often kept him weeks on the trail, so his present pursuit presented no
  obstacles. Nevertheless, as he progressed he grew more and more wary. He
  expected to see a log cabin in some secluded spot. At length he came to a
  brook that ran down from a jumble of low bluffs and followed the trail. The
  water coursed in alternate eddies and swift runs. Beaver dams locked it up
  into little lakes. Dale found beaver cutting aspens in broad daylight, which
  attested to the wildness of the region. Far ahead he saw rocky crags and
  rough gray ridgetops. This level open forest would not last much farther.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Brittenham's horse shot up his ears and halted in his tracks. A
  shrill neigh came faintly to the rider's ears. He peered ahead through the
  pines, his nerves tingling.</p>

  <p>But Dale could not make out any color or movement, and the sound was not
  repeated. This fact somewhat allayed his fears. After a sharp survey of his
  surroundings, Dale had led his horse into a clump of small firs and haltered
  him there. Then, rifle in hand, he crept forward from tree to tree. This
  procedure was slow work, as he exercised great caution.</p>

  <p>The sun sank behind the fringe of timber on the high ground and soon
  shadows appeared in thick parts of the forest. Suddenly the ring of an ax
  sent the blood back to Dale's heart. He crouched down behind a pine and
  rested a moment, his thoughts whirling. There were campers ahead, or a cabin;
  and Dale strongly inclined to the conviction that the horse thieves had
  halted for the night. If so, it meant they were either far from their
  rendezvous or taking their time waiting for comrades to join them. Dale
  pondered the situation. He must be decisive, quick, ruthless. But he could
  not determine what to do until he saw the outfit and the lay of the land.</p>

  <p>Therefore he got up, and after a long scrutiny ahead, he slipped from
  behind the tree and stole on to another. He repeated this move. Brush and
  clumps of fir and big pines obstructed any considerable survey ahead. Finally
  he came to less thick covering on the ground. He smelled smoke. He heard
  faint indistinguishable sounds. Then a pinpoint of fire gleamed through the
  thicket in front of him. Without more ado Dale dropped on all fours and
  crawled straight for that light. When he got to the brush and peered through,
  his heart gave a great leap at the sight of Edith Watrous's horses staked out
  on a grassy spot.</p>

  <p>Then he crouched on his knees, holding the Winchester tight, trying to
  determine a course of action. Various plans flashed through his mind. The one
  he decided to be the least risky was to wait until the thieves were asleep
  and quietly make away with the horses. These thoroughbreds knew him well. He
  could release them without undue excitement. With half a night's start he
  would be far on the way back to the ranch before the thieves discovered their
  loss. The weakness of this plan lay in the possibility of a new outfit
  joining this band. That, however, would not deter Dale from making the
  attempt to get the horses.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him presently to steal up on the camp under cover of the
  darkness and if possible get close enough to see and hear the robbers. Dale
  lay debating this course and at last yielded to the temptation. Dusk settled
  down. The night hawks wheeled and uttered their guttural cries overhead. He
  waited patiently. When it grew dark he crawled around the thicket and stood
  up. A bright campfire blazed in the distance. Dark forms moved to and fro
  across the light. Off to the left of Dale's position there appeared to be
  more cover. He sheered off that way, lost sight of the campfire, threaded a
  careful approach among trees and brush, and after a long detour came up
  behind the camp, scarcely a hundred yards distant. A big pine tree dominated
  an open space lighted by the campfire. Dale selected objects to use for cover
  and again sank to his hands and knees. Well he knew that the keenest of men
  were easier to crawl upon than wild horses at rest. He was like an Indian. He
  made no more noise than a snake. At intervals he peered above the grass and
  low brush. He heard voices and now and then the sputtering of the fire. He
  rested again. His next stop would be behind a windfall that now obscured the
  camp. Drawing a deep breath, he crawled on silently without looking up. The
  grass was wet with dew.</p>

  <p>A log barred Dale's advance. He relaxed and lay quiet, straining his
  ears.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Ben, this hyar was a damn fool job," spoke up a husky-voiced
  individual. "Alec agrees with me."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I shore do," corroborated another man. "We was drunk."</p>

  <p>"Not me. I never was more clearheaded in my life," replied the third
  thief, called Ben. His reply ended with a hard chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Wal, if you was, no one noticed it," returned Alec sourly. "I reckon you
  roped us into a mess."</p>

  <p>"Aw, hell! Big Bill will yelp with joy."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe. Shore he's been growin' overbold these days. Makin' too much
  money. Stands too well in Halsey an' Bannock, an' Salmon. Cocksure no one
  will ever find our hole-up."</p>

  <p>"Bah! That wouldn't faze Big Bill Mason. He'd bluff it through."</p>

  <p>"Aha! Like Henry Plummer, eh? The coldest proposition of a robber that
  ever turned a trick. He had a hundred men in his outfit. Stole damn near a
  million in gold. High respected citizen of Montana. Mayor of Alder
  Gulch...All the same, he put his neck in the noose!"</p>

  <p>"Alec is right, Ben," spoke up the third member in his husky voice. "Big
  Bill is growin' wild. Too careless. Spends too much time in town. Gambles.
  Drinks...Someday some foxy cowboy or hors hunter will trail him. An' that'll
  be about due when Watrous finds his blooded horses gone."</p>

  <p>"Wal, what worries me more is how Hildrith will take this deal of yours,"
  said Alec. "Like as not he'll murder us."</p>

  <p>Brittenham sustained a terrible shock. It was like a physical rip of his
  flesh. Hildrith! Those horse thieves spoke familiarly of his beloved friend.
  Dale grew suddenly sick. Did not this explain Leale's impatient opposition to
  the trailing of horse thieves?</p>

  <p>"Ben, you can gamble Hildrith will be wild," went on Alec. "He's got sense
  if Big Bill hasn't. He's Watrous's pardner, mind you. Why, Jim Watrous would
  hang him."</p>

  <p>"We heard talk this time that Hildrith was goin' to marry old Jim's lass.
  What a hell of a pickle Leale will be in!"</p>

  <p>"Fellers, he'll be all the stronger if he does grab thet hoss-lovin' girl.
  But I don't believe he'll be so lucky. I seen Edith Watrous in town with that
  cowboy Les Crocker. She shore makes a feller draw his breath hard. She's
  young an' she likes the cowboys."</p>

  <p>"Wal, what of thet? If Jim wants her to marry his pardner, she'll have
  to."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe she's a chip off the old block. Anyway, I've knowed a heap of women
  an' thet's my hunch...Hildrith will be as sore as a bunged-up thumb. But what
  can he do? We got the hosses."</p>

  <p>"So we have. Five white elephants! Ben, you've let <i>your</i> cravin' for
  fine hossflesh carry you away."</p>

  <p>An interval of silence ensued, during which Dale raised himself to peer
  guardedly over the log. Two of the thieves sat with hard red faces in the
  glare of the blaze. The third had his back to Dale.</p>

  <p>"What ails <i>me</i>, now I got 'em, is can I keep 'em," this man replied.
  "Thet black is the finest hoss I ever seen."</p>

  <p>"They're all grand hosses. An' thet's all the good it'll do you," retorted
  the leaner of the other two.</p>

  <p>"Ben, them thoroughbreds air known from Deadwood to Walla Walla. They
  can't be sold or rid. An' shore as Gawd make little apples, the stealin' of
  them will bust Big Bill's gang."</p>

  <p>"Aw, you're a couple of yellow pups," rejoined Ben contemptuously. "If I'd
  known you was goin' to show like this, I'd split with you an' done the job
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Uhuh! I recollect now thet <i>you</i> did the watchin' while Steve an' me
  stole the horses. An' I sort of recollect dim-like thet you talked big about
  money while you was feedin' us red likker."</p>

  <p>"Yep, I did&mdash;an' I had to get you drunk. Haw! Haw!"</p>

  <p>"On purpose? Made us trick the outfit an' switch to your job, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, on purpose."</p>

  <p>"So...How you like this on purpose, Ben?" hissed Alec, and swift as a
  flash he whipped out a gun. Ben's hoarse yell of protest died in his throat
  with the bang of the big Colt.</p>

  <p>The bullet went clear through the man to strike the log uncomfortably near
  Dale. He ducked instinctively, then sank down again, tense and cold.</p>

  <p>"My Gawd! Alec, you bored him," burst out the man Steve.</p>

  <p>"I shore did. The damn bullhead!...An' thet's our out with Hildrith. We're
  gonna need one. I reckon Big Bill won't hold it hard agin us."</p>

  <p>Dale found himself divided between conflicting courses&mdash;one, to shoot
  these horse thieves in their tracks, and a stronger one, to stick to his
  first plan and avoid unnecessary hazard. Wherewith he noiselessly turned and
  began to crawl away from the log. He had to worm under spreading branches.
  Despite his care, a dead limb, invisible until too late, caught on his long
  spur, which gave forth a ringing metallic peal. At the sudden sound, Dale
  sank prone, his blood congealing in his veins.</p>

  <p>"Alec! You hear thet?" called Steve, his husky voice vibrantly sharp.</p>

  <p>"By Gawd I did!...Ring of a spur! I know thet sound."</p>

  <p>"Behind the log!"</p>

  <p>The thud of quick footsteps urged Dale out of his frozen inaction. He
  began to crawl for the brush.</p>

  <p>"There, Steve! I hear someone crawlin'. Smoke up thet black patch!"</p>

  <p>Gunshots boomed. Bullets thudded all around Dale. Then one tore through
  his sombrero, leaving a hot sensation on his scalp. A gust of passion
  intercepted Dale's desire to escape. He whirled to his knees. Both men were
  outlined distinctly in the firelight. The foremost stood just behind the log,
  his gun spouting red. The other crouched peering into the darkness. Dale shot
  them both. The leader fell hard over the log, and lodged there, his boots
  beating a rustling tattoo on the ground. The other flung his gun high and
  dropped as if his legs had been chopped from under him.</p>

  <p>Brittenham leaped erect, working the lever of his rifle, his nerves strung
  like wires. But the engagement had ended as quickly as it had begun. He
  strode into the campfire circle of light. The thief Ben lay on his back, arms
  wide, his dark visage distorted, ghastly. Dale's impulse was to search these
  men, but resisting it, he hurriedly made for the horses. The cold sick grip
  on his vitals eased with hurried action, and likewise the fury.</p>

  <p>Presently he reached the grassy plot where the horses were staked out.
  They snorted and thumped the ground. "Prince," he called, and whistled.</p>

  <p>The great stallion whinnied recognition. Dale made his way to the horse.
  Prince was blacker than the night. Dale laid gentle hands on him and talked
  to him. The other horses quieted down.</p>

  <p>"Jim...Jade...Ringspot...Bluegrass," called Dale, and repeated the names
  as he passed among the horses. They all were pets except Jade, and she was
  temperamental. She had to be now. Presently Dale untied her long stake rope,
  and after that the ropes of the other horses. He felt sure Prince and Jim
  would follow him anywhere, but he did not want to risk it then.</p>

  <p>He led the five horses back, as nearly as he could, on the course by which
  he had approached the camp. In the darkness the task was not easy. He chose
  to avoid the trail, which ran somewhere to the left. A tree and a thicket
  here and there he recognized. But he was off his direction when his own horse
  nickered to put him right again.</p>

  <p>"No more of that, Hoofs," he said, when he found his animal. Cinching his
  saddle, he gathered up the five halters and mounted. "Back-trail yourself,
  old boy!"</p>

  <p>The Waltrous horses were eager to follow, but the five of them abreast on
  uneven and obstructed ground held Dale to a slow and watchful progress.
  Meanwhile, as he picked his way, he began figuring the situation. It was
  imperative that he travel all night. There seemed hardly a doubt that the
  three thieves would be joined by others of their gang. Anyone save a novice
  could track six horses through a forest. Dale meant to be a long way on his
  back trail before dawn. The night was dark. He must keep close to the path of
  the horse thieves so that he would not get lost in this forest. Once out on
  the stage road, he could make up for slow travel.</p>

  <p>Trusting to Hoofs, the rider advanced, peering keenly into the gloom. He
  experienced no difficulty in leading the thoroughbreds; indeed they often
  slacked their halters and trampled almost at his heels. They knew they were
  homeward bound, in the charge of a friend. Dale hoped all was well, yet could
  not rid himself of a contrary presentiment. The reference of one of the horse
  thieves to Ben's double-crossing their comrades seemed to Dale to signify
  that the remaining outfit might be down in the Salmon River Valley.</p>

  <p>At intervals Dale swerved to the left far enough to see the trail in the
  gloom. When he could hear the babble of the brook, he knew he was going
  right. In due time he worked out of the open forest and struck the grade, and
  eventually got into the rocks. Here he had to follow the path, but he
  endeavored to keep his tracks out of it. And in this way he found himself at
  length in a shallow, narrow gulch, the sides of which appeared unscalable. If
  it were short, all would be well; on the other hand, he distrusted a long
  defile, where it would be perilous if he happened to encounter any riders.
  They would scarcely be honest riders.</p>

  <p>The gulch was long. Moreover, it narrowed and was dark as pitch except
  under the low walls. Dale did not like Hoofs's halting. His trusty mount had
  the nose and ears of the wild horses he had hunted for years.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, hoss?" queried Dale.</p>

  <p>Finally Hoofs stopped. Dale, feeling for his ears, found them erect and
  stiff. Hoofs smelled or heard something. It might be a bear or a cougar, both
  of which the horse disliked exceedingly. It might be more horse thieves, too.
  Dale listened and thought hard. Of all things, he did not want to retrace his
  steps. While he had time then, and before he knew what menaced further
  progress, he dismounted and led the horses as far under the dark wall as he
  could get them. Then he drew their heads up close to him and called low,
  "Steady, Prince...Jade, keep still...Blue, hold now..."</p>

  <p>Hoofs stood at his elbow. It was Dale's voice and hand that governed the
  intelligent animals. Then as a low trampling roar swept down the gully, they
  stood stiff. Dale tingled. Horses coming at a forced trot! They were being
  driven when they were tired. The sound swelled, and soon it was pierced by
  the sharp calls of riders.</p>

  <p>"By thunder!" muttered Dale, aghast at the volume of sounds. "My hunch was
  right!...Big Bill Mason has raided the valley...Must be over a hundred head
  in that drove."</p>

  <p>The thudding, padded roar, occasionally emphasized by an iron-shod hoof
  ringing on stone, or a rider's call, swept down the gully. It was upon Dale
  before he realized the drove was so close. He could see a moving, obscure
  mass coming. He smelled dust. "Git in thar!" shouted a weary voice. Then
  followed a soft thudding of hoofs on sand. Dale's situation was precarious,
  for if one of his horses betrayed his whereabouts, there would be riders
  sheering out for strays. He held the halters with his left hand, and pulled
  his rifle from its saddle sheath. If any of these raiders bore down on him,
  he would be forced to shoot and take to flight. But his thoroughbreds, all
  except Jade, stood like statues. She champed her bit restlessly. Then she
  snorted. Dale hissed at her. The moment was one to make him taut.</p>

  <p>He peered through the gloom, expecting riders to loom up, and he had the
  grim thought that it would be death for them. Then followed a long moment of
  sustained suspense, charged with incalculable chance.</p>

  <p>"Go along there, you lazy hawses," called a voice.</p>

  <p>The soft thumping of many hoofs passed. Voices trailed back. Dale relaxed
  in immeasurable relief. The driving thieves had gone by. He thought then for
  the first time what a thrilling thing it was going to be to return these
  thoroughbreds to Edith Watrous.</p>

  <p>Hard upon that came the thought of Leale Hildrith&mdash;his friend. It was
  agony to think that Leale was involved with these horse thieves. On the
  instant, Dale was shot through with the memory of his debt to
  Hildrith&mdash;of that terrible day when Hildrith had found him out on the
  range, crippled, half-starved and frozen, and had, at the risk of his own
  life, carried Dale through the blizzard to the safety of a distant shelter. A
  friendship had sprung up between the two men, generous and careless on
  Hildrith's part, even at times protective. In Dale had been engendered a
  passionate loyalty and gratitude, almost a hero worship for the
  golden-bearded Hildrith.</p>

  <p>What would come of it? No solution presented itself to Dale at the moment.
  He must meet situations as they arose, and seek in every way to protect his
  friend.</p>

  <p>Toward sunset the following day Dale Brittenham rode across the clattering
  old bridge, leading the Watrous thoroughbreds into the one and only street of
  Salmon. The dusty horses, five abreast, trotting at the end of long halters,
  would have excited interest in any Western town. But for some reason that
  puzzled Dale, he might have been leading a circus or a band of painted
  Indians.</p>

  <p>Before he had proceeded far, however, he grasped that something unusual
  accounted for the atmosphere of the thronged street. Seldom did Salmon,
  except on a Saturday night, show so much activity. Knots of men, evidently in
  earnest colloquy, turned dark faces in Dale's direction; gaudily dressed
  dance-hall girls, black-frocked gamblers, and dusty-booted, bearded miners
  crowded out in the street to see Dale approach; cowboys threw up their
  sombreros and let out their cracking whoops; and a throng of excited
  youngsters fell in behind Dale to follow him.</p>

  <p>Dale began to regret having chosen to ride through town, instead of
  fording the river below and circling to the Watrous ranch. He did not like
  the intense curiosity manifested by a good many spectators. Their gestures
  and words, as he rode by, he interpreted as more speculative and wondering
  than glad at his return with the five finest horses in Idaho.</p>

  <p>When Dale was about halfway down the wide street, a good friend of his
  detached himself from a group and stepped out.</p>

  <p>"Say, Wesley, what'n hell's all this hubbub about?" queried Brittenham as
  he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Howdy, Dale," returned the other, offering his hand. His keen eyes
  flashed like sunlight on blue metal and a huge smile wrinkled his bronzed
  visage. "Well, if I ain't glad to see you I'll eat my shirt...Just like you,
  Dale, to burst into town with thet bunch of hosses!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, I reckoned I'd like it. But I'm gettin' leary. What's up?"</p>

  <p>"Hoss thieves raided the river ranches yesterday," replied the other
  swiftly. "Two hundred head gone!...Chamberlain, Trash, Miller&mdash;all lost
  heavy. An' Jim Watrous got cleaned out. You know, lately Jim's gone in for
  cattle buyin', an' his riders were away somewhere. Jim lost over a hundred
  head. He's ory-eyed. An' they say Miss Edith was heartbroke to lose hers.
  Dale, you sure got the best of her other beaux with this job."</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" ejaculated Dale, feeling the hot blood in his cheeks, and he sat
  up stiffly. "Wes, damn you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dale, I've had you figgered as a shy hombre with girls. Every fellow in
  this valley, except you, has cocked his eyes at Edith Watrous. She's a flirt,
  we all know...Listen. I been achin' to tell you, my sister Sue is a friend of
  Edith, an' she says Edith likes you pretty well. Hildrith only has the inside
  track 'cause of her father. I'm tellin' you, Dale."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Wes. You always hated Hildrith, an' you're wrong about
  Edith."</p>

  <p>"Aw, hell! You're scared of her an' you overrate what Hildrith did for you
  once. Thet's all. This was the time for me to give you a hunch. I won't shoot
  off my chin again."</p>

  <p>"An' the town's all het-up over the horse-thief raid?"</p>

  <p>"You bet it is. Common talk runs thet there's some slick hombre here who's
  in with the hoss thieves. This Salmon Valley has lost nigh on to a thousand
  head in three years. An' every one of the big raids comes at a time when the
  thieves had to be tipped off."</p>

  <p>"All big horse-thief gangs work that way," replied Dale ponderingly.
  Wesley was trying to tell him that suspicion had fallen upon his head. He
  dropped his eyes as he inquired about his friend Leale Hildrith.</p>

  <p>"Humph! In town yesterday, roarin' louder than anybody about the raid.
  Swore this stealin' had to be stopped. Talked of offerin' ten thousand
  dollars' reward&mdash;that he'd set an outfit of riders after the thieves.
  You know how Leale raves. He's in town this mornin', too."</p>

  <p>"So long, Wes," said Dale soberly, and was about to ride on when a
  commotion broke the ring of bystanders to admit Leale Hildrith himself.</p>

  <p>Dale was not surprised to see the golden-bearded, booted, and spurred
  partner of Watrous, but he did feel a surprise at a fleeting and vanishing
  look in Hildrith's steel-blue eyes. It was a flash of hot murderous amazement
  at Dale there with Edith Watrous's thoroughbreds. Dale understood it
  perfectly, but betrayed no sign.</p>

  <p>"Dale! You son-of-a-gun!" burst out Hildrith in boisterous gladness as he
  leaped to seize Dale's hand and pumped it violently. His apparent warmth left
  Dale cold, and bitterly sad for his friend. "Fetched Edith's favorites back!
  How on earth did you do it, Dale? She'll sure reward you handsomely. And Jim
  will throw a fit...Where and how did you get back the horses?"</p>

  <p>"They were stolen out of the pasture yesterday mornin' about daylight,"
  replied Dale curtly. "I trailed the thieves. Found their camp last night.
  Three men, callin' themselves Ben, Alec, an' Steve. They were fightin' among
  themselves. Ben tricked them, the other two said. An' one of them shot
  him...They caught me listenen' and forced me to kill them."</p>

  <p>"You killed them!" queried Hildrith hoarsely, his face turning pale. His
  eyes held a peculiar oscillating question.</p>

  <p>"Yes. An' I didn't feel over-bad about it, Leale," rejoined Dale with
  sarcasm. "Then I wrangled the horses an' rode down."</p>

  <p>"Where was this?"</p>

  <p>"Up on the mountain, over in Montana somewhere. After nightfall I sure got
  lost. But I hit the stage road...I'll be movin' along, Leale."</p>

  <p>"I'll come right out to the ranch," replied Hildrith, and hurried through
  the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Open up, there," called Dale to the staring crowd. "Let me through."</p>

  <p>As he parted the circle and left it behind, a taunting voice cut the
  silence. "Cute of you, Dale, fetchin' the high-steppers back. Haw! Haw!"</p>

  <p>Dale rode on as if he had not heard, though he could have shot the owner
  of that mocking voice. He had been implicated in this horse. stealing. Salmon
  was full of shifty-eyed, hard-lipped men who would have had trouble in
  proving honest occupations. Dale had clashed with some of them, and he was
  hated and feared. He rode on through town and out into the country. He put
  the horses to a brisk trot, as he wanted to reach the Watrous ranch ahead of
  Hildrith.</p>

  <p>Dale stood appalled at the dual character of the man to whom he considered
  himself so deeply indebted, whom he had looked on as a friend and loved so
  much. It was almost impossible to believe. Almost every man in the valley
  liked Leale Hildrith and called him friend. The women loved him, and Dale
  felt sure, despite Wesley's blunt talk, that Edith Watrous was one of them.
  And if she did love him, she was on the way to disgrace and misery. Leale,
  the gay handsome blade, not yet thirty, so good-natured and kindly,
  bighearted and openhanded, was secretly nothing but a lowdown horse thief.
  Dale had hoped against hope that when he saw Hildrith the disclosures of the
  three horse thieves would somehow be disproved. But that had not happened.
  Hildrith's eyes, in only a flash, had betrayed him. Dale suffered the
  degradation of his own disillusion. Yet the thought of Edith's unhappiness
  hurt him even more.</p>

  <p>He had not gotten anywhere in his perplexed and bewildered state of mind
  when the bronze-and-gold hills of the Watrous ranch loomed before him. From
  the day he had ridden up to it, Dale had loved this great ranch, with its big
  old weather-beaten house nestling among the trees up from the river, its
  smooth shining hills bare to the gray rocks and timberline, its huge fields
  of corn and alfalfa green as emerald, its level range spreading away from the
  river gateway to the mountains. From that very day, too, Dale had loved the
  lithe, free-stepping, rouguish-eyed daughter of Jim Watrous, a melancholy and
  disturbing fact that he strove to banish from his consciousness. Her teasing
  and tormenting, her fits of cold indifference and her resentment that she
  could not make him bend to her like her other admirers, her flirting before
  his eyes plainly to make him jealous&mdash;all these weaknesses of Edith's
  did not equal in sum her kindness to him, and the strange inexplicable fact
  that when she was in trouble she always came to him.</p>

  <p>As Dale rode around the grove into the green square where the gray ranch
  house stood on its slope, he was glad to see that Hildrith had not arrived.
  Three saddled horses standing on the porch, and they had sighted him.
  Crowding to the high steps, they could be heard exclaiming. Then gray-haired
  Jim Watrous, stalwart of build and ruddy of face, descended down a step to
  call lustily, "Edith! Rustle out here. Quick!"</p>

  <p>Dale halted on the green below the porch. It was going to be a hard
  moment. Watrous and his visitors could not disturb him. But Edith!...Dale
  heard the swift patter of light feet&mdash;then a little scream, sweet,
  high-pitched, that raised a turbulent commotion in his breast.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dad!...My horses!" she exclaimed in ecstasy, and she clasped her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"They sure are, lass," replied Watrous gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Queer, Brittenham should fetch them," added a man back of
  Watrous.</p>

  <p>In two leaps Edith came down the high steps, supple as a cat, and bounded
  at Dale, her bright hair flying, her dark eyes shining.</p>

  <p>"Dale! Dale!" she cried rapturously, and ran to clasp both hands around
  his arm. "You old wild-horse hunter! You darling!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll stand for the first," said Dale, smiling down at her.</p>

  <p>"You'll stand for that...and hugs...and kisses when I get you alone, Dale
  Brittenham...You've brought back my horses! My heart was broken. I was crazy.
  I couldn't eat or sleep...Oh, it's too good to be true! Oh, Dale, I can never
  thank you enough."</p>

  <p>She left him to throw her arms around Prince's dusty neck and to cry over
  him. Watrous came slowly down the steps, followed by his three visitors, two
  of whom Dale knew by sight. He bent the eyes of a hawk upon Dale.</p>

  <p>"Howdy, Brittenham. What have you got to say for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Horses talk, Mr. Watrous, same as money," replied Dale coolly. He sensed
  the old horse trader's doubt and dismay.</p>

  <p>"They sure do, young man. There's ten thousand dollars' worth of
  horseflesh. To Edith they're priceless. What's your story?"</p>

  <p>Dale told it briefly, omitting the description of the horse-thief trail
  and the meeting upon it with the raided stock from the valley. He chose to
  save these details until he had had more time to ponder over them.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, you can prove those three horse thieves are dead&mdash;an'
  that you made away with two of them?" queried Watrous tensely.</p>

  <p>"Prove!" ejaculated Dale, sorely nettled. "I could prove
  it&mdash;certainly, sir, unless their pards came along to pack them
  away...But my word should be proof enough, Mr. Watrous."</p>

  <p>"I reckon it would be, for me, Brittenham," returned the rancher hastily.
  "But this whole deal has a queer look...This gang of horse thieves has an
  accomplice&mdash;maybe more than one&mdash;right here in Salmon."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Watrous, I had the same thought," said Dale shortly. "Last night,
  Brittenham, your name was whispered around in this connection."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't surprise me. Salmon is full of crooked men. I've clashed
  with some. I've only a few friends, an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Edith whirled to confront her father with pale face and blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dad! Did I hear right? What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, lass. I told Brittenham he was suspected of bein' the
  go-between for this horse-thief gang."</p>

  <p>"For shame, Father! It's a lie. Dale Brittenham would not steal, let alone
  be a cowardly informer."</p>

  <p>"Edith, I didn't say I believed it," rejoined Watrous, plainly upset. "But
  it's bein' said about town. It'll fly over the range. An' I thought
  Brittenham should know."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Mr. Watrous," said Dale. "Thank you for tellin' me."</p>

  <p>The girl turned to Dale, evidently striving for composure. "Come, Dale.
  Let us take the horses out."</p>

  <p>She led them across the green toward the lane. Dale had no choice but to
  follow, though he desperately wanted to flee. Before the men were out of
  range of his acute hearing, one of them exclaimed to Watrous. "Jim, he didn't
  deny it!"</p>

  <p>"Huh! Did you see his eyes?" returned the rancher shortly. "I'd not want
  to be in the boots of the man who accuses him-to his face."</p>

  <p>"Here comes Hildrith, drivin' as if the devil was after him."</p>

  <p>Dale heard the clattering buckboard, but he did not look. Neither did
  Edith. She walked with her head down, deep in thought. Dale dared to watch
  her, conscious of inexplicable feelings.</p>

  <p>The stable boy, Joe, ran out to meet them, with a face that was a study in
  inexpressible wonder and delight. Edith did not relinquish the halters until
  she had led the horses up the incline into the wide barn.</p>

  <p>"Joe, water them first," she said. "Then wash and rub them down. Take a
  look at their hoofs. Feed them a little alfalfa. And watch them every minute
  till the boys get back."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Edith, I shore will," he replied eagerly. "We done had words
  they'll be hyar by dark."</p>

  <p>Dale dismounted and removed saddle and bridle from his tired horse.</p>

  <p>"Let Joe watch your horse, Dale. I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>Dale leaned against some bales of hay, not wholly from weariness. He had
  often been alone with Edith Watrous, but never like this.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I ought to...to clean up," he stammered, removing his sombrero.
  "I...I must look a mess."</p>

  <p>"You're grimy and worn, yes. But you look pretty proven and good to me,
  Dale Brittenham...What's that hole in your hat?"</p>

  <p>"By thunder! I forgot about that. It's a bullet hole."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;so close...Who shot it there, Dale?"</p>

  <p>"One of the horse thieves."</p>

  <p>"It was self-defense, then?"</p>

  <p>"You bet it was."</p>

  <p>"I've hated your shooting scrapes, Dale," she rejoined earnestly. "But
  here I see I'm squeamish&mdash;and unreasonable...Only the reputation you
  have&mdash;your readiness to shoot&mdash;that's all I never liked about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. But I can't help that," replied Dale, turning his sombrero
  round and round with restless hands.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be sorry this time...Dale, look me straight in the eye."</p>

  <p>Thus so earnestly urged, Dale had to comply. Edith appeared pale of face
  and laboring under suppressed emotion. Her dark eyes had held many
  expressions for him, mostly roguish and coquettish, and sometimes blazing,
  but at this moment they were beautiful with a light, a depth he had never
  seen in them before. And it challenged him with a truth he had always driven
  from his consciousness&mdash;that he loved this bright-haired girl.</p>

  <p>"Dale, I was ashamed of Dad," she said. "I detest that John Stafford. He
  is the one who brought the gossip from town&mdash;that you were implicated in
  this raid. I don't believe it.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Edith. It's good of you."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say something?" she asked spiritedly. "You should have
  cussed Dad roundly."</p>

  <p>"I was sort of flabbergasted."</p>

  <p>"Dale, if this whole range believed you were a horse thief, I wouldn't.
  Even if your faithful Nalook believed it&mdash;though he never would."</p>

  <p>"No. I reckon that Indian wouldn't believe bad of me."</p>

  <p>"Nalook thinks heaps of you, Dale...and...and that's one reason why I do
  too."</p>

  <p>"Heaps?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, heaps."</p>

  <p>"I'd never have suspected it."</p>

  <p>"Evidently you never did. But it's true. And despite your...your
  rudeness...your avoidance of me, now is the time to tell it."</p>

  <p>Dale dropped his eyes again, sorely perturbed and fearful that he might
  betray himself. Edith was not bent on conquest now. She appeared roused to
  championship of him, and there was something strange and soft about her that
  was <i>new</i> and bewildering.</p>

  <p>"I never was rude," he denied stoutly.</p>

  <p>"We won't argue about that now," she went on hurriedly. "Never mind about
  me and my petty vanity...I'm worried about this gossip. It's serious, Dale.
  You'll get into trouble and go gunning for somebody&mdash;unless I keep you
  from it. I'm going to try...Will you take a job riding for me&mdash;taking
  care of my horses?"</p>

  <p>"Edith!...I'm sure obliged to you for that offer. But Watrous wouldn't see
  it."</p>

  <p>"I'll make him see it."</p>

  <p>"Hildrith?...He wouldn't like that idea now."</p>

  <p>"Leale will like anything I want him to."</p>

  <p>"Not this time."</p>

  <p>"Dale, <i>will</i> you ride for me?" she queried impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to...if...if...Well, I'll consider it."</p>

  <p>"If you would, that'd stop this gossip more than anything I can think
  of...I'd like it very much, Dale. I'll never feel safe about my horses again.
  Not until these thieves are rounded up. If you worked for me, I could keep
  you here&mdash;out of that rotten Salmon. And you wouldn't be going on those
  long wild-horse hunts."</p>

  <p>"Edith, you're most amazin'&mdash;kind an'...an' thoughtful all of a
  sudden." Dale could not quite keep a little bitter surprise out of his
  voice.</p>

  <p>She blushed vividly. "I might have been all that long ago&mdash;if you had
  let me," she responded.</p>

  <p>"Who am I to aspire to your kindness?" he said almost coldly. "But even if
  I wasn't a poor wild-horse hunter, I'd never run after you like
  these...these&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe that's one reason why...Well, never mind," she interrupted, with a
  hint of her old roguishness. "Dale, I'm terribly grateful to you for bringing
  back my horses. I know you won't take money. I'm afraid you'll refuse the job
  I offered...So, Mr. Wild-Horse Hunter, I'm going to pay you as I said I would
  back at the house."</p>

  <p>"No!" he cried, suddenly weak. "Edith, you wouldn't be so silly...so...Aw,
  it's just the devil in you."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to, Dale."</p>

  <p>Her voice drew him as well as her intent; and forced to look up, he was
  paralyzed to see her bending to him, her face aglow, her eyes alight. Her
  hands flashed upon his shoulders&mdash;slipped back&mdash;and suddenly
  pressed like bands of steel. Dale somehow recovered strength to stand up and
  break her hold.</p>

  <p>"Edith, you're out of...your head," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if I am. I always wanted to, Dale Brittenham. This was a
  good excuse...and I'll never get another."</p>

  <p>The girl's face was scarlet as she drew back from Dale, but it paled
  before she concluded her strange speech.</p>

  <p>"You're playin' with me&mdash;you darned flirt," he blurted out.</p>

  <p>"Not this time, Dale," she replied soberly, and then Dale grasped that
  something deeper and hitherto unguessed had followed hard on her real desire
  to reward him for his service.</p>

  <p>"It'll be now or never, Dale...For this morning at breakfast, I gave in at
  last to Dad's nagging...and consented to marry Leale Hildrith."</p>

  <p>"Then it'll be never, my strange girl," replied Dale hoarsely, shot
  through with anguish for Edith and his treacherous friend. "I...I reckoned
  this was the case...You love Leale?"</p>

  <p>"I think...I do," replied Edith somewhat hesitantly. "He's handsome and
  gay. Everybody loves Leale. You do. All the girls are mad about him, I...I
  love him, I guess...But it's mostly Dad. He hasn't given me any peace for a
  year. He's set on Hildrith. Then he thinks I ought to settle down...that I
  flirt...that I have all his riders at odds with each other on my
  account...Oh, it made me furious."</p>

  <p>"Edith, I hope you will be happy."</p>

  <p>"A lot <i>you</i> care, Dale Brittenham."</p>

  <p>"I cared too much. That was the trouble."</p>

  <p><i>"Dale!</i>...So that was why you avoided me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was why, Edith."</p>

  <p>"But you are as good as any man."</p>

  <p>"You're a rich rancher's daughter. I'm a poor wild-horse hunter."</p>

  <p>"Oh! As if that made any difference between friends."</p>

  <p>"Edith, it does," he replied sadly. "An' now they're accusin' me of being
  a horse thief...I'll have to kill again."</p>

  <p>"No! You mustn't fight," she cried wildly. "You might be shot. Dale,
  promise me you'll not go gunning for anyone."</p>

  <p>"That's easy, Edith. I promise."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Dale...Oh, I don't know what's come over me." She dropped her
  head on his shoulder. "I'm glad you told me. It hurts&mdash;but it helps
  somehow. I...I must think."</p>

  <p>"You should think that you must not be seen...like this," he said
  gently.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she flashed, suddenly aroused. Edith's propensity to
  change was one of her bewildering charms. Dale realized he had said the wrong
  thing and he shook in her tightening grasp. "You've cheated me, Dale, of a
  real friendship. And I'm going to punish you. I'm going to keep my word, no
  matter what comes of it...Oh, you'll believe me a flirt&mdash;like Dad and
  all of these old fools that think I've kissed these beaux of mine. But I
  haven't&mdash;well, not since I was a kid. Not even Leale!...Dale, you might
  have kissed me if you'd had any sense."</p>

  <p>"Edith, have <i>you</i> lost all sense of...of..." he choked out.</p>

  <p>"Of modesty?...I'm not in the least ashamed." But her face flamed as she
  tightened her arms around him and pressed sweet cool lips to his cheek. Dale
  was almost unable to resist crushing her in his arms. He tried, weakly, to
  put her back. But she was strong, and evidently in the grip of some emotion
  she had not calculated upon. For her lips sought his and their coolness
  turned to sweet fire. Her eyelids fell heavily. Dale awoke to spend his
  hunger for love and his renunciation in passionate response.</p>

  <p>That broke the spell which had moved Edith.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dale!" she whispered as she wrenched her lips free. "I shouldn't
  have...Forgive me...I was beside myself."</p>

  <p>Her arms were sliding from his neck when quick footfalls and the ring of
  spurs sounded in the doorway. Dale looked up to see Hildrith, livid under his
  golden beard, with eyes flaring, halting at the threshold.</p>

  <p>"What the hell!" he burst out incredulously.</p>

  <p>Dale's first sensation was one of blank dismay, and as Edith, with arms
  dropping, drew back, crimson of face, he sank against the pile of bales like
  a guilty man caught in some unexplainable act.</p>

  <p>"Edith, what did I see?" demanded Hildrith in jealous wrath.</p>

  <p>"Not very much! You were too late. Why do you slip up on people like
  that?" the girl returned with a tantalizing laugh. She faced him, her blush
  and confusion vanishing. His strident voice no doubt roused her imperious
  spirit. "You had your arms around Dale?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I had."</p>

  <p>"You kissed him?"</p>

  <p>"Once...No, twice, counting a little one," returned this amazing creature.
  Dale suffered some kind of torture, only part of which was shame.</p>

  <p>"Well, by heaven!" shouted Hildrith furiously. "I'll beat him half to
  death for that."</p>

  <p>Edith intercepted him and got between him and Dale. She pushed him back
  with no little force. "Don't be a fool, Leale. It'd be dangerous to strike
  Dale. Listen..."</p>

  <p>"I'll call him out," shouted her lover.</p>

  <p>"And get shot for your pains. Dale has killed half a dozen men...Let me
  explain."</p>

  <p>"You can't explain a thing like this."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can. I admit it looks bad, but it really isn't...When Dale brought
  my horses back, I was so crazy with joy that I wanted to hug and kiss him. I
  told him so. But I couldn't before Dad and all those men. When we came out
  here I...I tried to, but Dale repulsed me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Edith! Do you expect me to believe that?" queried Hildrith.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's true...But the second time, I succeeded&mdash;and you almost
  caught me in the act."</p>

  <p>"You damned little flirt!"</p>

  <p>"Leale, I wasn't flirting. I wanted to kiss Dale; I was in rapture about
  my horses. And before that, Dad and those men hinted Dale was hand and glove
  with these horse thieves. I hated that. It excited me. Perhaps I was out of
  my head. Dale said I was. But you shall not blame him. It was my fault."</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell!" fumed Hildrith in despair. "Do you deny the poor beggar is in
  love with you?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do deny that," she retorted, and her gold-tan cheeks flamed
  red.</p>

  <p>"Well, he is. Anybody could see that."</p>

  <p>"I didn't. And if it's true, he never told me."</p>

  <p>Hildrith began to pace the barn. "Good God! Engaged to marry me for half a
  day, and you do a brazen thing like that...Watrous is sure right. You need to
  be tied down. Playing fast and loose with every rider on the range! Coaxing
  your Dad to set our marriage day three months off!...Oh, you drive me mad.
  I'll tell you, young woman, when you <i>are</i> my wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't insult me, Mr. Hildrith," interrupted Edith coldly. "I'm not your
  wife yet. I was honest with you because I felt sure you'd understand. I'm
  sorry I told you the truth, and I don't care whether you believe me or
  not."</p>

  <p>With her bright head erect, she walked past Hildrith, avoiding him as he
  reached for her, and she was deaf to his entreaties.</p>

  <p>"Edith, I'll take it all back," he cried after her. But so far as Dale
  could see or hear, she made no response. Hildrith turned away from the door,
  wringing his hands. It was plain that he worshiped the girl, that he did not
  trust her, that he was inordinately suspicious, that for an accepted lover he
  appeared the most wretched of men. Dale watched him, seeing him more clearly
  in the revelation of his dual nature. Just how far Hildrith had gone with
  this horse-stealing gang, Dale did not want to know. Dale did see that his
  friend's redemption was possible&mdash;that if he could marry this girl, and
  if he could be terribly frightened with possible exposure, he might be weaned
  from whatever association he had with Mason, and go honest and make Edith
  happy. It was not a stable conviction, but it gripped Dale. He had his debt
  to pay to Hildrith, and a glimmering of a possible way to do it formed in his
  mind. Even at that moment, though, he felt the ax of disillusion and reality
  at the roots of his love for this man. Hildrith was not what he had believed
  him. But that would not deter Dale from paying his debt a thousandfold.
  Lastly, if Edith Watrous loved this man, Dale felt that he must save him.</p>

  <p>Hildrith whirled upon Dale. "So this is how you appreciate what I've done
  for you, Dale. You made love to my girl. You damned handsome
  ragamuffin&mdash;you worked on Edith's sympathy! You've got me into a hell of
  a fix."</p>

  <p>"Leale, you sure are in a hell of a fix," replied Dale with dark
  significance.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" queried Hildrith sharply, with a quick uplift of
  head.</p>

  <p>"You're one of Big Bill Mason's gang," rejoined Dale deliberately.</p>

  <p>Hildrith gave a spasmodic start, as if a blade had pierced his side. His
  jaw dropped and his face blanched to an ashen hue under his blond beard. He
  tried to speak, but no words came.</p>

  <p>"I sneaked up on the camp of those three horse thieves. I listened. Those
  low-down thieves&mdash;Ben, Alec, Steve&mdash;spoke familiarly of you. Alec
  an' Steve were concerned over what you'd do about the theft of the Watrous
  horses. Ben made light of it. He didn't care. They talked about Big Bill. An'
  that talk betrayed you to me...Leale, you're the range scout for Mason.
  You're the man who sets the time for these big horse raids."</p>

  <p>"You know!...Oh, my God!" cried Hildrith abjectly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that an' more. I know the trail to Mason's secret rendezvous.
  I was on that trail an' saw this last big drove of stolen horses pass by. I
  figured out how Mason's gang operates. Pretty foxy. I'll say. But it was too
  good, too easy, too profitable. It couldn't last."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Dale, don't squeal on me!" besought Hildrith, bending
  over Dale with haggard, clammy face. "I've money. I'll pay you
  well&mdash;anything..."</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Don't try to buy me off, or I'll despise you for a yellow
  cur...I didn't say I'd squeal on you. But I do say you're a madman to think
  you can work long at such a low-down game."</p>

  <p>"Dale, I swear to God this was my last deal. Mason forced me to one more,
  a big raid which was to be his last in this valley. He had a hold on me. We
  were partners in a cattle business over in Montana. He roped me into a
  rustling deal before I knew what it actually was. That was three years ago,
  over in Kalispel. Then he found a hiding place, a box canyon known only to
  the Indians, and that gave him the idea of raiding both Montana and Idaho
  ranges at the same time&mdash;driving to the canyon and there changing
  outfits and stolen horses. While a raid was on over there, Mason made sure to
  be in Bannock or Kalispel, and he roared louder than anyone at the horse
  thieves. He had the confidence of all the ranchers over there. My job was the
  same here in the Salmon Valley. But I fell in love with Edith and have been
  trying to break away."</p>

  <p>"Leale, you say you swear to God this was your last deal with Mason?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I swear it. I have been scared to death. I got to thinking it was
  too good to last. I'd be found out. Then I'd lose Edith."</p>

  <p>"Man, you'd not only lose her. But you'd be shot&mdash;or worse, you'd be
  hanged. These ranchers are roused. Watrous is ory-eyed, so Wesley told me.
  They'll organize an' send a bunch of Wyomin' cowboys out on Mason's trail.
  I'll bet that's exactly what Watrous is talkin' over now with these
  visitors."</p>

  <p>"Then it's too late. They'll find me out. God! Why didn't I have some
  sense?"</p>

  <p>"They won't find you out if you quit. Absolutely quit! I'm the only man
  outside the Mason gang who knows. If some of them are captured an' try to
  implicate you, it wouldn't be believed. I'll not give you away."</p>

  <p>"Dale, by heaven, that's good of you," said Hildrith hoarsely. "I did you
  an injustice. Forgive me...Dale, tell me what to do. I'm in your hands. I'll
  do anything. Only save me. I wasn't cut out for a horse thief. It's galled
  me. I've been sick after every raid. I haven't the guts. I've learned an
  awful lesson."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea how Edith would despise you if she knew?"</p>

  <p>"That's what makes me sweat blood. I worship the very ground she walks
  on."</p>

  <p>"Does she love you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord, I don't know now. I thought so. She said she did. But she
  wouldn't...She promised to marry me. Watrous wants her settled. If she will
  marry me, I know I can make her love me."</p>

  <p>"Never if you continued to be a two-faced, dirty, lousy, yellow dog of a
  horse thief," cried Dale forcefully. "You've got to perform a miracle. You've
  got to change. That's the price of my silence."</p>

  <p>"Dale, I'm torn apart...What use to swear? You know I'll quit&mdash;and go
  straight all my life. For Edith! What man wouldn't? You would if she gave
  herself...any man would. Don't you see?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that, an' I believe you," replied Dale, convinced of the truth
  in Hildrith's agony. "I'll keep your secret, an' find a way to save you if
  any unforseen thing crops up...An' that squares me with you, Leale
  Hildrith."</p>

  <p>Swift light footsteps that scattered the gravel cut short Hildrith's
  impassioned gratitude. Edith startled Dale by appearing before them, her hand
  at her breast, her face white as a sheet, her eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>Hildrith met her on the incline, exclaiming, "Why, Edith! Running back
  like that! What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>She paid no heed to him, but ran to Dale, out of breath and visibly
  shaking.</p>

  <p>"Oh...Dale..." she panted. "Stafford sent...for the sheriff!...They're
  going to...arrest you."</p>

  <p>"Stafford? Who's he? That man in the black coat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He's lately got in with Dad...Cattle. It's his outfit of cowboys
  coming...He's hard as nails."</p>

  <p>"Are they here?"</p>

  <p>"Will be directly. I tore loose from Dad...and ran all the way...Oh, Dale,
  what will you do?" She was unconscious of her emotion&mdash;and she put an
  appealing hand upon Dale's arm. Dale had never seen her like that, nor had
  Hildrith. They were deeply struck, each according to his reception of her
  white-faced, earnest demeanor.</p>

  <p>"Edith, you can bet I won't run," declared Dale grimly. "Thank you, girl,
  all the same...Don't take this so...so strangely. Why, you're all upset. They
  can't arrest me."</p>

  <p>Hildrith drew back from the wide door. He appeared no less alarmed and
  excited than Edith. "They're coming, Dale," he said thickly. "Bayne and
  Stafford in the lead...That sheriff has it in for you, Dale. Only last night
  I heard him swear he'd jail you if you came back...It's ticklish business.
  What'll you do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know," returned Dale with a laugh. Edith besought him,
  "Oh, Dale, don't kill Bayne!...For my sake!"</p>

  <p>"If you brace up, I reckon maybe I can avoid that."</p>

  <p>Dale led his horse out of the barn, down the runway into the open. Then he
  stepped aside to face the advancing men, now nearly across the wide court.
  The dark-garbed Stafford was talking and gesticulating vehemently to a
  stalwart booted man. This was the one officer that Salmon supported, and it
  had been said of him that he knew which side of the law to be on. Watrous and
  three other men brought up the rear. They made no bones about sheering off to
  the side. Stafford, however, a swarthy and pompous man, evidently accustomed
  to authority, remained beside Bayne.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you," called out Dale, far from civilly. "If you want to talk with
  me, that's close enough."</p>

  <p>Hildrith, to Dale's surprise, came down in the incline and took up a stand
  beside Dale.</p>

  <p>"What you mean by this turkey-strutting?" he demanded, and his simulation
  of resentment would have deceived anyone but Dale.</p>

  <p>"Hildrith, we got business with Brittenham," declared Bayne harshly.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's my friend, and that concerns me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Leale," interposed Dale. "But let me handle this. Bayne, are you
  looking for me?"</p>

  <p>"I sure am."</p>

  <p>"At whose instigation?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stafford, here. He sent for me, an' he orders you arrested."</p>

  <p>Watrous broke in to say nervously, "Brittenham, I adivsed against this. I
  have nothing to do with it. I don't approve of resorting to law on the
  strength of gossip. If you'll deny any association with horse thieves, that
  will do for me. If your word is good to Edith, it ought to be for me."</p>

  <p>"Jim Watrous, you're a fool," rasped out Stafford. "Your daughter is
  apparently infatuated with this...this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Careful!" cut in Dale. "You might say the wrong thing. An' leave Miss
  Edith's name out of this deal...Stafford, what's your charge against me?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're one of this horse-raiding gang," declared Stafford
  stoutly, though he turned pale.</p>

  <p>"On what grounds?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't influenced by gossip, sir. I base my suspicion on your fetching
  back those thoroughbred horses. They must have been driven off by mistake.
  Any horse thief would know they couldn't be ridden or sold in Montana or
  Idaho. They'd be recognized. So you fetched them back because it was good
  business. Besides, it'd put you in better with Watrous, and especially
  his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up! If you speak of that girl again, I'll shoot your leg off,"
  interrupted Dale. "An' you can gamble on this, Stafford: if I don't shoot you
  anyhow, it'll be the only peg on which you can hang a doubt of my
  honesty."</p>

  <p>"You insolent ruffian!" ejaculated Stafford, enraged and intimidated.
  "Arrest him, sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, you'll have to come with me," spoke up Bayne with an uneasy
  cough. "You appear to be a talker. You'll get a chance to talk in court at
  Twin Falls."</p>

  <p>"You're tryin' to go through with it?" asked Dale derisively.</p>

  <p>"I say you're under arrest."</p>

  <p>"What's <i>your</i> charge?"</p>

  <p>"Same as Mr. Stafford's."</p>

  <p>"But that's ridiculous, Bayne. You can't arrest a man for bringing back
  stolen horses. There's not the slightest case against me. Stafford has heard
  gossip in town&mdash;where half the population is crooked. How do I know an'
  how do you know that Stafford himself is not the big hand in this
  horse-stealin' gang? There's some big respectable rancher on this range who
  stands in with the thieves. Why do you pick on a poor wild-horse hunter? A
  ragamuffin, as he has called me. Look at my boots! Look at my saddle! If I
  was the go-between, wouldn't I have better equipment? You're not very bright,
  Bayne."</p>

  <p>"Aw, that's all bluff. Part of your game. An' you've sure pulled it clever
  around here for three years."</p>

  <p>While Dale had prolonged this argument, his mind had been conceiving and
  fixing upon a part he wanted to play. It would have been far easier but for
  Edith's inexplicable importunity. She had awakened to something strange and
  hitherto unrevealed. It must have been pity, and real sincerity and regret
  come too late. Then, the girl had always been fair in judging something
  between others. If Dale had had an inkling it was anything else, he never
  could have made the sacrifice, not even to save Hildrith. But she loved
  Hildrith; she would become his wife, and that surely meant his salvation.
  Dale felt that ignominy, a bad name thrust upon him, and acknowledged by his
  actions, could not make much difference to him. He was only a wild-horse
  hunter. He could ride away to Arizona and never be heard of again. Still, he
  hated the thing he felt driven to do.</p>

  <p>Then Edith stepped into the foreground, no longer the distraught girl who
  had arrived there a few moments ago to warn Dale. Had she read his mind? That
  suspicion affected him more stirringly than anything yet that had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff Bayne, you must not try to arrest Dale without proof," she said
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, lady. It's my duty. He'll get a fair trial."</p>

  <p>"Fair!" she exclaimed scornfully. "When this arrest is so unfair! Bayne,
  there's something wrong&mdash;something dishonest here&mdash;and it's not in
  Dale."</p>

  <p>"Edith, don't say more," interposed her father. "You're overwrought."</p>

  <p>Hildrith strode to her side, hurried in manner, dark and strained of
  face.</p>

  <p>"Leale, why don't you speak up for Dale?" she queried, and her eyes blazed
  upon him with a marvelously penetrating and strange look.</p>

  <p>"Bayne, let Dale off," Hildrith said huskily. "Don't make a mistake here.
  You've no proof&mdash;and you can't arrest him."</p>

  <p>"Can't! Why the hell can't I?" rejoined the sheriff. "Because he won't let
  you. Good God, man, haven't you any mind?"</p>

  <p>"Humph! I've got mind enough to see there's somethin' damn funny here. But
  it ain't in me...Brittenham, you're under arrest. Come on, now, no
  buckin'."</p>

  <p>As he made a step forward, Dale's gun gleamed blue and menacing.</p>

  <p>"Look out, Bayne! If you move a hand, I'll kill you," he warned.</p>

  <p>He backed cautiously down the court, leading his horse to one side.</p>

  <p>"I see what I'm up against here, an' I'm slopin'," went on Dale.
  "Stafford, you had it figured. Watrous, I engineered that raid...Edith, I
  fetched your horses back because I was in love with you." A strange laugh
  followed his words.</p>

  <p>Dale backed across the square to the lane, where he leaped into his saddle
  and spurred swiftly out of sight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">DALE'S campfire that night was on a bend of the brook near
  where he had surprised the three horse thieves and had recovered the Watrous
  thoroughbreds.</p>

  <p>Upon riding away from the Watrous ranch, he had halted in Salmon long
  enough to buy supplies; then he had proceeded down the river to a lonely
  place where he had rested his horse and slept. By dawn he was climbing the
  mountain into Montana, and by sundown that night he was far down the
  horse-thief trail.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Dale had branded himself by shouldering
  Hildrith's guilt, he had determined to find Big Bill Mason's rendezvous and
  evolve a plan to break up the horse-thief band. Born of his passion at riding
  away from the Watrous ranch a fugitive, leaving Edith to regret her faith in
  him, this plan seemed to loom as gigantic and impossible after the long hours
  of riding and thinking. But he would not abandon it.</p>

  <p>"Stafford and Bayne will send a big outfit after me," he muttered as he
  sat before his little campfire. "An' I'll lead them to Mason's hiding place,
  Failin' that, I'll go down on the range below Bannock an' get the ranchers
  there to raise a big posse of cowboys. One way or another I'm goin' to break
  up Mason's gang."</p>

  <p>Dale had not thought of that in the hour of his sacrifice for Hildrith and
  Edith. He had meant to take his friend's ignominy and ride away from Idaho
  forever. But two things had operated against this&mdash;first, the astounding
  and disturbing fact that Edith Watrous, in her stress of feeling, had
  betrayed not only faith in him but also more real friendship than she had
  ever shown; and secondly, his riding away in disgrace would leave the Mason
  gang intact, free to carry on their nefarious trade. He was the man for the
  job. If he broke up the gang, it would remove the stain from his name. Not
  that he would ever want to or dare to go back to the Watrous ranch! But there
  was a tremendous force in the thought that he might stand clean and fine
  again in Edith Watrous's sight. How strangely she had reacted to that
  situation when her father and the others had confronted him! What could she
  have meant when she said there was something wrong, something dishonest there
  in that climax? Could she have had a glimmering of the truth? This thought
  was so disturbing that it made Dale catch his breath. Edith was a
  resourceful, strong-minded girl, once she became aroused. On reflection,
  however, he eased away that doubt, and also the humanly weak joy at a
  possible indestructible faith in him. No! He felt sure Hildrith would be
  safe. Once the Mason outfit was broken up, with the principals killed and the
  others run out of the country, Hildrith would be safe, and Edith's happiness
  would be assured.</p>

  <p>In hours past, Dale had, in the excitement of his flight, believed that he
  could kill his love for Edith Watrous and forget her. This proved to be an
  illusion, the recognition of which came to him beside his lonely campfire. He
  would love her more, because his act had been something big and for her sake,
  and in his secret heart he would know that if she could be told the truth,
  she would see her faith justified, and whatever feeling she had for him would
  be intensified.</p>

  <p>He saw her dark proud eyes and her white face in the opal glow of his
  fire. And having succumbed to that, he could not help but remember her
  boldness to reward him, her arms and her kiss, and, most poignant of all, the
  way she had been betrayed by her impulse, how that kiss had trapped her into
  emotion she had not intended. Was it possible that he had had this chance for
  Edith Watrous and had never divined it? The thought was torture, and he put
  it from him, assuring himself that the girl's actions had been the result of
  her gratitude and joy at the return of her beloved horses.</p>

  <p>The fire died down to ruddy coals; the night wind began to seep through
  the grass and brush; four-footed prowlers commenced their questing. Standing
  erect, Dale listened. He heard his horse cropping the grass. A brooding
  solitude lay upon the forest.</p>

  <p>He made his bed close under the side of a fallen pine, using his saddle
  for a pillow. So many nights of his life he had lain down to look up at the
  open dark sky with its trains of stars. But this night the stars appeared
  closer and they seemed to talk to him. He was conscious that his stern task,
  and the circumstances which had brought it about, had heightened all his
  faculties to a superlative degree. He seemed a vastly different man, and he
  conceived that it might develop that he would revel in what fate had set him
  to do.</p>

  <p>At last he fell asleep. During the night he awoke several times, and the
  last time, which was near dawn and nippingly cold, he got up and kindled a
  fire. All about him rose dark gray forest wall, except in the east, where a
  pale brightening betokened dawn.</p>

  <p>It was Dale's custom to cook and eat a hearty breakfast, so that he could
  go long on this meal if he had to. His last task before saddling was to
  obliterate signs of his camp. Then, with light enough to see clearly, he
  mounted and was off on his perilous quest.</p>

  <p>All the way, Dale had kept off the main trail. It would take an Indian or
  a wild-horse hunter to track him. He traveled some few paces off the
  horse-thief trail, but kept it in sight. And every mile or so he would halt,
  dismount, and walk a few steps away from his horse to listen. In that silent
  forest he could have heard a sound at a considerable distance.</p>

  <p>By sunrise he was down out of the heavy timber belt and riding out upon a
  big country of scaly rock and immense thickets of evergreen and cedar, with
  only an occasional large pine. The brook disappeared&mdash;probably dried up,
  or sunk into the earth. The trail led on straight as a beeline for a
  while.</p>

  <p>The sun rose high, and grew hot. With the morning half spent, he figured
  that he had traveled fifteen miles from his last camp. Occasionally he had
  glimpses of the lower range, gray and vast and dim below. The trail turned
  west, into more rugged plateaus and away from the descent. But presently,
  beyond a long fringe of evergreen thicket, he saw the peculiar emptiness that
  proclaimed the presence of a void.</p>

  <p>Dale knew before he reached it that he had come upon the hole in the
  ground where Big Bill Mason had his hideout. Leaving the proximity of the
  trail, Dale rode to a little higher ground, where a gray stone eminence, less
  thickly overgrown, seemed to offer easy access to the place. Here he
  dismounted and pushed his way through the evergreens. At once he emerged upon
  a point, suddenly to stand rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>"What a wonderful place," he exclaimed as he grasped the fact that his
  sight commanded. He stood upon the rim of a deep gorge a mile long and half
  as wide. On all sides, the walls sheered down a thousand feet, gray and
  craggy, broken and caverned, lined by green benches, and apparently
  unscalable. Of course trails led in and out of this hole, but Dale could not
  see where. The whole vast level bottomland was as green as an emerald. At
  <i>each</i> end, where the gorge narrowed, glistened a lake. All around the
  rims stood up a thick border of evergreens, which screened the gorge from
  every side. Hunters and riders could pass near there without ever guessing
  the presence of such a concealed pocket in the mountain plateau.</p>

  <p>"Ahuh. No wonder Mason can steal horses wholesale," soliloquized Dale.
  "All he had to do was to hide his tracks just after he made a raid."</p>

  <p>Dale reflected that the thieves had succeeded in this up to present time.
  However, any good tracker could sooner or later find this rendezvous for
  resting and shifting droves of horses. Dale was convinced that Stafford and
  Watrous would send out a large outfit of riders as soon as they were
  available.</p>

  <p>It struck Dale singularly that he could not see an animal or a cabin in
  the gorge below. But undoubtedly there were points not visible to him from
  this particular location. Returning to his horse, he decided to ride around
  the gorge to look for another trail.</p>

  <p>He found, after riding for a while, that although the gorge was hardly
  more than three or four miles in circumference, to circle it on horseback or
  even on foot, a man would have to travel three times that far. There were
  canyon offshoots from the main valley, and these had to be headed.</p>

  <p>At the west side Dale found one almost as long as the gorge itself. But it
  was narrow. Here he discovered the first sign of a trail since he had left
  the main one. And this was small, and had never been traveled by a drove of
  horses. It led off to the south toward Bannock. Dale deliberated a moment. If
  he were to risk going down to investigate this trail, about halfway between
  the lakes at each end should be the one for him to take. Certainly it did not
  show much usage. At length he rode down, impelled by a force that seemed to
  hold less of reason than of presagement.</p>

  <p>It grew steep in the notch, and shady, following a precipitous
  watercourse. He had to get off and lead his horse. Soon trees and brush
  obstructed his view. The trail was so steep that he could only proceed
  slowly, and before he surmised that he was halfway down, he emerged into the
  open'to see a beautiful narrow valley, richly green, enclosed by timbered
  slopes. A new cabin of peeled logs stood in the lea of the north side. He saw
  cattle, horses and finally a man engaged in building a fence. If Dale had
  encountered an individual laboring this way in any other locality he would
  have thought him a homesteader. It was indeed the most desirable place to
  homestead and ranch on a small scale that Dale had ever seen in his hunting
  trips.</p>

  <p>The man saw Dale just about as quickly as Dale had seen him. Riding by the
  cabin, where a buxom woman and some children peeped out fearfully, Dale
  approached the man. He appeared to be a sturdy, thickset farmer, bearded and
  sharp-eyed. He walked forward a few steps and stopped significantly near a
  shiny rifle leaning against the fence. When Dale got close enough, he
  recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Rogers, you son-of-a-gun! What're you doin' down here?"</p>

  <p>"Brittenham! By all thet's strange. I might ask you the same," was the
  hearty reply, as he offered a horny hand. Two years before, Dale had made the
  acquaintance of Rogers back in the Sawtooth range.</p>

  <p>"When'd you leave Camus Creek?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"This spring, fine place thet. But too cold. I was snowed in all winter.
  Sold out to a Mormon."</p>

  <p>"How'd you happen to locate in here?"</p>

  <p>"Just by accident. I went to Bannock, an' from there to Halsey. Liked thet
  range country. But I wanted to be high, where I could hunt an' trap as well
  as homestead. One day I hit the trail leadin' in here. An' you bet I located
  pronto."</p>

  <p>"Before ridin' out in the big valley?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I saw it. What a range! This was big enough for me. If I'm not
  run out, I'll get rich here in five years."</p>

  <p>"Then you located before you found out you had neighbors?"</p>

  <p>"What do you know about them?" queried Rogers, giving Dale a speculative
  glance.</p>

  <p>"I know enough."</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, I hope to heaven you're not in thet outfit."</p>

  <p>"No. An' I hope the same of you. Have you got wise yet to Mason's way of
  operatin'?"</p>

  <p>"Mason! You don't mean the rancher an' horse trader Bill Mason?"</p>

  <p>"So help me! Big Bill&mdash;the biggest horse thief in this country."</p>

  <p>"If thet's true, who can a man trust?"</p>

  <p>"It's true, Rogers, as you can find out for yourself by watchin'. Mason
  runs a big outfit. They split. One operates in Idaho, the other in Montana.
  They drive the stolen horses up here an' switch men an' herds. They sell the
  Montana stock over in Idaho an' the Idaho stock over on the Montana
  ranges."</p>

  <p>"Hell you say! Big idee an' sure a bold one. I savvy now why these men
  politely told me to pull up stakes an' leave. But I had my cabin up an' my
  family here before they found out I'd located. Then I refused to budge. Reed,
  the boss of the outfit, rode down again last week. Offered to buy me out. I
  thought thet strange. But he didn't offer much, so I refused to sell. He said
  his boss didn't want any homesteaders in here."</p>

  <p>"Rogers, they'll drive you out or kill you," said Dale.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it. They're bluffin'. If they murdered me, it'd bring
  attention to this place. Nobody knows of it. I haven't told about it yet. My
  wife would, though, if they harmed me."</p>

  <p>"This gang wouldn't hesitate to put you all out of the way. They just
  don't take you seriously yet. Think they can scare you out."</p>

  <p>"Not me! Brittenham, how'd you come to know about this horse stealin' an'
  to find this hole?"</p>

  <p>Dale told him about the theft of the Watrous thoroughbreds, how he had
  trailed the robbers up the mountain, what happened there and lastly about the
  big raid that followed hard the same day.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, Rogers. I got blamed for bein' the scout member of Mason's
  outfit. It made me sore. I left Salmon in a hurry, believe me. My aim in
  findin' this hole is to organize a big posse of cowboys an' break up Mason's
  gang."</p>

  <p>"Humph! You ain't aimin' to do much atall."</p>

  <p>"It'll be a job. There's no tellin' how many outfits Mason runs. It's a
  good bet that his ranch outfit is honest an' don't suspect he's a horse
  thief. I'll bet he steals his own horses. If I can raise a hard-fightin'
  bunch an' corral Mason's gang all here in this hole...To catch them
  here&mdash;that's the trick. I'd reckon they'll be stragglin' in soon. It
  doesn't take long to sell a bunch of good horses. Then they'd hide here,
  gamblin' an' livin' fat until time for another raid...Rogers, breakin' up
  this outfit is important to you. How'd you like to help me?"</p>

  <p>"What could I do? Remember I'm handicapped with a wife an' two kids."</p>

  <p>"No fightin' an' no risk for you. I'd plan for you to watch the valley,
  and have some kind of signs I could see from the rim to tell me when the gang
  is here."</p>

  <p>"Get down an' come in," replied the homesteader soberly. "We'll talk it
  over."</p>

  <p>"I'll stop a little while. But I mustn't lose time."</p>

  <p>"Come set on the porch. Meet the wife an' have a bite to eat...Brittenham,
  I think I'll agree to help you. As for signs... There. It's the only place on
  the rim from which you can see my valley an' cabin. I've a big white cowhide
  thet I could throw over the fence. You could see it much farther than thet.
  If you did see it, you'd know the gang was here."</p>

  <p>"Just the trick, Rogers. An' no risk to you," replied Dale with
  satisfaction. He unsaddled Hoofs and let him free on the rich grass. Then he
  accompanied Rogers to the cabin, where he spent a restful hour. When he left,
  Rogers walked with him to the trail. They understood one another and were in
  accord on the plan to break up Mason's band. Dale climbed on foot to the rim,
  his horse following, and then rode east to the point designated by the
  homesteader. Rogers watched for him and waved.</p>

  <p>Across the canyon Dale located a curve in the wall which partly enclosed a
  large area black with horses. He saw cattle, too, and extensive gardens, and
  far up among the trees yellow cabins amidst the green. He rode back to
  Rogers's trail and headed for Bannock, keen and grim over his project.</p>

  <p>The trail zigzagged gradually down toward lower country. Dale was always
  vigilant. No moving object escaped him. But there was a singular dearth of
  life along this scantily timbered eastern mountain slope. Toward late
  afternoon he found himself in broken country again, where the trail wound
  between foothills. It was dark when he rode into Banhock.</p>

  <p>This town, like Salmon, was in the heyday of its productivity. And it was
  considerably larger. Gold and silver mining were its main assets, but there
  was some cattle trade, and extensive business in horses, and the providing of
  supplies for the many camps in the hills. Gambling halls of the period, with
  all their manifest and hidden evils, flourished flagrantly.</p>

  <p>A miner directed Dale to a stable, where he left his horse. Here he
  inquired about his Indian friend Nalook. Then he went uptown to find a
  restaurant. He did not expect to meet anyone who knew him unless it was the
  Indian. Later that contingency would have to be reckoned with. Dale soon
  found a place to eat. Next to him at the lunch counter sat a red-faced cowboy
  who answered his greeting civilly.</p>

  <p>"How's the hash here?" asked Dale.</p>

  <p>"Fair to middlin'...Stranger hereabouts, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. I hail from the Snake River country."</p>

  <p>"I see you're a range rider, but no cowman."</p>

  <p>"You're a good guesser. My job is horses."</p>

  <p>"Bronco buster, I'll bet."</p>

  <p>"Nope. But I can an' do break wild horses."</p>

  <p>"Reckon you're on your way to Halsey. There's a big sale of Idaho stock
  there tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Idaho horses. You don't say?" ejaculated Dale, pretending surprise. "I
  hadn't heard of it."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I reckon it wasn't advertised over your way," replied the cowboy
  with a short laugh. "An' when you buy fine horses at half their value, you
  don't ask questions."</p>

  <p>"Cowboy, you said a lot. I'm goin' to have a look at that bunch. How far
  to Halsey?"</p>

  <p>"Two hours for you, if you stretch leather. It takes a buckboard
  four."</p>

  <p>Dale then attended to the business of eating, but that did not keep his
  mind from functioning actively. It staggered him to think that it was
  possible Mason had the brazen nerve to sell stolen Idaho horses not a hundred
  miles across the line.</p>

  <p>"How about buckin' the tiger?" asked Dale's acquaintance as they went out
  into the street.</p>

  <p>"No gamblin' for me, cowboy. I like to look on, though, when there's some
  big bettin'."</p>

  <p>"I seen a game today. Poker. Big Bill Mason won ten thousand at Steen's.
  You should have heard him roar. `Thet pays up for the bunch of horses stole
  from me the other day.'"</p>

  <p>"Who's Big Bill Mason?" asked Dale innocently.</p>

  <p>"Wal, he's about the whole cheese down Halsey way. Got his hand in most
  everythin'. I rode for him a spell."</p>

  <p>"Does he deal much in horses?"</p>

  <p>"Not so much as with cattle. But he always runs four or five hundred haid
  on his ranch."</p>

  <p>Presently Dale parted from the cowboy and strolled along the dimly lighted
  street, peering into the noisy saloons, halting near groups of men, and
  listening. He spent a couple of hours that way, here and there picking up
  bits of talk. No mention of the big steal of Idaho horses came to Dale's
  ears. Still, with a daily stagecoach between the towns it was hardly
  conceivable that some news had not sifted through to Bannock.</p>

  <p>Before leaving town, Dale bought a new shirt and a scarf. He slept that
  night in the barn where he had his horse put up. A pile of hay made a better
  bed than Dale was used to. But for a disturbing dream about Edith Watrous, in
  which she visited him in jail, he slept well. Next morning he shaved and
  donned his new garments, after which he went into the town for breakfast. He
  was wary this morning. Early though the hour, the street was dotted with
  vehicles, and a motley string of pedestrians passed to and fro on the
  sidewalks.</p>

  <p>Dale had a leisurely and ample breakfast, after which he strolled in the
  street to the largest store and entered, trying to remember what it was that
  he had wanted to purchase.</p>

  <p>"Dale!" A voice transfixed him. He looked up to be confronted by Edith
  Watrous.</p>

  <p>A red-cheeked, comely young woman accompanied Edith, and looked at Dale
  with bright, curious eyes. He stammered confusedly in answer to Edith's
  greeting.</p>

  <p>"Susan, this is my friend Dale Brittenham." Edith introduced him
  hurriedly. "Dale...Miss Bradford...I came over here to visit Susan."</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, Miss," returned Dale, doffing his sombrero
  awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"I've heard about you," said the girl, smiling at Dale. But evidently she
  saw something was amiss, for she turned to Edith and said, "You'll want to
  talk, I'll do my buying."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I want to talk to my friend Dale Brittenham," agreed Edith
  seriously. Her desire to emphasize the word "friend" could not be mistaken.
  She drew him away from the entrance of the store to a more secluded space.
  Then: "Dale!" Her voice was low and full of suppressed emotion. Pale, and
  with eyes dark with scorn and sorrow, she faced him.</p>

  <p>"How'd you come over here?" he queried, regaining his coolness.</p>

  <p>"Nalook drove me in the buckboard. He returned to the ranch after you
  left. We got here last night."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you had the bad luck to run into me."</p>

  <p>"Not bad luck, Dale. I followed you. I was certain you'd come here.
  There's no other town to go to."</p>

  <p>"Followed me? Edith, what for?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know yet...After you left, I had a quarrel with Leale and
  Dad. I upbraided them for not standing by you. I swore you couldn't be a
  horse thief. I declared you were furious&mdash;that in your bitterness you
  just helped them to think badly of you."</p>

  <p>"How could they help that when I admitted my...my guilt?"</p>

  <p>"They couldn't&mdash;but <i>I</i> could...Dale, I know you. If you had
  been a real thief, you'd never...never have told me you...you loved me that
  last terrible moment. You couldn't. You wanted me to know. You looked
  bitter...hard...wretched. There was nothing low-down or treacherous about
  you."</p>

  <p>"Edith, there you're wrong," returned Dale hoarsely. "For there is."</p>

  <p>"Dale, don't kill my faith in you...Don't kill something I'm...I'm
  afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's true&mdash;to my shame an' regret."</p>

  <p>"Oh!...So that's why you never made love to me like the other boys? You
  were man enough for that, at least. I'm indebted to you. But I'll tell you
  what I've found out. If you had been the splendid fellow I thought
  you&mdash;and if you'd had sense enough to tell me sooner that you loved
  me&mdash;well...there was no one I liked better, Dale Brittenham."</p>

  <p>"My God! Edith, don't&mdash;I beg you&mdash;don't say that now," implored
  Dale in passionate sadness.</p>

  <p>"I care a great deal for Leale Hildrith. But it was Dad's match. I told
  Leale so. I would probably have come to it of my own accord in time.
  Yesterday we had a quarrel. He made an awful fuss about my leaving home, so I
  slipped away unseen. But I'll bet he's on the way here right now."</p>

  <p>"I hope he comes after you," said Dale, bewildered and wrenched by this
  disclosure.</p>

  <p>"He'd better not...Never mind him, Dale. You've hurt me. Perhaps I
  deserved it. For I have been selfish and vain with my friends. To find out
  you're a...a thief...Oh, I hate you for making me believe it! It's just
  sickening. But you can't&mdash;you simply can't have become callous. You
  always had queer notions about range horses being free. There are no fences
  in parts of Idaho...Oh, see how I make excuses for you! Dale, promise me you
  will never help to steal another horse so long as you live."</p>

  <p>Dale longed to fall upon his knees to her and tell her the truth. She was
  betraying more than she knew. He had seen her audacious and winning
  innumerable times, and often angry, and once eloquent, but never so tragic
  and beautiful as now. It almost broke down his will. He had to pull his hand
  from hers&mdash;to force a hateful stand utterly foreign to his nature.</p>

  <p>"Edith, I won't lie to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure of that," she retorted, her eyes piercing him. They had an
  intense transparancy through which her thought, her doubt, shone like a
  gleam.</p>

  <p>"Nope. I can't promise. My old wild-horse business is about played out.
  I've got to live."</p>

  <p>"Dale, I'll give...lend you money, so you can go away far and begin all
  over again. Please, Dale?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, lady," he returned, trying to be laconic. "Sure I couldn't think
  of that."</p>

  <p>"You're so strange&mdash;so different. You didn't used to be like
  this...Dale, is it my fault you went to the bad?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" he exclaimed in sudden heat. "Reckon it was just in me."</p>

  <p>"Swear you're not lying to me."</p>

  <p>"All right, I swear."</p>

  <p>"If I believed I was to blame, I'd follow you and make you honest. I ought
  to do it anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Edith, I'm sure glad you needn't go to such extremes. You can't save a
  bad egg."</p>

  <p>"Oh...Dale..." She was about to yield further to her poignant mood when
  her friend returned.</p>

  <p>"Edie, I'd have stayed away longer," said Susan, her eyes upon them. "Only
  if we're going to Halsey, we must rustle pronto."</p>

  <p>"Edith, are you drivin' over there?" asked Dale quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Susan's brother is coming. There's a big horse sale on. I'm just
  curious to see if there will be any of Dad's horses there."</p>

  <p>"I'm curious about that, too," admitted Dale soberly. "Good-by,
  Edith...Miss Bradford, glad to meet you, an' good-by."</p>

  <p>Dale strode swiftly out of the store, though Edith's call acted upon him
  like a magnet. Once outside, with restraint gone, he fell in a torment. He
  could not think coherently, let alone reason. That madcap girl, fully
  aroused, might be capable of anything. Dale suffered anguish as he rushed
  down the street and to the outskirts of town, where he saddled his horse and
  rode away down the slope to the east.</p>

  <p>There were both horsemen and vehicles going in the same direction, which
  he surmised was toward Halsey. Dale urged his mount ahead of them and then
  settled down to a steady sharp gait. He made no note of time, or the passing
  country. Long before noon, he rode into Halsey.</p>

  <p>The town appeared to be deserted, except for clerks in stores, bartenders
  at the doors of saloons, and a few loungers. Only two vehicles showed down
  the length of the long street. Dale did not need to ask why, but he did ask
  to be directed to the horse fair. He was not surprised to find a couple of
  hundred people, mostly men, congregated at the edge of town, where in an open
  green field several score of horses, guarded by mounted riders, grazed and
  bunched in front of the spectators. Almost the first horse he looked at twice
  proved to be one wearing the Watrous brand.</p>

  <p>Then Dale had a keen eye for that drove of horses and especially the
  horsemen. In a country where all men packed guns, their being armed did not
  mean anything to casual observers. Nevertheless, to Dale it was significant.
  They looked to him to be a seasoned outfit of hard riders. He hid Hoofs in
  the background and sauntered over toward the center of activities.</p>

  <p>"Where's this stock from?" he asked one of a group of three men, evidently
  ranchers, who were bystanders like himself.</p>

  <p>"Idaho. Snake River range."</p>

  <p>"Sure some fine saddle hosses," went on Dale. "What they sellin' for?"</p>

  <p>"None under a hundred dollars. An' goin' like hotcakes."</p>

  <p>"Who's the hoss dealer?"</p>

  <p>"Ed Reed. Hails from Twin Falls."</p>

  <p>"Ahuh. Gentlemen, I'm a stranger in these parts," said Dale deliberately.
  "I hear there's no end of hoss business goin' on&mdash;hoss sellin', hoss
  buyin', hoss tradin'...and hoss stealin'."</p>

  <p>"Wal, this is a hoss country," spoke up another of the trio dryly as he
  looked Dale up and down. Dale's cool speech had struck them
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"You all got the earmarks of range men," Dale continued curtly. "I'd ask,
  without 'pearin' too inquisitive, if any one of you has lost stock
  lately?"</p>

  <p>There followed a moment of silence, in which the three exchanged glances
  and instinctively edged close together.</p>

  <p>"Wal, stranger. I reckon thet's a fair question," replied the eldest, a
  gray-haired, keen-eyed Westerner. "Some of us ranchers down in the range have
  been hit hard lately."</p>

  <p>"By what? Fire, flood, blizzard, drought&mdash;or hoss thieves?"</p>

  <p>"I'd reckon thet last, stranger. But don't forget you said it."</p>

  <p>"Fine free country, this, where a range man can't talk right out,"
  rejoined Dale caustically. "I'll tell you why. You don't know who the hoss
  thieves are. An' particular, their chief. He might be one of your respectable
  rancher neighbors."</p>

  <p>"Stranger, you got as sharp a tongue as eye," returned the third member of
  the group. "What's your name an' what's your game?"</p>

  <p>"Brittenham. I'm a wild-horse hunter from the Snake River Basin. My game
  is to get three or four tough cowboy outfits together."</p>

  <p>"Wal, thet oughtn't be hard to do in this country, if you had reason,"
  returned the rancher, his eyes narrowing. Dale knew he did not need to tell
  these men that the drove of horses before them had been stolen.</p>

  <p>"I'll look you up after the sale," he concluded.</p>

  <p>"My name's Strickland. We'll sure be on the lookout for you."</p>

  <p>The three moved on toward the little crowd near the horses at that moment
  under inspection. "Jim, if we're goin' to buy some stock, we've got to
  hustle," remarked one.</p>

  <p>Dale sauntered away to get a good look at the main drove of horses. When
  he recognized Dusty Dan, a superb bay that he had actually straddled himself,
  a bursting gush of hot blood burned through his veins. Deliberately he
  stepped closer, until he was halted by one of the mounted guards.</p>

  <p>"Whar you goin', cowboy?" demanded this individual, a powerful rider of
  mature years, clad in greasy leather chaps and dusty blouse. He had a bearded
  visage and deep-set eyes, gleaming under a black sombrero pulled well
  down.</p>

  <p>"I'm lookin' for my hoss," replied Dale mildly.</p>

  <p>The guard gave a slight start, barely perceptible.</p>

  <p>"Wal, do you see him?" he queried insolently.</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"What kind of hoss, cowboy?"</p>

  <p>"He's a black with white face. Wearin' a W brand like that bay there. He'd
  stand out in that bunch like a silver dollar in a fog."</p>

  <p>"Wal, he ain't hyar, an' you can mosey back."</p>

  <p>"Hell you say," retorted Dale, changing his demeanor in a flash. "These
  horses are on inspection...an' see here, Mr. Leather Pants, don't tell
  <i>me</i> to mosey anywhere."</p>

  <p>Another guard, a lean, sallow-faced man, rode up to query, "Who's this
  guy, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Took him for a smart-alec cowboy."</p>

  <p>"You took me wrong, you Montana buckaroos," interposed Dale, cool and
  caustic. "I'll mosey around an' see if I can pick out a big black hoss with
  the W brand."</p>

  <p>Dale strode on, but he heard the guard called Jim mutter to his companion,
  "Tip Reed off." Presently Dale turned in time to see the rider bend from his
  saddle to speak in the ear of a tall dark man. Thus Dale identified Ed Reed,
  and without making his action marked, he retraced his steps. On his way he
  distinguished more W brands and recognized more Watrous horses.</p>

  <p>Joining the group of buyers, Dale looked on from behind. After one survey
  of Big Bill Mason's right-hand man, Dale estimated him to be a keen, suave
  villain whose job was to talk, but who would shoot on the slightest
  provocation.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, we won't haggle over a few dollars," Reed was saying
  blandly as he waved a hairy brown hand. "Step up and make your offers. These
  horses have got to go."</p>

  <p>Then buying took on a brisk impetus. During the next quarter of an hour a
  dozen and more horses were bought and led away, among them Dusty Dan. That
  left only seven animals, one of which was the white-faced black Dale had
  spoken about to the guard, but had not actually seen.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, here's the pick of the bunch," spoke up Reed. "Eight years
  old. Sound as a rock. His sire was blooded stock. I forget the name. What'll
  you offer?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred fifty," replied a young man eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That's a start. Bid up, gentlemen. This black is gentle, fast, wonderful
  gait. A single-footer. You see how he stacks up.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred," called Dale, who meant to outbid any other buyers, take
  the horse and refuse to pay.</p>

  <p>"Come on. Don't you Montana men know horseflesh when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Reed halted with a violent start and the flare of his eyes indicated
  newcomers. Dale wheeled with a guess that he verified in the sight of Edith
  Watrous and Leale Hildrith, with another couple behind them. He also saw
  Nalook, the Indian, at the driver's seat of the buckboard. Hildrith's face
  betrayed excessive emotion under control. He tried to hold Edith back. But,
  resolute and pale, she repelled him and came on. Dale turned swiftly so as
  not to escape Reed's reaction to this no-doubt-astounding and dangerous
  interruption. Dale was treated to an extraordinary expression of fury and
  jealousy. It passed from Reed's dark glance and dark face as swiftly as it
  had come.</p>

  <p>Dale disliked the situation that he saw imminent. There were ten in Reed's
  gang&mdash;somber, dark-browed men, whom it was only necessary for Dale to
  scrutinize once to gauge their status. On the other hand, the majority of
  spectators and buyers were not armed. Dale realized that he had to change his
  mind, now that Edith was there. To start a fight would be foolhardy and
  precarious.</p>

  <p>The girl had fire in her eyes as she addressed the little group.</p>

  <p>"Who's boss here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am, Miss...Ed Reed, at your service." Removing his sombrero, he made
  her a gallant bow, his face strong and not unhandsome in a bold way.
  Certainly his gaze was one of unconcealed admiration.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Reed, that black horse with the white face belongs to me," declared
  Edith imperiously.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" replied Reed, exhibiting apparently genuine surprise. "And
  who're you, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Edith Watrous. Jim Watrous is my father."</p>

  <p>"Pleased to meet you...You'll excuse me, Miss Watrous, if I ask for proof
  that this black is yours."</p>

  <p>Edith came around so that the horse could see her, and she spoke to him.
  "Dick, old boy, don't you know me?"</p>

  <p>The black pounded the ground, and with a snort jerked the halter from the
  man who held him. Whinnying, he came to Edith, his fine eyes soft, and he
  pressed his nose into her hands.</p>

  <p>"There!...Isn't that sufficient?" asked Edith.</p>

  <p>Reed had looked on with feigned amusement. Dale gauged him as deep and
  resourceful.</p>

  <p>"Sam, fetch my hoss. I'm tired standing and I reckon this lady has queered
  us for other buyers."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Reed, I'm taking my horse whether you like it or not," declared Edith
  forcefully.</p>

  <p>"But, Miss Watrous, you can't do that. You haven't proved to me he belongs
  to you. I've seen many fine horses that'd come to a woman."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get Dick?"</p>

  <p>"I bought him along with the other W-brand horses."</p>

  <p>"From whom?" queried Edith derisively.</p>

  <p>"John Williams. He's a big breeder in horses. His ranch is on the Snake
  River. I daresay your father knows him."</p>

  <p>Dale stepped out in front. "Reed, there's no horse breeder on the Snake
  River," he said.</p>

  <p>The horse thief coolly mounted a superb bay that had been led up, and then
  gazed sardonically from Edith to Dale. "Where do you come in?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Brittenham. I'm a wild-horse hunter. I know every foot of
  range in the Snake between the falls an' the foothills."</p>

  <p>"Williams's ranch is way up in the foothills," rejoined Reed easily. He
  had not exactly made a perceptible sign to his men, but they had closed in,
  and two of them slipped out of their saddles. Dale could not watch them and
  Reed at the same time. He grew uneasy. These thieves, with their crafty and
  bold leader, were masters of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Lady, I hate to be rude, but you must let go that halter," said Reed with
  an edge on his voice.</p>

  <p>"I won't."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll have to be rude. Sam, take that rope away from her."</p>

  <p>"Leale, say something, can't you? What kind of a man are you, anyway?"
  cried Edith, turning in angry amazement to her fianc.</p>

  <p>"What can I say?" asked Hildrith, spreading wide his hands, as if
  helpless. His visage at the moment was not prepossessing.</p>

  <p>"What! Why, tell him you know this is my horse."</p>

  <p>Reed let out a laugh that had bitter satisfaction as well as irony in it.
  Dale had to admit that the predicament for Hildrith looked extremely
  serious.</p>

  <p>"Reed, if Miss Watrous says it's her horse, you can rely on her word,"
  replied the pallid Hildrith.</p>

  <p>"I'd take no woman's word," returned the leader.</p>

  <p>"Dale, you know it's my horse. You've ridden him. If you're not a liar,
  Mr. Reed knows you as well as you know me."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, lady," interposed Reed. "I never saw your wild-horse-hunter
  champion in my life. If he claims to know me, he is a liar."</p>

  <p>"Dale!" Edith transfixed him with soul-searching eyes.</p>

  <p>"I reckon you forget, Reed. Or you just won't own up to knowin' me. That's
  no matter...But the horse belongs to Miss Watrous. I've ridden him. I've seen
  him at the Watrous ranch every day or so for years."</p>

  <p>"Brittenham. Is that what you call yourself? I'd lie for her, too. She's
  one grand girl. But she can't rob me of this horse."</p>

  <p>"Rob! That's funny, Mr. Reed," exclaimed Edith hotly. "You're the robber!
  I'll bet Dick against two bits that <i>you're</i> the leader of this
  horse-thief gang."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't shoot a girl, much less such a pretty and tantalizing one
  as you. But don't sat that again. I might forget my manners."</p>

  <p>"You brazen fellow!" cried Edith, probably as much incensed by his
  undisguised and bold gaze as by his threat. "I not only think you're a horse
  thief, but I call you one!"</p>

  <p>"All right. You can't be bluffed, Edith," he returned grimly. "You've sure
  got nerve. But you'll be sorry, if it's the last trick I pull on this
  range."</p>

  <p>"Edith, get away from here," ordered Hildrith huskily, and he plucked at
  her with shaking hands. "Let go that halter."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Edith, fight in every line of her face and form, and as she
  backed away from Hildrith, she inadvertently drew nearer to Reed.</p>

  <p>"But you don't realize who...what this man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you?" she flashed piercingly.</p>

  <p>Dale groaned in spirit. This was the end of Leale Hildrith. The girl was
  as keen as a whip, and bristling with suspicion. The unfortunate man almost
  cringed before her. Then Reed rasped out, <i>"Rustle, there!"</i></p>

  <p>At the instant that Reed's ally Sam jerked the halter out of Edith's hand,
  Dale felt the hard prod of a gun against his back. "Put 'em up, Britty,"
  called a surly voice. Dale lost no time getting his hands above his head, and
  he cursed under his breath for his haste and impetuosity. He was relieved of
  his gun. Then the pressure on his back ceased.</p>

  <p>Reed reached down to lay a powerful left hand on Edith's arm.</p>

  <p>"Let go!" the girl burst our angrily, and she struggled to free herself.
  "Oh...you hurt me! Stop, you ruffian."</p>

  <p>"Stand still, girl!" ordered Reed, trying to hold her and the spirited
  horse. "He'll step on you&mdash;crush your foot."</p>

  <p>"Ah-h!" screamed Edith in agony, and she ceased her violent exertion to
  stand limp, holding up one foot. The red receded from her face.</p>

  <p>"Take your hand off her," shouted Hildrith, reaching for a gun that was
  not there.</p>

  <p>"Is that your stand, Hildrith?" queried Reed, cold and hard.</p>

  <p>"What do you...mean?"</p>

  <p>"It's a showdown. This jig is up. Show yellow...or come out with the truth
  before these men. Don't leave it to me."</p>

  <p>"Are you drunk...or crazy?" screamed Hildrith, beside himself. He did not
  grasp Reed's deadly intent, whatever his scheme was. He thought his one hope
  was to play his accustomed part. Yet he suspected a move that made him
  frantic. "Let her go!...Damn your black hide&mdash;let her go!"</p>

  <p>"Black, but not yellow, you traitor!" wrung out Reed as he leveled a gun
  at Hildrith. "We'll see what the boss says to this...Rustle, or I'll kill
  you. I'd like to do it. But you're not my man...Get over there quick. Put him
  on a horse, men, and get going. Sam, up with her!"</p>

  <p>Before Dale could have moved, even if he had been able to accomplish
  anything, unarmed as he was, the man seized Edith and threw her up on Reed's
  horse, where despite her struggles and cries he jammed her down in the saddle
  in front of Reed.</p>

  <p>As Reed wheeled away, looking back with menacing gun, the spectators burst
  into a loud roar. Sam dragged the black far enough to be able to leap astride
  his own horse and spur away, pulling his captive into his stride. The other
  men, ahead of Reed, drove the unsaddled horses out in front. The swiftness
  and precision of the whole gang left the crowd stunned. They raced out across
  the open range, headed for the foothills. Edith's pealing cry came floating
  back.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">DALE was the first to recover from the swift raw shock of
  the situation. All around him milled an excited crowd. Most of them did not
  grasp the significance of the sudden exodus of the horse dealers until they
  were out of sight. Dale, nearly frantic, lost no time in finding
  Strickland.</p>

  <p>"Reckon-I needn't waste time now convincin' you there are some horse
  thieves in this neck of the woods," he spat out sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, I'm plumb beat," replied the rancher, and he looked it. "In
  my ten years on this range I never saw the like of that...My Gawd! What an
  impudent rascal! To grab the Watrous girl right under our noses! Not a shot
  fired!"</p>

  <p>"Don't rub it in," growled Dale. "I had to watch Reed. His man got the
  drop on me. A lot of slick hombres. An' that's not sayin' half."</p>

  <p>"We'll hang every damn one of them," shouted Strickland harshly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. After we save the girl...Step aside here with me. Fetch those men
  you had...Come, both of you...Now, Strickland, this is stern business. We've
  not a minute to waste. I want a bunch of hard-ridin' cowboys here
  <i>pronto.</i> Figure quick now, while I get my horse an' find that
  Indian."</p>

  <p>Dale ran into the lithe, dark, buckskin-clad Nalook as he raced for his
  horse. This Indian had no equal as a tracker in Idaho.</p>

  <p>"Boss, you go me," Nalook said in his low voice, with a jerk of his thumb
  toward the foothills. Apparently the Indian had witnessed the whole
  action.</p>

  <p>"Rustle, Nalook. Borrow a horse an' guns. I've got grub."</p>

  <p>Dale hurried back, leading Hoofs. Reaching Strickland and his friends, he
  halted with them and waited, meanwhile taking his extra guns out of his
  pack.</p>

  <p>"I can have a posse right here in thirty minutes," declared the
  rancher.</p>

  <p>"Good. But I won't wait. The Indian here will go with me. We'll leave a
  trail they can follow on the run. Tracks an' broken brush."</p>

  <p>"I can get thirty or more cowboys here in six hours."</p>

  <p>"Better. Tell them the same."</p>

  <p>Nalook appeared at his elbow. "Boss, me no find hoss."</p>

  <p>"Strickland, borrow a horse for this Indian. I'll need him."</p>

  <p>"Joe, go with the Indian," said Strickland. "Get him horse and outfit if
  you have to buy it."</p>

  <p>"You men listen and hold your breath," whispered Dale. "This Reed outfit
  is only one of several. Their boss is Big Bill Mason."</p>

  <p>The ranchers were beyond surprise or shock. Strickland snapped his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"That accounts. Dale, I'll tell you something. Mason got back to Halsey
  last night from Bannock, he said. He was not himself. This morning he sold
  his ranch&mdash;gave it away, almost&mdash;to Jeff Wheaton. He told Wheaton
  he was leaving Montana."</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"Must have left early. You can bet something was up for him to miss a
  horse sale."</p>

  <p>"When did Reed's outfit arrive?"</p>

  <p>"Just before noon."</p>

  <p>"Here's what has happened," Dale calculated audibly. "Mason must have
  learned that Stafford an' Watrous was sendin' a big posse out on the trail of
  Mason's Idaho outfit."</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, if this Ed Reed didn't call Hildrith to show his hand for or
  against that outfit, then I'm plumb deaf."</p>

  <p>"It looked like it," admitted Dale gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I thought he was going to kill Hildrith."</p>

  <p>"So did I. There's bad blood between them."</p>

  <p>"Hildrith has had dealings of some kind with Reed. Remember how Reed spit
  out, `We'll see what the boss says about this...I'd like to kill you'?
  Brittenham, I'd say Hildrith has fooled Watrous and his daughter, and this
  Mason outfit also.."</p>

  <p>Dale was saved from a reply by the approach of Nalook, mounted on a
  doughty mustang. He carried a carbine and wore a brass-studded belt with two
  guns.</p>

  <p>"We're off, Strickland," cried Dale, kicking his stirrup straight and
  mounting. "Hurry your posse an' outfits. Pack light, an' rustle's the
  word."</p>

  <p>Once out of the circle of curious onlookers, Dale told Nalook to take the
  horse thieves' trail and travel. The Indian pointed toward the foothills.</p>

  <p>"Me know trail. Big hole. Indian live there long time. Nalook's people
  know hoss thieves."</p>

  <p>"I've been there, Nalook. Did you know Bill Mason was chief of that
  outfit?"</p>

  <p>"No sure. See him sometime. Like beaver. Hard see."</p>

  <p>"We'd better not shortcut. Sure Reed will make for the hideout hole. But
  he'll camp on the way."</p>

  <p>"No far. Be there sundown."</p>

  <p>"Is it that close from this side?...All the better. Lead on, Nalook. When
  we hit the brush, we want to be close on Reed's heels."</p>

  <p>The Indian followed Reed's tracks at a lope. They led off the grassy
  lowland toward the hills. Ten miles or more down on the range to the east
  Dale spied a ranch, which Nalook said was Mason's. At that distance it did
  not look pretentious. A flat-topped ranch house, a few sheds and corrals, and
  a few cattle dotting the grassy range inclined Dale to the conviction that
  this place of Mason's had served as a blind to his real activities.</p>

  <p>Soon Nalook led off the rangeland into the foothills. Reed's trail could
  have been followed in the dark. It wound through ravines and hollows between
  hills that soon grew high and wooded on top. The dry wash gave place to pools
  of water here and there, and at last a running brook, lined by grass and
  willows growing green and luxuriant.</p>

  <p>At length a mountain slope confronted the trackers. Here the trail left
  the watercourse and took a slant up the long incline. Dale sighted no old
  hoofmarks and concluded that Reed was making a shortcut to the rendezvous. At
  intervals Dale broke branches on the willows and brush he passed, and let
  them hang down, plainly visible to a keen eye. Rocks and brush, cactus and
  scrub oak, grew increasingly manifest, and led to the cedars, which in turn
  yielded to the evergreens.</p>

  <p>It was about midafternoon when they surmounted the first bench of the
  mountain. With a posse from Halsey possibly only a half-hour behind, Dale
  slowed up the Indian. Reed's tracks were fresh in the red bare ground. Far
  across the plateau the belt of pines showed black, and the gray rock ridges
  stood up. Somewhere in that big rough country hid the thieves'
  stronghold.</p>

  <p>"Foller more no good," said Nalook, and left Reed's tracks for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>Dale made no comment. But he fell to hard pondering. Reed, bold outlaw
  that he was, would this time expect pursuit and fight, if he stayed in the
  country. His abducting the girl had been a desperate unconsidered impulse,
  prompted by her beauty, or by desire for revenge on Hildrith, or possibly to
  hold her for ransom, or all of these together. No doubt he knew this easy
  game was up for Mason. He had said as much to Hildrith. It was not
  conceivable to Dale that Reed would stay in the country if Mason was leaving.
  They had made their big stake.</p>

  <p>Nalook waited for Dale on the summit of a ridge. "Ugh!" he said, and
  pointed.</p>

  <p>They had emerged near the head of a valley that bisected the foothills and
  opened out upon the range, dim and hazy below. Dale heard running water. He
  saw the white flags of deer in the green brush. It was a wild and quiet
  scene.</p>

  <p>"Mason trail come here," said the Indian, with an expressive gesture
  downward.</p>

  <p>Then he led on, keeping to the height of slope; and once over that,
  entered rough and thicketed land that impeded their progress. In many places
  the soft red and yellow earth gave way to stone, worn to every conceivable
  shape. There were hollows and upstanding grotesque slabs and cones, and long
  flat stretches, worn uneven by erosion. Evergreens and sage and dwarf cedars
  found lodgment in holes. When they crossed this area to climb higher and
  reach a plateau, the sun was setting gold over the black mountain heights.
  Dale recognized the same conformation of earth and rock that he had found on
  the south side of the robbers' gorge. Nalook's slow progress and caution
  brought the tight cold stretch to Dale's skin. They were nearing their
  objective.</p>

  <p>At length the Indian got off his horse and tied it behind a clump of
  evergreens. Dale followed suit. They drew their rifles.</p>

  <p>"We look&mdash;see. Mebbe come back," whispered Nalook. He glided on
  without the slightest sound or movement of foliage, Dale endeavoring to
  follow his example. After traversing half a mile in a circuitous route, he
  halted and put a finger to his nose. "Smell smoke. Tobac."</p>

  <p>But Dale could not catch the scent. Not long afterward, however, he made
  out the peculiar emptiness behind a line of evergreens, and this marked the
  void they were seeking. They kept on at a snail's pace.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Nalook halted and put a hand back to stop Dale. He could not
  crouch much lower. Warily he pointed over the fringe of low evergreens to a
  pile of gray rocks. On the summit sat a man with his back to the trackers. He
  was gazing intently in the opposite direction. This surely was a guard
  stationed there to spy any pursuers, presumably approaching on the trail.</p>

  <p>"Me shoot him," whispered Nalook.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," whispered Dale in reply, perplexed. "How far to their
  camp?".</p>

  <p>"No hear gun."</p>

  <p>"But there might be another man on watch."</p>

  <p>"Me see."</p>

  <p>The Indian glided away like a snake. How invaluable he was in a perilous
  enterprise like this! Dale sat down to watch and wait. The sun sank and
  shadows gathered under the evergreens. The scout on duty seemed not very
  vigilant. He never turned once to look back. But suddenly he stood up
  guardedly and thrust his rifle forward. He took aim and appeared about to
  fire. Then he stiffened strangly, and jerked up as if powerfully propelled.
  Immediately there followed the crack of a rifle. Then the guard swayed and
  fell backward out of sight. Dale heard a low crash and a rattle of rocks.
  Then all was still. He waited. After what seemed a long anxious time, the
  thud of hoofs broke the silence. He sank down, clutching his rifle. But it
  was Nalook coming with the horses.</p>

  <p>"We go quick. Soon night," said the Indian, and led the way toward the
  jumble of rocks. Presently Dale saw a trail as wide as a road. It led down.
  Next he got a glimpse of the gorge. From this end it was more wonderful to
  gaze down into, a magnificent hole, with sunset gilding the opposite wall,
  and purple shadows mantling the caverns, and the lake shining black.</p>

  <p>Viewed from this angle, Mason's rendezvous presented a different and more
  striking spectacle. This north end where Dale stood was a great deal lower
  than the south end, or at least the walls were lower and the whole zigzag
  oval of rims sloped toward him, so that he was looking up at the southern
  escarpments. Yet the floor of the gorge appeared level. From this vantage
  point the caverns and cracks in the walls stood out darkly and mysteriously,
  suggesting hidden places and perhaps unseen exits from this magnificent
  burrow. The deep indentation of the eastern side, where Mason had his camp,
  was not visible from any other point. At that sunset hour a mantle of gold
  and purple hung over the chasm. All about it seemed silent and secretive, a
  wild niche of nature, hollowed out for the protection of men as wild as the
  place. It brooded under the gathering twilight. The walls gleamed dark with a
  forbidding menace.</p>

  <p>Nalook started down, leading his mustang. Then Dale noted that he had a
  gun belt and long silver spurs hung over the pommel of his saddle. He had
  taken time to remove these from the guard he had shot. This trail was open
  and from its zigzag corners Dale caught glimpses of the gorge, and of droves
  of horses. Suddenly he remembered that he had forgotten to break brush and
  otherwise mark their path after they had sheered off Reed's tracks.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" he whispered. The Indian waited. "It's gettin' dark. Strickland's
  posse can't trail us."</p>

  <p>"Ugh. They foller Reed. Big moon. All same day." Thus reassured, Dale
  followed on, grimly fortifying himself to some issue near at hand.</p>

  <p>When they came out into the open valley below, dusk had fallen. Nalook had
  been in that hole before, Dale made certain. He led away from the lake along
  a brook, and let his horse drink. Then he drank himself, and motioned Dale to
  do likewise. He went on then in among scrub-oak trees to a grassy open spot,
  where he halted.</p>

  <p>"Mebbe long fight," he whispered. "I rope hoss." Dale removed saddle and
  bridle from Hoofs and tied him on a long halter.</p>

  <p>"What do?" asked Nalook.</p>

  <p>"Sneak up on them."</p>

  <p>By this time it was dark down in the canyon, though still light above.
  Nalook led out of the trees and, skirting them, kept to the north wall.
  Presently he turned and motioned Dale to lift his feet, one after the other,
  to remove his spurs. The Indian hung them in the crotch of a bush. Scattered
  trees of larger size began to loom up on this higher ground. The great black
  wall stood up rimmed with white stars. Dim lights glimmered through the
  foliage and gradually grew brighter. Nalook might have been a shadow for all
  the sound he made. Intensely keen and vigilant as Dale was, he could not keep
  from swishing the grass or making an occasional rustle in the brush.
  Evidently the Indian did not want to lose time, but he kept cautioning Dale
  with an expressive backward gesture.</p>

  <p>Nalook left the line of timber under the wall and took out into the grove.
  He now advanced more cautiously than ever. Dale thought this guide must have
  the eyes of a night hawk. They passed a dark shack which was open in front
  and had a projecting roof. Two campfires were blazing a hundred yards farther
  on. And a lamp shone through what must have been a window of a cabin.</p>

  <p>Presently the Indian halted. He pointed. Then Dale saw horses and men, and
  he heard gruff voices and the sound of flopping saddles. Some outfit had just
  arrived. Dale wondered if it was Reed's. If so, he had tarried some little
  time after getting down into the gorge.</p>

  <p>"We go look&mdash;see," whispered Nalook in Dale's ear. The Indian seemed
  devoid of fear. He seemed actuated by more than friendship for Dale and
  gratitude to Edith Watrous. He hated someone in that horse-thief gang.</p>

  <p>Dale followed him, growing stern and hard. He could form no idea of what
  to do except get the lay of the land, ascertain if possible what Reed was up
  to, and then go back to the head of the trail and wait for the posse. But he
  well realized the precarious nature of spying on these desperate men. He
  feared, too, that Edith Watrous was in vastly more danger of harm than of
  being held for ransom.</p>

  <p>The campfires lighted up two separate circles, both in front of the
  open-faced shacks. Around the farther one, men were cooking a meal. Dale
  smelled ham and coffee. The second fire had just been kindled and its bright
  blaze showed riders moving about still with chaps on, unsaddling and
  unpacking. Dale pierced the gloom for sight of Edith but failed to locate
  her.</p>

  <p>The Indian sheered away to the right so that a cabin hid the campfires.
  This structure was a real log cabin of some pretensions. Again a lamp shone
  through a square window. Faint streaks of light, too, came from chinks
  between the logs. Dale tried to see through the window, but Nalook led him at
  a wrong angle. Soon they reached the cabin. Dale felt the rough peeled logs.
  Nalook had an ear against the log wall. No sound within! Then the Indian,
  moving with extreme stealth, slipped very slowly along the wall until he came
  to one of the open chinks. Dale suppressed his eagerness. He must absolutely
  move without a sound. But that was easy. Thick grass grew beside the cabin.
  In another tense movement Dale came up with Nalook, who clutched his arm and
  pulled him down.</p>

  <p>There was an aperture between the logs where the mud filling had fallen
  out. Dale applied his eyes to the small crack. His blood leaped at sight of a
  big man sitting at a table. Black-browed, scant-bearded, leonine Bill Mason!
  A lamp with a white globe shed a bright light. Dale saw a gun on the corner
  of the table, some buckskin sacks, probably containing gold, in front of
  Mason, and some stacks of greenbacks. An open canvas pack sat on the floor
  beside the table. Another pack, half full, and surrounded by articles of
  clothing added to Dale's conviction that the horse-thief leader was preparing
  to leave this rendezvous. The dark frown on Mason's brow appeared to cast its
  shadow over his strong visage.</p>

  <p>A woman's voice, high-pitched and sweet, coming through the open door of
  the cabin, rang stingingly on Dale's ears.</p>

  <p>"...I told you...keep your horsy hands off me. I can walk."</p>

  <p>Mason started up in surprise. "A woman! Now, what in hell?"</p>

  <p>Then Edith Watrous, pale and worn, her hair disheveled and her dress so
  ripped that she had to hold it together, entered the cabin to fix dark and
  angry eyes upon the dual-sided rancher. Behind her, cool and sardonic, master
  of the situation, appeared Reed, blocking the door as if to keep anyone else
  out.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mason, I am Edith...Watrous," panted the girl.</p>

  <p>"You needn't tell me that. I know you...What in the world are you doing
  here?" rejoined Mason slowly, as he arose to his commanding height. He
  exhibited dismay, but he was courteous.</p>

  <p>"I've been...treated to an...outrage. I was in Halsey...visiting friends.
  There was a horse sale...I went out. I found my horse Dick&mdash;and saw
  other Watrous horses in the bunch...I promptly told this man Reed it was my
  horse. He argued with me...Then Hildrith came up...and that precipitated
  trouble. Reed put something up to Hildrith&mdash;I didn't get just what. But
  it looks bad. I thought he was going to kill Hildrith. But he didn't. He
  cursed Hildrith and said he'd see what the boss would do about it...They
  threw me on Reed's horse...made me straddle his saddle in front...and I had
  to endure a long ride...with my dress up to my head...my legs exposed to
  brush...and, what was more, to...to the eyes of Reed and his louts...It was
  terrible...I'm so perfectly furious that...that..."</p>

  <p>She choked in her impassioned utterance.</p>

  <p>"Miss Watrous, I don't blame you," said Mason. "Please understand this is
  not my doing." Then he fastened his black angry eyes upon his subordinate.
  "Fool! What's your game?"</p>

  <p>"Boss, I didn't have any," returned Reed coolly. "I just saw red. It
  popped into my head to make off with this stuck-up Watrous woman. And here we
  are."</p>

  <p>"Reed, you're lying. You've got some deep game...Jim Watrous was a friend
  of mine. I can't stand for such an outrage to his daughter."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to stand it, Mason. You and I split, you know, over this last
  deal. It's just as I gambled would happen. You've ruined us. We're
  through."</p>

  <p>"Ha! I can tell you as much."</p>

  <p>"There was a wild-horse hunter down at Halsey&mdash;Dale Brittenham. I
  know about him. He's the man who trailed Ben, Alec and Steve&mdash;killed
  them. He's onto us. I saw that. He'll have a hundred gunners on our trail by
  sunup."</p>

  <p>"Ed, that's not half we're up against," replied the chief gloomily. "This
  homesteader Rogers, with his trail to Bannock&mdash;that settled our hash.
  Stafford and Watrous have a big outfit after us. I heard it at Bannock.
  That's why I sold out. I'm leaving here as soon as I can pack."</p>

  <p>"Fine. That's like you. Engineered all the jobs and let us do the stealing
  while you hobnobbed with the ranchers you robbed. Now you'll leave us to
  fight...Mason, I'm getting out too&mdash;and I'm taking the girl."</p>

  <p>"Good God! Ed, it's bad enough to be a horse thief like this...Why, man,
  it's madness! What for, I ask you?"</p>

  <p>"That's my business."</p>

  <p>"You want to make Watrous pay to get her back. He'd do it, of course. But
  he'd tear Montana to pieces, and hang you."</p>

  <p>"I might take his money&mdash;later. But I confess to a weakness for the
  young lady...And I'll get even with Hildrith."</p>

  <p>"Revenge, eh? You always hated Leale. But what's he got to do with your
  game?"</p>

  <p>"He's crazy in love with her. Engaged to marry her."</p>

  <p>"He <i>was</i> engaged to me, Mr. Mason," interposed Edith scornfully. "I
  thought I cared for him. But I really didn't. I despise him now. I wouldn't
  marry him if he was the last man on earth."</p>

  <p>"Reed, does she know?" asked Mason significantly.</p>

  <p>"Well, she's not dumb, and I reckon she's got a hunch."</p>

  <p>"I'll be...!" Whatever Mason's profanity was, he did not give it
  utterance. "Hildrith! But we had plans to pull stakes and leave this country.
  Did he intend to marry Miss Watrous and bring her with us?...That's not
  conceivable."</p>

  <p>"Boss, he cheated you. He never meant to leave."</p>

  <p>Mason made a passionate gesture, and as if to strike deep and hard, his
  big eyes rolled in a fierce glare. It was plain now to the watching Dale why
  Reed had wanted Hildrith to face his chief.</p>

  <p>"Where's Hildrith?" growled Mason.</p>

  <p>"Out by the fire under guard."</p>

  <p>"Call him in." Reed went out.</p>

  <p>Then Edith turned wonderingly and fearfully to Mason.</p>

  <p>"Hildrith is <i>your</i> man!" she affirmed rather than queried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Watrous, he was."</p>

  <p>"Then <i>he</i> is the spy, the scout&mdash;the traitor who acted as
  go-between for you."</p>

  <p>"Miss Watrous, he certainly has been my right-hand man for eight
  years...And I'm afraid Reed and you are right about his being a traitor."</p>

  <p>At that juncture Hildrith lunged into the cabin as if propelled viciously
  from behind. He was ashen-hued under his beard. Reed stamped in after him,
  forceful and malignant, sure of the issue. But just as Mason, after a steady
  hard look at his lieutenant, was about to address him, Edith flung herself in
  front of Hildrith.</p>

  <p>"It's all told, Leale Hildrith," she cried with a fury of passion. "Reed
  gave you away. Mason corroborated him...<i>You</i> are the tool of these men.
  <i>You</i> were the snake in the grass. <i>You,</i> the liar who ingratiated
  himself into my father's confidence. Made love to me! Nagged me until I was
  beside myself!...But your wrong to me&mdash;your betrayal of Dad&mdash;these
  fall before your treachery to Dale Brittenham...You let <i>him</i> take on
  your guilt...Oh, I see it all now. It's ghastly. That man loved you...You
  despicable...despicable..."</p>

  <p>Edith broke off, unable to find further words. With tears running down her
  colorless cheeks, her eyes magnificent with piercing fire, she manifestly
  enthralled Reed with her beauty and passion. She profundly impressed Mason
  and she struck deep into what manhood the stricken Hildrith had left.</p>

  <p>"All true, Bill, I'm sorry to confess," he said, his voice steady. "I'm
  offering no excuse. But look at her, man...look at her! And then you'll
  understand."</p>

  <p>"What's that, Miss, about Dale Brittenham?" queried Mason.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham is a wild-horse hunter," answered Edith, catching her breath.
  "Hildrith befriended him once. Dale loved Hildrith...When Stafford came to
  see Dad&mdash;after the last raid&mdash;he accused Dale of being the spy who
  kept your gang posted. The go-between. He had the sheriff come to arrest
  Dale...Oh, I see it all now. Dale <i>knew</i> Hildrith was the traitor. He
  sacrificed himself for Hildrith&mdash;to pay his debt...or because he thought
  I loved the man. For us both!...He drew a gun on Bayne&mdash;said Stafford
  was right&mdash;that <i>he</i> was the horse-thief spy...Then he rode
  away."</p>

  <p>It was a poignant moment. No man could have been unaffected by the girl's
  tragic story. Mason paced to and fro, then halted behind the table.</p>

  <p>"Boss, that's not all," interposed Reed triumphantly. "Down at Halsey,
  Hildrith showed his color&mdash;and what meant most to him. Brittenham was
  there, as I've told you. And <i>he</i> was onto us. I saw the jig was up. I
  told Hildrith. I put it up to him. To declare himself. Every man there had
  waked up to the fact that we were horse thieves. I asked Hildrith to make his
  stand&mdash;for or against us. He failed us, boss."</p>

  <p>"Reed, that was a queer thing for you to insist on," declared Mason in
  stem doubt. "Hildrith's cue was the same as mine. Respectability. Could you
  expect him to betray himself there&mdash;before all, Halsey and his
  sweetheart, too?"</p>

  <p>"I knew he wouldn't. But I meant it."</p>

  <p>"You wanted to show him up, before them all, especially her?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly did."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're low-down yourself, Reed, when it comes to one you hate."</p>

  <p>"All's fair in love and war," replied the other with a flippant laugh.</p>

  <p>The chief turned to Hildrith. "I'm not concerned with the bad blood
  between you and Reed. But...is he lying?"</p>

  <p>"No. But down at Halsey I didn't understand he meant me to give myself
  away," replied Hildrith with the calmness of bitter resignation. He had
  played a great game, for a great stake, and he had lost. Friendship, loyalty,
  treachery, were nothing compared to his love for this girl.</p>

  <p>"Would you have done so if you had understood Reed?"</p>

  <p>"No. Why should I? There was no disloyalty in that. If I'd guessed that,
  I'd have shot him."</p>

  <p>"You didn't think quick and right. That'd have been your game. Too late,
  Hildrith. I've a hunch it's too late for all of us...You meant to marry Miss
  Watrous if she'd have you?"</p>

  <p>"Why ask that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was unnecessary...And you really let this Brittenham sacrifice
  himself for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'd have sacrificed anyone&mdash;my own brother."</p>

  <p>"I see. That was dirty, Leale...But after all these things, don't...You've
  been a faithful pard for many years. God knows, a woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Boss, he betrayed <i>you</i>," interrupted Reed stridently. "All the rest
  doesn't count. He split with you. He absolutely was not going to leave the
  country with you."</p>

  <p>"I get that&mdash;hard as it is to believe," rasped Mason, and he took up
  the big gun from the table and deliberately cocked it.</p>

  <p>Edith cried out low and falteringly, "Oh...don't kill him! If it was for
  me, spare him!"</p>

  <p>Reed let out that sardonic laugh. "Bah! He'll deny...he'll lie with his
  last breath."</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't save you, Leale, but..." Mason halted, the dark embodiment
  of honor among thieves.</p>

  <p>"Hell! I deny nothing," rang out Hildrith, with something grand in his
  defiance. "It's all true. I broke over the girl. I was through with you,
  Mason&mdash;you and your raids, you and your lousy sneak here, you and your
  low-down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The leveled gun boomed to cut short Hildrith's wild denunciation. Shot
  through the heart, he swayed a second, his distorted visage fixing, and then,
  with a single explosion of gasping breath, he fell backward through the
  door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">A HEAVY cloud of smoke obscured Dale's sight of the center
  of the cabin. As he leaned there near the window, strung like a quivering
  wire, he heard the thump of Mason's gun on the table. It made the gold coins
  jingle in their sacks. The thud of boots and hoarse shouts arose on the far
  side of the cabin. Then the smoke drifted away to expose Mason hunched back
  against the table, peering through the door into the blackness. Reed knelt on
  the floor where Edith had sunk in a faint.</p>

  <p>Other members of the gang arrived outside the cabin. "Hyar! It's Hildrith.
  Reckon the boss croaked him."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe Reed did it. He sure was hankerin' to."</p>

  <p>"How air you, chief?" called a third man, presenting a swarthy face in the
  lamplight.</p>

  <p>"I'm...all right," replied Mason huskily. "Hildrith betrayed us. I bored
  him...Drag him away...You can divide what you find on him."</p>

  <p>"Hey, I'm in on that," called Reed as the swarthy man backed away from the
  door. "Lay hold, fellers."</p>

  <p>Slow, labored footfalls died away. Mason opened his gun to eject the
  discharged shell and to replace it with one from his belt.</p>

  <p>"She keeled over," said Reed as he lifted the girl's head.</p>

  <p>"So I see...Sudden and raw for a tenderfoot. I'm damn glad she hated
  him...Did you see him feeling for his gun?"</p>

  <p>"No. It's just as well I took that away from him on the way up. Nothing
  yellow about Hildrith at the finish."</p>

  <p>"Queer what a woman can do to a man! Reed, haven't you lost your head over
  this one?"</p>

  <p>"Hell yes!" exploded the other.</p>

  <p>"Better turn her loose. She'll handicap you. This hole will be swarming
  with posses tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"You're sloping tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I am...How many horses did you sell?"</p>

  <p>"Eighty-odd. None under a hundred dollars. And we drove back the
  best."</p>

  <p>"Keep it. Pay your outfit. We're square. My advice is to let this Watrous
  girl go, and make tracks away from here."</p>

  <p>"Thanks...But I won't leave my tracks," returned Reed constrainedly.
  "She's coming too."</p>

  <p>"Pack her out of here...Reed, I wouldn't be in your boots for a
  million."</p>

  <p>"And just why, boss?"</p>

  <p>"Women always were your weakness. Your only one. You'll hang on to the
  Watrous girl."</p>

  <p>"You bet your life I will."</p>

  <p>"Don't bet my life on it. You're gambling your own. And you'! lose
  it."</p>

  <p>Reed picked up the reviving Edith and took her through the door, turning
  sidewise to keep from striking her head. Dale's last glimpse of his gloating
  expression, as he gazed down into her face, nerved him to instant and
  reckless action. Reed had turned to the left outside the door, which gave
  Dale the impression that he did not intend to carry the girl toward the
  campfires.</p>

  <p>Nalook touched Dale and silently indicated that he would go around his end
  of the cabin. Dale turned to the left. At the corner he waited to peer out.
  He saw a dark form cross the campfire light. Reed! He was turning away from
  his comrades, now engaged in a heated hubbub, no doubt over money and
  valuables they had found on Hildrith.</p>

  <p>Dale had to fight his overwhelming eagerness. He stole out to follow Reed.
  The man made directly for the shack that Dale and Nalook had passed on their
  stalk to the cabin. Dale did not stop to see if the Indian followed, though
  he expected him to do so. Dale held himself to an absolutely noiseless
  stealth. The deep grass made that possible.</p>

  <p>Edith let out a faint cry, scarcely audible. It seemed to loose springs of
  fire in Dale's muscles. He glided on, gaining upon the outlaw with his
  burden. They drew away from the vicinity of the campfires. Soon Dale grew
  sufficiently accustomed to the starlight to keep track of Reed. The girl was
  speaking incoherently. Dale would rather have had her still unconscious. She
  might scream and draw Reed's comrades in that direction.</p>

  <p>Under the trees, between the bunches of scrub oak, Reed hurried. His
  panting breath grew quite audible. Edith was no slight burden, especially as
  she had begun to struggle in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Where?...Who?...Let me down," she cried, but weakly.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, or I'll bat you one," he panted.</p>

  <p>The low shack loomed up blacker than the shadows. A horse, tethered in the
  gloom, snorted at Reed's approach. Dale, now only a few paces behind the
  outlaw, gathered all his forces for a spring.</p>

  <p>"Let me go...Let me go...I'll scream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, I tell you. If you scream I'll choke you. If you fight, I'll
  beat you."</p>

  <p>"But, Reed...for God's sake!...You're not drunk. You must be mad&mdash;if
  you mean..."</p>

  <p>"Girl, I didn't know what I meant when I grabbed you down there," he
  panted passionately, "but I know now...I'm taking you away...Edith
  Watrous...out of Montana...But tonight, by heaven!"</p>

  <p>Dale closed in swiftly and silently. With relentless strength he crushed a
  strangling hold around Reed's neck. The man snorted as his head went back.
  The girl dropped with a sudden gasp. Then Dale, the fingers of his left hand
  buried in Reed's throat, released his right hand to grasp his gun. He did not
  dare to shoot, but he swung the weapon to try to stun Reed. He succeeded in
  landing only a glancing blow.</p>

  <p>"Aggh!" gasped Reed, and for an instant his body appeared to sink.</p>

  <p>Dale tried to strike again. Because of Reed's sudden grip on his arm he
  could not exert enough power. The gun stuck. Dale felt it catch in the man's
  coat. Reed let out a strangled yell, which Dale succeeded in choking off
  again.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the outlaw let go Dale's right hand and reached for his gun. He
  got to it, but could not draw, due to Dale's constricting arm. Dale pressed
  with all his might. They staggered, swayed, bound together as with bands of
  steel. Dale saw that if his hold loosened on either Reed's throat or gun
  hand, the issue would be terribly perilous. Reed was the larger and more
  powerful, though now at a disadvantage. Dale hung on like the grim death he
  meant to mete out to that man.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, with a tremendous surge, Reed broke Dale's hold and bent him
  back. Then Dale saw he would be forced to shoot. But even as he struggled
  with the gun, Reed, quick as a cat, intercepted it, and with irresistible
  strength turned the weapon away while he drew his own. Dale was swift to
  grasp that with his left hand. A terrific struggle ensued, during which the
  grim and silent combatants both lost hold of their guns.</p>

  <p>Reed succeeded in drawing a knife, which he swung aloft. Dale caught his
  wrist and jerked down on it with such tremendous force that he caused the
  outlaw to stab himself in the side. Then Dale grappled him round the waist,
  pinning both arms to Reed's sides, so that he was unable to withdraw the
  knife. Not only that, but soon Dale's inexorable pressure sank the blade in
  to the hilt. A horrible panting sound escaped Reed's lips.</p>

  <p>Any moment Nalook might come to end this desperate struggle. The knife
  stuck in Reed's side, clear to the hilt. Dale had the thought that he must
  hold on until Reed collapsed. Then he would have to run with Edith and try to
  get up the trail. He could not hope to find the horses in that gloomy
  shadow.</p>

  <p>Reed grew stronger in his frenzy. He whirled so irresistibly that he
  partly broke Dale's hold. They plunged down, with Dale on the top and Reed
  under him. Dale had his wind almost shut off. Another moment...But Reed
  rolled like a bear. Dale, now underneath, wound his left arm around Reed.
  Over and over they rolled, against the cabin, back against a tree, and then
  over a bank. The shock broke both Dale's holds. Reed essayed to yell, but
  only a hoarse sound came forth. Suddenly he had weakened. Dale beat at him
  with his right fist. Then he reached for the knife in Reed's side, found the
  haft, and wrenched so terrifically that he cracked Reed's ribs. The man
  suddenly relaxed. Dale tore the knife out and buried it in Reed's breast.</p>

  <p>That ended the fight. Reed sank shudderingly into a limp state. Dale
  slowly got up, drawing the knife with him. He had sustained no injury that he
  could ascertain at the moment. He was wet with sweat or blood, probably both.
  He slipped the knife in his belt and untied his scarf to wipe his hands and
  face. Then <i>he</i> climbed up the bank, expecting to see Edith's white
  blouse in the darkness.</p>

  <p>But he did not see it. Nor was Nalook there. He called low. No answer! He
  began to search around on the ground. He found his gun. Then he went into the
  shack. Edith was gone and Nalook had not come. Possibly he might have come
  while the fight was going on down over the bank and, seeing the chance to
  save Edith, had made off with her to the horses.</p>

  <p>Dale listened. The crickets were in loud voice. He could see the
  campfires, and heard nothing except the thud of the hoofs. They seemed fairly
  close. He retraced his steps back to the shack. Reed's horse was gone. Dale
  strove for control over his whirling thoughts. He feared that Edith, in her
  terror, had run off at random, to be captured again by some of the outlaws.
  After a moment's consideration, he dismissed that as untenable. She had fled,
  unquestionably, but without a cry, which augured well. Dale searched the
  black rim for the notch that marked the trail. Then he set off.</p>

  <p>Reaching the belt of brush under the rim, he followed it until he came to
  an opening he thought he recognized. A stamp of hoofs electrified him. He
  hurried toward it and presently emerged into a glade less gloomy. First his
  keen sight distinguished Edith's white blouse. She was either sitting or
  lying on the ground. Then he saw the horses. As he hurried forward, Nalook
  met him.</p>

  <p>"Nalook! Is she all right?" he whispered eagerly. "All same okay. No
  hurt."</p>

  <p>"What'd you do?"</p>

  <p>"Me foller. See girl run. Me ketch."</p>

  <p>"Go back to that shack and search Reed. He must have a lot of money on
  him...We rolled over a bank."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" The Indian glided away.</p>

  <p>Dale went on to find Edith sitting propped against a stone. He could not
  distinguish her features, but her posture was eloquent of spent force.</p>

  <p>"Edith," he called gently.</p>

  <p>"Oh...Dale!...Are you...?"</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," he replied hastily.</p>

  <p>"You...you killed him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I had to. Are you hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Only bruised. That ride!...Then he handled me...Oh, the brute! I'm glad
  you killed...I saw you bend him back&mdash;hit him. I knew you would. But it
  was awful...And seeing Leale murdered, so suddenly&mdash;right before my
  eyes&mdash;that was worse."</p>

  <p>"Put all that out of your mind...Let me help you up. We can't stay here
  long. Your hands are like ice," he whispered as he got her up.</p>

  <p>"I'm freezing to death," she replied. "This thin waist. I left my coat in
  the buckboard."</p>

  <p>"Here. Slip into mine." Dale helped her into his coat, and then began to
  rub her cold hands between his.</p>

  <p>"Dale, I wasn't afraid of Reed&mdash;at first. I scorned him. I saw how
  his men liked that. I kept telling him that you would kill him for this
  outrage to me. That if <i>you</i> didn't, Dad would hang him. But there in
  Mason's cabin&mdash;there I realized my danger...You must have been
  close."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Nalook and I watched between the logs. I saw it all. But I tell you
  to forget it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, will I ever?...Dale, you saved me from God only knows what," she
  whispered, and putting her arms around his neck, she leaned upon his breast,
  and looked up. Out of her pale face great midnight eyes that reflected the
  starlight transfixed him with their mystery and passion. "You liar. You
  fool!" she went on, her soft voice belying the hard words. "You poor
  misguided man! To dishonor your name for Hildrith's sake! To tell Stafford he
  was right! To let Dad hear you say you were a horse thief!...Oh, I shall
  never forgive you."</p>

  <p>"My dear. I did it for Leale&mdash;and perhaps more for your sake,"
  replied Dale unsteadily. "I thought you loved him. That was a chance to
  reform. He would have done it, too if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care what he would have done. I imagined I loved him. But I
  didn't. I was a vain, silly, headstrong girl. And I was influenced. I don't
  believe I ever could have married him&mdash;after you brought back my horses.
  I didn't realize then. But when I kissed you...Oh, Dale! Something tore
  through my heart. I know now. It was love. Even then, what I needed was this
  horrible experience. It has awakened me...Oh, Dale, if I loved you then, what
  do you think it is now?"</p>

  <p>"I can't think...dearest," whispered Dale huskily, as he drew her closer,
  and bent over her to lay his face against her hair. "Only, if you're not out
  of your mind, I'm the luckiest man that ever breathed."</p>

  <p>"Dale, I'm distraught, yes, and my heart is bursting. But I know I love
  you...love you...love you! Oh, with all my mind and soul!"</p>

  <p>Dale heard in a tumultuous exaltation, and he stood holding her with an
  intensely vivid sense of the place and moment. The ragged rim loomed above
  them, dark and forbidding, as if to warn; the incessant chirp of crickets,
  the murmur of running water, the rustle of the wind in the brush, proved that
  he was alive and awake, living the most poignant moment of his life.</p>

  <p>Then Nalook glided silently into the glade. Dale released Edith, and
  stepped back to meet the Indian. Nalook thrust into his hands a heavy bundle
  tied up in a scarf.</p>

  <p>"Me keep gun," he said, and bent over his saddle. "What'll we do, Nalook?"
  asked Dale.</p>

  <p>"Me stay&mdash;watch trail. You take girl Halsey."</p>

  <p>"Dale, I couldn't ride it. I'm exhausted. I can hardly stand," interposed
  Edith.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I'd get lost in the dark," returned Dale thoughtfully. "I've a
  better plan. There's a homesteader in this valley. Man named Rogers. I knew
  him over in the mountains. An' I ran across his cabin a day or so ago. It's
  not far. I'll take you there. Then tomorrow I'll go with you to Bannock, or
  send you with him."</p>

  <p>"Send me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've got to be here. Strickland agreed to send a posse after me in
  half an hour&mdash;an' later a big outfit of cowboys."</p>

  <p>"But you've rescued me. Need you stay? Nalook can guide these men."</p>

  <p>"I reckon I want to help clean out these horse thieves."</p>

  <p>"Bayne is on your trail with a posse."</p>

  <p>"Probably he's with Stafford's outfit."</p>

  <p>"That won't clear you of Stafford's accusation."</p>

  <p>"No. But Strickland an' his outfit will clear me. I must be here when that
  fight comes off. If it comes. You heard Mason say he was leavin' tonight. I
  reckon they'll all get out pronto."</p>

  <p>"Dale! You...you might get shot&mdash;or even...Oh, these are wicked, hard
  men!" exclaimed Edith as she fastened persuasive hands on his coatless
  arms.</p>

  <p>"That's the chance I must run to clear my name, Edith," he rejoined
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"You took a fearful chance with Reed."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But he had you in his power."</p>

  <p>"My life and more were at stake then," she said earnestly. "It's still my
  love and my happiness."</p>

  <p>"Edith, I'll have Nalook beside me an' we'll fight like Indians. I swear
  I'll come out of it alive."</p>

  <p>"Then...go ahead...anyway..." she whispered almost inaudibly, and let her
  nerveless hands drop from him.</p>

  <p>"Nalook, you watch the trail," ordered Dale. "Stop any man climbing out.
  When Strickland's posse comes, hold them till the cowboys get here. If I hear
  shots this way, I'll come pronto."</p>

  <p>The Indian grunted and, taking up his rifle, stole away. Dale untied and
  led his horse up to where his saddle lay. Soon he had him saddled and
  bridled. Then he put on his spurs, which the Indian had remembered to
  get.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Dale, reaching for Edith. When he lifted her, it came home to
  him why Reed had not found it easy to carry her.</p>

  <p>"That's comfortable, if I can stay on," she said, settling herself.</p>

  <p>"Hoofs, old boy," whispered Dale to his horse. "No actin' up. This'll be
  the most precious load you ever carried."</p>

  <p>Then Dale, rifle in hand, took the bridle and led the horse out into the
  open. The lake gleamed like a black starlit mirror. Turning to the right,
  Dale slowly chose the ground and walked a hundred steps or more before he
  halted to listen. He went on and soon crossed the trail. Beyond that he
  breathed easier, and did not stop again until he had half circled the lake.
  He saw lights across the water up among the trees, but heard no alarming
  sound.</p>

  <p>"How're you ridin'?" he whispered to Edith.</p>

  <p>"I can stick on if it's not too far."</p>

  <p>"Half a mile more."</p>

  <p>As he proceeded, less fearful of being heard, he began to calculate about
  where he should look for Rogers's canyon. He had carefully marked it almost
  halfway between the two lakes and directly across from the highest point of
  the rim. When Dale got abreast of this he headed to the right, and was soon
  under the west wall. Then despite the timber on the rim and the shadowed
  background, he located a gap which he made certain marked the canyon.</p>

  <p>But he could not find any trail leading into it. Therefore he began to
  work a cautious way through the thickets. The gurgle and splash of running
  water guided him. It was so pitch black that he had to feel his way. The
  watercourse turned out to be-rocky, and he abandoned that. When he began to
  fear he was headed wrong, a dark tunnel led him out into the open canyon. He
  went on and turned a corner to catch the gleam of a light. Then he rejoiced
  at his good fortune. In a few minutes more he arrived at the cabin. The door
  was open. Dale heard voices.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Rogers, are you home?" he called.</p>

  <p>An exclamation and thud of bootless feet attested to the homesteader's
  presence. The next instant he appeared in the door.</p>

  <p>"Who's thar?"</p>

  <p>"Brittenham," replied Dale, and lifting Edith off the saddle, he carried
  her up on the porch into the light. Rogers came out in amazement. His wife
  cried from the door, "For land's sake!"</p>

  <p>"Wal, a girl! Aw, don't say she's hurt," burst out the homesteader.</p>

  <p>"You bet it's a girl. An' thank heaven she's sound! Jim Watrous's
  daughter, Rogers. She was kidnapped by Reed at the Halsey horse sale. That
  happened this afternoon. I just got her back. Now, Mrs. Rogers, will you take
  her in for tonight? Hide her someplace."</p>

  <p>"That I will. She can sleep in the loft...Come in, my dear child. You're
  white as a sheet."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I've had enough to make me green," replied Edith, limping into
  the cabin.</p>

  <p>Dale led Rogers out of earshot. "Hell will bust loose here about
  tomorrow," he said, and briefly told about the several posses en route for
  the horse thieves' stronghold, and the events relating to the capture and
  rescue of Edith.</p>

  <p>"By gad! Thet's all good," ejaculated the homesteader. "But it's not so
  good&mdash;all of us hyar if they have a big fight."</p>

  <p>"Maybe the gang will slope. Mason is leavin'. I heard him tell Reed. An'
  Reed meant to take the girl. I don't know about the rest of them."</p>

  <p>"Wal, these fellers ain't likely to rustle in the dark. They've been too
  secure. An' they rigger they can't be surprised at night."</p>

  <p>"If Mason leaves by the lower trail, he'll get shot. My Indian pard is
  watchin' there."</p>

  <p>"Gosh, I hope he tries it."</p>

  <p>"Mason had his table loaded with bags of coin an' stacks of bills. We sure
  ought to get that an' pay back the people he's robbed."</p>

  <p>"It's a good bet Mason won't take the upper trail...Brittenham, you look
  fagged. Better have some grub an' drink. An' sleep a little."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But I'm a bloody mess, an' don't want the women to see me. Fetch me
  somethin' out here."</p>

  <p>Later Dale and Rogers walked down to the valley. They did not see any
  lights or hear any sounds. Both ends of the gorge, where the trails led up,
  were dark and silent. They returned, and Dale lay down on the porch on some
  sheepskins. He did not expect to sleep. His mind was too full. Only the
  imminence of a battle could have kept his mind off the wondrous and
  incomprehensible fact of Edith's avowal. After pondering over the facts and
  probabilities, Dale decided a fight was inevitable. Mason and Reed had both
  impressed him as men at the end of their ropes. The others would, no doubt,
  leave, though not so hurriedly, and most probably would be met on the way
  out.</p>

  <p>Long after Rogers's cabin was dark and its inmates wrapped in slumber,
  Dale lay awake, listening, thinking, revolving plans to get Edith safely away
  and still not seem to shirk his share of the fight. But at least, worn out by
  strenuous activity and undue call on his emotions, Dale fell asleep.</p>

  <p>A step on the porch aroused him. It was broad daylight. Rogers was coming
  in with an armload of firewood.</p>

  <p>"All serene, Brittenham," he said with satisfaction. "Good. I'll wash an'
  slip down to get a look at the valley."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I'd say if these outfits of cowboys was on hand, they'd be down long
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Me too." Dale did not go clear out into the gateway of the valley. He
  climbed to a ruddy eminence and surveyed the gorge from the lookout. Sweeping
  the gray-green valley with eager gaze, he failed to see a moving object. Both
  upper and lower ends of the gorge appeared as vacant as they were silent. But
  at length he quickened sharply to columns of blue smoke rising above the
  timber up from the lower lake. He watched for a good hour. The sun rose over
  the gap at the east rim. Concluding that posses and cowboys had yet to
  arrive, Dale descended the bluff and retraced his steps toward the cabin.</p>

  <p>He considered sending Edith out in charge of Rogers, to conduct her as far
  as Bannock. This idea he at once conveyed to Rogers.</p>

  <p>"Don't think much of it," returned the homesteader forcibly. "Better hide
  her an' my family in a cave. I know where they'll be safe until this fracas
  is over."</p>

  <p>"Well! I reckon that is better."</p>

  <p>"Come in an' eat. Then we'll go scoutin'. An' if we see any riders, we'll
  rustle back to hide the women an' kids."</p>

  <p>Dale had about finished a substantial breakfast when he thought he heard a
  horse neigh somewhere at a distance. He ran out on the porch and was suddenly
  shocked to a standstill. Scarcely ten paces out stood a man with leveled
  rifle.</p>

  <p>"Hands up, Britt," he ordered with a hissing breath. Two other men, just
  behind him, leaped forward to present guns, and one of them yelled, "Hyar he
  is, Bayne."</p>

  <p><i>"Rustle! Up with 'em!"</i></p>

  <p>Then Dale, realizing the cold bitter fact of an unlooked-for situation,
  shot up his arms just as Rogers came stamping out.</p>

  <p>"What the hell? <i>Who</i>..."</p>

  <p>Six or eight more men, guns in hands, appeared at the right, led by the
  red-faced sheriff of Salmon. He appeared to be bursting with importance and
  vicious triumph. Dale surveyed the advancing group, among whom he recognized
  old enemies, and then his gaze flashed back to the first man with the leveled
  rifle. This was none other than Pickens, a crooked young horse trader who had
  all the reason in the world to gloat over rounding up Dale in this way.</p>

  <p>"Guess I didn't have a hunch up thar, fellers, when we crossed this
  trail," declared Bayne in loud voice. "Guess I didn't measure his hoss tracks
  down at Watrous's for nothin'!"</p>

  <p>"Bayne, you got the drop," spoke up Dale coolly, "and I'm not fool enough
  to draw in the face of that."</p>

  <p>"You did draw on me once, though, didn't you, wild-hoss hunter?" called
  Bayne derisively.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"An' you told Stafford he was right, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No buts. You admitted you was a hoss thief, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Rogers here can explain that, if you won't listen to me."</p>

  <p>"Wal, Brittenham, your homesteadin' pard can explain thet after we hang
  you!"</p>

  <p>Rogers stalked off the porch in the very face of the menacing guns and
  confronted Bayne in angry expostulation.</p>

  <p>"See here, Mr. Bayne, you're on the wrong track."</p>

  <p>"We want no advice from you," shouted Bayne. "An' you'd better look out or
  we'll give you the same dose."</p>

  <p>"Boss, he's shore one of this hoss-thief gang," spoke up a lean, weathered
  member of the posse.</p>

  <p>"My name's Rogers. I'm a homesteader. I have a wife an' two children.
  There are men in Bannock who'll vouch for my honesty," protested Rogers.</p>

  <p>"Reckon so. But they ain't here. You stay out of this...Hold him up,
  men."</p>

  <p>Two of them prodded the homesteader with cocked rifles, a reckless and
  brutal act that would have made the bravest man turn gray. Rogers put up
  shaking hands.</p>

  <p>"Friend Rogers, don't interfere," warned Dale, who had grasped the deadly
  nature of Bayne's procedure. The sheriff believed Dale was one of the
  mysterious band of thieves that had been harassing the ranchers of Salmon
  River Valley for a long time. It had galled him, no doubt, to fail to bring a
  single thief to justice. Added to that was an animosity toward Dale and a
  mean leaning to exercise his office. He wanted no trial. He would brook no
  opposition. Dale stood there a self-confessed criminal.</p>

  <p>"Rope Brittenham," ordered Bayne. "Tie his hands behind his back. Bore him
  if he as much as winks."</p>

  <p>Two of the posse dragged Dale off the porch, and in a moment had bound him
  securely. Then Dale realized too late that he should have leaped while he was
  free to snatch a gun from one of his captors, and fought it out. He had not
  taken seriously Bayne's threat to hang him. But he saw now that unless a
  miracle came to pass, he was doomed. The thought was so appalling that it
  clamped him momentarily in an icy terror. Edith was at the back of that
  emotion. He had faced death before without flinching, but to be hanged while
  Edith was there, possibly a witness&mdash;that would be too horrible. Yet he
  read it in the hard visages of Bayne and his men. By a tremendous effort he
  succeeded in getting hold of himself.</p>

  <p>"Bayne, this job is not law," he expostulated. "It's revenge. When my
  innocence is proved, you'll be in a tight fix."</p>

  <p>"Innocence! Hell, man, didn't you confess your guilt?" ejaculated Bayne.
  "Stafford heard you, same as Watrous an' his friends."</p>

  <p>"All the same, that was a lie."</p>

  <p>"Aw, it was? My Gawd, man, but you take chances with your life! An' what'd
  you lie for?"</p>

  <p>"I lied for Edith Watrous."</p>

  <p>Bayne stared incredulously and then he guffawed. He turned to his men.</p>

  <p>"Reckon we better shet off his wind. The man's plumb loco."</p>

  <p>From behind Dale a noose, thrown by a lanky cowboy, sailed and widened to
  encircle his head, and to be drawn tight. The hard knot came just under
  Dale's chin and shut off the hoarse cry that formed involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"Over thet limb, fellers," called out Bayne briskly, pointing to a
  spreading branch of a pion tree some few yards farther out. Dale was dragged
  under it. The loose end of the rope was thrown over the branch, to fall into
  eager hands.</p>

  <p>"Dirty business, Bayne, you&mdash;!" shouted Rogers, shaken by horror and
  wrath. "So help me Gawd, you'll rue it!"</p>

  <p>Bayne leaped malignantly, plainly in the grip of passion too strong for
  reason.</p>

  <p>"Thar's five thousand dollars' reward wrapped up in this wild-hoss
  hunter's hide, an' I ain't takin' any chance of losin' it."</p>

  <p>Dale forced a strangled utterance. "Bayne...I'll double that...if you'll
  arrest me...give...fair trial."</p>

  <p>"Haw! Haw! Wal, listen to our ragged hoss thief talk big money."</p>

  <p>"Boss, he ain't got two bits...We're wastin' time."</p>

  <p>"Swing him, fellers!"</p>

  <p>Four or five men stretched the rope and had lifted Dale to his toes when a
  piercing shriek from the cabin startled them so violently that they let him
  down again. Edith Watrous came flying out, half-dressed, her hair down, her
  face blanched. Her white blouse fluttered in her hand as she ran, barefooted,
  across the grass.</p>

  <p>"Merciful heaven! Dale! That rope!" she screamed, and as the shock of
  realization came, she dropped her blouse to the ground and stood stricken
  before the staring men, her bare round arms and lovely shoulders shining
  white in the sunlight. Her eyes darkened, dilated, enlarged as her
  consciousness grasped the significance here, and then fixed in terror.</p>

  <p>Dale's ghastly sense of death faded. This girl would save him. A dozen
  Baynes could not contend with Edith Watrous, once she was roused.</p>

  <p>"Edith, they were about...to hang me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Hang you</i>?" she cried, suddenly galvanized. "These
  men?...<i>Bayne</i>?"</p>

  <p>Leaping red blood burned out the pallor of her face. It swept away in a
  wave, leaving her whiter than before, and with eyes like coals of living
  fire.</p>

  <p>"Miss Watrous. What you...doin' here?" queried Bayne, halting, confused by
  this apparition.</p>

  <p>"I'm here&mdash;not quite too late," she replied, as if to herself, and a
  ring of certainty in her voice followed hard on the tremulous evidence of her
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Kinda queer&mdash;meetin' you up here in this outlaw den," went on Bayne
  with a nervous cough.</p>

  <p>"Bayne...I remember," she said ponderingly, ignoring his statement. "The
  gossip linking Dale's name with this horse-thief outfit...Stafford!...Your
  intent to arrest Dale!...His drawing on you! His strange acceptance of
  Stafford's accusation!"</p>

  <p>"Nothin' strange about thet, Miss," rejoined Bayne brusquely. "Brittenham
  was caught in a trap. An' like a wolf, he bit back."</p>

  <p>"That confession had to do with me, Mr. Bayne," she retorted.</p>

  <p>"So he said. But I ain't disregardin' same."</p>

  <p>"You are not arresting him," she asserted swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Nope, I ain't."</p>

  <p>"But didn't you let him explain?" she queried.</p>

  <p>"I didn't want no cock-an'-bull explainin' from him or this doubtful pard
  of his here, Rogers...I'll just hang Brittenham an' let Rogers talk
  afterwards. Reckon he'll not have much to say then."</p>

  <p>"So, that's your plan, you miserable thick-headed skunk of a sheriff?" she
  exclaimed in lashing scorn. She swept her flaming eyes from Bayne to his
  posse, all of whom appeared uneasy over this interruption.
  "Pickens!...Hall...Jason...Pike! And some more hard nuts from Salmon. Why, if
  you were honest yourself, you'd arrest them. My father could put Pickens in
  jail...Bayne, your crew of a posse reflects suspiciously on you."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I ain't carin' for what you think. It's plain to me you've took
  powerful with this hoss thief an' I reckon thet reflects suspicions on you,
  Miss," rejoined Bayne, galled to recrimination.</p>

  <p>A scarlet blush wiped out the whiteness of Edith's neck and face. She
  burned with shame and fury. That seemed to remind her of herself, of her
  half-dressed state, and she bent to pick up her blouse. When she rose to slip
  her arms through the garment, she was pale again. She forgot to button
  it.</p>

  <p>"You dare not hang Brittenham."</p>

  <p>"Wal, lady, I just do," he declared, but he was weakening somehow.</p>

  <p>"You shall not!"</p>

  <p>"Better go indoors, Miss. It ain't pleasant to see a man hang an' kick an'
  swell an' grow black in the face."</p>

  <p>Bayne had no conception of the passion and courage of a woman. He
  blundered into the very speeches that made Edith a lioness.</p>

  <p>"Take that rope off his neck," she commanded, as a queen might have to
  slaves.</p>

  <p>The members of the posse shifted from one foot to the other, and betrayed
  that they would have looked to their leader had they been able to remove
  their fascinated gaze from this girl. Pickens, the nearest to her, moved back
  a step, holding his rifle muzzle up. The freckles stood out awkwardly on his
  dirty white face.</p>

  <p>"Give me that rifle," she cried hotly, and she leaped to snatch at it.
  Pickens held on, his visage a study in consternation and alarm. Edith let go
  with one hand and struck him a staggering blow with her fist. Then she fought
  him for the weapon. Bang! It belched fire and smoke up into the tree. She
  jerked it away from him, and leaping back, she worked the lever with a swift
  precision that proved her familiarity with firearms. Without aiming, she shot
  at Pickens's feet. Dale saw the bullet strike up dust between them. Pickens
  leaped with a wild yell and fled.</p>

  <p>Edith whirled upon Bayne. She was magnificent in her rage. Such a thing as
  fear of these men was as far from her as if she had never experienced such an
  emotion. Again she worked the action of the rifle. She held it low at Bayne
  and pulled the trigger. Bang! The bullet sped between his legs, and burned
  the left one, which flinched as the man called, "Hyar! Stop thet, you fool
  woman. You'll kill somebody!"</p>

  <p>"Bayne, I'll kill <i>you</i> if you try to hang Brittenham," she replied,
  her voice ringing high-keyed but level and cold. "Take that noose off his
  neck!"</p>

  <p>The frightened sheriff made haste to comply.</p>

  <p>"Now untie him!"</p>

  <p>"Help me hyar&mdash;somebody," snarled Bayne, turning Dale around to tear
  at the rope. "My Gawd, what's this range comin' to when wild women bust
  loose?...The luck! We can't shoot her! We can't rope Jim Watrous's girl!"</p>

  <p>"Boss, I reckon it may be jist as well," replied the lean gray man who was
  helping him, "'cause it wasn't regular."</p>

  <p>"You men! Put away your guns," ordered Edith. "I wouldn't hesitate to
  shoot any one of you...Now, listen, all of you...Brittenham is no horse
  thief. He is a man who sacrificed his name...his honor, for his
  friend&mdash;and because he thought I loved that friend. Leale Hildrith!
  <i>He</i> was the treacherous spy&mdash;the go-between, the liar who deceived
  my father and me. Dale took his guilt. I never believed it. I followed Dale
  to Halsey. Hildrith followed me. There we found Ed Reed and his outfit
  selling Watrous horses. I recognized my own horse, Dick, and I accused Reed.
  He betrayed Hildrith right there and kidnapped us both, and rode to his
  hole...We got here last night. Reed took me before Bill Mason. Big Bill, who
  is leader of this band. They sent for Hildrith. And Mason shot him. Reed made
  off with me, intending to leave. But Dale had trailed us, and he killed Reed.
  Then he fetched me here to this cabin...You have my word. I swear this is the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I'll be...!" ejaculated Bayne, who had grown so obsessed by Edith's
  story that he had forgotten to untie Dale.</p>

  <p>"Boss! Hosses comin' hell bent!" shouted one of Bayne's men, running
  in.</p>

  <p>"Whar?"</p>

  <p>A ringing trample of swift hoofs on the hard trail drowned further shouts.
  Dale saw a line of riders sweep round the corner and race right down upon the
  cabin. They began to shoot into Bayne's posse. There were six riders, all
  shooting as hard as they were riding, and some of them had two guns leveled.
  Hoarse yells rose about the banging volley of shots.</p>

  <p>The horsemen sped on past, still shooting. Bullets thudded into the cabin.
  The riders vanished in a cloud of dust and the clatter of hoofs died
  away.</p>

  <p>Dale frantically unwound the rope which Bayne had suddenly let go at the
  onslaught of the riders. Freeing himself, Dale leaped to Edith, who had
  dropped the rifle and stood unsteadily, her eyes wild.</p>

  <p>"Did they hit you?" gasped Dale, seizing her.</p>

  <p>Rogers rushed up to join them, holding a hand to a bloody shoulder. "Some
  of Mason's outfit," he boomed, and he gazed around with rolling eyes. Pickens
  lay dead, his bloody head against the tree. Bayne had been shot through the
  middle. A spreading splotch of red on his shirt under his clutching hands
  attested to a mortal wound. Three other men lay either groaning or cursing.
  That left four apparently unscratched, only one of whom, a lean oldish man,
  showed any inclination to help his comrades.</p>

  <p>"Lemme see how bad you're hit," he was growling over one of them.</p>

  <p>"Aw, it ain't bad, but it hurts like hell."</p>

  <p>"Edith, come, I'll take you in," said Dale, putting his arm around the
  weakening girl.</p>

  <p>"Britt, I've a better idee," put in Rogers. "I'll take her an' my family
  to the cave, where they'll be safe."</p>

  <p>"Good! That outfit must have been chased."</p>

  <p>"We'd have heard shots. I reckon they were rustlin' away and jest piled
  into us."</p>

  <p>The two reached the cabin, where Dale said, "Brace up, Edith. It sure was
  tough. It'll be all right now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sick," she whispered, as she leaned against him.</p>

  <p>Rogers went in, calling to his wife. Dale heard him rummaging around. Soon
  he appeared in the door and handed a tin box and a bundle of linen to
  Dale.</p>

  <p>"Those hombres out there can take care of their own wounded."</p>

  <p>Dale pressed Edith's limp hand and begged earnestly, "Don't weaken now,
  dear. Good Lord, how wonderful an' terrible you were!...Edith, I'll bear a
  charmed life after this...Go with Rogers. An' don't worry, dar-lin'...The
  Mason gang is on the run, that's sure."</p>

  <p>"I'll be all right," she replied with a pale smile. "Go&mdash;do what's
  best...but don't stay long away from me."</p>

  <p>Hurrying out, Dale found all save one of the wounded on their feet.</p>

  <p>"Wal, thet's decent of you," said the lean, hawk-faced man, as he received
  the bandages and medicine from Dale. "Bayne jist croaked an' he can stay
  croaked right there for all I care. I'm sorry he made the mistake takin' you
  for a hoss thief."</p>

  <p>"He paid for it," rejoined Dale grimly. "You must bury him and Pickens.
  I'll fetch you some tools. But move them away from here."</p>

  <p>Dale searched around until he found a spade and mattock, which he brought
  back. Meanwhile the spokesman of Bayne's posse and Jason Pike had about
  concluded a hasty binding of the injured men.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, we come down this trail from Bannock. Are there any other
  ways to get in an' out of this hole?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," replied Dale, and squatted down to draw an oval in the dust.
  "This represents the valley. It runs almost directly north an' south. There's
  a trail at each end. This trail of Rogers's leads out of here, almost due
  west, an' leads to Bannock. There might be, an' very probably is, another
  trail on the east side, perhaps back of Mason's camp. But Nalook didn't tell
  me there was."</p>

  <p>"Thet outfit who rid by here to smoke us up&mdash;they must have been
  chased or at least scared."</p>

  <p>"Chased, I figure that, though no cowboys appear to be comin' along. You
  know Stafford an' Watrous were sendin' a big outfit of cowboys up from
  Salmon. They'll come down the south trail. An' I'm responsible for two more,
  raised by a rancher named Strickland over at Halsey. They are due an' they'll
  come in at the lower end of the hole. The north end."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I'd like to be in on that round-up. What say, Jason?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, yes. But, Tom, you'd better send Jerry an' hike out with our
  cripples. They'd just handicap us."</p>

  <p>"Reckon so. Now let's rustle to put these stiffs under the sod an' the
  dew. Strip them of valuables. Funny about Bayne. He was sure rann' to spend
  that five thousand Stafford offered for Brittenham alive or dead."</p>

  <p>"Bayne had some faults. He was some previous on this job...Hyar, fellars,
  give us a hand."</p>

  <p>"I'll rustle my horse," said Dale, and strode off. He had left Hoofs to
  graze at will, but the sturdy bay was nowhere in sight. Finally Dale found
  him in Rogers's corral with two other horses. He led Hoofs back to the cabin,
  and was saddling him when he saw Rogers crossing the brook into the open.
  Evidently he had taken the women and children somewhere in that direction.
  Dale's keen eye approved of the dense thicket of brush and trees leading up
  to a great wall of cliffs and caverns and splintered sections. They would be
  safely hidden in there.</p>

  <p>Then Dale bethought himself of his gun, which Pickens had taken from him.
  He found it under the tree with the weapons, belts and spurs of the slain
  men. Dale took up the carbine that Pickens had held, and which Edith had
  wrenched out of his hands. He decided he would like to keep it, and carried
  it to the cabin.</p>

  <p>Tom and Pike, with the third man, returned from their gruesome task
  somewhere below. The next move was to send the four cripples, one of whom
  lurched in his saddle, up the trail to Bannock with their escort.</p>

  <p>When Dale turned from a dubious gaze after them, he sighted Nalook riding
  up from the valley. The Indian appeared to be approaching warily. Dale
  hallooed and strode out to meet him.</p>

  <p>The Indian pointed with dark hand at the hoof tracks in the trail.</p>

  <p>"Me come slow&mdash;look see."</p>

  <p>"Nalook, those tracks were made by six of Mason's outfit who rode through,
  hell bent for election."</p>

  <p>"Me hear shots."</p>

  <p>"They killed Bayne an' one of his posse, an' crippled four more."</p>

  <p>"Ugh! Bayne jail Injun no more!" Nalook ejaculated with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I should smile not. But, Nalook, what's doin' down in the hole?"</p>

  <p>"Ten paleface, three my people come sunup. No cowboy."</p>

  <p>"Well! That's odd. Strickland guaranteed a big outfit. I wonder...No sign
  of Stafford's cowboys on the other trail?"</p>

  <p>"Me look long, no come."</p>

  <p>"Where's that outfit from Halsey?"</p>

  <p>The Indian indicated by gesture that he had detained these men at the
  rim.</p>

  <p>"You watch trail all night?"</p>

  <p>Nalook nodded, and his inscrutable eyes directed Dale's to the back of his
  saddle. A dark coat of heavy material, and evidently covering a bundle, had
  been bound behind the cantle. Dale put a curious hand on the coat. He felt
  something hard inside, and that caused him to note how securely and rightly
  the coat had been tied on. Suddenly a dark red spot gave him a shock. Blood!
  He touched it, to find it a smear glazed over and dry. Dale looked into the
  bronzed visage and somber eyes of the Indian with a cold sense of
  certainty.</p>

  <p>"Mason?"</p>

  <p>The Indian nodded. "Me watch long. Big Bill he come. Two paleface foller.
  Top trail. Me watch. Big powwow. They want gold. Mason no give. Cuss like
  hell. They shoot. Me kill um."</p>

  <p>"Nalook, you just beat hell!" ejaculated Dale, at once thrilled and
  overcome at the singular way things were working out. He had not forgotten
  the sacks of gold and pile of greenbacks on Mason's table. To let the robber
  chief make off with that had been no easy surrender.</p>

  <p>"Me beat hoss thief," replied the Indian, taking Dale literally. "Big Bill
  no good. He take Palouse girl away."</p>

  <p>"Aha! So that's why you've been so soft and gentle with these horse
  thieves...Nalook, I don't want anyone, not even Rogers, to see this coat an'
  what's in it."</p>

  <p>"Me savvy. Where hide?"</p>

  <p>"Go to the barn. Hide it in the loft under the hay."</p>

  <p>Nalook rode on by the cabin. Dale sat down on the porch to wait for his
  return and the others. He found himself trembling with the significance of
  the moment. He had possession of a large amount of money, probably more than
  enough to reimburse all the ranchers from whom cattle and horses had been
  stolen. Moreover, the losses of any poor ranchers over on the Palouse range
  would have to be made good. That, however, could hardly make much of a hole
  in the fortune Mason had no doubt been accumulating for years.</p>

  <p>The Indian came back from the barn, leading his horse. He sat down beside
  Dale and laid a heavy hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"No look!...Me see man watchin' on the rock," he said.</p>

  <p>"Where'?" asked Dale, checking a start.</p>

  <p>Nalook let go of Dale and curved a thumb that indicated the bare point on
  the west rim, in fact the only lookout on that side, and the one from which
  he had planned to get Rogers's signal. On the moment, Rogers returned.</p>

  <p>"Rogers, stand pat now," said Dale. "The Indian sighted someone watchin'
  us. From the bare point you know, where I was to come for our signal."</p>

  <p>"Wal, thet ain't so good," growled the homesteader with concern. "Must be
  them cusses who busted through here, shootin'. By thunder, I'd like to get a
  crack at the feller who gave me this cut in the shoulder."</p>

  <p>"I forgot, Rogers. Is it serious?"</p>

  <p>"Not atall. But it's sore an' makes me sore. I was fool enough to show it
  to my wife. But I couldn't tie it up myself. Blood always sickens
  wimmen."</p>

  <p>"What do?" asked the Indian.</p>

  <p>"We won't let on we know we're bein' watched...Rogers, could any scout on
  that point see where you took your wife an' Edith?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon not. Fact is, I'm sure not."</p>

  <p>"Well, you stay here. It's reasonable to figure these horse thieves won't
  come back. An' if any others came out of the valley, they'll be stretchin'
  leather. You keep hid. I'll take Nalook an' these men, an' see what's up out
  there."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't do no better. But you want to come back by dark, 'cause that
  girl begged me to tell you," replied Rogers earnestly. "Gosh, I never saw
  such eyes in a human's face. You be...careful, Britt. Thet girl is jist
  livin' for you."</p>

  <p>"Rogers, I'm liable to be so careful that I'll be yellow," rejoined Dale
  soberly.</p>

  <p>Soon Dale was jogging down the trail at the head of the quartet. In the
  brush cover at the outlet of the canyon they had to ride single file. Once
  out in the valley, Nalook was the first to call attention to horses scattered
  here and there all over the green. They evidently had broken out of the
  pasture or had been freed. Dale viewed them and calculated their number with
  satisfaction. Not a rider in sight!</p>

  <p>Dale led a brisk trot. It did not take long to reach the lower trail. Here
  he sent Nalook up to fetch down the ten white men and four Indians that
  Strickland had been able to get together. After an interval of keen survey of
  the valley, Dale voiced his surprise to Tom and Jason.</p>

  <p>"Queer, all right," agreed the older man. "Kinda feels like a lull before
  the storm."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what happened to Stafford's outfit. They've had hours more time
  than needed. They've missed the trail."</p>

  <p>The Indian was clever. He sent the men down on foot, some distance apart.
  They made but little noise and raised scarcely any dust. Dale looked this
  posse over keenly. They appeared to be mostly miners, rough, bearded, matured
  men. There were, however, several cowboys, one of whom Dale had seen at the
  horse sale. The last two to descend the trail proved to be Strickland with
  the Indian.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, you, Strickland!" ejaculated Dale in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't keep out of it, Brittenham," returned the rancher dryly. "This
  sort of thing is my meat. Besides, I'm pretty curious and sore."</p>

  <p>"How about your cowboys?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I can't understand why those outfits haven't shown up, but I
  didn't send for my own. I've only a few now, and they're out on the range.
  Sanborn and Drew were to send theirs, with an outfit from the Circle Bar.
  Damn strange! This is stern range business that concerns the whole
  range."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not so strange. If they were friends of Mason."</p>

  <p>"Thick as hops!" exclaimed Strickland with a snort.</p>

  <p>"We'll go slow an' wait for Stafford's cowboys," decided Dale
  ponderingly.</p>

  <p>"Hoss thieves all get away mebbe," interposed Nalook, plainly not liking
  this idea of waiting.</p>

  <p>"All right, Nalook. What's your advice?"</p>

  <p>"Crawl like Injun," he replied, and spread wide his fingers. "Mebbe soon
  shoot heap much."</p>

  <p>"Strickland, this Indian is simply great. We'll be wise to listen to him.
  Take your men an' follow him. Cowboy, you hide here at the foot of the trail
  an' give the alarm if any riders come down. We've reason to believe some of
  the gang are scoutin' along this west rim. I'll slip up on top an' have a
  look at Mason's camp."</p>

  <p>Drawing his rifle from its saddle sheath, Dale removed his coat and spurs.
  Nalook was already leading his horse into the brush, and the Indians followed
  him. Strickland, with a caustic word of warning to Dale, waved his men after
  the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Come with me. Throw your chaps an' spurs, cowboy," advised Dale, and
  addressed himself to the steep trail. Soon the long-legged cowboy caught up
  with him, but did not speak until they reached the rim. Dale observed that he
  also carried a rifle and had the look of a man who could use it.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, if I see any sneakin' along the rim, shall I smoke 'em up?"
  he queried.</p>

  <p>"You bet, unless they're cowboys."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I shore know thet breed."</p>

  <p>They parted. Dale stole into the evergreens, walking on his toes. He wound
  in and out, keeping as close to the rim as possible, and did not halt until
  he had covered several hundred yards. Then he listened and tried to peer over
  the rim. But he heard nothing and could see only the far part of the valley.
  Another quarter of a mile ought to put him where he could view Mason's camp.
  But he had not gone quite so far when a thud of hoofs on soft ground brought
  him up tight-skinned and cold. A horse was approaching at some little
  distance from the rim. Dale glided out to meet it. Presently he saw a big
  sombrero, then a red youthful face, above some evergreens. In another moment
  horse and rider came into view. Leveling his rifle, Dale called him to halt.
  The rider was unmistakably a young cowboy, and as cool as he could be. He
  complied with some range profanity. Then at second glance he drawled, "Howdy,
  Brittenham."</p>

  <p>"You've got the advantage of me, Mr. Cowboy," retorted Dale curtly.</p>

  <p>"Damn if I can see thet," he rejoined, with a smile that eased Dale's
  grimness.</p>

  <p>"You know me?" querried Dale.</p>

  <p>"Shore, I recognized you. I've a pard, Jen Pierce, who's helped you chase
  wild hosses. My name's Al Cook. We both ride for Stafford."</p>

  <p>"You belong to Stafford's outfit?" asked Dale, lowering his rifle.</p>

  <p>"Yep. We got heah before sunup this mornin'."</p>

  <p>"How many of you an' where are they?"</p>

  <p>"About twenty, I figger. Didn't count. Jud Larken, our foreman, left five
  of us to watch thet far trail, up on top. He took the rest down."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"I seen them just now. I can show them to you."</p>

  <p>"Rustle. By gum, this is queer."</p>

  <p>"You can gamble on it," returned Cook as he turned his horse. "We got
  tired waitin' for a showdown. I disobeyed orders an' rode around this side.
  Glad I did For I run plumb across a trail fresh with tracks of a lot of
  horses. All shod! Brittenham, them hoss thieves have climbed out."</p>

  <p>"Another trail? Hell! If that's not tough...Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Heads in thet deep notch back of them cabins."</p>

  <p>"They had a back hole to their burrow. Nalook didn't know that."</p>

  <p>"Heah we air," said the cowboy, sliding off. "Come out on the rim."</p>

  <p>In another moment Dale was gazing down upon the grove of pines and the
  roofs of cabins. No men&mdash;no smoke! The campsite appeared deserted.</p>

  <p>"Say, what the hell you make of thet?" ejaculated the cowboy, pointing.
  "Look! Up behind the thicket, makin' for the open grass! There's Larkin's
  outfit all strung out, crawlin' on their bellies like snakes!"</p>

  <p>Dale saw, and in a flash he surmised that Stafford's men were crawling up
  on Strickland's. Each side would mistake the other for the horse thieves. And
  on the instant a clear crack of a rifle rang out. But it was up on the rim.
  Other shots, from heavy short guns, boomed. That cowboy had run into the
  spying outlaws. Again the sharp ring of the rifle.</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried the cowboy, pointing down.</p>

  <p>Dale saw puffs of blue smoke rise from the green level below. Then
  gunshots pealed up.</p>

  <p>"My Gawd! The locoed idiots are fightin' each other. But at that, neither
  Nalook or Strickland would know Stafford's outfit."</p>

  <p>"Bad! Let me ride down an' put them wise."</p>

  <p>"I'll go. Lend me your horse, you follow along the rim to the trail. Come
  down."</p>

  <p>Dale ran back to leap into the cowboy's saddle. The stirrups fit him. With
  a slap of the bridle and a kick he urged the horse into a gallop. It did not
  take long to reach the trail. Wheeling into it, he ran the horse out to the
  rim, and then sent him down at a sliding plunge. He yelled to the cowboy on
  guard. "Brittenham! Brittenham! Don't shoot!" Then, as the horse sent gravel
  and dust sky-high, and, reaching a level, sped by the cowboy, Dale added,
  "Look out for our men above!"</p>

  <p>Dale ran the fast horse along the edge of the timber and then toward the
  thicket where he calculated Nalook would lead Strickland. He crashed through
  one fringe of sage and laurel, right upon the heels of men. Rifles cracked to
  left and right. Dale heard the whistle of bullets that came from Stafford's
  outfit.</p>

  <p><i>"Stop!"</i> he yelled at the top of his lungs. "Horse thieves gone!
  You're fightin' our own men!"</p>

  <p>Out upon the open grass level he rode, tearing loose his scarf. He held
  this aloft in one hand and in the other his rifle. A puff of white smoke rose
  from the deep grass ahead, then another from a clump of brush to the right,
  and next, one directly in front of him. The missile from the gun which
  belched that smoke hissed close to Dale's ear. He yelled with all his might
  and waved as no attacking enemy ever would have done. But the shots
  multiplied. The cowboys did not grasp the situation.</p>

  <p>"No help for it!" muttered Dale with a dark premonition of calamity. But
  he had his good name to regain. He raced on right upon kneeling, lean-shaped
  cowboys.</p>

  <p><i>"Stop! Stop!</i> Horse thieves gone! You're fightin' friends! My
  outfit! Brittenham! Britt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dale felt the impact of a bullet on his body somewhere. Then a terrible
  blinding shock.</p>

  <p>When consciousness returned, Dale knew from a jolting sensation that he
  was being moved. He was being propped up in a saddle by a man riding on each
  side of his horse. His head sagged, and when he opened his eyes to a blurred
  and darkened sight, he saw the horn of his saddle and the mane of his horse.
  His skull felt as if it had been split by an ax.</p>

  <p>His senses drifted close to oblivion again, then recovered a little more
  clearly. He heard voices and hoofbeats. Warm blood dripped down on his hands.
  That sensation started conscious thought. He had been shot, but surely not
  fatally, or he would not have been put astraddle a horse. His reaction to
  that was swift, and revivifying with happiness. A faintness, a dizziness
  seemed to lessen, but the pain in his head grew correspondingly more
  piercing.</p>

  <p>Dale became aware then that a number of horsemen rode with him. They began
  to crash through brush out into the open again, where gray walls restricted
  the light. Then he felt strong hands lift him from the saddle and lay him on
  the grass. He opened his eyes. Anxious faces bent over him, one of which was
  Strickland's.</p>

  <p>"My Gawd, men!" came to Dale in Rogers's deep voice. "It's Brittenham!
  Don't say he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just knocked out temporarily," replied Strickland cheerfully. "Ugly scalp
  wound, but not dangerous. Another shot through the left shoulder. Fetch
  whiskey, bandages, hot water, and iodine if you have it."</p>

  <p>"Aw!" let out Rogers, expelling a loud breath. He thumped away.</p>

  <p>Dale lay with closed eyes, deeply grateful for having escaped serious
  injury. They forced him to swallow whiskey, and then they began to work over
  him.</p>

  <p>"You're the homesteader, Rogers?" Strickland queried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Me an' Britt have been friends. Knew each other over in the
  Sawtooths...Lord, I'm glad he ain't bad hurt. It'd just have killed thet
  Watrous girl."</p>

  <p>"I'm Strickland," replied the other. "These fellows here are part of a
  posse I brought up from Halsey."</p>

  <p>"Much of a fight? I heerd a lot of shootin'."</p>

  <p>"It would have been one hell of a fight but for Brittenham. You see, the
  horse-thief gang had vamoosed last night. But we didn't know that. The Indian
  led us up on an outfit that had discovered us about the same time, We were
  crawling toward each other, through the thickets and high grass. The Indian
  began to shoot first. That betrayed our position, and a lively exchange of
  shots began. It grew hot. Brittenham had gone up on the rim to scout. He
  discovered our blunder and rode back hell bent for election right into our
  midst. He stopped us, but the other outfit kept on shooting. Brittenham went
  on, and rode into the very face of hard shooting. He got hit twice. Nervy
  thing to do! But it saved lives. I had two men wounded besides him.
  Stafford's outfit suffered some casualties, but fortunately no one
  killed."</p>

  <p>"What become of the hoss thieves?"</p>

  <p>"Gone! After Reed and Mason had been killed, the gang evidently split.
  Some left in the night, leaving all their property except light packs. Sam
  Hood, one of Strickland's boys, killed two of them up on the rim, just before
  our fight started below."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Thet ought to bust the gang for keeps," declared Rogers, rubbing his
  big hands.</p>

  <p>"It was the best night's work this range ever saw. And the credit goes to
  Brittenham."</p>

  <p>"Wal, I'll go fetch the wimmin," concluded Rogers heartily.</p>

  <p>When, a little later, Dale had been washed and bandaged, and was half
  sitting up receiving the plaudits of the riders, he saw Edith come running
  out from under the trees into the open. She ran most of the way; then,
  nearing the cabin, she broke into a hurried walk and held a hand over her
  heart. Even at a distance Dale saw her big dark eyes, intent and staring in
  her pale face. As she neared the spot where he lay surrounded by a
  half-circle of strange men, it was certain she saw no one but him. Reaching
  the spot where he lay, she knelt beside him.</p>

  <p>"Dale!"</p>

  <p>"Hello...Edith," he replied huskily. "I guess I didn't bear such a charmed
  life...after all. I sure got in the way of two bullets. But my luck held,
  Edith."</p>

  <p>"Oh! You're not seriously injured?" she asked composedly, with a gentle
  hand on his. "But you are suffering."</p>

  <p>"My head did hurt like h&mdash;sixty. It's sort of whirlin' now."</p>

  <p>"Rogers told me, Dale. That was a wonderful and splendid thing for you to
  do," Edith said softly. "What will Dad say? And won't I have Mr. Stafford in
  a hole?"</p>

  <p>Strickland interposed with a beaming smile, "You sure will, Miss Watrous.
  And I hope you make the most of it."</p>

  <p>"Edith, I reckon we might leave for Bannock pronto," spoke up Dale
  eagerly. "I sent Nalook to tell your friends of your safety."</p>

  <p>"Wal, Dale, mebbe I'll let you go tomorrow," chimed in Rogers.</p>

  <p>"Don't go today," advised Strickland.</p>

  <p>Next day Dale, despite his iron will and supreme eagerness to get home,
  suffered an ordeal that was almost too much for him. Toward the end of the
  ride to Bannock, members of Strickland's posse were supporting Dale on his
  horse. But to his relief and Edith's poignant joy, he made it. At Bannock,
  medical attention and a good night's sleep made it possible for him to
  arrange to go on to Salmon by stage.</p>

  <p>The cowboy Cook, who had taken a strong fancy to Dale, and had hung close
  to him, came out of the inn carrying a canvas-covered pack that Dale had him
  carefully stow under the seat.</p>

  <p>"Britt, you sure have been keen about that pack. What's in it?" inquired
  Strickland with shrewd curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you like to know, old-timer?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a hunch. Wal, I'll look you up over at the Watrous ranch in a
  couple of days. I want to go home first."</p>

  <p>"Ahuh. You want to find out why those cowboy outfits didn't show up?"</p>

  <p>"I confess to a little curiosity," replied the rancher dryly. "Don't try
  to find out. Forget it," said Dale earnestly. The stage, full of passengers,
  and driven by the jovial stage driver Bill Edmunds, rolled away to the cheers
  of a Bannock crowd.</p>

  <p>"Dale, what <i>is</i> in this pack under the seat?" asked Edith.</p>

  <p>"Guess."</p>

  <p>"It looked heavy, and considering how fussy you've been about it, I'd
  say...<i>gold</i>," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Dale put his lips to her ear. "Edith, no wonder I'm fussy. I'm wild with
  excitement. That gang is broken up. An' I have Reed's money in my coat
  here&mdash;an' Mason's fortune in that pack."</p>

  <p>"Oh, how thrilling!" she whispered, and then on an afterthought she spoke
  out roguishly. "Well, in view of the...er...rather immediate surrender of
  your independence, I think I'd better take charge."</p>

  <p>Darkness had settled down over the Salmon River Valley when the stage
  arrived at Salmon. Old Bill, the driver, said to Edith, "I reckon I'd better
  hustle you young folks out home before the town hears what Britt has
  done."</p>

  <p>"Thad'd be good of you, Bill," replied Edith gratefully. "Dale is tired.
  And I'd be glad to get him home pronto."</p>

  <p>They were the only passengers for the three miles out to the ranch. Dale
  did not speak, and Edith appeared content to hold his hand. They both gazed
  out at the shining river and the dark groves, and over the moonlit range.
  When they arrived at the ranch, Dale had Bill turn down the lane to the
  little cabin where he lived.</p>

  <p>"Carry this pack in, Bill, an' don't ask questions, you son-of-a-gun, or
  you'll not get the twenty-dollar gold piece I owe you."</p>

  <p>"Wal, if this hyar pack is full of gold, you won't miss thet double eagle,
  you doggone lucky wild-hoss hunter."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Bill," said Edith. "I'll walk the rest of the way."</p>

  <p>Dale was left alone with Edith, who stood in the shadow of the maples with
  the moon lighting her lovely face. He could hear the low roar of rapids on
  the river.</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful, gettin' back, this way," he said haltingly. "You must run
  in an' tell your dad."</p>

  <p>"Dad can wait a moment longer...Oh, Dale, I'm so proud&mdash;so
  happy&mdash;my heart is bursting."</p>

  <p>"Mine feels queer, too. I hope this is not a dream, Edith."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>, Dale?"</p>

  <p>"Why, all that's happened&mdash;an' you standin' there safe
  again&mdash;an' so beautiful. You just don't appear real."</p>

  <p>"I should think you could ascertain whether I'm real flesh and blood or
  not."</p>

  <p>Dale fired to that. "You'll always be the same, Edith. Can't you see how
  serious this is for me?" He took her in his arms. "Darlin', I reckon I know
  how you feel. But no words can tell you my feelin's...Kiss me,
  Edith&mdash;then I'll try."</p>

  <p>She was in his arms, to grow responsive and loving in her eager return of
  his kisses.</p>

  <p>"Oh...Dale!" she whispered, with eyes closed. "I have found my man at
  last."</p>

  <p>"Edith, I love you...an' tomorrow I'll have the courage to ask your dad if
  I can have you."</p>

  <p>"Dale, I'm yours&mdash;Dad or no Dad. But he'll be as easy as that," she
  replied, stirring in his arms and snapping her fingers. "I hate to leave you.
  But we have tomorrow&mdash;and forever. Oh, Dale! I don't deserve all this
  happiness. Kiss me good night...I'll fetch your breakfast myself...Kiss me
  once more...<i>Another!</i> Oh, I am..."</p>

  <p>She broke from him to run up the lane and disappear under the moonlit
  maples. Dale stood there a few moments alone in the silver-blanched gloom,
  trying to persuade himself that he was awake and in possession of his
  senses.</p>

  <p>Next morning he got up early, to find the pain in his head much easier.
  But his shoulder was so stiff and sore that he could not use the arm on that
  side. Having only one hand available, he was sore beset by the difficulty of
  washing, shaving and making himself as presentable as possible.</p>

  <p>He did not get through any too soon, for Edith appeared up the lane
  accompanied by a servant carrying a tray. She saw him and waved, then came
  tripping on. Dale felt his heart swell and he moved about to hide his
  tremendous pride. He shoved a bench near the table under a canvas shelter
  that served for a porch. And when he could look up again, there she was,
  radiant in white.</p>

  <p>"Mornin', Edith. Now I believe in fairies again."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you look just fine. I'm having my breakfast with you. Do you feel as
  well as you look?"</p>

  <p>"Okay, except for my arm. It's stiff. I had a devil of a time puffin' my
  best foot forward. You'll have to do with a one-armed beau today."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have your one arm than all the two arms on the range," she
  replied gaily.</p>

  <p>They had breakfast together, which to Dale seemed like enchantment. Then
  she took him for a stroll under the cottonwoods out along the riverbank. And
  there, hanging on his good arm, she told him how her father had taken her
  story. Visitors from Salmon had come last night up to a late hour, and had
  begun to arrive already that morning. Stafford's outfit had returned driving
  a hundred recovered horses. Date's feat was on the tip of every tongue.</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell Dad about...about <i>us</i> till this morning," she added
  finally.</p>

  <p>"Lord help me! What'd he say?" gulped Dale.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it was flattering or not&mdash;to me," Edith replied
  dubiously. "He said, `That wild-horse tamer? Thank God, your hash is settled
  at last!"</p>

  <p>"He sure flatters me if he thinks I can tame you. Wait till I tell him how
  you routed Bayne's outfit!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dale, Dad was fine. He's going to ask you...But that'd be
  telling."</p>

  <p>"Edith, if he accepts me, must I...will I have to wait very long for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"<i>If</i>! Dad has accepted you, Dale. And honestly, he's happy over
  it...And as for the other&mdash;just what do you mean, Mr. Brittenham?"</p>

  <p>"Aw! Will you marry me soon?"</p>

  <p>"How soon?"</p>

  <p>"I...I don't know, darlin'."</p>

  <p>"Dale, dearest, I couldn't marry you with your head bandaged like
  that&mdash;or your arm in a sling," she said tantalizingly, as her dark eyes
  shed soft warm light upon him.</p>

  <p>"But Edith!" he burst out. "I could take them off pronto. In less than a
  week!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Just that pronto."</p>

  <p>Watrous came out to meet them as they crossed the green. His face showed
  emotion and his eyes, at that moment, had something of the fire of Edith's.
  He wrung Dale's hand. But as befitted a Westerner, a little trace of his deep
  feeling pervaded his voice.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham, I won't try to thank you," he said in simple heartiness.</p>

  <p>"That suits me, Mr. Watrous. I'm kind of overwhelmed An'...so I'd better
  get somethin' out before I lose my nerve...I've loved Edith since I came here
  first, three years ago. Will you give her to me?"</p>

  <p>"Dale, I will, and gladly, provided you live here with me. I'm getting on,
  and since Mother has been gone, Edith has been all to me."</p>

  <p>"Dad, we will never leave you," replied Edith softly.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, my children! And, Dale, there's a little matter I'd like to
  settle right now. I'll need a partner. Stafford has persuaded me to go in big
  for the cattle game. I see its possibilities. That, of course, means we'll
  have cattle stealing as we have had horse stealing. I'll need you pretty
  bad."</p>

  <p>"Dad!" cried Edith in dismay. "You didn't tell me you'd want Dale to go
  chasing cattle thieves!"</p>

  <p>"My dear, it might not come for years. Such developments come slowly. By
  that time Dale may have some grown cowboy sons to take his place."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Edith, plunged into sudden confusion. "Dale, do you
  accept?" added Watrous, extending his hand with an engaging smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Watrous. An' I'll give Edith an' you the best that's in me."</p>

  <p>"Settled! Oh, here comes Stafford. Lay into him, youngster, for he sure
  has been nasty."</p>

  <p>As Stafford came slowly down the broad steps, Dale found himself unable to
  feel the resentment that had rankled in him.</p>

  <p>"Brittenham," said the rancher as he advanced, "I've made blunders in my
  life, but never so stupid a one as that regarding you. I am ashamed and
  sorry. It'll be hard for me to live this injustice down unless you forgive
  me. Can I ask that of you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothin' to forgive," declared Dale earnestly, won by Stafford's
  straightforwardness and remorse. He offered his hand and gripped the
  rancher's. "Suspicion pointed at me. An' I took on Hildrith's guilt for
  reasons you know. Let's forget it an' be friends."</p>

  <p>"You are indeed a man."</p>

  <p>But when Stafford turned to Edith, he had a different proposition to face.
  She eyed him with disdainful scorn, and stood tapping a nervous foot on the
  path.</p>

  <p>"Edith, you can do no less than he. Say you forgive me, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, since Dale is so kind. But I think you are a rotten judge
  of men."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am, my dear."</p>

  <p>"And you're a hard man when you're crossed."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I'm a loyal friend. After all, this was a misunderstanding. You
  believed it, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I never did&mdash;not for a minute. That's why I followed Dale."</p>

  <p>"Well, you found him and brought him back." Stafford took a colored slip
  of paper from his pocket. He looked at it, then held it out to Edith. "I
  offered five thousand dollars' reward for Brittenham, dead or alive. You
  brought him back alive&mdash;very much alive, as anyone with half an eye
  could see. And no wonder! It seems to me that this reward should go to you.
  Indeed, I insist upon your taking it."</p>

  <p>"Reward! But, Mr. Stafford...you...I..." stammered Edith. "Five thousand
  dollars for <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Surely. I imagine you will be able to spend it pronto. We all know your
  weakness for fine clothes and fine horses. Please accept it as a wedding
  present from a friend who loves you and who will never cease to regret that
  he mistook so splendid and noble a fellow as Dale Brittenham for a horse
  thief!"</p>
