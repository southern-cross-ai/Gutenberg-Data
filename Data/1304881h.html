  <h2><a name="story01"
     id="story01">1. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Colonel Chartres Dane lingered irresolutely in the broad and
  pleasant lobby. Other patients had lingered awhile in that agreeable
  vestibule. In wintry days it was a cozy place; its polished panelled walls
  reflecting the gleam of logs that burnt in the open fireplace. There was a
  shining oak settle that invited gossip, and old prints, and blue china bowls
  frothing over with the flowers of a belated autumn or advanced spring-tide,
  to charm the eye.</p>

  <p>In summer it was cool and dark and restful. The mellow tick of the ancient
  clock, the fragrance of roses, the soft breeze that came through an open
  casement stirring the lilac curtains uneasily, these corollaries of peace and
  order had soothed many an unquiet mind.</p>

  <p>Colonel Chartres Dane fingered a button of his light dust-coat and his
  thin patrician face was set in thought. He was a spare man of fifty-five; a
  man of tired eyes and nervous gesture.</p>

  <p>Dr. Merriget peered at him through his powerful spectacles and
  wondered.</p>

  <p>It was an awkward moment, for the doctor had murmured his sincere, if
  conventional, regrets and encouragements, and there was nothing left but to
  close the door on his patient.</p>

  <p>"You have had a bad wound there, Mr. Jackson," he said, by way of changing
  a very gloomy subject and filling in the interval of silence. This
  intervention might call to mind in a soldier some deed of his, some far field
  of battle where men met death with courage and fortitude. Such memories might
  be helpful to a man under sentence.</p>

  <p>Colonel Dane fingered the long scar on his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said absently, "a child did that&mdash;my niece. Quite my own
  fault."</p>

  <p>"A child?" Dr. Merriget appeared to be shocked. He was in reality very
  curious.</p>

  <p>"Yes... she was eleven... my own fault. I spoke disrespectfully of her
  father. It was unpardonable, for he was only recently dead. He was my
  brother-in-law. We were at breakfast and she threw the knife... yes...."</p>

  <p>He ruminated on the incident and a smile quivered at the corner of his
  thin lips.</p>

  <p>"She hated me. She hates me still... yes...."</p>

  <p>He waited.</p>

  <p>The doctor was embarrassed and came back to the object of the visit.</p>

  <p>"I should be ever so much more comfortable in my mind if you saw a
  specialist, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Jackson. You see how difficult it is for me to
  give an opinion? I may be wrong. I know nothing of your history, your medical
  history I mean. There are so many men in town who could give you a better and
  more valuable opinion than I. A country practitioner like myself is rather in
  a backwater. One has the usual cases that come to one in a small country
  town, maternity cases, commonplace ailments... it is difficult to keep
  abreast of the extraordinary developments in medical science...."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about Machonicies College?" asked the colonel
  unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course." The doctor was surprised. "It is one of the best of the
  technical schools. Many of our best doctors and chemists take a preparatory
  course there. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I merely asked. As to your specialists... I hardly think I shall bother
  them."</p>

  <p>Dr. Merriget watched the tall figure striding down the red-tiled path
  between the banked flowers, and was still standing on the doorstep when the
  whine of his visitor's machine had gone beyond the limits of his hearing.</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Dr. Merriget as he returned to his study. He sat awhile
  thinking.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jackson?" he said aloud. "I wonder why the colonel calls himself 'Mr.
  Jackson'?"</p>

  <p>He had seen the colonel two years before at a garden party, and had an
  excellent memory for faces.</p>

  <p>He gave the matter no further thought, having certain packing to
  superintend&mdash;he was on the eve of his departure for Constantinople, a
  holiday trip he had promised himself for years.</p>

  <p>On the following afternoon at Machonicies Technical School, a lecture was
  in progress.</p>

  <p>"... by this combustion you have secured true K.c.y.... which we will now
  test and compare with the laboratory quantities... a deliquescent and
  colorless crystal extremely soluble...."</p>

  <p>The master, whose monotonous voice droned like the hum of a distant, big,
  stationary blue-bottle, was a middle-aged man, to whom life was no more than
  a chemical reaction, and love not properly a matter for his observation or
  knowledge. He had an idea that it was dealt with effectively in another
  department of the college... metaphysics... or was it philosophy? Or maybe it
  came into the realms of the biological master?</p>

  <p>Ella Grant glared resentfully at the crystals which glittered on the blue
  paper before her, and snapped out the bunsen burner with a vicious twist of
  finger and thumb. Denman always overshot the hour. It was a quarter past
  five! The pallid clock above the dais, where Professor Denman stood, seemed
  to mock her impatience.</p>

  <p>She sighed wearily and fiddled with the apparatus on the bench at which
  she sat. Some twenty other white-coated girls were also fiddling with test
  tubes and bottles and graduated measures, and twenty pairs of eyes glowered
  at the bald and stooping man who, unconscious of the passing of time, was
  turning affectionately to the properties of potassium.</p>

  <p>"Here we have a metal whose strange affinity for oxygen... eh, Miss
  Benson?... five? Bless my soul, so it is! Class is dismissed. And ladies,
  <i>ladies, ladies!</i> Please, please let me make myself heard. The
  laboratory keeper will take from you all chemicals you have drawn for this
  experiment...."</p>

  <p>They were crowding toward the door to the change room. Smith, the
  laboratory man, stood in the entrance grabbing wildly at little green and
  blue bottles that were thrust at him, and vainly endeavoring by a private
  system of mnemonics to commit his receipts to memory.</p>

  <p>"Miss Fairlie, phial fairly; Miss Jones, bottle bones; Miss Walter, bottle
  salter."</p>

  <p>If at the end of his collection he failed to recall a rhyme to any name,
  the owner had passed without cashing in.</p>

  <p>"Miss Grant&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>The laboratory of the Analytical Class was empty. Nineteen bottles stood
  on a shelf and he reviewed them.</p>

  <p>"Miss Grant&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>No, he had said nothing about "aunt" or "can't" or "pant."</p>

  <p>He went into the change room, opened a locker and felt in the pockets of
  the white overall. They were empty. Returning to the laboratory, he wrote in
  his report book:</p>

  <p>"Miss Grant did not return experiment bottle."</p>

  <p>He spelt experiment with two r's and two m's.</p>

  <p>Ella found the bottle in the pocket of her overall as she was hanging it
  up in the long cupboard of the change room. She hesitated a moment, frowning
  resentfully at the little blue phial in her hand, and rapidly calculating the
  time it would take to return to the laboratory to find the keeper and restore
  the property. In the end, she pushed it into her bag and hurried from the
  building. It was not an unusual occurrence that a student overlooked the
  return of some apparatus, and it could be restored in the morning.</p>

  <p>Had Jack succeeded? That was the thought which occupied her. The miracle
  about which every junior dreams had happened. Engaged in the prosecution of
  the notorious Flackman, his leader had been taken ill, and the conduct of the
  case for the State had fallen to him. He was opposed by two brilliant
  advocates, and the judge was a notorious humanitarian.</p>

  <p>She did not stop to buy a newspaper; she was in a fret at the thought that
  Jack Freeder might not have waited for her, and she heaved a sigh of relief
  when she turned into the old-world garden of the courthouse and saw him
  pacing up and down the flagged walk, his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry...."</p>

  <p>She had come up behind him, and he turned on his heel to meet her. His
  face spoke success. The elation in it told her everything she wanted to know,
  and she slipped her arm through his with a queer mingled sense of pride and
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"... the judge sent for me to his room afterwards and told me that the
  attorney could not have conducted the case better than I."</p>

  <p>"He is guilty?" she asked, hesitating.</p>

  <p>"Who, Flackman... I suppose so," he said carelessly. "His pistol was found
  in Sinnit's apartment, and it was known that he quarrelled with Sinnit about
  money, and there was a girl in it, I think, although we have never been able
  to get sufficient proof of that to put her into the box. You seldom have
  direct evidence in cases of this character, Ella, and in many ways
  circumstantial evidence is infinitely more damning. If a witness went into
  the box and said, 'I saw Flackman shoot Sinnit and saw Sinnit die,' the whole
  case would stand or fall by the credibility of that evidence; prove that
  witness an habitual liar and there is no chance of a conviction. On the other
  hand, when there are six or seven witnesses, all of whom subscribe to some
  one act or appearance or location of a prisoner, and all agreeing... why, you
  have him."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>Her acquaintance with Jack Freeder had begun on her summer vacation, and
  had begun romantically but unconventionally, when a sailing boat overturned,
  with its occupant pinned beneath the bulging canvas. It was Ella, a
  magnificent swimmer, who, bathing, had seen the accident and had dived into
  the sea to the assistance of the drowning man.</p>

  <p>"This means a lot to me, Ella," he said earnestly as they turned into the
  busy street. "It means the foundation of a new life."</p>

  <p>His eyes met hers, and lingered for a second, and she was thrilled.</p>

  <p>"Did you see Stephanie last night?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>She felt guilty.</p>

  <p>"No," she admitted, "but I don't think you ought to worry about that,
  Jack. Stephanie is expecting the money almost by any mail."</p>

  <p>"She has been expecting the money almost by any mail for a month past," he
  said dryly, "and in the meantime this infernal note is becoming due. What I
  can't understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"You can't understand why they accepted my signature as a guarantee for
  Stephanie's," she laughed, "and you are extremely uncomplimentary!"</p>

  <p>Stephanie Boston, her some-time room mate, and now her apartmental
  neighbor, was a source of considerable worry to Jack Freeder, although he had
  only met her once. A handsome, volatile girl, with a penchant for good
  clothes and a mode of living out of all harmony with the meager income she
  drew from fashion-plate artistry, she had found herself in difficulties. It
  was a condition which the wise had long predicted, and Ella, not so wise, had
  dreaded. And then one day the young artist had come to her with an oblong
  slip of paper, and an incoherent story of somebody being willing to lend her
  money if Ella would sign her name; and Ella Grant, to whom finance was an
  esoteric mystery, had cheerfully complied.</p>

  <p>"If you were a great heiress, or you were expecting a lot of money coming
  to you through the death of a relative," persisted Jack, with a frown, "I
  could understand Isaacs being satisfied with your acceptance, but you
  aren't!"</p>

  <p>Ella laughed softly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The only relative I have in the world is poor dear Uncle Chartres, who
  loathes me! I used to loathe him too, but I've got over that. After daddy
  died I lived with him for a few months, but we quarrelled
  over&mdash;over&mdash;well, I won't tell you what it was about, because I am
  sure he was sorry. I had a fiendish temper as a child, and I threw a knife at
  him."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" gasped Jack, staring at her.</p>

  <p>She nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>"I did&mdash;so you see there is very little likelihood of Uncle Chartres,
  who is immensely rich, leaving me anything more substantial than the horrid
  weapon with which I attempted to slay him!"</p>

  <p>Jack was silent. Isaacs was a professional moneylender... he was not a
  philanthropist.</p>

  <p>When Ella got home that night she determined to perform an unpleasant
  duty. She had not forgotten Jack Freeder's urgent insistence upon her seeing
  Stephanie Boston&mdash;she had simply avoided the unpalatable.</p>

  <p>Stephanie's flat was on the first floor; her own was immediately above.
  She considered for a long time before she pressed the bell.</p>

  <p>Grace, Stephanie's elderly maid, opened the door, and her eyes were red
  with recent weeping.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" asked Ella in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Come in, miss," said the servant miserably. "Miss Boston left a letter
  for you."</p>

  <p>"Left?" repeated Ella wonderingly. "Has she gone away?"</p>

  <p>"She was gone when I came this morning. The bailiffs have been
  here...."</p>

  <p>Ella's heart sank.</p>

  <p>The letter was short but eminently lucid:</p>

  <p class="letter">
  "I am going away, Ella. I do hope that you will forgive me. That wretched
  bill has become due and I simply cannot face you again. I will work
  desperately hard to repay you, Ella."</p>

  <p>The girl stared at the letter, not realizing what it all meant. Stephanie
  had gone away!</p>

  <p>"She took all her clothes, miss. She left this morning, and told the
  porter she was going into the country; and she owes me three weeks'
  wages!"</p>

  <p>Ella went upstairs to her own flat, dazed and shaken. She herself had no
  maid; a woman came every morning to clean the flat, and Ella had her meals at
  a neighboring restaurant.</p>

  <p>As she made the last turn of the stairs she was conscious that there was a
  man waiting on the landing above, with his back to her door. Though she did
  not know him, he evidently recognized her, for he raised his hat. She had a
  dim idea that she had seen him somewhere before, but for the moment could not
  recollect the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Miss Grant," he said amiably. "I think we have met before.
  Miss Boston introduced me&mdash;name of Higgins."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't remember you," she said, and wondered whether his
  business was in connection with Stephanie's default.</p>

  <p>"I brought the paper up that you signed about three months ago."</p>

  <p>Then she recalled him and went cold.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Isaacs didn't want to make any kind of trouble," he said. "The bill
  became due a week ago and we have been trying to get Miss Boston to pay. As
  it is, it looks very much as though you will have to find the money."</p>

  <p>"When?" she asked in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Isaacs will give you until to tomorrow night," said the man. "I have
  been waiting here since five o'clock to see you. I suppose it is convenient,
  miss?"</p>

  <p>Nobody knew better than Mr. Isaacs' clerk that it would be most
  inconvenient, not to say impossible, for Ella Grant to produce four hundred
  pounds.</p>

  <p>"I will write to Mr. Isaacs," she said, finding her voice at last.</p>

  <p>She sat down in the solitude and dusk of her flat to think things out. She
  was overwhelmed, numbed by the tragedy. To owe money that she could not pay
  was to Ella Grant an unspeakable horror.</p>

  <p>There was a letter in the letter-box. She had taken it out mechanically
  when she came in, and as mechanically slipped her fingers through the flap
  and extracted a folded paper. But she put it down without so much as a glance
  at its contents.</p>

  <p>What would Jack say? What a fool she had been, what a perfectly reckless
  fool! She had met difficulties before, and had overcome them. When she had
  left her uncle's house as a child of fourteen and had subsisted on the
  slender income which her father had left her, rejecting every attempt on the
  part of Chartres Dane to make her leave the home of an invalid maiden aunt
  where she had taken refuge, she had faced what she believed was the supreme
  crisis of life.</p>

  <p>But this was different.</p>

  <p>Chartres Dane! She rejected the thought instantly, only to find it
  recurring. Perhaps he would help. She had long since overcome any ill-
  feeling she had towards him, for whatever dislike she had, had been replaced
  by a sense of shame and repentance. She had often been on the point of
  writing him to beg his forgiveness, but had stopped short at the thought that
  he might imagine she had some ulterior motive in seeking to return to his
  good graces. He was her relative. He had some responsibility ... again the
  thought inserted itself, and suddenly she made up her mind.</p>

  <p>Chartres Dane's house lay twelve miles out of town, a great rambling place
  set on the slopes of a wooded hill, a place admirably suited to his peculiar
  love of solitude.</p>

  <p>She had some difficulty in finding a taxi-driver who was willing to make
  the journey, and it had grown dark, though a pale light still lingered in the
  western skies, when she descended from the cab at the gateway of Hevel House.
  There was a lodge at the entrance of the gate, but this had long since been
  untenanted. She found her way up the long drive to the columned portico in
  front of the house. The place was in darkness, and she experienced a pang of
  apprehension. Suppose he was not there? (Even if he were, he would not help
  her, she told herself.) But the possibility of his being absent, however,
  gave her courage.</p>

  <p>Her hand was on the bell when there came to her a flash of memory. At such
  an hour he would be sitting in the window-recess overlooking the lawn at the
  side of the house. She had often seen him there on warm summer nights, his
  glass of port on the broad window-ledge, a cigar clenched between his white
  teeth, brooding out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>She came down the steps, and walking on the close-cropped grass bordering
  the flower-beds, came slowly, almost stealthily, to the library window. The
  big casement was wide open; a faint light showed within, and she stopped
  dead, her heart beating a furious rat-a-plan at the sight of a filled glass
  on the window-ledge. His habits had not changed, she thought; he himself
  would be sitting just out of sight from where she stood, in that
  window-recess which was nearest to her. Summoning all her courage, she
  advanced still farther. He was not in his customary place, and she crept
  nearer to the window.</p>

  <p>Colonel Chartres Dane was sitting at a large writing-table in the center
  of the room; his back was toward her, and he was writing by the light of two
  tall candles that stood upon the table.</p>

  <p>At the sight of his back all her courage failed, and, as he rose from the
  table, she shrank back into the shadow. She saw his white hand take up the
  glass of wine, and after a moment, peeping again, she saw him, still with his
  back to her, put it on the table by him as he sat down again.</p>

  <p>She could not do it, she dare not do it, she told herself, and turned away
  sorrowfully. She would write to him.</p>

  <p>She had stepped from the grass to the path when a man came from an opening
  in the bushes and gripped her arm.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he said, "who are you, and what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Let me go," she cried, frightened. "I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What are you doing by the colonel's window?"</p>

  <p>"I am his niece," she said, trying to recover some of her dignity.</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be his aunt," said the gamekeeper ironically. "Now,
  my girl, I am going to take you in to the colonel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a violent thrust she pushed him from her; the man stumbled and fell.
  She heard a thud and a groan, and stood rooted to the spot with horror.</p>

  <p>"Have I hurt you?" she whispered. There was no reply.</p>

  <p>She felt, rather than saw, that he had struck his head against a tree in
  falling, and turning, she flew down the drive, terrified, nearly fainting in
  her fright. The cabman saw her as she flung open the gate and rushed out.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I think I have killed a man," she said incoherently, and then
  from the other end of the drive she heard a thick voice cry:</p>

  <p>"Stop that girl!"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of the gamekeeper, and for a moment the blood came back
  to her heart.</p>

  <p>"Take me away, quickly, quickly," she cried.</p>

  <p>The cabman hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Take&mdash;take me away," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>Again he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Jump in," he said gruffly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Three weeks later John Penderbury, one of the greatest advocates at the
  Bar, walked into Jack Freeder's chambers.</p>

  <p>The young man sat at his table, his head on his arm, and Penderbury put
  his hand lightly upon the shoulders of the stricken man.</p>

  <p>"You've got to take a hold of yourself, Freeder," he said kindly. "You
  will neither help yourself nor her by going under."</p>

  <p>Jack lifted a white, haggard face to the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"It is horrible, horrible," he said huskily. "She's as innocent as a baby.
  What evidence have they?"</p>

  <p>"My dear good fellow," said Penderbury, "the only evidence worth while in
  a case like this is circumstantial evidence. If there were direct evidence we
  might test the credibility of the witness. But in circumstantial evidence
  every piece of testimony dovetails into the other; each witness creates one
  strand of the net."</p>

  <p>"It is horrible, it is impossible, it is madness to think that Ella
  could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Penderbury shook his head. Pulling up a chair at the other side of the
  table, he sat down, his arms folded, his grave eyes fixed on the younger
  man.</p>

  <p>"Look at it from a lawyer's point of view, Freeder," he said gently. "Ella
  Grant is badly in need of money. She has backed a bill for a girl-friend and
  the money is suddenly demanded. A few minutes after learning this from
  Isaacs' clerk, she finds a letter in her flat, which she has obviously
  read&mdash;the envelope was opened and its contents extracted&mdash;a letter
  which is from Colonel Dane's lawyers, telling her that the colonel has made
  her his sole heiress. She knows, therefore, that the moment the colonel dies
  she will be a rich woman. She has in her handbag a bottle containing cyanide
  of potassium, and that night, under the cover of darkness, drives to the
  colonel's house and is seen outside the library window by Colonel Dane's
  gamekeeper. She admitted, when she was questioned by the detective, that she
  knew the colonel was in the habit of sitting by the window and that he
  usually put his glass of port on the window-ledge. What was easier than to
  drop a fatal dose of cyanide into the wine? Remember, she admitted that she
  had hated him and that once she threw a knife at him, wounding him, so that
  the scar remained to the day of his death. She admitted herself that it was
  his practice to put the wine where she could have reached it."</p>

  <p>He drew a bundle of papers from his pocket, unfolded them, and turned the
  leaves rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," and he read:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw a glass of wine on the window-ledge. The colonel was in the
  habit of sitting in the window on summer evenings. I have often seen him
  there, and I knew when I saw the wine that he was near at hand."</p>

  <p>He pushed the paper aside and looked keenly at the wretched man before
  him.</p>

  <p>"She is seen by the gamekeeper, as I say," he went on, "and this man,
  attempting to intercept her, she struggles from his grasp and runs down the
  drive to the cab. The cabman says she was agitated, and when he asked her
  what was the matter, she replied that she had killed a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She meant the gamekeeper," interrupted Jack.</p>

  <p>"She may or may not, but she made that statement. There are the facts,
  Jack; you cannot get past them. The letter from the lawyers&mdash;which she
  says she never read&mdash;the envelope was found open and the letter taken
  out; is it likely that she had not read it? The bottle of cyanide of
  potassium was found in her possession, and&mdash;" he spoke
  deliberately&mdash;"the colonel was found dead at his desk and death was due
  to cyanide of potassium. A candle which stood on his desk had been overturned
  by him in his convulsions, and the first intimation the servants had that
  anything was wrong was the sight of the blazing papers on the table, which
  the gamekeeper saw when he returned to report what had occurred in the
  grounds. There is no question what verdict the jury will return...."</p>

  <p>It was a great and a fashionable trial. The courthouse was crowded, and
  the public had fought for a few places that were vacant in the gallery.</p>

  <p>Sir Johnson Grey, the Attorney-General, was to lead for the Prosecution,
  and Penderbury had Jack Freeder as his junior.</p>

  <p>The opening trial was due for ten o'clock, but it was half-past ten when
  the Attorney-General and Penderbury came into the court, and there was a
  light in Penderbury's eyes and a smile on his lips which amazed his
  junior.</p>

  <p>Jack had only glanced once at the pale, slight prisoner. He dared not look
  at her.</p>

  <p>"What is the delay?" he asked irritably. "This infernal judge is always
  late."</p>

  <p>At that moment the court rose as the judge came on to the Bench, and
  almost immediately afterwards the Attorney-General was addressing the
  court.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said, "I do not purpose offering any evidence in this case
  on behalf of the Crown. Last night I received from Dr. Merriget, an eminent
  practitioner of Townville, a sworn statement on which I purpose examining
  him.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Merriget," the Attorney-General went on, "has been traveling in the
  Near East, and a letter which was sent to him by the late Colonel Dane only
  reached him a week ago, coincident with the doctor learning that these
  proceedings had been taken against the prisoner at the bar.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Merriget immediately placed himself in communication with the Crown
  officers of the law, as a result of which I am in a position to tell your
  lordship that I do not intend offering evidence against Ella Grant.</p>

  <p>"Apparently Colonel Dane had long suspected that he was suffering from an
  incurable disease, and to make sure, he went to Dr. Merriget and submitted
  himself to an examination. The reason for his going to a strange doctor is,
  that he did not want to have it known that he had been consulting specialists
  in town. The doctor confirmed his worst fears, and Colonel Dane returned to
  his home. Whilst on the Continent, the doctor received a letter from Colonel
  Dane, which I purpose reading."</p>

  <p>He took a letter from the table, adjusted his spectacles, and read:</p>

  <p>"DEAR DR. MERRIGET,&mdash;It occurred to me after I had left you the day
  before yesterday, that you must have identified me, for I have a dim
  recollection that we met at a garden party. I am not, as you suggested,
  taking any other advice. I know too well that this fibrous growth is beyond
  cure, and I purpose tonight taking a fatal dose of cyanide of potassium. I
  feel that I must notify you in case by a mischance there is some question as
  to how I met my death.&mdash;Very sincerely yours, "CHARTRES DANE."</p>

  <p>"I feel that the ends of justice will be served," continued the
  Attorney-General "if I call the doctor...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was not very long before another Crown case came the way of Jack
  Freeder. A week after his return from his honeymoon, he was sent for to the
  Public Prosecutor's office, and that gentleman interviewed him.</p>

  <p>"You did so well in the Flackman case, Freeder, that I want you to
  undertake the prosecution of Wise. Undoubtedly you will gain kudos in a trial
  of this description, for the Wise case has attracted a great deal of
  attention."</p>

  <p>"What is the evidence?" asked Jack bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Circumstantial, of course," said the Public Prosecutor, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think not, sir," he said firmly but respectfully. "I will not prosecute
  in another case of murder unless the murder is committed in my presence."</p>

  <p>The Public Prosecutor stared at him.</p>

  <p>"That means you will never take another murder prosecution&mdash;have you
  given up criminal work, Mr. Freeder?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Jack gravely; "my wife doesn't like it."</p>

  <p>Today, Jack Freeder is referred to in legal circles as a glaring example
  of how a promising career can be ruined by marriage.</p>

  <h2><a name="story02"
     id="story02">2. FIGHTING SNUB REILLY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ten minutes before Snub Reilly left his dressing-room a
  messenger delivered a letter. His seconds and his manager protested against
  his reading anything which might well be disturbing at such a critical
  moment, for the little man was fighting for his title, and Curly Boyd, the
  aspirant to championship honors, had knocked out four successive opponents
  before he claimed his right to a meeting with the World Champion.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it," said Snub, and he was something of an autocrat. The
  letter was typewritten and was signed by two reputable men whose names were
  honored in the sporting world.</p>

  <p>Snub read the letter slowly.</p>

  <p>"A challenge," he said tersely, "for £10,000 a side."</p>

  <p>"Who is the feller?" asked his manager.</p>

  <p>"They call him 'An Unknown'; he wants to meet the winner of tonight's
  fight. Send a wire and say I accept."</p>

  <p>His manager grinned. He was a stout man with a moist face, and he had
  infinite confidence in Snub, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Better wait till after the fight?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Send it," said Snub curtly, and put on his dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>Manager Seller dispatched the wire, not without some discomfort of mind.
  The fourth round brought him relief.</p>

  <p>Curly Boyd, an approved European champion, had himself to thank for such
  an early ending to his rosy dreams. He had detected, as he thought, a certain
  unsteadiness in Snub's leg movements, an uncertainty that was a hint of a
  stagger. So Curly, relying upon his excellent fitness, had put everything
  into a projected left and right. Incidentally he was fighting the greatest
  ring strategist of his day, and when he uncovered his jaw for the fraction of
  a second....</p>

  <p>"Eight... nine... ten&mdash;out!" said a far-away voice in Curly's ear.
  Somebody shook him by his gloved hand, and he heard above the roaring in his
  head a louder roar, and dropped his head wearily to catch a glimpse of a
  figure in a flowered dressing-gown slipping through the gangway into the
  gloom behind the ring seats.</p>

  <p>It was a fine thing for Snub, because the eyes of the world were on that
  fight&mdash;outside the building limousines were parked twenty deep&mdash;and
  before he reached his dressing-room the news of his victory was quivering in
  dots and dashes on every line and cable that ran from the city.</p>

  <p>He stripped off his dressing-gown and submitted to the attentions of the
  masseur with some sign of impatience. Ten minutes after the fight he left the
  building by a side door, and mingled with the thousands who crowded about the
  entrances. Modesty was Snub Reilly's favorite vice.</p>

  <p>The echoes of such a combat were not to die down in a day, for Snub was
  something of a national hero. This champion who never gave interviews, who
  was so taciturn and secretive that his very seconds did not meet him until
  the day before his fights, appealed to the popular imagination as no other
  ring favorite had done. And when, at the end of the press description, it was
  announced that "An Unknown" had challenged the winner for a purse of $50,000
  (£10,000), and the challenge had been accepted, there was an added value to
  the news.</p>

  <p>Even staid and sleepy Rindle, dedicated to the education of youth, was
  excited, wildly excited for Rindle. The headmaster read the account of the
  fight at breakfast and hummed and ha'd his approval of the lightning stroke
  which laid the presumptuous Curly Boyd so low. And on the opposite side of
  the breakfast table Vera Shaw, nineteen and beautiful, hid a newspaper on her
  lap, read furtively and was thrilled. A group of boys <i>en route</i> from
  their dormitories-houses to prayers and morning school, gathered about one
  daring soul who had broken all school regulations by purchasing forbidden
  literature, and whooped joyously.</p>

  <p>It was natural that Barry Tearle, the mathematical master, should stop in
  the midst of correcting exercises, hitch up his gown at the neck for comfort,
  and sit back to study the account. Natural, because he was also games master
  and instructor of the noble art to Rindle School.</p>

  <p>He put down the paper with a thoughtful frown and went back to his
  exercises, lighting his pipe mechanically the while. Presently he gathered
  the papers together and rose. The bell was clanging the warning for prayers
  in Hall, at which solemn function all masters were expected to be present. He
  hurried across the quadrangle-campus and under the archway above which was
  part of the head's quarters. He never passed under that arch without
  wondering whether Vera owned those rooms. It was part of the daily routine of
  unconscious speculation, and he was so wondering as he turned to join the
  stream of boys on the flagged path to Hall, when he heard his name
  called.</p>

  <p>He turned quickly, startled almost, and swept off his cap.</p>

  <p>It was the subject of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I saw you come home this morning."</p>

  <p>She pointed an accusing finger and he blushed.</p>

  <p>"Did&mdash;did you? My car had a breakdown near Northwood&mdash;I hope I
  didn't disturb you?"</p>

  <p>No errant boy called to his study to explain a delinquency could have
  looked more patently guilty than he, and she laughed, and when Vera Shaw
  laughed, it required all his self-possession to behave sanely.</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't disturb me. I couldn't sleep and was sitting at the window
  approving of the moon when you sneaked into the quad&mdash;there is no other
  word for it. Did you see the fight?" she asked suddenly, and he gasped.</p>

  <p>"No, I did <i>not</i> see the fight," he said severely; "and I'm
  surprised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" She flicked her finger at him. "I've read every bit about it. Do
  tell me who is 'An Unknown' who is going to fight that darling
  Snub&mdash;run, you'll be late!"</p>

  <p>The bell had stopped, the trembling note of the organ quivered in the
  still air, and Barry gathered up his gown and sprinted. He hoped she would be
  waiting when chapel ended, and was the first to leave after the final "amen."
  She was standing where he had left her, but Sellinger was with her, and,
  forgetful of the admirable charity toward all men which he had so recently
  intoned, Barry cursed Sellinger most heartily.</p>

  <p>John Sellinger lived in Rindle; his ancestors had founded Rindle School,
  and he himself assumed the style and manner and mental attitude of hereditary
  patron saint to the school. He was tall, overtopping Barry by six inches,
  florid, well fed, and prosperous. He was good-looking too, in a heavy,
  aquiline way. And he made no secret that his patronage of Rindle might extend
  to acquiring relationship with its headmaster.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Tearle. I suppose you didn't see the fight?"</p>

  <p>"No, I <i>didn't</i> see the fight," said Barry savagely. "Have I nothing
  better to do&mdash;did you?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, rather&mdash;I was just telling Vera all about it. Wonderful fellow,
  Reilly. Smaller even than you."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible?" asked Barry, affecting an extravagant surprise. "Could
  you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be sarcastic," said Mr. Sellinger. "Of course you could see
  him&mdash;you don't see much of him from where I sat, he doesn't stand still
  long enough, but, boy, he's a fighter!"</p>

  <p>"So the papers say," said Barry wearily.</p>

  <p>"As to the unknown idiot who wants to fight him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said Barry shortly, and with a lift of his hat went
  on.</p>

  <p>"Curious fellow that." Sellinger shook his head. "Can't quite make him
  out, Vera."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sellinger." Her tone was very quiet.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Vera?"</p>

  <p>"Will you please not call me by my Christian name?"</p>

  <p>He was surprised and hurt.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I'm not your dear child," she said in the same voice. "I'm not even a
  child."</p>

  <p>He drew himself erect, for he was a Sellinger of Rindle; and Sellingers of
  Rindle have drawn themselves erect for several centuries at the mere
  suggestion that they could not do just what their sweet fancy dictated.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you wish it, Ve&mdash;Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Shaw; by all
  means. I'm sorry if I've offended you."</p>

  <p>He was not sorry except for himself, of course; but it was the kind of
  reply that a representative of the oldest family in the county should
  make.</p>

  <p>"You haven't offended me&mdash;only I don't like it. Why do you think that
  Mr. Tearle is curious?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he hesitated, "a schoolmaster isn't the best paid professional in
  the world, and yet Tearle lives in style, has a car of his own, is always
  dressed well."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in that weary, patient way which women can make so
  offensive.</p>

  <p>"Other people have money&mdash;you have money, and yet it isn't curious,"
  she said coldly. "Or do you think it is curious because you haven't got it
  all?"</p>

  <p>He smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"How like you to defend him!" he said, and before indignation could permit
  an appropriate reply he went on: "Did your father say whether the School
  Extension Committee was meeting at the usual hour?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and half turned to go.</p>

  <p>"I wish&mdash;" he began, and stopped.</p>

  <p>"You wish?"</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;this time his halt of speech was less natural&mdash;"I wish
  that other arrangements would be made about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About what?" She was exasperated by his studied hesitations, but she was
  curious.</p>

  <p>"About the money that has been raised for the school extension. It is a
  tremendous sum for a&mdash;well, for an ill-paid master to handle."</p>

  <p>He knew he had made a mistake before the words were out, for the girl's
  face had gone from crimson to white as the drift of his meaning appeared.</p>

  <p>"Do you"&mdash;she was breathless, and her voice sounded strange even to
  her&mdash;"do you&mdash;mean to suggest that Mr. Tearle&mdash;gets his money
  for motor-cars... oh, it's too absurd&mdash;too wicked&mdash;how dare
  you!"</p>

  <p>He blinked at her in amazement. He had never regarded her as anything but
  a soft, fluffy, kitteny thing, and a possible ornament to his gloomy house.
  He looked aghast upon a fury; her gray eyes, dark with passion, her lips
  straight drawn and unbecoming. That is the impression he carried away with
  him&mdash;her mouth was unbecoming in anger.</p>

  <p>"My dear&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You must have an evil mind to think such things," she flamed. "I hate
  you!"</p>

  <p>He stood as a man petrified until she had disappeared through the porch of
  Dr. Shaw's study. Then he pulled up his collar, and stalked haughtily through
  the schoolhouse gate.</p>

  <p>"Very unbecoming," he spluttered to himself. "Very unladylike... very
  unnecessary...."</p>

  <p>Vera Shaw saw him depart from the window of her bedroom, and made faces at
  him which were unbecoming and certainly unladylike. Then she sat on the edge
  of her bed and wept bitterly. Which was unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Dr. Shaw came into lunch ten minutes earlier than she had expected, and
  brought Sellinger with him, to the girl's intense annoyance.</p>

  <p>"I've asked Sellinger to stay to lunch, Vera," he said. "Will you tell
  Mrs. Burdon to put another place at the table? We have a meeting of the
  Extension Committee this afternoon, and I cannot send Mr. Sellinger all the
  way back."</p>

  <p>A more sensitive man than Sellinger might have been hurt by the apology
  for his invitation; but Sellinger was not that kind of man. He smiled
  graciously upon the girl, and in that smile conveyed a tacit agreement that
  what had happened that morning should be overlooked and forgotten.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Vera, there was little need for her to speak, for the
  conversation centered about the afternoon committee meeting. She was alert
  for any comment which might be remotely disparaging to Barry Tearle; but Mr.
  Sellinger, with unexampled wisdom, was careful to keep off the subject, and
  when Tearle's name came into the conversation it was Dr. Shaw who was
  responsible.</p>

  <p>"There was rather an unpleasant little incident this morning in town," he
  said&mdash;and when those of Rindle School referred to "town," they meant all
  that part of Rindle which was not school. "I don't know what started it, but
  I'm quite sure the boy was not in the wrong."</p>

  <p>"Is one of the boys in trouble, Father?" asked Vera quickly.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly in trouble. You remember&mdash;do you know the man
  Crickley&mdash;he has a tumbledown shanty on the Jamaica Road?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"An awful ruffian," she said; "he was at court last year, and he drinks,
  doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I should imagine he had been drinking this morning. He was going through
  the town with his unfortunate wife, and apparently something she said
  disagreed with him&mdash;at any rate, the brute hit her first with his stick,
  and although I don't suppose he hurt her very much, one of the boys of the
  fifth&mdash;young Tilling, to be exact&mdash;who happened to be passing,
  interfered...."</p>

  <p>"Good for him!" said the girl, her eyes sparkling.</p>

  <p>Dr. Shaw smiled.</p>

  <p>"It looked like being bad for him," he said. "For the blackguard turned
  his attention to the boy, and had him by the scruff of his neck, according to
  accounts, when Tearle, who was going over to the higher mathematical set,
  came upon the scene. I understand he asked the man very civilly to release
  the boy; whereupon he certainly loosed his hold of the boy, but he struck at
  Tearle."</p>

  <p>The girl opened her mouth in consternation.</p>

  <p>"Was he&mdash;was he hurt?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he was," the doctor chuckled quietly. "Tearle, you
  know"&mdash;he turned to Sellinger&mdash;"is our games master, and a rattling
  good instructor in boxing. I saw the captain of the school, who witnessed the
  encounter, and he is most enthusiastic about what followed."</p>

  <p>"Did he strike the man? Was there a brawl?" asked Sellinger, ready to be
  shocked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there was much of a brawl, but he certainly struck the
  man," said the doctor dryly. "Crickley had to be assisted away."</p>

  <p>Sellinger shook his head heavily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether that sort of thing's good for Rindle," he said, in
  his capacity of patron saint.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said the doctor sharply, and the girl beamed upon her father.
  "A most excellent lesson and example to the boys. It means, of course, that
  the boys in Tearle's form will give themselves airs, but it is what I would
  term a most excellent thing to have happened."</p>

  <p>Sellinger was discreetly silent on this conclusion.</p>

  <p>"I talked to Tearle after school," he said. "Of course, Tearle was most
  apologetic." He paused and frowned. "Do you know, Vera," he said, "I had the
  most extraordinary impression when I was speaking to Tearle. In this
  morning's paper&mdash;which, of course, you haven't read, my dear, at least
  not the part that I am referring to&mdash;there was a reference to a
  challenge which had been issued by a certain Unknown to the boxer, Snub
  Reilly."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that&mdash;" she said breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had that impression&mdash;that Tearle was the Unknown. You see, I
  mentioned the fight of the previous evening, and I talked to him about the
  challenge, just as I might talk to Sellinger here, in an ordinary
  matter-of-fact way. And do you know that he went as red as a beetroot?"</p>

  <p>Sellinger laughed loud and heartily.</p>

  <p>"That would be too absurd," he said contemptuously. "I grant that our
  friend Tearle may be a most excellent boxer, but an excellent amateur has no
  earthly chance against even a third-class professional; and Snub Reilly is at
  the top of his class."</p>

  <p>Dr. Shaw shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I agree it is ridiculous," he said.</p>

  <p>"Besides," Sellinger went on, enlarging his argument, "before that match
  can occur, somebody has got to find ten thousand pounds; and ten thousand
  pounds is a lot of money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vera was looking at him, and their eyes met. She saw in his the dawn of a
  great suspicion, and her hand gripped the handle of her bread-knife
  murderously. It was Sellinger who changed the subject abruptly, but the girl
  knew that he was far from relinquishing his theory.</p>

  <p>Sellinger went out to telephone to his house, and the girl was left alone
  with her father.</p>

  <p>"Daddie," she said, "do you like Mr. Sellinger?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her over his glasses.</p>

  <p>"No, dear; to be candid," he said slowly, "I think him a most unmitigated
  bore."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand solemnly and her father gripped it.</p>

  <p>"I think you are the most wonderful father in the world," she said. "And
  all this time I was thinking that you loved him."</p>

  <p>"I loathe him," said her father frankly, "in so far as it is possible for
  a person of my profession to loathe anybody. But the Sellingers are a sort of
  tradition at Rindle, and one has to be civil to them."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you something."</p>

  <p>She walked over and shut the door which Sellinger had left open.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what he suggested to me this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Who, Sellinger?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He suggested that the School Extension funds are being stolen by Mr.
  Tearle."</p>

  <p>Dr. Shaw jumped up, pink with anger.</p>

  <p>"How dare he? It's a monstrous suggestion!" he said. "I shall tell
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you'll tell him nothing," said Vera hastily. "What is the use of my
  giving you my confidence? I am only telling you for your guidance."</p>

  <p>Mr. Shaw sat down in his chair again.</p>

  <p>"A disgraceful suggestion," he rumbled, "and palpably stupid. Certainly,
  Tearle as treasurer has control of the money."</p>

  <p>"Is it cash? I mean, could you go into a room and take so many hundreds or
  thousands from a box?" asked the girl, and Dr. Shaw laughed.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. The money is represented by certain
  securities&mdash;stocks in various industries and railways. Tearle has the
  handling and the care of these stocks&mdash;he is a capital man of business.
  But to suggest&mdash;!" he fumed, and it needed all the girl's power of
  persuasion to bring him back to a condition of calm.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sellinger went home that night deep in thought, and sat up until two
  o'clock in the morning writing letters to his friends. One of these friends
  was an editor of a newspaper closely identified with sport, and from him in a
  few days he learned more particulars of the challenge which had been issued
  to the great Snub Reilly. The fifty thousand dollars had to be deposited by
  the fifth of the following month, the sum being lodged in the bank in the
  name of three prominent sportsmen, one of whom was the writer. Where would
  Tearle get his fifty thousand? He was absolutely certain that Tearle was the
  challenger, and the news he had from the school confirmed him in his opinion.
  Further confirmation came one day at a committee meeting when Tearle had
  taken some papers from his pocket. Amongst them Sellinger saw a somewhat
  gaudy print. It was strangely familiar to him, but it was not until he got
  home that it flashed upon him that the print was a program of the Reilly-Boyd
  fight! So Tearle had been a spectator after all! And he had sworn that he had
  not seen the fight! The master, too, was in strict training, and once,
  looking from his bedroom in the dark hours of the morning&mdash;Sellinger was
  not a good sleeper&mdash;he saw a figure in white vest and shorts run past
  the lodge entrance, and recognized Barry Tearle as the runner.</p>

  <p>The weeks that followed were for Mr. Sellinger weeks of interest and
  investigation. At a meeting of the Extension Committee, which gathered once a
  week to transact formal business, he asked for and secured a list of the
  securities held by the treasurer. And with this in his possession he bided
  his time.</p>

  <p>There arrived at this period an unobtrusive individual who took lodgings
  in the village and appeared to have very little to do except to loaf about
  the school and watch the boys and the masters go in and out. He was a
  charming man, who made friends with the postmaster, and was on good terms
  with all the tradesmen before he had been in the village three days. One
  night Sellinger was finishing his dinner when a visitor was announced. It was
  the stranger, who greeted his employer deferentially.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Sellinger," he said, with satisfaction, "I have a few items of
  information for you which will interest you."</p>

  <p>"Have you got him?" asked Mr. Sellinger eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't like to say that," said the detective, "but I rather fancy
  that if we haven't got him, we've put him in a very tight corner."</p>

  <p>He took a notebook from his pocket, and turned the leaves.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday afternoon Tearle sent a registered envelope to Taylor and
  Grime, the brokers. I got the address, because I'm a friend of the
  postmaster's&mdash;anyway, that was easy. I went straight up to the city by
  the night train, and called at Taylor and Grime the next morning, and it
  couldn't have happened better for me, because there's a clerk in the office
  who I know very well. As a matter of fact, I saved him from a whole lot of
  trouble a couple of years ago."</p>

  <p>"What was it that Tearle sent?" asked Sellinger, holding his breath.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand shares in the Rochester and Holbeach Railroad, one thousand
  shares in the Land Development Syndicate, and a thousand shares in the
  Newport Dock Corporation."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said Sellinger hastily, and went to his desk. He came
  back with a list.</p>

  <p>"Read the names of those stocks over again," he said, and the detective
  complied.</p>

  <p>"That's it!" Sellinger nodded. "All these shares are held by Tearle on
  behalf of the School Extension Fund!"</p>

  <p>The detective looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do&mdash;pinch him?" he asked, and Mr.
  Sellinger smiled.</p>

  <p>"No," he said softly, "I don't think we need arrest him yet awhile."</p>

  <p>He paced up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," he said. "I'm having the masters up to
  dinner tomorrow night. It's a practice that the Sellingers have always
  followed since the foundation of the school&mdash;I suppose you know that
  Rindle School was founded by one of my ancestors."</p>

  <p>The detective did not know, but bowed reverently.</p>

  <p>"Tearle lives with old Mrs. Gold in the High Street," Sellinger went on.
  "She's as deaf as a brick, and I believe goes to bed every night at nine o
  'clock. His rooms are a long way from where she and the servants sleep, and
  anyway she's so deaf that she wouldn't hear you."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" asked the detective</p>

  <p>"Whilst I have Mr. Tearle here"&mdash;Sellinger emphasized his words with
  a regular thrust of his finger into his hireling's waistcoat&mdash;"you will
  make a very careful search through Tearle's papers."</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"I get you," he said. "But how am I to find my way into the house?"</p>

  <p>"The front door is always unfastened when Tearle is out at night," said
  Sellinger. "He was telling the Head last week that he never carried a key,
  and most of the houses leave their doors open&mdash;there is no crime in
  Rindle.</p>

  <p>"Except what we commit," said the detective humorously.</p>

  <p>"That," said Mr. Sellinger gravely, "is an impertinence. This is not a
  crime: I am acting in the best interests of justice."</p>

  <p>The Sellinger dinner, which, as Mr. Sellinger said, was a feature of
  Rindle School life, was a deadly dull affair to two of the guests. For the
  host, with commendable foresight, had so arranged the seats that Vera Shaw
  sat at one end of the board on his right, and Barry Tearle at the other end
  of the long table on Dr. Shaw's right. This arrangement suited Mr. Sellinger
  admirably, because he had a proposal to make to Vera, the terms of which had
  taken a good day's thought. The girl, who would never have attended but for
  the fact that the three mistresses which Rindle boasted were present, was
  openly bored&mdash;a fact which Mr. Sellinger did not observe.</p>

  <p>They were half-way through dinner when Sellinger exposed his grand
  scheme.</p>

  <p>"Miss Vera," he said (he had compromised to that extent), "I want to make
  a suggestion to you, and I wonder how you'll take it?"</p>

  <p>"That depends upon the suggestion," she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"It may shock you," he began cautiously, lowering his voice.
  "But&mdash;how would you like to see the fight?"</p>

  <p>"See the fight?" she repeated, startled. "Do you mean the fight
  between&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Between Snub Reilly and the Great Unknown," he said jocularly.</p>

  <p>She thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"I hardly think I'd like to see it at all," she said. "I do not approve of
  women attending such exhibitions."</p>

  <p>"Suppose the Great Unknown were a friend of yours?" he said deliberately,
  and her face went pink.</p>

  <p>"How absurd! Do you suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I not only suggest, but I know," he said. "You must promise not to tell
  Tearle, because, if my surmise is correct, he would be upset by your knowing,
  and maybe the thing would peter out."</p>

  <p>"But it's nonsense," she said contemptuously. "How could Mr. Tearle find
  ten thousand&mdash;" She bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"He may have friends," said Sellinger suavely.</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he could win&mdash;supposing he
  were&mdash;the&mdash;Unknown?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" lied Sellinger. "I'm told he is a very brilliant boxer, and I'm
  not so sure that Snub Reilly couldn't be beaten."</p>

  <p>He saw the girl's head turn slowly, and, as if obeying a common impulse,
  Barry Tearle raised his head at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want me to go?" she asked suddenly. But he was prepared for
  that: it was in framing the answer to such a question that he had spent the
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said stoutly, "I think he will win. And, what is
  more"&mdash;it cost him a greater effort to deliver this sentiment than to
  carry out the rest of the scheme&mdash;"because I've an idea that Tearle is
  fond of you."</p>

  <p>She turned quickly away, and did not reply for some minutes.</p>

  <p>"I'll go on one condition," she said, "and I think that it can be managed.
  I have to go to town, and my aunt has asked me to stay the night&mdash;I can
  easily pretend that I am going to a theatre. Who will take me?"</p>

  <p>"I, of course," said Mr. Sellinger gallantly, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"What is the condition?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That if you find you are wrong, and the&mdash;the Unknown is not
  Mr.&mdash;Tearle&mdash;you will take me away."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mr. Sellinger heartily. "I wouldn't dream of allowing
  you to see the fight unless our friend was involved. Now remember, Miss Vera,
  it is absolutely necessary that you should not mention this matter to Mr.
  Tearle. Let it be a surprise to him. I can imagine," he went on, "how
  delighted he would be, how nerved for the&mdash;er&mdash;combat."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk about it any more," she said.</p>

  <p>To Barry Tearle's intense disappointment she left with her father, and
  scarcely spoke two words to him. He was puzzled. What had she and Sellinger
  been talking about so earnestly? he wondered. Did they know&mdash;he went
  pale at the thought.</p>

  <p>He walked back to his lodgings a greatly worried young man.</p>

  <p>The last guest had hardly departed before the detective was ushered into
  Sellinger's library, and one glance at his face revealed to that gentleman
  the measure of his success.</p>

  <p>"We've got him, sir," he said exultantly. "Here you are." He laid a sheet
  of paper before the other.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>"I've copied them from a letter which I found on his table."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sellinger picked up the paper and fixed his glasses. It was from a
  city bank and acknowledged the receipt of fifty thousand dollars which had
  been paid into Barry Tearle's account. But it was the second extract which
  filled Mr. Sellinger with joy. It was merely three lines copied from the
  counterfoil of Barry Tearle's check-book, which showed that the sum of fifty
  thousand dollars had been made out in favor of the Fight Committee!</p>

  <p>Mr. Sellinger rubbed his hands.</p>

  <p>"You've done splendidly, my friend, splendidly," he said. "Now, what shall
  we do?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to have him arrested at once," said the detective, shaking his
  head. "Unless you take immediate steps, you'll never recover that money."</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Sellinger.</p>

  <p>He knew something better than that, but this he did not explain to the
  detective. He was going to see Tearle beaten&mdash;and somebody else was
  going to see him beaten too. And when the fight was over, the comedy would
  develop into drama and melodrama at that.</p>

  <p>"I want somebody to have a lesson," he said solemnly, "a lesson which they
  will never forget in their lives, and which may have a lasting beneficial
  effect upon their future. To the uninitiated, my act may seem a cruel one;
  but it is often necessary, my friend, that one should be cruel to be
  kind."</p>

  <p>"But what about the money?" asked the puzzled but practical detective.
  "That is going to be lost."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Mr. Sellinger. "If it is, then I am happily in a
  position to make good to the school the amount that this man has stolen."</p>

  <p>He might have kept his secret, he might have maintained his outward calm
  to the grand dénouement; but it was impossible that he could keep his
  knowledge pent so long. The girl left for town early on the morning of the
  fight, and Barry, when he learned she had gone, and had gone without seeing
  him, felt as though the motor of life had dropped out. He himself went up by
  the afternoon train, having secured permission from the Head. An hour before
  he left, Dr. Shaw sent for him, and the doctor was obviously ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"You wanted me, sir?" said Barry, coming into the study, and the Head
  looked round with a start.</p>

  <p>"Yes, er&mdash;yes, Tearle," said the doctor uncomfortably. "Sit down,
  will you? I wanted to say to you&mdash;that I wish you luck."</p>

  <p>He put out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm a little worried, you know, Tearle, about it all, and to me it seems
  that you haven't a ghost of a chance."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, I believe you are the Unknown who has challenged this boxer, and
  somehow I wish you hadn't. It is not that I disapprove of boxing, and
  although there is certain to be a little trouble if the truth comes out that
  you are the challenger, we can get over that. No, it's the fear that you have
  risked your own private fortune"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"unless, of course,
  you persuaded your friends to assist you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it is all my own money," said Barry Tearle steadily.</p>

  <p>"I hope you win." Dr. Shaw shook him cheerfully by the hand. "You're a
  good fellow, Tearle, and&mdash;and I hope you win; and I'm sure if
  my&mdash;if my girl knew, and of course she doesn't dream that you are taking
  part in this contest, that she would echo my wishes."</p>

  <p>Barry wrung his hand in silence and left with a little lump in his
  throat.</p>

  <p>It was a grand adventure for the girl. All day she had thought about
  nothing else, and alternated between hope and dread. Sometimes it was dread
  of the spectacle she would see; sometimes&mdash;and more often&mdash;it was
  the picture of Barry Tearle's failure which made her shiver. The faithful Mr.
  Sellinger arrived at nine o'clock in the evening. He was in his most jovial
  mood, as he had reason to be, for he had just parted from two Central Office
  detectives after putting them in possession of the vital facts.</p>

  <p>He had arranged that the girl should arrive at the theatre where the fight
  was taking place, in time to miss some of the minor encounters which preceded
  it, and it was while they were waiting in the vestibule for one such contest
  to finish that he was hailed by a friend, and left her for a moment.</p>

  <p>Vera was feeling self-conscious and uncomfortable. It did not bring ease
  to her mind that there were other ladies present. She felt ashamed and
  furtive and mean, and for the first time she began to have serious doubts as
  to what effect her presence would have upon the man whose victory she
  desired.</p>

  <p>She still told herself that Sellinger was mistaken, and that the
  challenger was some other person than Barry, but in her heart of hearts she
  knew that she would see the man she loved within that cruel ring; and the
  thought of it set her heart thumping wildly.</p>

  <p>"Talk to me later, Johnson. I'm going to get my seat," she heard Sellinger
  say, and then he took her arm and led her down a long aisle.</p>

  <p>The theatre was in darkness save for the brilliant lights which hung above
  a square, white platform.</p>

  <p>So that was the ring! It was smaller than she had expected. She looked
  round at the spectators in the gloom, and thought she had never seen so many
  thousands of faces so close together. She was seized with a panic as to what
  all those thousands would say if Barry was defeated. Would they cheer? She
  stopped, gripping fast to Sellinger's arm. She couldn't bear that.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'll go in," she whispered. "I really don't think that I
  can stand it."</p>

  <p>"Come along," said Sellinger soothingly, and led her down to a ring
  seat.</p>

  <p>She was too near. She knew that she was too near. She would rather see
  this thing at such a distance as made it impossible to distinguish between
  one fighter and the other. But she was there now and she must stay. And then
  it was that Sellinger could keep his secret no longer.</p>

  <p>There was some delay, they learned. Snub had not arrived, but had
  telephoned that he was on the way. But for the delay, and the opportunity
  which it gave him, Sellinger might have maintained his silence to the end.
  But now he bent over the girl, and step by step traced the progress of his
  investigations, and she listened, chilled with horror. She could not even
  find the words to protest.</p>

  <p>He might have noticed her distress, and in pity have toned down his lurid
  recital; but he was hot with triumph, and found a joy in his brutality. And
  then the climax came, when the girl was clutching to the arm of her chair,
  half fainting. The man to whom Sellinger had spoken in the vestibule came up,
  and said Snub had arrived. Mr. Johnson was stout, red faced, and white
  haired.</p>

  <p>"Is the Unknown here?" demanded Sellinger with a grim smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, he's here. I'm told he's going to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's going nowhere," almost shouted Sellinger. "I've got a couple of
  detectives waiting for him, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't, don't!" said Vera, white to her lips.</p>

  <p>"A couple of detectives?" The man looked from one to the other. "Well, I
  think that's rotten of you, Sellinger. The man has had his punishment. Why
  should he have more?"</p>

  <p>"You know him, then?"</p>

  <p>"I know him very well indeed," said Sellinger. "I don't know about his
  punishment."</p>

  <p>"He had two years' imprisonment for forgery in Australia. He was one of
  the best lightweights we've had in this country for years. I told them that
  they ought to have come out boldly and told the public that it is Kid Mackay
  who was challenging; but the men who are behind him insisted on introducing
  him as 'An Unknown,' an idiotic piece of tactics."</p>

  <p>The color was coming back to the girl's face as her eyes were fixed upon
  the other.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Kid Mackay, madam," said Sellinger's friend, and went on: "One of the
  best lads in the ring three years ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then it's not Tearle?" wailed Sellinger.</p>

  <p>Such a look of bewilderment was on his face that she could have laughed.
  Then with a start she remembered.</p>

  <p>"You must take me away. You promised that if it was not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her words were interrupted by a roar. A man was coming down one of the
  aisles in a purple dressing-gown. As he swung up between the ropes, his
  broad, good-humored face all smiles, one half the audience recognized the
  Unknown as the erstwhile champion and understood the reticence that his
  backers had shown.</p>

  <p>But now a greater roar shook the building. Another figure moved amidst his
  seconds, and leaping lightly up to the ring, dodged through the ropes. From
  every part of the vast hall came a shout:</p>

  <p>"Snub&mdash;Snub Reilly!"</p>

  <p>"Snub Reilly!" Mr. Sellinger's voice was hollow, and then Snub Reilly
  turned, and the girl half rose from her seat.</p>

  <p>For the man who stared down at her with wonder in his open eyes was Barry
  Tearle!</p>

  <p>Mr. Sellinger sat, stricken dumb, his mouth agape. As for the girl, she
  looked on as if in a trance. She saw the preliminaries, watched the opening
  of the first round, her eyes never leaving the lithe figure that leaped and
  lunged. She could hear the thud of gloves as they struck, but whose gloves
  they were and who was being struck she could not tell. It was at the
  beginning of the second round that "the Unknown" forced the fighting, in
  spite of the injunctions and prayers of his seconds to remain strictly on the
  defensive for the first eight rounds. Right and left flashed Snub's terrible
  fists. The Unknown staggered. A second blow to the jaw landed, timed to the
  fraction of a second....</p>

  <p>The fight was over. It was over, too, for Vera Shaw, and Barry Tearle
  leaped the ropes in time to catch her as she fainted....</p>

  <p>It was in the Head's study the next morning that Barry Tearle, unmarked by
  his exertions the night before, told his story.</p>

  <p>"My father was a boxer," he said. "He used to travel the country fairs,
  and every penny he made he put into my education. He did something
  more&mdash;he taught me the game as no man knew it better than he. He died
  whilst I was at the University, and it looked as though my education was
  going to stop short. I loved my studies, and I loved the life I had planned
  for myself. But I wanted money. I had no friends or influence. One morning at
  breakfast I saw in the sporting press a challenge issued on behalf of a man
  whom I had seen fight, and whom I thought I could beat. I pawned everything I
  had to cover his modest stake, and, adopting the name of Snub
  Reilly&mdash;Reilly is my second name, by the way&mdash;I fought him and won.
  I have fought during every vacation for three years, and"&mdash;he looked
  down at the girl&mdash;"I have fought my last fight."</p>

  <p>The doctor cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Vera has told me something of Mr. Sellinger's accusation. You sold some
  bonds?"</p>

  <p>Barry nodded.</p>

  <p>"They were my own bonds," he said. "I had to raise ten thousand pounds to
  cover this challenge. They were bonds similar to those which you held for the
  Extension Fund."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Dr. Shaw nodded, "you would buy the best stock, both for the
  school and for yourself."</p>

  <p>He was looking down at his blotting-pad thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You have fought your last fight?" he said.</p>

  <p>Barry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. From now on, Snub Reilly disappears. I have made a considerable
  sum, quite sufficient for my needs."</p>

  <p>"Nobody at the school knows you are&mdash;Snub Reilly?"</p>

  <p>"Except Mr. Sellinger," said Vera.</p>

  <p>"I do not think Mr. Sellinger will be anxious to talk about the part he
  has played in a business which is only discreditable in so far as he has been
  concerned," said Dr. Shaw.</p>

  <p>For the second time in twenty-four hours he put out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I rather think," he said, "I should like to have seen that fight.
  Wouldn't you, Vera?"</p>

  <p>The girl shuddered and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Of course not, of course not. How could I ask such a thing?" said the
  doctor tenderly, and he dropped his hand on her shoulder. "You couldn't
  imagine my little girl in that sort of atmosphere, could you, Tearle?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Barry Tearle shook his head. He and Vera went out together into the
  old-world quadrangle, and neither spoke.</p>

  <p>"I must go into the house now, Barry," she said. "You&mdash;you weren't
  very much hurt last night?" she added anxiously. "Oh, my dear, I was so happy
  when you won." She laid her hands impulsively on his breast. "And I've quite
  forgiven your little lie!"</p>

  <p>"My little lie!" He was astonished.</p>

  <p>"You said you had not seen the fight that night."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see it," he insisted. "I felt it&mdash;but I didn't see it."</p>

  <p>Since the classrooms overlook the quadrangle, what followed would have
  been witnessed by the whole of the fifth classical form but for the tact of
  the head prefect of School House who happened to be standing by the window,
  and closed it with a bang.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story03"
     id="story03">3. A ROMANCE IN BROWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Romance...? Yes, of a kind. Romance brings up the nine-
  fifteen... and there is romance in... well, courtship and that sort of thing.
  But life is fairly humdrum and unexciting. Wars... at a distance are
  immensely stirring, but close at hand, look rather like a street accident
  multiplied by millions. Life is utterly devoid of sensation, and romance is
  really sensation of a pleasant kind."</p>

  <p>James Calcott Berkley sniffed.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have your mind for money," he said, and his senior partner
  chuckled softly to himself.</p>

  <p>He was a stout man and comfortable. You could not imagine him without a
  stiff collar and a heavy watch-guard. Jim often wondered what he looked like
  in pyjamas&mdash;the chances were that he wore a nightshirt anyway&mdash;a
  silk nightshirt with broad magenta stripes.</p>

  <p>"Money doesn't buy experience," said Mr. Calley. "Years, disappointments,
  knowing successions of exquisitely featured chorus girls and small-part
  ladies, who look like Athens at its palmiest, and talk like the Old Kent
  Road; it's being looked at with pure limpid eyes, so big and innocent that
  you get a lump in your throat, and watching them, change to granite when they
  price the little present you've given to their owner."</p>

  <p>This time Jim Berkley sighed.</p>

  <p>"What a perfectly horrible past you must have, Calley!" he said.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," protested the stout Mr. Calley, "my life has been
  singularly free from complications. There is a gray which has a purplish
  tinge&mdash;that is the color which most nearly represents the past of Cæsar
  Calley. We look at the matter from the standpoint of fifty and twenty-seven.
  You ought to be married," he went on, and Jim closed his eyes wearily. "That
  statement may make you dither, but it is a fact. Marriage destroys the icing,
  but reveals the cake, and you can't live on almond icing any more than you
  can make a square meal of Turkish Delight. You're well off, you're nice
  looking, you have decent standards of conduct ... in fact, you're a desirable
  match."</p>

  <p>"I have never actually met anybody..." said Jim. "There are thousands of
  girls, of course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But they lack the atmosphere of romance," interrupted the other dryly;
  "they eat food and they ride to hounds, and they are entirely without
  mystery. You'll never get married if you wait for mystery. There is nothing
  mysterious about women&mdash;they are just men with a different code of
  honour. They never pay their card debts, but they won't take tea in your
  rooms unless they bring their aunts."</p>

  <p>"Br-r!" shivered Jim. "Marriage! The wedding reception... the awful church
  and the best man and the tight boots and the confetti!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Calley put on his gold-rimmed glasses and surveyed his partner
  dispassionately.</p>

  <p>"Even Prince Charming had to go through something of the sort when he wed
  the Fairy Princess," he said, "and I guess the fairy princess sat up half the
  night worrying whether the bridesmaids ought to wear gray charmeuse or white
  tulle. There is nothing wholly romantic and nothing wholly sordid. You can't
  have silk without worms."</p>

  <p>Jim Berkley made a hasty exit. Marriage was a subject which irritated and
  annoyed him. And when Galley said that no woman had mystery ...!</p>

  <p>His watch said twenty minutes past three o'clock, and he stood at the
  window looking down into Gresham Street. He was so standing, absorbed in his
  thoughts, when Calley put his head in at the door.</p>

  <p>"Hullo? Looking for the Brown Girl?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No!" said Jim loudly.</p>

  <p>"Thought you might be; queer bird&mdash;I'm off. Shan't be up
  tomorrow&mdash;I'm playing in a foursome at Mid-Surrey."</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Jim absently.</p>

  <p>"As to romance," insisted Calley, "have you ever considered Boccaccio's
  stories in cold blood? Why, there isn't a Sunday newspaper that doesn't beat
  the story of Violante and Theodoro&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up!" snarled Jim, and his amiable partner closed the door
  grinning.</p>

  <p>The bells of St. Olives tolled the half-hour, and then James Calcott
  Berkley reaped the regard of his vigil. The Brown Girl was walking slowly
  along the pavement on the opposite side of the road&mdash;as she walked every
  day when the bells of St. Olives rang the half-hour.</p>

  <p>He took up the pair of field-glasses that were on his desk, and standing
  back from the window, focused them. She was exquisitely beautiful&mdash;he
  had never seen such loveliness in his life. Invariably she was dressed in
  brown; but seldom did she wear the same costume twice. Who was she? By the
  regularity of her appearance, he was certain that she was employed somewhere
  in the neighborhood. Yet, she was too well dressed to be an ordinary
  employee, too young to hold any responsible post. And then, most
  unaccountable phenomenon of all, there was the little old woman who was
  always waiting for her, and to whom she invariably handed a letter with a
  little smile.</p>

  <p>Every day this happened, the little old woman in the plaid shawl hobbled
  across the street and took the letter; there was a brief exchange of words
  and the little old woman crossed the street again, and the girl passed on out
  of sight. That happened today.</p>

  <p>It was Calley who had first seen her, and in his prosaic unimaginative way
  had christened her "the Brown Girl." And yet it was a name which Jim liked.
  "Queer bird!" He shuddered at the grossness of the description. Presently she
  was out of sight, and he turned with a sigh and a sense of bitter resentment
  to a review of the day's transactions, for Jim was a stockbroker, as his
  father had been before him.</p>

  <p>The arrival of his secretary with letters to sign gave him an idea.</p>

  <p>"Thompson, I've often wondered how... well, poor people, without
  opportunities for meeting socially... get acquainted."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir? Well, they sort of meet," said Thompson vaguely. "You mean
  young men and young ladies?"</p>

  <p>Jim, very hot, nodded, not daring to meet the eyes of his clerk, lest his
  secret be read.</p>

  <p>"Generally the girl's got a brother who asks a boy to the house, or they
  meet at a dance. There are thousands of ways."</p>

  <p>Jim coughed as he scribbled his name.</p>

  <p>"Yes... but suppose he doesn't know the brother&mdash;if there is a
  brother. Just sees her on the street, and... well... falls in love with her
  and all that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>Thompson was young, but experienced.</p>

  <p>"That's a bit difficult," he said, "because no lady likes to be picked up,
  in a manner of speaking. He just finds out who she is, and gets somebody to
  introduce him."</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"But, suppose he doesn't know who she is... suppose he just sees her and
  doesn't know from Adam or Eve what her name is?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Thompson considered this weighty problem.</p>

  <p>"There are several stunts he can work, such as picking up a handkerchief
  and saying 'Excuse me, miss, is this yours?' or he can follow her home and
  make inquiries, or he can pretend that he's met her before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"None of which methods appeal to me, Thompson," said Jim sharply, and went
  a fiery red under Thompson's suspicious scrutiny.</p>

  <p>He went back to his flat in Portland Place, his mind wholly occupied by
  the Brown Girl, her mystery, her glorious beauty. That night he dreamed of
  her; she and he were sitting on the yellow sands, and before them stretched
  the unbroken horizon of a sunlit sea. He was holding her hand, sublimely,
  supremely happy, and she was looking at him shyly and saying, "Harold, do you
  think you really will be happy?"</p>

  <p>When he awoke, and recalling the dream realized that his name was not
  "Harold," he was aggrieved until he remembered that dreams go contrariwise,
  and that no unknown Harold would ever hold her hand.</p>

  <p>Calley was away next morning and he was glad, because he had determined to
  follow Thompson's advice&mdash;with modifications. He must discover who she
  was. The uncertainty was worrying him&mdash;spoiling his days and disturbing
  his nights.</p>

  <p>At three-thirty, when the clock of St. Olives struck, he was waiting in
  the doorway of his office. He saw the little old woman come into Gresham
  Street from the Moorgate Street end, and take up her station.</p>

  <p>And then he saw the Brown Girl. Nearer at hand, she was more radiantly
  lovely than ever. Looking neither to left nor to right, she came slowly on,
  and the little woman in the plaid shawl crossed the street to meet her. There
  was a brief colloquy, the invariable flash of the Brown Girl's smile, and
  then the little old woman recrossed the road, clutching tightly at the white
  envelope. The Brown Girl resumed her walk, and Jim, with a flutter at his
  heart, followed her boldly.</p>

  <p>She turned into Moorgate Street, with Jim a dozen paces behind her. Her
  costume <i>was</i> expensive, her feet were daintily shod, her stockings of
  silk&mdash;he knew this much of woman's mystery.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, to his surprise she stopped by the side of a limousine that was
  drawn up by the side of the street, opened the door and stepped in. He could
  only stand still, paralyzed with astonishment. The car was on the move, when
  the door opened and the girl stepped out. The reason for this reckless action
  was not at first apparent, for Jim did not see the bag she had dropped until
  after he had sprung forward and lifted her from where she lay.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing. I'm sorry to have troubled you... I tapped on the window,
  but Bennett did not hear me.... I was so alarmed about losing my bag...."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she limped as she walked to where the bag lay. Jim snatched
  it up for her.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you aren't hurt?" he asked, and in his agitation his voice
  sounded as though it belonged to somebody else.</p>

  <p>"No... really... it was stupid of me."</p>

  <p>"Can't I take you somewhere... to a doctor's?" he asked, as he helped her
  into the car. The crowd that every such occurrence attracts had gathered.</p>

  <p>"No... yes, please come in with me," she said hurriedly, and when he
  followed her and the machine moved on: "I'm really not hurt, but I didn't
  wish to argue with you before all those people. I really am quite
  well&mdash;you won't mind if I drop you at Liverpool Street? I am awfully
  grateful to you."</p>

  <p>She also was a little incoherent.</p>

  <p>Jim sat by her side, bolt upright, hardly daring to breathe. He was dazed
  and bewildered, and had not recovered when, in response to her signal, the
  car pulled up.</p>

  <p>"I feel I'm being very rude in turning you out," she said, and her smile
  was adorable, "but... I don't want mother to know that I have been in the
  city."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said Jim. It seemed the most natural thing in the world
  that she should not wish her mother to know that she had been in the
  city.</p>

  <p>He took her hand and dropped it instantly. She seemed amused. Watching the
  car as it plunged into the traffic he saw her looking back through the glass
  panel in the hood, and waved his hand. He was astounded at his boldness.</p>

  <p>That night he thought of her. He found time to have dinner and read the
  evening newspapers, but these were the briefest interruptions to his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>Calley was boisterously cheerful next morning. He and his partner had
  unexpectedly beaten the club champions.</p>

  <p>"My putting was a little short of marvelous," he said immodestly. "I'll
  show you one shot I did&mdash;Ferguson, the pro., said he'd never seen
  anything approaching it. Now, suppose this paper-weight is the ball...."</p>

  <p>"And, by the way, Jim," he said, when he had finished his demonstration,
  "I want to be away all next Thursday. I'll look in in the morning, but I want
  to go almost immediately. I'm playing Jack Anderson, and we've got a side bet
  of a tenner. Will you remember that? Somebody must be at the office to deal
  with Balter's account&mdash;he's buying now, and he's a tetchy devil."</p>

  <p>"I'll be here," said Jim, "though it is deplorable that a man of your age
  and substance should spend his days chasing an inoffensive ball."</p>

  <p>"You don't know what golf is to an intellectual man," said Calley.</p>

  <p>He went away after lunch and Jim was thankful. Ordinarily, golf talk
  mildly interested. Today it was torture.</p>

  <p>At three-thirty the Brown Girl came into Gresham Street. He was watching
  her from the shadow of the doorway, and, waiting until the little drama had
  been played out and the woman in the plaid shawl had left her, he quickened
  his pace and overtook her as she turned the corner of the street.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me the unpardonable liberty," he stammered, hat in hand, "but I
  was worried... I wondered, I mean, if your ankle was better?"</p>

  <p>For a second she looked at him distrustfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is quite well. It is kind of you to ask."</p>

  <p>Here he was at a loss to find an excuse to continue the conversation, but
  he was desperate.</p>

  <p>"There is something I should like to say to you, Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw alarm in her eyes and cursed himself for being the cause.</p>

  <p>"Jones&mdash;Ella Jones. My name isn't Jones, really, but I can't tell
  you..." she said. "I'm afraid I can't wait... I have an appointment ... you
  aren't Signor Vallassini, are you?"</p>

  <p>The question took him aback.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I'm not. I'm&mdash;not Signor... I didn't catch the
  name?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter&mdash;besides, I ought to have known that you weren't
  Italian. Oh!"</p>

  <p>She was frightened now, looking at him with wide-opened eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're... a detective!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He hadn't the presence of mind, nor yet the power of speech, to deny the
  charge.</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me, please?" she asked hurriedly, and he accompanied
  her in silence to the waiting car. She gave some instructions to the driver
  and then stepped in. Jim followed, his heart beating wildly.</p>

  <p>A detective! What had she to fear and who was Signor Whatever-his-name
  was? Into what tangle of trouble had this beautiful girl strayed?</p>

  <p>"I won't ask you who you are, but I have a feeling that you have been
  watching me."</p>

  <p>She waited for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he hesitated. "I have been...."</p>

  <p>"For long?"</p>

  <p>He nodded miserably.</p>

  <p>"And you have seen me give the envelope to the agent?"</p>

  <p>"To the old lady," he said, and she bit her lower lip.</p>

  <p>"I meant 'old lady,'" she said. "You think it is strange, but I cannot
  explain. There are others involved&mdash;it is not my secret."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it isn't," said Jim. "My name, by the way, is Jim&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me!" she begged earnestly. "I don't think it would be fair to
  you. You are doing your duty and it is hateful of me even to suggest that you
  can be bought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a detective," said Jim. "Believe me, Miss Jones, I'm <i>not</i> a
  detective. I'm a very prosaic stockbroker, but if there is anything in the
  world I can do for you, I'd... I'd die to serve you!"</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking his sincerity. Startled as she was by his
  passionate declaration, she recognized the earnestness of the man by her
  side. She went red and white, and then:</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I can trust you?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Jim Berkley could only nod rapidly. He was incapable of speech.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you the whole story," she said, "but briefly it is this. My
  father, as a young man, lived in Italy and became, half in fun, half for the
  adventure of the thing, a member of a secret society. When he left Italy he
  thought the matter was ended, and indeed for many years the Milani&mdash;that
  was the name of the gang&mdash;left him alone. He became rich and married. A
  year ago he received a summons from the Milani, calling on him to
  assassinate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She mentioned a name revered in certain political circles, detested in
  others, and Jim gasped.</p>

  <p>"Alternatively he was to pay a certain sum of money every day. They
  refused to accept a lump sum, wishing to give him a daily reminder of his
  obligations to the gang. Every day I come to Gresham Street, where I am met
  by one of the emissaries of the Milani&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That old woman?" asked Jim incredulously.</p>

  <p>"That old woman," nodded the girl; "poor dear, I'm sure she doesn't
  realize the dreadful character of her errand, or the kind of people she is
  working for. The head of the movement is a villain named Vallassini&mdash;an
  Italian."</p>

  <p>"But why doesn't your father inform the police?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"He would be shot dead tomorrow," said the girl. "No, that isn't the way
  out. I have thought of a dozen."</p>

  <p>"If you can tell me in what way I can help," said the fervent Jim, "I'll
  do anything!"</p>

  <p>The car was passing through the streets of Bloomsbury. They might have
  been running along the top of the great wall of China for all that Jim
  noticed. He was conscious only of this vital and blessed fact. He was alone
  with the Brown Girl, her sleeve touched his, her little shoe was against his.
  He touched it furtively.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing you could do," she said, "but it would involve such
  risks that I hardly dare ask you. You have been a soldier?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;who hasn't?" said Jim, daring to smile for the first time. "And
  please do not worry about risks. There is nothing on earth I wouldn't
  face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure," she said hastily; "but this is no ordinary risk. I want to
  know where these people live. Especially the Italian."</p>

  <p>"Vaselini?" asked Jim. "I can remember his name by thinking of cold
  cream."</p>

  <p>"Vallassini," corrected the girl; "the woman goes to him every day. Follow
  her... yet I hate asking you. These people are desperate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jim drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"So am I," he said; "I'm desperately anxious to help you."</p>

  <p>She dropped him at the end of Portland Place. It was a coincidence that
  she chose this spot, and this time he held her hand a little longer.</p>

  <p>"You will see me tomorrow. After the old woman has left me, follow her. I
  will meet you... where?"</p>

  <p>Outside the Regent's Park Station he suggested, and to this she
  agreed.</p>

  <p>It required a little maneuvering to get away from the office next day.
  Calley was in one of his rare working moods.</p>

  <p>"Going home?" he said in surprise, and looked up at the clock. "Well,
  perhaps you're right.... I've a good mind to go myself. I'll walk with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble," said Jim in haste. "I'm&mdash;I'm meeting somebody quite
  close at hand."</p>

  <p>"Somebody romantic, I hope," said Calley, crudely sarcastic.</p>

  <p>Jim did not trouble to reply. Again he watched the meeting, but this time
  he followed the little old woman. He saw the girl pause at the corner of
  Moorgate Street and look back; he sensed approval and gratitude in that
  glance, and his heart swelled with pride.</p>

  <p>The woman in the plaid shawl made her slow way across Southwark Bridge. On
  the other side she boarded a car and Jim followed....</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock that night he met the girl at the appointed
  rendezvous.</p>

  <p>"Your old woman's name is Murphy. She has a fruit stall near the Exchange,
  and she lives at 47 Paton Street, Herne Hill&mdash;she has one room," he
  reported. "She has twice been in the hands of the police for violent assaults
  on other ladies of her calling, but of late years, owing to infirmity and her
  conversion to the temperance movement, she has lived a fairly uneventful
  life."</p>

  <p>"And Vallassini?"</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nobody knows him; the old woman has no visitors so far as I can
  discover."</p>

  <p>They were pacing together the deserted pavement of Park Crescent. It was
  very dark and once, when her foot slipped, she caught Jim's arm and did not
  let it go.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you something," said Jim huskily, after they had walked to
  and fro for a quarter of an hour, mainly in silence; "I want to ask you
  something."</p>

  <p>She inclined her head.</p>

  <p>"I love you," said Jim.</p>

  <p>He felt the arm in his shiver&mdash;but she did not take it away.</p>

  <p>"I love you dearly.... I have loved you ever since I first saw you. You
  are my dream girl... the mystery I have worshipped...."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please!" she whispered imploringly. "I can't...."</p>

  <p>"I want you to marry me. I am... well known... I mean I'm not... I mean I
  can give you a position."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jim!" she murmured, and he stooped and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"My father will be furious," she said in a muffled voice. He was holding
  her very tightly at the time. "But I do love you... and I don't know your
  name even, except Jim... and I hate the thought of marriage and all the fuss
  that people make."</p>

  <p>"I loathe it too, darling. I want to run away to some quiet registry
  office&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's just how I feel&mdash;but we'll have to tell father."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said Jim. "Of course we must tell him. Why not now?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer at once.</p>

  <p>"Mother will be horrified," she said, "and father will hate you. He has
  always wanted me to marry a rich man&mdash;are you rich?"</p>

  <p>Jim laughed and kissed her again. He needed very little excuse.</p>

  <p>"I'm not poor," he said. "Who was the man?"</p>

  <p>"An awful person. I've never met him, but he must be a terrible prig. He
  thinks women are commonplace, and he says he'll not marry until he meets the
  ideal woman. I hate being trotted out for inspection like a prize horse that
  has to impress the purchaser, so the only time he came to dinner I went to
  bed."</p>

  <p>"The brute!" said Jim. "Do I know him?"</p>

  <p>"You may do. He's well known in the city&mdash;James Calcott Berkley."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Jim Berkley hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him? You must. Daddy has always poked fun at me because I am
  romantic. I love romance and all that is colorable in life. I love all that
  is out of the beaten ways. At first daddy's story thrilled me&mdash;then it
  frightened me. When he asked me to help him, I was glad&mdash;because he is a
  dear, even though he sneers at things that are precious to me. He always says
  I'll never find romance in this humdrum city&mdash;but he's wrong!"</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm and he kissed her again. He was calm now.</p>

  <p>"What is your father's name, darling?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>"Cæsar Calley&mdash;of Berkley &amp; Calley."</p>

  <p>"Cæsar Calley!" repeated Jim. "Do you mind if we don't tell your father,
  Ella? Do you mind if I get a license tomorrow and we're married secretly the
  next day&mdash;that will be Thursday?"</p>

  <p>She put up her face to his.</p>

  <p>"Yes... I have an idea that father is playing golf on Thursday."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea that he isn't," said Jim Berkley.</p>

  <p>So on Thursday morning they were married, and Cæsar Calley, with his golf
  clubs propped against his desk, waited impatiently for the arrival of his
  junior partner to release him for his match. In a sense the day was spoilt
  for Mr. Cæsar Calley. In another sense it was the happiest day of his
  life.</p>

  <p>When the telegram came, he sat back and smiled and did not stop smiling
  all day.</p>

  <p>As the bells of St. Olives chimed the half-hour after three, he went down
  into Gresham Street and interviewed the old apple woman in the plaid
  shawl.</p>

  <p>"The young lady hasn't come, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"No, and she won't come any more, Mrs. Murphy," said Cæsar Calley as he
  opened his note-case. "You'll miss the little money I sent you every day, but
  here is sufficient to last you for a year."</p>

  <p>The little old woman took the notes and slid them into her skirt-
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Five shillings a day you used to send me," she quavered, "and I never
  earnt money easier. Not quite right in her head, you said, sir?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"She's recovered now," said the shameless Calley; "quite recovered!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story04"
     id="story04">4. DISCOVERING REX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the office of the Public Prosecutor was a young lawyer
  named Keddler, for whom the prospects were of the brightest until he grew
  impatient with the type of evidence which was supplied him by the painstaking
  but unimaginative constabulary, and went out single-handed to better their
  efforts. And he succeeded so remarkably well that a reluctant Commissioner of
  Police admitted his superiority as a detective and offered him a post at New
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>This offer was enthusiastically accepted, but since the regulations do not
  admit of amateur police work and he found himself relegated to the legal
  department, where his work consisted of preparing statements of evidence for
  his successor at the P.P. office to examine, he resigned at the end of six
  months. To return to his former position was, at the time, impossible, and
  against the advice of his friends and in face of solemn warnings from his old
  chief, he opened an office in the city of London, describing himself as an
  "Investigating Agent."</p>

  <p>Despite the gloomy predictions of his associates, John Keddler grew both
  opulent and famous. The opulence was welcome, but the fame was embarrassing,
  not that John was unduly modest, but because it led on three occasions to his
  identification at a moment when it was vitally necessary that he should be
  unknown to the persons who detected him.</p>

  <p>Starting on a small job for the Midland and County Bank, a matter of a
  forged acceptance, in which the real police had failed to satisfy the bank,
  he enlarged his clientele until he found himself working amicably with
  Scotland Yard in the matter of Rex Jowder, alias Tom the Toy, alias Lambert
  Sollon.</p>

  <p>Rex was wanted urgently by several police departments for insurance fraud,
  impersonation, theft, forgery, and general larceny, but only the insurance
  fraud was really important because it involved a well-known Chicago house in
  a loss of 700,000 dollars, which they were anxious to recover before Rex, who
  was notoriously careless when he handled other people's money, dissipated his
  fortune in riotous living. John Keddler was commissioned by the London agents
  of the company to bring about this desirable result, but unfortunately the
  lean, shrewd thief had learnt from an indiscreet newspaper that John was his
  principal danger, and had spent two days waiting in the country lane in which
  the detective's modest little house was situated, and one dark night when
  John descended from his car to open the gates of his demesne, six pounds
  weight of sand had fallen upon his shoulder. The sand was enclosed in a
  sausage-shaped bag, and it was intended for his neck.</p>

  <p>Taken at this disadvantage Keddler was almost helpless and would have
  ceased to worry Mr. Jowder until the inevitable give and take of the Day of
  Judgment, only the assailant had placed himself in an unfavorable position to
  follow up his attack, though it was helpful to him that the red rear light of
  the car reflected on the polished steel of the gun John pulled
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>He dived to the cover of a hedge and ran, and John Keddler had been so
  respectably brought up that he hesitated to scandalize the neighborhood by
  discharging firearms to the public danger. In some respects John Keddler was
  a slave of convention. But this mild adventure served to concentrate his mind
  and attention still more closely upon the case of Rex Jowder, and so well did
  he work that at the end of a week there was a police raid upon a certain safe
  deposit in the city, and there was discovered the bulk of the stolen money
  which the misguided Jowder had cached (as he believed) beyond the fear of
  discovery.</p>

  <p>Why this raid was carried out is a story made up of John's instinct, a
  drunken man, a frightened woman (Rex was strong for ladies' society), and an
  indiscreet reference, repeated by his terrorized lady friend, to a mysterious
  key which hung about his neck. He would have been captured also, only the
  police were a little over-elaborate in their preparations.</p>

  <p>With his money gone, the fruit of two years' clever and dangerous work,
  Rex Jowder became something more than annoyed. Before him was a life
  sentence, and standing at the focal point of his misfortune was one John
  Keddler. From the point of view of the insurance company whose gratitude he
  had earned, John was not a "good life."</p>

  <p>"What about Jowder?" asked his confidential clerk.</p>

  <p>"Jowder can wait," said John. "As a matter of fact I am not very much
  interested in the man any longer."</p>

  <p>But the man was very much interested in John, and he was content to wait
  too, though his waiting had to be done in a mean Lambeth lodging.</p>

  <p>As for John Keddler, he accepted in a joyous holiday spirit the commission
  which followed the loss of Lady Bresswell's jewelry, for Lady Bresswell lived
  on the Lake of Como, and John was partial to the Italian lakes. Incidentally
  this visit was to introduce him to the Marchessa Della Garda&mdash;that
  unhappy lady.</p>

  <p>From the first the wisdom of Mona Harringay's marriage bristled with notes
  of interrogation&mdash;those little sickles that trim the smothering
  overgrowth of truth.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the Della Garda family hated the Marchessa with a
  hatred born of an enormous disappointment. They referred to Mona as "The
  Señora Pelugnera" (they affected Spanish by virtue of their descent from the
  Borgias), and "Mrs. Hairdresser" was adopted to keep fresh the ghastly fact
  that Mona's father was the very rich proprietor of Harringay's Elixir for the
  Hair.</p>

  <p>The marriage was in every way an amazing one, for Giocomi was no
  impoverished third cousin of the real nobility. Head of the Della Garda clan
  and immensely wealthy, the ordinary excuses and explanations of a marriage
  between an Italian marquis and the daughter of a rich American were wanting.
  They had met in Harringay's Long Island home where Giocomi was a guest. He
  was making his first long absence from the Continent of Europe. Therefore he
  was home-sick and miserable when he met Mona, and their marriage was the
  natural reaction. She, for her part, was fascinated by his good looks and a
  little overwhelmed by the impetuosity of his wooing. The wedding was the
  social event of a brilliant season.</p>

  <p>Not until the liner was clear of Sandy Hook did Giocomi Della Garda emerge
  from his delirium, and face the certainty of his relatives' wrath. For all
  his good looks and his perfect manners, he was not a nice young man. He had,
  in particular, a weakness for approval, one of the most fatal to which the
  human soul is liable, and the nearer to Genoa the vessel came, the more and
  more he resented the existence of a wife who had already surrendered her
  mystery, that lure which had led Giocomi into so many adventures, but which
  had never before yielded him a wife.</p>

  <p>Mona, Marchessa Della Garda, realized the bleak failure of her life long
  before she came home to the cold, oppressive atmosphere of the gloomy palace
  which had housed sixteen generations of the family. Neither the cold majesty
  of the Pallacco Della Garda, nor the exotic splendors of the Villa Mendoza,
  set amidst the loveliness of Lake Como, brought compensation to a
  disillusioned heart-sick girl. But her one and only visit to the Como home
  was not without its consequences. Lady Bresswell, a grateful and somewhat
  voluble lady (her lost jewels recovered without the scandal which would have
  attended the investigations of the police), was showing John Keddler the
  glories of the lake. They had brought her ladyship's expensive motor-boat to
  a rest near Cadenabbia, and the servants were spreading lunch when round a
  tiny headland came a boat, the sole occupant of which was a girl.</p>

  <p>She pulled with long, steady strokes and seemed oblivious to their
  presence, although she only passed them a dozen yards away.</p>

  <p>John Keddler, a man to whom all women were very much alike, gazed at her
  fascinated. The sun in her russet gold hair, the appealing sadness of her
  delicate face, the sweep of her perfect figure, took his breath away. It was
  as though he had seen a vision of some other world.</p>

  <p>He watched her until she brought the boat to a white landing-stage, and
  stepping out and tying the boat, had disappeared behind a great fuchsia
  bush.</p>

  <p>Then he heaved a long sigh, and like a man waking from a dream turned to
  meet the laughing eyes of his hostess.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" he asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I've told you twice, Mr. Keddler," smiled Lady Bresswell, "but you were
  so absorbed that you didn't hear me. She is lovely, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"The Marchessa Della Garda, an American girl who married
  Giocomi&mdash;poor dear. Giocomi is rather a beast."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said John, and that was all he said.</p>

  <p>Sixteen generations on her father's side of hairdressers, general workers,
  coal-miners, and peasants had supplied Mona Della Garda with the capacity for
  endurance and patience, but on her mother's side, she went back to some
  quick-drawing folks who had made the lives of successive western sheriffs
  exasperatingly lively, and when, some six months after John Keddler had seen
  her, Giocomi followed a flagrant breach of his marriage vows by boxing her
  ears, she took a pistol from the drawer of her dressing-table.</p>

  <p>There was excellent reason for this act, for Giocomi was weeping with rage
  at her mild reproach and had flung off to his room in search of a
  hunting-crop. Following him went Pietro Roma, his valet, also in tears, for
  this man worshipped the young Marchessa and would have died for her. It
  nearly happened that he did, for in frenzy at his interference, Giocomi
  clubbed him into insensibility with the heavy end of the stock. He never used
  the whip.</p>

  <p>The major-domo of his establishment, attending the cracked head of the
  valet, heard a shot and mistook it for the crack of a whip, until the
  Marchessa came downstairs wearing a heavy carriage coat over her evening
  dress and carrying her jewel-case in her hand. Even then, he did no more than
  wonder why the illustrious lady should go abroad on a night of storm.</p>

  <p>Later came doctors, examining magistrates, and, one by one, white-faced
  Della Gardas to take counsel together. More than a week passed and Giocomi
  Della Garda was laid away in the dingy family vaults of SS. Theresa and
  Joseph, before the name of John Keddler was mentioned.</p>

  <p>It came about that news reached Rome of Pietro Roma, who disappeared with
  a broken head the day after his master's death and had been seen in
  London.</p>

  <p>"If she is in London too," said Philip Della Garda thoughtfully, "you may
  be sure that she will never be discovered. The English and Americans work
  hand in hand, and they will do everything that is humanly possible to cover
  up her tracks. I am all for employing the man Keddler. He recovered Lady
  Bresswell's jewelry last summer, and even at the British Embassy they speak
  of him with respect."</p>

  <p>Prince Paolo Crecivicca, his kinsman, stroked his white beard.</p>

  <p>"I shall never be happy until this woman is brought to trial," he said,
  "and I agree that this infernal rascal, Pietro, is probably in communication
  with her, for, according to Dellimono, he was the man who betrayed to 'The
  Hairdresser' poor Giocomi's little affair with the Scala girl, and these
  vulgarians would be on terms of friendship. Employ Mr. Keddler by all means.
  Wire to him at once."</p>

  <p>John Keddler arrived in Rome thirty-six hours later&mdash;no miracle this,
  with the London-Paris, Paris-Milan, Milan-Rome air services in full
  operation. Though he answered the summons in such a hurry that Philip Della
  Garda not unnaturally believed he was eager for the job, he displayed no
  remarkable enthusiasm for the undertaking. Particularly was this apathy
  noticeable after all that Prince Crecivicca described as the "unfortunate
  facts" were revealed.</p>

  <p>"In England, of course, she would be acquitted," he said, a little
  stiffly, "and even in Italy&mdash;do you think it is wise to bring this
  matter before your courts? The publicity... the scandal...?"</p>

  <p>Philip Della Garda showed his small teeth in a smile.</p>

  <p>"We are superior to public opinion," he said smugly. "Had this happened
  two hundred years ago we would have dealt with the Hairdresser without
  invoking the assistance of the courts. As it is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As it was explained by the Della Gardas in chorus, this woman must be
  subjected to the humiliations of a trial, whatever be the jurors'
  verdict.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said John politely. "Have you a photograph of the lady?"</p>

  <p>Not until then did he realize that he had been sent to track the woman of
  his dreams&mdash;the woman who had no name to him but "The Girl in the Boat."
  They saw him frown and a queer expression come to his face.</p>

  <p>"I will do my best," he said.</p>

  <p>When he had gone, leaving his employers with a sense of dissatisfaction,
  Philip Della Garda, accounted by his friends as something of a sportsman, had
  an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"<i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>" he demanded pedantically. "I will
  go to London myself."</p>

  <p>Passing through Paris, Keddler was seen by a journalist who happened to be
  on the aviation ground, and it was his speculative note on the occurrence
  which Mona Della Garda read in her Battersea lodging:</p>

  <p>"Among the famous people who now use the air express for their continental
  travels is Mr. John Keddler, the well-known private detective. Mr. Keddler,
  in an interview, says he finds the air-way an invaluable boon. He had been
  called to Rome in connection with the Della Garda murder, and was able to
  make the return journey in a little over twenty-four hours&mdash;a journey
  which ordinarily would have taken four to five days. He left immediately for
  London, and hopes to bring about the arrest of the Marchessa in a very short
  time."</p>

  <p>Of course, John Keddler said nothing about the Della Garda murder, or his
  hopes. He had grunted a "good afternoon" at the enterprising press agent of
  the Aviation Company, and there began and ended the interview&mdash;but Mona
  Della Garda, reading this paragraph, fell into a blind panic.</p>

  <p>For now, the sustaining heat of righteous anger had departed from her, and
  the strain of the sixteen barber generations&mdash;they had been law-abiding
  and for the most part timorous barbers, with exalted views on the sanctity of
  human life&mdash;was asserting its pull. Murder in any degree was to them
  merely a phenomenon of the Sunday newspapers, as remote from reality as the
  moons of Saturn.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, miss, if you ever read them agony columns in the newspapers!"
  asked Mrs. Flemmish one morning.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Flemmish was her landlady and a woman from the Wessex borders of
  Devon, a woman of rolled sleeves and prodigious energy, whose stoves were
  brighter than the panels of limousines.</p>

  <p>Mona had found her room by accident and was perfectly served, for Mrs.
  Flemmish had unbounded faith in the spoken word of her sex, and never doubted
  that "Miss Smith" was a young lady who wrote for the press. Mona had to
  excuse her feverish interest in the daily newspapers.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said Mona, going white. She lost her color readily in
  these days, and her frequent pallors gave her delicate face a fragility which
  Mrs. Flemmish in secret accepted as a symptom of lung trouble.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know who this 'Dad' is who keeps on advertising to 'M.',
  telling her to communicant&mdash;communicate, I mean, with him. Where's Long
  Island, miss?"</p>

  <p>"In&mdash;in America," said the girl hurriedly, "near New York."</p>

  <p>"I suppose she's run away from home," ruminated Mrs. Flemmish. "Girls be
  girls all over the world&mdash;but she ought to let her father know, don't ye
  think so, Miss Smith?"</p>

  <p>Mona nodded. How could she let him know, other than by letter, and a
  letter was on its way. Mr. Harringay would pass that epistle in mid-ocean,
  for he had caught the first east-bound liner, a greatly distracted man.</p>

  <p>If she could only get into touch with the devoted Pietro. The poor fellow
  was in London, searching for her&mdash;a mad search, since he would be
  followed, and he could not find her without also betraying her.</p>

  <p>A thought came to her on the third evening after the return of John
  Keddler. There had been some reference to Pietro in the newspapers. A
  reporter had found him amongst the outcast and homeless on the Thames
  Embankment one night, and had secured a "good story" from him. Perhaps he
  slept there every night? She would search for him. A man's help might save
  her&mdash;even the help of this poor devoted servant.</p>

  <p>"I am going out tonight, Mrs. Flemmish," she said.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Flemmish made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"It's not a good night for ye, mum," she shook her head. "There's one of
  them Lunnon fogs workin' up. Did ye read the paper tonight about the
  Eye-talian lady, miss?"</p>

  <p>Mona's heart almost stopped beating.</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no," she said; "is there any fresh&mdash;which Italian lady?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Flemmish had settled herself down in the chintz-covered arm-chair
  and was stirring the fire economically.</p>

  <p>"They a' set a detective on her, poor creature," she said. "Do you think
  'twas her father that put the advertisement in the paper?"</p>

  <p>Mona had a grip of herself now.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she answered steadily, and Mrs. Flemmish, staring in the orange
  depths of the fire, nodded.</p>

  <p>"If I were her, her bein' a rich young woman, I know what I'd do, <i>ees
  fay</i>!"</p>

  <p>Mona frowned. She had never looked to this sturdy country woman for a
  solution to her agonizing problems.</p>

  <p>"What would you do?" she asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"I'd marry a young Englishman," nodded Mrs. Flemmish. "My man were in a
  lawyer's office an' clever he was, as all the Welsh people are, an' often
  he's told me that you can't arrest an Englishwoman in England for a crime in
  foreign parts."</p>

  <p>The girl could only stare. That solution had not occurred to her, and if
  it had, she would have rejected it, for even the enthusiastic scientist is
  not prone to repeat the experiment which cost him everything short of life by
  its failure.</p>

  <p>"Her has money, by all accounts," said the woman, feeling furtively
  between the bars of the fire to dislodge a glowing piece of slate. "Her could
  buy a husband and divorce him, and even when she was divorced her'd be
  safe."</p>

  <p>Mona stood for a long time pinching her red lips in thought, and Mrs.
  Flemmish turned her head to see if she was still there, a movement that
  startled the girl into activity.</p>

  <p>"I'll go now, Mrs. Flemmish," she said hastily. "I have the key...."</p>

  <p>A light yellow mist lay upon the streets, which were crowded even at this
  late hour, for it was Christmas week, as the cheery contents of the shop
  windows showed. Great blobs of golden light looming through the fog marked
  the blazing windows of the stores, and she passed through a road lined with
  stalls that showed vivid coloring under the flaring, pungent naphtha
  lamps.</p>

  <p>She checked a sob that rose in her throat at the memory of other Christmas
  weeks, and hurried her pace, glad, at last, to reach the bleakness of the
  bridge that crossed a gray void where the river had been.</p>

  <p>A taxi-cab carried her to the West End, and this she dismissed in the
  darkest corner of Trafalgar Square, making her way on foot toward
  Northumberland Avenue. She had to pass under the brilliant portico lights of
  the Grand Hotel, and had disappeared into the gloom beyond, before the young
  man who was standing on the step waiting for his car, realized it was
  she.</p>

  <p>She heard his startled exclamation, and looking back in affright,
  recognizing Philip Della Garda, ran. Swiftly, blindly through the thickening
  fog she flew, crossing the wide thoroughfare and turning backward into Graven
  Street.</p>

  <p>Philip Della Garda!</p>

  <p>He hated London in the best of seasons. There could be only one incentive
  to his presence in the raw of December, and she was terrified. They would
  arrest her and take her back to Italy and a lifelong imprisonment. She had
  heard stories, horrifying stories, of the Italian prisons, where the
  convicted murderers were buried in an underground cell away from light and
  human companionship in the very silence of death. None spoke to them, neither
  guardian nor priest. They lived speechless until the thick darkness drove
  them mad.</p>

  <p>She could have shrieked; the terror thus magnified by the uncanny mirk in
  which she now moved had assumed a new and more hideous significance.</p>

  <p>Marriage could save her! It was this mad panic thought that sent her
  hurrying along the Strand, peering into the faces of men who loomed from the
  nothingness of the fog and passed, none dreaming of her quest. There were men
  who leered at her, men who stared resentfully at the eager scrutiny she gave
  them in the fractional space of a second that the light allowed.</p>

  <p>And then the inspiration came, and she hurried down a steep slippery
  street to the Thames Embankment. The benches were already filled with huddled
  figures, so wrapped in their thread-bare coats that it was almost impossible
  to tell that they were human.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to you?"</p>

  <p>Her heart was beating a stifling tattoo as she sat down in the one
  unoccupied space which Providence had left by the side of the man whose face
  she had glimpsed in the light thrown by a passing tramway car.</p>

  <p>Instantly she had made her decision. There was a certain refinement
  revealed in the lean face, a sense of purpose which seemed out of tune with
  his situation. He did not answer her, but drew more closely to the wreck that
  slumbered noisily at his side.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know how to begin," she said breathlessly, "but I'm in
  great trouble. I&mdash;I must tell you the truth; the police are searching
  for me for something I did in Italy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped, physically unable to go on.</p>

  <p>"The police are searching for you, are they?" There was an undercurrent of
  amusement in the man's words. "Well, I sympathize with you&mdash;I'm being
  sought for at this particular moment."</p>

  <p>She shrank back almost imperceptibly, but he noticed the movement and
  laughed. She recovered herself. She must go on now to the bitter end.</p>

  <p>"Are you British?" she asked, and after a second's hesitation he nodded.
  "Are you married?" He shook his head. "If I gave you money&mdash;a lot of
  money, would you&mdash;would you marry me&mdash;at once?"</p>

  <p>He half turned and stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because if&mdash;if I became British by marriage they would not arrest
  me. I only want your name&mdash;I will pay you&mdash;anything, anything!"</p>

  <p>Her voice was husky, and the underlying fear in it was not to be
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said; "you want to be naturalized by marriage. That's the
  idea?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Could it be done&mdash;quickly?"</p>

  <p>The man rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"I think it could be done," he said. "Tomorrow is Thursday. If I gave
  notice we could marry Saturday&mdash;where do you live?"</p>

  <p>She told him and he rubbed his chin again.</p>

  <p>"It might be done," he said. "I've got a sort of claim to Battersea. If
  I&mdash;anyway you can meet me at the registrar's on Saturday at twelve. What
  is your name?"</p>

  <p>She told him that and gave him the other particulars he asked. He seemed
  to be thinking the matter over, for he did not speak for a long time. A
  policeman strolled past, flashing his lantern in their direction, and he
  dropped his head.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I want to say," said Mona desperately. It took all her
  courage to tell him this. "I only want your name. When&mdash;when it is all
  over I shall divorce you... you understand?"</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the man, and got up.</p>

  <p>"Let's walk along," he said. "I'll take you as far as Westminster Bridge,
  and you don't mind if I cross the road occasionally; it might be very awkward
  if I met a certain person, if I was with you."</p>

  <p>The man kept close to the parapet, Mona nodded, and they were abreast of
  Cleopatra's Needle when he caught her arm and drew her to the recess. The fog
  had lifted and he had seen a tall saunterer walking near the kerb and
  scrutinizing the sleepers on the bench.</p>

  <p>The searcher did not see them, and the man at Mona's side looked after
  him.</p>

  <p>"If you weren't here," he said softly, "I'd have settled an old score with
  that gentleman."</p>

  <p>He left her at the end of the Embankment and Mona went home, not daring to
  think. The next day was a day of torture. She was placing her life in the
  hands of a man who, by his own confession, was a fugitive from justice. And
  yet... she must do it, she must, she must, she told herself vehemently.</p>

  <p>That morning the newspapers had given greater prominence to the Della
  Garda murder. There was an interview with Philip Della Garda, who had seen
  her and had told of his recognition in half a column of closely set type.
  From this newspaper, too, she had a clue as to the identity of her future
  husband. She found it in a note dealing with the activities of John
  Keddler.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Keddler, who has been commissioned by the Della Garda family to
  assist the police in their search, is also on the track of Rex Jowder, an
  international swindler, supposed to be of British origin, who is wanted for
  frauds both in London and New York."</p>

  <p>In a flash it came to her. That saunterer was Keddler&mdash;the man who
  was tracking her down, and her chosen husband was an international swindler!
  She wrung her hands in despair, and for a second wavered in her
  resolution.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, a sleepless night spent in a painful weighing of this
  advantage against that peril, brought her to the registrar's office.</p>

  <p>She carried with her a large portion of the money she had brought from
  Italy&mdash;happily, in view of a flight from the tyrannies of Giocomi Della
  Garda, she had kept a considerable sum in the house. She realized with
  consternation that she had fixed no sum; would he be satisfied with the four
  thousand pounds she brought to him? But what did that matter? Once she was
  married, she would be free to communicate with her father, and he would
  satisfy the most extravagant demands of her husband.</p>

  <p>There was only one fear in her heart as she walked through the pelting
  rain to the dingy little office. Would the man repent of his bargain&mdash;or
  worse, would he be unable to keep the appointment? Both aspects of her doubt
  were cleared as soon as she set foot in the outer lobby of the office. He was
  waiting, looking more presentable than she had expected. His raincoat was
  buttoned to the chin and she thought him good looking in the daylight.</p>

  <p>"I had the certificate made out in your maiden name," he said in a low
  voice. "It makes no difference to the legality of the marriage."</p>

  <p>She nodded, and opening a door, they stepped into a chilly-looking office,
  and to the presence of an elderly man who sat writing slowly and laboriously
  at a big desk.</p>

  <p>He glanced up over his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;" He looked helplessly at the certificate
  he was filling. "Yes&mdash;yes, I won't keep you young people longer than a
  few moments."</p>

  <p>They sat down and Mona utilized the respite.</p>

  <p>"Here is the money," she whispered, and pushed a roll of notes into his
  outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>He took the notes without any great display of interest and coolly slipped
  them into the pocket of his raincoat without troubling to count them.</p>

  <p>Presently the old man rose and beckoned them.</p>

  <p>As in a dream Mona Della Garda heard his monotonous voice, and then a ring
  was pressed upon her cold finger.</p>

  <p>"That's that," said her husband cheerfully. "Now come along and have some
  food&mdash;you look half dead."</p>

  <p>She stared from him to the golden circlet on her hand.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but I don't want to go with you," she stammered in her
  agitation. "It was understood... I leave you now... but you must tell me
  where I can find you."</p>

  <p>"Young lady," the man's voice was not unkind, "I have taken a few risks
  for you and you must do something for me. There is a gentleman waiting in the
  rain for me; he has been trailing me all the morning, and my only chance of
  escaping a disagreeable occurrence is in your companionship."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want..." she began, and seeing his face, "very well, I will
  go with you to a restaurant."</p>

  <p>He nodded and they went out in the rain together. Three paces they had
  taken when there was a sound like the sharp crack of a whip. Something like
  an angry bee in terrific flight snapped past Mona's face, and her husband
  leapt at a man who was standing half a dozen paces away. Again came the
  explosion, but this time the bullet went high, and in a second she was the
  terrified spectator of two men at grips.</p>

  <p>The struggle did not last long. Three policemen came from nowhere and one
  of the men was seized. The other came back to her wiping the mud from his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think he was such a blackguard," he said.</p>

  <p>She could only look at him in wide-eyed fear.</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"A fellow named Rex Jowder," said her husband; "he's been looking for me
  for a month."</p>

  <p>"Then you...?"</p>

  <p>"I'm John Keddler," he smiled, "and I think I've lost a good client. Come
  along and lunch and I'll tell you how you can get your divorce&mdash;I'm a
  bit of a lawyer, you know. Besides which I'd like to return all that money
  you gave me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Whether or not, in the complicated terms of the Extradition Treaty between
  Italy and Britain, Mona Keddler could have been tried in London for a crime
  committed in Rome, no jurist would commit himself to say. John Keddler in his
  wisdom did not challenge a decision. He had an interview with his furious
  employer, who threatened and stormed&mdash;and went home. Mona he sent to a
  place of safety until the storm blew over; but the storm was the mildest of
  breezes.</p>

  <p>The winter turned to spring and the spring to summer. The Italian
  Government notified all persons concerned that the Della Garda "affair" would
  be regarded as a lamentable family tragedy, for which nobody could be held
  liable; and the summer came to autumn again before Mona Keddler sailed for
  New York.</p>

  <p>The question of divorce, in spite of many meetings at luncheon, dinner,
  and tea-tables, had never been properly discussed by either. It was not until
  the evening before she sailed for New York that Mona Keddler asked the
  question that had puzzled her so through the six months of her curiously
  pleasant married life.</p>

  <p>"I cannot quite understand, Jack, why you did it," she said.</p>

  <p>"Did what?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Married me," she said. "It has practically ruined your career, for I
  don't see just how we can divorce one another without... well, without
  unpleasantness. The divorce laws are so horribly strict in England. And you
  are married&mdash;without a wife. It was selfish, miserably selfish of me to
  let you do it&mdash;but why did you?"</p>

  <p>He was unusually grave.</p>

  <p>"For the last reason in the world you would suspect," he said.</p>

  <p>"But what?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Here he was adamantine.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep my mystery," he said, "but I'll write my reason in a letter, if
  you swear you will not break the seal of the envelope until your ship is on
  the high seas."</p>

  <p>She promised, and he watched the <i>Olympic</i> drift from the pier at
  Southampton with a little ache at his heart that nothing could
  assuage&mdash;watched until the trim figure on the promenade deck and the
  handkerchief she waved were indistinguishable from other figures and other
  wildly waving handkerchiefs.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to town, heavy hearted, feeling that life was almost
  done with.</p>

  <p>At that moment Mona Keddler was reading for the fortieth time the scrawled
  words in pencil:</p>

  <p>"Because I loved you from the day I saw you rowing on the Lake of
  Como."</p>

  <p>Her trunks were piled on the deck and she was watching the low-lying
  shores of France with a light in her eyes which no man had ever seen.</p>

  <p>John Keddler had forgotten that the ship called at Cherbourg on the
  outward voyage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story05"
     id="story05">5. THE MAN IN THE GOLF HUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He walked down the stairs from the great man's study, and at
  every two steps he came to a halt as some new aspect of the situation
  appeared to him. He had an absurd desire to sit down on the heavily carpeted
  treads and take his time over his musings, and once or twice he did lean on
  the sloping and massive handrail to allow himself a physical ease that his
  mind might work with greater smoothness.</p>

  <p>Of course, the whole thing was madness&mdash;stark lunacy, and the
  greatest, least reasonable, most extravagant of all the lunacies was John
  Jenner's sublime egotism. <i>His</i> name must be protected; <i>his</i>
  honour must be avenged; <i>he</i> must face the world without blush or
  reproach.</p>

  <p>Bobby Mackenzie chuckled hysterically but internally.</p>

  <p>There were seven more stairs to descend before he came to the broad
  landing from whence one reached the drawing-room and Leslie Jenner.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Bobby, drew a handkerchief from his sleeve, and wiped his
  brow.</p>

  <p>He went down two steps and lingered... down three more and halted,
  drumming the handrail with nervous fingers... then boldly took the last two
  together, strode across the landing, laid a resolute hand upon the doorknob,
  and found his knees shaking.</p>

  <p>And yet he was a sturdy young man, good and healthy looking, practised in
  the ways of social intercourse and one who was not unused to meeting
  difficult situations. Once, in a shattered trench fronting the Hindenburg
  line, he had pushed nerve-shattered men into action with a ribald jest which
  had become an army classic. At this moment he did not feel humorous.</p>

  <p>He turned the knob with an effort of will which would have nerved a
  condemned man to put the rope about his own neck.</p>

  <p>A girl was standing against the fireplace, her back to him. She did not
  look round even when he banged the door. He saw her shoulders shake, and
  looked back at the door.</p>

  <p>"Miss Jenner," he said huskily, "don't... don't...!"</p>

  <p>She turned, and he gasped.</p>

  <p>"You were... laughing?" he asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Of course I was laughing," she scoffed. "Isn't it
  laughable&mdash;father's absurd scheme?"</p>

  <p>He nodded very slowly. He was very fond of Leslie Jenner. Every man was
  fond of her&mdash;a wisp of a girl, light-treading, lissome, quick-
  thinking.</p>

  <p>"I told you some of the story before you went up to father," she said. "I
  suppose he told you the rest?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose he did," he admitted carefully.</p>

  <p>"He told you that I had spent the night with an unknown man in the golf
  hut?" she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the rest." She settled herself on a fender-seat and pointed
  to the big arm-chair opposite to her. Bobby seated himself meekly.</p>

  <p>"I'd been to the Winslows," she said; "they're great pals of father's. Old
  Winslow is one of the two gods of finance whom father worships; father is the
  other. They had a birthday party&mdash;one of their numberless children has
  reached twenty-one without mishap, and naturally they wanted everybody to
  rejoice and be exceeding glad. Daddy was going, but something colossal
  happened at the last minute&mdash;steel rose an eighth or lard fell a
  twenty-fourth or something&mdash;and naturally the world stopped revolving. I
  went alone&mdash;Winslows' place is about twelve miles out of town, and you
  have to cross a piece of waste land that is called Smoke Park. It is a
  desolation and an abomination&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Must you be scriptural?" pleaded Bobby. "I only ask because your parent
  has been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Book of Job?" interrupted the girl quickly&mdash;"'He hath made me a
  byword to the people, and I am become an open abhorring'&mdash;I thought he
  might. Well, to continue this strange story. Nothing happened at the dance
  except that I saw you flirting outrageously with Sybil Thorbern&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Flirting!" groaned Bobby. "Oh lord!&mdash;well, go on."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you were talking most earnestly to her&mdash;Jack Marsh pointed
  out that fact."</p>

  <p>"He would," said Bobby. "I'm hardly likely to flirt with the wife of my
  best pal&mdash;but go on."</p>

  <p>"Coming back at a little after midnight," she continued, "my car stopped.
  There was oil where gas should have been or gas where oil was due, I can't
  tell you. Anyway, Anderson, that's the chauffeur, disappeared into the
  interior of the bonnet and remained, uttering strangled moans from time to
  time, and emerging at intervals to apologize for the weather. You see, being
  a warm night I went in an open car, without hood or anything, and it began to
  rain like... like...."</p>

  <p>"Hell," suggested the sympathetic man in the chair.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;thank you. I was getting wet through, and I remembered that
  there was a shelter&mdash;a small respectable hut which had been erected for
  golfers&mdash;we were on the course when we finally went dead. Without saying
  a word to Anderson, I tripped daintily along a path and found the hut. By
  this time it was raining&mdash;um&mdash;well, as you said. The door of the
  hut was closed, but it opened readily enough and I stepped inside. I was
  within hailing distance of the car, but the chauffeur had not seen me go, you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"No sooner was I inside when I had a horrible feeling that there was
  somebody else there. I went spiney and shivery and made for the door. Before
  I could reach it somebody caught me by the arm. He was very gentle but very
  firm.</p>

  <p>"'If you shout,' he said, in a disguised voice&mdash;I knew the voice was
  disguised&mdash;'I'll knock your infernal head off!'"</p>

  <p>"I see," said Bobby; "he was a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't bad," said the girl; "after that he was quite nice. He said
  that he hated doing this, but it was all for my good, and he hoped that I'd
  have the sense to see that he wouldn't have taken the step but for
  circumstances over which he had no control. In fact, it struck me that he was
  nervous himself."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't see him?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it was absolutely dark. Then I heard the chauffeur's voice shout
  'Are you there?' I was going to answer, but the man put his hand over my
  mouth. Then I heard the car drone down the road. Anderson thought I must have
  walked on, and went along to pick me up. I don't know what I said to the
  gentleman in the hut&mdash;I think I was offensive. He didn't seem to
  mind.</p>

  <p>"'You will stay here till one-thirty,' he said, 'and then you can go
  home.'"</p>

  <p>"The brute! You were terribly frightened I suppose?" said Bobby.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the queer thing is that I wasn't," replied the girl. "I just
  recognized that this was an unusual person. I even made up stories about
  him."</p>

  <p>"Like what?" asked the interested Bobby.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps he had committed a murder, an old feud, you know, and that
  sort of thing, and was making his escape when I came in upon him. I was
  puzzled about the one-thirty. Why did he want me to stay so long? Presently,
  however, I got a clue. There was a sound of a car coming along the road, and
  I saw its head-lamps appear over the rise. It was from the same direction as
  I had come, and stopped at identically the same spot where my car had
  stopped. I heard somebody get down, then I heard a whistle. And this is where
  the queerest part of the adventure began. My jailer literally pushed me into
  a corner of the hut.</p>

  <p>"'Don't make a sound,' he said quite fiercely, and then he walked to the
  door, opened it, and stepped out. I heard somebody say, 'Is that you?' and
  then my man replied in a horrid, gruff, growling voice: 'Nothing doing!' The
  other person made no reply, but I heard his feet scuttling back to the car,
  and presently the car moved on, working up to a terrific pace before it
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"What did your man do?" asked Bobby.</p>

  <p>"He came back," said the girl, "and he was laughing as though at the
  greatest joke in the world. But it was no joking matter for him, for just as
  I started in to ask with all the dignity that I could command that he should
  escort me at once to my home, along came papa's car from the opposite
  direction and pulled up near the golf hut. I heard father's loud voice
  cursing Anderson.</p>

  <p>"'Of course she's in the golf hut, you fool,' he said. 'Do you think a
  daughter of mine wouldn't have sufficient sense to come in out of the rain?
  Give me one of those head-lamps.'</p>

  <p>"He took the lamp in his hand, and then my jailer began to get
  agitated.</p>

  <p>"'Is he coming here?' he whispered. 'Who is it?'</p>

  <p>"'My father,' I said very coldly.</p>

  <p>"'Your father!'"</p>

  <p>"There was a kind of horror in his voice that went straight to my heart,"
  said Leslie. "He turned to me and asked: 'What is your name?' I told him, and
  I think he nearly dropped."</p>

  <p>"He didn't realize how important a prisoner he had, I suppose?" suggested
  Bobby.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sarcastic&mdash;at any rate, father was no sooner on the path
  leading up to the hut, when my ruffian threw open the door and bolted like a
  hare. I saw father's lamp turn in his direction, but daddy could only have
  caught a glimpse of his back. And then, Bobby," said the girl solemnly, "the
  fat was in the fire! Of course, if I'd had a glimmer of intelligence, I
  should have told father the truth and stuck to my story."</p>

  <p>"Though it was an extremely improbable one," said Bobby gravely, and the
  girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was improbable, but it was true. The improbability of the yarn,
  however, struck me first. My imagination was too keen. I pictured just how
  father would stand with his hands on his hips and his legs apart, glaring
  down at me, and I just didn't feel like explaining.</p>

  <p>"'Who was that man?' demanded father, and his voice was so deceptively
  mild and reasonable that I thought I had an easy escape&mdash;and I just gave
  the name that came into my head!"</p>

  <p>"Which happened to be mine," said Bobby sadly.</p>

  <p>"Which happened to be yours," she agreed.</p>

  <p>"Did it strike you," asked Bobby, "that you would have the devil of a job
  explaining me away&mdash;especially as I bolted? That you were spoiling my
  young career, blackening my fair name, and jeopardizing my prospects?"</p>

  <p>"Not until afterwards," she confessed ruefully. "When I got home I went to
  daddy and told him the whole truth, and he said I was shielding you, that by
  heavens I should make amends, by heavens he had half a mind to shoot you, and
  by heavens such a large blot had never been splashed upon the family
  escutcheon&mdash;of course, I knew I was wrong. I know I am wrong now. I want
  you to forgive me, Bobby. It is pretty hard on me you know&mdash;I've still
  to tell Jack Marsh."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack Marsh!" said the young man softly. "Is he an interested party in
  this business?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"In a way," she said; "you see, there's a sort of understanding&mdash;I'll
  tell you frankly, Bobby. I'm rather fond of Jack, and I'm rather afraid of
  him. I'm fond of you too, but I'm not afraid of you. You see?"</p>

  <p>"I see," said Bobby, "and that is rather a good thing."</p>

  <p>There was a certain significance in his words, and she looked at him
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, you haven't told me what happened upstairs. Did father
  ask you to marry me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He not only asked, he demanded."</p>

  <p>"Poor boy," she smiled; "you had an awful difficulty in getting out of it,
  didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Bobby, brushing invisible crumbs from his knees, "not
  at all. In fact, I didn't get out of it."</p>

  <p>"You didn't&mdash;get out of it?" she asked breathlessly, staring at
  him.</p>

  <p>"No," said Bobby, "I didn't. I just said 'All right!'"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean? Do you mean to say&mdash;that you accepted me?" she
  asked faintly.</p>

  <p>Bobby nodded.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing else to do," he answered, with a dismal smile. "He
  insisted upon the affair taking place at once, and was frightfully keen on a
  quiet wedding."</p>

  <p>She had nothing to say, being literally speechless.</p>

  <p>"It is extremely tough on me," said Bobby bitterly. "I have always looked
  forward to a wedding with bridesmaids and crossed swords in the porch, and
  'Hark the Herald Angels Sing!' and all that sort of stuff. I was never so
  disappointed in my life as when he talked about a 'quiet wedding.'"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but Bobby," she wailed, "you haven't really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I had to do it for the sake of your dear old family escutcheon," he said.
  "I don't know very much about your escutcheon, but if it's anything like mine
  it wants electro-plating. Our family has been making mesalliances since the
  days of Robert Bruce."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realized the horrible fact that, quite unknown to her, she
  was engaged.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't do it," she cried vehemently. "Bobby, you must go straight to
  father and tell him&mdash;tell him you weren't the man. The engagement must
  be broken off! I insist upon this! It is&mdash;it is <i>awful!</i>"</p>

  <p>Bobby sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you go to father and <i>you</i> tell him I'm not the man," he
  said; "after all, you're better authority than I am."</p>

  <p>"But this is tragic," she said, pacing the room; "it is monstrous!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," said Bobby, sitting back in his chair and putting the
  tips of his fingers together; "I'm not so sure that it is so bad. Mind you,
  you're not the kind of girl I should have chosen."</p>

  <p>"Bobby, you're insulting!"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," he said; "honest to goodness, I'm not. I have a
  terrifically high opinion of you, and I should never have dared in my
  position to have offered marriage. Your father, however, insists upon the
  marriage taking place immediately, insists upon giving me £100,000 worth of
  shares in his shipping company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is going to pay you!" she gasped. "For marrying me! Bobby!" She
  swallowed something, then walked quickly to the door. "I'm to see father, and
  I'll tell him the whole hideous truth. I love him dearly and I would do
  anything to save him unhappiness, but I am not going to have my life
  wrecked&mdash;I'll tell him that."</p>

  <p>"You might tell him something about my life being wrecked too," called
  Bobby from the chair.</p>

  <p>Probably she did not hear him, for she was out of the room and half-way
  up the stairs before he had finished. She came to the door of the study and
  no farther. Three minutes later she made a solemn re-entry to the
  drawing-room, closing the door behind her.</p>

  <p>"Bobby," she said soberly, "I dare not do it. Poor daddy! I just opened
  the door, and he was&mdash;" she choked.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Bobby interestedly.</p>

  <p>"He was sobbing as if his heart would break," gulped the girl.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have thought £100,000 would have affected him like that,"
  said Bobby thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You brute!" she flamed. "Of course, it wasn't the money. It was
  me&mdash;me." She sat down, covering her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"It may have been me too," said the insistent Bobby; "after all, a nice
  man like your father would be awfully cut up at the thought that a life such
  as mine promises to be, and a career&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your life and your career!" she interrupted angrily. "Oh, what a fool
  I've been, what a fool!"</p>

  <p>Bobby did not interrupt, to agree or deny, and presently she grew
  calmer.</p>

  <p>"I'll go through with it," she said wearily. "I could laugh if it were not
  so terrible."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't even laugh," said Bobby; then: "I wonder if I could persuade
  him&mdash;I'd have had a try if you hadn't told me about Jack Marsh."</p>

  <p>She swung round at him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Just what I say," said Bobby coolly. "It was the mention of Jack Marsh
  which has sealed your young fate."</p>

  <p>"Bobby!"</p>

  <p>Bobby was standing up, his back to the fire, and his lips were tight
  pressed.</p>

  <p>"We'll go through with this marriage," he said. "Maybe it is going to be
  pretty rotten for both of us, but I have an idea that it'd be worse for you
  if I didn't go through."</p>

  <p>Another long silence, then:</p>

  <p>"When shall it be?" she asked, averting her gaze.</p>

  <p>Bobby scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing next Thursday?" he demanded.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Three weeks later they sat on opposite sides of a breakfast-table in a
  private sitting-room of the Hotel Maurice reading their several
  correspondence. Through the open window came the clatter and whirr of the
  traffic on the Rivoli and the indefinable fragrance of a spring-time which
  further advertised its presence in the masses of mimosa, the golden clusters
  of daffodils, and in the shallow bowls of violets occupying every table in
  the room.</p>

  <p>The girl threw a letter across the table to her husband.</p>

  <p>"You'd better read this," she said; "it is from Jack Marsh."</p>

  <p>He took up the letter and read it from beginning to end, so slowly that
  she grew impatient.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do hurry," she complained; "there's nothing in it. I think Jack is
  being very nice about the whole business."</p>

  <p>"Very!" he handed the letter back. "If you take my advice, you'll write to
  him, and having thanked him like a little lady, tell him that under the
  circumstances it is inadvisable that you should meet again."</p>

  <p>She could only stare at him.</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You can add," he went on, "that your husband objects to the continuation
  of the acquaintanceship."</p>

  <p>"I'll do nothing of the sort," said the girl, the color coming to her
  face, her eyes shining dangerously.</p>

  <p>"It is my wish," said the lofty Bobby. "Forgive me if I pull out the
  autocratic stop, but I have asked precious little of you since we have been
  married, and it is not my intention to make any other demands upon you. This,
  however, I insist upon. After we have been married a few years I will allow
  you to divorce me, and you can take as your portion those beautiful shipping
  shares which your dear father bestowed upon me as a wedding gift. But, in the
  meantime, you will do as I wish. Jack Marsh is an undesirable
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"From your point of view," she scoffed.</p>

  <p>"From your point of view too, only you haven't the&mdash;only you don't
  know it," he said.</p>

  <p>She checked an inclination to throw a fish-knife at his head, and sat
  back, her hands folded on her lap.</p>

  <p>"I shall take not the <i>slightest</i> notice of anything you say," she
  said; "my friends are my friends, and they will continue to be such. Perhaps
  you would like to see my other letters? I had half a dozen from feminine
  relatives, congratulating me upon my marriage and envying me my happiness. Do
  you mind if I laugh?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said the imperturbable Bobby. "I can show you letters that I've
  had from maiden aunts, infinitely more comic. I could show you, I've got it
  here somewhere," he searched among the pile of letters at his elbow, "an
  epistle from Uncle Angus, reminding me that the first-born of the Mackenzies
  is invariably called&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She rose from the table.</p>

  <p>"If you're going to be horrid, I will not stay," she said; "that sort of
  humor doesn't amuse me."</p>

  <p>They came back to London a week later to all appearances a happily married
  couple, and London relieved them both of a particular strain, for here each
  had friends and peculiar interests which neither shared with the other. The
  marriage was the most unreal experience which had come either to Bobby or to
  the girl.</p>

  <p>Bobby described the ceremony as being rather like a joint application for
  a dog license, and said that it left him with the same emotions that would
  have been aroused by an appearance before an Income Tax commissioner. The
  "honeymoon" had bored them both, save for the odd intervals when they found a
  common pleasure amongst the treasures of the Louvre.</p>

  <p>London and its gaiety spelt relief.</p>

  <p>A few nights after their return, Mrs. Vandersluis-Carter gave a dinner and
  dance. Neither Leslie nor Bobby were invited to the dinner, but both went on
  to the ball. About midnight Bobby, wandering about in search of his wife,
  found her sitting in an alcove head to head with Jack Marsh. Marsh was doing
  the talking, and by his doleful appearance Bobby gathered that he was telling
  the girl the sad story of his life.</p>

  <p>She looked up and saw something in Bobby's face which she didn't like, and
  took a hasty farewell of her former fiancé.</p>

  <p>"Will you go along, Leslie?" said Bobby. "I'll join you in a few minutes.
  I want to speak to Marsh for a while."</p>

  <p>"Let us go together," she said nervously.</p>

  <p>"If you please," said Bobby, and his voice was firm, "will you go and wait
  for me?"</p>

  <p>Marsh was on his feet too, sensing trouble. Leslie still hesitated, and
  the matter might have passed off quietly only Marsh felt it incumbent upon
  him to say a few words.</p>

  <p>"Leslie was just telling me," he said, with all the geniality at his
  command, "that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My wife's name is Mrs. Mackenzie," said Bobby. "You can forget that she
  was ever called Leslie by you."</p>

  <p>"Bobby, Bobby!" whispered his wife in terror of a scene.</p>

  <p>"And I would add this," said Bobby, taking no notice of her, "that the
  next time I catch you speaking with her I will take you by the scruff of the
  neck and I will kick you into Kingdom Come. Does that appeal to you?"</p>

  <p>Marsh was white with rage.</p>

  <p>"You're a pretty good talker, Mackenzie," he said; "you ought to be in
  Parliament."</p>

  <p>Bobby's answer was appallingly unexpected. Without drawing back, his fist
  shot out and Mr. Marsh went to the floor.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to explain anything to you," said Bobby to his agonized
  wife that night. "I'm only telling you that you must not meet Marsh or there
  will be trouble. In a few years' time, I promise you, you can divorce
  me&mdash;just as soon as it is decent. In the meantime, if you want to avoid
  this kind of unpleasantness, you must also avoid J. Marsh." It was
  unfortunate that Bobby's assault had been witnessed by the one person beside
  Marsh who hated him.</p>

  <p>Sybil Thorbern had reason enough by her own code. Into the sympathetic
  ears of her husband she poured the story of Bobby's infamy. He, poor, good
  man, listened uncomfortably because he was Bobby's oldest friend.</p>

  <p>"The man is a savage," she said, "absolutely undisciplined."</p>

  <p>"Bobby isn't bad," protested her husband feebly. He was a ruddy man,
  twenty years his wife's senior, an out-of-doors man with a detestation of any
  crisis which involved mental effort. "Bobby is a little wild, Sybil, but if
  he hit Marsh, you can be sure that Marsh deserved it."</p>

  <p>Whereupon, stung to indiscretion, Mrs. Thorbern blurted venom. She was a
  pretty woman and had many admirers. Her husband took almost a pride in the
  fact, but the kind of admiration which Bobby Mackenzie had expressed to his
  wife (as she told the story) left a cloud on his brow.</p>

  <p>"When did this happen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The night of the Winslows' ball, a few days before this fellow married
  Leslie Jenner."</p>

  <p>"I can hardly believe it," he said, in a troubled voice, "and yet&mdash;"
  he remembered certain circumstances, a packed valise lying in the hall, the
  discovery of his wife in traveling clothes ready to go out after midnight,
  and the lame excuse she made.</p>

  <p>"I was mad," she excused herself; "every woman has that spasm of madness,
  however much she loves her husband, and for a moment he carried me off my
  feet. And then I realized how sweet you were and how good and ... Douglas, I
  hadn't the heart...!"</p>

  <p>She was weeping now passionately, but her hysteria was due more to fright
  than to contrition. For she had said too much, made her accusations too
  direct, and even in the exalted moment of her vengeance was panic-stricken
  at the possible consequences of her "confession."</p>

  <p>"Douglas, you won't say any more about it, will you?" she pleaded. "I
  oughtn't to have told you."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you did," he said. "I remember&mdash;" he said slowly, "some
  bruises on your arm that night&mdash;did he do that?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, but you won't go any farther with this matter, will you,
  Douglas? Please, please, dear, for my sake!"</p>

  <p>"I'll think about it," said Douglas Thorbern unsteadily, and went up to
  his room.</p>

  <p>The next morning there was a meeting between two distressed women. Bobby
  was out when Mrs. Thorbern called at the hotel where the young people were
  staying, and Leslie, who knew her well enough and disliked her instinctively,
  received the wife of Bobby's best friend.</p>

  <p>"Leslie, I want you to help me," she blurted. "I'm in an awful fix. I was
  very annoyed with Bobby, and I told my husband something about him and I'm
  afraid, I'm afraid...!"</p>

  <p>"What did you tell your husband about Bobby?" demanded Leslie coldly.</p>

  <p>The fact that she had parted from Bobby that morning in a spirit of the
  bitterest hostility did not lessen her feeling of antagonism toward Mrs.
  Thorbern. The woman hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I told him that Bobby wanted to run away with me."</p>

  <p>Leslie sat down suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Bobby wanted to run away with you?" she repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"When did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"On the night of the Winslows' ball, you remember?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember," said Leslie grimly; "I have a very good reason for
  remembering. So Bobby wanted to run away with you, did he?"</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Thorbern hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I told my husband so, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him the truth," asked Leslie, "or were you just lying?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;well, there was some trouble with Bobby and me...."</p>

  <p>"Were you speaking the truth or a lie?" asked Leslie again, and her voice
  was steady. "Personally, I know you were lying, because Bobby would not do so
  mean a thing."</p>

  <p>"Naturally you would defend your husband," bridled Mrs. Thorbern.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said the girl calmly.</p>

  <p>"He's a beast!" Mrs. Thorbern burst forth tearfully. "He has ruined my
  life!"</p>

  <p>Her sincerity was unmistakable, and Leslie felt a little pang at her
  heart, but there was in her composition some of her father's shrewdness, his
  dogged insistence.</p>

  <p>"Did Bobby ask you to run away with him?" She returned to the question and
  knew that her own future happiness was at stake, for she had dreamed of a
  future which did not exclude from her life the man who met her at meals and
  talked solemn nonsense about matrimony.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" cried Mrs. Thorbern at last, and Leslie smiled.</p>

  <p>"That, my dear girl, is a naughty, wicked lie!" she said. "Bobby never
  wanted you to run away with him&mdash;in fact, I'm going to ask him to tell
  me the story, because I am sure you are concealing something."</p>

  <p>"All I want you to do is to warn Bobby to keep out of my husband's way."
  Mrs. Thorbern's voice held a menace. "You're horribly unsympathetic, Leslie;
  I did hope I should find a friend in you."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" asked the girl; "agree with you that Bobby is
  a blackguard? I rather think that I know him better than you."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you have that illusion," said Mrs. Thorbern icily. "Your
  understanding of him was violently sudden; there was something rather
  mysterious about your marriage."</p>

  <p>"Mysterious?" drawled the girl; "but aren't all marriages a little
  mysterious?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thorbern shrugged her shoulders and was on her way to the door when
  Leslie stopped her with a cry. The older woman looked round and saw a light
  burning in the girl's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait," said Leslie excitedly, "this story about Bobby&mdash;this
  story you told your husband&mdash;when did you arrange to run away with him?"
  and then, as the other hesitated, she corrected, "when did you tell your
  husband that Bobby wanted to run away with you?"</p>

  <p>"On the night of the Winslows' ball."</p>

  <p>"And did your husband&mdash;have any idea that you were going to run
  away&mdash;with anybody?"</p>

  <p>"He knew nothing," said Mrs. Thorbern, "he&mdash;oh, what is the good of
  telling you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh please, please tell me," begged Leslie. "I am really anxious to
  know."</p>

  <p>"Douglas found me dressed ready to go," said Mrs. Thorbern slowly, "and
  he&mdash;he&mdash;discovered my dressing-bag in the hall. I didn't expect him
  back that night. He had gone to Edinburgh on some business."</p>

  <p>"And you were meeting&mdash;Bobby&mdash;somewhere near the Winslows?"</p>

  <p>Again the hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was meeting him&mdash;him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At any time?" asked the girl breathlessly, and Mrs. Thorbern looked at
  her with suspicion.</p>

  <p>"I told my husband," she was careful to say, "that I was meeting Bobby
  between twelve and half-past one."</p>

  <p>"I know," Leslie almost whispered the words; "you were meeting him at the
  golf hut in Smoke Park!"</p>

  <p>It was Mrs. Thorbern's turn to show astonishment and uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"You were meeting him at the golf hut before half-past one&mdash;and it
  wasn't Bobby you were meeting at all!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked the woman harshly.</p>

  <p>"It was Marsh&mdash;Jack Marsh&mdash;and Bobby knew you were going to run
  away, and he stopped you&mdash;that's what you mean when you say he wrecked
  your life!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thorbern's breath was labored.</p>

  <p>"Bobby is a sneak," she cried. "He listened, he listened! I'd have gone
  with Jack then, but he caught me by the arm&mdash;your charming Bobby&mdash;I
  had the bruise marks for days!"</p>

  <p>"And he was waiting in the hut for you," said the girl slowly.</p>

  <p>"Jack?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thorbern looked at her open-mouthed, but the girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, Bobby," she said softly, "the splendid darling! It was he who was in
  the hut all the time waiting for you to keep your appointment and determined
  to save your husband's name. And that's why he wouldn't tell me&mdash;because
  it meant giving you away."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he was there?" asked the woman.</p>

  <p>"Because I was there too," said Leslie proudly.</p>

  <p>Bobby came down to dinner that night, glum of face, and found his wife
  waiting for him in the hall.</p>

  <p>"I'm in all sorts of trouble," he said. "I've had a perfectly rotten
  letter from an old pal of mine."</p>

  <p>"He'll write you an apology in the morning," said the girl cheerfully.</p>

  <p>He stared at her.</p>

  <p>"How do you know? Are you going in for clairvoyance or something?"</p>

  <p>"He'll write you an apology, because I told his wife she had to tell him
  the truth."</p>

  <p>Bobby stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"Look here, young person," he said, "what is the mystery?"</p>

  <p>She smiled up in his face.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a scene in public, Bobby," she said, "and do take that gloomy
  look off your face. I want to start off on my second honeymoon without a sad
  thought."</p>

  <p>He stood gaping down at her.</p>

  <p>"When do we start?" he asked hollowly.</p>

  <p>"We'll go by the boat train that leaves Victoria at nine o'clock in the
  morning," she said.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"What about the train that goes to Bournemouth tonight?" said he.</p>

  <h2><a name="story06"
     id="story06">6. A TRYST WITH GHOSTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Once upon a time, in the far-away days of war, there was a
  mythical or semi-mythical individuality whom the British Tommies named
  "Quiff." He was credited with a prescience which was quite inhuman. He knew
  when the divisions were mustering for attack; he warned commanders of
  impending raids; at his word battalion chiefs were superseded... for he had
  an uncanny instinct for weakness. He was the guardian angel of five hundred
  miles of trench line, and was visualized as a white-bearded gentleman, with a
  halo. When the enemy put a price on his head of 50,000 marks (in those days
  marks were real money), thus proving his tangibility, the line was immensely
  startled.</p>

  <p>Nigel Porter was sitting in the shade of his porch one warm day in early
  December, reading a Vancouver newspaper. It was the anniversary of a battle
  in which the Canadians had been heavily engaged, and the writer of the
  reminiscences which he was reading recalled the fact that "Quiff" had warned
  the British higher command of the coming attack. This interested Nigel
  considerably. Later he saw a brief reference to himself, and the mention of
  his having been blown up by a land mine.... The paper dropped from his hands,
  and he jumped with an exclamation. He picked the paper up and looked at the
  date. Then he went into his house&mdash;too big for a well-to-do
  bachelor&mdash;and began routing out cablegrams. In four days he was speeding
  eastward with two suit-cases and a sense of guilt.</p>

  <p>If anybody had asked him why he was taking that cold and very comfortless
  journey, he would have been ashamed to say. A man who owns farmlands in
  British Columbia views the barrier of the Rockies, which keeps in check the
  shrivelling winds that roar down from the frozen north, with the same
  satisfaction that a man, snuggled by a log fire, a pipe between his teeth and
  a book on his knee, might regard the frosted windows and the stout walls of
  the house that keeps from him the howling gale without.</p>

  <p>And here he was, a lover of comfort, and a man who grudged every second of
  the cold months that took him from sight of the Pacific and smell of cedar
  pine, tossing and pitching in the gray, wintry seas of the Atlantic, in the
  teeth of a nor'westerly gale. The ship was not a large one, the accommodation
  was fairly poor, his fellow-passengers... but there was a Compensation.</p>

  <p>The Compensation was amazing in many respects, for Nigel was not a woman's
  man, and was almost, if not wholly, unromantic. If you forgot the
  extraordinary mission which was bringing him across the December sea, you
  might have said that romance had no place in his equipment. The Compensation
  came aboard at New York, and their eyes met for the fraction of a second
  before she stumbled upon the slippery deck (it had been snowing) and was
  caught in his strong arms. There was a murmured apology, an embarrassed
  second of incoherence on his part, and then she had vanished. He did not see
  her till the second day out, and then, literally, he fell against her. He was
  on his way to the smoke-room, a journey which involved alternate climbing and
  sliding along the rubber-tiled alleyways, as bow and stern of the
  <i>Beranic</i> went up and down like delicately poised scales. Again she was
  in his arms for just as long a time as it might take to count three,
  quickly.</p>

  <p>On the fifth day he found her on deck, stretched in a chair, inadequately
  covered by a rug. A little self-consciously, he arranged the covering without
  invitation and they talked.</p>

  <p>Her name was Elsie Steyne, and she was traveling alone. She gave no
  explanation, such as fellow-passengers in the first moments of their
  confidence give to one another, for her solitary journey. When, after another
  day's acquaintance, he offered her the opportunity of telling him why she was
  coming to Europe in Christmas week, she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"...It is a queer season for holiday-making in Europe," she confessed,
  after a long and thoughtful pause, and then immediately; "but I am going to
  see my brother. He went over last week; it was arranged that I should spend
  Christmas with my mother in Ohio. But somehow... I am a little worried about
  him. And you, Mr. Porter? I suppose you are traveling on business?"</p>

  <p>Nigel's blue eyes twinkled for a second.</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly," he said, and she looked up at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he said humorously, "I have a tryst with a ghost!"</p>

  <p>To Nigel's astonishment he saw the color fade from her face. She struggled
  up into a sitting position and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"A tryst with a ghost?" she repeated, and her voice shook.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was dumbfounded by the effect that his words had produced
  on the girl, and he cursed himself for his grim jest. Probably she was
  nervous; there were people in the world in whom the word "ghost" produced a
  shiver.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, Miss Steyne," he said apologetically. "I am afraid I
  startled you."</p>

  <p>Her eyes did not leave his.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked huskily. "A tryst with a ghost? Where did
  you hear..."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly and, seeing the quick rise and fall of her breast,
  the pallor of her face, the queer, hunted look in her blue eyes, Nigel Porter
  became almost incoherent in his efforts to undo the mischief which his
  ill-timed remark had produced.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he began, and then, realizing how fantastical and absurd
  the explanation that he was on the point of making would sound, he laughed.
  "It was a startling thing to say, wasn't it? I am afraid I have a latent
  streak of melodrama in my composition. Won't you please forgive me?"</p>

  <p>She settled back in her chair, and for a while she gazed blankly out over
  the tumbling gray seas.</p>

  <p>"It was stupid of me," she said, "but my nerves aren't in very good order.
  Would you ask the steward to bring a cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>No further reference to his unfortunate <i>faux pas</i> was made. He saw
  her the next morning, when the ship was rolling through the English Channel
  and Devonshire was a gray blur on the northern horizon; and she was
  apparently so absorbed in the book she was reading that she only gave him a
  nod before she returned to a steadfast scrutiny of the printed page.</p>

  <p>The morning on which they reached Cherbourg, Nigel made an unpleasant
  discovery. He had been out of his cabin all the morning, walking the deck, in
  the hope of seeing the girl. She did not put in an appearance, however, and
  he went down to his cabin to prepare for lunch, with an unsatisfactory
  feeling that the morning had been wasted. It was then that he had his shock.
  Somebody had been in his cabin. A trunk which was under the bed had been
  pulled out, and a brief examination of its contents told him that it had been
  subjected to a hurried but thorough search. His passport, which he kept with
  other confidential papers under his pillow, was lying open on the bed. He
  rang the bell, and presently the steward came.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the man in surprise, "I've seen nobody in your cabin. I've
  been on this deck all morning. Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm sure," said Nigel irritably. "Look at this trunk. And
  that&mdash;I haven't opened that passport since I left New York."</p>

  <p>The steward looked round inadequately.</p>

  <p>"There's nobody been in your cabin, sir, as far as I know," he said. "Of
  course, I haven't been watching it all the time, because I've been in the
  other cabins, tidying up."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen any of the passengers near the cabin?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;yes, I have," he corrected himself. "I saw that young lady
  in 87, Miss Steyne. She came down this alleyway by mistake. Her cabin is two
  alleyways farther along."</p>

  <p>Nigel scratched his chin in perplexity. "Of course, it couldn't have been
  Miss Steyne," he said, and the steward, who was happy to agree that it could
  not have been anybody at all, nodded.</p>

  <p>"It has been a clean trip," he said. "There are none of the gangs on board
  that usually work the line, and yours is the first complaint we've
  had&mdash;would you like me to report this to the purser?"</p>

  <p>Nigel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," he said.</p>

  <p>When the steward had gone, he made a search of his belongings to find if
  anything had been stolen; but although the intruder had evidently made a
  systematic search of his cabin, nothing was missing. With his passport had
  been a letter of credit, and this apparently had not been taken from its
  envelope. He was a fool, anyway, to leave important papers lying around, he
  thought, and congratulated himself that he had not suffered any important
  loss.</p>

  <p>For some reason he could not escape the conviction that the search of his
  cabin had been conducted with no other object than the examination of his
  passport. The intruder had been searching for a document. What that document
  was, Nigel could not guess, though he racked his brains for some plausible
  explanation.</p>

  <p>He saw the girl on the tender at Cherbourg, and to his surprise she was
  not only friendly but communicative.</p>

  <p>"I am going to Paris," she said. "You are going too, of course? Where are
  you staying?"</p>

  <p>"I am not going to Paris," said Nigel, with a little smile.</p>

  <p>Again that look of suspicion and doubt appeared in her eyes, but she made
  no further inquiries. He saw her through the Customs, and then made his way
  in a crazy taxi-cab to the town, where, if his cabled instructions had been
  carried out, the car would be waiting. He found it&mdash;an ancient French
  machine, but suitable for his purpose. His temptation was to stay the night
  in Cherbourg, but the time at his disposal was short. He had landed at the
  French port on the 24th, and he had less than twenty-four hours to reach his
  destination.</p>

  <p>As the car bumped and jolted along the <i>pavé</i> road that makes at long
  last for Calais, he could only wonder at himself. It did not seem real, and
  yet it was true that, a little more than a fortnight ago, he had been sitting
  in the sunlight of British Columbia, when there had come to him, in the
  nature of a shock, the realization that he was fast approaching the Christmas
  of 1921. Once he remembered the date, there was no other course for him to
  follow, being the man he was. He did not regret his lost comfort; he did not
  feel sorry for himself; he did not even regret that he was in a car of
  uncertain age, rattling through a driving blizzard that obscured all view,
  that made the <i>pavé</i> so slippery that the car skidded every five
  minutes. And even when, tired and hungry, with the dawn just showing in a
  gray sky, he came into the station square at Ypres, he did not regard his
  adventure as being outside the limitations of common sense.</p>

  <p>Ypres was changed, he noticed silently. Handsome red villas were going up
  in all directions. The Cloth Hall still pointed its maimed tower to the sky,
  and here and there, half covered with snow, he recognized a gaunt shell of a
  house that had been as familiar to him in those painful days of war as the
  Eros in Piccadilly Circus, or the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.</p>

  <p>Early as was the hour, there were workers abroad. A goods train was
  shunting noisily in a station which had been shelled out of existence in his
  days. Facing the station was a brand-new hotel, and he got down, gave an
  instruction to the weary-eyed French driver, and carried his bag into the
  dimly lit hallway. A sleepy man was sweeping the floor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur, Major Burns is here, but he is leaving by the early train
  for England. He has twice been down to look for you. I will tell him you have
  come."</p>

  <p>Nigel made his way to the big, bare dining-room, redolent of new paint,
  and lighted by one yellow carbon lamp. A table had been laid near the window
  for two. This he noted with satisfaction. Burns had evidently received his
  cable and the wire he had sent from Cherbourg.</p>

  <p>There was a quick step in the hall, and the Major, wearing his long
  military overcoat and (as usual) his cap perched rakishly on the side of his
  head, hurried in and offered a gloved hand.</p>

  <p>"I've been over to the station to fix my trunks. I'm going on a month's
  leave," he said. "So you've come back to the salient? They all do. Had some
  fellows here last week who knew you. We were talking of old 'Quiff.' Do you
  remember him? Wonder what happened to the old devil... never heard about
  him&mdash;hasn't even written a book! Do you remember that night when he
  tipped us off about the gas attack...?"</p>

  <p>The Major rattled on reminiscently. He was a red-faced man, with a bright,
  twinkling eye, and he was obviously amused. Men who are amused at seven
  o'clock on a raw, wintry morning, amidst the sorrowful shades of Ypres, may
  be written down as possessing a strong sense of humor.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I'm mad?" asked Nigel, when the other stopped.</p>

  <p>Major Burns pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said at last. "No, I really don't think so. I
  suppose that, having lived in the midst of so much madness these past years,
  one takes a generous view of human sanity. 'Joseph'"&mdash;he beckoned the
  waiter&mdash;"'coffee.' I can give you half an hour," he said to his
  <i>vis-à-vis</i>. "And by the way, here is the plan so far as I can
  reconstruct it from the old operation plans of 1917."</p>

  <p>He lugged out from his inside pocket a thin sheet of paper and spread it
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"There's Kelners Farm, there's Dead Horse Lane, and that's Windy Corner.
  You'll recognize Windy Corner; it's one of the few bits of the old
  battlefield that have been left. I had to get this, by the way, from the
  Belgians, because it was on their front, I think, that this happened. I must
  tell you that Houthulst Forest has entirely disappeared; you won't find any
  trace of it, except a few straggling trees... it's a perfect beast of a
  place, Nigel."</p>

  <p>Nigel was examining the plan, and now looked up as he folded the
  paper.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm mad?" he said again.</p>

  <p>"I don't, probably because my knowledge of the circumstances is more or
  less shaky. If I had a larger understanding of what occurred, perhaps I would
  be less charitable. I only know that you cabled me from British Columbia that
  you wanted me to discover the exact place where you had been blown up,
  because you wished to spend Christmas Day in the hole. Which reminds me that
  I had a Belgian officer in here yesterday&mdash;Colonel de Villiers&mdash;who
  said that the mine craters still exist."</p>

  <p>Again Nigel nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was lucky your being here. Luckier still that I remembered you were
  here, Burns," he said, and then: "I'll tell you the story. It happened on
  Christmas Eve of 1917. As a matter of fact, it happened on the twenty-third
  of December. I was attached to the French corps that was holding the
  southeastern edge of Houthulst Forest. I was working in connection with the
  Canadian Intelligence, and my instructions were to go over to discover the
  exact composition of the force that was holding the Belgian front. The G.O.C.
  wasn't at all satisfied with the intelligence he got from the Belgian staff,
  who were supposed to be <i>au fait</i> with these particulars, and of course
  the French had only recently come up, and were not in a position to give any
  accurate information."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked out of the window, and it came to him sadly that this
  was not the Ypres he knew, that smouldering furnace of a town, bombarded
  daily, hourly, every minute; rocked and shaken by high explosive shells, a
  town that rumbled and thundered night and day, year in and year out; a gray,
  dusty town, where long files of men crept cautiously under such walls as
  existed, on their way to the muddy inferno which lay along the ridges of the
  north. Sadly, for he was thinking of all the brave hearts that were stilled
  and the bright, boyish faces that had gone and were no more seen.</p>

  <p>"The curious thing was that, at the identical moment I went over into No
  Man's Land, a young German officer was sent to discover the exact composition
  of the French force that was holding this sector. We met half-way. To be
  exact, I stumbled over wire in the dark and slid down the edge of the
  crater&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Crater No. 17," murmured Major Burns. "The hole is about twenty metres
  away."</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was on the Hun before he knew what had happened. We both pulled our
  guns, and by the most extraordinary coincidence we both missed fire. It
  looked like being a real caveman's scrap, when the German chuckled and threw
  down his pistol.</p>

  <p>"'I think, my friend,' he said, 'we had better both go home again. It
  would be stupid for us to batter one another with our fists, for that would
  probably mean that we should both be killed in attempting to get back to our
  lines in a condition of exhaustion.'</p>

  <p>"The logic of it struck me, and we just sat down and talked. We not only
  talked, but we exchanged confidences of a highly compromising character. He
  told me that the 18th Bavarian Division was on our front, and I responded
  politely with the information that the 43rd French Division was on <i>his</i>
  front. He didn't seem as interested as he might have been. He produced a
  packet of sandwiches, I had a flask of whisky, and we sat and talked,
  until&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'It will be daylight soon,' he said. 'I think we'd better go home.'</p>

  <p>"So we shook hands, and we were half-way up the crumbling slope of the
  crater, when there broke out the most infernal fire that I had ever heard
  before or since. The air seemed to be so thick with traveling bullets and
  shells that you couldn't have put up a fishing-line without getting it cut in
  three places simultaneously!</p>

  <p>"'I think we'd better wait,' shouted the German.</p>

  <p>"So we retired again to the shell-hole, and prayed fervently&mdash;at
  least I did&mdash;that 'shorts' on either side would be few, and in other
  directions than ours. Dawn broke, and the fury of the fire did not abate. And
  then I found myself talking about things I never thought I would ever discuss
  with a German. He didn't tell me a great deal about himself, except that he
  was an officer in a Bavarian regiment. His English was perfect. I could have
  sworn, when I first saw him, that he was an American. Well, to cut a long
  story short, there we sat throughout the day. Christmas Eve came, and there
  was no slackening of the fire. Every gun, big and little, on both sides was
  in action, and we spent the night counting Verey lights and speculating upon
  what was the cause of this unseemly disturbance. Christmas Day came, but
  still there was practically no reduction of fire. I afterwards discovered
  that this was the preliminary bombardment to an attack which the French
  commander had planned, and which he hoped would bring the Forest into his
  hands. Poor soul! He never lived to know what a hell-trap that forest was!
  Later in the morning the fire seemed to die down just a little, and I crawled
  to the edge of the shell-hole to take observation. What happened I don't
  know. I woke up to find my head on the German's knee, and he was draining the
  last dregs of my whisky flask down my throat. My head was wet and aching, my
  eyes seemed to be filled with sand.</p>

  <p>"'Shell fragment,' he said. 'I don't think you're badly hurt. I have two
  sandwiches and half a bottle of water left. We look like having a peach of a
  Christmas Day.'"</p>

  <p>"What was his name&mdash;did you find that out?" asked Burns
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Karl&mdash;that was all he told me," replied Nigel. "That fellow was some
  prophet! I think both sides must have brought up all their reserves of
  artillery and trebled their stock of machine-guns. It was when I realized
  that we had had no 'Quiff' message from G.H.Q. that I knew the initiative was
  on our side. It was toward the evening that Karl said:</p>

  <p>"'If we get through this, my friend, I should like to have a little dinner
  with you somewhere.'</p>

  <p>"'When and where?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"He thought a long time before he answered.</p>

  <p>"'Maybe we shan't get through,' he said. 'But I'll tell you what I will
  do. If I am alive in four years' time, I will come and meet you here; and if
  you're not here, well, I'll keep a tryst with your ghost.'"</p>

  <p>"Why four years?" asked Burns.</p>

  <p>"He thought the war would last another three. He made it four to give us a
  chance of getting a peace. Of course, it was lunatic, it was childish, it was
  anything you like to call it, but there and then we made our agreement. It
  was the sort of thing that schoolgirls do, and... anyway, there's something
  peculiarly simple and infantile about the full-grown soldier.</p>

  <p>"It was eleven o'clock that night that the French fired the mine. My own
  impression was that it was just underneath where I was sitting, but my
  recollections of the circumstances are necessarily hazy. I just remember
  saying to Karl that I had a passion for marrons glacés, when I felt somebody
  slapping my face, and looked up into the eyes of an English surgeon who was
  in his shirt-sleeves. I just remember hearing him say 'He's all right,' and
  then I sort of dozed myself out of Belgium and woke up in an English
  hospital. The body of Karl was found and buried on the very edge of the
  crater. We took the ground and lost it, took it again and lost it again, but
  I know he was found, because the officer who picked me up after the mine was
  exploded was in the next bed to me in hospital, and he told me all about it,
  how they found this poor chap quite dead and buried him."</p>

  <p>"Hum!" said Major Burns, gulping down his coffee. "I think you're a fool,
  but it's the sort of fool thing I should have done myself."</p>

  <p>He scrutinized the lowering skies through the window.</p>

  <p>"You're going to have a cold Christmas Day, my lad," he said.</p>

  <p>"I never expected any other."</p>

  <p>Just before noon Nigel came out of the hotel with a basket, a bottle of
  wine, and a box of cigars, which he stowed away in one of the car's pockets.
  He himself went to the wheel, and in a few minutes was passing slowly
  westward. The car sped down a perfectly gravelled road, and passed cemetery
  upon cemetery crowded with white crosses, whiter for the rim of snow which
  lay upon their edges, and presently, turning abruptly from the main road, he
  came almost instantly into a region of desolation. The new red buildings were
  behind him. The road was no longer a road, it was a succession of deep holes
  and ruts. Sharp-cornered paving-blocks jagged up from the sodden earth, stark
  walls that had once been houses loomed through the sleet on either side.
  Broken and jagged barbed wire, red with rust, trailed its tangled lengths by
  the roadside, and here and there he saw the drunken outlines of block-houses
  where men had lived horribly and had died in fear. Presently the car was
  lurching between flat heaps of rubble that the rains of the years had washed
  and pounded into little unrecognizable plateaux. A village had been here
  once. Rotting weeds showed where love and life had been, and holes gaped in
  the roadway before a medley of black, wrought-iron crosses which marked a
  graveyard that had been set around a church. There was no church.</p>

  <p>These sights were too familiar to sadden him, though now it seemed, in the
  years of peace, that the ugliness of war was emphasized more strongly. He
  came at last, by the aid of his map, and after constant backings and changing
  of direction, and guided at the very last by a miserable-looking man who
  lived with his family in a deserted dug-out, to the edge of what was once a
  forest but was now nothing. For all that was left of the trees were blackened
  stumps and dead white stems that stood starkly against the cold sky.</p>

  <p>He stopped his car, got out and took his bearings, and instinctively he
  went straight to the place he sought. The hole was deep: it was half filled
  with yellow water. To the right was a smaller hole, also water-logged, and
  he smiled faintly, contrasting the calm of that winter day with no other
  sound in his ear but the sough and sigh of the wind that swept down from the
  dunes, and the tawny sea beyond, with the deafening fury of the storm that
  swept this spot four years before. There was the grave: he saw it at once, a
  small black cross above a slab of concrete that the Government had laid down
  to prevent farmers ploughing ground hallowed by sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Bending down, he read: "Allemand." Karl was "Allemand." In small letters
  was the word "officer." It was not usual to distinguish the rank of the dead.
  That was all. It stood for life and humor and courage, and God knows what
  hope. It stood also for an enemy, but that was incidental and meant nothing
  to Nigel Porter, sitting there on the edge of the crater, with his fur collar
  pulled up about his ears.</p>

  <p>His eyes roved around the starved landscape. It was such a foul setting
  for the rare jewel of a soul.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friend," he said&mdash;his tone was one of heavy jocularity;
  insensibly he had recalled, and was reproducing, the very tone of the man
  whom he apostrophised&mdash;"here am I, after four years! I owe you an
  apology, because I nearly forgot my promise. If I hadn't read in a Vancouver
  newspaper some highly flattering references to my services during the war, I
  should certainly have broken my promise."</p>

  <p>There was such quiet dignity in that black cross, such serenity in the
  truncated pyramid of concrete that marked the abiding-place of this
  "Allemand, officer," that his voice died down. The dead are so immensely
  superior to the living that he felt abashed.</p>

  <p>He sat for a long time, his gloved hands crossed on his knees, his head
  bent forward in thought, and then he got up with a sigh and dusted his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" he began, and his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>Standing on the farther rim of the crater was a tall figure, draped from
  neck to feet in a long, dark cloak. It was bareheaded, and the wind had blown
  a lock of fair hair across the forehead of the man. Nigel stared
  open-mouthed, speechless, and then:</p>

  <p>"Karl!" he croaked.</p>

  <p>The voiceless figure stirred.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! I thought you were a ghost."</p>

  <p>In a dozen strides Nigel had flown round the edge of the crater and
  gripped the outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here!" he asked huskily.... "Stupid question to ask,
  but you are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm keeping a tryst with a ghost," he said, with a twinkle in his eyes.
  "You see, I thought you were... dead. When our people took the ground they
  found a grave here."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he gripped the other by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of this beastliness," he said. "My God! How hideous war
  is!"</p>

  <p>They had nearly reached the sunken road where the stranger's car was
  waiting, when Nigel remembered that he had some responsibility in the matter
  of transportation.</p>

  <p>"You can go back for it. I want to introduce you to my sister. By the way,
  my name is Steyne."</p>

  <p>And there Nigel found the girl.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was after dinner in the barrack-like dining-room of the Hotel d'Ypres
  that Nigel Porter heard and understood.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not a German," said Mr. Charles Steyne, pulling gently at his
  cigar, "I am an American. I was in the war from the very first month."</p>

  <p>"On the German side?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I was on the German side. That is to say, I wore the German
  uniform and served in the German Intelligence Department. There were five of
  us originally, and we were employed by the most effective secret service that
  the world has ever known. I speak respectfully of Great Britain. Of the five
  only one is left alive. Taylor was shot in Hanover after being tried by
  court-martial for running the secret wireless by which the British were
  informed of the movement of German ships. Jack Holtz suffered a like fate on
  the Russian frontier, when he was trying to get through to the Russian
  headquarters the news of the German concentration&mdash;he owed his death to
  the treachery of the Russian General Staff, by the way; and Micky Thomas was
  killed by a night watchman at the German Foreign Office after he had got away
  with some very important documents which were necessary to your Whitehall.
  Long Bill Fenner was accidentally killed by an aeroplane bomb dropped by an
  American airman. And I was almost, but not quite, destroyed by the explosion
  of a mine.... Well, you know that story. If Elsie had only told me that she
  had met you on the ship, and had given me a hint about your keeping a tryst
  with ghosts&mdash;a phrase of mine, by the way, which, coming from you, so
  startled her that she nearly jumped out of her skin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nigel was looking at the girl, and under his eyes the color came to her
  face, for she had anticipated the question which was coming.</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to see my passport, Miss Steyne?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I can answer that," replied Charles Steyne. "My sister doesn't
  realize that war ever ends, and that the price the Germans put on the head of
  their pet enemy is no longer offered. She pictured you a member of the
  Government, tracking down the shy and elusive Quiff&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quiff!" gasped Nigel. "Then you were&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was on my way to the French lines to tell the General not to attack. If
  I had told you I was 'Quiff' you would not have believed me."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Nigel sat back in his chair and stared at the girl, but she
  averted her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad... you're not exactly German," he said, a little gauchely. "I
  don't believe in mixed marriages.... I mean...."</p>

  <p>The ghost smiled wisely.</p>

  <h2><a name="story07"
     id="story07">7. THE CHILD OF CHANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is absurd to say that truth is stranger than fiction
  because, as everybody knows, fiction is the unstrangest product of life. That
  is to say, fiction would be very strange if it was <i>not</i> stranger. For
  if it had no novelty, it would be no better than the News-That-is-Fit-to-
  Print, which is just the dullest kind of printed matter (with the exception
  of the Theology section of a Free Library catalogue) that offends the eye of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>There was a girl who lived in a tenement house in a very poor part of
  London, who used to pray to God every night that a nice clean dragon with
  blunt teeth would seize her and be starting to fly away with his prey, when
  there would appear upon the scene a young and beautiful man in shining armor,
  who would slice the head from the dragon and carry her off to a white castle
  on a purple hill where she would be arrayed in white garments by handmaidens,
  and given bread and milk in a golden bowl.</p>

  <p>She never reached very far beyond that breathless preamble, leaving it to
  God to fill in the blanks of her imaginings and to supply an adequate
  continuation of her story&mdash;which she had designed as a non-stop serial,
  each chapter of which was to be more delicious than the last.</p>

  <p>Her name was Verity Money, and her age was eighteen. She was very pretty,
  very slim, and childlike, both in her appearance and in her faith. Her uncle,
  for whom she kept house&mdash;there were two rooms and a kitchen, and she
  slept in the kitchen, which was warm and cozy&mdash;was a grim old
  market-porter intensely religious for eleven months and two weeks of the
  year, and somewhat unsober for the remainder. He was never unkind to the
  girl&mdash;indeed he was most lavish in his gifts, and had been known to
  present her with such undreamt of luxuries as a feather boa and a musical
  box.</p>

  <p>For the other fifty weeks of the year he was a sober and taciturn
  man&mdash;you can picture him lean faced, with a fringe of gray whiskers,
  poring earnestly over the big print of his Testament and declaiming at length
  on the virtues of Paul and the vacillations of Peter, the girl, darning
  needle in hand, listening with every evidence of interest, but her mind
  occupied by visions of the mythological youth in glittering armor.</p>

  <p>When Tom Money died, he left her about fifty pounds and all his furniture.
  He had been a careful man, and it was discovered that he had paid his rent in
  advance, and that there was still three years of unexpired tenancy.</p>

  <p>So Verity Money lived alone, earning just enough by her needle to keep
  body and soul together, and was happy in her dreams, and as she had no women
  friends, she suffered no disillusionment. Her ideals had undergone a change,
  for a new factor had come into her life. The movies had opened a new world to
  her and shifted the angle of her visions. Now, she was a little girl with
  sunlight in her hair, with a slow dawning smile and little uplift of the big,
  serious eyes to greet the handsome stranger who had ridden into her picture
  from nowhere in particular. In fine, she adored Mary Pickford, and pinned a
  picture of that lady on the wall so that it was the first object she saw when
  she opened her eyes in the morning.</p>

  <p>She would slip from her bed, carefully remove the print, and re-pin it
  above the mantelpiece. She could light the fire and wash the cups, spread the
  table and take her morning tea and bread and butter with a sense of
  companionship which was very precious to her.</p>

  <p>Her heroes were no longer armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>. They were handsome young
  men in sombreros and who wore sheepskin trousers. They rode fiery mustangs
  and earned a precarious livelihood by shooting one another with
  revolvers....</p>

  <p>The war brought nothing of reality to Verity Money. The wilful murder on a
  small scale which was screened for her amusement was more real, more
  terrible, more thrilling than the grand murthering up and down the
  hundred-league line, eighty miles from her door, where day and night the guns
  of Flanders crashed and roared and massed ranks went down before the spraying
  fire of machine-guns.</p>

  <p>The war dawned upon her slowly as one by one her customers dropped their
  orders. Her work was the finest embroidery on cambric and silk. There was
  plenty of sewing work to be had, but she could not make soldiers' shirts or
  stitch button-holes in such quantity as would give her a living wage. She was
  slow and careful, and the few button-holes she made were very beautiful
  indeed, but she earned exactly eightpence in two days.</p>

  <p>She had exhausted much of the money which had been left to her, and there
  came a time when she had to reduce her expenditure to a point which gave her
  one square meal a day.</p>

  <p>She had no friends. There was neither boy nor man in her life. Her lovers
  were living in the sunny places of the world, holding their wide-brimmed
  hats on the pommels of high Mexican saddles whilst they passed the time of
  day with lovely girls who wore divided skirts and rode astride.</p>

  <p>One day she started to starve and nobody knew anything about it. If she
  had died, the coroner would have had some unpleasant things to say about
  moving pictures, because she had spent her last threepence to see a great
  railway picture where half the story was told in the cab of an engine and
  half in the bullion van, where train robbers and bullion guards took pot
  shots at one another with deadly effect.</p>

  <p>On the second evening of her starvation she went to a house in Berkeley
  Square to deliver some d'oyleys. The lady was not at home, and nobody had
  orders to pay this girl with the curious pinched look in her face.</p>

  <p>She came slowly down the steps of the house into the dark square, took a
  few steps, and staggered. Somebody caught her by the arm and pulled her to
  her feet.</p>

  <p>"Hold up," said a voice, but she was beyond obedience, and the stranger
  lifted her in his arms as though she were a child and stood for a moment
  frankly embarrassed by the situation in which he found himself.</p>

  <p>He looked helplessly around, then whistled to two bright points of light
  in the distance.</p>

  <p>The taxi drove up.</p>

  <p>"Take me to the nearest hospital," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Middlesex?" suggested the driver.</p>

  <p>The stranger hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Is it near?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"It's nearest if your friend is badly hurt," said the driver.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I can't say," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Put her in the cab," suggested the chauffeur, getting down; "there's an
  electric light inside."</p>

  <p>"What a brain!" laughed the stranger.</p>

  <p>He looked at the girl lying limp and white in one corner of the cab and
  whistled softly.</p>

  <p>Then he pushed back his khaki cap and scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Now what is the matter with her?" he asked irritably&mdash;irritability
  is a natural condition of man in the presence of a sick woman.</p>

  <p>"If you ask me," said the driver carefully, "she wants grub."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried the soldier, startled; "food... hungry?"</p>

  <p>The driver nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've seen them symptoms before&mdash;I've driven a cab for twenty-eight
  years in London."</p>

  <p>Still the rescuer was undecided.</p>

  <p>"Drive around for a while and if she doesn't recover I'll tell
  you&mdash;then you can go hell for lick to the nearest hospital."</p>

  <p>The car had hardly moved before Verity blinked open her eyes and stared,
  first at the cab and then with a frightened frown at the young man who sat on
  the opposite seat.</p>

  <p>"Are you feeling better?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She saw a soldier, indistinguishable from any other of the thousands who
  had passed her in the mist of her dreams. He was a good-looking mortal, as
  clean shaven as any cowboy or train robber or even as the blessed saint of
  England. His uniform was no different from any other, but the badge upon his
  collar was a bronze leaf.</p>

  <p>She was seized with a sudden panic.</p>

  <p>"Can I get out please?" she asked in a flutter.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he nodded, "but we'd better have some food&mdash;I'm starving, and
  you've made me miss an appointment with a fellow of ours."</p>

  <p>To say that she was horror-stricken at this last revelation, is to tell no
  more than the truth. She had never intruded her influence upon the machinery
  of society before. Not once, by any act, had she knowingly affected the plans
  or movements of others. She felt, as she looked at him with troubled eyes and
  parted lips, that no sacrifice she could make could be too great to repair
  the mischief which she had caused.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm very sorry," she gulped; "I would buy you some supper,
  but&mdash;but...."</p>

  <p>She went red and her eyes were moist and shining. The young man whistled
  again&mdash;but quite inside himself.</p>

  <p>"We will have supper together," said he, with a smile.</p>

  <p>So he brought her to a golden palace of splendor. She was not self-
  conscious and did not realize that she might be an incongruous figure in the
  midst of all this amazing luxury. He noted that she was neatly dressed and
  that she was very young&mdash;she saw only the clustering bulbs of light in
  the gilded ceiling, the snowy tables glittering with silver and glass, the
  gentlemanly waiters who spoke English so funnily, the flowers ... beautifully
  dressed ladies... some of them smoking.... She drew a long breath which was
  half a sigh and half a sob.</p>

  <p>They brought her soup&mdash;thick white creamy soup and curly strips of
  crisp brown sole, and white slithers of chicken, and an ice and coffee. The
  man did not offer her wine, knowing instinctively that she would be shocked,
  and for this reason he denied himself the half bottle of Chablis his soul
  craved.</p>

  <p>He tried to draw her, gently and tactfully, but it was not until he
  touched on the cinema as a method of filling up odd moments of waiting that
  she began to talk. He did not laugh, he did not even smile when she revealed
  herself, her dreams (this she did with a naïveté which brought a lump to his
  throat), and her illusions. He told her something of the untamed places of
  the world, of the country north of Edmonton, of the forest of Ontario, of
  lumber camps on the Kootenay lakes, and of Alberta.</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;you aren't American?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am Canadian," he said, "but that is near enough."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in awe.</p>

  <p>"Do you have cowboys and&mdash;and things like that?" she asked. "I
  mean... is it dreadfully rough there?"</p>

  <p>They sat until they were the last people in the restaurant and the waiters
  stood about them in silent reproach, and in that time he had learnt all there
  was to tell about her. He learnt, too, of the lady in Berkeley Square who had
  ordered d'oyleys and had not paid. Then he drove her home by way of the
  square.</p>

  <p>"Lady Grant is a friend of mine," he lied, "and she would like me to see
  that you were paid&mdash;I will go in and get the money."</p>

  <p>"Her name is Lady Grey," corrected the girl timidly.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I say Grey?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Though she protested that her client should not be disturbed at that hour
  of the night, he insisted; and stopping the cab some distance from the house,
  he disappeared into the darkness, returning in triumph with a whole pound
  note.</p>

  <p>"Lady Green asked me to say&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in consternation.</p>

  <p>"You went to the wrong house!" she whispered in horror; "oh, you must go
  back, please! It was Lady Grey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He groaned in spirit.</p>

  <p>"Lady Grey asked me to say," he went on patiently, "that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you said 'Green,'" she protested.</p>

  <p>"I did not mention the fact," he answered gravely, "but I am color
  blind&mdash;I always say Grey when I mean Green&mdash;anyway, she said the
  work was so well done that she would like you to accept a little
  extra...."</p>

  <p>All the way to her rooms on the south side of the river she was one babble
  of gratitude and adoration; Lady Grey was so kind, so generous, so good.</p>

  <p>He caught himself yawning.</p>

  <p>He went back to his hotel that night singularly thoughtful. A lean man
  from Toronto sprawling on the settee in the vestibule of the hotel rose up to
  meet him, and Private John Hamilton met his disapproving eye with a guilty
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I waited till nine o'clock for you at Frascati's," growled the man from
  Toronto, clipping his canvas belt together, "you're the darnedest
  old&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gee, Corporal, I'm sorry!" said the young man humbly, "but I
  met&mdash;my&mdash;er&mdash;cousin&mdash;and she&mdash;I mean he&mdash;well,
  he insisted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't you try to put anything over me," warned the other, stretching
  himself. "I wouldn't have waited up for you, but I've seen the
  Colonel&mdash;he's going back tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He looked round and lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"There's to be a big attack this week," he said, "and the Canadians will
  be in it. I've made my will," he added.</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked at his lank friend with a twinkling eye.</p>

  <p>"You're a cheerful soul," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yep," said the other complacently. "I've left twenty-four dollars
  seventy-five cents, and any balance due from my army pay, to three lawyer
  fellers in Toronto."</p>

  <p>He elaborated the scheme of his will, which with any good fortune must
  lead to endless law suits.</p>

  <p>"I hate lawyers worse'n poison," he said, "and I guess I shall be as
  cheerful as any poor guy that goes west this week."</p>

  <p>Hamilton was a long time getting to bed that night. He wrote a letter to
  his agents in Montreal and one to the manager of his office at
  Toronto&mdash;he was Hamilton of the Hamilton Steel Corporation before he
  became No. 79743, Private Hamilton of the 40th Canadian Infantry&mdash;and
  another to his London banker.</p>

  <p>For an hour he sat on the edge of his bed, his hands thrust deep into his
  pockets, thinking.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock in the morning he rang his bell and demanded of the
  astounded night porter the address of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The
  request was received tolerantly by the porter as an example of youthful good
  spirits. When the young man angrily persisted, the porter diagnosed the case
  as one of truculent intoxication and went in search of a reference book.</p>

  <p>Verity Money had never received a telegram in her life and had no idea who
  "Hamilton" was. It was an imperative telegram ordering her to meet the said
  Hamilton at Marble Arch at three o'clock.</p>

  <p>She obeyed the summons meekly, for it would have been flying in the face
  of Providence to disregard a message upon which nineteen cents had been
  spent.</p>

  <p>In truth, she never suspected the identity of the sender, and puzzled her
  little brain to recall the Mrs. Hamiltons and the Misses Hamiltons who had
  swum majestically into her placid sea, had thrown overboard instructions and
  orders for embroidered nightdress cases and pillow-slips, and had as
  majestically retired.</p>

  <p>She was dressed very plainly and very neatly in black, and could have
  found no more attractive setting to her undeniable beauty, for she was fair
  and petite, with a complexion like milk and hair of spun gold. Her big
  gray-blue eyes, her firm little chin, her generous mouth&mdash;all these
  details Hamilton took in as he came forward to meet her. She was frankly and
  unfeignedly surprised and glad to meet him. He had joined the angels, did he
  but know it, and was one with St. George and Bronco Billy and other great
  heroes.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you," he said brusquely, and looked at his wrist-
  watch. "We have only a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>He led her to a seat in the park under a big oak. They were free from
  interruption but, as the girl was relieved to discover, within call of the
  police.</p>

  <p>"My name is Hamilton," he said, without any further preliminary, "and I am
  going back to the front by the six o'clock train."</p>

  <p>She nodded and looked at him with a new interest. He was going back to the
  front! It seemed rather splendid and she regretted that she had not paid
  closer attention to the war. But then, of course, she had not known that he
  was in it, and that all the bombardments, charges, minings, and bombings had
  been either designed to destroy him, or to rescue him from danger. For the
  first time she felt a sense of personal animosity against the German
  Emperor.</p>

  <p>"Now, I want to say this," he went on carefully, choosing his words and
  speaking slower than was his practice, "I have no relations in the world, and
  if I am killed nobody will be very miserable."</p>

  <p>"I should be&mdash;awfully," she said, with an eagerness that brought a
  smile to his tanned face.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you would," he said gently, "and that is what I want to speak
  about. You see, a man is always sorry for himself. The thought of dying and
  not being able to continue being sorry for himself is one of the most
  dreadful thoughts his mind can hold. You've read that in books, haven't
  you?"</p>

  <p>She was doubtful, but admitted that she had often read of people who were
  quite bitter at the prospect of nobody being unhappy when they died.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, after a pause, "I want <i>you</i> to be
  unhappy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I shall be," she insisted, and he laughed again.</p>

  <p>"I want you to have the right to be unhappy," he said; "naturally, I don't
  want to put people who aren't&mdash;related&mdash;or connected with me to a
  lot of trouble&mdash;so I thought it would be a good idea if you married me
  before I left."</p>

  <p>"Married you?" she said blankly, and stared at him.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;I couldn't marry you, could I&mdash;without being your
  wife?"</p>

  <p>It was an insane question and she knew it, but for any words she could
  utter, she was grateful enough. She found speech almost a physical
  impossibility, and was amazed that she could speak at all.</p>

  <p>"I have a special license," he said deliberately, "and I have a parson
  waiting. If you will marry me we shall have time for a meal before I go."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I don't think I love you," she faltered, "and that wouldn't be
  right&mdash;would it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to love me," he said loudly; "all you have to do is to
  marry me and be sorry."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>She looked round helplessly.</p>

  <p>She could hardly call the policeman to assist her in coming to a decision,
  and yet she felt the need of legal advice.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to do," she said at length, "I've never
  been&mdash;nobody has ever asked me&mdash;suppose I were your&mdash;your
  sister, what would you advise?"</p>

  <p>"Come and be married," he said practically, and rose.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock she stood upon the platform at Charing Cross Station and
  waved adieu to the man whose name she bore.</p>

  <p>She waited until the train was out of sight, gently twisting the gold band
  upon her finger, and then with a little lift of her chin she came out to the
  crowded courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Cab, miss?"</p>

  <p>She looked at the porter a little frightened, and then with no small
  amount of dignity inclined her head.</p>

  <p>The cab drew up.</p>

  <p>"Where do you want to go, miss?" demanded the driver.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. John Hamilton!" said the girl and grew for a moment incoherent. "I
  mean&mdash;oh, Hagan's Rents, please!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Verity Money learnt much from books. Even by cultured standards she was
  well read, but she found neither in Dickens, nor Dumas, nor in the efforts of
  the modern authors any situation analogous to her own. Nor did the cinema
  help her, though she indulged in a systematic search for parallels.</p>

  <p>She had letters from her husband&mdash;kindly, brotherly letters. He had
  been in a big fight, and had come out without a scratch, though his friend
  ("you remember the Corporal who was at the church?") had been severely
  wounded, though he was now on the way to recovery. Was she well? Did she
  receive her allowance regularly? Had she moved as he suggested to the
  furnished flat he had urged her to take?</p>

  <p>She answered his letters in a firm, childish hand, perfectly punctuated,
  and to his surprise and relief not only literate but literary in the sense
  that they conveyed a freshness and a clarity of view which was little short
  of marvelous.</p>

  <p>"I shall try to be a good wife to you," she wrote, "and I am already
  reading the newspapers carefully. I have written to Lord
  Kitchener&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sat back on the step of the trench and gasped&mdash;then he laughed and
  laughed till the tears rolled down his face.</p>

  <p>"I have written to Lord Kitchener to ask him when the war will be over,
  and he has written to me saying that he isn't sure, but he will let me know.
  I hope our marriage isn't a mistake, but I will try to be worthy of a hero
  who is fighting for his country. I have a picture of a Canadian soldier, and
  I am learning to sing 'The Maple Leaf.' I went to the flower shop in Regent
  Street and asked them if they had any maple leaves, but they had none. It was
  so silly of me, but I did want to buy some."</p>

  <p>When John Hamilton came out of the trenches he went to No. 8 Base Hospital
  and saw a certain swathed and bandaged corporal, and discussed matters.</p>

  <p>"Well, Don Quixote, and how is Mrs. Don?" asked the voice behind a large
  square of medicated gauze.</p>

  <p>John sat on the bed and read extracts from the letter.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were crazy," said the wounded man, "but I guess you've
  instinct. There's the making of a woman in that child. You're not feeling
  sorry for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I'm looking forward to life&mdash;it has possibilities,"
  said the other.</p>

  <p>Verity Hamilton in the Baker Street flat, with a maid of her own, was a
  serious little figure facing those possibilities for herself.</p>

  <p>She adored her ten-minute husband because she was made to adore those who
  were kind to her. She prayed for him, she evolved great plans for his future,
  and she fought hard against the pin-point of doubt which had come into her
  mind and which was growing with every day which passed.</p>

  <p>In a sense he had fulfilled her ideals and her dreams, for he had come
  violently into her life and had in a sense saved her from destruction. At any
  rate he had given her food when she was very hungry. And then she had seen
  him again&mdash;and whisk! she was married!</p>

  <p>She used to sit with compressed lips, and eyes that were fixed in the
  far-away, wondering&mdash;and doubting.</p>

  <p>He could not love her: he had never said that he did. He had not so much
  as kissed her, and it was only the strong grip of his hand that she
  remembered.</p>

  <p>Her problem was a simple one. She loved her husband and he did not love
  her. Why he had married her she did not ask herself, curiously enough. Who
  was she to inquire into his godlike whims?</p>

  <p>How could she make her husband love her? That was the problem, and
  presently a fortuitous visit to the movies told her.</p>

  <p>Four months after his marriage, John Hamilton was sent to England on sick
  leave pending his discharge. The shrapnel bullet which was responsible for so
  much left him with a perceptible limp, and there was a big chance that he
  might rid himself of all traces of his wound (so the army doctors told him),
  but it would take time.</p>

  <p>He arrived at Southampton in the early hours of a spring morning, and
  telegraphed to his wife that he would be staying at the Cranbourne Hotel and
  that he would call and see her.</p>

  <p>He expected she would be waiting for him at Waterloo, but here he was
  disappointed and a little hurt. Yet&mdash;he had heard something of the
  commotion she had caused at the War Office when the news of the wounding had
  come through; of how she had appeared armed with a letter authorizing her to
  call upon a high personage. Being somewhat vague as to her husband's position
  in the army since he had been promoted to lance-corporal, she had described
  him as "Colonel," which accounted for her facilities.</p>

  <p>And she had demanded to be taken at once to the Holy of Holies to meet the
  steel-eyed man from Khartoum, and had wept on the breast of a flustered field
  officer when that permission had been gently denied her.</p>

  <p>All this John Hamilton had learnt, and, lying on his back in the
  Versailles hospital, had chuckled the morning through at the recital.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she had a surprise for him? She had indeed.</p>

  <p>When he came to her flat the maid opened the door expectantly and
  primly.</p>

  <p>Would he go to the drawing-room&mdash;Mrs. Hamilton was waiting.</p>

  <p>The drawing-room door was opened and he was announced. He did not hear the
  door close behind him, for he stood out of breath and speechless looking down
  at the girl.</p>

  <p>She was seated in a low chair before the fire, and on her knees lay a tiny
  pink-faced thing that scowled and spluttered and stared into space.</p>

  <p>"My God!" whispered John Hamilton.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him serenely with that smile which was peculiarly her
  own.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he lovely?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>John Hamilton said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Whose&mdash;whose baby is that?" he managed to say at last.</p>

  <p>"Mine," she said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Y-yours&mdash;how old is it?" he asked, a cold sweat of apprehension
  breaking over him.</p>

  <p>"Two months," she said.</p>

  <p>He sat down heavily and she looked across at him with growing
  distress.</p>

  <p>"Oh dear&mdash;please, aren't you glad?" she pleaded. "I thought you would
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glared from the child to Verity and from Verity to the child, and then
  he laughed, but it was not a happy laugh.</p>

  <p>"What an ass I am!" he said, half to himself. "What a stupid blind
  fool!"</p>

  <p>The tears were standing in her eyes, tears of disappointment and chagrin.
  She was hurt&mdash;he saw the immeasurable pain in her eyes and was kneeling
  by her side in an instant.</p>

  <p>"My dear, my dear," he said softly, "I am an awful brute&mdash;but it was
  such a surprise and I had no idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;it would make you so happy," she sobbed. "I wanted
  you&mdash;to love me&mdash;and children bring people together as nothing else
  does&mdash;I've seen it in stories and things."</p>

  <p>He patted her hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear&mdash;but this is not&mdash;my child."</p>

  <p>She looked at him open-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is your child!" she cried.</p>

  <p>John Hamilton rose unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I think&mdash;I rather think you're wrong," he said, his head
  whirling.</p>

  <p>She laid the unconscious cause of her unhappiness upon the downy deeps of
  the big arm-chair and faced him, her hands clasped behind her back.</p>

  <p>"It's no use trying," she said brokenly. "I thought you would love a
  little baby about the house&mdash;I'll have to send it back."</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"Send it back!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>He took her by the wrists and gently pulled her hands apart.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I was going to adopt it," she gulped. "I have it on a
  week's&mdash;a week's trial&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took her in his arms and his laughter filled the flat with joyful
  sound. The baby on the sofa, scenting disaster for itself, opened its little
  red mouth very wide, screwed up its eyes into the merest buttons and added
  its voice to the chorus.</p>

  <h2><a name="story08"
     id="story08">8. THE DEAR LIAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia Crest walked back to her surgery, her quick steps
  beating time to the song of triumph in her heart. She had declined Jonas
  Picton's offer to send her home in one of his many cars. Walking, movement of
  any kind, physical action she wanted to work down the bubbling exuberance
  which was within her. So she swung down the hill from the big house and
  through Broadway into busy Market Street, and people who knew her and who
  observed the lifted chin and the light in her eyes, saw Tollford's one woman
  doctor as a new being. They saw, though this they could not know, merely the
  reaction from months of depression bordering upon despair, months of waiting
  when her most precious quality, her faith in herself and her invincibility
  had been gradually shrinking until she had almost lost hold.</p>

  <p>For she had thrown down the gage to the town of Tollford, and until this
  morning the glove lay moulding where it fell.</p>

  <p>If Tollford had not been founded a couple of hundred years before the
  birth of Jonas Picton, it might and undoubtedly would have been known to
  history as Pictonville. It is on record that Jonas offered pretty substantial
  inducements, including the building of a new Town Hall, the presentation of a
  town park, and the equipment of a new Fire Station to induce such a change of
  name; but Tollford was more conservative in those days before Picton's tall
  smoke stacks stabbed the skyline east and north, and his great glass-roofed
  factory buildings sprawled half-way down the valley.</p>

  <p>And when the Picton works, and some eight thousand Picton employees, had
  become so important a factor in the municipal life of Tollford, Jonas had
  outgrown the desire for advertisement and had found life held something
  bigger than the flattery of a purchased honour.</p>

  <p>Yet, in every other sense, Tollford remained conservative. Strangers who
  came and surveyed the town and marked it down as easy, who saw gold lying on
  the sidewalks waiting to be lifted, and returned joyously to show Tollford
  how much better stores, theatres, and newspapers could be run&mdash;these
  people lost money.</p>

  <p>Dr. Sylvia Crest had come straight to Tollford from Mercer's Hospital, her
  diploma painfully new but her heart charged with confidence. She, too, had
  surveyed the land and had duly noted the poverty of medical resources in the
  town. Of women doctors there were none&mdash;and there were at least four
  thousand women employed at Picton's. She sat down the night following her
  visit to Tollford, and, with a pencil and paper and the local health
  statistics before her, she took stock of opportunity and found the prospects
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>So she arrived one dull day in February, rented a corner house, furnished
  her rooms with proper severity, put up her sign, and waited. The local
  newspaper man gave her a most outrageous puff, for Sylvia was
  pretty&mdash;the prettiness of regular features and a skin like silk; but,
  brazen sign and as brazen advertisement notwithstanding, few patients sought
  the advice of the new doctor.</p>

  <p>Tollford was conservative.</p>

  <p>Moreover, working women did not like women doctors. About the female of
  the medical profession all manner of legends circulated. Women practitioners
  (by local and even more general account) did not treat women as kindly as men
  doctors. They were liable to fainting spells, and think what would happen if,
  in the middle of a critical operation, the doctor needed medical
  attention!</p>

  <p>All these things were said and agreed upon in the lunch hour at Picton's,
  when the women talked over the new arrival.</p>

  <p>"I'd as soon die as have a woman doctor fussing round me," said one
  oracle, and her light-hearted preference for death before the attentions of
  one of her sex was endorsed with unanimity.</p>

  <p>A haggard and droop-lipped Jonas Picton sitting in his ornate office at
  the works had heard of Dr. Sylvia Crest, and sighed. Where the great Steyne,
  most famous of modern physicians, had failed to find any other remedy than
  the knife, and offered even that dread remedy without assurance of cure, what
  hope could a "bit of a girl" bring? His secretary had pointed her out to him
  once when he was driving through Tollford. And yet one day in sheer
  desperation he had sent for her. The messenger had come at a moment when Dr.
  Sylvia was facing, perilously near tears, an accumulation of bills which
  called for an earlier settlement than her bank manager could sanction. No
  wonder that the sun shone more wonderfully, and the homely folk of Tollford
  took on a foreign charm under her benignant eyes as she made her way
  homeward.</p>

  <p>Alan Brock was waiting in her study, and the hearth she had left clean and
  tidy was strewn with his cigarette ends. She looked suspiciously at him as
  she came in, his face was more yellow, his appearance more untidy than usual,
  and he had not shaved.</p>

  <p>He was the one doctor in Tollford who had given her welcome&mdash;he was
  more presentable the first day he had called upon her&mdash;and she had been
  grateful. She did not realize until later that in seeking her out he had
  advertised his belief in her failure.</p>

  <p>Alan Brock had neither friend nor practice in Tollford, and for good
  reason.</p>

  <p>She took off her wrap, her disapproving eyes upon the figure sprawling in
  the one easy-chair she possessed.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Brock, you have been taking morphine again," she said
  severely.</p>

  <p>He chuckled, stretching out his hand to flick away the ashes of his
  cigarette. "I must keep one patient, you know," he grinned, "to alleviate
  suffering, to restore vitality&mdash;what used old Professor Thingummy say
  were the three duties of medicine?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>She was too elated to take anything but a charitable view even of one
  whose acquaintance she was determined to drop.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go away from here?" she asked. "You need not be a
  doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The good people of Tollford make it obvious," he growled.</p>

  <p>"You have money," she went on; "why stay here where&mdash;" She stopped,
  and he looked up.</p>

  <p>"Where I'm not exactly respected, eh?" he asked. "Well, there are several
  reasons, and you're one of them."</p>

  <p>"Me?" she was genuinely surprised.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you. Do you know, Sylvia, doctoring isn't your line. You haven't the
  temperament for it, for one thing&mdash;it's a horrible profession for a
  woman, anyway."</p>

  <p>Her lips were set tight now.</p>

  <p>"That isn't the view you took a month ago, Dr. Brock," she said, and he
  waved his hand feebly.</p>

  <p>"A few weeks ago I wanted to know you and I wasn't such a fool as to start
  right in telling you your faults. Sylvia, you and I are both hopeless
  failures."</p>

  <p>He rose unsteadily and reached out his hand. Had she not moved quickly it
  would have rested on her arm.</p>

  <p>"I want you to listen to me, Dr. Brock," she said quietly. "There is
  nothing in our relationship which justifies your calling me by my Christian
  name. There is, I am sorry to say, very little in our common profession which
  makes a continuance of our friendship possible or desirable&mdash;even the
  communion of failure has no attraction for me."</p>

  <p>He was standing by the table, swaying slightly. The effect of the morphine
  was beginning to wear off and his face was drawn and haggard. He muttered
  something and sank back to his chair. Then lifting his sunken head with an
  unexpected alertness:</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I've got money, that's true. I tell you I'm mighty
  fond of you, and that's true also. Why don't you throw up this business and
  come away? It would make a new man of me, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I was fond of you, which I'm not, marrying a man to reform him
  would be a pretty thin occupation; and, honestly, I don't think you're going
  to be cured."</p>

  <p>"You're certain about that, are you?" he said, with an ugly little
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize," he asked suddenly, "that you're certain about almost
  everything?"</p>

  <p>He was surprised to see the red come into her face. Later he was to learn
  the reason why.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said humbly. "Don't let us quarrel&mdash;anyway, I'm
  leaving this hole. How did you get on this morning? Did you see the kid?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the child," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Well?" He was looking at her queerly. There was something skeptical and
  challenging in his attitude which annoyed her, until she remembered that
  there had been a time when this broken man had been Picton's family
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"I saw the child," she said again, "and I think that the trouble is
  local&mdash;in fact, I am certain." She cut the word short, as though it had
  slipped out against her will, and again she flushed.</p>

  <p>"You think the spinal trouble will yield to treatment&mdash;in fact,
  you're certain, eh?" he said slowly. "Well, you're putting your opinion
  against the biggest expert."</p>

  <p>"I realize that," she replied; "but I must say what I believe. I gave the
  child a thorough examination; she's a pretty little girl, isn't she? I am
  satisfied that with massage and fairly simple local remedies, the swelling on
  the back can be absorbed."</p>

  <p>Brock was silent. He sat with his chin on his hands looking into the
  fire.</p>

  <p>At last he broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"And naturally old man Picton fell on your neck and blessed you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He was rather grateful&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said the other grimly, "that's the kind of verdict he's been
  trying to get for years. Jonas Picton hates the knife. His wife died on the
  table. His mother died in similar circumstances, and I believe one of his
  sisters had a very unhappy experience at the hands of a fashionable surgeon.
  It is just the knife that he wants to avoid, and naturally he believed you
  and was glad to swallow everything you told him. Do you know what you are,
  Sylvia? You're the straw, and he clutched you!"</p>

  <p>The girl repressed her irritation with an effort.</p>

  <p>"I gave what I believe to be an honest opinion," she said.</p>

  <p>Dr. Brock had reached out his hand and taken a book from the bookcase and
  was looking at it idly. He turned the cover.</p>

  <p>"S.A.C.&mdash;your initials," he said. "'Sure and Certain,' eh?" He
  laughed.</p>

  <p>This time she made no attempt to conceal her anger.</p>

  <p>"You are not quite as original as you think, Dr. Brock," she said, her
  lips trembling. "Those initials have been interpreted that way before by a
  man who would be a little more competent than you to sit in judgment on my
  diagnosis."</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>He had reached the stage in morphiomania where he found it impossible to
  take offense at rebuffs more pointed than Sylvia Crest's.</p>

  <p>"John Wintermere," she said shortly, and he whistled.</p>

  <p>"I remember," he said softly. "I heard some story about it from Mercers.
  He was rather sweet on you, wasn't he, and you had an awful row with him when
  you were a student, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl had opened the door.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me now, Dr. Brock, I shall be very glad to have this
  room," she said. "I am expecting some patients."</p>

  <p>"Wintermere, eh?" He rose slowly, groping for his hat. "Good chap,
  Wintermere. He's married now, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>He saw the girl's face go white.</p>

  <p>"Married?" she faltered. "I don't know&mdash;perhaps&mdash;at any rate,
  it's no business of mine."</p>

  <p>He chuckled. The effect of the marriage invention on the spur of the
  moment satisfied him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he isn't&mdash;now I come to think of it. I was wrong to say he
  was married. Scared you, didn't it?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer.</p>

  <p>He turned at the door of the little house. "Jonas has taken you up and
  you'll get all the patients you want now, but, take my advice, combine
  business and pleasure by getting John Wintermere down to see Picton's kid.
  Picton has funked sending for him, though he knows Wintermere's opinion is
  the last word on spinal trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door was slammed viciously in his face.</p>

  <p>It seemed almost as though Brock's prophecy was to be fulfilled. As if
  some secret courier had run from house to house telling Tollford that the new
  woman doctor was under the sublime patronage of Jonas Picton and was no
  longer to be avoided. Patients appeared miraculously. Never before had Dr.
  Sylvia Crest's waiting-room been so crowded as it was that night.</p>

  <p>She called the next day at the big house to see her little patient.
  Picton's car was at the door, and, as she walked up, the big man was pulling
  on his gloves in the hall and greeted her with almost pathetic eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Just come into the library, doctor," he said, opening a door. "I want to
  talk to you about Fay."</p>

  <p>He ushered her into the room, closed the door behind her, and lowered his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell you yesterday, doctor, that I had consulted Dr. Steyne.
  You've heard of Steyne?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of him," she smiled, "and I also know that you've consulted
  him."</p>

  <p>Picton looked relieved.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to hear that," he said. "Somehow I didn't like telling you for
  fear"&mdash;he laughed a little nervously&mdash;"for fear the knowledge that
  Steyne had seen her would influence your opinion. You know that he takes a
  different view from yours? He calls the disease some infernal long name and
  says that it cannot be cured save by an operation, and that it is extremely
  rare that such operations are successful. Sit down, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He followed her example, stripping off his gloves as he spoke, and gaining
  something of the animation and forcefulness which Tollford associated with
  his dominating personality.</p>

  <p>"There's another man, Wintermere," Picton went on. "You've heard of
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard of him," said Sylvia steadily.</p>

  <p>"Well, they wanted me to bring him down to see the child, and I've heard
  that he's a pretty clever man. I met him when I was on my vacation, and he
  seems a very clever fellow, though a bit young looking for a specialist."</p>

  <p>The name of John Wintermere invariably annoyed her. Today, with the memory
  of Brock's gibes so fresh in her mind, there was sounder reason for her
  irritation. But John Wintermere had been her master in surgery, and common
  decency demanded a testimonial.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should be deceived by his youthful appearance, Mr.
  Picton," she said. "I think he is the greatest surgeon in this country."</p>

  <p>Jonas Picton pulled a wry face.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any great surgeons," he said shortly. "I want a cure without
  surgery. And you think you can do it, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Only for the fraction of a second did Sylvia hesitate.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so, yes, I am cer&mdash;I am confident I can cure the
  child," she said, and if he noticed her confusion of terms he made no
  comment.</p>

  <p>He rose quickly and gripped her arm with his big hand.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, and his voice was a little shaky, "put my girl right
  and you shall never regret having come to Tollford."</p>

  <p>Sylvia went up alone to the room of her patient, and she seemed to have
  lost something of the sprightliness of mind with which she had greeted the
  day.</p>

  <p>In a large room chosen for its situation because its windows offered no
  view of her father's commercial activities, was the center and soul of Jonas
  Picton's existence.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Miss Doctor!" said a cheery voice from the white bed, and Sylvia
  went across to her patient and took the thin hand in hers.</p>

  <p>Fay Picton was seventeen and a prodigious bookworm; books covered the
  table by the side of the bed and filled two long cases which ran the length
  of the room. She was a pretty, fairy-like thing who turned big, smiling eyes
  to the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"You're the first interesting doctor I've had," she said, "and I've had a
  lot. Your name is Sylvia, and it's what I'm going to call you. I couldn't
  tell you this yesterday because Daddy was here, and I had to appear impressed
  by all that stuff you were talking."</p>

  <p>"And weren't you impressed?" smiled Sylvia, as she sat by the bed.</p>

  <p>"Not a dreadful lot," said the girl, with disconcerting frankness. "You
  see, I know much more about my unhappy case than you or Daddy. I've read a
  lot about it."</p>

  <p>But Sylvia was nettled. To suggest the fallibility of the young is
  outrageous.</p>

  <p>"You ought not to have read any medical books," she said severely.</p>

  <p>"Oh, skittles," said the patient contemptuously; "you don't suppose they'd
  let me have medical books, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, where did you read about it?"</p>

  <p>"In the encyclopædia, of course. Everything's in the encyclopædia, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia, for the first time in her life, was genuinely embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway, we're going to cure you," she said cheerily, and Fay Picton
  laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you're <i>not</i> going to cure me," she said calmly. "This
  thing is more or less incurable. The only remedy is an operation, and there
  have been just four cases where an operation has been successful. Only Daddy
  shrieks inside himself at the very idea&mdash;poor soul!"</p>

  <p>This was not exactly the start which Dr. Sylvia Crest had expected. She
  was dismayed at the thought that her task was to be doubly difficult and that
  she had two fights to wage&mdash;one against the disease and one against the
  skepticism of this self-possessed young person.</p>

  <p>"You see, doctor dear, the spine and all its eccentricities is <i>terra
  nova</i> to the poor doctor," the patient went on remorselessly. She stopped
  suddenly as she saw the look in Sylvia's face. "I'm awfully sorry." She put
  out her hand and laid it on Sylvia's knee. "Anyway, it doesn't matter; do
  your best and come every day and talk to me, and I'll pray hard for faith in
  your treatment."</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of the curious and torturing friendship which shook
  the self-confidence of Sylvia Crest more than the admonitions of professors
  or the jeers of Alan Brock.</p>

  <p>"Fay is quite brightening up under the care of that woman doctor," Picton
  told his cronies, his managers, and the few who enjoyed the privilege of
  intimate friendship with him. "Never saw her looking so cheerful, my
  boy."</p>

  <p>One afternoon Sylvia went in haste to her patient, obeying an urgent
  telephone summons from the nurse, and found the girl lying on her side,
  haggard and white, with a queer little smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"Doctor, darling," said Fay, "send that gaunt female out of hearing and
  I'll tell you something."</p>

  <p>Sylvia dismissed the nurse.</p>

  <p>"Bend down as they do in books," whispered the girl, with a little laugh
  that ended in a grimace, "and I will tell you my guilty secret."</p>

  <p>"What is wrong, dear?" asked Sylvia.</p>

  <p>She was in a panic&mdash;an unreasonable, fearful panic&mdash;and there
  was need to exercise control, lest her voice betrayed her. The girl's bright
  eyes were fixed on hers, and there was elfish laughter struggling with the
  pain in her voice.</p>

  <p>"If we could have a little slow music," she whispered, "I think it would
  be appropriate. Sylvia, you won't let that raw-boned creature weep over me,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Fay, be quiet," said Sylvia hoarsely. "What are you
  talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to glory," said the girl. "I sort of know it."</p>

  <p>"Let me see."</p>

  <p>Sylvia's hand trembled as she examined the spine. The tiny swelling which
  it had been her daily care to reduce had grown ominously, and there were
  other certain symptoms which could not be ignored.</p>

  <p>Jonas Picton, called from a board meeting, came back to the house and
  listened in silence whilst Sylvia told the new development.</p>

  <p>He seemed to shrink visibly at the telling, and when he spoke his voice
  was husky.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I had a lot of confidence in you, doctor," he said. "Do you
  think&mdash;do you think there is anything to be done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sylvia was silent for a while. But he might have foretold her answer in
  the sudden stiffening of her body and the upward throw of her chin.</p>

  <p>"I still have faith in my treatment," she said.</p>

  <p>He did not speak again, but sat on the edge of his chair, his head bent
  forward, his fingers twining, and then without a word he rose and went up to
  the girl's room.</p>

  <p>Sylvia did not follow him. Somehow she knew instinctively that he wished
  to go alone. She waited for ten minutes and then he came back. He did not
  look at her, but walked to the window and stared out. Presently he
  turned.</p>

  <p>"Who is the best surgeon in this country?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"John Wintermere of Mercer's Hospital," she replied.</p>

  <p>He nodded and went out of the room. Then he came back and opened the door
  wide, but he did not come into the room, nor did he look at her.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go up and see Fay," he said. "I've telephoned to Dr.
  Wintermere, and he will be here this evening."</p>

  <p>Sylvia Crest walked heavily up the stairs. She had heard the doom of her
  professional career, as though it were pronounced by a judge.</p>

  <p>Fay lay with her face turned to the door, and as the girl entered she
  beckoned her.</p>

  <p>"I had to do it, Sylvia darling," she said. "You don't mind me taking
  liberties with my staid old family doctor?"</p>

  <p>She took the older girl's hand between hers and fondled it.</p>

  <p>"Had to do what, dear?" asked Sylvia quietly.</p>

  <p>"I had to tell him to send for Wintermere."</p>

  <p>"You told him?" said Sylvia in surprise.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"You see, I've been thinking things out, and it occurred to me that I
  might be the fifth case in history, and really, for poor Daddy's sake, I
  ought to take a chance. You don't mind, do you, not really?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia stooped and kissed the girl.</p>

  <p>"No, dear," she said.</p>

  <p>"It means a tremendous lot to you, in your profession, doesn't it, I mean
  your&mdash;your&mdash;" Fay checked the words.</p>

  <p>"My mistaken diagnosis," finished Sylvia, with a laugh. "Yes, I suppose it
  does, but it means more to me that you should have the best treatment,
  irrespective of my fine feelings, and even though the treatment is contrary
  to my idea of what is right."</p>

  <p>Sylvia waited at the house the whole of that afternoon, and she was alone
  in the drawing-room when John Wintermere came. She had nerved herself for the
  meeting, and was in consequence more cold and more formal in her attitude
  than she intended.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly across the room to her, and it seemed as though the
  passage of six years had made no alteration in the disparity of their
  relationships. He was still the professor, she was still the student, though
  she felt she had grown older at a faster rate than he. But he was also the
  man who had held her hand one sunny day in the hospital gardens and had
  spoken incoherently of love, urging her to drop the profession to which she
  had dedicated her life. Perhaps the memory of this added to the awkwardness
  of the meeting.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you again, Sylvia," he said in that soft voice of his.
  "It is curious I should be called into a case of yours. Won't you tell me
  about it?"</p>

  <p>She did not resent the "Sylvia." It came so naturally and rightly, and, in
  the detailing of Fay Picton's case, her nervousness wore off. He listened
  gravely, interjecting now and again a question, and when she had finished he
  heaved a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"It may be what you think," he said, "but it seems to me that the symptoms
  suggest a series of complications. Have you"&mdash;he hesitated
  again&mdash;"have you offered a definite opinion?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Picton that the case would yield to your treatment?"</p>

  <p>She nodded again, and his face lengthened.</p>

  <p>"So if the opinion I give is in contradiction to yours...?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If that is the case," she said, "I shall regret not having followed the
  advice you offered to me six years ago."</p>

  <p>He was looking at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It would mean ruin for you, of course," he said. "I&mdash;I wish I had
  not been called in."</p>

  <p>"That's absurd, Dr. Wintermere," she said sharply. "Personal friendship
  and that sort of thing&mdash;I don't mean friendship," she went on confused,
  "I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," said Wintermere. "Will you take me up to the
  child?"</p>

  <p>Jonas Picton was in the room when they went in, and he remained by one of
  the windows whilst the examination was in progress. After a while Wintermere
  rearranged the bedclothes.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Fay, looking up into his face, with a smile; "to be or not to
  be?"</p>

  <p>He smiled back at her and gently twigged the end of her nose.</p>

  <p>"That is the privilege of an eminent specialist," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"To be or not to be?" persisted the girl.</p>

  <p>"Fay, Fay, don't talk about such things." It was her father who had come
  to her bedside and had taken her little hand in his. "Don't talk about things
  so flippantly, darling. You hurt your old Dad."</p>

  <p>Then with sudden resolution he looked across the bed to Wintermere, and
  asked harshly:</p>

  <p>"Is an operation necessary?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia held her breath. Her heart was pounding violently, and she felt as
  though she were going to faint. What would the verdict be? She knew too well
  what sentence would follow that verdict. She met the grave, earnest eyes of
  John Wintermere, and there was in hers a momentary plea for mercy. She hated
  herself for it. She knew that deep in her woman's heart was only one
  desire&mdash;the health and the life of the frail child who was looking with
  a quizzical smile from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Picton. "Is an operation necessary?"</p>

  <p>Wintermere cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"An operation is not only necessary but imperative," he said steadily,
  "and it must be performed at once."</p>

  <p>Picton, with a groan, turned on his heel and walked from the room.</p>

  <p>Sylvia saw the doctor only once again before the operation. At the request
  of the girl she was staying in the house. Picton had retired to his library
  and was not visible, and the girl was left alone in the big, cheerless
  drawing-room to plan her new future. She would have offered to help had
  Wintermere given her any encouragement, but he had (purposely, it seemed)
  made her attendance unnecessary by telephoning for an anæsthetist. So Sylvia
  sat and thought. She told herself a dozen times that every doctor makes a
  mistake, and the fact that their diagnoses were occasionally refuted does not
  ruin their career.</p>

  <p>But it was not what the world might think of Sylvia Crest that worried her
  and that drove her to a condition of blank despair. It was the shattering of
  her own faith in Sylvia Crest.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock that night she went up to see the child and found her
  cheerful&mdash;even gay.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia, my duck, sit down here," said Fay Picton, patting the side of the
  bed with her white hand, "and don't worry, because I'm going to be the
  miraculous fifth. I like your Dr. Wintermere."</p>

  <p>"My Dr. Wintermere?" The protest was forced from Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Your Dr. Wintermere," said the girl coolly. "He's awfully good-looking,
  isn't he, and not so very old. I should hate having a man with whiskers
  carving me about. And he's fond of you. I saw him looking at you like the
  film hero looks at the poor but honest shop-girl. He devoured
  you&mdash;that's the word, my dear."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense, please, Fay. You ought to be preparing
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"For a happier life," the patient laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Now go down and see father, and tell him that I am brave but happy."</p>

  <p>She had left the room, and was at the head of the stairs when she met
  Wintermere. They stopped, facing one another on the landing, and it was
  Sylvia who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"I hope it is going to be very successful, doctor," she said.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he replied drearily. "God knows, this is the most awful end
  to six years of dreaming that could be imagined. Anybody but you&mdash;if it
  had been anybody but you, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"If I am wrong, I am terribly wrong," she said. "If you are right, I shall
  thank God for it all my days."</p>

  <p>He bowed his head for a second and walked past her.</p>

  <p>To Sylvia's surprise she found Picton waiting for her in the drawing-
  room. And he was calmer and more friendly than she had expected. She
  delivered her message in a modified form, and he nodded and turned the
  conversation to a more general subject. So they talked for half an hour on
  matters which did not interest them, and their hearts and minds were in the
  room above.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly the old man turned the conversation to Sylvia herself.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," he said, "I know you did your best for my little girl, and
  you've done all you could to make her happy&mdash;to make me happy too," he
  added, then paused as though he was in some doubt as to how he should
  proceed. "What I mean is this," he said, with an effort&mdash;"that whatever
  is the outcome of this," he waved his hand to the door, "I do not blame
  you."</p>

  <p>"I shall not need your blame," said Sylvia in a low tone; "if I am wrong,
  I shall never practice again."</p>

  <p>"You'll never practice again," he repeated. "Then this is a tragedy for
  both of us."</p>

  <p>She bent her head. The handle of the door turned, and both sprang up as
  John Wintermere came in. He wore a long white wrapper, and had evidently come
  straight from his task. His face was white and drawn, and he looked from one
  to the other in silence as he closed the door behind him. Picton was shaking
  in every limb.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well?" he asked in a curiously squeaky voice.</p>

  <p>John Wintermere nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter will recover," he said, "and, I believe, will be a strong
  and healthy girl."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" gasped the old man, and falling into his chair, he
  covered his face with his hands, his shoulders shaking.</p>

  <p>"I want to say something else, please."</p>

  <p>Picton lifted his tear-stained face to the man in the white wrapper, but
  John Wintermere was looking at Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"I want to say this," he said, "that when the operation was well advanced
  I discovered that it was unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"Unnecessary!" cried Sylvia.</p>

  <p>And again he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," he said, speaking slowly, "that had Dr. Crest's
  treatment been continued, your daughter would have made a complete recovery
  without recourse to the knife."</p>

  <p>Then he walked from the room without another word.</p>

  <p>It was the anæsthetist whom Sylvia saw just before he left the house that
  night, and she talked to him as doctor to doctor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's a wonderful chap, Wintermere," said that medico, with a sigh of
  admiration and envy. "She'll recover all right. Yes, he's a wonderful fellow.
  Good-night, doctor." She smiled to herself in the darkness of the porch
  before the house.</p>

  <p>Wintermere was saying good-night to Picton, who was almost hysterical in
  his relief and happiness. When he came out, Sylvia was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Send your car on," she said; "I want to walk a little way with you."</p>

  <p>It was a slow and a silent walk, and when the time for parting came,
  Sylvia turned to the man at her side and laid her hands on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"John," she said, "I'm going out of this profession."</p>

  <p>"You're mad," he said, and his voice trembled. "You&mdash;you were right
  in this case."</p>

  <p>She laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"You dear liar," she said, and kissed him.</p>

  <h2><a name="story09"
     id="story09">9. THE CHRISTMAS PRINCESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were times when John Bennett Watson (abbreviated for
  office purposes to "J.B.") wished he were not the Managing Director of the
  Western Commercial Corporation; moments when he envied the manager of the
  Broad Street branch of the Southern &amp; Eastern Bank. This in spite of the
  fact that he was a normal man of thirty-something, without any business
  worries whatever, enjoying the best of health and an income which, at a
  moderate estimate, was twenty times larger than the hard-worked bank
  manager.</p>

  <p>J.B. was a man who in no circumstances interfered in other people's
  affairs; meddlers, he loathed; outside folks who knew how things could be
  done better, he abominated, and yet there were certain domestic arrangements
  of the Southern Bank that he would alter.</p>

  <p>Gray, the manager, a harassed little man with a straggling beard, came
  over to see him about a draft, and John made an awkward dive to the matter
  that at once intrigued and irritated him.</p>

  <p>"You are very busy at the bank, Mr. Gray?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," sighed Gray, rising and gathering up his documents, "too busy! With
  the annual audit coming on, the slump in industrials, the heavy cash balances
  I must carry to meet end-of-the-quarter demands, I look like having a happy
  New Year! Good morning!"</p>

  <p>"I was working late in my office the other night," said John hastily,
  arresting the official's departure, "and, looking across the road, I saw a
  girl working at eleven o'clock&mdash;she was still working when I left, and
  the next morning I saw her at her desk when I arrived."</p>

  <p>The manager scratched his beard.</p>

  <p>"Who can that be, now?" he asked absently. "Oh yes, that is Miss Welford.
  She was secretary to our late accountant. Poor fellow! He died leaving things
  in a terrible muddle, and if it wasn't for the fact that she has an instinct
  for banking and has got his department work at her finger-tips, I should be
  in a fearful muddle. She is the only member of my staff that I would leave on
  the premises by herself, I assure you!"</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd met her somewhere," said John carelessly and most
  untruthfully.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said the bank manager. "She is the sort of girl who has
  moved in a very good set. Her father lost his money in the rubber slump. By
  the way, rubber is a market that looks like reviving, Mr. Watson."</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said John, to whom the fluctuations of the rubber market
  meant less than nothing. "I think I remember her&mdash;<i>Annie</i> Welford,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The manager shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;'F. G.,' her initials are." He frowned. "I never
  trouble about the names of people. Oh yes, it's Frances; that's the name.
  I've often thought she's quite a good-looking girl."</p>

  <p>"You've often thought that, have you?" said John scornfully.</p>

  <p>The man was scarcely human, and yet he was loath to let him go, and
  searched around in his mind for some excuse for detaining him.</p>

  <p>"Where do you go for Christmas, Mr. Gray?"</p>

  <p>"Home," said the other, showing the first sign of animation. "The two days
  in the year I look forward to are Good Friday and Christmas Day. Christmas is
  the one day I can't work and can be really a perfectly happy man! I sit in
  front of a fire, and my children read to me or tell me Christmas stories, and
  that's my idea of a perfectly happy day."</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" said John, aghast. "You <i>are</i> human, after all!
  Though I confess that, if anybody tried to tell me a Christmas story on
  Christmas Day, I should go and look for a hatchet. And your staff&mdash;do
  they work?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to say that headquarters won't allow that," said the manager
  regretfully. "It would add to my enjoyment considerably if I knew that
  somebody else was working."</p>

  <p>John took an instant dislike to him, had thoughts of changing his
  bank.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me you would let her&mdash;them, I mean&mdash;work on
  Christmas Day? Why, it would be disgraceful!" he said hotly.</p>

  <p>When the bank manager had gone, John strode over the carpeted floor of his
  office and stood, staring across at the trim figure visible&mdash;more
  visible than he had hoped&mdash;from the window.</p>

  <p>"Quite a good-looking girl!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at the impertinence of the man. She was beautiful, the complete
  satisfaction of all his uncatalogued requirements. If he could only hear her
  speak! He shrank from the possibility of disillusionment. What would she do
  on Christmas Day? he wondered. Hold revel in her suburban home, possibly in
  the company of her sweetheart. He made a little grimace at the thought.</p>

  <p>Yet it was perfectly ridiculous to suppose that such a girl would be
  without admirers, and that from their hosts she should not have given
  preference to one over all the rest.</p>

  <p>If Gray had been just a little more human, it would have been possible to
  secure an introduction, though he shrank even from that prospect.</p>

  <p>He was staring at her when the girl looked up, saw his dim figure behind
  the window-pane, and, as though conscious that she had been the object of his
  scrutiny, got up quickly from the table, switched on the light, and pulled
  down the shade. It was the first time she had ever noticed him, he reflected
  glumly, and it was not very pleasing that her acknowledgment of his
  admiration should be so emphatically resentful.</p>

  <p>John Watson went back to his bachelor flat in St. James's with a feeling
  that the day had not been well spent, and that something in this one-sided
  intimacy had gone out of his life. He could no longer picture himself
  speaking to her, could weave no more dreams in which she played a complacent
  and agreeable part. Drawing the blind seemed to shut out even the visions
  that a pipe and a fire and a sprawling terrier bring to the most
  unimaginative. He must needs fall back upon the Princess.</p>

  <p>Her Serene Highness had been a figure of speculation from the day when old
  Nurse Crawley, who attended his infant needs, and was locally credited with
  being possessed of the devil, predicted that he would inherit a great fortune
  and marry a princess&mdash;a faith from which she never wavered all the days
  of her life. Fortune had come unexpectedly and vastly, and had been doubled
  and trebled by his own peculiar genius. But the Princess remained amongst the
  glowing and shadowy shapes of the fire, less tangible than the blue smoke
  that curled from his pipe.</p>

  <p>And now the Princess bored him. He wanted to meet "F. G. Welford." He
  wanted badly to meet her: first, to apologize for his rudeness, and then to
  ask her... well, just to ask her if life held any greater attraction than the
  balancing of a late accountant's books.</p>

  <p>The blind was drawn the next morning when he looked out. It was drawn on
  the morning of Christmas Eve. He had brought his bag to the office and lost
  two trains in the hope that she might relent. She was inexorable. He always
  traveled to Tatterdown by train because the cottage (it had been his father's
  before him) had no accommodation for a car, and somehow his big limousine did
  not attune with the atmosphere of that faded and fragrant place.</p>

  <p>The taxi-cab that took him to the station was half-way up Broad Street
  when he saw her. She was walking toward the office; had evidently been out to
  tea; and his cab was near enough to the sidewalk to give him the nearest view
  of her face he had yet had. He drew his breath at the sight of her, and for a
  second was seized with an insane desire to stop the cab, get out, and, on
  some desperate excuse or other, speak to her. But before he could commit that
  folly, she was gone.</p>

  <p>Gray was a slave-driver, he decided, a sweater, a man of no sensibility or
  feeling. Christmas Eve! And to allow a girl to work.... Perhaps the cunning
  devil had lied to him, and she was working on Christmas Day. He hated the
  unhappy Mr. Gray, hated his baldness, his beard, and all that was of him.
  Such a man had no soul, no proper appreciation of values. He was a
  cold-blooded exploiter of all that was best and noblest in humanity.</p>

  <p>By the time he had reached Bullham Junction, John Bennett Watson was
  better balanced in mind, could chuckle at his own extravagances without
  wondering at them, which was ominous.</p>

  <p>There was no conveyance at the station, and he walked through the one
  street of Bullham to the Red Lion.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Watson."</p>

  <p>He turned, to see the rubicund countenance and the blue coat of a
  policeman.</p>

  <p>"Happy Christmas, Mr. Watson. You going out to Tatterdown?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, sergeant, as soon as I can get a cab."</p>

  <p>"Likely you'll see my dog Mowser round about the village; he's a rare
  fellow for Tatterdown. There's a dog there he's always fighting. Will you
  send him home with a flea in his ear? Give him a whack and he'll go. Getting
  into bad habits, that dog. Comes home in the middle of the night and
  scratches the door till I let him in."</p>

  <p>J.B. smiled and promised.</p>

  <p>Mowser, a bedraggled wire-haired terrier, he found literally on the
  doorstep of the cottage, and Mowser's feud had evidently found expression in
  violence, for he was slightly tattered.</p>

  <p>John took him in and fed him. The hour was late, and he decided to send
  him back in the morning&mdash;an arrangement wholly agreeable to Mowser, who
  finished his scrap and went to sleep under the kitchen table.</p>

  <p>So small was Tatterdown Cottage that the man and his wife who acted as
  caretakers had no accommodation and slept at the village&mdash;a risky
  proceeding, as an insurance company had told him, but one which he preferred,
  for there were memories about this little house with its thatched roof and
  Elizabethan chimneys which were very pleasant, and the presence of strangers
  was insufferable. Here, for ten years, John Watson had wakened to hail the
  Christmas morn and listen to the silvery bells of the parish church, and had
  spent the morning in the sheltered garden, tending those hardy plants that
  reveal their treasures in bleak December. For ten Christmas Eves he had sat,
  huddled up in the big, chintz-covered chair, with a pipe and a book and his
  pleasant thoughts, listening to the drip of rain or the thin whine of the
  wind, or watching, on one never-to-be-forgotten Christmas Eve, the snowflakes
  building white cobwebs in the corner of every pane.</p>

  <p>It was half-past eleven, and he had risen with a yawn to stretch himself
  preparatory to going upstairs to bed, when there came to him from outside a
  sound which was familiar. He passed down the little passage, unbolted the
  front door, and stepped into the garden.</p>

  <p>Out of the darkness came the peculiar and distinctive sound of an
  aeroplane's engines that were not running sweetly, and presently, peering
  overhead, he saw the shadow of great wings. Suddenly a blinding white light
  showed in the skies, illuminating fields and road, so brilliant that
  Tatterdown Parish Church, a mile away, was visible. The light swooped in a
  circle, coming lower and lower, and finally vanished behind the privet fence
  of the Hermitage field, its radiance throwing the trim boundary hedge into
  silhouette.</p>

  <p>Going back into the cottage for his coat, Watson ran through the garden,
  across the road, and, vaulting the gate, stumbled over the frozen plough-land
  to the place where the landing lights of the big machine were flickering to
  extinction.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" called a voice, and John answered the hail, and presently came up
  with the two men who were standing by the under-carriage. One was lighting a
  cigarette, and the newcomer caught a momentary glimpse of his face, long,
  white, and blackly bearded. The other he could not see, but it was he who
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Tatterdown, six miles from Pelworth," Watson answered. "You got down
  without accident?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply for a few seconds, and then the bearded man laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"We got down, but not without accident," he said, a dry note in his voice.
  "Is there a house where...."</p>

  <p>Here he stopped and said something to his companion in an undertone. The
  short man grunted an inquiry in the same tone, and:</p>

  <p>"I'll ask," he said. "Are we near to a village?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not nearer than a mile," said Watson. "I have a cottage, but it
  is rather isolated."</p>

  <p>"Wife and family?"</p>

  <p>John laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"No," he said; "I am all alone."</p>

  <p>Again the whispered colloquy.</p>

  <p>"It may sound a little&mdash;unusual and impertinent, these questions,"
  said the tall man at last, "but we have a passenger who, for State reasons,
  is traveling incognito. I must take you this much into my confidence and tell
  you that she ought not to be within a thousand miles of England. May I
  therefore rely upon your discretion?"</p>

  <p>Dumbfounded, John Watson listened, his sense of adventure piqued.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you may rely upon me," he said. "I am a bachelor and live
  alone&mdash;I usually come to Tatterdown to spend Christmas&mdash;and I
  haven't even a servant in the house. I was born here, and have a certain
  sentimental feeling towards the place. I am giving you confidence for
  confidence. My name is Watson, by the way."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the other simply. "My name is James&mdash;Colonel Alfred
  James."</p>

  <p>He walked towards the machine, and John heard him speak.</p>

  <p>"You may descend, Highness," he said.</p>

  <p>His eyes now accustomed to the darkness, J.B. saw a slim figure descend,
  and waited whilst the two men and the woman spoke together in a whisper. So
  far as he could gather, the lady said little, but the conversation continued
  for so long that John began to feel the cold.</p>

  <p>"Will you come this way?" he called.</p>

  <p>"Lead on," said the gruff voice of the smaller man, and the owner of
  Tatterdown Cottage led the way to the gate, and, after some delay, opened it
  and ushered them across the road into the cottage.</p>

  <p>The tall Colonel James followed, carrying two heavy bags; then came the
  girl; and thirdly, the shorter of the two, a round, red-faced man with a
  slight moustache and a pair of small eyes that were set a trifle too close
  together.</p>

  <p>The big man deposited the bags on the floor of the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"I present you, Mr. Watson, to Her Serene Highness, Princess Marie of
  Thurgen," he said. "Her Highness has a very dear friend in London, but owing
  to the War and the restrictions which have been placed upon Germans visiting
  England, it has been necessary for Her Highness to make a surreptitious and
  in some ways unauthorized trip to London. Whilst we realize that to land in
  England without a passport and without the necessary authority from the Home
  Office constitutes a technical offense, my friend and I have gladly
  undertaken the risk to serve one to whose father we are under a heavy debt of
  obligation."</p>

  <p>All the time he had been speaking, John's wondering gaze had never left
  the girl's pale face. She stood with eyes downcast, hands lightly clasped in
  front of her, and only once during the interview did she look up. Presently
  John found his voice, though he spoke with extraordinary difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I shall be happy to place my room at the disposal of Her Highness," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"You have no telephone here?" asked the little man suddenly.</p>

  <p>John shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, with a half-smile, "we have nothing quite so modern at
  Tatterdown Cottage except a very modern bathroom leading from my room. May I
  show Your Highness the way?"</p>

  <p>The tall man inclined his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"Will you go first, please?" he said.</p>

  <p>Lighting a candle, John went up the narrow stairs, opened the door of his
  chamber, a cozy room with its old four-poster and its log fire smouldering in
  the grate.</p>

  <p>"This will do very well," said the tall man, who had followed him. "In
  here, Your Highness."</p>

  <p>He put his hand on the girl's arm and led her into the room. Then, coming
  out quickly, he closed the door behind him. At the foot of the stairs stood
  the little fat man, grotesquely huge in his leather coat and as grotesquely
  ridiculous in his leather headgear.</p>

  <p>"Her Highness is comfortable," said the bearded man. "You can go to work
  on the machine. Do you think you can get it right by the morning?"</p>

  <p>"I ought to have it right in two hours," said the other, "but we couldn't
  possibly take off in the dark. I don't know the size of the field. It's
  plough-land, too, and that'll make it a bit more difficult, but I'll
  certainly be ready for you at daybreak."</p>

  <p>With that he was gone, leaving John alone with the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Will you come into the sitting-room?" asked John.</p>

  <p>"I think not," replied James. "You see, Mr. Watson, my responsibility is a
  great one. Certain things have happened in London which have reduced Her
  Highness to the verge of despair. She has enemies&mdash;personal enemies, you
  understand?&mdash;who would not hesitate to take her life."</p>

  <p>He pulled up his leather coat, and from his pocket slipped out a
  long-barrelled Browning and snapped back the jacket.</p>

  <p>"I will not detain you any longer, Mr. Watson. You may go to bed with the
  full assurance that you have rendered an inestimable service to what was once
  the greatest ruling house in Germany."</p>

  <p>John laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," he said, "I have no bed, and if you mean that you are
  going to sit up all night, you have relieved me of a great embarrassment, for
  I should have had no place to offer you but the settee in my sitting-room.
  You are welcome to that."</p>

  <p>James shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I will remain here," he said, and sat on the lower stair. Suddenly he got
  up. "Is your sitting-room beneath your bedroom?"</p>

  <p>John nodded.</p>

  <p>"Should I hear any&mdash;any noise above?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," said John. "Every floor in this old house creaks."</p>

  <p>"Then I will join you. It is inclined to be draughty here."</p>

  <p>He accompanied his host into the sitting-room and stripped the leather
  coat he was wearing, pulled off his helmet, and sank, with a luxurious sigh,
  into the deep arm-chair that John had vacated when the sound of the
  aeroplane's engines had come to his ears.</p>

  <p>"Christmas Eve, eh?" said the colonel. He extracted a cigarette from the
  case and tapped it thoughtfully on his thumbnail. Then, seeing John's eyes
  resting on the pistol that lay on the table by his elbow, he asked: "Looks a
  little theatrical, don't you think? I suppose firearms are not in your line,
  Mr. Watson?"</p>

  <p>"I have an automatic at my London flat," said John, with a smile, "but I
  can't say that I get a great deal of pistol practice. Do you seriously mean
  that you would use that in certain extremities?"</p>

  <p>The big man blew a cloud of smoke to the ceiling and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I mean that," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"How fascinating!" said J.B. "And how un-Christmaslike!"</p>

  <p>The other smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"There are one or two things about you that puzzle me," J.B. went on
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Such as&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he hesitated, "did the Princess come to where the aeroplane was? I
  presume it was somewhere outside of London?"</p>

  <p>"We picked her up in a car," said the other shortly.</p>

  <p>"I see," said J.B. "How queer!"</p>

  <p>"What is queer?" frowned James.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing," said J.B. Watson. "You can't say that it is a usual
  experience for a bachelor to have a princess drop on to him from the clouds.
  And, for a reason which you won't want me to explain, I am especially
  interested in princesses. It goes back to a very old prophecy that was made
  by my nurse."</p>

  <p>There was a slight movement above their heads.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said James, and, rising quickly, ran up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The sound of a low-voiced conversation floated down to John Watson, and,
  after a while, the footsteps of James upon the stairs. When he came in he was
  looking a little worried.</p>

  <p>"Did Her Highness require anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing." This time the man's voice was curt. "She wanted to know when
  the machine would be ready, that is all."</p>

  <p>They sat in complete silence for half an hour till John rose.</p>

  <p>"I'll make some coffee, or I shall go to sleep. And you would like some
  coffee too?"</p>

  <p>James hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I should. I'll come with you and see you make it," he
  said.</p>

  <p>A sleeping Mowser lifted his wiry head inquiringly as the two men came
  into the kitchen, and watched them with unconcern, till, realizing that
  nothing in the shape of food was imminent, he tucked his head between his
  paws and went to sleep again.</p>

  <p>James took a chair and watched the percolator working without comment, and
  J.B. could not escape a feeling that he stood in relationship to the man as a
  convict stands to a prison guard, and this impression was strengthened when,
  the coffee made, his guest walked behind him to the sitting-room again. It
  was some time before the steaming cups had cooled sufficiently to drink, and
  John took a sip and made a wry face.</p>

  <p>"Do you take sugar?" he asked. "Because I do."</p>

  <p>He went back to the kitchen, but this time the man did not accompany him.
  But he was standing in the doorway when J.B. returned.</p>

  <p>"You took some time to find it," he said gruffly, and saw that his tone
  was a mistake, for he went on, with a laugh and a return to his old suavity:
  "Forgive my infernal cheek, but this little adventure of ours has got on my
  nerves."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't find it," said John. "My caretaker discovers a new place to
  hide her stores every visit I make to the cottage."</p>

  <p>He dropped two lumps into his coffee and stirred it, and, finding that the
  bearded colonel desired to do nothing more than to smoke an endless chain of
  cigarettes, he took down a book from the shelf and began to read.</p>

  <p>Presently the heavy boots of the smaller man sounded on the paved pathway
  outside the cottage, and John jumped up.</p>

  <p>"That must be your friend," he said, and went to admit him.</p>

  <p>The pilot, for such he seemed to be, came in, grimy of face and black of
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I've put it right," he said. "You can be ready to move as soon as you
  like. I have explored the field, and there's plenty of room to take her
  off."</p>

  <p>"Go back to the machine and stand by," said the other sharply. And then,
  to John: "I am extremely obliged to you for courtesy, and I'm glad we have
  not had to trespass longer on your hospitality than was necessary. And may I
  add the thanks of the Princess to mine?"</p>

  <p>"You may," said John.</p>

  <p>James ran up the stairs and knocked at the bedroom door.</p>

  <p>"I am ready, Your Highness."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then the key was turned and the door opened. It
  closed again upon the man, and all that John Watson could hear was the murmur
  of voices through the ceiling.</p>

  <p>He laughed softly, pure joy in every note. So old Nurse Crawley had been
  right, after all, and a princess had come into his life, and the prophecy
  might yet be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>The door was opened, two pairs of feet descended the stairs, and presently
  James stood in the light of the table-lamp, which flowed through the open
  door of the sitting-room into the passage. In each hand he carried a bag, and
  behind him was a muffled figure in a fur coat, who kept her face steadily
  averted from John's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I thank you again, Mr. Watson. If I have put you to any
  expense&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said John politely.</p>

  <p>He stood with his back to the fire and watched. He heard James put down
  his bag and turn the handle of the door, but it did not move. He tried again,
  feeling for the bolts, and finding that the door was of stout oak and the
  lock of ancient solidity, he came back to the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"I can't open your door, Mr. Watson."</p>

  <p>"Very true," said John pleasantly, "very true!"</p>

  <p>The man's brows gathered in a frown of suspicion.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;very true?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"You can't open it because I've locked it, and the key is in my pocket,"
  said John.</p>

  <p>Instantly the automatic appeared in James's hand.</p>

  <p>"Give me that key," he said coldly, "or there'll be a village tragedy that
  will mystify the reporters. I ought to have shot you anyway," he said, "and,
  by God, if you don't&mdash;give me that key!"</p>

  <p>John shook his head. His hands were still behind him, and, with a
  smothered exclamation of rage, the man pressed the trigger. There was a dull
  click.</p>

  <p>"I took the precaution of unloading your pistol when you went upstairs an
  hour or two ago, Mr. James, or Colonel James, as the case may be," said John
  in his conversational tone. "I have also sent, attached&mdash;via the back
  door&mdash;to the collar of a small and intelligent dog, an urgent message to
  the Bullham police to put in as early an appearance as possible. I've been
  expecting them for the last five minutes."</p>

  <p>With a roar of rage the big man sprang at him, and, as he did so, John
  withdrew his right hand and struck at his assailant with the poker, which it
  had held throughout the interview. Quick as a cat, the man dodged the blow,
  and in another instant he had gripped the other in his powerful hand. John
  wrenched his left arm free and struck twice at the man, but his padded coat
  softened the blows, and it was not until a lucky blow caught Colonel James
  under the jaw that he went floundering to the ground. There was the sound of
  voices outside. John took the key from his pocket and flung it at the foot of
  the terrified girl.</p>

  <p>"Open the door, quick, Miss Welford!" he hissed, and turned to leap on his
  half-maddened adversary, who had thrown open his coat and was groping for a
  second pistol. Before it could be drawn, the room was full of people, and he
  went down under the weight of two policemen and the local blacksmith.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"This is the real miracle-play," said John. "But to make the miracle
  complete, you've got to stay here and have dinner, Miss Welford."</p>

  <p>"But what I can't understand is, how you recognized me?" asked the puzzled
  girl.</p>

  <p>"I not only know your name, but I know the whole story," said John. "You
  were working at the bank late, and these two gentlemen, who must have long
  planned the coup, broke into the vault to secure the very large sum in ready
  cash which would be on the bank premises on Christmas Eve. They then
  discovered that you were among the treasures that the bank
  contained&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I heard the noise and went down. They took me away with them in the car
  because they were afraid that I should identify them. I had no idea that,
  when the machine came down, they swore that, if I betrayed them, they would
  not only kill me but kill you also. They had to explain me, so I became a
  princess. But how <i>did</i> you know that I was not?"</p>

  <p>"I knew you were a princess all right," said John. "I've known you were a
  princess ever since I started peeping into your palace window."</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, were <i>you</i> the man?" she said. "I've often wondered since. I
  never knew you."</p>

  <p>"You know me now, and you will know me much better. Will you stay and have
  Christmas dinner with me?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him quickly, then dropped her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think I will," she said. "I owe you so much, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On Christmas Day," he interrupted, "I am 'John,' even to my enemies," and
  she smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel like an enemy," she said.</p>

  <h2><a name="story10"
     id="story10">10. FINDINGS ARE KEEPINGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Findings are keepings. That was a favorite saying of Laurie
  Whittaker&mdash;a slogan of Stinie Whittaker (who had other names), her
  father.</p>

  <p>Laurie and a youthful messenger of the Eastern Telegraph Company arrived
  simultaneously on the doorstep of 704 Coram Street, Bloomsbury, and their
  arrival was coincident with the absence, in the little courtyard at the back
  of the house, of the one domestic servant on duty in that boarding-house. So
  that, while the electric bell tinkled in the kitchen, the overworked domestic
  was hanging up dishcloths in the backyard.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there's nobody in," said Laurie, flashing a bright smile at
  the youth, and then saw the cablegram in his hand. "It's for Captain John
  Harrowby, isn't it?" she asked. "I'll give it to him."</p>

  <p>And the boy, who was new to his job, delivered the envelope and accepted
  her signature in his book, without a very close regard to the regulations of
  the Cable Company.</p>

  <p>Laurie slipped the envelope in her bag and pressed the bell again. This
  time the servant heard the signal and came, wiping her hands on her apron, to
  open the door.</p>

  <p>"No, miss, Captain Harrowby's out," she said, recognizing the visitor, and
  giving her the deference and respect which were due to one who lived in the
  grandest house in Bedford Square. "He's gone up to the city. Will you step in
  and wait, miss?"</p>

  <p>If Laurie felt annoyed, she did not advertise the fact. She gave her
  sweetest smile to the servant, nodded pleasantly to the pretty girl who came
  up the steps as she went down, and, re-entering her limousine, was driven
  away.</p>

  <p>"Who is the lady, Matilda?" asked the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Her?" said the girl-of-all-work. "That's Miss Whittaker&mdash;a friend of
  Mr. Harrowby's. Surely he's told you about her, Miss Bancroft?"</p>

  <p>Elsie Bancroft laughed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Harrowby and I are not on such terms that he discusses his friends
  with me, Matilda," she said, and mounted to her tiny room on the top floor,
  to turn over again more vital and pressing problems than Captain Harrowby's
  friendship.</p>

  <p>She was a stenographer in a lawyer's office, and if her stipend was not
  generous it was fair, and might have been sufficient if she were not the
  mother of a family&mdash;in a figurative sense. There was a small brother at
  school in Broadstairs, and a smaller sister at a preparatory school at
  Ramsgate, and the money which had been left by their father barely covered
  the fees of one.</p>

  <p>Two letters were propped on her mantelpiece, and she recognized their
  character with a quaking heart. She stood for a long time surveying them with
  big, grave eyes before, with a sigh, she took them down and listlessly tore
  them open. She skimmed the contents with a little grimace, and, lifting her
  typewriter from the floor, put it on to the table, unlocked a drawer, and,
  taking out a wad of paper written in a crabbed handwriting, began to type.
  She had got away from the office early to finish the spare-time work which
  often helped to pay the rent.</p>

  <p>She had been typing a quarter of an hour when there was a gentle tap at
  the door, and, in answer to her invitation, a man came a few inches into the
  room&mdash;a slim, brown-faced man of thirty, good-looking, with that
  far-away expression in his eyes which comes to men who have passed their
  lives in wide spaces.</p>

  <p>"How are you getting on?" he asked, almost apologetically.</p>

  <p>"I've done about ten pages since last night," she said. "I'm rather slow,
  but&mdash;" She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"My handwriting is dreadful, isn't it?" he said, almost humbly.</p>

  <p>"It is rather," she answered, and they both laughed. "I wish I could do it
  faster," she said. "It is as interesting as a novel."</p>

  <p>He scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is, in a way," he said cautiously, and then, with sudden
  embarrassment, "But it's perfectly true."</p>

  <p>"Of course it's true," she scoffed. "Nobody could read this report and
  think it wasn't true! What are you going to do with the manuscript when you
  have finished it?"</p>

  <p>He looked round the room aimlessly, before his eyes returned to the pretty
  face that showed above the machine.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said vaguely. "It might go into a magazine. I've
  written it out for my own satisfaction, and because it makes what seems a
  stupid folly look intelligent and excusable. Besides which, I am hoping to
  sell the property, and this account may induce some foolish person to buy a
  parcel of swamp and jungle&mdash;though I'd feel as though I were swindling a
  buyer!"</p>

  <p>She had pushed the typewritten sheets towards him, and he picked up the
  first and read:</p>

  <p>"A Report on the Alluvial Goldfields of Quimbo,"</p>

  <p>and, reading it, he sighed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the gold is there all right," he said mournfully, "though I've never
  been able to find it. I've got a concession of a hundred square
  miles&mdash;it's worth less than a hundred shillings. There isn't a railway
  within five hundred miles; the roads are impossible; and even if there was
  gold there, I don't know that I should be able to get it away. Anyway, no
  gold has been found. I have a partner still pottering away out there: I shall
  probably have his death on my conscience sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"Are you going back to Africa?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so." He hesitated. "My&mdash;my friends think I should
  settle down in England. I've made a little money by trading. Possibly I'll
  buy a farm and raise ducks."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to write a story about that," she said, and then,
  remembering, "Did the maid tell you that Miss Whittaker had called?"</p>

  <p>She saw his start, and the color deepen in the tanned face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, did she?" he asked awkwardly. "Really? No, the girl told me nothing."
  And in another minute he was running down the stairs. She did not know
  whether to be angry or amused at this sudden termination of their talk.</p>

  <p>Captain Harrowby had been an inmate of the boarding-house for three weeks,
  and she had gladly accepted the offer, that came through her landlady, to
  type what she thought was the story he had written. The "story" proved to be
  no more, at first glance, than a prosaic report upon an African property of
  his, which, he told her, he was trying to sell.</p>

  <p>Who was Miss Whittaker? She frowned as she asked herself the question,
  though she had no reason for personal interest in the smiling girl she had
  met at the door. She decided that she did not like this smart young lady,
  with her shingled hair and her ready smile. She knew that Captain Harrowby
  spent a great deal of his time at the Whittakers' house, but she had no idea
  that there was anything remarkable in that, until the next day, when she was
  taking her lunch at the office, she asked old Kilby, who knew the secret
  history of London better than most process-servers.</p>

  <p>"Whittaker?" the old man chuckled. "Oh, I know Stinie Whittaker all right!
  He runs a gambling hell in Bloomsbury somewhere. He was convicted about ten
  years ago for the same offense. I served a couple of writs on him years and
  years ago. He's more prosperous now."</p>

  <p>"But surely Miss Whittaker doesn't know?" said the shocked girl.
  "She's&mdash;she's the friend of a&mdash;a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>Old Kilby laughed uproariously.</p>

  <p>"Laurie? Why, Laurie's brought more men to the old man's table than
  anybody else! Know? Sure she does! Why, she spends all summer going voyages
  in order to pick up likely birds for Stinie to kill!"</p>

  <p>The news filled the girl with uneasiness, though she found it difficult to
  explain her interest in the lonely man who occupied the room beneath her.
  Should she warn him? At the mere suggestion she was in a panic. She had quite
  enough trouble of her own, she told herself (and here she spoke only the
  truth). And was it likely that a man of his experience would be caught by
  card-sharps? For six days she turned the matter over in her mind and came to
  a decision.</p>

  <p>On the evening she reached this, John Harrowby dressed himself with great
  care, took a roll of notes from his locked cash-box, and, after contemplating
  them thoughtfully, thrust them into his pocket. His situation was a serious
  one; more serious than he would admit to himself. Laurie had cautioned him
  against playing for high stakes, but she had not cautioned him against Bobby
  Salter, the well-dressed young man-about-town, whom he had met first in the
  Bedford Square drawing-room. Bobby had told him stories of fortunes made and
  lost at cards, and even initiated him into a "system" which he himself had
  tested, and had been at his elbow whenever he sat at the table, to urge him
  to a course of play which had invariably proved disastrous.</p>

  <p>John Harrowby was without guile. He no more thought of suspecting the
  immaculate Bobby than he thought of suspecting Laurie herself. But tonight he
  would play without the assistance of his mentor, he thought, and drew a deep
  breath as he patted his pocket and felt the bulge of the notes.</p>

  <p>He threw a light coat over his arm, and, turning off the light, stepped
  out on to the landing, to stare in amazement at a girl who was waiting
  patiently, her back to the banisters, as she had been waiting for ten
  minutes.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you before you went, Captain Harrowby," said Elsie, with
  a quickly beating heart.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong with the manuscript?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't that, only&mdash;only I'm wondering whether&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Words failed her for a second.</p>

  <p>He was palpably amazed at her agitation, and could find no reason for
  it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord," he said, remembering suddenly. "I haven't paid you!"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no, it isn't that." She pushed his hand from his pocket. "Of
  course it isn't that, Captain Harrowby! It's something&mdash;well... I know
  you'll think I'm horribly impertinent, but do you think you ought to play
  cards for money?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He stared at her open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know what you mean," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you lost... a lot of money at Mr. Whittaker's house?" She had to
  force the words out.</p>

  <p>The look in his face changed. From amazement, she saw his eyes narrow, and
  then, to her unspeakable relief, he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have lost quite a sum," he said gently. "But I don't think
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't think that's any business of mine? And neither is it," she
  said, speaking rapidly. "But I wanted to tell you that Mr. Whittaker ... is a
  well-known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here she had to stop. She could not say the man was a cheat or a thief;
  she knew no more than old Kilby had hinted.</p>

  <p>"I mean, he has always had... play at his house," she faltered. "And
  you're new to this country, and you don't know people as&mdash;as we know
  them."</p>

  <p>This time he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're talking as though you were in the detective service, Miss
  Bancroft," he said, and then suddenly laid his hand on her shoulder. "I quite
  understand that you are trying to do me a good turn. In my heart of hearts I
  believe you're right. But, unfortunately, I have lost too much to stop
  now&mdash;how you knew that I'd lost anything, I can't guess."</p>

  <p>She nodded, and, without another word, turned abruptly away and ran up the
  stairs to her own room, angry with herself, angry with him, but, more than
  anything else, astounded at her own action.</p>

  <p>No less puzzled and troubled was John Harrowby as he walked into Bedford
  Square.</p>

  <p>Elsie had some work to do; but somehow she could not keep her mind fixed
  upon her task, and, after spoiling three sheets of paper, gave up the attempt
  and, sitting back in her chair, let her mind rove at will.</p>

  <p>At half-past nine the maid brought her up a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>"That Miss Whittaker's just gone, miss," she announced.</p>

  <p>Elsie frowned.</p>

  <p>"Miss Whittaker? Has she been here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss; she come about a quarter of an hour ago and went up to Captain
  Harrowby's room. That's what puzzles me."</p>

  <p>Elsie stared at her, open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth did she go there?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>Matilda shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Blest if I can tell, miss. She didn't know that I was watching
  her&mdash;she sent me down to the kitchen to make a cup of tea for her, which
  was only a dodge of hers, and if I hadn't come back to ask her whether she
  took sugar, I wouldn't 'a' known she'd been out of the droring-room. I see
  her coming out of Captain Harrowby's room as I was standing in the hall. You
  can just see the door through the banisters."</p>

  <p>Elsie rose, and went downstairs. Harrowby's door was ajar. She switched on
  the light. What she expected to find, she did not know. There was no sign of
  disorder. Possibly, she thought, and she found herself sneering, it was a
  visit of devotion by a love-stricken lady; but there was a cupboard door
  ajar, and half in and half out the cupboard, a japanned box that was open.
  She took up the box. It was empty. She put the box back in the cupboard and
  went thoughtfully out on to the landing.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go and see Captain Harrowby," she said, obeying a sudden
  impulse, and, a few minutes later, she was walking through the rain to
  Bedford Square.</p>

  <p>She was within a dozen paces of the door of Mr. Whittaker's house when a
  cab drew up, and she saw Laurie Whittaker alight, pay the cabman and, running
  up the step, open the door of the house. Where had she been in the meantime?
  wondered Elsie. But there was no mystery here. It had begun to rain heavily
  as Laurie left the house in Coram Street, and she had sheltered in a doorway
  until a providential taxi came along.</p>

  <p>Possibly it was the rain that damped the enthusiasm of the amateur
  detective; for now, with the Whittaker house only a few paces away, she
  hesitated. And the longer she waited, the wetter she became. The taxi-man who
  had brought Laurie lingered hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Taxi, miss?" he asked, and Elsie, feeling a fool, nodded and climbed into
  the cab, glad to escape for a second from the downpour, and hating herself
  for her extravagance.</p>

  <p>The cab had turned when her hand touched something on the seat. A woman's
  vanity-bag&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Findings are keepings," according to the proverb, though there is an
  offense in law which is known as "stealing by finding."</p>

  <p>Elsie Bancroft knew little of criminal law, but she was possessed of an
  inelastic conscience, so that when her hand touched the bag in the darkness,
  her first impulse was to tap at the window of the taxi-cab and draw the
  attention of the driver to her find. And then, for some reason, she checked
  the impulse. It was a fat bag, and the flap was open. Her ungloved fingers
  stole absently into its interior, and she knew that she was touching real
  money in large quantities.</p>

  <p>During the war she had worked in a bank, and the feel of banknotes was
  familiar. Mechanically, she slipped their edge between her nimble fingers.
  One... two... three... she went on, until....</p>

  <p>"Eighty-four!"</p>

  <p>They might be five-pound notes&mdash;four hundred and twenty pounds. She
  felt momentarily giddy. Four hundred and twenty pounds! Sufficient to pay the
  children's school fees&mdash;she had had an urgent, if dignified, request
  from the principal of Tom's boarding-school and a no less pointed hint from
  Joan's&mdash;sufficient to settle the problem of the holidays; but&mdash;</p>

  <p>She heaved a deep sigh and looked through the rain-blurred windows. She
  was painfully near to her destination, and she had to make her decision. It
  came as a shock to her that any decision had to be made; her course of duty
  was plain. It was to take the number of the cab, hand the bag to the driver,
  and report her discovery to the nearest police station.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to be done, no alternative line of action for an
  honest citizen....</p>

  <p>The cab stopped with a jerk and, twisting himself in his seat, the driver
  yanked open the door.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Harrowby blinked twice at the retiring rake. A mahogany rake with a
  well-worn handle, and with an underlip of brass so truly set that even the
  flimsiest of banknotes could hardly escape its fine bevel. And there were
  banknotes aplenty on the croupier's side of that rake. They showed ends and
  corners and ordered edges, notes clean and unclean, but all having a certain
  interest to Harrowby, because, ten minutes, or maybe ten seconds before, they
  had been his, and were now the property of the man who wore his evening suit
  so awkwardly and sucked at a dead cigar.</p>

  <p>John Harrowby put his hand in his pocket; as an action it was sheerly
  mechanical. His pocket, he knew, was a rifled treasury, but he felt he must
  make sure.</p>

  <p>Then came Salter, plump, philosophical, and sympathetic. Salter could
  afford both his sympathy and philosophy; the house gave him a ten per cent
  commission on all the easy money he touted, so that even his plumpness was
  well inside his means.</p>

  <p>"Well, how did you do?"</p>

  <p>Harrowby's smile was of the slow dawning kind, starting at the corner of
  his eyes and ending with the expanse of a line of white teeth.</p>

  <p>"I lost."</p>

  <p>Salter made a noise, indicative of his annoyance.</p>

  <p>"How much?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>He gave the impression that if the loss could be replaced from his pocket,
  it would be a loss no longer. And Stinie, he of the awkwardly worn
  dinner-jacket, sometimes minimized a client's losses and based his commission
  note on his pessimistic estimate.</p>

  <p>"About two thousand pounds," said Harrowby.</p>

  <p>"Two thousand pounds," said Salter thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He <i>would</i> be able to buy the car that he had refused in the
  afternoon. He felt pleased.</p>

  <p>"Tough luck, old man&mdash;try another day."</p>

  <p>"Yes," dryly.</p>

  <p>Harrowby looked across to the table. The bank was still winning. Somebody
  said "Banco!" in a sharp, strained voice. There was a pause, a low
  consultation between the croupier and the banker, and a voice, so
  expressionless and unemotional that Harrowby knew it was the croupier's, said
  "I give."</p>

  <p>And the bank won again.</p>

  <p>Harrowby snuffled as though he found a difficulty in breathing.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly down the stairs and paused for a second outside the
  white-and-gold door of the drawing-room, where he knew Laurie would be
  sitting. A moment's hesitation, then he turned the handle and went in. She
  was cuddled up in the corner of a big settee, a cigarette between her red
  lips, a book on her lap. She looked round, and for a second searched his face
  with her hard, appraising eyes. She was a year or two older than he ... he
  had thought her divine when he came back from Central Africa, where he had
  spent five bitter years, a trader's half-breed wife and an occasional
  missionary woman, shrivelled and yellow with heat and fever, the only
  glimpses he had of womankind.</p>

  <p>But now he saw her without the rosy spectacles which he had worn.</p>

  <p>"Have you been playing?" she asked coolly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And lost?"</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Really, father is too bad," she drawled. "I wish he wouldn't allow this
  high play in the house. I hope you're not badly hurt?"</p>

  <p>"I've lost everything," he said.</p>

  <p>For a second her eyebrows lifted.</p>

  <p>"Really?" It was a polite, impersonal interest she showed, no more.
  "That's too bad."</p>

  <p>She swung her feet to the floor, straightened her dress, and threw away
  her cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall not be seeing a great deal of you in the future, Captain
  Meredith?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," he said steadily.</p>

  <p>Was this the girl he had known, who had come aboard at Madeira, who had
  made the five days' voyage from Funchal to Southampton pass in a flash? And
  now he must go back to scrape the earth, to trek into the impenetrable
  jungle, seeking the competence which he had thought was his.</p>

  <p>"I think you are damnable!" he said.</p>

  <p>For a second her brows met, then she laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, you're a fool," she said calmly. "I certainly invited you to
  come to the house, but I never asked you to gamble. And really, John, I
  thought you would take your medicine like a little gentleman."</p>

  <p>His heart was thumping painfully. Between the chagrined man whose vanity
  has been hurt, and the clean anger of one who all his life had detested
  meanness and trickery, he was in a fair way to making a fool of himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said in a low voice, and was walking out of the room when
  she called him by name.</p>

  <p>"I hate to part like this." Her voice was soft, had the old cooing caress
  in it. "You'll think I'm horrid, John, but really I did my best to persuade
  you not to play."</p>

  <p>He licked his dry lips and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us part bad friends." She held out her hand, and he took it
  automatically. "I thought we were going to have such a happy time together,"
  she went on, her pathetic eyes on his. "Can't I lend you some money?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure the luck would turn if you gave it a chance. Couldn't you sell
  something?"</p>

  <p>The cool audacity of the suggestion took his breath away.</p>

  <p>"Sell? What have I to sell?" he demanded harshly. "Souls and bodies are no
  longer negotiable, even if there was a twentieth-century Mephistopheles
  waiting round the corner to negotiate the deal!"</p>

  <p>She toyed with the fringe of a cushion.</p>

  <p>"You could sell your mine," she said, and his laugh sounded loud and
  discordant in the quietness of that daintily furnished room.</p>

  <p>"That's worth twopence-ha'penny! It is a cemetery&mdash;a cemetery of hope
  and labor. It is the real white man's grave, and I am the white man."</p>

  <p>She brought her eyes back to his.</p>

  <p>"As you won't borrow money from me, I'll buy it for a thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>Again he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm afraid there's nothing to be done," he said, "except to wish you
  good-night."</p>

  <p>As he turned, she slipped between him and the door.</p>

  <p>"I won't let you go like that, John," she said. "Won't you forgive
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I've already forgiven you, if there's anything to forgive," he said.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and write me a letter saying you forgive me. I want to have that
  tangible proof," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>He was impatient to be gone, and the foolery of the suggestion grated on
  him.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll write it," she said, sat down at the little escritoire and
  scribbled a dozen words. "Now sign that."</p>

  <p>He would have gone, but she clutched him by the sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Do, please&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>He took the pen and scrawled his name, without reading the note, which was
  half concealed by her hand. Looking through her open fingers, he saw the
  words "Quimbo Concession."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he said sharply, but she snatched the letter away.</p>

  <p>"Give me that paper!" he demanded sternly, reaching out for it, but in
  another second an automatic pistol had appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Go whilst the going's good, Harrowby," she said steadily.</p>

  <p>But she had not reckoned on this particular type of man. Suddenly his hand
  shot out and gripped her wrist, pinning it to the table. In another second he
  had snatched the letter and flung it into the little fire that blazed on the
  hearth. He held her at bay till the last scrap of blue paper had turned to
  black ashes, and then, with a little smile and a nod, he went out of the room
  into the street and the pelting rain.</p>

  <p>He was wet through as he opened the door of No. 704 Coram Street. Matilda,
  half-way up the stairs, turned with her startling news. He listened and
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"Miss Whittaker been here?" he said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir... and Miss Bancroft went to tell you all about it. Didn't you
  see her?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>What had Laurie Whittaker wanted? he asked himself, as he went up the
  stairs to his room. The girl must have been mistaken.</p>

  <p>He took one glance at the open cupboard, and then the truth leapt at him,
  and, snatching at the box, he put it on the table and threw open the lid.
  There had been a square sheet of parchment in a broad envelope, and on that
  parchment was inscribed his title to the Quimbo Concession. It was gone.</p>

  <p>He turned with an oath. A girl was standing watching him with grave
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is this what you're looking for?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Her face was very pale. She held out the envelope, and he took it from her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Where did this come from?" he said, in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I stole it," she answered simply; "and I think this is yours."</p>

  <p>He took the envelope from her hand with a frown, extracted a cable form
  and read. It was from his partner.</p>

  <p>"Gold found in large quantities near Crocodile Creek.
  Congratulations."</p>

  <p>"How did you get this?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>She held out a little French vanity-bag, and he recognized it
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"I found it in a cab; Miss Whittaker left it there," she said. "There is
  also four hundred and twenty pounds which belongs to her."</p>

  <p>"Which belong to us," said John Harrowby firmly. "Findings are keepings in
  this case, my child. She found me and kept most of my money&mdash;I've got
  fifty pounds left at the bank&mdash;and I think we're entitled to this little
  salvage from the wreck."</p>

  <p>And then he kissed her, and it seemed such a natural thing to do, that she
  offered no protest.</p>

  <h2><a name="story11"
     id="story11">11. THE LITTLE GREEN MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">An understanding, disturbed or terminated, has a more tragic
  aspect than a broken contract. For understandings are without the foundations
  of pledge and promise written or spoken.</p>

  <p>There was an understanding between Molly Linden and Thursby Grant. Neither
  was important, because they were young; they were as yet nebulæ, hoping to be
  worlds. He was poor in the sense that he could afford no more than a
  Kensington flat and the lightest of light cars; he was (Molly thought) very
  handsome and very, very nice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fathergill amused her&mdash;fascinated her by reason of his great age
  and romantic past. He was forty, and his immense riches were common
  knowledge. But that did not count with Molly. She much preferred riding in
  his smooth-running limousine to being buffeted and rattled in Thursby's
  two-seater. Mr. Fathergill's little dinners at the Ritz had a comfort which
  was not afforded by the solid restaurant where table-cloths were only changed
  when absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>Still, there was a sort of understanding. If the matter had been allowed
  to remain where Charles Fathergill left it, that warm night in June when they
  paced the scented dusky garden, Thursby Grant might have become a tender
  memory or a bitter disappointment, according to the way he accepted his
  <i>congé</i>. Unhappily, Molly's father had been a little tactless.</p>

  <p>She carried the news to him in his study; she was fluttered, a little
  tearful. One nice word about Thursby would have swung her definitely to the
  side of Charles Fathergill.</p>

  <p>Instead, Mr. Linden said:</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that, Molly! You had better write to young Grant and tell
  him he need not call again."</p>

  <p>There was no reason in the world why he should not have called again; why
  he should not have appeared with a sad, brave smile and a hearty, "Good luck,
  old girl!"</p>

  <p>But Mr. Linden had been brought up in the Victorian tradition. Then and
  there Thursby Grant was martyred for love; became a radiant figure of
  persecution. Worse, he himself accepted the martyr's rôle, and indited severe
  and haughty letters to Molly's father, to Molly's fiancé.</p>

  <p>One evening he walked fiercely down Pall Mall, entered the sublime portals
  of the Disraeli Club and, thrusting his hat at an inoffensive page-boy, was
  ushered into the smoke-room. For the greater part of an hour he sat in a sort
  of trance, listening to Mr. Charles Fathergill, who was never averse from
  talking....</p>

  <p>Just beyond Fathergill's chair was a high marble pillar of a rich red,
  broken by white spots and minute serpentines. Thursby Grant had been staring
  at that pillar for twenty minutes with a painful intensity, some place in his
  brain busy with the baffling quest for the exact part of the world where such
  marble may be quarried. <i>Rosso antico</i>&mdash;that was its technical
  description. He remembered a big house in Marlborough with a fireplace. Rosso
  antico. That was it.</p>

  <p>Behind the pillar, half concealed, was a hatchet-faced little waiter,
  whose livery hung upon him in folds. He was staring out of the window at the
  white façade of the Auto Club.</p>

  <p>A big room, rather over decorated, with red paper and dingy gildings.
  Scores of well-used, cozy chairs about round tables, where middle-aged men
  sat smoking over their coffee and told one another of the queer thing that
  happened to them, twenty?&mdash;no, it must be twenty-five&mdash;years
  ago.</p>

  <p>Rosso antico....</p>

  <p>A buzz of talk as even as an asphalt pavement lay on the club
  smoking-room. Fathergill's voice, pitched on an infinitesimally higher plane,
  rippled along its surface.</p>

  <p>All Thursby's brain which was not occupied by rosso antico was at
  Fathergill's disposition.</p>

  <p>"... hundred, two hundred years ago, quite a lot of people would have
  hired a bravo to cut me up. Possibly you would not have descended to hiring
  an assassin. A quarrel in a coffee-house, chairs to Leicester Gardens, and a
  few passes with our swords would have settled the matter.
  Satisfactory&mdash;in a way. It would depend entirely upon who was pinked.
  Now we take no risks, carry no swords, do nothing stupid, and only a few
  things that are vulgar. Slay and heal with currency; the age of reason."</p>

  <p>Fathergill's head was long and narrow. He had a dark face and black,
  abundant hair brushed back from his forehead. He affected a tiny black
  moustache, an adequate occupation for his long fingers in moments of
  abstraction. His lank body was doubled up in a low chair, and he lay back so
  that his knees were level with his chin. When he spoke he waved one hand or
  the other to emphasize a point.</p>

  <p>With the free part of his mind Thursby found himself wishing that the man
  did not wear diamond studs in his dress shirt.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to dinner tonight&mdash;you preferred to come in for coffee.
  I appreciate your feelings. You are hurt. You are saying to yourself: 'Here
  am I, a struggling engineer, who has found a nice girl who likes me'&mdash;I
  grant that&mdash;'and here is a fellow worth millions who comes along and
  cuts me out, not because he's more attractive, but because he has enough
  money to order life as he wishes it.'"</p>

  <p>"It isn't much to boast about, is it?" asked Thursby, his voice husky from
  a long, dry-mouthed silence.</p>

  <p>Charles Fathergill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am not boasting. You have suddenly found the door of a nice house on
  Wimbledon Common closed to you&mdash;or only opened as far as is necessary to
  tell you that Miss Molly Linden is not at home. All this is
  unexpected&mdash;rather staggering. Your letters are returned, your telephone
  messages not delivered. You know I am a friend of the family, and you ask me
  if I can explain. I bring you to my club, and I tell you plainly and honestly
  that I intend within the next twelve months marrying Molly Linden, that her
  father has agreed, and that she&mdash;seems reconciled. Could I be
  fairer?"</p>

  <p>Thursby drew a long breath. It almost seemed that he had suddenly awakened
  from a heavy, ugly sleep.</p>

  <p>"Money could not have been the only inducement," he said.</p>

  <p>Fathergill shrugged one shoulder, silently inserted a cigarette in the end
  of a long holder, and lit it with deliberate puffs.</p>

  <p>"The key to all power is knowledge," he said&mdash;"and ruthlessness."</p>

  <p>Throughout the interview his tone, his manner, had been most friendly. The
  wrath of this good-looking young guest, who had come with murder in his
  heart, had been blanketed under the unconscious friendliness of one whom
  Thursby Grant so little regarded as a host that he had not sipped the coffee
  that had filmed itself cold under his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I started life as a bricklayer's assistant"&mdash;Fathergill watched the
  ragged wisps of smoke dissipating with an air of enjoyment&mdash;"and at an
  early stage of my career I began to <i>know</i>. I knew that we were cheating
  the Borough Surveyor. The Borough Surveyor gave me ten shillings for my
  information. He took me into his office. He had a love affair with his
  typist. I knew&mdash;I was assistant store-keeper at eighteen."</p>

  <p>"That sounds almost like blackmail to me," frowned Thursby.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fathergill smiled slowly.</p>

  <p>"Never label things," he warned. "Know them, but never commit yourself to
  labels."</p>

  <p>"You mean you have some hold over Linden?"</p>

  <p>"Melodrama," murmured the other, closing his eyes wearily. "How terribly
  young you are! No. I know that John Linden wants to marry again. He is fifty,
  and young for fifty. A good-looking man, with an ineradicable sense of
  adventure. You would not be able to marry Molly for three years&mdash;at
  least I would marry at once; she asks for a year. Molly must have an
  establishment of her own before John Linden makes his inevitable blunder and
  brings his inevitably youthful bride to Wimbledon!"</p>

  <p>Again Thursby discovered that he was breathing heavily through his nose,
  and checked his rising anger.</p>

  <p>"I think that is about all I wanted to know," he said, and rose
  awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"You <i>know</i>: that is important," said Fathergill, and offered a
  lifeless hand.</p>

  <p>As much of this interview as he deemed necessary went forward to
  Wimbledon.</p>

  <p>John Linden, gray and red-faced, read scraps of the letter written on club
  notepaper to his daughter. Over his glasses he looked to see how she took the
  news. Her face was expressionless.</p>

  <p>"I really think that a year will make all the difference," he told
  her&mdash;and himself. "I like Thursby, but, my dear, I have to consider
  you."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes from the plate. She was not especially beautiful: she
  was distinctly pretty&mdash;the kind of cultivated-garden prettiness which
  youth brings, and good, simply cut clothes adorn.</p>

  <p>"Are you very rich, father?"</p>

  <p>She had never asked him such a question before.</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear? I'm not rich in money and not particularly rich in
  property. Why?"</p>

  <p>She looked past him through the leaded casement window.</p>

  <p>"Only... Charles never made the least suggestion that he wanted to marry
  me until he came back from Roumania."</p>

  <p>He laughed loudly at this.</p>

  <p>"What a romantic little devil you are!" he said good-humoredly. "I see how
  your queer little mind is working. Fathergill went to Roumania and discovered
  my oil property is worth a fortune; he kept the knowledge to himself and came
  back to propose to my daughter".</p>

  <p>If she had not thought this, she should not have gone scarlet. He did not
  add to her embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I should be glad to get back the money I have sunk in Roumanian oil," he
  said. "You seem to forget that I have an agent in Bukharest who keeps me
  <i>au fait</i> with all that is happening."</p>

  <p>"Thursby says you can buy any Roumanian agent for a thousand <i>lei</i>,"
  she protested, and he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget that Charles Fathergill is a millionaire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He says so. Thursby says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Linden consigned Thursby to the devil.</p>

  <p>"I really am in love with Thursby," she said haltingly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Linden said nothing. Soon after she got up from the table hurriedly.
  She was rather young.</p>

  <p>It could not be said that Charles Fathergill was well known in the City.
  The obvious is accepted without analysis: that is the deadly danger of the
  obvious. One knows that Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square is built of
  stone. Nobody knows or cares who built it or what stone was employed.
  Everybody knew that Mr. Charles Fathergill was immensely rich. He had a flat
  in Carlton House Gardens, and paid a twenty-thousand-pounds premium to secure
  it. The cabmen he tipped, the club servants, the policeman on the
  beat&mdash;who else matters?&mdash;could all testify to his wealth and
  generosity. He grew richer by being rich. When interested people inquired as
  to his stability, Stubbs pointed out the fact that he had never had a
  judgment recorded against him; his lawyers certified him as a desirable
  client or customer to any person who wished him as a client or customer; one
  of his bank managers&mdash;he employed several bankers&mdash;seconded the
  reference. There is only one peculiarity which need be mentioned&mdash;each
  of his bankers was under the impression that they were carrying his smallest
  account, and often hinted to him that they would like to carry one of his
  heavier balances.</p>

  <p>As has been remarked before, he was not known in the City, for he did not
  speculate or engage in commerce. And not being known in the City has this
  advantage, that nothing is known to your disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Mr. Linden met his prospective son-in-law at the club a few days
  later.</p>

  <p>"Going to Roumania?" Mr. Fathergill's eyes opened. "Good
  heavens!&mdash;why? I haven't been back four months."</p>

  <p>Mr. Linden tossed down a cocktail and wiped his mouth busily.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd go... may meet the girl of my dreams, eh?" A long chuckle:
  John Linden was old enough not to be ashamed of dreams.</p>

  <p>"When do you think of leaving? I am going as far as Budapest. I have some
  big interests there."</p>

  <p>A rapid calculation produced the assurance that Mr. John Linden's many
  directorships and annual general meetings would make it impossible to leave
  before another month. Charles pursed his lips thoughtfully. He must go before
  then, he said.</p>

  <p>He left London within a week.</p>

  <p>Thursby Grant was at Victoria Station saying good-bye to a friend who was
  traveling to the Near East. He acknowledged Fathergill's smiling nod without
  effort, being helped to toleration by a letter which crashed all solemn
  promises made by the writer.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Thursby's friend. "Do you know Charles Fathergill? They
  say he is a millionaire five times over."</p>

  <p>"Six times," said Thursby, suddenly sour. "Why damn his reputation for a
  million?"</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>Mr. Linden's agent in Bukharest was a lawyer, one Bolescue. He was a stout
  man, with a large, damp face, who loved food and music and baccarat.
  Otherwise he and discretion and probity might have walked hand in hand. As it
  was, he vociferated refusals, his countenance growing moister, talked wildly
  of "committees," fearfully of engineers, but never once of the majestic law,
  soon to be flaunted.</p>

  <p>Charles Fathergill had a letter of credit for many thousands of pounds.
  His French was not too good; the money spoke with the purest accent. M.
  Bolescue, with his light heart fixed upon the gambling tables at Cinta,
  agreed that certain reports might be postponed, an engineer's emphatic
  opinion suppressed, borings now in progress slowed till the coming of Mr.
  John Linden, and then suspended.</p>

  <p>"After six months' more time all subterfuges is impossibility," said M.
  Bolescue, who occasionally tried to speak good English.</p>

  <p>"After six months nothing matters," replied the lank man.</p>

  <p>His plan was to stay a fortnight in Bukharest, leaving for Constantinople
  to avoid John Linden. But a fortnight is a long time, and the joys of
  motoring in hired machines are too easily exhausted. Nor had beautiful Cinta
  in the hills, with its glorious surroundings of mountain and forest, any
  attraction for him.</p>

  <p>On the eighth night he sent for the hall porter of the Petite Splendide,
  and the official came quickly, Mr. Fathergill being a lordly dispenser of
  tips. A short man, square-shouldered, bow-legged, resplendent in gold lace,
  he came, hat in hand&mdash;would have crawled.</p>

  <p>"I'm bored, Peter," said Mr. Fathergill.</p>

  <p>His half-eaten dinner was on the table. He had scarcely touched his
  wine.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Peter, and beamed.</p>

  <p>"I want amusing: somebody who can talk or sing. God! I'm sick of
  Bukharest."</p>

  <p>He was justified, for into Bukharest seem to have seeped the dregs of
  ancient Rome&mdash;dregs that have gained a little foulness from Turk and
  Slav. A rococo Rome.</p>

  <p>"Talk... seeng... hum!"</p>

  <p>Peter's stumpy hand caressed two of his blue-black chins.</p>

  <p>"The book I can bring... some beautiful ones&mdash;no? Talk and
  seeng&mdash;ah! Gott of Gotts!"</p>

  <p>He resolved into a windmill of waving palms; noises of pride and
  exultation came from him.</p>

  <p>"One who never came to the books! New&mdash;a princess, Mr. Fat'ergill!
  No! I swear by Gott"&mdash;he put his hand on his heart and raised his eyes
  piously to the ceiling&mdash;"I would not lie. You will say, Peter says this
  of all. But a veritable princess. Russian... from&mdash;I don't
  know&mdash;the Black Sea somewhere. You say yes?" He nodded in anticipation,
  and then his face fell. "You must be rich for this princess... wait!"</p>

  <p>He rummaged in the tail pocket of his frock coat and found a packet of
  letters, fixed steel-rimmed pince-nez, and sought for something, his lips
  moving in silent speech&mdash;a comical, cherubic bawd of a man.</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;it is in French... I read. From she&mdash;to me!" He struck an
  attitude. "Irene... listen...."</p>

  <p>He read rapidly. Charles could not understand half the letter: the
  important half was intelligible.</p>

  <p>"All right; tell her to come up and have a glass of wine with me."</p>

  <p>"I shall telephone," said Peter....</p>

  <p>Ten struck when Irene came. Charles, reading a week-old <i>Times</i>,
  looked up over the newspaper at the click of the lock and saw the door
  opening slowly. She stood in the doorway, looking at him. Very slim and lithe
  and white. Her black hair dressed severely, parted in the center and framing
  her face. Clear-skinned, no art gave her aid there. The exquisite loveliness
  of her caught him by the throat. He rose instinctively, and then the faintest
  smile twitched the corner of her blood-red mouth.</p>

  <p>Regal... and Russian. Russia was in her dark eyes&mdash;the inscrutable
  mystery of the Slav... a million æons removed from Western understanding.</p>

  <p>"May I come in?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was as he had expected&mdash;rather low and rich. There was a
  sort of husky sweetness in it that made his slow pulses beat the faster. Her
  English was faultless.</p>

  <p>"May I have a cigarette?"</p>

  <p>She was at the table, looking down at him, one hand already in the silver
  box.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you?" He found his voice.</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair so that he faced her.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to sing&mdash;really? I'm afraid my voice isn't awfully
  good. Or don't you?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing... here?" His gesture embraced not only the material
  part of Bukharest, but the place she occupied in its social life.</p>

  <p>Again that faint smile.</p>

  <p>"One must live... singing and... and talking to people. I have not really
  begun my career as... an entertainer. You are my first audience. It may prove
  to be very amusing after all."</p>

  <p>"Very amusing," he repeated mechanically.</p>

  <p>"So many things have seemed&mdash;impossible." She blew ring after ring of
  smoke between her words. "So many nights I have sat on my bed and looked at
  The Little Green Man and wondered... and wondered. Then I have put The Little
  Green Man under my pillow and said: 'Let me see tomorrow&mdash;it may be
  fun.'"</p>

  <p>She was smiling at his perplexity, reached for the black velvet handbag
  that she had laid on the table, and, opening it, took out a small green
  bottle. It was fashioned like a squat Russian moujik, wearing a heavy
  overcoat belted at the waist. The hat was the stopper. As she held it up to
  the light, Fathergill saw that it was three parts filled with a fluid.</p>

  <p>"In other words, poison. That's rather theatrical, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" She was interested. "I don't know. Professor Bekinsky gave it to
  me the week before he was arrested. He was a Jew and a good man. They blew
  his brains out in front of the house where I was staying in Kieff."</p>

  <p>Charles Fathergill was chilled: this was not amusing.</p>

  <p>"Has it any special properties&mdash;arsenic... aconite...?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He called it 'knowledge'&mdash;he had a sense of humor."
  She made a wry little face at him, then laughed softly. It was one of those
  delicious chuckling laughs that are so beautiful when heard from a woman.
  "You would rather I sang?"</p>

  <p>"No... only it <i>is</i> rather depressing, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She asked him who he was. On the subject of Mr. Fathergill he could be
  eloquent. To talk of himself without exposing his theory of life was
  difficult. She listened gravely. He felt that it was impossible that she
  could be startled.</p>

  <p>Lovely, he thought as he talked&mdash;amazingly lovely. The contours of
  her face had some indefinable value that he had not found in any other. In a
  pause she asked:</p>

  <p>"But you are ruthless!" (He rather liked that.) "You would stop at nothing
  to reach your end?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Knowledge is power only when it can be utilized for the benefit
  of its holders."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is strange&mdash;because it seems you have no objective. You wish to
  get nowhere, only somewhere better at all costs. I could understand if it was
  for a definite place."</p>

  <p>He was flattered by her disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Have you any objective?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Happiness... security. The security that a peasant workman could give his
  wife."</p>

  <p>"In fact, marriage?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly and mushroomed the red end of her cigarette in the
  silver ash-tray.</p>

  <p>"Yes... I would fight like a devil to retain that. It is my idea of
  heaven. I have a little sister&mdash;here in Bukharest."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him slowly.</p>

  <p>"A sister is like a baby: one does things and puts The Little Green Man
  under the pillow for her sake."</p>

  <p>She seemed to shake herself as though she were throwing off an unpleasant
  garment. When she spoke her voice was almost gay.</p>

  <p>"We are getting tedious. Shall I sing, or shall we talk?"</p>

  <p>"We have talked too much," said Fathergill.</p>

  <p>He walked to the window and pulled the curtains together.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>A few months later an eminent firm of lawyers wrote to Mr. Linden to the
  effect that they had a client who wished to acquire oil land. They understood
  he had a property, etc.</p>

  <p>Mr. Linden, a very happy and cheerful man, wrote asking that the offer
  should be reduced to sterling.</p>

  <p>There were many reasons why adventures in Roumanian oil should have no
  further appeal, and why he wished to convert a property of dubious value into
  something which paid six per cent with monotonous regularity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fathergill, who had reached Paris, received the lawyers' intimation
  with mild interest. It was curious, he mused, how much labor, how many hours
  of anxiety are involved needlessly and uselessly because one cannot foresee
  the end. In the months that had elapsed between his going to Roumania and his
  return to Paris he had become a millionaire, and every one of his banks
  believed that they carried his heaviest account.</p>

  <p>He had met a man in Constantinople, an international financier, who bought
  properties for a song and talked them into cantatas. Dog does not eat dog
  except in Constantinople. Mr. Fathergill was unaware of this exception. He
  acquired a tract of wild mountain-land, and a concession sealed and signed by
  the Turkish Government. And on the day his check was honored and the vendor
  was on his way, per Orient Express, to acquire a timber concession in Sofia,
  a miracle happened. A forgotten and unpaid prospector made a discovery. Mr.
  Fathergill believed in quick profits, particularly if they were big profits.
  The syndicate which took over his holding and his concession offered him a
  head-reeling sum.</p>

  <p>The oil proposition was now an amusing sideline... but there was
  Molly.</p>

  <p>"That may be awkward," said Charles, and pulled at his nose
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>For Mr. Linden was married again. Molly had mentioned the fact in one of
  her cold, proper letters. She did not tell him that John Linden had become
  de-Victorianized and that Thursby Grant was a frequent visitor at Wimbledon
  Common.</p>

  <p>John Linden wrote. The letter was awaiting the wanderer on his arrival at
  the Meurice. Would he come over and spend Christmas with the family?</p>

  <p>"I am getting rid of my oil lands&mdash;some foolish man wishes to buy and
  has offered me a good price."</p>

  <p>Charles left for London on the next day: he would have preferred to have
  spent Christmas in Paris. The boat train was crowded, the sea choppy. Mr.
  Fathergill arrived in London a very ruffled man. Paris would have been ideal
  at Christmas&mdash;or Bukharest. Irene! A most unsubstantial dream. The
  fragrant memory of her caught at his heart. A week after he had left
  Bukharest he had gone back to find her. Peter contorted himself
  apologetically. The lady had left Bukharest: he had inquired for her; some
  other guest had desired speech and song. It was a thousand pities. She was a
  veritable princess. But (here he brightened) there was a beautiful little
  girl, a veritable lady....</p>

  <p>Charles Fathergill had shaken his head. He looked for her in Budapest;
  caused inquiries to be made in Vienna... no.</p>

  <p>He stalked up and down his beautiful drawing-room, his hands in his
  pockets. Wimbledon... roast turkey... plum pudding... Molly Linden... he
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>Snow was falling heavily when his car pulled up under the portico, and
  there was John Linden, rubicund and white, and there were holly wreaths
  hanging on the panelled walls of the hall, and Molly, gauche and awkward, and
  an uncomfortable Thursby Grant&mdash;Charles could have fallen on his neck.
  And there too was a stranger&mdash;a pretty, slim child in white, with a
  clear skin and dark hair and eyes, and....</p>

  <p>"You haven't met Mrs. Linden, old boy." John was very jovial, very
  excited. "I told you I would get my romance. We met on the train just outside
  of Trieste... Irene, darling!"</p>

  <p>Irene, darling!</p>

  <p>There she was, her calm, glorious self, framed in a doorway, as he had
  seen her before. Only now she wore purple... it suited her better than black,
  completed her regality.</p>

  <p>Her eyes met his. Only the faintest hint of recognition lit and died
  within their unfathomable deeps. Had she been prepared, he would not have
  seen even that.</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you... Mrs. Linden."</p>

  <p>He took her hand in his; the pressure was just as firm as, and no firmer
  than, one would expect in a hostess.</p>

  <p>"Come along to my study&mdash;the man will take the suitcase to your
  room."</p>

  <p>In the study Charles drank a little port and listened.</p>

  <p>"Um... about Molly. I've been thinking&mdash;you don't mind if we have
  this out right away?"</p>

  <p>Fathergill shook his head. He preferred that the matter of Molly should be
  disposed of.</p>

  <p>"My wife&mdash;by the way, she was the Princess Irene Dalruski&mdash;had a
  terrible time in the revolution; I will tell you all about it one of these
  days&mdash;my wife thinks it would be a mistake for Molly to marry except
  where her heart is. Old-fashioned, eh?&mdash;By the way, did you see
  Vera&mdash;my wife's sister, a dear kid...."</p>

  <p>How curiously futile everything was, Charles Fathergill thought. All his
  scheming&mdash;the Roumanian lawyer with a moist face. Suppose now he had put
  no spoke in the wheel, had let the reports go forward, and John Linden had
  entered into his minor riches, and instead had fastened to himself with hooks
  of iron this find of Peter's....</p>

  <p>He was very silent at dinner; scarcely looked at the glorious being at the
  head of this suburban table; permitted himself the fatuity of wearing a paper
  cap. Molly thought he was sorrowing over a lost bride and cried herself to
  sleep that night.</p>

  <p>"Have a talk with Irene. I'd like you to know her," said John Linden.</p>

  <p>There was a little drawing-room that was half conservatory, and was in
  consequence a place that smelt faintly of the earth. Hostess and guest
  detached themselves from the noisy group about a Christmas tree.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear?" Charles Fathergill closed the door. His heart was beating
  a shade faster than usual, a sense of exhilaration made him feel a little
  drunk.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>She did not sit down. Curiously was the scene reminiscent of another
  meeting&mdash;eighteen hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>"You have reached your objective?" he said, and, when she slowly nodded:
  "I have searched Europe for you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>He was nonplussed for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think?" he asked, and went on quickly: "We're going to be very
  good friends, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so. You won't come here again, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Linden's a great friend of mine."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is the reason. I have heard a great deal about you, without
  realizing who you were."</p>

  <p>He smiled at this; the hinted disparagement pleased him. She had aroused
  that kind of emotion once before.</p>

  <p>"You still believe that knowledge is power?"</p>

  <p>He still believed that. This was the moment he would have chosen to hammer
  home the guiding principle of his life.</p>

  <p>"And The Little Green Man?" he bantered. "Has he been smashed?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. Once or twice I thought I would bury him, with all that belongs to
  his day. Something prevented me."</p>

  <p>A very long, uncomfortable silence followed. The sound of laughter came
  faintly from the larger drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"I have rather a nice apartment in Carlton House Gardens. I hope you will
  come along and see me. Often."</p>

  <p>She made no reply. He repeated the invitation.</p>

  <p>"You mean that I should enter a new bondage for an indefinite period?"</p>

  <p>She looked round.</p>

  <p>"It needs Peter to smooth over the crudities."</p>

  <p>He thought she was being very sensible and was relieved.</p>

  <p>"And if I cannot find time to see your beautiful flat? Will you grow
  reminiscent some day when you meet John Linden?"</p>

  <p>He did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You may say: 'What purpose will that serve?' You asked me that
  before. I reply now, as I replied then: 'Knowledge is of value so long as it
  is used. A threat of its use, unless it is backed by the will to use it, is
  so much foolish talk.' It is because you believe, rightly, that not in a
  spirit of revenge, but as a logical consequence...."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>She half turned towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to be sure. Come and be festive... have you seen my little
  sister?"</p>

  <p>"A lovely child," he said conventionally.</p>

  <p>That was all that passed between them: they did not speak again. He asked
  for a glass of milk to be sent to his room, and this was done.</p>

  <p>When he went upstairs to bed he looked for her, but she had already
  retired. The servant who knocked at his door the next morning could not make
  him hear. She went in and drew up the blinds, put down the tray, and did not
  notice that the glass she had taken up the previous night was gone.</p>

  <p>"Your tea, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>Even John Linden did not believe that Fathergill was dead until the doctor
  came.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry your Christmas has been spoilt," said Irene gravely, and
  looked from him to the big fire which burnt in her bedroom. The Little Green
  Man had already melted out of sight.</p>
