  <h2>I. &mdash; NEW PROJECTOR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE room was like a tomb. There were only the gray walls,
  the gray floor and ceiling.</p>

  <p>There was only the rasp of my irate breathing as I stood with my back
  against the locked door, waiting for something unguessable to happen.</p>

  <p>The melodramatic mystery with which Malvin Parker surrounds his
  demonstration of each new invention has irritated me ever since the fall
  midnight in 1952. This was when he locked the door of the cubbyhole we shared
  at Tech U., produced what seemed to be an ordinary dinner plate somewhat
  dirtier than the hundreds we washed every day in the Commons' steamy kitchen
  and with no other tool but his fingernails, stripped a thin film from it to
  display it clean and sparkling as if it had just come from the tubs.</p>

  <p>That was the first piece ever made of the laminated tableware that has
  emancipated the world's housewives from the postprandial sink. On that plate,
  and a hundred-odd other products of Parker's fecund brain, were founded the
  vast Loring Enterprises and my own not inconsiderable fortune. The best piece
  of business I've ever done was to sign him up, that very night, to the
  contract by which I engaged to support him and his dependents for fife in
  exchange for a blanket assignment of all his past and future patents.</p>

  <p>Best for Dr. Malvin Parker as well as for me. Were it not for Billingsley
  Loring's genius at industrial promotion, Parker would be just another
  crackpot inventor wearing out chairs in one office anteroom after
  another.</p>

  <p>Yes, for well over a quarter-century I've found it profitable to humor his
  whims and so when he challenged me to make it impossible for anyone to enter
  this room in his laboratory-dwelling, I proceeded to do so without asking the
  questions I knew he'd refuse to answer.</p>

  <p>There were no windows, of course, and the ventilating outlets were
  screened with fine wire mesh welded in place. I had my men strip the chamber
  to its structural plasticrete and spray all its surfaces with transparent
  Loring Instant-Dry Quikenam. The single door was fitted with another of
  Parker's devices, a phonolock which I myself set to a keyword I confided to
  no one. It opened inward, moreover, so that with my back planted against it,
  no one could enter without pushing me aside.</p>

  <p>In the harsh glare of the cold-light strip edging the ceiling, the uniform
  grayness robbed the room of shape and dimension. It was an illimitable,
  terrifying vastness. It closed in on me so tightly I could not move, could
  scarcely breathe. If only there were some detail; even only a shadow for my
  eyes to seize upon. If only there were some sound&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was sound, a sourceless drone barely audible. There was a shadow;
  the shadow of a shadow so tenuous I could not make out if it was right on top
  of me, on the opposite wall or in between.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Malvin Parker stood in the center of the room! He couldn't possibly have
  gotten in here. He was here, undeniably, his great grizzled head hunched
  forward on the habitually bowed shoulders of his bearlike hulk, a triumphant
  smile flickering in the deep-sunk dark pools of his eyes. He&mdash;The answer
  came to me. "Oh, no, Mal Parker. You can't fool with a tri-dimensional video
  image of yourself."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," his projected voice sighed but on his pictured face that
  smile of his deepened. "I wouldn't try."</p>

  <p>The apparition stepped forward, grabbed my forearm with gnarled and very
  tangible fingers.</p>

  <p>"Does that feel like a video image?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Urggh!</i>" I jerked loose, butted him with my shoulder, so hard that
  despite his greater height and weight he staggered side-ward. My throat
  clamped as I goggled at a brown flurry of lab coat, at a leg and
  foot&mdash;</p>

  <p>The rest of Malvin Parker had vanished!</p>

  <p>He at once reappeared, looking a little scared.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have done that, Billiken." That nickname, underlying my
  shortness and rotundity, was like it slap in my face and he knew it. "You
  might have electrocuted me."</p>

  <p>"Electrocuted! With what? There's nothing but empty space here."</p>

  <p>"Right, Billiken. But there are plenty of bare high voltage leads where I
  am."</p>

  <p>"Where are you?" I gagged. He had appeared in a room it was utterly
  impossible to enter, he'd proved to me that he was indubitably here, now he
  told me he was somewhere else. "Where the devil are you?"</p>

  <p>"In my electronics laboratory, a floor above you. What you're gaping at
  is&mdash;well, you might call it a material image."</p>

  <p>"I might," I flung back, hoarsely. "But I don't know why. It sounds like
  gobbledygook to me."</p>

  <p>He chuckled again, enjoying my discomfiture. "Look, Billiken. You're
  familiar with the principles of tele&mdash;" He broke off, looked to the
  right at something I could not see, or at someone! For he was saying, "Just a
  moment, dear. I'm talking with Bill Loring," and I knew who it was. Only two
  persons could have brought that tender affection to his seamed countenance.
  One of them, his wife Neva, died eight years ago.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," he responded to a voice I could not hear, and
  turned back to me. "That irreverent daughter of mine suggests that we
  continue our discussion over drinks in her sitting room. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>I said it was a good idea, and meant it whole-souledly. I wanted
  desperately to get out of this blasted room where I talked with a man who
  insisted he wasn't there.</p>

  <p>"Very well." He nodded. "We'll meet you there."</p>

  <p>He disappeared again. For good.</p>

  <p>The room was just as it had been when I locked myself into it, the
  ventilator screens unbroken, the paint film unmarred. Unless I'd been
  hypnotized by the droning sound, which had now cut off. The door that swung
  open as I spoke the keyword was opening for the first time since I'd closed
  myself in here alone.</p>

  <p>But my biceps still ached from the grip of Malvin Parker's fingers,
  digging in.</p>

  <p>Better than he could suspect, I knew the way to the jewelcase-like boudoir
  Neva designed to set off her fragile, almost ethereal beauty. My breath
  caught in a sudden poignant twinge of recollection as Sherry Parker smiled at
  me from the chair where she presided over a gleaming Autobar. She was her
  mother at twenty all over again; the same cameo features, the same glowing,
  amber hair, the same golden skin.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Billiken!" she exclaimed. "You're an old meanie staying away from
  me for months."</p>

  <p>"Now, now, my dear," I chuckled indulgently. "You haven't missed me an
  iota. Not," I cocked, an eyebrow at the two youths who hovered over her,
  "with so much pleasanter companions than an old codger like me."</p>

  <p>"Oh these!" She pouted prettily. "These are just Dad's assistants. Robin
  Adlair." The burly, fair-haired chap to whom she gestured grinned down at me.
  "And Bart Murtry."</p>

  <p>"This is an honor, Mr. Loring." Murtry was only slightly taller than
  myself, narrow-faced, his hair black as Sheol, his black eyes sultry. "You've
  been my inspiration ever since I read Lorne Randall's 'Colossus of Commerce'
  as a kid. That's a great book, sir, about a great man."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the book's a good job." It ought to be. I'd paid Randall plenty to
  write it. "Nice to have you with the organization, Mr. Murtry." I turned back
  to Sherry. "May I have a Martini, my dear? No bitters."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Sherry smiled and nodded at me.</p>

  <p>"And no olive. I haven't forgotten, Uncle Billiken." Somehow I didn't mind
  her calling me that, perhaps because it reminded me how Neva and I used to
  laugh, in this very room, over what her baby tongue made of Billingsley. "By
  the way, Dad asked me to tell you that he'll be right in. He stopped to make
  some notes."</p>

  <p>Her slim fingers twirled dials atop the sculptured silver chest that sat
  on a low table before her and it started to whirr softly.</p>

  <p>"You know, Mr. Loring," Murtry said. "That Autobar epitomizes for me the
  difference between you and Dr. Parker. He invented the mechanism that
  concocts any beverage you set the dials to and delivers it in precisely the
  right glass at precisely the right temperature, but what did he have when he
  was through? An ugly and expensive contrivance whose sale would have been
  limited to a few hotels and restaurants.</p>

  <p>"It took you to have casings designed for it that blend with any decor and
  engineering techniques that brought its cost within the budget of the average
  family. And then you had your advertising and public relations staff put on a
  campaign that made it something without which no home could be considered
  well-appointed. You transformed the demand for it from a few thousands to
  millions."</p>

  <p>"That's right, my boy. That's the story."</p>

  <p>"But not all of it, Bart," the blond Adlair drawled, his high-cheekboned,
  blunt-jawed face naive to my quick glance. "Billingsley Loring didn't take
  any risk in exploiting the demand he created. What he did, as he always does
  with new and untried products, was to turn over the Autobar patent to a
  corporation set up for the purpose and which, while he still held control,
  contracted with Loring Enterprises to manufacture the contraption on a
  cost-plus basis and to sell it as sole agent. If it had been a failure the
  loss would have been the Autobar Company's stockholders'. Since it succeeded,
  the major portion of the profits go to Loring Enterprises. To Billingsley
  Loring."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with that?" Murtry demanded.</p>

  <p>"Did I say anything was wrong with it?" Adlair spread big hands almost as
  acid-stained as Parker's, blue eyes innocent. "I merely mentioned it because
  Lorne Randall left it out of the chapter in his book from which you cribbed
  what you've just said."</p>

  <p>"Cribbed!" White spots pitted the wing-tips of the other youth's nostrils.
  "Why you rat!"</p>

  <p>"Bart!" Sherry exclaimed, a warning note in her voice. And then, "It's
  time for the Comedy Players, Bart. Turn them on for me, like a good boy.
  Please."</p>

  <h2>II. &mdash; INDUSTRIAL GIANT</h2>

  <p class="first">NOW there, I thought, as he went across the room, is a young
  man who might be more useful to me than puttering his time away in a
  laboratory. He thumbed a switch. On the wall an oblong brightened, took on
  depth and perspective. The scene was a moonlit garden filled with soft music
  from an unseen orchestra.</p>

  <p>Quarter lifesize but otherwise convincingly real-seeming, a girl in a
  diaphanous evening dress strolled into it, a tuxedoed youth close behind. I
  didn't hear what they were saying because Malvin Parker entered just then and
  came toward me.</p>

  <p>"About time you showed up," I growled. "Do you think I've got nothing to
  do but stand around waiting for you?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry." He didn't sound it. "I was delayed. Thank you." He took the
  filled wineglass Adlair had brought to him. "Port, eh? Just what I need." The
  blond chap handed me my cocktail. "Robin," Parker said, "is my good right
  hand, Billiken."</p>

  <p>"So I rather imagined." Seeing the two together, I realized how much alike
  they were. Not physically, except for their height, but in another, more
  significant way. I didn't like this Adlair. "What about the monkey business
  you pulled in that room, Mal? How did you get in and out of it?"</p>

  <p>"I told you that I wasn't in it, except in somewhat the same sense Lilli
  Denton and Storm Rand," he gestured to the screen, "are in this one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now. Those images look and sound real enough but if I went over
  there and tried to touch them, I'd feel only the wall. Back there I not only
  heard and saw you. I felt you."</p>

  <p>Parker's taunting smile was back in his eyes. "No, Billiken. You did not
  feel me. Look. The images you see on that video screen are complexes of
  colored light produced, in the apparatus behind it. They are so modulated by
  impulses broadcast from a studio a thousand miles away, as to affect your
  retina in the same way it would be by light reflected directly from the
  persons and objects depicted. What you hear is sound produced in that same
  apparatus and similarly modulated to affect your ears in the same way as
  sounds produced in that studio."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the lecture on video," I snapped. "But what's it got to do
  with the subject?"</p>

  <p>"The principle is the same."</p>

  <p>"The devil it is. Light is energy. The electromagnetic force actuating the
  loudspeaker is energy. You can modulate energy by energy transmitted from a
  remote source so as to give me the illusion of seeing and hearing objects
  located at that source. You can't give me the illusion of feeling something I
  don't actually touch."</p>

  <p>Parker's grizzled eyebrows arched quizzically.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can't feel energy." Adlair, I noticed, had gone back to the
  girl. They were laughing together at some banter from the screen and Murtry,
  beside me, watched them with smoldering eyes. "I can feel only something
  material and you can't create matter, much less modulate it from a distance
  to seem what it is not."</p>

  <p>"No? Remember the mole you used to have on your cheek, Billiken?"</p>

  <p>I remembered it. I remembered how it had bothered Neva. "What about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You had it removed by what's called knifeless surgery. Nothing material
  touched your flesh: High-frequency waves, pure energy, sliced away a bit of
  your bodily tissue as efficiently as the most material of steel scalpels
  could have. Is there any reason energy in some such form might not affect
  other bits of tissue in ways similar to that in which they are affected by
  matter?"</p>

  <p>I couldn't think of any. I had to admit so, grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"Now," Parker smiled, "when you say you 'feel' an object, you really mean
  that certain specialized bits of your bodily tissue, the nerve endings in
  your skin, are affected in ways your brain learned in early infancy to mean
  that they are in contact with matter having certain physical properties;
  hardness, form, texture, temperature which sum up to a certain mental
  concept&mdash;the object in question. If those same nerve endings are
  affected in precisely the same way by, say, some form of energy, would that
  not mean to your brain that they are in contact with that same object?"</p>

  <p>"Well, probably."</p>

  <p>"And if at the same time you seemed to see and hear that object the
  illusion would be complete, would it not? The illusion, for instance, that I
  was actually, physically present in a room I could not possibly enter."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So the apparition with which I'd wrestled had been as unreal, as
  insubstantial as the boy and girl locked in closed embrace on the video
  screen across the room.</p>

  <p>"From apparatus on the other side of the wall," Parker explained, "which
  was permeable to the range of frequencies I used, I projected a
  tri-dimensional video image of myself plus a complex of energies that
  affected your sensory-nerve endings as the surfaces of my body and its
  clothing would have. Your own brain did the rest."</p>

  <p>"It certainly did. I could have sworn&mdash;Hold it," I interrupted
  myself. "How could I throw an&mdash;an illusion around?" I'd recalled how I'd
  flung him from me, how all of him but his leg had vanished. "How could I
  almost electrocute an image?"</p>

  <p>"Not you, Billiken. It was your image that came within an ace of throwing
  me against a live busbar in my lab above you. Your see, I had a transmitter
  scanning you too so that I could watch your reactions." His eye-corners
  crinkled with puckish amusement. "You should have seen the expression on your
  face when I suddenly appeared to you."</p>

  <p>"It must have been very funny." The Martini I sipped was acrid. Sherry
  must have put in the bitters after all. "That's a neat gadget you've trumped
  up, Mal." I made myself sound admiring. "One of the neatest you've ever
  produced." And then I let him have it. "But what good is it?"</p>

  <p>He stared at me as if I'd spoken in some unintelligible language. "What
  good?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. What are its commercial possibilities? How can I make a profit
  out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I don't know," Parker stammered, his eyes satisfactorily miserable.
  "I&mdash;Well, it was a challenging problem and I worked it out."</p>

  <p>"On my time and at my expense. So suppose you get busy now and work out
  something this cute trick of yours can do that people will pay money for.
  Some practical use it can be put to that isn't already being served by
  conventional video."</p>

  <p>He wasn't looking at me. He was looking at his daughter and on his seamed
  countenance was the almost pleading expression that used to be there when
  he'd look at his wife as I dressed him down. Neva would laugh a little and
  then tell him that even if he didn't owe it to me to be practical, he did to
  her. Sherry's velvet-red lips parted but before she could speak, Bart Murtry
  forestalled her.</p>

  <p>"May I make a suggestion, Mr. Loring?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, my boy. The Loring organization's all one big, happy family.
  Nothing pleases me more than if one of my&mdash;er&mdash;children, so to
  speak, comes up with a good, workable idea."</p>

  <p>Robin Adlair had decided to take an interest, was coming toward us. "What
  you said just now," Murtry continued, "reminded me that video is not a
  perfect advertising medium. It can only tell its audience about a product and
  show them what it looks like. With this new invention you can permit people
  actually to handle things&mdash;woman's hats, for instance." The black eyes
  were glowing. "Let the average woman try a becoming hat on and she won't be
  able to resist buying it. The same for dresses. And as for men&mdash;they
  could actually shave with the razor blade you want to sell them, write with a
  new kind of fountain pen, even try out the controls of a helicopter or
  roadcar. The possibilities are limitless."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my boy. Excellent. I can see our prospectus now. The
  Loring&mdash;er&mdash;Teleseler puts your product into the nation's
  homes!"</p>

  <p>"Bunk."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I wheeled to Adlair, from whom the interruption had come. "You insolent
  young whippersnapper! How dare you call anything I say bunk?"</p>

  <p>"Because that's what it is," he drawled, grinning at me. "You can't put
  anyone's product into even one home till you've got a receiver there. Who's
  going to fill a room with apparatus just so they can try on hats or shave
  with razors that disappear the instant they turn off the current?"</p>

  <p>"Fill a room, nothing," Murtry snapped, glaring at the blond fellow as if
  he very cheerfully could wring his neck. "It can be engineered down to
  convenient size."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, Bart. Maybe it can, but you still can't engineer out the extra
  tubes and coils and condensers that always will run up its cost to double
  that of a video which will give its owner exactly as much information and
  entertainment. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's it!" Mal Parker's exclamation cut Adlair short. "That's the
  moneymaking angle you're looking for, Billiken. Entertainment."</p>

  <p>This was something new, Parker offering an idea for making money. "Go
  ahead, Mal," I encouraged him, silkily. It would be ridiculous, of course,
  and I'd have another chance to slap him down. "Tell us about it. What sort of
  entertainment video can't present as well?"</p>

  <p>"A sort these youngsters, wouldn't know anything about because
  tri-dimensional video killed it before they were old enough to be entertained
  by anything except a rattle. Look, Billiken. Has any show video has brought
  to you ever given you anywhere near the kick we used to get sitting in the
  balcony of the old Bijou Theater? Wasn't there something we got not from the
  performers but from the audience? Didn't sharing our emotions with a thousand
  others physically present heighten our own emotions?"</p>

  <p>"Mass hysteria," I grunted. "Crowd psychology&mdash;crowd!" I caught up
  the word. "Those old shows certainly did pull in the crowds and they paid.
  They paid plenty, but the huge wages offered actors and actresses by the
  video companies made it impossible&mdash;Hold on!" The nape of my neck
  puckered with the chill prickles of inspiration. "This thing of
  yours&mdash;there's no limit to the number of material images it can recreate
  from one prototype, is there?"</p>

  <p>"No, Billiken. Nor to the distance from the original."</p>

  <p>"And to all intents and purposes they're exactly the same as living
  persons. The scenery too. We'd need to build only one set." My mind was
  working at fever heat now. "We could have a single company acting in, say New
  York, and it would appear simultaneously in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Any number of cities, towns and villages," Parker caught fire from me,
  "wherever you had theaters with identical stages!"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. So that the cost of the original production can be divided by
  any desired number of theaters into which your device can put it. The
  possibilities for profit are enormous." I pulled in breath. "You see, Mal,
  what a practical man can do with one of your scientific toys."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful," Murtry exclaimed, but Adlair simply looked confused, as did
  Sherry. Her father, however was for once properly impressed. "I never cease
  being amazed at the way your mind works, Billiken. You honestly think that
  you&mdash;I mean I suppose that by tomorrow morning you'll have your bright
  young men selling stock in the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Loring Multidram Corporation," I named it in one of those flashes of
  inspiration Lorne Randall calls the mark of my peculiar genius. "No. Not
  quite as quickly as all that. We've got to put on a public demonstration
  first, in the ten key cities where my best suck&mdash;er&mdash;where the
  outstanding investors in my promotions reside."</p>

  <p>I was pacing the floor now as my mind raced, planning the operation. "Mal.
  Prepare blueprints and specifications for the patent lawyers and another set
  for the engineering department so that they can start producing the pilot
  sets. You'll supervise that. Murtry," I turned to the swarthy youth. "I want
  you to take charge of erecting the theaters and installing the apparatus as
  the sets come out of the workshop. I'll have the office give you a list of
  the cities. Sherry, my dear. How would you like to select the first play we
  present, hire the director and performers and so on?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were topazes lit from within. "I'd love it."</p>

  <p>"The job's yours, then." She'd get a tremendous kick out of it and it
  didn't make much difference how good the play was or how well acted, the
  novelty would put it over. "I'll have my regular staff take care of the
  publicity." <i>That</i> I couldn't trust to amateurs. "I think that covers
  everything."</p>

  <p>"How about Robin?" Sherry asked. "You haven't given him anything to
  do."</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't." I looked at the fellow, standing spraddle-legged in the
  center of the room and thought of a way to wipe that lazy but somehow
  insolent grin from his face. "I'll tell you what you can do, Adlair. You can
  assist your friend Murtry. Under his orders, of course."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; DEATH FROM A SHADOW</h2>

  <p class="first">CERTAIN disturbing business developments engrossed all my
  attention and I completely forgot about the Multidram project until my
  secretary reminded me that the demonstration was only a week off. I learned
  then that one change had been made in the original plan. Sherry Parker had
  employed a number of players under contract to rival video networks with
  studios located at different points in the United States, two in England and
  one in Paris.</p>

  <p>Since this made it impossible to assemble the cast at any one place, it
  had been decided to install transmitters as well as receivers in all ten
  theaters. In this way some performers could speak their lines in New York,
  others in Los Angeles, London and so on, but the net effect still would be
  the same as though all were playing on a single stage.</p>

  <p>The scenery was erected in Los Angeles, would be reproduced in material
  image on the other stages. The originals of the smaller properties, books,
  maps, and the like, would be placed at the location of the characters who
  initially handled them.</p>

  <p>It was Bart Murtry who'd worked out this solution to the difficulty. He'd
  further justified my estimate of his ability by building the ten theaters in
  exact replica, auditoriums as well as stages, thus effecting a considerable
  saving in architects' fees and the cost of fabrication.</p>

  <p>Instead of a sophisticated, modern piece written for video, Sherry had
  preserved the archaic flavor of the presentation by reviving a mid-twentieth
  century war play replete with the swashbuckling heroics, air raid alarms,
  gunfire and other bellicose trappings of that bygone era. All this gave me an
  idea. "See here, Foster," I told my secretary, "We'll reserve seats and issue
  tickets to the people we're inviting to the premiere."</p>

  <p>"An excellent idea, sir." He hesitated, tugged at the sandy mustache he
  was cultivating with sparse success. "Er&mdash;what <i>are</i> tickets, Mr.
  Loring?"</p>

  <p>I laughed, for the first time in weeks. "Tickets, Foster, are&mdash;Oh,
  look here." I riffled the sheets he'd laid on my desk, found the plan of the
  auditoriums. "Suppose we mark these rows of seats A, B, C and so on, starting
  at the front, and number the chairs in each row, like this."</p>

  <p>It wasn't till I sketched an old-fashioned theatre ticket, with its coded
  stub, that the principle finally penetrated. "Now I understand, sir. It's
  like place-cards at a formal banquet, a system of assigning the more
  desirable locations to guests you want particularly to honor."</p>

  <p>"Precisely." There was no need to explain that it also was a way of
  establishing a price scale based more on the snob-value of location than the
  ease of hearing and seeing. "That's why I shall myself decide who is to sit
  where. Let me have those lists of invites."</p>

  <p>"Here they are, sir." He handed them to me. "But I'm afraid you won't have
  time to do that just now, Mr. Loring. Mr. Hanscom's waiting to see you."</p>

  <p>"Mr. who?"</p>

  <p>"Maxwell Hanscom of the United Nations Securities Control Board. You gave
  him an eleven o'clock appointment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I remember now." I didn't have to remember. I'd been
  anticipating Hanscom's visit all morning, and not with pleasure. "About this
  Multidram demonstration, Foster. Inform Murtry I'll want to inspect the
  entire installation and attend a dress rehearsal." My fingers drummed the arm
  of my chair. "All right. Send Mr. Hanscom in."</p>

  <p>The door to my office is thirty feet from my desk. By the time the gray
  little man had crossed that space, I knew that here was a government official
  I might be able to deceive for a little while but could not buy.</p>

  <p><br><br>>New Orleans, Manchester, Rio de Janeiro and the rest of the ten cities
  selected for the première Multridram performance of <i>Escape from
  Destiny</i> saw something that Spring day they'd not seen for a generation.
  Crowds. There was, it seemed, some strange, atavistic contagion in the notion
  of people actually gathering together to watch and listen to anything. The
  thousands who milled about the identical structures Murtry had erected could
  observe the proceedings sitting comfortably in their homes far better than
  being jostled and trampled here, but here they were.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>As sweating police cleared a path for me to the entrance of the New York
  Bijou&mdash;so Malvin Parker had named the theaters in obeisance to our
  student rendezvous&mdash;I knew Billingsley Loring was on the brink of his
  greatest success, or at the end of his career.</p>

  <p>Sherry was in Los Angeles, where the majority of the company were
  physically present, her father in Chicago supervising the master
  switchboard. Bart Murtry had taken off a couple of hours ago for London, to
  oversee the pick-up for the two British Isles stages and Paris and
  Moscow.</p>

  <p>Just where Robin Adlair was I did not know. My last-minute decision anent
  the seating arrangements had necessitated a rush job of training ushers which
  Murtry had turned over to him. All the past week he'd been darting about the
  world in the Loring Skyfleet's speediest stratojetter and we'd completely
  lost track of him.</p>

  <p>From what I saw here in New York, I had to admit that he'd done a good
  job. Quaintly clad in long-trousered, button-studded blue uniforms such as I
  hadn't seen for decades, the teen-age youngsters were well rehearsed. Not so
  the gathering audience. In spite of the careful letters of explanation that
  had accompanied each ticket, many were lamentably confused as to what was
  expected of them. One couple in their thirties, as a matter of fact, had to
  be forcibly removed from the front row seats to which they insisted they were
  entitled by the rule of first come, first served.</p>

  <p>I'd given strict instructions that every spectator was to occupy the
  location his ticket called for and the Loring organization is schooled to
  obey instructions to the letter.</p>

  <p>The turmoil finally subsided. I went down the central aisle to the seat I
  had reserved for myself. A cherub-faced lad rushed up to me, checked my stub.
  "A-1. Thank you, sir." He saluted and rushed busily off again. This first row
  of chairs was separated only by a brass rail from a six foot deep, empty
  trench that ran clear across the auditorium's floor. Beyond this rose the
  curving face of the raised stage and from this in turn, high and graceful,
  the shimmering golden folds of a vast curtain emblazoned with huge,
  floral-wreathed L's.</p>

  <p>The sourceless illumination that filled the auditorium began to dim: A
  hush of tense expectancy gripped the audience. There was an instant of
  complete, velvety darkness, then a glitter and flash of chromium and polished
  wood exploded in front of and below me; musical instruments catching sudden
  light concentrated in the pit and splintering it into a myriad coruscations.
  In the blackness behind me, a thousand throats gasped. The dress-suited
  musicians swept bows across strings. A single handclap spatted as some
  oldster recalled the ways of his youth, then another, a third.</p>

  <p>The sounds rippled, spread, merged into a torrent of applause.</p>

  <p>The clapping died away. The orchestra's triumphal strains waned till only
  a single violin sang softly. An aureate glow spread over the great curtain
  and it was rising, slowly at first, then more swiftly.</p>

  <p>The stage it revealed was vacant! Bare floorboards stretched back to a
  blank wall of gray plasticrete. Something had gone wrong.</p>

  <p>No. The stage was transformed into a room ugly with the flowered design of
  its papered walls, shut in by the black cloth awkwardly tacked over windows.
  Clumsy wooden furniture cluttered it, a table was covered by a white cloth
  and set as for a meal not yet served. In the left-hand sidewall&mdash;the
  stage's left&mdash;was a closed door, a wooden door complete with ceramic
  doorknob. Another, similar door to the right rear was open a bare inch.
  Holding it so and peering through the crack was a woman's taut, listening
  figure.</p>

  <p>Slumped in a chair by the table, head propped in elbow-propped hands and
  every line eloquent of a fatigue that rendered him incapable of the fear that
  gripped the woman, was a young man in clothing torn, filthy with mud.</p>

  <p>The applause rose again in a great, cresting wave that washed over me.</p>

  <p>Underlying the surf of pounding palms was another, rhythmic sound the
  world has not heard for decades, the ominous thud of marching feet dulled by
  distance. Nearing it beat down the applause, seemed just outside the
  black-swathed windows.</p>

  <p>A voice suddenly barked an unintelligible order. Silence. A sense of
  apprehension flowed from the woman at the door, a feeling of fear that could
  not possibly have been transmitted to that audience by a video image. The
  unseen voice spoke again, gutturally, and the feet thudded again,
  dispersing.</p>

  <p>"They've tracked you to the village," the woman whispered. "They're
  searching the houses along the street." She pushed the door shut
  soundlessly, turned from it.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Hand to throat she moved across the floor toward the unmoving man at the
  table, eyes big with terror in a white and haggard face. In Neva's face!
  Neva&mdash;No, not Neva of course but her daughter Sherry&mdash;whispered.
  "They'll be here in a moment. Come. I'll hide you."</p>

  <p>Why was Sherry playing the part for which Lilli Denton had rehearsed? I
  was out of my seat. Crouching low to avoid being silhouetted against the
  lighted stag I made for its left-hand corner.</p>

  <p>"I'm not hiding." The voice above me was hoarse with weariness and defeat.
  "I'm going out there to give myself up. You people have suffered
  enough&mdash;" It faded, as I went through the little door and found myself a
  place crowded with the glowing bulbs, of coils and condenser's and
  serpentining leads of the Multidram apparatus.</p>

  <p>The air was prickly with the tension of high potential, an incautious
  movement here might mean instant and terrible death. Explaining the setup
  last week, Bart Murtry had warned me not to brush against this lead, this
  switch. I was tight-strung, the palms sweating, by the time I reached the
  wings and looked through what to the audience seemed to be a papered wall, a
  closed door, out into the black dark of the auditorium.</p>

  <p>I could make out clearly only the first row of rapt faces, the gap made by
  the aisle and the seat I'd left unoccupied. Directly in front of me the man
  was on his feet now, Sherry beside him, their backs to me as, frozen in
  consternation, they watched the other door thud shut behind a bull-necked
  individual who snatched an automatic from the belt-holster of his green
  uniform.</p>

  <p>His lips stretched in a humorless, sinister smile. "As I thought."
  Vindictive lights crawled in his skin-pouched eyes. "I knew only you and your
  blackguard husband would dare give this pig a refuge. That is why I sent my
  men to search the other houses and came here alone."</p>

  <p>The woman gathered herself, forced out words. "You mean that your silence
  can be purchased, Captain Markin. With what? We have nothing left with which
  to bribe you."</p>

  <p>"Except yourself, my dear Elsa&mdash;not forced but willing. You are a
  fever in my veins and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Markin cut off as the door here before me flew open and a gaunt man
  stepped through into the scene, a revolver clutched in his lifting hand.</p>

  <p>"Franz!" Elsa exclaimed but the shots crashed in a single report. The
  captain turned. Franz folded, clutching his chest.</p>

  <p>A scream shrilled from the audience, a shout husky with terror. Ushers
  were running down the aisle to where a man had jumped up and was pointing
  with shaking hand at the seat in which I should be sitting.</p>

  <p>I stood on a stage abruptly bare again. The figures that had occupied it
  had vanished. Robin Adlair stepped out of the other wing, stared out into the
  auditorium at the front row seat, the bright pleon(?) of whose back was gashed by
  the bullet that had ploughed into it and, had I been sitting there, would
  have smashed into my chest instead.</p>
  <hr>
  <a name="ch-04"
        id="ch-04"></a>

  <h2>IV. &mdash; NINE-FOLD KILLING</h2>

  <p class="first">OTHERS were not as fortunate as I. In Chicago, in London, in
  Rio de Janeiro, in each of the theaters where a fascinated audience had
  watched the premiere performance of a Multidrama, a bullet had ploughed into
  the occupant of seat A-1. A single shot, fired from a single stage had slain
  nine men in nine separate cities scattered over half the world.</p>

  <p>"One of the strange features of this case," Rand Pardeen said later, "is
  that our examination of the guns used in the play disclosed that only blanks
  were fired from them." Burly, rock-jawed and steel-eyed, the Chief Inspector
  of UN's World Police had requested me to assemble in his office all of us who
  were primarily responsible for the Multidram; Malvin and Sherry Parker, Bart
  Murtry, Robin Adlair. "No molecules of lead were found in the barrel of the
  one fired in Los Angeles by the actor who played Franz, or of that which the
  character of Captain Markin shot off in London."</p>

  <p>"How about the bullets?" Sherry asked. None of us looked particularly
  chipper but she seemed especially worn, probably from the strain of stepping
  into the role of Elsa when Lilli Denton was taken suddenly ill the very
  morning of the performance. "I&mdash;" she smiled wanly. "I have a secret
  vice, inspector. I once found a collection of ancient detective books Dad
  made when he was a boy and I've read them all. According to them, the police
  always extract the murder bullet from the corpse and examine it to find out
  from what gun it came."</p>

  <p>Pardeen appeared grimly amused. "Quite right, Miss Parker. We should have
  done exactly that except for another odd circumstance. The surgeons who
  performed the autopsies on the bodies of the nine murdered men found no
  bullet in any of them."</p>

  <p>The stir this announcement evoked gave me a chance to glance again at the
  gray little man who sat inconspicuously in a corner, nursing a brief case.
  Why was Maxwell Hanscom here? Why should the UN Securities Control Board be
  represented at the investigation of a crime?</p>

  <p>"Your people must have slipped up somehow, Mr. Pardeen," Mal Parker was
  saying. "Nine of the slugs obviously were material images which were
  dissipated the instant I pulled the master switch in Chicago, shutting down
  the network, but there must have been a real prototype that continued to
  exist. You should have found it."</p>

  <p>"We did," Pardeen replied. "We found it, not buried in the chest of any of
  the dead men, but in the upholstery of the seat Mr. Loring would have
  occupied had he not so opportunely decided to go backstage."</p>

  <p>My fingers closed on my chair's arms so tightly the edges dug into flesh.
  "The actual shot was fired in New York, then. It was meant for me. I was the
  one the murderer was after."</p>

  <p>"So it would seem, Mr. Loring. The killer knew where you would be seated.
  He knew there was a moment in the play when the sound of his shot would be
  covered by shots on the stage. Apparently he did not know his missile would
  be reproduced so that it would kill nine others, and that seems to eliminate
  all of you who are familiar with the mechanics of this thing."</p>

  <p>"I disagree, Inspector." Pardeen's gray eyes moved to Murtry, who went on,
  "It eliminates none of us."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Pardeen stared at Murtry with somber interest. "You suggest that the
  slayer didn't care how many others died as long as his shot reached his
  intended victim?"</p>

  <p>"I do not. I mean that as far as any of us knew, no one but Mr. Loring
  would be reached by a shot fired at him from the New York stage. The
  Multidram receiver and transmitter fields were supposed to end sharply at the
  outer edge of the orchestra pits. If that had been the case, only the actual
  bullet would have passed beyond the vertical plane of the brass rail that
  edged the pit."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Bart," Robin Adlair drawled. "A very sound point&mdash;and an
  excellent red herring."</p>

  <p>"Red herring!" Murtry pushed up out of his chair, black eyes blazing.
  "What in blazes are you getting at?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever you want to make of it," the blond chap grinned, but his
  implication was clear. A clever killer well might try to avert suspicion from
  himself by disputing a theory that seemed to exculpate him from suspicion.
  "I'm curious about one thing, though. What makes you so sure the shot came
  from the stage?"</p>

  <p>The other's lips pulled back from his teeth in what he might have meant
  for a smile but was more like a snarl. "That's obvious to anyone but a moron,
  or someone who'd like to have us think it was fired from somewhere else.
  Coming from anywhere in the auditorium it could not have struck the back of
  the seat." The smoldering antagonism founded in their rivalry for Sherry was
  no longer covert but had flared into an open feud.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, Mr. Robin Adlair," Murtry purred, "that you've more
  reason to draw herrings across the trail than I."</p>

  <p>I could read Pardeen's mind as he glanced from one to the other. "Keep up
  the squabble, boys," he was thinking, "and maybe one of you will drop the
  clue I'm looking for."</p>

  <p>"I seem to recall," Murtry continued, "that when the lights went on you
  were standing there on the New York stage."</p>

  <p>"Right." The blonde giant grinned. "I figured on getting to the New York
  Bijou in time to check the set, but the crowd outside held me up and I got
  inside the entrance, which is on the right of the house, just as the lights
  were dimming. I thought I could still make it but was caught on the right of
  the stage by the curtain going up, couldn't cross without exposing
  myself."</p>

  <p>"You were delayed, all right," Murtry snapped back at him. "You reached
  the wings just as the actors were about to fire their blanks and you had to
  get off your own shot so fast that you didn't notice Mr. Loring wasn't where
  he was supposed to be."</p>

  <p>He'd slipped the noose around Adlair's neck as neatly as I could have.</p>

  <p>"No, Robin," Sherry moaned. "No. You couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, kitten, I could." The fellow seemed oddly unperturbed. "Our Bart has
  built up a swell case against me. Hasn't he, Inspector?" He transferred his
  lazy grin to Pardeen. "Almost as good a case as you had when you were about
  to arrest me. And it suffers from the same defect."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it does," the law officer agreed. "You see, Mr. Murtry, the
  weapon whose rifling the murder bullet matches was found some ten minutes
  after the shot was fired and while Mr. Adlair still was in the custody of the
  New York police, on the stage of the Chicago theater."</p>

  <p>That really was a crusher. Eyes met widening eyes in puzzlement, breaths
  sighed in an almost eerie hush which was broken by Adlair's chuckle. "Maybe
  you can figure that one out. Bart."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I can." Murtry wasn't beaten yet. "In fact, I know that answer.
  What you did was to cache your gun in Chicago, within the area the receiver
  there would scan. When the Multidram was switched on, it was reproduced at
  the same spot on all the stage. You picked up its material image in New York,
  loaded it with a real cartridge which in turn was recreated in the other nine
  theaters and fired it."</p>

  <p>"Doctor Parker turned off the current and presto!&mdash;no gun on you,
  nothing to connect you with the gun in Chicago. Except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was he who grinned now, triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Except, Inspector Pardeen, that the flashback of powder gases from the
  real cartridge will have left their mark on the skin of his right hand."</p>

  <p>"Good boy!" The inspector jumped up. "That does it. We'll apply the wax
  test, right here and now." He strode to the door, jerked it open. "Jenkins,"
  he called. "Ashkinazy. I've got a little job for you."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>There was a muttered conference at the door, a wait, then two uniformed
  men came in carrying a tray with some simple apparatus on it. As, still
  smiling but a little uneasily, Robin Adlair submitted to their ministrations
  the man from the UN spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>"You know, Inspector Pardeen, there's something about this that still
  bothers me."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Why the Multidram field was enlarged to include Mr. Loring's seat. There
  doesn't seem to have been any reason for that."</p>

  <p>Pardeen looked at Murtry but I answered for him. "Does there have to be a
  reason, Mr. Hanscom? I imagine it was a slight, if unfortunate misadjustment
  of the control apparatus in Chicago. After all, Mr. Parker was undoubtedly a
  little excited over the first public test of his new invention
  and&mdash;well, he isn't as young as he used to be."</p>

  <p>"Meaning that I'm superannuated, Billiken?" Mal Parker demanded,
  bristling. "Why don't you pension me off, if that's the case?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I will, Mal," I couldn't resist responding. "Remind me to
  consider it after your protege has been properly taken care of."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Loring," Hanscom intervened. "I don't want to seem
  persistent but I can't help wondering if the misadjustment need necessarily
  have been made at the central controls in Chicago."</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Hanscom," I flared. "What right have you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, Billiken," Mal Parker interrupted me. "Since that concerns
  me directly, I'd like to clear it up. The answer to your question, Mr.
  Hanscom, is that all ten Multidram transceivers were electronically
  interlocked so as to avoid the possibility of overlapping or other faulty
  registry. A change in the adjustment of any one would affect them all. Look.
  I'll draw you a diagram that will make it clear. May I have a paper and
  pencil, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>Pardeen started to fish in his pocket, turned to the slender,
  sharp-featured officer who approached him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ashkinazy, what have you got?"</p>

  <p>Mask-faced, the chap held out a crinkling film of wax.</p>

  <p>"Look for yourself, sir." It showed the roughnesses of Adlair's skin, and
  nothing else. "That guy didn't shoot off any gun in the last twenty-four
  hours, not with either hand."</p>

  <p>There was a small, hawking sound in Bart Murtry's throat, from Sherry
  Parker a glad cry as she flew to the blond giant.</p>

  <p>"I knew it, Robin. I knew you didn't do it."</p>

  <p>"So did I, honey," he grinned as he caught her and held her. "But someone
  did. I wonder if it wasn't the one who tried to fasten it on me." His broad
  face was abruptly grim. "I suggest, Inspector, that you submit Bart Murtry to
  this same test."</p>

  <p>"Why Murtry?" Maxwell Hanscom asked. "We have absolute proof that he was
  in London at the time of the murders." He seemed suddenly to have taken over
  command of the proceedings and the frightening thing was that Pardeen let
  him. "Why not Billingsley Loring?"</p>

  <p>"That's absurd!" I flared. "Are you intimating that I tried to murder
  myself, Mr. Hanscom?"</p>

  <p>He turned those penetrating cold gray eyes on me;</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Loring. I'm simply recalling that like Mr. Adlair, you were on
  the stage of the New York theater in position to fire the real bullet in the
  imaged gun. In position also, as Mr. Adlair was not, to have made the slight
  change in the transceiver's setting that resulted in the death of the nine
  men to whom you'd sent tickets to seat A-one. The same nine men who brought
  against you the charges I've been investigating of fraudulent operation of
  corporations whose stock they bought from you, and without whose evidence the
  charges must be dropped."</p>

  <p>Inspector Pardeen was coming toward me and his uniformed aides were
  closing in on me from either side but I saw only Neva's shocked eyes, Neva's
  color-drained, cameo features.</p>

  <p>"No," Neva's daughter whispered. "No, Uncle Billiken. You couldn't
  have."</p>

  <p>But I had. It was the only way I could have saved the great commercial
  empire I'd slaved for years to build. What were the lives of nine
  money-grubbers against that?</p>
