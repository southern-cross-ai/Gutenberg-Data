<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SINCE earliest childhood I have been strangely
fascinated by the mystery surrounding the history of the last days
of twentieth century Europe. My interest is keenest, perhaps, not
so much in relation to known facts as to speculation upon the
unknowable of the two centuries that have rolled by since human
intercourse between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres
ceased&mdash;the mystery of Europe's state following the
termination of the Great War&mdash;provided, of course, that the
war had been terminated.</p>

<p>From out of the meagerness of our censored histories we learned
that for fifteen years after the cessation of diplomatic relations
between the United States of North America and the belligerent
nations of the Old World, news of more or less doubtful
authenticity filtered, from time to time, into the Western
Hemisphere from the Eastern.</p>

<p>Then came the fruition of that historic propaganda which is best
described by its own slogan: "The East for the East&mdash;the West
for the West," and all further intercourse was stopped by
statute.</p>

<p>Even prior to this, transoceanic commerce had practically
ceased, owing to the perils and hazards of the mine-strewn waters
of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Just when submarine
activities ended we do not know but the last vessel of this type
sighted by a Pan-American merchantman was the huge Q 138, which
discharged twenty-nine torpedoes at a Brazilian tank steamer off
the Bermudas in the fall of 1972. A heavy sea and the excellent
seamanship of the master of the Brazilian permitted the
Pan-American to escape and report this last of a long series of
outrages upon our commerce. God alone knows how many hundreds of
our ancient ships fell prey to the roving steel sharks of
blood-frenzied Europe. Countless were the vessels and men that
passed over our eastern and western horizons never to return; but
whether they met their fates before the belching tubes of
submarines or among the aimlessly drifting mine fields, no man
lived to tell.</p>

<p>And then came the great Pan-American Federation which linked the
Western Hemisphere from pole to pole under a single flag, which
joined the navies of the New World into the mightiest fighting
force that ever sailed the seven seas&mdash;the greatest argument
for peace the world had ever known.</p>

<p>Since that day peace had reigned from the western shores of the
Azores to the western shores of the Hawaiian Islands, nor has any
man of either hemisphere dared cross 30�W. or 175�W. From 30� to
175� is ours&mdash;from 30� to 175� is peace, prosperity and
happiness.</p>

<p>Beyond was the great unknown. Even the geographies of my boyhood
showed nothing beyond. We were taught of nothing beyond.
Speculation was discouraged. For two hundred years the Eastern
Hemisphere had been wiped from the maps and histories of
Pan-America. Its mention in fiction, even, was forbidden.</p>

<p>Our ships of peace patrol thirty and one hundred seventy-five.
What ships from beyond they have warned only the secret archives of
government show; but, a naval officer myself, I have gathered from
the traditions of the service that it has been fully two hundred
years since smoke or sail has been sighted east of 30� or west of
175�. The fate of the relinquished provinces which lay beyond the
dead lines we could only speculate upon. That they were taken by
the military power, which rose so suddenly in China after the fall
of the republic, and which wrested Manchuria and Korea from Russia
and Japan, and also absorbed the Philippines, is quite within the
range of possibility.</p>

<p>It was the commander of a Chinese man-of-war who received a copy
of the edict of 1972 from the hand of my illustrious ancestor,
Admiral Turck, on one hundred seventy-five, two hundred and six
years ago, and from the yellowed pages of the admiral's diary I
learned that the fate of the Philippines was even then presaged by
these Chinese naval officers.</p>

<p>Yes, for over two hundred years no man crossed 30� to 175� and
lived to tell his story&mdash;not until chance drew me across and
back again, and public opinion, revolting at last against the
drastic regulations of our long-dead forbears, demanded that my
story be given to the world, and that the narrow interdict which
commanded peace, prosperity, and happiness to halt at 30� and 175�
be removed forever.</p>

<p>I am glad that it was given to me to be an instrument in the
hands of Providence for the uplifting of benighted Europe, and the
amelioration of the suffering, degradation, and abysmal ignorance
in which I found her.</p>

<p>I shall not live to see the complete regeneration of the savage
hordes of the Eastern Hemisphere&mdash;that is a work which will
require many generations, perhaps ages, so complete has been their
reversion to savagery; but I know that the work has been started,
and I am proud of the share in it which my generous countrymen have
placed in my hands.</p>

<p>The government already possesses a complete official report of
my adventures beyond thirty. In the narrative I purpose telling my
story in a less formal, and I hope, a more entertaining, style;
though, being only a naval officer and without claim to the
slightest literary ability, I shall most certainly fall far short
of the possibilities which are inherent in my subject. That I have
passed through the most wondrous adventures that have befallen a
civilized man during the past two centuries encourages me in the
belief that, however ill the telling, the facts themselves will
command your interest to the final page.</p>

<p>Beyond thirty! Romance, adventure, strange peoples, fearsome
beasts&mdash;all the excitement and scurry of the lives of the
twentieth century ancients that have been denied us in these dull
days of peace and prosaic prosperity&mdash;all, all lay beyond
thirty, the invisible barrier between the stupid, commercial
present and the carefree, barbarous past.</p>

<p>What boy has not sighed for the good old days of wars,
revolutions, and riots; how I used to pore over the chronicles of
those old days, those dear old days, when workmen went armed to
their labors; when they fell upon one another with gun and bomb and
dagger, and the streets ran red with blood! Ah, but those were the
times when life was worth the living; when a man who went out by
night knew not at which dark corner a "footpad" might leap upon and
slay him; when wild beasts roamed the forest and the jungles, and
there were savage men, and countries yet unexplored.</p>

<p>Now, in all the Western Hemisphere dwells no man who may not
find a school house within walking distance of his home, or at
least within flying distance.</p>

<p>The wildest beast that roams our waste places lairs in the
frozen north or the frozen south within a government reserve, where
the curious may view him and feed him bread crusts from the hand
with perfect impunity.</p>

<p>But beyond thirty! And I have gone there, and come back; and now
you may go there, for no longer is it high treason, punishable by
disgrace or death, to cross 30� or 175�.</p>

<p>My name is Jefferson Turck. I am a lieutenant in the
navy&mdash;in the great Pan-American navy, the only navy which now
exists in all the world.</p>

<p>I was born in Arizona, in the United States of North America, in
the year of our Lord 2116. Therefore, I am twenty-one years
old.</p>

<p>In early boyhood I tired of the teeming cities and overcrowded
rural districts of Arizona. Every generation of Turcks for over two
centuries has been represented in the navy. The navy called to me,
as did the free, wide, unpeopled spaces of the mighty oceans. And
so I joined the navy, coming up from the ranks, as we all must,
learning our craft as we advance. My promotion was rapid, for my
family seems to inherit naval lore. We are born officers, and I
reserve to myself no special credit for an early advancement in the
service.</p>

<p>At twenty I found myself a lieutenant in command of the
aero-submarine <i>Coldwater</i>, of the SS-96 class. The
<i>Coldwater</i> was one of the first of the air and underwater
craft which have been so greatly improved since its launching, and
was possessed of innumerable weaknesses which, fortunately, have
been eliminated in more recent vessels of similar type.</p>

<p>Even when I took command, she was fit only for the junk pile;
but the world-old parsimony of government retained her in active
service, and sent two hundred men to sea in her, with myself, a
mere boy, in command of her, to patrol thirty from Iceland to the
Azores.</p>

<p>Much of my service had been spent aboard the great
merchantmen-of-war. These are the utility naval vessels that have
transformed the navies of old, which burdened the peoples with
taxes for their support, into the present day fleets of
self-supporting ships that find ample time for target practice and
gun drill while they bear freight and the mails from the continents
to the far-scattered island of Pan-America.</p>

<p>This change in service was most welcome to me, especially as it
brought with it coveted responsibilities of sole command, and I was
prone to overlook the deficiencies of the <i>Coldwater</i> in the
natural pride I felt in my first ship.</p>

<p>The <i>Coldwater</i> was fully equipped for two months'
patrolling&mdash;the ordinary length of assignment to this
service&mdash;and a month had already passed, its monotony entirely
unrelieved by sight of another craft, when the first of our
misfortunes befell.</p>

<p>We had been riding out a storm at an altitude of about three
thousand feet. All night we had hovered above the tossing billows
of the moonlight clouds. The detonation of the thunder and the
glare of lightning through an occasional rift in the vaporous wall
proclaimed the continued fury of the tempest upon the surface of
the sea; but we, far above it all, rode in comparative ease upon
the upper gale. With the coming of dawn the clouds beneath us
became a glorious sea of gold and silver, soft and beautiful; but
they could not deceive us as to the blackness and the terrors of
the storm-lashed ocean which they hid.</p>

<p>I was at breakfast when my chief engineer entered and saluted.
His face was grave, and I thought he was even a trifle paler than
usual.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>He drew the back of his forefinger nervously across his brow in
a gesture that was habitual with him in moments of mental
stress.</p>

<p>"The gravitation-screen generators, sir," he said. "Number one
went to the bad about an hour and a half ago. We have been working
upon it steadily since; but I have to report, sir, that it is
beyond repair."</p>

<p>"Number two will keep us supplied," I answered. "In the meantime
we will send a wireless for relief."</p>

<p>"But that is the trouble, sir," he went on. "Number two has
stopped. I knew it would come, sir. I made a report on these
generators three years ago. I advised then that they both be
scrapped. Their principle is entirely wrong. They're done for."
And, with a grim smile, "I shall at least have the satisfaction of
knowing my report was accurate."</p>

<p>"Have we sufficient reserve screen to permit us to make land,
or, at least, meet our relief halfway?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he replied gravely; "we are sinking now."</p>

<p>"Have you anything further to report?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Very good," I replied; and, as I dismissed him, I rang for my
wireless operator. When he appeared, I gave him a message to the
secretary of the navy, to whom all vessels in service on thirty and
one hundred seventy-five report direct. I explained our
predicament, and stated that with what screening force remained I
should continue in the air, making as rapid headway toward St.
Johns as possible, and that when we were forced to take to the
water I should continue in the same direction.</p>

<p>The accident occurred directly over 30� and about 52� N. The
surface wind was blowing a tempest from the west. To attempt to
ride out such a storm upon the surface seemed suicidal, for the
<i>Coldwater</i> was not designed for surface navigation except
under fair weather conditions. Submerged, or in the air, she was
tractable enough in any sort of weather when under control; but
without her screen generators she was almost helpless, since she
could not fly, and, if submerged, could not rise to the
surface.</p>

<p>All these defects have been remedied in later models; but the
knowledge did not help us any that day aboard the slowly settling
<i>Coldwater</i>, with an angry sea roaring beneath, a tempest
raging out of the west, and 30� only a few knots astern.</p>

<p>To cross thirty or one hundred seventy-five has been, as you
know, the direst calamity that could befall a naval commander.
Court-martial and degradation follow swiftly, unless as is often
the case, the unfortunate man takes his own life before this unjust
and heartless regulation can hold him up to public scorn.</p>

<p>There has been in the past no excuse, no circumstance, that
could palliate the offense.</p>

<p>"He was in command, and he took his ship across thirty!" That
was sufficient. It might not have been in any way his fault, as, in
the case of the <i>Coldwater</i>, it could not possibly have been
justly charged to my account that the gravitation-screen generators
were worthless; but well I knew that should chance have it that we
were blown across thirty today&mdash;as we might easily be before
the terrific west wind that we could hear howling below us, the
responsibility would fall upon my shoulders.</p>

<p>In a way, the regulation was a good one, for it certainly
accomplished that for which it was intended. We all fought shy of
30� on the east and 175� on the west, and, though we had to skirt
them pretty close, nothing but an act of God ever drew one of us
across. You all are familiar with the naval tradition that a good
officer could sense proximity to either line, and for my part, I am
firmly convinced of the truth of this as I am that the compass
finds the north without recourse to tedious processes of
reasoning.</p>

<p>Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to maintain that he could smell
thirty, and the men of the first ship in which I sailed claimed
that Coburn, the navigating officer, knew by name every wave along
thirty from 60�N. to 60�S. However, I'd hate to vouch for this.</p>

<p>Well, to get back to my narrative; we kept on dropping slowly
toward the surface the while we bucked the west wind, clawing away
from thirty as fast as we could. I was on the bridge, and as we
dropped from the brilliant sunlight into the dense vapor of clouds
and on down through them to the wild, dark storm strata beneath, it
seemed that my spirits dropped with the falling ship, and the
buoyancy of hope ran low in sympathy.</p>

<p>The waves were running to tremendous heights, and the
<i>Coldwater</i> was not designed to meet such waves head on. Her
elements were the blue ether, far above the raging storm, or the
greater depths of ocean, which no storm could ruffle.</p>

<p>As I stood speculating upon our chances once we settled into the
frightful Maelstrom beneath us and at the same time mentally
computing the hours which must elapse before aid could reach us,
the wireless operator clambered up the ladder to the bridge, and,
disheveled and breathless, stood before me at salute. It needed but
a glance at him to assure me that something was amiss.</p>

<p>"What now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The wireless, sir!" he cried. "My God, sir, I cannot send."</p>

<p>"But the emergency outfit?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have tried everything, sir. I have exhausted every resource.
We cannot send," and he drew himself up and saluted again.</p>

<p>I dismissed him with a few kind words, for I knew that it was
through no fault of his that the mechanism was antiquated and
worthless, in common with the balance of the <i>Coldwater</i>'s
equipment. There was no finer operator in Pan-America than he.</p>

<p>The failure of the wireless did not appear as momentous to me as
to him, which is not unnatural, since it is but human to feel that
when our own little cog slips, the entire universe must necessarily
be put out of gear. I knew that if this storm were destined to blow
us across thirty, or send us to the bottom of the ocean, no help
could reach us in time to prevent it. I had ordered the message
sent solely because regulations required it, and not with any
particular hope that we could benefit by it in our present
extremity.</p>

<p>I had little time to dwell upon the coincidence of the
simultaneous failure of the wireless and the buoyancy generators,
since very shortly after the <i>Coldwater</i> had dropped so low
over the waters that all my attention was necessarily centered upon
the delicate business of settling upon the waves without breaking
my ship's back. With our buoyancy generators in commission it would
have been a simple thing to enter the water, since then it would
have been but a trifling matter of a forty-five degree dive into
the base of a huge wave. We should have cut into the water like a
hot knife through butter, and have been totally submerged with
scarce a jar&mdash;I have done it a thousand times&mdash;but I did
not dare submerge the <i>Coldwater</i> for fear that it would
remain submerged to the end of time&mdash;a condition far from
conducive to the longevity of commander or crew.</p>

<p>Most of my officers were older men than I. John Alvarez, my
first officer, is twenty years my senior. He stood at my side on
the bridge as the ship glided closer and closer to those stupendous
waves. He watched my every move, but he was by far too fine an
officer and gentleman to embarrass me by either comment or
suggestion.</p>

<p>When I saw that we soon would touch, I ordered the ship brought
around broadside to the wind, and there we hovered a moment until a
huge wave reached up and seized us upon its crest, and then I gave
the order that suddenly reversed the screening force, and let us
into the ocean. Down into the trough we went, wallowing like the
carcass of a dead whale, and then began the fight, with rudder and
propellers, to force the <i>Coldwater</i> back into the teeth of
the gale and drive her on and on, farther and farther from
relentless thirty.</p>

<p>I think that we should have succeeded, even though the ship was
wracked from stem to stern by the terrific buffetings she received,
and though she were half submerged the greater part of the time,
had no further accident befallen us.</p>

<p>We were making headway, though slowly, and it began to look as
though we were going to pull through. Alvarez never left my side,
though I all but ordered him below for much-needed rest. My second
officer, Porfirio Johnson, was also often on the bridge. He was a
good officer, but a man for whom I had conceived a rather
unreasoning aversion almost at the first moment of meeting him, an
aversion which was not lessened by the knowledge which I
subsequently gained that he looked upon my rapid promotion with
jealousy. He was ten years my senior both in years and service, and
I rather think he could never forget the fact that he had been an
officer when I was a green apprentice.</p>

<p>As it became more and more apparent that the <i>Coldwater</i>,
under my seamanship, was weathering the tempest and giving promise
of pulling through safely, I could have sworn that I perceived a
shade of annoyance and disappointment growing upon his dark
countenance. He left the bridge finally and went below. I do not
know that he is directly responsible for what followed so shortly
after; but I have always had my suspicions, and Alvarez is even
more prone to place the blame upon him than I.</p>

<p>It was about six bells of the forenoon watch that Johnson
returned to the bridge after an absence of some thirty minutes. He
seemed nervous and ill at ease&mdash;a fact which made little
impression on me at the time, but which both Alvarez and I recalled
subsequently.</p>

<p>Not three minutes after his reappearance at my side the
<i>Coldwater</i> suddenly commenced to lose headway. I seized the
telephone at my elbow, pressing upon the button which would call
the chief engineer to the instrument in the bowels of the ship,
only to find him already at the receiver attempting to reach
me.</p>

<p>"Numbers one, two, and five engines have broken down, sir," he
called. "Shall we force the remaining three?"</p>

<p>"We can do nothing else," I bellowed into the transmitter.</p>

<p>"They won't stand the gaff, sir," he returned.</p>

<p>"Can you suggest a better plan?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then give them the gaff, lieutenant," I shouted back, and hung
up the receiver.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes the <i>Coldwater</i> bucked the great seas
with her three engines. I doubt if she advanced a foot; but it was
enough to keep her nose in the wind, and, at least, we were not
drifting toward thirty.</p>

<p>Johnson and Alvarez were at my side when, without warning, the
bow swung swiftly around and the ship fell into the trough of the
sea.</p>

<p>"The other three have gone," I said, and I happened to be
looking at Johnson as I spoke. Was it the shadow of a satisfied
smile that crossed his thin lips? I do not know; but at least he
did not weep.</p>

<p>"You always have been curious, sir, about the great unknown
beyond thirty," he said. "You are in a good way to have your
curiosity satisfied." And then I could not mistake the slight sneer
that curved his upper lip. There must have been a trace of
disrespect in his tone or manner which escaped me, for Alvarez
turned upon him like a flash.</p>

<p>"When Lieutenant Turck crosses thirty," he said, "we shall all
cross with him, and God help the officer or the man who reproaches
him!"</p>

<p>"I shall not be a party to high treason," snapped Johnson. "The
regulations are explicit, and if the <i>Coldwater</i> crosses
thirty it devolves upon you to place Lieutenant Turck under arrest
and immediately exert every endeavor to bring the ship back into
Pan-American waters."</p>

<p>"I shall not know," replied Alvarez, "that the <i>Coldwater</i>
passes thirty; nor shall any other man aboard know it," and, with
his words, he drew a revolver from his pocket, and before either I
or Johnson could prevent it had put a bullet into every instrument
upon the bridge, ruining them beyond repair.</p>

<p>And then he saluted me, and strode from the bridge, a martyr to
loyalty and friendship, for, though no man might know that
Lieutenant Jefferson Turck had taken his ship across thirty, every
man aboard would know that the first officer had committed a crime
that was punishable by both degradation and death. Johnson turned
and eyed me narrowly.</p>

<p>"Shall I place him under arrest?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You shall not," I replied. "Nor shall anyone else."</p>

<p>"You become a party to his crime!" he cried angrily.</p>

<p>"You may go below, Mr. Johnson," I said, "and attend to the work
of unpacking the extra instruments and having them properly set
upon the bridge."</p>

<p>He saluted, and left me, and for some time I stood, gazing out
upon the angry waters, my mind filled with unhappy reflections upon
the unjust fate that had overtaken me, and the sorrow and disgrace
that I had unwittingly brought down upon my house.</p>

<p>I rejoiced that I should leave neither wife nor child to bear
the burden of my shame throughout their lives.</p>

<p>As I thought upon my misfortune, I considered more clearly than
ever before the unrighteousness of the regulation which was to
prove my doom, and in the natural revolt against its injustice my
anger rose, and there mounted within me a feeling which I imagine
must have paralleled that spirit that once was prevalent among the
ancients called anarchy.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life I found my sentiments arraying
themselves against custom, tradition, and even government. The wave
of rebellion swept over me in an instant, beginning with an
heretical doubt as to the sanctity of the established order of
things&mdash;that fetish which has ruled Pan-Americans for two
centuries, and which is based upon a blind faith in the
infallibility of the prescience of the long-dead framers of the
articles of Pan-American federation&mdash;and ending in an
adamantine determination to defend my honor and my life to the last
ditch against the blind and senseless regulation which assumed the
synonymity of misfortune and treason.</p>

<p>I would replace the destroyed instruments upon the bridge; every
officer and man should know when we crossed thirty. But then I
should assert the spirit which dominated me, I should resist
arrest, and insist upon bringing my ship back across the dead line,
remaining at my post until we had reached New York. Then I should
make a full report, and with it a demand upon public opinion that
the dead lines be wiped forever from the seas.</p>

<p>I knew that I was right. I knew that no more loyal officer wore
the uniform of the navy. I knew that I was a good officer and
sailor, and I didn't propose submitting to degradation and
discharge because a lot of old, preglacial fossils had declared
over two hundred years before that no man should cross thirty.</p>

<p>Even while these thoughts were passing through my mind I was
busy with the details of my duties. I had seen to it that a sea
anchor was rigged, and even now the men had completed their task,
and the <i>Coldwater</i> was swinging around rapidly, her nose
pointing once more into the wind, and the frightful rolling
consequent upon her wallowing in the trough was happily
diminishing.</p>

<p>It was then that Johnson came hurrying to the bridge. One of his
eyes was swollen and already darkening, and his lip was cut and
bleeding. Without even the formality of a salute, he burst upon me,
white with fury.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Alvarez attacked me!" he cried. "I demand that he be
placed under arrest. I found him in the act of destroying the
reserve instruments, and when I would have interfered to protect
them he fell upon me and beat me. I demand that you arrest
him!"</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, Mr. Johnson," I said. "You are not in
command of the ship. I deplore the action of Lieutenant Alvarez,
but I cannot expunge from my mind the loyalty and self-sacrificing
friendship which has prompted him to his acts. Were I you, sir, I
should profit by the example he has set. Further, Mr. Johnson, I
intend retaining command of the ship, even though she crosses
thirty, and I shall demand implicit obedience from every officer
and man aboard until I am properly relieved from duty by a superior
officer in the port of New York."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that you will cross thirty without submitting
to arrest?" he almost shouted.</p>

<p>"I do, sir," I replied. "And now you may go below, and, when
again you find it necessary to address me, you will please be so
good as to bear in mind the fact that I am your commanding officer,
and as such entitled to a salute."</p>

<p>He flushed, hesitated a moment, and then, saluting, turned upon
his heel and left the bridge. Shortly after, Alvarez appeared. He
was pale, and seemed to have aged ten years in the few brief
minutes since I last had seen him. Saluting, he told me very simply
what he had done, and asked that I place him under arrest.</p>

<p>I put my hand on his shoulder, and I guess that my voice
trembled a trifle as, while reproving him for his act, I made it
plain to him that my gratitude was no less potent a force than his
loyalty to me. Then it was that I outlined to him my purpose to
defy the regulation that had raised the dead lines, and to take my
ship back to New York myself.</p>

<p>I did not ask him to share the responsibility with me. I merely
stated that I should refuse to submit to arrest, and that I should
demand of him and every other officer and man implicit obedience to
my every command until we docked at home.</p>

<p>His face brightened at my words, and he assured me that I would
find him as ready to acknowledge my command upon the wrong side of
thirty as upon the right, an assurance which I hastened to tell him
I did not need.</p>

<p>The storm continued to rage for three days, and as far as the
wind scarce varied a point during all that time, I knew that we
must be far beyond thirty, drifting rapidly east by south. All this
time it had been impossible to work upon the damaged engines or the
gravity-screen generators; but we had a full set of instruments
upon the bridge, for Alvarez, after discovering my intentions, had
fetched the reserve instruments from his own cabin, where he had
hidden them. Those which Johnson had seen him destroy had been a
third set which only Alvarez had known was aboard the
<i>Coldwater</i>.</p>

<p>We waited impatiently for the sun, that we might determine our
exact location, and upon the fourth day our vigil was rewarded a
few minutes before noon.</p>

<p>Every officer and man aboard was tense with nervous excitement
as we awaited the result of the reading. The crew had known almost
as soon as I that we were doomed to cross thirty, and I am inclined
to believe that every man jack of them was tickled to death, for
the spirits of adventure and romance still live in the hearts of
men of the twenty-second century, even though there be little for
them to feed upon between thirty and one hundred seventy-five.</p>

<p>The men carried none of the burdens of responsibility. They
might cross thirty with impunity, and doubtless they would return
to be heroes at home; but how different the homecoming of their
commanding officer!</p>

<p>The wind had dropped to a steady blow, still from west by north,
and the sea had gone down correspondingly. The crew, with the
exception of those whose duties kept them below, were ranged on
deck below the bridge. When our position was definitely fixed I
personally announced it to the eager, waiting men.</p>

<p>"Men," I said, stepping forward to the handrail and looking down
into their upturned, bronzed faces, "you are anxiously awaiting
information as to the ship's position. It has been determined at
latitude fifty degrees seven minutes north, longitude twenty
degrees sixteen minutes west."</p>

<p>I paused and a buzz of animated comment ran through the massed
men beneath me. "Beyond thirty. But there will be no change in
commanding officers, in routine or in discipline, until after we
have docked again in New York."</p>

<p>As I ceased speaking and stepped back from the rail there was a
roar of applause from the deck such as I never before had heard
aboard a ship of peace. It recalled to my mind tales that I had
read of the good old days when naval vessels were built to fight,
when ships of peace had been man-of-war, and guns had flashed in
other than futile target practice, and decks had run red with
blood.</p>

<p>With the subsistence of the sea, we were able to go to work upon
the damaged engines to some effect, and I also set men to examining
the gravitation-screen generators with a view to putting them in
working order should it prove not beyond our resources.</p>

<p>For two weeks we labored at the engines, which indisputably
showed evidence of having been tampered with. I appointed a board
to investigate and report upon the disaster. But it accomplished
nothing other than to convince me that there were several officers
upon it who were in full sympathy with Johnson, for, though no
charges had been preferred against him, the board went out of its
way specifically to exonerate him in its findings.</p>

<p>All this time we were drifting almost due east. The work upon
the engines had progressed to such an extent that within a few
hours we might expect to be able to proceed under our own power
westward in the direction of Pan-American waters.</p>

<p>To relieve the monotony I had taken to fishing, and early that
morning I had departed from the <i>Coldwater</i> in one of the
boats on such an excursion. A gentle west wind was blowing. The sea
shimmered in the sunlight. A cloudless sky canopied the west for
our sport, as I had made it a point never voluntarily to make an
inch toward the east that I could avoid. At least, they should not
be able to charge me with a willful violation of the dead lines
regulation.</p>

<p>I had with me only the boat's ordinary complement of
men&mdash;three in all, and more than enough to handle any small
power boat. I had not asked any of my officers to accompany me, as
I wished to be alone, and very glad am I now that I had not. My
only regret is that, in view of what befell us, it had been
necessary to bring the three brave fellows who manned the boat.</p>

<p>Our fishing, which proved excellent, carried us so far to the
west that we no longer could see the <i>Coldwater</i>. The day wore
on, until at last, about mid-afternoon, I gave the order to return
to the ship.</p>

<p>We had proceeded but a short distance toward the east when one
of the men gave an exclamation of excitement, at the same time
pointing eastward. We all looked on in the direction he had
indicated, and there, a short distance above the horizon, we saw
the outlines of the <i>Coldwater</i> silhouetted against the
sky.</p>

<p>"They've repaired the engines and the generators both,"
exclaimed one of the men.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible, but yet it had evidently been done. Only
that morning, Lieutenant Johnson had told me that he feared that it
would be impossible to repair the generators. I had put him in
charge of this work, since he always had been accounted one of the
best gravitation-screen men in the navy. He had invented several of
the improvements that are incorporated in the later models of these
generators, and I am convinced that he knows more concerning both
the theory and the practice of screening gravitation than any
living Pan-American.</p>

<p>At the sight of the <i>Coldwater</i> once more under control,
the three men burst into a glad cheer. But, for some reason which I
could not then account, I was strangely overcome by a premonition
of personal misfortune. It was not that I now anticipated an early
return to Pan-America and a board of inquiry, for I had rather
looked forward to the fight that must follow my return. No, there
was something else, something indefinable and vague that cast a
strange gloom upon me as I saw my ship rising farther above the
water and making straight in our direction.</p>

<p>I was not long in ascertaining a possible explanation of my
depression, for, though we were plainly visible from the bridge of
the aero-submarine and to the hundreds of men who swarmed her deck,
the ship passed directly above us, not five hundred feet from the
water, and sped directly westward.</p>

<p>We all shouted, and I fired my pistol to attract their
attention, though I knew full well that all who cared to had
observed us, but the ship moved steadily away, growing smaller and
smaller to our view until at last she passed completely out of
sight.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHAT could it mean? I had left Alvarez in command.
He was my most loyal subordinate. It was absolutely beyond the pale
of possibility that Alvarez should desert me. No, there was some
other explanation. Something occurred to place my second officer,
Porfirio Johnson, in command. I was sure of it but why speculate?
The futility of conjecture was only too palpable. The
<i>Coldwater</i> had abandoned us in mid-ocean. Doubtless none of
us would survive to know why.</p>

<p>The young man at the wheel of the power boat had turned her nose
about as it became evident that the ship intended passing over us,
and now he still held her in futile pursuit of the
<i>Coldwater</i>.</p>

<p>"Bring her about, Snider," I directed, "and hold her due east.
We can't catch the <i>Coldwater</i>, and we can't cross the
Atlantic in this. Our only hope lies in making the nearest land,
which, unless I am mistaken, is the Scilly Islands, off the
southwest coast of England. Ever heard of England, Snider?"</p>

<p>"There's a part of the United States of North America that used
to be known to the ancients as New England," he replied. "Is that
where you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, Snider," I replied. "The England I refer to was an island
off the continent of Europe. It was the seat of a very powerful
kingdom that flourished over two hundred years ago. A part of the
United States of North America and all of the Federated States of
Canada once belonged to this ancient England."</p>

<p>"Europe," breathed one of the men, his voice tense with
excitement. "My grandfather used to tell me stories of the world
beyond thirty. He had been a great student, and he had read much
from forbidden books."</p>

<p>"In which I resemble your grandfather," I said, "for I, too,
have read more even than naval officers are supposed to read, and,
as you men know, we are permitted a greater latitude in the study
of geography and history than men of other professions.</p>

<p>"Among the books and papers of Admiral Porter Turck, who lived
two hundred years ago, and from whom I am descended, many volumes
still exist, and are in my possession, which deal with the history
and geography of ancient Europe. Usually I bring several of these
books with me upon a cruise, and this time, among others, I have
maps of Europe and her surrounding waters. I was studying them as
we came away from the <i>Coldwater</i> this morning, and luckily I
have them with me."</p>

<p>"You are going to try to make Europe, sir?" asked Taylor, the
young man who had last spoken.</p>

<p>"It is the nearest land," I replied. "I have always wanted to
explore the forgotten lands of the Eastern Hemisphere. Here's our
chance. To remain at sea is to perish. None of us ever will see
home again. Let us make the best of it, and enjoy while we do live
that which is forbidden the balance of our race&mdash;the adventure
and the mystery which lie beyond thirty."</p>

<p>Taylor and Delcarte seized the spirit of my mood but Snider, I
think, was a trifle skeptical.</p>

<p>"It is treason, sir."</p>

<p>I replied, "but there is no law which compels us to visit
punishment upon ourselves. Could we return to Pan-America, I should
be the first to insist that we face it. But we know that's not
possible. Even if this craft would carry us so far, we haven't
enough water or food for more than three days.</p>

<p>"We are doomed, Snider, to die far from home and without ever
again looking upon the face of another fellow countryman than those
who sit here now in this boat. Isn't that punishment sufficient for
even the most exacting judge?"</p>

<p>Even Snider had to admit that it was.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, let us live while we live, and enjoy to the
fullest whatever of adventure or pleasure each new day brings,
since any day may be our last, and we shall be dead for a
considerable while."</p>

<p>I could see that Snider was still fearful, but Taylor and
Delcarte responded with a hearty, "Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>They were of different mold. Both were sons of naval officers.
They represented the aristocracy of birth, and they dared to think
for themselves.</p>

<p>Snider was in the minority, and so we continued toward the east.
Beyond thirty, and separated from my ship, my authority ceased. I
held leadership, if I was to hold it at all, by virtue of personal
qualifications only, but I did not doubt my ability to remain the
director of our destinies in so far as they were amenable to human
agencies. I have always led. While my brain and brawn remain
unimpaired I shall continue always to lead. Following is an art
which Turcks do not easily learn.</p>

<p>It was not until the third day that we raised land, dead ahead,
which I took, from my map, to be the isles of Scilly. But such a
gale was blowing that I did not dare attempt to land, and so we
passed to the north of them, skirted Land's End, and entered the
English Channel.</p>

<p>I think that up to that moment I had never experienced such a
thrill as passed through me when I realized that I was navigating
these historic waters. The lifelong dreams that I never had dared
hope to see fulfilled were at last a reality&mdash;but under what
forlorn circumstances!</p>

<p>Never could I return to my native land. To the end of my days I
must remain in exile. Yet even these thoughts failed to dampen my
ardor.</p>

<p>My eyes scanned the waters. To the north I could see the
rockbound coast of Cornwall. Mine were the first American eyes to
rest upon it for more than two hundred years. In vain, I searched
for some sign of ancient commerce that, if history is to be
believed, must have dotted the bosom of the Channel with white
sails and blackened the heavens with the smoke of countless
funnels, but as far as eye could reach the tossing waters of the
Channel were empty and deserted.</p>

<p>Toward midnight the wind and sea abated, so that shortly after
dawn I determined to make inshore in an attempt to effect a
landing, for we were sadly in need of fresh water and food.</p>

<p>According to my observations, we were just off Ram Head, and it
was my intention to enter Plymouth Bay and visit Plymouth. From my
map it appeared that this city lay back from the coast a short
distance, and there was another city given as Devonport, which
appeared to lie at the mouth of the river Tamar.</p>

<p>However, I knew that it would make little difference which city
we entered, as the English people were famed of old for their
hospitality toward visiting mariners. As we approached the mouth of
the bay I looked for the fishing craft which I expected to see
emerging thus early in the day for their labors. But even after we
rounded Ram Head and were well within the waters of the bay I saw
no vessel. Neither was there buoy nor light nor any other mark to
show larger ships the channel, and I wondered much at this.</p>

<p>The coast was densely overgrown, nor was any building or sign of
man apparent from the water. Up the bay and into the River Tamar we
motored through a solitude as unbroken as that which rested upon
the waters of the Channel. For all we could see, there was no
indication that man had ever set his foot upon this silent
coast.</p>

<p>I was nonplused, and then, for the first time, there crept over
me an intuition of the truth.</p>

<p>Here was no sign of war. As far as this portion of the Devon
coast was concerned, that seemed to have been over for many years,
but neither were there any people. Yet I could not find it within
myself to believe that I should find no inhabitants in England.
Reasoning thus, I discovered that it was improbable that a state of
war still existed, and that the people all had been drawn from this
portion of England to some other, where they might better defend
themselves against an invader.</p>

<p>But what of their ancient coast defenses? What was there here in
Plymouth Bay to prevent an enemy landing in force and marching
where they wished? Nothing. I could not believe that any
enlightened military nation, such as the ancient English are
reputed to have been, would have voluntarily so deserted an exposed
coast and an excellent harbor to the mercies of an enemy.</p>

<p>I found myself becoming more and more deeply involved in
quandary. The puzzle which confronted me I could not unravel. We
had landed, and I now stood upon the spot where, according to my
map, a large city should rear its spires and chimneys. There was
nothing but rough, broken ground covered densely with weeds and
brambles, and tall, rank, grass.</p>

<p>Had a city ever stood there, no sign of it remained. The
roughness and unevenness of the ground suggested something of a
great mass of debris hidden by the accumulation of centuries of
undergrowth.</p>

<p>I drew the short cutlass with which both officers and men of the
navy are, as you know, armed out of courtesy to the traditions and
memories of the past, and with its point dug into the loam about
the roots of the vegetation growing at my feet.</p>

<p>The blade entered the soil for a matter of seven inches, when it
struck upon something stonelike. Digging about the obstacle, I
presently loosened it, and when I had withdrawn it from its
sepulcher I found the thing to be an ancient brick of clay, baked
in an oven.</p>

<p>Delcarte we had left in charge of the boat; but Snider and
Taylor were with me, and following my example, each engaged in the
fascinating sport of prospecting for antiques. Each of us uncovered
a great number of these bricks, until we commenced to weary of the
monotony of it, when Snider suddenly gave an exclamation of
excitement, and, as I turned to look, he held up a human skull for
my inspection.</p>

<p>I took it from him and examined it. Directly in the center of
the forehead was a small round hole. The gentleman had evidently
come to his end defending his country from an invader.</p>

<p>Snider again held aloft another trophy of the search&mdash;a
metal spike and some tarnished and corroded metal ornaments. They
had lain close beside the skull.</p>

<p>With the point of his cutlass Snider scraped the dirt and
verdigris from the face of the larger ornament.</p>

<p>"An inscription," he said, and handed the thing to me.</p>

<p>They were the spike and ornaments of an ancient German helmet.
Before long we had uncovered many other indications that a great
battle had been fought upon the ground where we stood. But I was
then, and still am, at loss to account for the presence of German
soldiers upon the English coast so far from London, which history
suggests would have been the natural goal of an invader.</p>

<p>I can only account for it by assuming that either England was
temporarily conquered by the Teutons, or that an invasion of so
vast proportions was undertaken that German troops were hurled upon
the England coast in huge numbers and that landings were
necessarily effected at many places simultaneously. Subsequent
discoveries tend to strengthen this view.</p>

<p>We dug about for a short time with our cutlasses until I became
convinced that a city had stood upon the spot at some time in the
past, and that beneath our feet, crumbled and dead, lay ancient
Devonport.</p>

<p>I could not repress a sigh at the thought of the havoc war had
wrought in this part of England, at least. Farther east, nearer
London, we should find things very different. There would be the
civilization that two centuries must have wrought upon our English
cousins as they had upon us. There would be mighty cities,
cultivated fields, happy people. There we would be welcomed as
long-lost brothers. There would we find a great nation anxious to
learn of the world beyond their side of thirty, as I had been
anxious to learn of that which lay beyond our side of the dead
line.</p>

<p>I turned back toward the boat.</p>

<p>"Come, men!" I said. "We will go up the river and fill our casks
with fresh water, search for food and fuel, and then tomorrow be in
readiness to push on toward the east. I am going to London."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE report of a gun blasted the silence of a dead
Devonport with startling abruptness.</p>

<p>It came from the direction of the launch, and in an instant we
three were running for the boat as fast as our legs would carry us.
As we came in sight of it we saw Delcarte a hundred yards inland
from the launch, leaning over something which lay upon the ground.
As we called to him he waved his cap, and stooping, lifted a small
deer for our inspection.</p>

<p>I was about to congratulate him on his trophy when we were
startled by a horrid, half-human, half-bestial scream a little
ahead and to the right of us. It seemed to come from a clump of
rank and tangled bush not far from where Delcarte stood. It was a
horrid, fearsome sound, the like of which never had fallen upon my
ears before.</p>

<p>We looked in the direction from which it came. The smile had
died from Delcarte's lips. Even at the distance we were from him I
saw his face go suddenly white, and he quickly threw his rifle to
his shoulder. At the same moment the thing that had given tongue to
the cry moved from the concealing brushwood far enough for us, too,
to see it.</p>

<p>Both Taylor and Snider gave little gasps of astonishment and
dismay.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>The creature stood about the height of a tall man's waist, and
was long and gaunt and sinuous, with a tawny coat striped with
black, and with white throat and belly. In conformation it was
similar to a cat&mdash;a huge cat, exaggerated colossal cat, with
fiendish eyes and the most devilish cast of countenance, as it
wrinkled its bristling snout and bared its great yellow fangs.</p>

<p>It was pacing, or rather, slinking, straight for Delcarte, who
had now leveled his rifle upon it.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" mumbled Snider again, and then a
half-forgotten picture from an old natural history sprang to my
mind, and I recognized in the frightful beast the <i>Felis
tigris</i> of ancient Asia, specimens of which had, in former
centuries, been exhibited in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Snider and Taylor were armed with rifles and revolvers, while I
carried only a revolver. Seizing Snider's rifle from his trembling
hands, I called to Taylor to follow me, and together we ran
forward, shouting, to attract the beast's attention from Delcarte
until we should all be quite close enough to attack with the
greatest assurance of success.</p>

<p>I cried to Delcarte not to fire until we reached his side, for I
was fearful lest our small caliber, steel-jacketed bullets should,
far from killing the beast, tend merely to enrage it still further.
But he misunderstood me, thinking that I had ordered him to
fire.</p>

<p>With the report of his rifle the tiger stopped short in apparent
surprise, then turned and bit savagely at its shoulder for an
instant, after which it wheeled again toward Delcarte, issuing the
most terrific roars and screams, and launched itself, with
incredible speed, toward the brave fellow, who now stood his ground
pumping bullets from his automatic rifle as rapidly as the weapon
would fire.</p>

<p>Taylor and I also opened up on the creature, and as it was
broadside to us it offered a splendid target, though for all the
impression we appeared to make upon the great cat we might as well
have been launching soap bubbles at it.</p>

<p>Straight as a torpedo it rushed for Delcarte, and, as Taylor and
I stumbled on through the tall grass toward our unfortunate
comrade, we saw the tiger rear upon him and crush him to the
earth.</p>

<p>Not a backward step had the noble Delcarte taken. Two hundred
years of peace had not sapped the red blood from his courageous
line. He went down beneath that avalanche of bestial savagery still
working his gun and with his face toward his antagonist. Even in
the instant that I thought him dead I could not help but feel a
thrill of pride that he was one of my men, one of my class, a
Pan-American gentleman of birth. And that he had demonstrated one
of the principal contentions of the army-and-navy
adherents&mdash;that military training was necessary for the
salvation of personal courage in the Pan-American race which for
generations had had to face no dangers more grave than those
incident to ordinary life in a highly civilized community,
safeguarded by every means at the disposal of a perfectly organized
and all-powerful government utilizing the best that advanced
science could suggest.</p>

<p>As we ran toward Delcarte, both Taylor and I were struck by the
fact that the beast upon him appeared not to be mauling him, but
lay quiet and motionless upon its prey, and when we were quite
close, and the muzzles of our guns were at the animal's head, I saw
the explanation of this sudden cessation of
hostilities&mdash;<i>Felis tigris</i> was dead.</p>

<p>One of our bullets, or one of the last that Delcarte fired, had
penetrated the heart, and the beast had died even as it sprawled
forward crushing Delcarte to the ground.</p>

<p>A moment later, with our assistance, the man had scrambled from
beneath the carcass of his would-be slayer, without a scratch to
indicate how close to death he had been.</p>

<p>Delcarte's buoyancy was entirely unruffled. He came from under
the tiger with a broad grin on his handsome face, nor could I
perceive that a muscle trembled or that his voice showed the least
indication of nervousness or excitement.</p>

<p>With the termination of the adventure, we began to speculate
upon the explanation of the presence of this savage brute at large
so great a distance from its native habitat. My readings had taught
me that it was practically unknown outside of Asia, and that, so
late as the twentieth century, at least, there had been no savage
beasts outside captivity in England.</p>

<p>As we talked, Snider joined us, and I returned his rifle to him.
Taylor and Delcarte picked up the slain deer, and we all started
down toward the launch, walking slowly. Delcarte wanted to fetch
the tiger's skin, but I had to deny him permission, since we had no
means to properly cure it.</p>

<p>Upon the beach, we skinned the deer and cut away as much meat as
we thought we could dispose of, and as we were again embarking to
continue up the river for fresh water and fuel, we were startled by
a series of screams from the bushes a short distance away.</p>

<p>"Another <i>Felis tigris</i>," said Taylor.</p>

<p>"Or a dozen of them," supplemented Delcarte, and, even as he
spoke, there leaped into sight, one after another, eight of the
beasts, full grown&mdash;magnificent specimens.</p>

<p>At the sight of us, they came charging down like infuriated
demons. I saw that three rifles would be no match for them, and so
I gave the word to put out from shore, hoping that the "tiger," as
the ancients called him, could not swim.</p>

<p>Sure enough, they all halted at the beach, pacing back and
forth, uttering fiendish cries, and glaring at us in the most
malevolent manner.</p>

<p>As we motored away, we presently heard the calls of similar
animals far inland. They seemed to be answering the cries of their
fellows at the water's edge, and from the wide distribution and
great volume of the sound we came to the conclusion that enormous
numbers of these beasts must roam the adjacent country.</p>

<p>"They have eaten up the inhabitants," murmured Snider,
shuddering.</p>

<p>"I imagine you are right," I agreed, "for their extreme boldness
and fearlessness in the presence of man would suggest either that
man is entirely unknown to them, or that they are extremely
familiar with him as their natural and most easily procured
prey."</p>

<p>"But where did they come from?" asked Delcarte. "Could they have
traveled here from Asia?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. The thing was a puzzle to me. I knew that it
was practically beyond reason to imagine that tigers had crossed
the mountain ranges and rivers and all the great continent of
Europe to travel this far from their native lairs, and entirely
impossible that they should have crossed the English Channel at
all. Yet here they were, and in great numbers.</p>

<p>We continued up the Tamar several miles, filled our casks, and
then landed to cook some of our deer steak, and have the first
square meal that had fallen to our lot since the <i>Coldwater</i>
deserted us. But scarce had we built our fire and prepared the meat
for cooking than Snider, whose eyes had been constantly roving
about the landscape from the moment that we left the launch,
touched me on the arm and pointed to a clump of bushes which grew a
couple of hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Half concealed behind their screening foliage I saw the yellow
and black of a big tiger, and, as I looked, the beast stalked
majestically toward us. A moment later, he was followed by another
and another, and it is needless to state that we beat a hasty
retreat to the launch.</p>

<p>The country was apparently infested by these huge Carnivora, for
after three other attempts to land and cook our food we were forced
to abandon the idea entirely, as each time we were driven off by
hunting tigers.</p>

<p>It was also equally impossible to obtain the necessary
ingredients for our chemical fuel, and, as we had very little left
aboard, we determined to step our folding mast and proceed under
sail, hoarding our fuel supply for use in emergencies.</p>

<p>I may say that it was with no regret that we bid adieu to
Tigerland, as we rechristened the ancient Devon, and, beating out
into the Channel, turned the launch's nose southeast, to round Bolt
Head and continue up the coast toward the Strait of Dover and the
North Sea.</p>

<p>I was determined to reach London as soon as possible, that we
might obtain fresh clothing, meet with cultured people, and learn
from the lips of Englishmen the secrets of the two centuries since
the East had been divorced from the West.</p>

<p>Our first stopping place was the Isle of Wight. We entered the
Solent about ten o'clock one morning, and I must confess that my
heart sank as we came close to shore. No lighthouse was visible,
though one was plainly indicated upon my map. Upon neither shore
was sign of human habitation. We skirted the northern shore of the
island in fruitless search for man, and then at last landed upon an
eastern point, where Newport should have stood, but where only
weeds and great trees and tangled wild wood rioted, and not a
single man-made thing was visible to the eye.</p>

<p>Before landing, I had the men substitute soft bullets for the
steel-jacketed projectiles with which their belts and magazines
were filled. Thus equipped, we felt upon more even terms with the
tigers, but there was no sign of the tigers, and I decided that
they must be confined to the mainland.</p>

<p>After eating, we set out in search of fuel, leaving Taylor to
guard the launch. For some reason I could not trust Snider alone. I
knew that he looked with disapproval upon my plan to visit England,
and I did not know but what at his first opportunity, he might
desert us, taking the launch with him, and attempt to return to
Pan-America.</p>

<p>That he would be fool enough to venture it, I did not doubt.</p>

<p>We had gone inland for a mile or more, and were passing through
a park-like wood, when we came suddenly upon the first human beings
we had seen since we sighted the English coast.</p>

<p>There were a score of men in the party. Hairy, half-naked men
they were, resting in the shade of a great tree. At the first sight
of us they sprang to their feet with wild yells, seizing long
spears that had lain beside them as they rested.</p>

<p>For a matter of fifty yards they ran from us as rapidly as they
could, and then they turned and surveyed us for a moment. Evidently
emboldened by the scarcity of our numbers, they commenced to
advance upon us, brandishing their spears and shouting
horribly.</p>

<p>They were short and muscular of build, with long hair and beards
tangled and matted with filth. Their heads, however, were shapely,
and their eyes, though fierce and warlike, were intelligent.</p>

<p>Appreciation of these physical attributes came later, of course,
when I had better opportunity to study the men at close range and
under circumstances less fraught with danger and excitement. At the
moment I saw, and with unmixed wonder, only a score of wild savages
charging down upon us, where I had expected to find a community of
civilized and enlightened people.</p>

<p>Each of us was armed with rifle, revolver, and cutlass, but as
we stood shoulder to shoulder facing the wild men I was loath to
give the command to fire upon them, inflicting death or suffering
upon strangers with whom we had no quarrel, and so I attempted to
restrain them for the moment that we might parley with them.</p>

<p>To this end I raised my left hand above my head with the palm
toward them as the most natural gesture indicative of peaceful
intentions which occurred to me. At the same time I called aloud to
them that we were friends, though, from their appearance, there was
nothing to indicate that they might understand Pan-American, or
ancient English, which are of course practically identical.</p>

<p>At my gesture and words they ceased their shouting and came to a
halt a few paces from us. Then, in deep tones, one who was in
advance of the others and whom I took to be the chief or leader of
the party replied in a tongue which while intelligible to us, was
so distorted from the English language from which it evidently had
sprung, that it was with difficulty that we interpreted it.</p>

<p>"Who are you," he asked, "and from what country?"</p>

<p>I told him that we were from Pan-America, but he only shook his
head and asked where that was. He had never heard of it, or of the
Atlantic Ocean which I told him separated his country from
mine.</p>

<p>"It has been two hundred years," I told him, "since a
Pan-American visited England."</p>

<p>"England?" he asked. "What is England?"</p>

<p>"Why this is a part of England!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"This is Grubitten," he assured me. "I know nothing about
England, and I have lived here all my life."</p>

<p>It was not until long after that the derivation of Grubitten
occurred to me. Unquestionably it is a corruption of Great Britain,
a name formerly given to the large island comprising England,
Scotland and Wales. Subsequently we heard it pronounced Grabrittin
and Grubritten.</p>

<p>I then asked the fellow if he could direct us to Ryde or
Newport; but again he shook his head, and said that he never had
heard of such countries. And when I asked him if there were any
cities in this country he did not know what I meant, never having
heard the word cities.</p>

<p>I explained my meaning as best I could by stating that by city I
referred to a place where many people lived together in houses.</p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed, "you mean a camp! Yes, there are two great
camps here, East Camp and West Camp. We are from East Camp."</p>

<p>The use of the word camp to describe a collection of habitations
naturally suggested war to me, and my next question was as to
whether the war was over, and who had been victorious.</p>

<p>"No," he replied to this question. "The war is not yet over. But
it soon will be, and it will end, as it always does, with the
Westenders running away. We, the Eastenders, are always
victorious."</p>

<p>"No," I said, seeing that he referred to the petty tribal wars
of his little island, "I mean the Great War, the war with Germany.
Is it ended&mdash;and who was victorious?"</p>

<p>He shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>"I never heard," he said, "of any of these strange countries of
which you speak."</p>

<p>It seemed incredible, and yet it was true. These people living
at the very seat of the Great War knew nothing of it, though but
two centuries had passed since, to our knowledge, it had been
running in the height of its titanic frightfulness all about them,
and to us upon the far side of the Atlantic still was a subject of
keen interest.</p>

<p>Here was a lifelong inhabitant of the Isle of Wight who never
had heard of either Germany or England! I turned to him quite
suddenly with a new question.</p>

<p>"What people live upon the mainland?" I asked, and pointed in
the direction of the Hants coast.</p>

<p>"No one lives there," he replied.</p>

<p>"Long ago, it is said, my people dwelt across the waters upon
that other land; but the wild beasts devoured them in such numbers
that finally they were driven here, paddling across upon logs and
driftwood, nor has any dared return since, because of the frightful
creatures which dwell in that horrid country."</p>

<p>"Do no other peoples ever come to your country in ships?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He never heard the word ship before, and did not know its
meaning. But he assured me that until we came he had thought that
there were no other peoples in the world other than the Grubittens,
who consist of the Eastenders and the Westenders of the ancient
Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Assured that we were inclined to friendliness, our new
acquaintances led us to their village, or, as they call it, camp.
There we found a thousand people, perhaps, dwelling in rude
shelters, and living upon the fruits of the chase and such sea food
as is obtainable close to shore, for they had no boats, nor any
knowledge of such things.</p>

<p>Their weapons were most primitive, consisting of rude spears
tipped with pieces of metal pounded roughly into shape. They had no
literature, no religion, and recognized no law other than the law
of might. They produced fire by striking a bit of flint and steel
together, but for the most part they ate their food raw. Marriage
is unknown among them, and while they have the word, mother, they
did not know what I meant by "father." The males fight for the
favor of the females. They practice infanticide, and kill the aged
and physically unfit.</p>

<p>The family consists of the mother and the children, the men
dwelling sometimes in one hut and sometimes in another. Owing to
their bloody duels, they are always numerically inferior to the
women, so there is shelter for them all.</p>

<p>We spent several hours in the village, where we were objects of
the greatest curiosity. The inhabitants examined our clothing and
all our belongings, and asked innumerable questions concerning the
strange country from which we had come and the manner of our
coming.</p>

<p>I questioned many of them concerning past historical events, but
they knew nothing beyond the narrow limits of their island and the
savage, primitive life they led there. London they had never heard
of, and they assured me that I would find no human beings upon the
mainland.</p>

<p>Much saddened by what I had seen, I took my departure from them,
and the three of us made our way back to the launch, accompanied by
about five hundred men, women, girls, and boys.</p>

<p>As we sailed away, after procuring the necessary ingredients of
our chemical fuel, the Grubittens lined the shore in silent wonder
at the strange sight of our dainty craft dancing over the sparkling
waters, and watched us until we were lost to their sight.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was during the morning of July 6, 2137, that we
entered the mouth of the Thames&mdash;to the best of my knowledge
the first Western keel to cut those historic waters for two hundred
and twenty-one years!</p>

<p>But where were the tugs and the lighters and the barges, the
lightships and the buoys, and all those countless attributes which
went to make up the myriad life of the ancient Thames?</p>

<p>Gone! All gone! Only silence and desolation reigned where once
the commerce of the world had centered.</p>

<p>I could not help but compare this once great water-way with the
waters about our New York, or Rio, or San Diego, or Valparaiso.
They had become what they are today during the two centuries of the
profound peace which we of the navy have been prone to deplore. And
what, during this same period, had shorn the waters of the Thames
of their pristine grandeur?</p>

<p>Militarist that I am, I could find but a single word
ofexplanation&mdash;war!</p>

<p>I bowed my head and turned my eyes downward from the lonely and
depressing sight, and in a silence which none of us seemed willing
to break, we proceeded up the deserted river.</p>

<p>We had reached a point which, from my map, I imagined must have
been about the former site of Erith, when I discovered a small band
of antelope a short distance inland. As we were now entirely out of
meat once more, and as I had given up all expectations of finding a
city upon the site of ancient London, I determined to land and bag
a couple of the animals.</p>

<p>Assured that they would be timid and easily frightened, I
decided to stalk them alone, telling the men to wait at the boat
until I called to them to come and carry the carcasses back to the
shore.</p>

<p>Crawling carefully through the vegetation, making use of such
trees and bushes as afforded shelter, I came at last almost within
easy range of my quarry, when the antlered head of the buck went
suddenly into the air, and then, as though in accordance with a
prearranged signal, the whole band moved slowly off, farther
inland.</p>

<p>As their pace was leisurely, I determined to follow them until I
came again within range, as I was sure that they would stop and
feed in a short time.</p>

<p>They must have led me a mile or more at least before they again
halted and commenced to browse upon the rank, luxuriant grasses.
All the time that I had followed them I had kept both eyes and ears
alert for sign or sound that would indicate the presence of
<i>Felis tigris</i>; but so far not the slightest indication of the
beast had been apparent.</p>

<p>As I crept closer to the antelope, sure this time of a good shot
at a large buck, I suddenly saw something that caused me to forget
all about my prey in wonderment.</p>

<p>It was the figure of an immense grey-black creature, rearing its
colossal shoulders twelve or fourteen feet above the ground. Never
in my life had I seen such a beast, nor did I at first recognize
it, so different in appearance is the live reality from the
stuffed, unnatural specimens preserved to us in our museums.</p>

<p>But presently I guessed the identity of the mighty creature as
<i>Elephas africanus</i>, or, as the ancients commonly described
it, African elephant.</p>

<p>The antelope, although in plain view of the huge beast, paid not
the slightest attention to it, and I was so wrapped up in watching
the mighty pachyderm that I quite forgot to shoot at the buck and
presently, and in quite a startling manner, it became impossible to
do so.</p>

<p>The elephant was browsing upon the young and tender shoots of
some low bushes, waving his great ears and switching his short
tail. The antelope, scarce twenty paces from him, continued their
feeding, when suddenly, from close beside the latter, there came a
most terrifying roar, and I saw a great, tawny body shoot, from the
concealing verdure beyond the antelope, full upon the back of a
small buck.</p>

<p>Instantly the scene changed from one of quiet and peace to
indescribable chaos. The startled and terrified buck uttered cries
of agony. His fellows broke and leaped off in all directions. The
elephant raised his trunk, and, trumpeting loudly, lumbered off
through the wood, crushing down small trees and trampling bushes in
his mad flight.</p>

<p>Growling horribly, a huge lion stood across the body of his
prey&mdash;such a creature as no Pan-American of the twenty-second
century had ever beheld until my eyes rested upon this lordly
specimen of "the king of beasts." But what a different creature was
this fierce-eyed demon, palpitating with life and vigor, glossy of
coat, alert, growling, magnificent, from the dingy, moth-eaten
replicas beneath their glass cases in the stuffy halls of our
public museums.</p>

<p>I had never hoped or expected to see a living lion, tiger, or
elephant&mdash;using the common terms that were familiar to the
ancients, since they seem to me less unwieldy than those now in
general use among us&mdash;and so it was with sentiments not
unmixed with awe that I stood gazing at this regal beast as, above
the carcass of his kill, he roared out his challenge to the
world.</p>

<p>So enthralled was I by the spectacle that I quite forgot myself,
and the better to view him, the great lion, I had risen to my feet
and stood, not fifty paces from him, in full view.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not see me, his attention being directed
toward the retreating elephant, and I had ample time to feast my
eyes upon his splendid proportions, his great head, and his thick
black mane.</p>

<p>Ah, what thoughts passed through my mind in those brief moments
as I stood there in rapt fascination! I had come to find a wondrous
civilization, and instead I found a wild beast monarch of the realm
where English kings had ruled. A lion reigned, undisturbed, within
a few miles of the seat of one of the greatest governments the
world has ever known, his domain a howling wilderness, where
yesterday fell the shadows of the largest city in the world.</p>

<p>It was appalling; but my reflections upon this depressing
subject were doomed to sudden extinction. The lion had discovered
me.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood silent and motionless as one of the
mangy effigies at home, but only for an instant. Then, with a most
ferocious roar, and without the slightest hesitancy or warning, he
charged upon me.</p>

<p>He forsook the prey already dead beneath him for the pleasures
of the delectable tidbit, man. From the remorselessness with which
the great Carnivora of modern England hunted man, I am constrained
to believe that, whatever their appetites in times past, they have
cultivated a gruesome taste for human flesh.</p>

<p>As I threw my rifle to my shoulder, I thanked God, the ancient
God of my ancestors, that I had replaced the hard-jacketed bullets
in my weapon with soft-nosed projectiles, for though this was my
first experience with <i>Felis leo</i>, I knew the moment that I
faced that charge that even my wonderfully perfected firearm would
be as futile as a peashooter unless I chanced to place my first
bullet in a vital spot.</p>

<p>Unless you had seen it you could not believe credible the speed
of a charging lion. Apparently the animal is not built for speed,
nor can he maintain it for long. But for a matter of forty or fifty
yards there is, I believe, no animal on earth that can overtake
him.</p>

<p>Like a bolt he bore down upon me, but, fortunately for me, I did
not lose my head. I guessed that no bullet would kill him
instantly. I doubted that I could pierce his skull. There was hope,
though, in finding his heart through his exposed chest, or, better
yet, of breaking his shoulder or foreleg, and bringing him up long
enough to pump more bullets into him and finish him.</p>

<p>I covered his left shoulder and pulled the trigger as he was
almost upon me. It stopped him. With a terrific howl of pain and
rage, the brute rolled over and over upon the ground almost to my
feet. As he came I pumped two more bullets into him, and as he
struggled to rise, clawing viciously at me, I put a bullet in his
spine.</p>

<p>That finished him, and I am free to admit that I was mighty glad
of it. There was a great tree close behind me, and, stepping within
its shade, I leaned against it, wiping the perspiration from my
face, for the day was hot, and the exertion and excitement left me
exhausted.</p>

<p>I stood there, resting, for a moment, preparatory to turning and
retracing my steps to the launch, when, without warning, something
whizzed through space straight toward me. There was a dull thud of
impact as it struck the tree, and as I dodged to one side and
turned to look at the thing I saw a heavy spear embedded in the
wood not three inches from where my head had been.</p>

<p>The thing had come from a little to one side of me, and, without
waiting to investigate at the instant, I leaped behind the tree,
and, circling it, peered around the other side to get a sight of my
would-be murderer.</p>

<p>This time I was pitted against men&mdash;the spear told me that
all too plainly&mdash;but so long as they didn't take me unawares
or from behind I had little fear of them.</p>

<p>Cautiously I edged about the far side of the trees until I could
obtain a view of the spot from which the spear must have come, and
when I did I saw the head of a man just emerging from behind a
bush.</p>

<p>The fellow was quite similar in type to those I had seen upon
the Isle of Wight. He was hairy and unkempt, and as he finally
stepped into view I saw that he was garbed in the same primitive
fashion.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment gazing about in search of me, and then he
advanced. As he did so a number of others, precisely like him,
stepped from the concealing verdure of nearby bushes and followed
in his wake. Keeping the trees between them and me, I ran back a
short distance until I found a clump of underbrush that would
effectually conceal me, for I wished to discover the strength of
the party and its armament before attempting to parley with it.</p>

<p>The useless destruction of any of these poor creatures was the
farthest idea from my mind. I should have liked to have spoken with
them, but I did not care to risk having to use my high-powered
rifle upon them other than in the last extremity.</p>

<p>Once in my new place of concealment, I watched them as they
approached the tree. There were about thirty men in the party and
one woman&mdash;a girl whose hands seemed to be bound behind her
and who was being pulled along by two of the men.</p>

<p>They came forward warily, peering cautiously into every bush and
halting often. At the body of the lion, they paused, and I could
see from their gesticulations and the higher pitch of their voices
that they were much excited over my kill.</p>

<p>But presently they resumed their search for me, and as they
advanced I became suddenly aware of the unnecessary brutality with
which the girl's guards were treating her. She stumbled once, not
far from my place of concealment, and after the balance of the
party had passed me. As she did so one of the men at her side
jerked her roughly to her feet and struck her across the mouth with
his fist.</p>

<p>Instantly my blood boiled, and forgetting every consideration of
caution, I leaped from my concealment, and, springing to the man's
side, felled him with a blow.</p>

<p>So unexpected had been my act that it found him and his fellow
unprepared; but instantly the latter drew the knife that protruded
from his belt and lunged viciously at me, at the same time giving
voice to a wild cry of alarm.</p>

<p>The girl shrank back at sight of me, her eyes wide in
astonishment, and then my antagonist was upon me. I parried his
first blow with my forearm, at the same time delivering a powerful
blow to his jaw that sent him reeling back; but he was at me again
in an instant, though in the brief interim I had time to draw my
revolver.</p>

<p>I saw his companion crawling slowly to his feet, and the others
of the party racing down upon me. There was no time to argue now,
other than with the weapons we wore, and so, as the fellow lunged
at me again with the wicked-looking knife, I covered his heart and
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Without a sound, he slipped to the earth, and then I turned the
weapon upon the other guard, who was now about to attack me. He,
too, collapsed, and I was alone with the astonished girl.</p>

<p>The balance of the party was some twenty paces from us, but
coming rapidly. I seized her arm and drew her after me behind a
nearby tree, for I had seen that with both their comrades down the
others were preparing to launch their spears.</p>

<p>With the girl safe behind the tree, I stepped out in sight of
the advancing foe, shouting to them that I was no enemy, and that
they should halt and listen to me. But for answer they only yelled
in derision and launched a couple of spears at me, both of which
missed.</p>

<p>I saw then that I must fight, yet still I hated to slay them,
and it was only as a final resort that I dropped two of them with
my rifle, bringing the others to a temporary halt. Again, I
appealed to them to desist. But they only mistook my solicitude for
them for fear, and, with shouts of rage and derision, leaped
forward once again to overwhelm me.</p>

<p>It was now quite evident that I must punish them severely,
or&mdash;myself&mdash;die and relinquish the girl once more to her
captors. Neither of these things had I the slightest notion of
doing, and so I again stepped from behind the tree, and, with all
the care and deliberation of target practice, I commenced picking
off the foremost of my assailants.</p>

<p>One by one the wild men dropped, yet on came the others, fierce
and vengeful, until, only a few remaining, these seemed to realize
the futility of combating my modern weapon with their primitive
spears, and, still howling wrathfully, withdrew toward the
west.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, I had an opportunity to turn my
attention toward the girl, who had stood, silent and motionless,
behind me as I pumped death into my enemies and hers from my
automatic rifle.</p>

<p>She was of medium height, well formed, and with fine, clear-cut
features. Her forehead was high, and her eyes both intelligent and
beautiful. Exposure to the sun had browned a smooth and velvety
skin to a shade which seemed to enhance rather than mar an
altogether lovely picture of youthful femininity.</p>

<p>A trace of apprehension marked her expression&mdash;I cannot
call it fear since I have learned to know her&mdash;and
astonishment was still apparent in her eyes. She stood quite erect,
her hands still bound behind her, and met my gaze with level, proud
return.</p>

<p>"What language do you speak?" I asked. "Do you understand
mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "It is similar to my own. I am
Grabritin&mdash;What are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a Pan-American," I answered. She shook her head. "What is
that?"</p>

<p>I pointed toward the west. "Far away, across the ocean."</p>

<p>Her expression altered a trifle. A slight frown contracted her
brow. The expression of apprehension deepened.</p>

<p>"Take off your cap," she said, and when, to humor her strange
request, I did as she bid, she appeared relieved. Then she edged to
one side and leaned over seemingly to peer behind me. I turned
quickly to see what she discovered, but finding nothing, wheeled
about to see that her expression was once more altered.</p>

<p>"You are not from there?" and she pointed toward the east. It
was a half question. "You are not from across the water there?"</p>

<p>"No," I assured her. "I am from Pan-America, far away to the
west. Have you ever heard of Pan-America?"</p>

<p>She shook her head in negation. "I do not care where you are
from," she explained, "if you are not from there, and I am sure you
are not, for the men from there have horns and tails."</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that I restrained a smile.</p>

<p>"Who are the men from there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They are bad men," she replied. "Some of my people do not
believe that there are such creatures. But we have a legend&mdash;a
very old, old legend, that once the men from there came across to
Grabritin. They came upon the water, and under the water, and even
in the air. They came in great numbers, so that they rolled across
the land like a great gray fog. They brought with them thunder and
lightning and smoke that killed, and they fell upon us and slew our
people by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands. But at last
we drove them back to the water's edge, back into the sea, where
many were drowned. Some escaped, and these our people
followed&mdash;men, women, and even children, we followed them
back. That is all. The legend says our people never returned. Maybe
they were all killed. Maybe they are still there. But this, also,
is in the legend, that as we drove the men back across the water
they swore that they would return, and that when they left our
shores they would leave no human being alive behind them. I was
afraid that you were from there."</p>

<p>"By what name were these men called?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We call them only the 'men from there,'" she replied, pointing
toward the east. "I have never heard that they had another
name."</p>

<p>In the light of what I knew of ancient history, it was not
difficult for me to guess the nationality of those she described
simply as "the men from over there." But what utter and appalling
devastation the Great War must have wrought to have erased not only
every sign of civilization from the face of this great land, but
even the name of the enemy from the knowledge and language of the
people.</p>

<p>I could only account for it on the hypothesis that the country
had been entirely depopulated except for a few scattered and
forgotten children, who, in some marvelous manner, had been
preserved by Providence to re-populate the land. These children
had, doubtless, been too young to retain in their memories to
transmit to their children any but the vaguest suggestion of the
cataclysm which had overwhelmed their parents.</p>

<p>Professor Cortoran, since my return to Pan-America, has
suggested another theory which is not entirely without claim to
serious consideration. He points out that it is quite beyond the
pale of human instinct to desert little children as my theory
suggests the ancient English must have done. He is more inclined to
believe that the expulsion of the foe from England was synchronous
with widespread victories by the allies upon the continent, and
that the people of England merely emigrated from their ruined
cities and their devastated, blood-drenched fields to the mainland,
in the hope of finding, in the domain of the conquered enemy,
cities and farms which would replace those they had lost.</p>

<p>The learned professor assumes that while a long-continued war
had strengthened rather than weakened the instinct of paternal
devotion, it had also dulled other humanitarian instincts, and
raised to the first magnitude the law of the survival of the
fittest, with the result that when the exodus took place the
strong, the intelligent, and the cunning, together with their
offspring, crossed the waters of the Channel or the North Sea to
the continent, leaving in unhappy England only the helpless inmates
of asylums for the feebleminded and insane.</p>

<p>My objections to this, that the present inhabitants of England
are mentally fit, and could therefore not have descended from an
ancestry of undiluted lunacy he brushes aside with the assertion
that insanity is not necessarily hereditary; and that even though
it was, in many cases a return to natural conditions from the state
of high civilization, which is thought to have induced mental
disease in the ancient world, would, after several generations,
have thoroughly expunged every trace of the affliction from the
brains and nerves of the descendants of the original maniacs.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not place much stock in Professor Cortoran's
theory, though I admit that I am prejudiced. Naturally one does not
care to believe that the object of his greatest affection is
descended from a gibbering idiot and a raving maniac.</p>

<p>But I am forgetting the continuity of my narrative&mdash;a
continuity which I desire to maintain, though I fear that I shall
often be led astray, so numerous and varied are the bypaths of
speculation which lead from the present day story of the Grabritins
into the mysterious past of their forbears.</p>

<p>As I stood talking with the girl I presently recollected that
she still was bound, and with a word of apology, I drew my knife
and cut the rawhide thongs which confined her wrists at her
back.</p>

<p>She thanked me, and with such a sweet smile that I should have
been amply repaid by it for a much more arduous service.</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "let me accompany you to your home and see
you safely again under the protection of your friends."</p>

<p>"No," she said, with a hint of alarm in her voice; "you must not
come with me&mdash;Buckingham will kill you."</p>

<p>Buckingham. The name was famous in ancient English history. Its
survival, with many other illustrious names, is one of the
strongest arguments in refutation of Professor Cortoran's theory;
yet it opens no new doors to the past, and, on the whole, rather
adds to than dissipates the mystery.</p>

<p>"And who is Buckingham," I asked, "and why should he wish to
kill me?"</p>

<p>"He would think that you had stolen me," she replied, "and as he
wishes me for himself, he will kill any other whom he thinks
desires me. He killed Wettin a few days ago. My mother told me once
that Wettin was my father. He was king. Now Buckingham is
king."</p>

<p>Here, evidently, were a people slightly superior to those of the
Isle of Wight. These must have at least the rudiments of civilized
government since they recognized one among them as ruler, with the
title, king. Also, they retained the word father. The girl's
pronunciation, while far from identical with ours, was much closer
than the tortured dialect of the Eastenders of the Isle of Wight.
The longer I talked with her the more hopeful I became of finding
here, among her people, some records, or traditions, which might
assist in clearing up the historic enigma of the past two
centuries. I asked her if we were far from the city of London, but
she did not know what I meant. When I tried to explain, describing
mighty buildings of stone and brick, broad avenues, parks, palaces,
and countless people, she but shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"There is no such place near by," she said. "Only the Camp of
the Lions has places of stone where the beasts lair, but there are
no people in the Camp of the Lions. Who would dare go there!" And
she shuddered.</p>

<p>"The Camp of the Lions," I repeated. "And where is that, and
what?"</p>

<p>"It is there," she said, pointing up the river toward the west.
"I have seen it from a great distance, but I have never been there.
We are much afraid of the lions, for this is their country, and
they are angry that man has come to live here.</p>

<p>"Far away there," and she pointed toward the south-west, "is the
land of tigers, which is even worse than this, the land of the
lions, for the tigers are more numerous than the lions and hungrier
for human flesh. There were tigers here long ago, but both the
lions and the men set upon them and drove them off."</p>

<p>"Where did these savage beasts come from?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh," she replied, "they have been here always. It is their
country."</p>

<p>"Do they not kill and eat your people?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Often, when we meet them by accident, and we are too few to
slay them, or when one goes too close to their camp. But seldom do
they hunt us, for they find what food they need among the deer and
wild cattle, and, too, we make them gifts, for are we not intruders
in their country? Really we live upon good terms with them, though
I should not care to meet one were there not many spears in my
party."</p>

<p>"I should like to visit this Camp of the Lions," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you must not!" cried the girl. "That would be terrible.
They would eat you." For a moment, then, she seemed lost in
thought, but presently she turned upon me with: "You must go now,
for any minute Buckingham may come in search of me. Long since
should they have learned that I am gone from the camp&mdash;they
watch over me very closely&mdash;and they will set out after me.
Go! I shall wait here until they come in search of me."</p>

<p>"No," I told her. "I'll not leave you alone in a land infested
by lions and other wild beasts. If you won't let me go as far as
your camp with you, then I'll wait here until they come in search
of you."</p>

<p>"Please go!" she begged. "You have saved me, and I would save
you, but nothing will save you if Buckingham gets his hands on you.
He is a bad man. He wishes to have me for his woman so that he may
be king. He would kill anyone who befriended me, for fear that I
might become another's."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say that Buckingham is already the king?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"He is. He took my mother for his woman after he had killed
Wettin. But my mother will die soon&mdash;she is very old&mdash;and
then the man to whom I belong will become king."</p>

<p>Finally, after much questioning, I got the thing through my
head. It appears that the line of descent is through the women. A
man is merely head of his wife's family&mdash;that is all. If she
chances to be the oldest female member of the "royal" house, he is
king. Very naively the girl explained that there was seldom any
doubt as to whom a child's mother was.</p>

<p>This accounted for the girl's importance in the community and
for Buckingham's anxiety to claim her, though she told me that she
did not wish to become his woman, for he was a bad man and would
make a bad king. But he was powerful, and there was no other man
who dared dispute his wishes.</p>

<p>"Why not come with me," I suggested, "if you do not wish to
become Buckingham's?"</p>

<p>"Where would you take me?" she asked.</p>

<p>Where, indeed! I had not thought of that. But before I could
reply to her question she shook her head and said, "No, I cannot
leave my people. I must stay and do my best, even if Buckingham
gets me, but you must go at once. Do not wait until it is too late.
The lions have had no offering for a long time, and Buckingham
would seize upon the first stranger as a gift to them."</p>

<p>I did not perfectly understand what she meant, and was about to
ask her when a heavy body leaped upon me from behind, and great
arms encircled my neck. I struggled to free myself and turn upon my
antagonist, but in another instant I was overwhelmed by a half
dozen powerful, half-naked men, while a score of others surrounded
me, a couple of whom seized the girl.</p>

<p>I fought as best I could for my liberty and for hers, but the
weight of numbers was too great, though I had the satisfaction at
least of giving them a good fight.</p>

<p>When they had overpowered me, and I stood, my hands bound behind
me, at the girl's side, she gazed commiseratingly at me.</p>

<p>"It is too bad that you did not do as I bid you," she said, "for
now it has happened just as I feared&mdash;Buckingham has you."</p>

<p>"Which is Buckingham?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am Buckingham," growled a burly, unwashed brute, swaggering
truculently before me. "And who are you who would have stolen my
woman?"</p>

<p>The girl spoke up then and tried to explain that I had not
stolen her; but on the contrary I had saved her from the men from
the "Elephant Country" who were carrying her away.</p>

<p>Buckingham only sneered at her explanation, and a moment later
gave the command that started us all off toward the west. We
marched for a matter of an hour or so, coming at last to a
collection of rude huts, fashioned from branches of trees covered
with skins and grasses and sometimes plastered with mud. All about
the camp they had erected a wall of saplings pointed at the tops
and fire hardened.</p>

<p>This palisade was a protection against both man and beasts, and
within it dwelt upward of two thousand persons, the shelters being
built very close together, and sometimes partially underground,
like deep trenches, with the poles and hides above merely as
protection from the sun and rain.</p>

<p>The older part of the camp consisted almost wholly of trenches,
as though this had been the original form of dwellings which was
slowly giving way to the drier and airier surface domiciles. In
these trench habitations I saw a survival of the military trenches
which formed so famous a part of the operation of the warring
nations during the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The women wore a single light deerskin about their hips, for it
was summer, and quite warm. The men, too, were clothed in a single
garment, usually the pelt of some beast of prey. The hair of both
men and women was confined by a rawhide thong passing about the
forehead and tied behind. In this leathern band were stuck
feathers, flowers, or the tails of small mammals. All wore
necklaces of the teeth or claws of wild beasts, and there were
numerous metal wristlets and anklets among them.</p>

<p>They wore, in fact, every indication of a most primitive
people&mdash;a race which had not yet risen to the heights of
agriculture or even the possession of domestic animals. They were
hunters&mdash;the lowest plane in the evolution of the human race
of which science takes cognizance.</p>

<p>And yet as I looked at their well shaped heads, their handsome
features, and their intelligent eyes, it was difficult to believe
that I was not among my own. It was only when I took into
consideration their mode of living, their scant apparel, the lack
of every least luxury among them, that I was forced to admit that
they were, in truth, but ignorant savages.</p>

<p>Buckingham had relieved me of my weapons, though he had not the
slightest idea of their purpose or uses, and when we reached the
camp he exhibited both me and my arms with every indication of
pride in this great capture.</p>

<p>The inhabitants flocked around me, examining my clothing, and
exclaiming in wonderment at each new discovery of button, buckle,
pocket, and flap. It seemed incredible that such a thing could be,
almost within a stone's throw of the spot where but a brief two
centuries before had stood the greatest city of the world.</p>

<p>They bound me to a small tree that grew in the middle of one of
their crooked streets, but the girl they released as soon as we had
entered the enclosure. The people greeted her with every mark of
respect as she hastened to a large hut near the center of the
camp.</p>

<p>Presently she returned with a fine looking, white-haired woman,
who proved to be her mother. The older woman carried herself with a
regal dignity that seemed quite remarkable in a place of such
primitive squalor.</p>

<p>The people fell aside as she approached, making a wide way for
her and her daughter. When they had come near and stopped before me
the older woman addressed me.</p>

<p>"My daughter has told me," she said, "of the manner in which you
rescued her from the men of the elephant country. If Wettin lived
you would be well treated, but Buckingham has taken me now, and is
king. You can hope for nothing from such a beast as
Buckingham."</p>

<p>The fact that Buckingham stood within a pace of us and was an
interested listener appeared not to temper her expressions in the
slightest.</p>

<p>"Buckingham is a pig," she continued. "He is a coward. He came
upon Wettin from behind and ran his spear through him. He will not
be king for long. Some one will make a face at him, and he will run
away and jump into the river."</p>

<p>The people began to titter and clap their hands. Buckingham
became red in the face. It was evident that he was far from
popular.</p>

<p>"If he dared," went on the old lady, "he would kill me now, but
he does not dare. He is too great a coward. If I could help you I
should gladly do so. But I am only queen&mdash;the vehicle that has
helped carry down, unsullied, the royal blood from the days when
Grabritin was a mighty country."</p>

<p>The old queen's words had a noticeable effect upon the mob of
curious savages which surrounded me. The moment they discovered
that the old queen was friendly to me and that I had rescued her
daughter they commenced to accord me a more friendly interest, and
I heard many words spoken in my behalf, and demands were made that
I not be harmed.</p>

<p>But now Buckingham interfered. He had no intention of being
robbed of his prey. Blustering and storming, he ordered the people
back to their huts, at the same time directing two of his warriors
to confine me in a dugout in one of the trenches close to his own
shelter.</p>

<p>Here they threw me upon the ground, binding my ankles together
and trussing them up to my wrists behind. There they left me, lying
upon my stomach&mdash;a most uncomfortable and strained position,
to which was added the pain where the cords cut into my flesh.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago my mind had been filled with the
anticipation of the friendly welcome I should find among the
cultured Englishmen of London. Today I should be sitting in the
place of honor at the banquet board of one of London's most
exclusive clubs, feted and lionized.</p>

<p>The actuality! Here I lay, bound hand and foot, doubtless almost
upon the very site of a part of ancient London, yet all about me
was a primeval wilderness, and I was a captive of half-naked wild
men.</p>

<p>I wondered what had become of Delcarte and Taylor and Snider.
Would they search for me? They could never find me, I feared, yet
if they did, what could they accomplish against this horde of
savage warriors?</p>

<p>Would that I could warn them. I thought of the
girl&mdash;doubtless she could get word to them, but how was I to
communicate with her? Would she come to see me before I was killed?
It seemed incredible that she should not make some slight attempt
to befriend me; yet, as I recalled, she had made no effort to speak
with me after we had reached the village. She had hastened to her
mother the moment she had been liberated. Though she had returned
with the old queen, she had not spoken to me, even then. I began to
have my doubts.</p>

<p>Finally, I came to the conclusion that I was absolutely
friendless except for the old queen. For some unaccountable reason
my rage against the girl for her ingratitude rose to colossal
proportions.</p>

<p>For a long time I waited for some one to come to my prison whom
I might ask to bear word to the queen, but I seemed to have been
forgotten. The strained position in which I lay became unbearable.
I wriggled and twisted until I managed to turn myself partially
upon my side, where I lay half facing the entrance to the
dugout.</p>

<p>Presently my attention was attracted by the shadow of something
moving in the trench without, and a moment later the figure of a
child appeared, creeping upon all fours, as, wide-eyed, and
prompted by childish curiosity, a little girl crawled to the
entrance of my hut and peered cautiously and fearfully in.</p>

<p>I did not speak at first for fear of frightening the little one
away. But when I was satisfied that her eyes had become
sufficiently accustomed to the subdued light of the interior, I
smiled.</p>

<p>Instantly the expression of fear faded from her eyes to be
replaced with an answering smile.</p>

<p>"Who are you, little girl?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My name is Mary," she replied. "I am Victory's sister."</p>

<p>"And who is Victory?"</p>

<p>"You do not know who Victory is?" she asked, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>I shook my head in negation.</p>

<p>"You saved her from the elephant country people, and yet you say
you do not know her!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, so she is Victory, and you are her sister! I have not heard
her name before. That is why I did not know whom you meant," I
explained. Here was just the messenger for me. Fate was becoming
more kind.</p>

<p>"Will you do something for me, Mary?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If I can."</p>

<p>"Go to your mother, the queen, and ask her to come to me," I
said. "I have a favor to ask."</p>

<p>She said that she would, and with a parting smile she left
me.</p>

<p>For what seemed many hours I awaited her return, chafing with
impatience. The afternoon wore on and night came, and yet no one
came near me. My captors brought me neither food nor water. I was
suffering considerable pain where the rawhide thongs cut into my
swollen flesh. I thought that they had either forgotten me, or that
it was their intention to leave me here to die of starvation.</p>

<p>Once I heard a great uproar in the village. Men were
shouting&mdash;women were screaming and moaning. After a time this
subsided, and again there was a long interval of silence.</p>

<p>Half the night must have been spent when I heard a sound in the
trench near the hut. It resembled muffled sobs. Presently a figure
appeared, silhouetted against the lesser darkness beyond the
doorway. It crept inside the hut.</p>

<p>"Are you here?" whispered a childlike voice.</p>

<p>It was Mary! She had returned. The thongs no longer hurt me. The
pangs of hunger and thirst disappeared. I realized that it had been
loneliness from which I suffered most.</p>

<p>"Mary!" I exclaimed. "You are a good girl. You have come back,
after all. I had commenced to think that you would not. Did you
give my message to the queen? Will she come? Where is she?"</p>

<p>The child's sobs increased, and she flung herself upon the dirt
floor of the hut, apparently overcome by grief.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked. "Why do you cry?"</p>

<p>"The queen, my mother, will not come to you," she said, between
sobs. "She is dead. Buckingham has killed her. Now he will take
Victory, for Victory is queen. He kept us fastened up in our
shelter, for fear that Victory would escape him, but I dug a hole
beneath the back wall and got out. I came to you, because you saved
Victory once before, and I thought that you might save her again,
and me, also. Tell me that you will."</p>

<p>"I am bound and helpless, Mary," I replied. "Otherwise I would
do what I could to save you and your sister."</p>

<p>"I will set you free!" cried the girl, creeping up to my side.
"I will set you free, and then you may come and slay
Buckingham."</p>

<p>"Gladly!" I assented.</p>

<p>"We must hurry," she went on, as she fumbled with the hard knots
in the stiffened rawhide, "for Buckingham will be after you soon.
He must make an offering to the lions at dawn before he can take
Victory. The taking of a queen requires a human offering!"</p>

<p>"And I am to be the offering?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, tugging at a knot. "Buckingham has been wanting
a sacrifice ever since he killed Wettin, that he might slay my
mother and take Victory."</p>

<p>The thought was horrible, not solely because of the hideous fate
to which I was condemned, but from the contemplation it engendered
of the sad decadence of a once enlightened race. To these depths of
ignorance, brutality, and superstition had the vaunted civilization
of twentieth century England been plunged, and by what? War! I felt
the structure of our time-honored militaristic arguments crumbling
about me.</p>

<p>Mary labored with the thongs that confined me. They proved
refractory&mdash;defying her tender, childish fingers. She assured
me, however, that she would release me, if "they" did not come too
soon.</p>

<p>But, alas, they came. We heard them coming down the trench, and
I bade Mary hide in a corner, lest she be discovered and punished.
There was naught else she could do, and so she crawled away into
the Stygian blackness behind me.</p>

<p>Presently two warriors entered. The leader exhibited a unique
method of discovering my whereabouts in the darkness. He advanced
slowly, kicking out viciously before him. Finally he kicked me in
the face. Then he knew where I was.</p>

<p>A moment later I had been jerked roughly to my feet. One of the
fellows stopped and severed the bonds that held my ankles. I could
scarcely stand alone. The two pulled and hauled me through the low
doorway and along the trench. A party of forty or fifty warriors
were awaiting us at the brink of the excavation some hundred yards
from the hut.</p>

<p>Hands were lowered to us, and we were dragged to the surface.
Then commenced a long march. We stumbled through the underbrush wet
with dew, our way lighted by a score of torchbearers who surrounded
us. But the torches were not to light the way&mdash;that was but
incidental. They were carried to keep off the huge Carnivora that
moaned and coughed and roared about us.</p>

<p>The noises were hideous. The whole country seemed alive with
lions. Yellow-green eyes blazed wickedly at us from out the
surrounding darkness. My escort carried long, heavy spears. These
they kept ever pointed toward the beast of prey, and I learned from
snatches of the conversation I overheard that occasionally there
might be a lion who would brave even the terrors of fire to leap in
upon human prey. It was for such that the spears were always
couched.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort occurred during this hideous death
march, and with the first pale heralding of dawn we reached our
goal&mdash;an open place in the midst of a tangled wildwood. Here
rose in crumbling grandeur the first evidences I had seen of the
ancient civilization which once had graced fair Albion&mdash;a
single, time-worn arch of masonry.</p>

<p>"The entrance to the Camp of the Lions!" murmured one of the
party in a voice husky with awe.</p>

<p>Here the party knelt, while Buckingham recited a weird,
prayer-like chant. It was rather long, and I recall only a portion
of it, which ran, if my memory serves me, somewhat as follows:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse"><i>Lord of Grabritin, we<br>
Fall on our knees to thee,<br>
This gift to bring.<br>
Greatest of kings are thou!<br>
To thee we humbly bow!<br>
Peace to our camp allow.<br>
God save thee, king!</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Then the party rose, and dragging me to the crumbling arch, made
me fast to a huge, corroded, copper ring which was dangling from an
eyebolt embedded in the masonry.</p>

<p>None of them, not even Buckingham, seemed to feel any personal
animosity toward me. They were naturally rough and brutal, as
primitive men are supposed to have been since the dawn of humanity,
but they did not go out of their way to maltreat me.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn the number of lions about us seemed to
have greatly diminished&mdash;at least they made less
noise&mdash;and as Buckingham and his party disappeared into the
woods, leaving me alone to my terrible fate, I could hear the
grumblings and growlings of the beasts diminishing with the sound
of the chant, which the party still continued. It appeared that the
lions had failed to note that I had been left for their breakfast,
and had followed off after their worshippers instead.</p>

<p>But I knew the reprieve would be but for a short time, and
though I had no wish to die, I must confess that I rather wished
the ordeal over and the peace of oblivion upon me.</p>

<p>The voices of the men and the lions receded in the distance,
until finally quiet reigned about me, broken only by the sweet
voices of birds and the sighing of the summer wind in the
trees.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to believe that in this peaceful woodland
setting the frightful thing was to occur which must come with the
passing of the next lion who chanced within sight or smell of the
crumbling arch.</p>

<p>I strove to tear myself loose from my bonds, but succeeded only
in tightening them about my arms. Then I remained passive for a
long time, letting the scenes of my lifetime pass in review before
my mind's eye.</p>

<p>I tried to imagine the astonishment, incredulity, and horror
with which my family and friends would be overwhelmed if, for an
instant, space could be annihilated and they could see me at the
gates of London.</p>

<p>The gates of London! Where was the multitude hurrying to the
marts of trade after a night of pleasure or rest? Where was the
clang of tramcar gongs, the screech of motor horns, the vast murmur
of a dense throng?</p>

<p>Where were they? And as I asked the question a lone, gaunt lion
strode from the tangled jungle upon the far side of the clearing.
Majestically and noiselessly upon his padded feet the king of
beasts moved slowly toward the gates of London and toward me.</p>

<p>Was I afraid? I fear that I was almost afraid. I know that I
thought that fear was coming to me, and so I straightened up and
squared my shoulders and looked the lion straight in the
eyes&mdash;and waited.</p>

<p>It is not a nice way to die&mdash;alone, with one's hands fast
bound, beneath the fangs and talons of a beast of prey. No, it is
not a nice way to die, not a pretty way.</p>

<p>The lion was halfway across the clearing when I heard a slight
sound behind me. The great cat stopped in his tracks. He lashed his
tail against his sides now, instead of simply twitching its tip,
and his low moan became a thunderous roar.</p>

<p>As I craned my neck to catch a glimpse of the thing that had
aroused the fury of the beast before me, it sprang through the
arched gateway and was at my side&mdash;with parted lips and
heaving bosom and disheveled hair &mdash;a bronzed and lovely
vision to eyes that had never harbored hope of rescue.</p>

<p>It was Victory, and in her arms she clutched my rifle and
revolver. A long knife was in the doeskin belt that supported the
doeskin skirt tightly about her lithe limbs. She dropped my weapons
at my feet, and, snatching the knife from its resting place,
severed the bonds that held me. I was free, and the lion was
preparing to charge.</p>

<p>"Run!" I cried to the girl, as I bent and seized my rifle. But
she only stood there at my side, her bared blade ready in her
hand.</p>

<p>The lion was bounding toward us now in prodigious leaps. I
raised the rifle and fired. It was a lucky shot, for I had no time
to aim carefully, and when the beast crumpled and rolled, lifeless,
to the ground, I went upon my knees and gave thanks to the God of
my ancestors.</p>

<p>And, still upon my knees, I turned, and taking the girl's hand
in mine, I kissed it. She smiled at that, and laid her other hand
upon my head.</p>

<p>"You have strange customs in your country," she said.</p>

<p>I could not but smile at that when I thought how strange it
would seem to my countrymen could they but see me kneeling there on
the site of London, kissing the hand of England's queen.</p>

<p>"And now," I said, as I rose, "you must return to the safety of
your camp. I will go with you until you are near enough to continue
alone in safety. Then I shall try to return to my comrades."</p>

<p>"I will not return to the camp," she replied.</p>

<p>"But what shall you do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know. Only I shall never go back while Buckingham
lives. I should rather die than go back to him. Mary came to me,
after they had taken you from the camp, and told me. I found your
strange weapons and followed with them. It took me a little longer,
for often I had to hide in the trees that the lions might not get
me, but I came in time, and now you are free to go back to your
friends."</p>

<p>"And leave you here?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She nodded, but I could see through all her brave front that she
was frightened at the thought. I could not leave her, of course,
but what in the world I was to do, cumbered with the care of a
young woman, and a queen at that, I was at a loss to know. I
pointed out that phase of it to her, but she only shrugged her
shapely shoulders and pointed to her knife.</p>

<p>It was evident that she felt entirely competent to protect
herself.</p>

<p>As we stood there we heard the sound of voices. They were coming
from the forest through which we had passed when we had come from
camp.</p>

<p>"They are searching for me," said the girl. "Where shall we
hide?"</p>

<p>I didn't relish hiding. But when I thought of the innumerable
dangers which surrounded us and the comparatively small amount of
ammunition that I had with me, I hesitated to provoke a battle with
Buckingham and his warriors when, by flight, I could avoid them and
preserve my cartridges against emergencies which could not be
escaped.</p>

<p>"Would they follow us there?" I asked, pointing through the
archway into the Camp of the Lions.</p>

<p>"Never," she replied, "for, in the first place, they would know
that we would not dare go there and, in the second, they themselves
would not dare."</p>

<p>"Then we shall take refuge in the Camp of the Lions," I
said.</p>

<p>She shuddered and drew closer to me.</p>

<p>"You dare?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I returned. "We shall be safe from Buckingham, and
you have seen, for the second time in two days, that lions are
harmless before my weapons. Then, too, I can find my friends
easiest in this direction, for the River Thames runs through this
place you call the Camp of the Lions, and it is farther down the
Thames that my friends are awaiting me. Do you not dare come with
me?"</p>

<p>"I dare follow wherever you lead," she answered simply.</p>

<p>And so I turned and passed beneath the great arch into the city
of London.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS we entered deeper into what had once been the
city, the evidences of man's past occupancy became more frequent.
For a mile from the arch there was only a riot of weeds and
undergrowth and trees covering small mounds and little hillocks
that, I was sure, were formed of the ruins of stately buildings of
the dead past.</p>

<p>But presently we came upon a district where shattered walls
still raised their crumbling tops in sad silence above the
grass-grown sepulchers of their fallen fellows. Softened and
mellowed by ancient ivy stood these sentinels of sorrow, their
scarred faces still revealing the rents and gashes of shrapnel and
of bomb.</p>

<p>Contrary to our expectations, we found little indication that
lions in any great numbers laired in this part of ancient London.
Well-worn pathways, molded by padded paws, led through the
cavernous windows or doorways of a few of the ruins we passed, and
once we saw the savage face of a great, black-maned lion scowling
down upon us from a shattered stone balcony.</p>

<p>We followed down the bank of the Thames after we came upon it. I
was anxious to look with my own eyes upon the famous bridge, and I
guessed, too, that the river would lead me into the part of London
where stood Westminster Abbey and the Tower.</p>

<p>Realizing that the section through which we had been passing was
doubtless outlying, and therefore not so built up with large
structures as the more centrally located part of the old town, I
felt sure that farther down the river I should find the ruins
larger. The bridge would be there in part, at least, and so would
remain the walls of many of the great edifices of the past. There
would be no such complete ruin of large structures as I had seen
among the smaller buildings.</p>

<p>But when I had come to that part of the city which I judged to
have contained the relics I sought I found havoc that had been
wrought there even greater than elsewhere.</p>

<p>At one point upon the bosom of the Thames there rises a few feet
above the water a single, disintegrating mound of masonry. Opposite
it, upon either bank of the river, are tumbled piles of ruins
overgrown with vegetation.</p>

<p>These, I am forced to believe, are all that remain of London
Bridge, for nowhere else along the river is there any other
slightest sign of pier or abutment.</p>

<p>Rounding the base of a large pile of grass-covered debris, we
came suddenly upon the best preserved ruin we had yet discovered.
The entire lower story and part of the second story of what must
once have been a splendid public building rose from a great knoll
of shrubbery and trees, while ivy, thick and luxuriant, clambered
upward to the summit of the broken walls.</p>

<p>In many places the gray stone was still exposed, its smoothly
chiseled face pitted with the scars of battle. The massive portal
yawned, somber and sorrowful, before us, giving a glimpse of marble
halls within.</p>

<p>The temptation to enter was too great. I wished to explore the
interior of this one remaining monument of civilization now dead
beyond recall. Through this same portal, within these very marble
halls, had Gray and Chamberlin and Kitchener and Shaw, perhaps,
come and gone with the other great ones of the past.</p>

<p>I took Victory's hand in mine.</p>

<p>"Come!" I said. "I do not know the name by which this great pile
was known, nor the purposes it fulfilled. It may have been the
palace of your sires, Victory. From some great throne within, your
forebears may have directed the destinies of half the world.
Come!"</p>

<p>I must confess to a feeling of awe as we entered the rotunda of
the great building. Pieces of massive furniture of another day
still stood where man had placed them centuries ago. They were
littered with dust and broken stone and plaster, but, otherwise, so
perfect was their preservation I could hardly believe that two
centuries had rolled by since human eyes were last set upon
them.</p>

<p>Through one great room after another we wandered, hand in hand,
while Victory asked many questions and for the first time I began
to realize something of the magnificence and power of the race from
whose loins she had sprung.</p>

<p>Splendid tapestries, now mildewed and rotting, hung upon the
walls. There were mural paintings, too, depicting great historic
events of the past. For the first time Victory saw the likeness of
a horse, and she was much affected by a huge oil which depicted
some ancient cavalry charge against a battery of field guns.</p>

<p>In other pictures there were steamships, battleships,
submarines, and quaint looking railway trains&mdash;all small and
antiquated in appearance to me, but wonderful to Victory. She told
me that she would like to remain for the rest of her life where she
could look at those pictures daily.</p>

<p>From room to room we passed until presently we emerged into a
mighty chamber, dark and gloomy, for its high and narrow windows
were choked and clogged by ivy. Along one paneled wall we groped,
our eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the darkness. A rank and
pungent odor pervaded the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We had made our way about half the distance across one end of
the great apartment when a low growl from the far end brought us to
a startled halt.</p>

<p>Straining my eyes through the gloom, I made out a raised dais at
the extreme opposite end of the hall. Upon the dais stood two great
chairs, highbacked and with great arms.</p>

<p>The throne of England! But what were those strange forms about
it?</p>

<p>Victory gave my hand a quick, excited little squeeze.</p>

<p>"The lions!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Yes, lions indeed! Sprawled about the dais were a dozen huge
forms, while upon the seat of one of the thrones a small cub lay
curled in slumber.</p>

<p>As we stood there for a moment, spellbound by the sight of those
fearsome creatures occupying the very thrones of the sovereigns of
England, the low growl was repeated, and a great male rose slowly
to his feet.</p>

<p>His devilish eyes bored straight through the semi-darkness
toward us. He had discovered the interloper. What right had man
within this palace of the beasts? Again he opened his giant jaws,
and this time there rumbled forth a warning roar.</p>

<p>Instantly eight or ten of the other beasts leaped to their feet.
Already the great fellow who had spied us was advancing slowly in
our direction. I held my rifle ready, but how futile it appeared in
the face of this savage horde.</p>

<p>The foremost beast broke into a slow trot, and at his heels came
the others. All were roaring now, and the din of their great voices
reverberating through the halls and corridors of the palace formed
the most frightful chorus of thunderous savagery imaginable to the
mind of man.</p>

<p>And then the leader charged, and upon the hideous pandemonium
broke the sharp crack of my rifle, once, twice, thrice. Three lions
rolled, struggling and biting, to the floor. Victory seized my arm,
with a quick, "This way! Here is a door," and a moment later we
were in a tiny antechamber at the foot of a narrow stone
staircase.</p>

<p>Up this we backed, Victory just behind me, as the first of the
remaining lions leaped from the throne room and sprang for the
stairs. Again I fired, but others of the ferocious beasts leaped
over their fallen fellows and pursued us.</p>

<p>The stairs were very narrow&mdash;that was all that saved
us&mdash;for as I backed slowly upward, but a single lion could
attack me at a time, and the carcasses of those I slew impeded the
rushes of the others.</p>

<p>At last we reached the top. There was a long corridor from which
opened many doorways. One, directly behind us, was tight closed. If
we could open it and pass into the chamber behind we might find a
respite from attack.</p>

<p>The remaining lions were roaring horribly. I saw one sneaking
very slowly up the stairs toward us.</p>

<p>"Try that door," I called to Victory. "See if it will open."</p>

<p>She ran up to it and pushed.</p>

<p>"Turn the knob!" I cried, seeing that she did not know how to
open a door, but neither did she know what I meant by knob.</p>

<p>I put a bullet in the spine of the approaching lion and leaped
to Victory's side. The door resisted my first efforts to swing it
inward. Rusted hinges and swollen wood held it tightly closed. But
at last it gave, and just as another lion mounted to the top of the
stairway it swung in, and I pushed Victory across the
threshold.</p>

<p>Then I turned to meet the renewed attack of the savage foe. One
lion fell in his tracks, another stumbled to my very feet, and then
I leaped within and slammed the portal to.</p>

<p>A quick glance showed me that this was the only door to the
small apartment in which we had found sanctuary, and, with a sigh
of relief, I leaned for a moment against the panels of the stout
barrier that separated us from the ramping demons without.</p>

<p>Across the room, between two windows, stood a flat-topped desk.
A little pile of white and brown lay upon it close to the opposite
edge. After a moment of rest I crossed the room to investigate. The
white was the bleached human bones&mdash;the skull, collar bones,
arms, and a few of the upper ribs of a man. The brown was the dust
of a decayed military cap and blouse. In a chair before the desk
were other bones, while more still strewed the floor beneath the
desk and about the chair. A man had died sitting there with his
face buried in his arms&mdash;two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Beneath the desk were a pair of spurred military boots, green
and rotten with decay. In them were the leg bones of a man. Among
the tiny bones of the hands was an ancient fountain pen, as good,
apparently, as the day it was made, and a metal covered memoranda
book, closed over the bones of an index finger.</p>

<p>It was a gruesome sight&mdash;a pitiful sight&mdash;this lone
inhabitant of mighty London.</p>

<p>I picked up the metal-covered memoranda book. Its pages were
rotten and stuck together. Only here and there was a sentence or a
part of a sentence legible. The first that I could read was near
the middle of the little volume:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"His majesty left for Tunbridge Wells today,
he&mdash;jesty was stricken&mdash;terday. God give she does not
die&mdash;am military governor of Lon&mdash;"</p>
<br>

<p>And farther on:</p>

<p class="letter">"It is awful&mdash;hundred deaths
today&mdash;worse than the bombardm&mdash;"</p>
<br>

<p>Nearer the end I picked out the following:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I promised his maj&mdash;he will find me here
when he ret&mdash;alone."</p>
<br>

<p>The most legible passage was on the next page:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"Thank God we drove them out. There is not a
single&mdash;man on British soil today; but at what awful cost. I
tried to persuade Sir Phillip to urge the people to remain. But
they are mad with fear of the Death, and rage at our enemies. He
tells me that the coast cities are packed&mdash;waiting to be taken
across. What will become of England, with none left to rebuild her
shattered cities!"</p>
<br>

<p>And the last entry:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"&mdash;alone. Only the wild beasts&mdash;A lion
is roaring now beneath the palace windows. I think the people
feared the beasts even more than they did the Death. But they are
gone, all gone, and to what? How much better conditions will they
find on the continent? All gone&mdash;only I remain. I promised his
majesty, and when he returns he will find that I was true to my
trust, for I shall be awaiting him. God save the King!"</p>
<br>

<p>That was all. This brave and forever nameless officer died nobly
at his post&mdash;true to his country and his king. It was the
Death, no doubt, that took him.</p>

<p>Some of the entries had been dated. From the few legible letters
and figures which remained I judge the end came some time in
August, 1937, but of that I am not at all certain.</p>

<p>The diary has cleared up at least one mystery that had puzzled
me not a little, and now I am surprised that I had not guessed its
solution myself&mdash;the presence of African and Asiatic beasts in
England.</p>

<p>Acclimated by years of confinement in the zoological gardens,
they were fitted to resume in England the wild existence for which
nature had intended them, and once free, had evidently bred
prolifically, in marked contrast to the captive exotics of
twentieth century Pan-America, which had gradually become fewer
until extinction occurred some time during the twenty-first
century.</p>

<p>The palace, if such it was, lay not far from the banks of the
Thames. The room in which we were imprisoned overlooked the river,
and I determined to attempt to escape in this direction.</p>

<p>To descend through the palace was out of the question, but
outside we could discover no lions. The stems of the ivy which
clambered upward past the window of the room were as large around
as my arm. I knew that they would support our weight, and as we
could gain nothing by remaining longer in the palace, I decided to
descend by way of the ivy and follow along down the river in the
direction of the launch.</p>

<p>Naturally I was much handicapped by the presence of the girl.
But I could not abandon her, though I had no idea what I should do
with her after rejoining my companions. That she would prove a
burden and an embarrassment I was certain, but she had made it
equally plain to me that she would never return to her people to
mate with Buckingham.</p>

<p>I owed my life to her, and, all other considerations aside, that
was sufficient demand upon my gratitude and my honor to necessitate
my suffering every inconvenience in her service. Too, she was queen
of England. But, by far the most potent argument in her favor, she
was a woman in distress&mdash;and a young and very beautiful
one.</p>

<p>And so, though I wished a thousand times that she was back in
her camp, I never let her guess it, but did all that lay within my
power to serve and protect her. I thank God now that I did so.</p>

<p>With the lions still padding back and forth beyond the closed
door, Victory and I crossed the room to one of the windows. I had
outlined my plan to her, and she had assured me that she could
descend the ivy without assistance. In fact, she smiled a trifle at
my question.</p>

<p>Swinging myself outward, I began the descent, and had come to
within a few feet of the ground, being just opposite a narrow
window, when I was startled by a savage growl almost in my ear, and
then a great taloned paw darted from the aperture to seize me, and
I saw the snarling face of a lion within the embrasure.</p>

<p>Releasing my hold upon the ivy, I dropped the remaining distance
to the ground, saved from laceration only because the lion's paw
struck the thick stem of ivy.</p>

<p>The creature was making a frightful racket now, leaping back and
forth from the floor at the broad window ledge, tearing at the
masonry with his claws in vain attempts to reach me. But the
opening was too narrow, and the masonry too solid.</p>

<p>Victory had commenced the descent, but I called to her to stop
just above the window, and, as the lion reappeared, growling and
snarling, I put a .33 bullet in his face, and at the same moment
Victory slipped quickly past him, dropping into my upraised arms
that were awaiting her.</p>

<p>The roaring of the beasts that had discovered us, together with
the report of my rifle, had set the balance of the fierce inmates
of the palace into the most frightful uproar I have ever heard.</p>

<p>I feared that it would not be long before intelligence or
instinct would draw them from the interiors and set them upon our
trail, the river. Nor had we much more than reached it when a lion
bounded around the corner of the edifice we had just quitted and
stood looking about as though in search of us.</p>

<p>Following, came others, while Victory and I crouched in hiding
behind a clump of bushes close to the bank of the river. The beasts
sniffed about the ground for a while, but they did not chance to go
near the spot where we had stood beneath the window that had given
us escape.</p>

<p>Presently a black-maned male raised his head, and, with cocked
ears and glaring eyes, gazed straight at the bush behind which we
lay. I could have sworn that he had discovered us, and when he took
a few short and stately steps in our direction I raised my rifle
and covered him. But, after a long, tense moment he looked away,
and turned to glare in another direction.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief, and so did Victory. I could feel
her body quiver as she lay pressed close to me, our cheeks almost
touching as we both peered through the same small opening in the
foliage.</p>

<p>I turned to give her a reassuring smile as the lion indicated
that he had not seen us, and as I did so she, too, turned her face
toward mine, for the same purpose, doubtless. Anyway, as our heads
turned simultaneously, our lips brushed together. A startled
expression came into Victory's eyes as she drew back in evident
confusion.</p>

<p>As for me, the strangest sensation that I have ever experienced
claimed me for an instant. A peculiar, tingling thrill ran through
my veins, and my head swam. I could not account for it.</p>

<p>Naturally, being a naval officer and consequently in the best
society of the federation, I have seen much of women. With others,
I have laughed at the assertions of the savants that modern man is
a cold and passionless creation in comparison with the males of
former ages&mdash;in a word, that love, as the one grand passion,
had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>I do not know, now, but that they were more nearly right than we
have guessed, at least in so far as modern civilized woman is
concerned. I have kissed many women&mdash;young and beautiful and
middle aged and old, and many that I had no business
kissing&mdash;but never before had I experienced that remarkable
and altogether delightful thrill that followed the accidental
brushing of my lips against the lips of Victory.</p>

<p>The occurrence interested me, and I was tempted to experiment
further. But when I would have essayed it another new and entirely
unaccountable force restrained me. For the first time in my life I
felt embarrassment in the presence of a woman.</p>

<p>What further might have developed I cannot say, for at that
moment a perfect she-devil of a lioness, with keener eyes than her
lord and master, discovered us. She came trotting toward our place
of concealment, growling and baring her yellow fangs.</p>

<p>I waited for an instant, hoping that I might be mistaken, and
that she would turn off in some other direction. But no&mdash;she
increased her trot to a gallop, and then I fired at her, but the
bullet, though it struck her full in the breast, didn't stop
her.</p>

<p>Screaming with pain and rage, the creature fairly flew toward
us. Behind her came other lions. Our case looked hopeless. We were
upon the brink of the river. There seemed no avenue of escape, and
I knew that even my modern automatic rifle was inadequate in the
face of so many of these fierce beasts.</p>

<p>To remain where we were would have been suicidal. We were both
standing now, Victory keeping her place bravely at my side, when I
reached the only decision open to me.</p>

<p>Seizing the girl's hand, I turned, just as the lioness crashed
into the opposite side of the bushes, and, dragging Victory after
me, leaped over the edge of the bank into the river.</p>

<p>I did not know that lions are not fond of water, nor did I know
if Victory could swim, but death, immediate and terrible, stared us
in the face if we remained, and so I took the chance.</p>

<p>At this point the current ran close to the shore, so that we
were immediately in deep water, and, to my intense satisfaction,
Victory struck out with a strong, overhand stroke and set all my
fears on her account at rest.</p>

<p>But my relief was short-lived. That lioness, as I have said
before, was a veritable devil. She stood for a moment glaring at
us, then like a shot she sprang into the river and swam swiftly
after us.</p>

<p>Victory was a length ahead of me.</p>

<p>"Swim for the other shore!" I called to her.</p>

<p>I was much impeded by my rifle, having to swim with one hand
while I clung to my precious weapon with the other. The girl had
seen the lioness take to the water, and she had also seen that I
was swimming much more slowly than she, and what did she do? She
started to drop back to my side.</p>

<p>"Go on!" I cried. "Make for the other shore, and then follow
down until you find my friends. Tell them that I sent you, and with
orders that they are to protect you. Go on! Go on!"</p>

<p>But she only waited until we were again swimming side by side,
and I saw that she had drawn her long knife, and was holding it
between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you!" I said to her sharply, but she shook her
head.</p>

<p>The lioness was overhauling us rapidly. She was swimming
silently, her chin just touching the water, but blood was streaming
from between her lips. It was evident that her lungs were
pierced.</p>

<p>She was almost upon me. I saw that in a moment she would take me
under her forepaws, or seize me in those great jaws. I felt that my
time had come, but I meant to die fighting. And so I turned, and,
treading water, raised my rifle above my head and awaited her.</p>

<p>Victory, animated by a bravery no less ferocious than that of
the dumb beast assailing us, swam straight for me. It all happened
so swiftly that I cannot recall the details of the kaleidoscopic
action which ensued. I knew that I rose high out of the water, and,
with clubbed rifle, dealt the animal a terrific blow upon the
skull, that I saw Victory, her long blade flashing in her hand,
close, striking, upon the beast, that a great paw fell upon her
shoulder, and that I was swept beneath the surface of the water
like a straw before the prow of a freighter.</p>

<p>Still clinging to my rifle, I rose again, to see the lioness
struggling in her death throes but an arm's length from me.
Scarcely had I risen than the beast turned upon her side, struggled
frantically for an instant, and then sank.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">VICTORY was nowhere in sight. Alone, I floated
upon the bosom of the Thames. In that brief instant I believe that
I suffered more mental anguish than I have crowded into all the
balance of my life before or since. A few hours before, I had been
wishing that I might be rid of her, and now that she was gone I
would have given my life to have her back again.</p>

<p>Wearily I turned to swim about the spot where she had
disappeared, hoping that she might rise once at least, and I would
be given the opportunity to save her, and, as I turned, the water
boiled before my face and her head shot up before me. I was on the
point of striking out to seize her, when a happy smile illumined
her features.</p>

<p>"You are not dead!" she cried. "I have been searching the bottom
for you. I was sure that the blow she gave you must have disabled
you," and she glanced about for the lioness.</p>

<p>"She has gone?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Dead," I replied.</p>

<p>"The blow you struck her with the thing you call rifle stunned
her," she explained, "and then I swam in close enough to get my
knife into her heart."</p>

<p>Ah, such a girl! I could not but wonder what one of our own
Pan-American women would have done under like circumstances. But
then, of course, they have not been trained by stern necessity to
cope with the emergencies and dangers of savage primeval life.</p>

<p>Along the bank we had just quitted, a score of lions paced to
and fro, growling menacingly. We could not return, and we struck
out for the opposite shore. I am a strong swimmer, and had no doubt
as to my ability to cross the river, but I was not so sure about
Victory, so I swam close behind her, to be ready to give her
assistance should she need it.</p>

<p>She did not, however, reaching the opposite bank as fresh,
apparently, as when she entered the water. Victory is a wonder.
Each day that we were together brought new proofs of it. Nor was it
her courage or vitality only which amazed me. She had a head on
those shapely shoulders of hers, and dignity! My, but she could be
regal when she chose!</p>

<p>She told me that the lions were fewer upon this side of the
river, but that there were many wolves, running in great packs
later in the year. Now they were north somewhere, and we should
have little to fear from them, though we might meet with a few.</p>

<p>My first concern was to take my weapons apart and dry them,
which was rather difficult in the face of the fact that every rag
about me was drenched. But finally, thanks to the sun and much
rubbing, I succeeded, though I had no oil to lubricate them.</p>

<p>We ate some wild berries and roots that Victory found, and then
we set off again down the river, keeping an eye open for game on
one side and the launch on the other, for I thought that Delcarte,
who would be the natural leader during my absence, might run up the
Thames in search of me.</p>

<p>The balance of that day we sought in vain for game or for the
launch, and when night came we lay down, our stomachs empty, to
sleep beneath the stars. We were entirely unprotected from attack
from wild beasts, and for this reason I remained awake most of the
night, on guard. But nothing approached us, though I could hear the
lions roaring across the river, and once I thought I heard the howl
of a beast north of us&mdash;it might have been a wolf.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a most unpleasant night, and I determined
then that if we were forced to sleep out again that I should
provide some sort of shelter which would protect us from attack
while we slept.</p>

<p>Toward morning I dozed, and the sun was well up when Victory
aroused me by gently shaking my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Antelope!" she whispered in my ear, and, as I raised my head,
she pointed up-river. Crawling to my knees, I looked in the
direction she indicated, to see a buck standing upon a little knoll
some two hundred yards from us. There was good cover between the
animal and me, and so, though I might have hit him at two hundred
yards, I preferred to crawl closer to him and make sure of the meat
we both so craved.</p>

<p>I had covered about fifty yards of the distance, and the beast
was still feeding peacefully, so I thought that I would make even
surer of a hit by going ahead another fifty yards, when the animal
suddenly raised his head and looked away, up-river. His whole
attitude proclaimed that he was startled by something beyond him
that I could not see.</p>

<p>Realizing that he might break and run and that I should then
probably miss him entirely, I raised my rifle to my shoulder. But
even as I did so the animal leaped into the air, and simultaneously
there was a sound of a shot from beyond the knoll.</p>

<p>For an instant I was dumbfounded. Had the report come from
down-river, I should have instantly thought that one of my own men
had fired. But coming from up-river it puzzled me considerably. Who
could there be with firearms in primitive England other than we of
the <i>Coldwater</i>?</p>

<p>Victory was directly behind me, and I motioned for her to lie
down, as I did, behind the bush from which I had been upon the
point of firing at the antelope. We could see that the buck was
quite dead, and from our hiding place we waited to discover the
identity of his slayer when the latter should approach and claim
his kill.</p>

<p>We had not long to wait, and when I saw the head and shoulders
of a man appear above the crest of the knoll, I sprang to my feet,
with a heartfelt cry of joy, for it was Delcarte.</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice, Delcarte half raised his rifle in
readiness for the attack of an enemy, but a moment later he
recognized me, and was coming rapidly to meet us. Behind him was
Snider. They both were astounded to see me upon the north bank of
the river, and much more so at the sight of my companion.</p>

<p>Then I introduced them to Victory, and told them that she was
queen of England. They thought, at first, that I was joking. But
when I had recounted my adventures and they realized that I was in
earnest, they believed me.</p>

<p>They told me that they had followed me inshore when I had not
returned from the hunt, that they had met the men of the elephant
country, and had had a short and one-sided battle with the fellows.
And that afterward they had returned to the launch with a prisoner,
from whom they had learned that I had probably been captured by the
men of the lion country.</p>

<p>With the prisoner as a guide they had set off up-river in search
of me, but had been much delayed by motor trouble, and had finally
camped after dark a half mile above the spot where Victory and I
had spent the night. They must have passed us in the dark, and why
I did not hear the sound of the propeller I do not know, unless it
passed me at a time when the lions were making an unusually
earsplitting din upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>Taking the antelope with us, we all returned to the launch,
where we found Taylor as delighted to see me alive again as
Delcarte had been. I cannot say truthfully that Snider evinced much
enthusiasm at my rescue.</p>

<p>Taylor had found the ingredients for chemical fuel, and the
distilling of them had, with the motor trouble, accounted for their
delay in setting out after me.</p>

<p>The prisoner that Delcarte and Snider had taken was a powerful
young fellow from the elephant country. Notwithstanding the fact
that they had all assured him to the contrary, he still could not
believe that we would not kill him.</p>

<p>He assured us that his name was Thirty-six, and, as he could not
count above ten, I am sure that he had no conception of the correct
meaning of the word, and that it may have been handed down to him
either from the military number of an ancestor who had served in
the English ranks during the Great War, or that originally it was
the number of some famous regiment with which a forbear fought.</p>

<p>Now that we were reunited, we held a council to determine what
course we should pursue in the immediate future. Snider was still
for setting out to sea and returning to Pan-America, but the better
judgment of Delcarte and Taylor ridiculed the suggestion&mdash;we
should not have lived a fortnight.</p>

<p>To remain in England, constantly menaced by wild beasts and men
equally as wild, seemed about as bad. I suggested that we cross the
Channel and ascertain if we could not discover a more enlightened
and civilized people upon the continent. I was sure that some trace
of the ancient culture and greatness of Europe must remain.
Germany, probably, would be much as it was during the twentieth
century, for, in common with most Pan-Americans, I was positive
that Germany had been victorious in the Great War.</p>

<p>Snider demurred at the suggestion. He said that it was bad
enough to have come this far. He did not want to make it worse by
going to the continent. The outcome of it was that I finally lost
my patience, and told him that from then on he would do what I
thought best&mdash;that I proposed to assume command of the party,
and that they might all consider themselves under my orders, as
much so as though we were still aboard the <i>Coldwater</i> and in
Pan-American waters.</p>

<p>Delcarte and Taylor immediately assured me that they had not for
an instant assumed anything different, and that they were as ready
to follow and obey me here as they would be upon the other side of
thirty.</p>

<p>Snider said nothing, but he wore a sullen scowl. And I wished
then, as I had before, and as I did to a much greater extent later,
that fate had not decreed that he should have chanced to be a
member of the launch's party upon that memorable day when last we
quitted the <i>Coldwater</i>.</p>

<p>Victory, who was given a voice in our councils, was all for
going to the continent, or anywhere else, in fact, where she might
see new sights and experience new adventures.</p>

<p>"Afterward we can come back to Grabritin," she said, "and if
Buckingham is not dead and we can catch him away from his men and
kill him, then I can return to my people, and we can all live in
peace and happiness."</p>

<p>She spoke of killing Buckingham with no greater concern than one
might evince in the contemplated destruction of a sheep; yet she
was neither cruel nor vindictive. In fact, Victory is a very sweet
and womanly woman. But human life is of small account beyond
thirty&mdash;a legacy from the bloody days when thousands of men
perished in the trenches between the rising and the setting of a
sun, when they laid them lengthwise in these same trenches and
sprinkled dirt over them, when the Germans corded their corpses
like wood and set fire to them, when women and children and old men
were butchered, and great passenger ships were torpedoed without
warning.</p>

<p>Thirty-six, finally assured that we did not intend slaying him,
was as keen to accompany us as was Victory.</p>

<p>The crossing to the continent was uneventful, its monotony being
relieved, however, by the childish delight of Victory and
Thirty-six in the novel experience of riding safely upon the bosom
of the water, and of being so far from land.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of Snider, the little party appeared
in the best of spirits, laughing and joking, or interestedly
discussing the possibilities which the future held for us: what we
should find upon the continent, and whether the inhabitants would
be civilized or barbarian peoples.</p>

<p>Victory asked me to explain the difference between the two, and
when I had tried to do so as clearly as possible, she broke into a
gay little laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "then I am a barbarian!"</p>

<p>I could not but laugh, too, as I admitted that she was, indeed,
a barbarian. She was not offended, taking the matter as a huge
joke. But some time thereafter she sat in silence, apparently deep
in thought. Finally she looked up at me, her strong white teeth
gleaming behind her smiling lips.</p>

<p>"Should you take that thing you call 'razor,'" she said, "and
cut the hair from the face of Thirty-six, and exchange garments
with him, you would be the barbarian and Thirty-six the civilized
man. There is no other difference between you, except your weapons.
Clothe you in a wolfskin, give you a knife and a spear, and set you
down in the woods of Grabritin&mdash;of what service would your
civilization be to you?"</p>

<p>Delcarte and Taylor smiled at her reply, but Thirty-six and
Snider laughed uproariously. I was not surprised at Thirty-six, but
I thought that Snider laughed louder than the occasion warranted.
As a matter of fact, Snider, it seemed to me, was taking advantage
of every opportunity, however slight, to show insubordination, and
I determined then that at the first real breach of discipline I
should take action that would remind Snider, ever after, that I was
still his commanding officer.</p>

<p>I could not help but notice that his eyes were much upon
Victory, and I did not like it, for I knew the type of man he was.
But as it would not be necessary ever to leave the girl alone with
him I felt no apprehension for her safety.</p>

<p>After the incident of the discussion of barbarians I thought
that Victory's manner toward me changed perceptibly. She held aloof
from me, and when Snider took his turn at the wheel, sat beside
him, upon the pretext that she wished to learn how to steer the
launch. I wondered if she had guessed the man's antipathy for me,
and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of piquing
me.</p>

<p>Snider was, too, taking full advantage of his opportunity. Often
he leaned toward the girl to whisper in her ear, and he laughed
much, which was unusual with Snider.</p>

<p>Of course, it was nothing at all to me; yet, for some
unaccountable reason, the sight of the two of them sitting there so
close to one another and seeming to be enjoying each other's
society to such a degree irritated me tremendously, and put me in
such a bad humor that I took no pleasure whatsoever in the last few
hours of the crossing.</p>

<p>We aimed to land near the site of ancient Ostend. But when we
neared the coast we discovered no indication of any human
habitations whatever, let alone a city. After we had landed, we
found the same howling wilderness about us that we had discovered
on the British Isle. There was no slightest indication that
civilized man had ever set a foot upon that portion of the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Although I had feared as much, since our experience in England,
I could not but own to a feeling of marked disappointment, and to
the gravest fears of the future, which induced a mental depression
that was in no way dissipated by the continued familiarity between
Victory and Snider.</p>

<p>I was angry with myself that I permitted that matter to affect
me as it had. I did not wish to admit to myself that I was angry
with this uncultured little savage, that it made the slightest
difference to me what she did or what she did not do, or that I
could so lower myself as to feel personal enmity towards a common
sailor. And yet, to be honest, I was doing both.</p>

<p>Finding nothing to detain us about the spot where Ostend once
had stood, we set out up the coast in search of the mouth of the
River Rhine, which I purposed ascending in search of civilized man.
It was my intention to explore the Rhine as far up as the launch
would take us. If we found no civilization there we would return to
the North Sea, continue up the coast to the Elbe, and follow that
river and the canals of Berlin. Here, at least, I was sure that we
should find what we sought&mdash;and, if not, then all Europe had
reverted to barbarism.</p>

<p>The weather remained fine, and we made excellent progress, but
everywhere along the Rhine we met with the same
disappointment&mdash;no sign of civilized man, in fact, no sign of
man at all.</p>

<p>I was not enjoying the exploration of modern Europe as I had
anticipated&mdash;I was unhappy. Victory seemed changed, too. I had
enjoyed her company at first, but since the trip across the Channel
I had held aloof from her.</p>

<p>Her chin was in the air most of the time, and yet I rather think
that she regretted her friendliness with Snider, for I noticed that
she avoided him entirely. He, on the contrary, emboldened by her
former friendliness, sought every opportunity to be near her. I
should have liked nothing better than a reasonably good excuse to
punch his head; yet, paradoxically, I was ashamed of myself for
harboring him any ill will. I realized that there was something the
matter with me, but I did not know what it was.</p>

<p>Matters remained thus for several days, and we continued our
journey up the Rhine. At Cologne, I had hoped to find some
reassuring indications, but there was no Cologne. And as there had
been no other cities along the river up to that point, the
devastation was infinitely greater than time alone could have
wrought. Great guns, bombs, and mines must have leveled every
building that man had raised, and then nature, unhindered, had
covered the ghastly evidence of human depravity with her beauteous
mantle of verdure. Splendid trees reared their stately tops where
splendid cathedrals once had reared their domes, and sweet wild
flowers blossomed in simple serenity in soil that once was drenched
with human blood.</p>

<p>Nature had reclaimed what man had once stolen from her and
defiled. A herd of zebras grazed where once the German kaiser may
have reviewed his troops. An antelope rested peacefully in a bed of
daisies where, perhaps, two hundred years ago a big gun belched its
terror-laden messages of death, of hate, of destruction against the
works of man and God alike.</p>

<p>We were in need of fresh meat, yet I hesitated to shatter the
quiet and peaceful serenity of the view with the crack of a rifle
and the death of one of those beautiful creatures before us. But it
had to be done&mdash;we must eat. I left the work to Delcarte,
however, and in a moment we had two antelope and the landscape to
ourselves.</p>

<p>After eating, we boarded the launch and continued up the river.
For two days we passed through a primeval wilderness. In the
afternoon of the second day we landed upon the west bank of the
river, and, leaving Snider and Thirty-six to guard Victory and the
launch, Delcarte, Taylor, and I set out after game.</p>

<p>We tramped away from the river for upwards of an hour before
discovering anything, and then only a small red deer, which Taylor
brought down with a neat shot of two hundred yards. It was getting
too late to proceed farther, so we rigged a sling, and the two men
carried the deer back toward the launch while I walked a hundred
yards ahead, in the hope of bagging something further for our
larder.</p>

<p>We had covered about half the distance to the river, when I
suddenly came face to face with a man. He was as primitive and
uncouth in appearance as the Grabritins&mdash;a shaggy, unkempt
savage, clothed in a shirt of skin cured with the head on, the
latter surmounting his own head to form a bonnet, and giving to him
a most fearful and ferocious aspect.</p>

<p>The fellow was armed with a long spear and a club, the latter
dangling down his back from a leathern thong about his neck. His
feet were encased in hide sandals.</p>

<p>At sight of me, he halted for an instant, then turned and dove
into the forest, and, though I called reassuringly to him in
English he did not return nor did I again see him.</p>

<p>The sight of the wild man raised my hopes once more that
elsewhere we might find men in a higher state of
civilization&mdash;it was the society of civilized man that I
craved&mdash;and so, with a lighter heart, I continued on toward
the river and the launch.</p>

<p>I was still some distance ahead of Delcarte and Taylor, when I
came in sight of the Rhine again. But I came to the water's edge
before I noticed that anything was amiss with the party we had left
there a few hours before.</p>

<p>My first intimation of disaster was the absence of the launch
from its former moorings. And then, a moment later&mdash;I
discovered the body of a man lying upon the bank. Running toward
it, I saw that it was Thirty-six, and as I stopped and raised the
Grabritin's head in my arms, I heard a faint moan break from his
lips. He was not dead, but that he was badly injured was all too
evident.</p>

<p>Delcarte and Taylor came up a moment later, and the three of us
worked over the fellow, hoping to revive him that he might tell us
what had happened, and what had become of the others. My first
thought was prompted by the sight I had recently had of the savage
native. The little party had evidently been surprised, and in the
attack Thirty-six had been wounded and the others taken prisoners.
The thought was almost like a physical blow in the face&mdash;it
stunned me. Victory in the hands of these abysmal brutes! It was
frightful. I almost shook poor Thirty-six in my efforts to revive
him.</p>

<p>I explained my theory to the others, and then Delcarte shattered
it by a single movement of the hand. He drew aside the lion's skin
that covered half of the Grabritin's breast, revealing a neat,
round hole in Thirty-six's chest&mdash;a hole that could have been
made by no other weapon than a rifle.</p>

<p>"Snider!" I exclaimed. Delcarte nodded. At about the same time
the eyelids of the wounded man fluttered, and raised. He looked up
at us, and very slowly the light of consciousness returned to his
eyes.</p>

<p>"What happened, Thirty-six?" I asked him.</p>

<p>He tried to reply, but the effort caused him to cough, bringing
about a hemorrhage of the lungs and again he fell back exhausted.
For several long minutes he lay as one dead, then in an almost
inaudible whisper he spoke.</p>

<p>"Snider&mdash;" He paused, tried to speak again, raised a hand,
and pointed down-river. "They&mdash;went&mdash;back," and then he
shuddered convulsively and died.</p>

<p>None of us voiced his belief. But I think they were all alike:
Victory and Snider had stolen the launch, and deserted us.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WE stood there, grouped about the body of the dead
Grabritin, looking futilely down the river to where it made an
abrupt curve to the west, a quarter of a mile below us, and was
lost to sight, as though we expected to see the truant returning to
us with our precious launch&mdash;the thing that meant life or
death to us in this unfriendly, savage world.</p>

<p>I felt, rather than saw, Taylor turn his eyes slowly toward my
profile, and, as mine swung to meet them, the expression upon his
face recalled me to my duty and responsibility as an officer.</p>

<p>The utter hopelessness that was reflected in his face must have
been the counterpart of what I myself felt, but in that brief
instant I determined to hide my own misgivings that I might bolster
up the courage of the others.</p>

<p>"We are lost!" was written as plainly upon Taylor's face as
though his features were the printed words upon an open book. He
was thinking of the launch, and of the launch alone. Was I? I tried
to think that I was. But a greater grief than the loss of the
launch could have engendered in me, filled my heart&mdash;a sullen,
gnawing misery which I tried to deny&mdash;which I refused to
admit&mdash;but which persisted in obsessing me until my heart rose
and filled my throat, and I could not speak when I would have
uttered words of reassurance to my companions.</p>

<p>And then rage came to my relief&mdash;rage against the vile
traitor who had deserted three of his fellow countrymen in so
frightful a position. I tried to feel an equal rage against the
woman, but somehow I could not, and kept searching for excuses for
her&mdash;her youth, her inexperience, her savagery.</p>

<p>My rising anger swept away my temporary helplessness. I smiled,
and told Taylor not to look so glum.</p>

<p>"We will follow them," I said, "and the chances are that we
shall overtake them. They will not travel as rapidly as Snider
probably hopes. He will be forced to halt for fuel and for food,
and the launch must follow the windings of the river; we can take
short cuts while they are traversing the detour. I have my
map&mdash;thank God! I always carry it upon my person&mdash;and
with that and the compass we will have an advantage over them."</p>

<p>My words seemed to cheer them both, and they were for starting
off at once in pursuit. There was no reason why we should delay,
and we set forth down the river. As we tramped along, we discussed
a question that was uppermost in the mind of each&mdash;what we
should do with Snider when we had captured him, for with the action
of pursuit had come the optimistic conviction that we should
succeed. As a matter of fact, we had to succeed. The very thought
of remaining in this utter wilderness for the rest of our lives was
impossible.</p>

<p>We arrived at nothing very definite in the matter of Snider's
punishment, since Taylor was for shooting him, Delcarte insisting
that he should be hanged, while I, although fully conscious of the
gravity of his offense, could not bring myself to give the death
penalty.</p>

<p>I fell to wondering what charm Victory had found in such a man
as Snider, and why I insisted upon finding excuses for her and
trying to defend her indefensible act. She was nothing to me. Aside
from the natural gratitude I felt for her since she had saved my
life, I owed her nothing. She was a half-naked little
savage&mdash;I, a gentleman, and an officer in the world's greatest
navy. There could be no close bonds of interest between us.</p>

<p>This line of reflection I discovered to be as distressing as the
former, but, though I tried to turn my mind to other things, it
persisted in returning to the vision of an oval face, sun-tanned;
of smiling lips, revealing white and even teeth; of brave eyes that
harbored no shadow of guile; and of a tumbling mass of wavy hair
that crowned the loveliest picture on which my eyes had ever
rested.</p>

<p>Every time this vision presented itself I felt myself turn cold
with rage and hate against Snider. I could forgive the launch, but
if he had wronged her he should die&mdash;he should die at my own
hands; in this I was determined.</p>

<p>For two days we followed the river northward, cutting off where
we could, but confined for the most part to the game trails that
paralleled the stream. One afternoon, we cut across a narrow neck
of land that saved us many miles, where the river wound to the west
and back again.</p>

<p>Here we decided to halt, for we had had a hard day of it, and,
if the truth were known, I think that we had all given up hope of
overtaking the launch other than by the merest accident.</p>

<p>We had shot a deer just before our halt, and, as Taylor and
Delcarte were preparing it, I walked down to the water to fill our
canteens. I had just finished, and was straightening up, when
something floating around a bend above me caught my eye. For a
moment I could not believe the testimony of my own senses. It was a
boat.</p>

<p>I shouted to Delcarte and Taylor, who came running to my
side.</p>

<p>"The launch!" cried Delcarte; and, indeed, it was the launch,
floating down-river from above us. Where had it been? How had we
passed it? And how were we to reach it now, should Snider and the
girl discover us?</p>

<p>"It's drifting," said Taylor. "I see no one in it."</p>

<p>I was stripping off my clothes, and Delcarte soon followed my
example. I told Taylor to remain on shore with the clothing and
rifles. He might also serve us better there, since it would give
him an opportunity to take a shot at Snider should the man discover
us and show himself.</p>

<p>With powerful strokes we swam out in the path of the oncoming
launch. Being a stronger swimmer than Delcarte, I soon was far in
the lead, reaching the center of the channel just as the launch
bore down upon me. It was drifting broadside on. I seized the
gunwale and raised myself quickly, so that my chin topped the side.
I expected a blow the moment that I came within the view of the
occupants, but no blow fell.</p>

<p>Snider lay upon his back in the bottom of the boat alone. Even
before I had clambered in and stooped above him I knew that he was
dead. Without examining him further, I ran forward to the control
board and pressed the starting button. To my relief, the mechanism
responded&mdash;the launch was uninjured. Coming about, I picked up
Delcarte. He was astounded at the sight that met his eyes, and
immediately fell to examining Snider's body for signs of life or an
explanation of the manner in which he met his death.</p>

<p>The fellow had been dead for hours&mdash;he was cold and still.
But Delcarte's search was not without results, for above Snider's
heart was a wound, a slit about an inch in length&mdash;such a slit
as a sharp knife would make, and in the dead fingers of one hand
was clutched a strand of long brown hair&mdash;Victory's hair was
brown.</p>

<p>They say that dead men tell no tales, but Snider told the story
of his end as clearly as though the dead lips had parted and poured
forth the truth. The beast had attacked the girl, and she had
defended her honor.</p>

<p>We buried Snider beside the Rhine, and no stone marks his last
resting place. Beasts do not require headstones.</p>

<p>Then we set out in the launch, turning her nose upstream. When I
had told Delcarte and Taylor that I intended searching for the
girl, neither had demurred.</p>

<p>"We had her wrong in our thoughts," said Delcarte, "and the
least that we can do in expiation is to find and rescue her."</p>

<p>We called her name aloud every few minutes as we motored up the
river, but, though we returned all the way to our former camping
place, we did not find her. I then decided to retrace our journey,
letting Taylor handle the launch, while Delcarte and I, upon
opposite sides of the river, searched for some sign of the spot
where Victory had landed.</p>

<p>We found nothing until we had reached a point a few miles above
the spot where I had first seen the launch drifting down toward us,
and there I discovered the remnants of a recent camp fire.</p>

<p>That Victory carried flint and steel I was aware, and that it
was she who built the fire I was positive. But which way had she
gone since she stopped here?</p>

<p>Would she go on down the river, that she might thus bring
herself nearer her own Grabritin, or would she have sought to
search for us upstream, where she had seen us last?</p>

<p>I had hailed Taylor, and sent him across the river to take in
Delcarte, that the two might join me and discuss my discovery and
our future plans.</p>

<p>While waiting for them, I stood looking out over the river, my
back toward the woods that stretched away to the east behind me.
Delcarte was just stepping into the launch upon the opposite side
of the stream, when, without the least warning, I was violently
seized by both arms and about the waist&mdash;three or four men
were upon me at once; my rifle was snatched from my hands and my
revolver from my belt.</p>

<p>I struggled for an instant, but finding my efforts of no avail,
I ceased them, and turned my head to have a look at my assailants.
At the same time several others of them walked around in front of
me, and, to my astonishment, I found myself looking upon uniformed
soldiery, armed with rifles, revolvers, and sabers, but with faces
as black as coal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DELCORTE and Taylor were now in mis-stream, coming
toward us, and I called to them to keep aloof until I knew whether
the intentions of my captors were friendly or otherwise. My good
men wanted to come on and annihilate the blacks. But there were
upward of a hundred of the latter, all well armed, and so I
commanded Delcarte to keep out of harm's way, and stay where he was
till I needed him.</p>

<p>A young officer called and beckoned to them. But they refused to
come, and so he gave orders that resulted in my hands being secured
at my back, after which the company marched away, straight toward
the east.</p>

<p>I noticed that the men wore spurs, which seemed strange to me.
But when, late in the afternoon, we arrived at their encampment, I
discovered that my captors were cavalrymen.</p>

<p>In the center of a plain stood a log fort, with a block-house at
each of its four corners. As we approached, I saw a herd of cavalry
horses grazing under guard outside the walls of the post. They were
small, stocky horses, but the telltale saddle galls proclaimed
their calling. The flag flying from a tall staff inside the
palisade was one which I had never before seen nor heard of.</p>

<p>We marched directly into the compound, where the company was
dismissed, with the exception of a guard of four privates, who
escorted me in the wake of the young officer. The latter led us
across a small parade ground, where a battery of light field guns
was parked, and toward a log building, in front of which rose the
flagstaff.</p>

<p>I was escorted within the building into the presence of an old
negro, a fine looking man, with a dignified and military bearing.
He was a colonel, I was to learn later, and to him I owe the very
humane treatment that was accorded me while I remained his
prisoner.</p>

<p>He listened to the report of his junior, and then turned to
question me, but with no better results than the former had
accomplished. Then he summoned an orderly, and gave some
instructions. The soldier saluted, and left the room, returning in
about five minutes with a hairy old white man&mdash;just such a
savage, primeval-looking fellow as I had discovered in the woods
the day that Snider had disappeared with the launch.</p>

<p>The colonel evidently expected to use the fellow as interpreter,
but when the savage addressed me it was in a language as foreign to
me as was that of the blacks. At last the old officer gave it up,
and, shaking his head, gave instructions for my removal.</p>

<p>From his office I was led to a guardhouse, in which I found
about fifty half-naked whites, clad in the skins of wild beasts. I
tried to converse with them, but not one of them could understand
Pan-American, nor could I make head or tail of their jargon.</p>

<p>For over a month I remained a prisoner there, working from
morning until night at odd jobs about the headquarters building of
the commanding officer. The other prisoners worked harder than I
did, and I owe my better treatment solely to the kindliness and
discrimination of the old colonel.</p>

<p>What had become of Victory, of Delcarte, of Taylor I could not
know; nor did it seem likely that I should ever learn. I was most
depressed. But I whiled away my time in performing the duties given
me to the best of my ability and attempting to learn the language
of my captors.</p>

<p>Who they were or where they came from was a mystery to me. That
they were the outpost of some powerful black nation seemed likely,
yet where the seat of that nation lay I could not guess.</p>

<p>They looked upon the whites as their inferiors, and treated us
accordingly. They had a literature of their own, and many of the
men, even the common soldiers, were omnivorous readers. Every two
weeks a dust-covered trooper would trot his jaded mount into the
post and deliver a bulging sack of mail at headquarters. The next
day he would be away again upon a fresh horse toward the south,
carrying the soldiers' letters to friends in the far off land of
mystery from whence they all had come.</p>

<p>Troops, sometimes mounted and sometimes afoot, left the post
daily for what I assumed to be patrol duty. I judged the little
force of a thousand men were detailed here to maintain the
authority of a distant government in a conquered country. Later, I
learned that my surmise was correct, and this was but one of a
great chain of similar posts that dotted the new frontier of the
black nation into whose hands I had fallen.</p>

<p>Slowly I learned their tongue, so that I could understand what
was said before me, and make myself understood. I had seen from the
first that I was being treated as a slave&mdash;that all whites
that fell into the hands of the blacks were thus treated.</p>

<p>Almost daily new prisoners were brought in, and about three
weeks after I was brought in to the post a troop of cavalry came
from the south to relieve one of the troops stationed there. There
was great jubilation in the encampment after the arrival of the
newcomers, old friendships were renewed and new ones made. But the
happiest men were those of the troop that was to be relieved.</p>

<p>The next morning they started away, and as they were forced upon
the parade ground we prisoners were marched from our quarters and
lined up before them. A couple of long chains were brought, with
rings in the links every few feet. At first I could not guess the
purpose of these chains. But I was soon to learn.</p>

<p>A couple of soldiers snapped the first ring around the neck of a
powerful white slave, and one by one the rest of us were herded to
our places, and the work of shackling us neck to neck
commenced.</p>

<p>The colonel stood watching the procedure. Presently his eyes
fell upon me, and he spoke to a young officer at his side. The
latter stepped toward me and motioned me to follow him. I did so,
and was led back to the colonel.</p>

<p>By this time I could understand a few words of their strange
language, and when the colonel asked me if I would prefer to remain
at the post as his body servant, I signified my willingness as
emphatically as possible, for I had seen enough of the brutality of
the common soldiers toward their white slaves to have no desire to
start out upon a march of unknown length, chained by the neck, and
driven on by the great whips that a score of the soldiers carried
to accelerate the speed of their charges.</p>

<p>About three hundred prisoners who had been housed in six prisons
at the post marched out of the gates that morning, toward what fate
and what future I could not guess. Neither had the poor devils
themselves more than the most vague conception of what lay in store
for them, except that they were going elsewhere to continue in the
slavery that they had known since their capture by their black
conquerors&mdash;a slavery that was to continue until death
released them.</p>

<p>My position was altered at the post. From working about the
headquarters office, I was transferred to the colonel's living
quarters. I had greater freedom, and no longer slept in one of the
prisons, but had a little room to myself off the kitchen of the
colonel's log house.</p>

<p>My master was always kind to me, and under him I rapidly learned
the language of my captors, and much concerning them that had been
a mystery to me before. His name was Abu Belik. He was a colonel in
the cavalry of Abyssinia, a country of which I do not remember ever
hearing, but which Colonel Belik assured me is the oldest civilized
country in the world.</p>

<p>Colonel Belik was born in Adis Abeba, the capital of the empire,
and until recently had been in command of the emperor's palace
guard. Jealousy and the ambition and intrigue of another officer
had lost him the favor of his emperor, and he had been detailed to
this frontier post as a mark of his sovereign's displeasure.</p>

<p>Some fifty years before, the young emperor, Menelek XIV, was
ambitious. He knew that a great world lay across the waters far to
the north of his capital. Once he had crossed the desert and looked
out upon the blue sea that was the northern boundary of his
dominions.</p>

<p>There lay another world to conquer. Menelek busied himself with
the building of a great fleet, though his people were not a
maritime race. His army crossed into Europe. It met with little
resistance, and for fifty years his soldiers had been pushing his
boundaries farther and farther toward the north.</p>

<p>"The yellow men from the east and north are contesting our
rights here now," said the colonel, "but we shall win&mdash;we
shall conquer the world, carrying Christianity to all the benighted
heathen of Europe, and Asia as well."</p>

<p>"You are a Christian people?" I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise, nodding his head affirmatively.</p>

<p>"I am a Christian," I said. "My people are the most powerful on
earth."</p>

<p>He smiled, and shook his head indulgently, as a father to a
child who sets up his childish judgment against that of his
elders.</p>

<p>Then I set out to prove my point. I told him of our cities, of
our army, of our great navy. He came right back at me asking for
figures, and when he was done I had to admit that only in our navy
were we numerically superior.</p>

<p>Menelek XIV is the undisputed ruler of all the continent of
Africa, of all of ancient Europe except the British Isles,
Scandinavia, and eastern Russia, and has large possessions and
prosperous colonies in what once were Arabia and Turkey in
Asia.</p>

<p>He has a standing army of ten million men, and his people
possess slaves&mdash;white slaves&mdash;to the number of ten or
fifteen million.</p>

<p>Colonel Belik was much surprised, however, upon his part to
learn of the great nation which lay across the ocean, and when he
found that I was a naval officer, he was inclined to accord me even
greater consideration than formerly. It was difficult for him to
believe my assertion that there were but few blacks in my country,
and that these occupied a lower social plane than the whites.</p>

<p>Just the reverse is true in Colonel Belik's land. He considered
whites inferior beings, creatures of a lower order, and assuring me
that even the few white freemen of Abyssinia were never accorded
anything approximating a position of social equality with the
blacks. They live in the poorer districts of the cities, in little
white colonies, and a black who marries a white is socially
ostracized.</p>

<p>The arms and ammunition of the Abyssinians are greatly inferior
to ours, yet they are tremendously effective against the ill-armed
barbarians of Europe. Their rifles are of a type similar to the
magazine rifles of twentieth century Pan-America, but carrying only
five cartridges in the magazine, in addition to the one in the
chamber. They are of extraordinary length, even those of the
cavalry, and are of extreme accuracy.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians themselves are a fine looking race of black
men&mdash;tall, muscular, with fine teeth, and regular features,
which incline distinctly toward Semitic mold&mdash;I refer to the
full-blooded natives of Abyssinia. They are the
patricians&mdash;the aristocracy. The army is officered almost
exclusively by them. Among the soldiery a lower type of negro
predominates, with thicker lips and broader, flatter noses. These
men are recruited, so the colonel told me, from among the conquered
tribes of Africa. They are good soldiers&mdash;brave and loyal.
They can read and write, and they are endowed with a
self-confidence and pride which, from my readings of the words of
ancient African explorers, must have been wanting in their earliest
progenitors. On the whole, it is apparent that the black race has
thrived far better in the past two centuries under men of its own
color than it had under the domination of whites during all
previous history.</p>

<p>I had been a prisoner at the little frontier post for over a
month, when orders came to Colonel Belik to hasten to the eastern
frontier with the major portion of his command, leaving only one
troop to garrison the fort. As his body servant, I accompanied him
mounted upon a fiery little Abyssinian pony.</p>

<p>We marched rapidly for ten days through the heart of the ancient
German empire, halting when night found us in proximity to water.
Often we passed small posts similar to that at which the colonel's
regiment had been quartered, finding in each instance that only a
single company or troop remained for defence, the balance having
been withdrawn toward the northeast, in the same direction in which
we were moving.</p>

<p>Naturally, the colonel had not confided to me the nature of his
orders. But the rapidity of our march and the fact that all
available troops were being hastened toward the northeast assured
me that a matter of vital importance to the dominion of Menelek XIV
in that part of Europe was threatening or had already broken.</p>

<p>I could not believe that a simple rising of the savage tribes of
whites would necessitate the mobilizing of such a force as we
presently met with converging from the south into our trail. There
were large bodies of cavalry and infantry, endless streams of
artillery wagons and guns, and countless horse-drawn covered
vehicles laden with camp equipage, munitions, and provisions.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time, I saw camels, great caravans of them,
bearing all sorts of heavy burdens, and miles upon miles of
elephants doing similar service. It was a scene of wondrous and
barbaric splendor, for the men and beasts from the south were gaily
caparisoned in rich colors, in marked contrast to the gray
uniformed forces of the frontier, with which I had been
familiar.</p>

<p>The rumor reached us that Menelek himself was coming, and the
pitch of excitement to which this announcement raised the troops
was little short of miraculous&mdash;at least, to one of my race
and nationality whose rulers for centuries had been but ordinary
men, holding office at the will of the people for a few brief
years.</p>

<p>As I witnessed it, I could not but speculate upon the moral
effect upon his troops of a sovereign's presence in the midst of
battle. All else being equal in war between the troops of a
republic and an empire, could not this exhilarated mental state,
amounting almost to hysteria on the part of the imperial troops,
weigh heavily against the soldiers of a president? I wonder.</p>

<p>But if the emperor chanced to be absent? What then? Again I
wonder.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day we reached our destination&mdash;a walled
frontier city of about twenty thousand. We passed some lakes, and
crossed some old canals before entering the gates. Within, beside
the frame buildings, were many built of ancient brick and well-cut
stone. These, I was told, were of material taken from the ruins of
the ancient city which, once, had stood upon the site of the
present town.</p>

<p>The name of the town, translated from the Abyssinian, is New
Gondar. It stands, I am convinced, upon the ruins of ancient
Berlin, the one time capital of the old German empire, but except
for the old building material used in the new town there is no sign
of the former city.</p>

<p>The day after we arrived, the town was gaily decorated with
flags, streamers, gorgeous rugs, and banners, for the rumor had
proved true&mdash;the emperor was coming.</p>

<p>Colonel Belik had accorded me the greatest liberty, permitting
me to go where I pleased, after my few duties had been performed.
As a result of his kindness, I spent much time wandering about New
Gondar, talking with the inhabitants, and exploring the city of
black men.</p>

<p>As I had been given a semi-military uniform which bore insignia
indicating that I was an officer's body servant, even the blacks
treated me with a species of respect, though I could see by their
manner that I was really as the dirt beneath their feet. They
answered my questions civilly enough, but they would not enter into
conversation with me. It was from other slaves that I learned the
gossip of the city.</p>

<p>Troops were pouring in from the west and south, and pouring out
toward the east. I asked an old slave who was sweeping the dirt
into little piles in the gutters of the street where the soldiers
were going. He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, to fight the yellow men, of course," he said. "They have
crossed the border, and are marching toward New Gondar."</p>

<p>"Who will win?" I asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows?" he said. "I hope it will
be the yellow men, but Menelek is powerful&mdash;it will take many
yellow men to defeat him."</p>

<p>Crowds were gathering along the sidewalks to view the emperor's
entry into the city. I took my place among them, although I hate
crowds, and I am glad that I did, for I witnessed such a spectacle
of barbaric splendor as no other Pan-American has ever looked
upon.</p>

<p>Down the broad main thoroughfare, which may once have been the
historic Unter den Linden, came a brilliant cortege. At the head
rode a regiment of red-coated hussars&mdash;enormous men, black as
night. There were troops of riflemen mounted on camels. The emperor
rode in a golden howdah upon the back of a huge elephant so covered
with rich hangings and embellished with scintillating gems that
scarce more than the beast's eyes and feet were visible.</p>

<p>Menelek was a rather gross-looking man, well past middle age,
but he carried himself with an air of dignity befitting one
descended in unbroken line from the Prophet&mdash;as was his
claim.</p>

<p>His eyes were bright but crafty, and his features denoted both
sensuality and cruelness. In his youth he may have been a rather
fine looking black, but when I saw him his appearance was
revolting&mdash;to me, at least.</p>

<p>Following the emperor came regiment after regiment from the
various branches of the service, among them batteries of field guns
mounted on elephants.</p>

<p>In the center of the troops following the imperial elephant
marched a great caravan of slaves. The old street sweeper at my
elbow told me that these were the gifts brought in from the far
outlying districts by the commanding officers of the frontier
posts. The majority of them were women, destined, I was told, for
the harems of the emperor and his favorites. It made my old
companion clench his fists to see those poor white women marching
past to their horrid fates, and, though I shared his sentiments, I
was as powerless to alter their destinies as he.</p>

<p>For a week the troops kept pouring in and out of New
Gondar&mdash;in, always, from the south and west, but always toward
the east. Each new contingent brought its gifts to the emperor.
From the south they brought rugs and ornaments and jewels; from the
west, slaves; for the commanding officers of the western frontier
posts had naught else to bring.</p>

<p>From the number of women they brought, I judged that they knew
the weakness of their imperial master.</p>

<p>And then soldiers commenced coming in from the east, but not
with the gay assurance of those who came from the south and
west&mdash;no, these others came in covered wagons, blood-soaked
and suffering. They came at first in little parties of eight or
ten, and then they came in fifties, in hundreds, and one day a
thousand maimed and dying men were carted into New Gondar.</p>

<p>It was then that Menelek XIV became uneasy. For fifty years his
armies had conquered wherever they had marched. At first he had led
them in person, lately his presence within a hundred miles of the
battle line had been sufficient for large engagements&mdash;for
minor ones only the knowledge that they were fighting for the glory
of their sovereign was necessary to win victories.</p>

<p>One morning, New Gondar was awakened by the booming of cannon.
It was the first intimation that the townspeople had received that
the enemy was forcing the imperial troops back upon the city. Dust
covered couriers galloped in from the front. Fresh troops hastened
from the city, and about noon Menelek rode out surrounded by his
staff.</p>

<p>For three days thereafter we could hear the cannonading and the
spitting of the small arms, for the battle line was scarce two
leagues from New Gondar. The city was filled with wounded. Just
outside, soldiers were engaged in throwing up earthworks. It was
evident to the least enlightened that Menelek expected further
reverses.</p>

<p>And then the imperial troops fell back upon these new defenses,
or, rather, they were forced back by the enemy. Shells commenced to
fall within the city. Menelek returned and took up his headquarters
in the stone building that was called the palace. That night came a
lull in the hostilities&mdash;a truce had been arranged.</p>

<p>Colonel Belik summoned me about seven o'clock to dress him for a
function at the palace. In the midst of death and defeat the
emperor was about to give a great banquet to his officers. I was to
accompany my master and wait upon him&mdash;I, Jefferson Turck,
lieutenant in the Pan-American navy!</p>

<p>In the privacy of the colonel's quarters I had become accustomed
to my menial duties, lightened as they were by the natural
kindliness of my master, but the thought of appearing in public as
a common slave revolted every fine instinct within me. Yet there
was nothing for it but to obey.</p>

<p>I cannot, even now, bring myself to a narration of the
humiliation which I experienced that night as I stood behind my
black master in silent servility, now pouring his wine, now cutting
up his meats for him, now fanning him with a large, plumed fan of
feathers.</p>

<p>As fond as I had grown of him, I could have thrust a knife into
him, so keenly did I feel the affront that had been put upon me.
But at last the long banquet was concluded. The tables were
removed. The emperor ascended a dais at one end of the room and
seated himself upon a throne, and the entertainment commenced. It
was only what ancient history might have led me to
expect&mdash;musicians, dancing girls, jugglers, and the like.</p>

<p>Near midnight, the master of ceremonies announced that the slave
women who had been presented to the emperor since his arrival in
New Gondar would be exhibited, that the royal host would select
such as he wished, after which he would present the balance of them
to his guests. Ah, what royal generosity!</p>

<p>A small door at one side of the room opened, and the poor
creatures filed in and were ranged in a long line before the
throne. Their backs were toward me. I saw only an occasional
profile as now and then a bolder spirit among them turned to survey
the apartment and the gorgeous assemblage of officers in their
brilliant dress uniforms. They were profiles of young girls, and
pretty, but horror was indelibly stamped upon them all. I shuddered
as I contemplated their sad fate, and turned my eyes away.</p>

<p>I heard the master of ceremonies command them to prostrate
themselves before the emperor, and the sounds as they went upon
their knees before him, touching their foreheads to the floor. Then
came the official's voice again, in sharp and peremptory
command.</p>

<p>"Down, slave!" he cried. "Make obeisance to your sovereign!"</p>

<p>I looked up, attracted by the tone of the man's voice, to see a
single, straight, slim figure standing erect in the center of the
line of prostrate girls, her arms folded across her breast and
little chin in the air. Her back was toward me&mdash;I could not
see her face, though I should like to see the countenance of this
savage young lioness, standing there defiant among that herd of
terrified sheep.</p>

<p>"Down! Down!" shouted the master of ceremonies, taking a step
toward her and half drawing his sword.</p>

<p>My blood boiled. To stand there, inactive, while a negro struck
down that brave girl of my own race! Instinctively I took a forward
step to place myself in the man's path. But at the same instant
Menelek raised his hand in a gesture that halted the officer. The
emperor seemed interested, but in no way angered at the girl's
attitude.</p>

<p>"Let us inquire," he said in a smooth, pleasant voice, "why this
young woman refuses to do homage to her sovereign," and he put the
question himself directly to her.</p>

<p>She answered him in Abyssinian, but brokenly and with an accent
that betrayed how recently she had acquired her slight knowledge of
the tongue.</p>

<p>"I go on my knees to no one," she said. "I have no sovereign. I
myself am sovereign in my own country."</p>

<p>Menelek, at her words, leaned back in his throne and laughed
uproariously. Following his example, which seemed always the
correct procedure, the assembled guests vied with one another in an
effort to laugh more noisily than the emperor.</p>

<p>The girl but tilted her chin a bit higher in the air&mdash;even
her back proclaimed her utter contempt for her captors. Finally
Menelek restored quiet by the simple expedient of a frown,
whereupon each loyal guest exchanged his mirthful mien for an
emulative scowl.</p>

<p>"And who," asked Menelek, "are you, and by what name is your
country called?"</p>

<p>"I am Victory, Queen of Grabritin," replied the girl so quickly
and so unexpectedly that I gasped in astonishment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">VICTORY! She was here, a slave to these black
conquerors. Once more I started toward her, but better judgment
held me back&mdash;I could do nothing to help her other than by
stealth. Could I even accomplish aught by this means? I did not
know. It seemed beyond the pale of possibility, and yet I should
try.</p>

<p>"And you will not bend the knee to me?" continued Menelek, after
she had spoken. Victory shook her head in a most decided
negation.</p>

<p>"You shall be my first choice, then," said the emperor. "I like
your spirit, for the breaking of it will add to my pleasure in you,
and never fear but that it shall be broken&mdash;this very night.
Take her to my apartments," and he motioned to an officer at his
side.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see Victory follow the man off in apparent
quiet submission. I tried to follow, that I might be near her
against some opportunity to speak with her or assist in her escape.
But, after I had followed them from the throne room, through
several other apartments, and down a long corridor, I found my
further progress barred by a soldier who stood guard before a
doorway through which the officer conducted Victory.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the officer reappeared and started back in
the direction of the throne room. I had been hiding in a doorway
after the guard had turned me back, having taken refuge there while
his back was turned, and, as the officer approached me, I withdrew
into the room beyond, which was in darkness. There I remained for a
long time, watching the sentry before the door of the room in which
Victory was a prisoner, and awaiting some favorable circumstance
which would give me entry to her.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to fully describe my sensations at the
moment I recognized Victory, because, I can assure you, they were
entirely indescribable. I should never have imagined that the sight
of any human being could affect me as had this unexpected discovery
of Victory in the same room in which I was, while I had thought of
her for weeks either as dead, or at best hundreds of miles to the
west, and as irretrievably lost to me as though she were, in truth,
dead.</p>

<p>I was filled with a strange, mad impulse to be near her. It was
not enough merely to assist her, or protect her&mdash;I desired to
touch her&mdash;to take her in my arms. I was astounded at myself.
Another thing puzzled me&mdash;it was my incomprehensible feeling
of elation since I had again seen her. With a fate worse than death
staring her in the face, and with the knowledge that I should
probably die defending her within the hour, I was still happier
than I had been for weeks&mdash;and all because I had seen again
for a few brief minutes the figure of a little heathen maiden. I
couldn't account for it, and it angered me; I had never before felt
any such sensations in the presence of a woman, and I had made love
to some very beautiful ones in my time.</p>

<p>It seemed ages that I stood in the shadow of that doorway, in
the ill-lit corridor of the palace of Menelek XIV. A sickly gas jet
cast a sad pallor upon the black face of the sentry. The fellow
seemed rooted to the spot. Evidently he would never leave, or turn
his back again.</p>

<p>I had been in hiding but a short time when I heard the sound of
distant cannon. The truce had ended, and the battle had been
resumed. Very shortly thereafter the earth shook to the explosion
of a shell within the city, and from time to time thereafter other
shells burst at no great distance from the palace. The yellow men
were bombarding New Gondar again.</p>

<p>Presently officers and slaves commenced to traverse the corridor
on matters pertaining to their duties, and then came the emperor,
scowling and wrathful. He was followed by a few personal
attendants, whom he dismissed at the doorway to his
apartments&mdash;the same doorway through which Victory had been
taken. I chafed to follow him, but the corridor was filled with
people. At last they betook themselves to their own apartments,
which lay upon either side of the corridor.</p>

<p>An officer and a slave entered the very room in which I hid,
forcing me to flatten myself to one side in the darkness until they
had passed. Then the slave made a light, and I knew that I must
find another hiding place.</p>

<p>Stepping boldly into the corridor, I saw that it was now empty
save for the single sentry before the emperor's door. He glanced up
as I emerged from the room, the occupants of which had not seen me.
I walked straight toward the soldier, my mind made up in an
instant. I tried to simulate an expression of cringing servility,
and I must have succeeded, for I entirely threw the man off his
guard, so that he permitted me to approach within reach of his
rifle before stopping me. Then it was too late&mdash;for him.</p>

<p>Without a word or a warning, I snatched the piece from his
grasp, and, at the same time struck him a terrific blow between the
eyes with my clenched fist. He staggered back in surprise, too
dumbfounded even to cry out, and then I clubbed his rifle and
felled him with a single mighty blow.</p>

<p>A moment later, I had burst into the room beyond. It was
empty!</p>

<p>I gazed about, mad with disappointment. Two doors opened from
this to other rooms. I ran to the nearer and listened. Yes, voices
were coming from beyond and one was a woman's, level and cold and
filled with scorn. There was no terror in it. It was Victory's.</p>

<p>I turned the knob and pushed the door inward just in time to see
Menelek seize the girl and drag her toward the far end of the
apartment. At the same instant there was a deafening roar just
outside the palace&mdash;a shell had struck much nearer than any of
its predecessors. The noise of it drowned my rapid rush across the
room.</p>

<p>But in her struggles, Victory turned Menelek about so that he
saw me. She was striking him in the face with her clenched fist,
and now he was choking her.</p>

<p>At sight of me, he gave voice to a roar of anger.</p>

<p>"What means this, slave?" he cried. "Out of here! Out of here!
Quick, before I kill you!"</p>

<p>But for answer I rushed upon him, striking him with the butt of
the rifle. He staggered back, dropping Victory to the floor, and
then he cried aloud for the guard, and came at me. Again and again
I struck him; but his thick skull might have been armor plate, for
all the damage I did it.</p>

<p>He tried to close with me, seizing the rifle, but I was stronger
than he, and, wrenching the weapon from his grasp, tossed it aside
and made for his throat with my bare hands. I had not dared fire
the weapon for fear that its report would bring the larger guard
stationed at the farther end of the corridor.</p>

<p>We struggled about the room, striking one another, knocking over
furniture, and rolling upon the floor. Menelek was a powerful man,
and he was fighting for his life. Continually he kept calling for
the guard, until I succeeded in getting a grip upon his throat; but
it was too late. His cries had been heard, and suddenly the door
burst open, and a score of armed guardsmen rushed into the
apartment.</p>

<p>Victory seized the rifle from the floor and leaped between me
and them. I had the black emperor upon his back, and both my hands
were at his throat, choking the life from him.</p>

<p>The rest happened in the fraction of a second. There was a
rending crash above us, then a deafening explosion within the
chamber. Smoke and powder fumes filled the room. Half stunned, I
rose from the lifeless body of my antagonist just in time to see
Victory stagger to her feet and turn toward me. Slowly the smoke
cleared to reveal the shattered remnants of the guard. A shell had
fallen through the palace roof and exploded just in the rear of the
detachment of guardsmen who were coming to the rescue of their
emperor. Why neither Victory nor I were struck is a miracle. The
room was a wreck. A great, jagged hole was torn in the ceiling, and
the wall toward the corridor had been blown entirely out.</p>

<p>As I rose, Victory had risen, too, and started toward me. But
when she saw that I was uninjured she stopped, and stood there in
the center of the demolished apartment looking at me. Her
expression was inscrutable&mdash;I could not guess whether she was
glad to see me, or not.</p>

<p>"Victory!" I cried. "Thank God that you are safe!" And I
approached her, a greater gladness in my heart than I had felt
since the moment that I knew the <i>Coldwater</i> must be swept
beyond thirty.</p>

<p>There was no answering gladness in her eyes. Instead, she
stamped her little foot in anger.</p>

<p>"Why did it have to be you who saved me!" she exclaimed. "I hate
you!"</p>

<p>"Hate me?" I asked. "Why should you hate me, Victory? I do not
hate you. I&mdash;I&mdash;" What was I about to say? I was very
close to her as a great light broke over me. Why had I never
realized it before? The truth accounted for a great many hitherto
inexplicable moods that had claimed me from time to time since
first I had seen Victory.</p>

<p>"Why should I hate you?" she repeated. "Because Snider told
me&mdash;he told me that you had promised me to him, but he did not
get me. I killed him, as I should like to kill you!"</p>

<p>"Snider lied!" I cried. And then I seized her and held her in my
arms, and made her listen to me, though she struggled and fought
like a young lioness. "I love you, Victory. You must know that I
love you&mdash;that I have always loved you, and that I never could
have made so base a promise."</p>

<p>She ceased her struggles, just a trifle, but still tried to push
me from her. "You called me a barbarian!" she said.</p>

<p>Ah, so that was it! That still rankled. I crushed her to me.</p>

<p>"You could not love a barbarian," she went on, but she had
ceased to struggle.</p>

<p>"But I do love a barbarian, Victory!" I cried, "the dearest
barbarian in the world."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to mine, and then her smooth, brown arms
encircled my neck and drew my lips down to hers.</p>

<p>"I love you&mdash;I have loved you always!" she said, and then
she buried her face upon my shoulder and sobbed. "I have been so
unhappy," she said, "but I could not die while I thought that you
might live."</p>

<p>As we stood there, momentarily forgetful of all else than our
new found happiness, the ferocity of the bombardment increased
until scarce thirty seconds elapsed between the shells that rained
about the palace.</p>

<p>To remain long would be to invite certain death. We could not
escape the way that we had entered the apartment, for not only was
the corridor now choked with debris, but beyond the corridor there
were doubtless many members of the emperor's household who would
stop us.</p>

<p>Upon the opposite side of the room was another door, and toward
this I led the way. It opened into a third apartment with windows
overlooking an inner court. From one of these windows I surveyed
the courtyard. Apparently it was empty, and the rooms upon the
opposite side were unlighted.</p>

<p>Assisting Victory to the open, I followed, and together we
crossed the court, discovering upon the opposite side a number of
wide, wooden doors set in the wall of the palace, with small
windows between. As we stood close behind one of the doors,
listening, a horse within neighed.</p>

<p>"The stables!" I whispered, and, a moment later, had pushed back
a door and entered. From the city about us we could hear the din of
great commotion, and quite close the sounds of battle&mdash;the
crack of thousands of rifles, the yells of the soldiers, the hoarse
commands of officers, and the blare of bugles.</p>

<p>The bombardment had ceased as suddenly as it had commenced. I
judged that the enemy was storming the city, for the sounds we
heard were the sounds of hand-to-hand combat.</p>

<p>Within the stables I groped about until I had found saddles and
bridles for two horses. But afterward, in the darkness, I could
find but a single mount. The doors of the opposite side, leading to
the street, were open, and we could see great multitudes of men,
women, and children fleeing toward the west. Soldiers, afoot and
mounted, were joining the mad exodus. Now and then a camel or an
elephant would pass bearing some officer or dignitary to safety. It
was evident that the city would fall at any moment&mdash;a fact
which was amply proclaimed by the terror-stricken haste of the
fear-mad mob.</p>

<p>Horse, camel, and elephant trod helpless women and children
beneath their feet. A common soldier dragged a general from his
mount, and, leaping to the animal's back, fled down the packed
street toward the west. A woman seized a gun and brained a court
dignitary, whose horse had trampled her child to death. Shrieks,
curses, commands, supplications filled the air. It was a frightful
scene&mdash;one that will be burned upon my memory forever.</p>

<p>I had saddled and bridled the single horse which had evidently
been overlooked by the royal household in its flight, and, standing
a little back in the shadow of the stable's interior, Victory and I
watched the surging throng without.</p>

<p>To have entered it would have been to have courted greater
danger than we were already in. We decided to wait until the stress
of blacks thinned, and for more than an hour we stood there while
the sounds of battle raged upon the eastern side of the city and
the population flew toward the west. More and more numerous became
the uniformed soldiers among the fleeing throng, until, toward the
last, the street was packed with them. It was no orderly retreat,
but a rout, complete and terrible.</p>

<p>The fighting was steadily approaching us now, until the crack of
rifles sounded in the very street upon which we were looking. And
then came a handful of brave men&mdash;a little rear guard backing
slowly toward the west, working their smoking rifles in feverish
haste as they fired volley after volley at the foe we could not
see.</p>

<p>But these were pressed back and back until the first line of the
enemy came opposite our shelter. They were men of medium height,
with olive complexions and almond eyes. In them I recognized the
descendants of the ancient Chinese race.</p>

<p>They were well uniformed and superbly armed, and they fought
bravely and under perfect discipline. So rapt was I in the exciting
events transpiring in the street that I did not hear the approach
of a body of men from behind. It was a party of the conquerors who
had entered the palace and were searching it.</p>

<p>They came upon us so unexpectedly that we were prisoners before
we realized what had happened. That night we were held under a
strong guard just outside the eastern wall of the city, and the
next morning were started upon a long march toward the east.</p>

<p>Our captors were not unkind to us, and treated the women
prisoners with respect. We marched for many days&mdash;so many that
I lost count of them&mdash;and at last we came to another
city&mdash;a Chinese city this time&mdash;which stands upon the
site of ancient Moscow.</p>

<p>It is only a small frontier city, but it is well built and well
kept. Here a large military force is maintained, and here also, is
a terminus of the railroad that crosses modern China to the
Pacific.</p>

<p>There was every evidence of a high civilization in all that we
saw within the city, which, in connection with the humane treatment
that had been accorded all prisoners upon the long and tiresome
march, encouraged me to hope that I might appeal to some high
officer here for the treatment which my rank and birth merited.</p>

<p>We could converse with our captors only through the medium of
interpreters who spoke both Chinese and Abyssinian. But there were
many of these, and shortly after we reached the city I persuaded
one of them to carry a verbal message to the officer who had
commanded the troops during the return from New Gondar, asking that
I might be given a hearing by some high official.</p>

<p>The reply to my request was a summons to appear before the
officer to whom I had addressed my appeal. A sergeant came for me
along with the interpreter, and I managed to obtain his permission
to let Victory accompany me&mdash;I had never left her alone with
the prisoners since we had been captured.</p>

<p>To my delight I found that the officer into whose presence we
were conducted spoke Abyssinian fluently. He was astounded when I
told him that I was a Pan-American. Unlike all others whom I had
spoken with since my arrival in Europe, he was well acquainted with
ancient history&mdash;was familiar with twentieth century
conditions in Pan-America, and after putting a half dozen questions
to me was satisfied that I spoke the truth.</p>

<p>When I told him that Victory was Queen of England he showed
little surprise, telling me that in their recent explorations in
ancient Russia they had found many descendants of the old nobility
and royalty.</p>

<p>He immediately set aside a comfortable house for us, furnished
us with servants and with money, and in other ways showed us every
attention and kindness.</p>

<p>He told me that he would telegraph his emperor at once, and the
result was that we were presently commanded to repair to Peking and
present ourselves before the ruler.</p>

<p>We made the journey in a comfortable railway carriage, through a
country which, as we traveled farther toward the east, showed
increasing evidence of prosperity and wealth.</p>

<p>At the imperial court we were received with great kindness, the
emperor being most inquisitive about the state of modern
Pan-America. He told me that while he personally deplored the
existence of the strict regulations which had raised a barrier
between the east and the west, he had felt, as had his
predecessors, that recognition of the wishes of the great
Pan-American federation would be most conducive to the continued
peace of the world.</p>

<p>His empire includes all of Asia, and the islands of the Pacific
as far east as 175�W. The empire of Japan no longer exists, having
been conquered and absorbed by China over a hundred years ago. The
Philippines are well administered, and constitute one of the most
progressive colonies of the Chinese empire.</p>

<p>The emperor told me that the building of this great empire and
the spreading of enlightenment among its diversified and savage
peoples had required all the best efforts of nearly two hundred
years. Upon his accession to the throne he had found the labor well
nigh perfected and had turned his attention to the reclamation of
Europe.</p>

<p>His ambition is to wrest it from the hands of the blacks, and
then to attempt the work of elevating its fallen peoples to the
high estate from which the Great War precipitated them.</p>

<p>I asked him who was victorious in that war, and he shook his
head sadly as he replied:</p>

<p>"Pan-America, perhaps, and China, with the blacks of Abyssinia,"
he said. "Those who did not fight were the only ones to reap any of
the rewards that are supposed to belong to victory. The combatants
reaped naught but annihilation. You have seen&mdash;better than any
man you must realize that there was no victory for any nation
embroiled in that frightful war."</p>

<p>"When did it end?" I asked him.</p>

<p>Again he shook his head. "It has not ended yet. There has never
been a formal peace declared in Europe. After a while there were
none left to make peace, and the rude tribes which sprang from the
survivors continued to fight among themselves because they knew no
better condition of society. War razed the works of man&mdash;war
and pestilence razed man. God give that there shall never be such
another war!"</p>

<p>You all know how Porfirio Johnson returned to Pan-America with
John Alvarez in chains; how Alvarez's trial raised a popular
demonstration that the government could not ignore. His eloquent
appeal&mdash;not for himself, but for me&mdash;is historic, as are
its results. You know how a fleet was sent across the Atlantic to
search for me, how the restrictions against crossing thirty to one
hundred seventy-five were removed forever, and how the officers
were brought to Peking, arriving upon the very day that Victory and
I were married at the imperial court.</p>

<p>My return to Pan-America was very different from anything I
could possibly have imagined a year before. Instead of being
received as a traitor to my country, I was acclaimed a hero. It was
good to get back again, good to witness the kindly treatment that
was accorded my dear Victory, and when I learned that Delcarte and
Taylor had been found at the mouth of the Rhine and were already
back in Pan-America my joy was unalloyed.</p>

<p>And now we are going back, Victory and I, with the men and the
munitions and power to reclaim England for her queen. Again I shall
cross thirty, but under what altered conditions!</p>

<p>A new epoch for Europe is inaugurated, with enlightened China on
the east and enlightened Pan-America on the west&mdash;the two
great peace powers whom God has preserved to regenerate chastened
and forgiven Europe. I have been through much&mdash;I have suffered
much, but I have won two great laurel wreaths beyond thirty. One is
the opportunity to rescue Europe from barbarism, the other is a
little barbarian, and the greater of these is&mdash;Victory.</p>
