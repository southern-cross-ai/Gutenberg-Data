<p class="first">ACROSS the red drifts and mail-clad forms, two
figures glared at each other. In that utter desolation only they
moved. The frosty sky was over them, the white illimitable plain
around them, the dead men at their feet. Slowly through the
corpses they came, as ghosts might come to a tryst through the
shambles of a dead world. In the brooding silence they stood face
to face.</p>

<p>Both were tall men, built like tigers. Their shields were
gone, their corselets battered and dinted. Blood dried on their
mail; their swords were stained red. Their horned helmets showed
the marks of fierce strokes. One was beardless and black-maned.
The locks and beard of the other were red as the blood on the
sunlit snow.</p>

<p>"Man," said he, "tell me your name, so that my brothers in
Vanaheim may know who was the last of Wulfhere's band to fall
before the sword of Heimdul."</p>

<p>"Not in Vanaheim," growled the black-haired warrior, "but in
Valhalla will you tell your brothers that you met Conan of
Cimmeria."</p>

<p>Heimdul roared and leaped, and his sword flashed in deathly
arc. Conan staggered and his vision was filled with red sparks as
the singing blade crashed on his helmet, shivering into bits of
blue fire. But as he reeled he thrust with all the power of his
broad shoulders behind the humming blade. The sharp point tore
through brass scales and bones and heart, and the red-haired
warrior died at Conan's feet.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian stood upright, trailing his sword, a sudden sick
weariness assailing him. The glare of the sun on the snow cut his
eyes like a knife and the sky seemed shrunken and strangely
apart. He turned away from the trampled expanse where yellow-bearded warriors lay locked with red-haired slayers in the
embrace of death. A few steps he took, and the glare of the snow
fields was suddenly dimmed. A rushing wave of blindness engulfed
him and he sank down into the snow, supporting himself on one
mailed arm, seeking to shake the blindness out of his eyes as a
lion might shake his mane.</p>

<p>A silvery laugh cut through his dizziness, and his sight
cleared slowly. He looked up; there was a strangeness about all
the landscape that he could not place or define&mdash;an
unfamiliar tinge to earth and sky. But he did not think long of
this. Before him, swaying like a sapling in the wind, stood a
woman. Her body was like ivory to his dazed gaze, and save for a
light veil of gossamer, she was naked as the day. Her slender
bare feet were whiter than the snow they spurned. She laughed
down at the bewildered warrior. Her laughter was sweeter than the
rippling of silvery fountains, and poisonous with cruel
mockery.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Cimmerian. "Whence come you?"</p>

<p>"What matter?" Her voice was more musical than a silver-stringed harp, but it was edged with cruelty.</p>

<p>"Call up your men," said he, grasping his sword. "Yet though
my strength fail me, they shall not take me alive. I see that you
are of the Vanir."</p>

<p>"Have I said so?"</p>

<p>His gaze went again to her unruly locks, which at first glance
he had thought to be red. Now he saw that they were neither red
nor yellow but a glorious compound of both colors. He gazed
spell-bound. Her hair was like elfin-gold; the sun struck it so
dazzlingly that he could scarcely bear to look upon it. Her eyes
were likewise neither wholly blue nor wholly grey, but of
shifting colors and dancing lights and clouds of colors he could
not define. Her full red lips smiled, and from her slender feet
to the blinding crown of her billowy hair, her ivory body was as
perfect as the dream of a god. Conan's pulse hammered in his
temples.</p>

<p>"I can not tell," said he, "whether you are of Vanaheim and
mine enemy, or of Asgard and my friend. Far have I wandered, but
a woman like you I have never seen. Your locks blind me with
their brightness. Never have I seen such hair, not even among the
fairest daughters of the Aesir. By Ymir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are you to swear by Ymir?" she mocked. "What know you of
the gods of ice and snow, you who have come up from the south to
adventure among an alien people?"</p>

<p>"By the dark gods of my own race!" he cried in anger. "Though
I am not of the golden-haired Aesir, none has been more forward
in sword-play! This day I have seen four score men fall, and I
alone have survived the field where Wulfhere's reavers met the
wolves of Bragi. Tell me, woman, have you seen the flash of mail
out across the snow-plains, or seen armed men moving upon the
ice?"</p>

<p>"I have seen the hoar-frost glittering in the sun," she
answered. "I have heard the wind whispering across the
everlasting snows."</p>

<p>He shook his head with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Niord should have come up with us before the battle joined. I
fear he and his fighting-men have been ambushed. Wulfhere and his
warriors lie dead.</p>

<p>"I had thought there was no village within many leagues of
this spot, for the war carried us far, but you can not have come
a great distance over these snows, naked as you are. Lead me to
your tribe, if you are of Asgard, for I am faint with blows and
the weariness of strife."</p>

<p>"My village is further than you can walk, Conan of Cimmeria,"
she laughed. Spreading her arms wide, she swayed before him, her
golden head lolling sensuously, her scintillant eyes half
shadowed beneath their long silken lashes. "Am I not beautiful,
oh man?"</p>

<p>"Like Dawn running naked on the snows," he muttered, his eyes
burning like those of a wolf.</p>

<p>"Then why do you not rise and follow me? Who is the strong
warrior who falls down before me?" she chanted in maddening
mockery. "Lie down and die in the snow with the other fools,
Conan of the black hair. You can not follow where I would
lead."</p>

<p>With an oath the Cimmerian heaved himself up on his feet, his
blue eyes blazing, his dark scarred face contorted. Rage shook
his soul, but desire for the taunting figure before him hammered
at his temples and drove his wild blood fiercely through his
veins. Passion fierce as physical agony flooded his whole being,
so that earth and sky swam red to his dizzy gaze. In the madness
that swept upon him, weariness and faintness were swept away.</p>

<p>He spoke no word as he drove at her, fingers spread to grip
her soft flesh. With a shriek of laughter she leaped back and
ran, laughing at him over her white shoulder. With a low growl
Conan followed. He had forgotten the fight, forgotten the mailed
warriors who lay in their blood, forgotten Niord and the reavers
who had failed to reach the fight. He had thought only for the
slender white shape which seemed to float rather than run before
him.</p>

<p>Out across the white blinding plain the chase led. The
trampled red field fell out of sight behind him, but still Conan
kept on with the silent tenacity of his race. His mailed feet
broke through the frozen crust; he sank deep in the drifts and
forged through them by sheer strength. But the girl danced across
the snow light as a feather floating across a pool; her naked
feet barely left their imprint on the hoar-frost that overlaid
the crust. In spite of the fire in his veins, the cold bit
through warrior's mail and fur-lined tunic; but the girl in her
gossamer veil ran as lightly and as gaily as if she danced
through the palm and rose gardens of Poitain.</p>

<p>On and on she led, and Conan followed. Black curses drooled
through the Cimmerian's parched lips. The great veins in his
temples swelled and throbbed and his teeth gnashed.</p>

<p>"You can not escape me!" he roared. "Lead me into a trap and
I'll pile the heads of your kinsmen at your feet! Hide from me
and I'll tear apart the mountains to find you! I'll follow you to
hell!"</p>

<p>Her maddening laughter floated back to him, and foam flew from
the barbarian's lips. Further and further into the wastes she led
him. The land changed; the wide plains gave way to low hills,
marching upward in broken ranges. Far to the north he caught a
glimpse of towering mountains, blue with the distance, or white
with the eternal snows. Above these mountains shone the flaring
rays of the borealis. They spread fan-wise into the sky, frosty
blades of cold flaming light, changing in color, growing and
brightening.</p>

<p>Above him the skies glowed and crackled with strange lights
and gleams. The snow shone weirdly, now frosty blue, now icy
crimson, now cold silver. Through a shimmering icy realm of
enchantment Conan plunged doggedly onward, in a crystalline maze
where the only reality was the white body dancing across the
glittering snow beyond his reach&mdash;ever beyond his reach.</p>

<p>He did not wonder at the strangeness of it all, not even when
two gigantic figures rose up to bar his way. The scales of their
mail were white with hoar-frost; their helmets and their axes
were covered with ice. Snow sprinkled their locks; in their
beards were spikes of icicles; their eyes were cold as the lights
that streamed above them.</p>

<p>"Brothers!" cried the girl, dancing between them. "Look who
follows! I have brought you a man to slay! Take his heart that we
may lay it smoking on our father's board!"</p>

<p>The giants answered with roars like the grinding of ice-bergs
on a frozen shore and heaved up their shining axes as the
maddened Cimmerian hurled himself upon them. A frosty blade
flashed before his eyes, blinding him with its brightness, and he
gave back a terrible stroke that sheared through his foe's thigh.
With a groan the victim fell, and at the instant Conan was dashed
into the snow, his left shoulder numb from the blow of the
survivor, from which the Cimmerian's mail had barely saved his
life. Conan saw the remaining giant looming high above him like a
colossus carved of ice, etched against the cold glowing sky. The
axe fell, to sink through the snow and deep into the frozen earth
as Conan hurled himself aside and leaped to his feet. The giant
roared and wrenched his axe free, but even as he did, Conan's
sword sang down. The giant's knees bent and he sank slowly into
the snow, which turned crimson with the blood that gushed from
his half-severed neck.</p>

<p>Conan wheeled, to see the girl standing a short distance away,
staring at him in wide-eyed horror, all the mockery gone from her
face. He cried out fiercely and the blood-drops flew from his
sword as his hand shook in the intensity of his passion.</p>

<p>"Call the rest of your brothers!" he cried. "I'll give their
hearts to the wolves! You can not escape me&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a cry of fright she turned and ran fleetly. She did not
laugh now, nor mock him over her white shoulder. She ran as for
her life, and though he strained every nerve and thew, until his
temples were like to burst and the snow swam red to his gaze, she
drew away from him, dwindling in the witch-fire of the skies,
until she was a figure no bigger than a child, then a dancing
white flame on the snow, then a dim blur in the distance. But
grinding his teeth until the blood started from his gums, he
reeled on, and he saw the blur grow to a dancing white flame, and
the flame to a figure big as a child; and then she was running
less than a hundred paces ahead of him, and slowly the space
narrowed, foot by foot.</p>

<p>She was running with effort now, her golden locks blowing
free; he heard the quick panting of her breath, and saw a flash
of fear in the look she cast over her white shoulder. The grim
endurance of the barbarian had served him well. The speed ebbed
from her flashing white legs; she reeled in her gait. In his
untamed soul leaped up the fires of hell she had fanned so well.
With an inhuman roar he closed in on her, just as she wheeled
with a haunting cry and flung out her arms to fend him off.</p>

<p>His sword fell into the snow as he crushed her to him. Her
lithe body bent backward as she fought with desperate frenzy in
his iron arms. Her golden hair blew about his face, blinding him
with its sheen; the feel of her slender body twisting in his
mailed arms drove him to blinder madness. His strong fingers sank
deep into her smooth flesh; and that flesh was cold as ice. It
was as if he embraced not a woman of human flesh and blood, but a
woman of flaming ice. She writhed her golden head aside, striving
to avoid the fierce kisses that bruised her red lips.</p>

<p>"You are cold as the snows," he mumbled dazedly. "I will warm
you with the fire in my own blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a scream and a desperate wrench she slipped from his
arms, leaving her single gossamer garment in his grasp. She
sprang back and faced him, her golden locks in wild disarray, her
white bosom heaving, her beautiful eyes blazing with terror. For
an instant he stood frozen, awed by her terrible beauty as she
posed naked against the snows.</p>

<p>And in that instant she flung her arms toward the lights that
glowed in the skies above her and cried out in a voice that rang
in Conan's ears for ever after: "Ymir! Oh, my father, save
me!"</p>

<p>Conan was leaping forward, arms spread to seize her, when with
a crack like the breaking of an ice mountain, the whole skies
leaped into icy fire. The girl's ivory body was suddenly
enveloped in a cold blue flame so blinding that the Cimmerian
threw up his hands to shield his eyes from the intolerable blaze.
A fleeting instant, skies and snowy hills were bathed in
crackling white flames, blue darts of icy light, and frozen
crimson fires. Then Conan staggered and cried out. The girl was
gone. The glowing snow lay empty and bare; high above his head
the witch-lights flashed and played in a frosty sky gone mad, and
among the distant blue mountains there sounded a rolling thunder
as of a gigantic war-chariot rushing behind steeds whose frantic
hoofs struck lightning from the snows and echoes from the
skies.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the borealis, the snow-clad hills and the
blazing heavens reeled drunkenly to Conan's sight; thousands of
fire-balls burst with showers of sparks, and the sky itself
became a titanic wheel which rained stars as it spun. Under his
feet the snowy hills heaved up like a wave, and the Cimmerian
crumpled into the snows to lie motionless.</p>

<p>In a cold dark universe, whose sun was extinguished eons ago,
Conan felt the movement of life, alien and unguessed. An
earthquake had him in its grip and was shaking him to and fro, at
the same time chafing his hands and feet until he yelled in pain
and fury and groped for his sword.</p>

<p>"He's coming to, Horsa," said a voice. "Haste&mdash;we must
rub the frost out of his limbs, if he's ever to wield sword
again."</p>

<p>"He won't open his left hand," growled another. "He's
clutching something&mdash;"</p>

<p>Conan opened his eyes and stared into the bearded faces that
bent over him. He was surrounded by tall golden-haired warriors
in mail and furs.</p>

<p>"Conan! You live!"</p>

<p>"By Crom, Niord," gasped the Cimmerian. "Am I alive, or are we
all dead and in Valhalla?"</p>

<p>"We live," grunted the Aesir, busy over Conan's half-frozen
feet. "We had to fight our way through an ambush, or we had come
up with you before the battle was joined. The corpses were scarce
cold when we came upon the field. We did not find you among the
dead, so we followed your spoor. In Ymir's name, Conan, why did
you wander off into the wastes of the north? We have followed
your tracks in the snow for hours. Had a blizzard come up and
hidden them, we had never found you, by Ymir!"</p>

<p>"Swear not so often by Ymir," uneasily muttered a warrior,
glancing at the distant mountains. "This is his land and the god
bides among yonder mountains, the legends say."</p>

<p>"I saw a woman," Conan answered hazily. "We met Bragi's men in
the plains. I know not how long we fought. I alone lived. I was
dizzy and faint. The land lay like a dream before me. Only now do
all things seem natural and familiar. The woman came and taunted
me. She was beautiful as a frozen flame from hell. A strange
madness fell upon me when I looked at her, so I forgot all else
in the world. I followed her. Did you not find her tracks? Or the
giants in icy mail I slew?"</p>

<p>Niord shook his head.</p>

<p>"We found only your tracks in the snow, Conan."</p>

<p>"Then it may be I am mad," said Conan dazedly. "Yet you
yourself are no more real to me than was the golden-locked witch
who fled naked across the snows before me. Yet from under my very
hands she vanished in icy flame."</p>

<p>"He is delirious," whispered a warrior.</p>

<p>"Not so!" cried an older man, whose eyes were wild and weird.
"It was Atali, the daughter of Ymir, the frost-giant! To fields
of the dead she comes, and shows herself to the dying! Myself
when a boy I saw her, when I lay half-slain on the bloody field
of Wolraven. I saw her walk among the dead in the snows, her
naked body gleaming like ivory and her golden hair unbearably
bright in the moonlight. I lay and howled like a dying dog
because I could not crawl after her. She lures men from stricken
fields into the wastelands to be slain by her brothers, the ice-giants, who lay men's red hearts smoking on Ymir's board. The
Cimmerian has seen Atali, the frost-giant's daughter!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" grunted Horsa. "Old Gorm's mind was touched in his
youth by a sword cut on the head. Conan was delirious from the
fury of battle&mdash;look how his helmet is dented. Any of those
blows might have addled his brain. It was an hallucination he
followed into the wastes. He is from the south; what does he know
of Atali?"</p>

<p>"You speak truth, perhaps," muttered Conan. "It was all
strange and weird&mdash;by Crom!"</p>

<p>He broke off, glaring at the object that still dangled from
his clenched left fist; the others gaped silently at the veil he
held up&mdash;a wisp of gossamer that was never spun by human
distaff.</p>
