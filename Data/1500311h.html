<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="first">My older readers will remember the great
sensation that was caused some twenty-odd years ago by the
marriage of Van Sicklen Harker to Cornelia Mittlinger, thus
uniting two of the greatest fortunes in the country. In due
course this couple had a daughter, who was also christened
Cornelia. The newspapers dubbed her the billion dollar baby.
Throughout her childhood items about her feeding bottles, her
lace caps and the diamond buckles on her little slippers
continually found their way into the press. If ever a child was
reared upon publicity this was it. When she was about ten years
old her parents were divorced; and each subsequently re-married;
but Van Harker's second wife and Mrs. Harker's second husband
have nothing to do with this story. Throughout her childhood,
little Cornelia lived in her own great house surrounded by her
own servants; and was visited in turn by her father and
mother.</p>

<p>I suppose the old-timers were astonished when they read in the
papers of little Cornelia's own love affair. That is the way with
children; they will grow up. It may be objected here, that quite
enough about Cornelia Harker's affairs has already been printed.
Upon the death of her father recently, the whole thing was
rehashed in the press. But that is the very reason I have made up
my mind to write it. The exact truth never has been told; and
during the few years that have elapsed since these things
happened, so many fables have become attached to the story, that
it is almost unrecognisable. It is an amazing story, worth
telling for its own sake, quite apart from the prominence of the
people concerned in it.</p>

<p>It broke with dramatic suddenness in the account of how Van
Sicklen Harker, one of the best-known men about town, attempted
to thrash a youth named Arpad Rody in the crowded lobby of the
great Hotel Palazzo. They were separated by friends. Rody was
described as a handsome young Hungarian, who had been engaged by
the hotel as a sort of semi-professional dancer in the tea-room.
The cause of the quarrel was kept out of the papers for the
moment; but of course it was freely whispered about that Cornelia
had become infatuated with her handsome partner in the tango.</p>

<p>A few days later all reason for secrecy vanished, when
Cornelia, then eighteen years old, sent for the reporters to her
house, and bluntly informed them that she was in love with Arpad
Rody, and he with her; and that they intended to get married in
spite of all the fathers in Christendom. What a sensation this
interview caused! Every phase of the affair was conducted in a
blaze of publicity.</p>

<p>Her father countered by summoning the reporters to his house
in turn, and informing them that his daughter was under age; that
she possessed no means in her own right; and that if she
persisted in marrying Rody, whom he termed an unprincipled
adventurer, it was his intention to cut her off without a cent.
Upon this I believe Rody sued Harker for libel; but this side
issue was soon lost sight of in the events which followed.</p>

<p>Cornelia's answer to her father's <i>pronunciamento</i> was to
march out of the great house with which he provided her, carrying
only a satchel containing her dressing-case and night clothes.
She engaged a room in a cheap boarding-house, and hired herself
out as a cashier in a down-town restaurant. The proprietor of the
restaurant had to call on the police for help in handling the
crowds that besieged his place.</p>

<p>After a day or two Harker succeeded in rescuing his daughter
out of the restaurant; and a truce was patched up. Each announced
to the press that a reconciliation had been effected. They
appeared in public together. Young Arpad Rody was not in
evidence. Finally father and daughter departed for a visit to the
Grande Canyon in Harker's private car.</p>

<p>In three days Cornelia was back. She announced that her father
was too dictatorial for her taste, and she was not surprised that
her mother had found it impossible to live with him. She
established herself in her big house again, where Arpad Rody was
a frequent visitor. The young couple were photographed together
twenty times a day. They ostentatiously visited Tiffany's to buy
a ring.</p>

<p>From his house Mr. Harker announced that he and his daughter
were sailing on the <i>Baratoria</i> in a week's time for a world
tour.</p>

<p>From her house Cornelia announced that she had no intention of
leaving New York.</p>

<p>Harker repeated his statement that they were going away.</p>

<p>Cornelia repeated hers that they were not.</p>

<p>The <i>Baratoria</i> was to sail on a Wednesday. On the Monday
a fresh sensation was created by the disappearance of Cornelia
Harker. She had walked out of her house on Sunday afternoon; and
had failed to return. Neither was Arpad Rody to be found. The
father was in a state of distraction.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the young pair turned up smiling. They announced
that they had been married in Wilmington. They did not return to
Cornelia's house, but engaged a suite at the Hotel Palazzo. And
everybody supposed that the play had ended&mdash;ended as plays
ought to be with the discomfiture of the stern father.</p>

<p>Up to this moment it had been pure comedy. It was looked on as
a sort of burlesque upon the evil of having too much money. In
view of the girl's ridiculous bringing up, it was held that
Harker had received no worse than he might have expected. Popular
opinion was bound to be on the side of the handsome young lovers,
who made a bluff of daring poverty for the sake of love. There
was nothing for the father to do but to back down as gracefully
as he could. Good comedy; everybody was laughing at it.</p>

<p>The Tuesday evening papers carried a brief story of the
marriage; and the Wednesday morning papers amplified it. At noon
on Wednesday I was startled by hearing the boys cry an extra in
our street. Their voices suggested that something was really the
matter, so I hastened down to the door and bought a paper. What I
read in it turned me a little sick with horror. An hour before,
Arpad Rody had been found shot dead in the suite at the Palazzo,
with his bride lying in a faint near by.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first">I carried the newspaper to Mme. Storey in her
private office. This was the long room that I have so often
described, furnished with priceless Italian antiques, and lighted
by a row of casements at one end looking out on Gramercy Park.
Here at a wide black oaken table with her back to the windows,
works my beautiful mistress like a chemist in his laboratory,
analysing souls. Like everybody else she had been interested and
amused in following the Harker affair from day to day. When I
showed her the brief, bald announcement, she did not, like
others, waste her breath in protestations of horror. Her face
turned grave. She said:</p>

<p>"Bella, we will be called on to act in this matter. Send a boy
to obtain a room plan of the Palazzo, showing the suite occupied
by the young couple. Make a file of the newspaper reports of the
case. Get in touch with Inspector Rumsey at Headquarters; and
tell him that I would be obliged if he will furnish me with the
latest information. Order Crider and Stephens to report at the
office."</p>

<p>I was back in my own room attending to these instructions,
when the outer door banged open, and four men came tumbling in.
They were well-dressed men; they looked like persons to whom
consideration was due; but at the moment all four had a frantic
air. I had never seen any of them before. They all cried in a
breath:</p>

<p>"Madame Storey...where is she?"</p>

<p>"Who are you, please? And what do you want of her?" I asked in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I am Van Sicklen Harker," said one.</p>

<p>"He is Mr. Van Sicklen Harker," echoed the other three.</p>

<p>"Please be seated," said I, making for the door of Mine.
Storey's room.</p>

<p>I doubt if they heard me. They all seemed half beside
themselves. When I opened the door they pushed in with me. What
could one do?</p>

<p>As it turned out, Mme. Storey was acquainted with Mr. Harker,
and she took in the situation at a glance. All four men began
talking to her at once. I picked out such phrases as: "Rody has
been shot!...Cornelia taken to Headquarters!...We fear she may be
arrested!...No weapon has been found!..."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" protested Mme. Storey, waving her
hands in front of her. "One at a time!...Who are these gentlemen,
Mr. Harker?"</p>

<p>"My friends..." he said helplessly.</p>

<p>He was truly a pitiable object. A man accustomed to show a
good front to the world, his path had always been smoothed for
him, and now he suddenly found the ground cut away. At the touch
of tragedy his weakness was revealed. His hands shook; his eyes
rolled; his tongue stuttered. He looked very young to be the
father of a married daughter; not above forty. The other three
were merely his toadies; his hangers-on. Harker was the type of
millionaire who always carries them around with him. There was
nothing genuine in their distress. They were secretly pleased at
being concerned in such an important affair. They lent a comic
touch to the grim situation.</p>

<p>"What is it you want of me?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Help me...help me!" said Harker imploringly.</p>

<p>He seemed to be unable to get any further; and one of his
friends stepped forward. He was the most intelligent-looking of
the three; a clean-shaven man of indeterminate age with a wary
blue eye. He was elegantly dressed and there was a subtle
assurance in his manner; Fifth Avenue, Newport, Lenox, was
stamped on him, like labels on a piece of luggage. A comely man,
but a little too soft and smooth.</p>

<p>"Poor Harker is overwhelmed," he said solicitously. He had the
flat, reedy voice of his type. "I am Algernon Bleecker. I have
had the pleasure of being presented to you; but perhaps you have
forgotten me."</p>

<p>"I remember you very well," said Mme. Storey with a polite and
inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>"How nice of you," purred Mr. Bleecker. "Let me explain this
matter to you."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," interrupted Mme. Storey, "but I must deal with
the principal. If you gentlemen will be good enough to wait in
the outer room..."</p>

<p>All three gentlemen were indignant; but they dared not show it
openly in the light of my mistress's cool and level glance. With
angry glances among themselves, they retired into my office. I
have no doubt Mme. Storey was well abused in there.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Mme. Storey more kindly to Harker. He dropped
into a chair. She pushed the cigarette box towards him. "Perhaps
a few puffs will steady you." He mechanically helped himself to a
cigarette, but forgot to light it.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together!" said Mme. Storey in her blunt and
cheery fashion. "This is a bad matter; but it might have been
worse. It might have been your daughter who was shot."</p>

<p>"They have taken her...to Police headquarters," he stammered
like a man distraught.</p>

<p>"I understand no weapon was found," said Mme. Storey. "And if
she did shoot him, she probably had good cause."</p>

<p>"She <i>couldn't</i> have done it!" said poor Harker. "She was
infatuated with him, God help her. He had laid a spell on her
with his confounded Continental manners; kissing her hand, and so
on. After that our honest, rough and ready American boys had no
attraction."</p>

<p>"Well then, let us find who <i>did</i> do it."</p>

<p>"But if they let her go, they will fasten it on me!" cried
Harker, all but wringing his hands. "For I was the last one to
see them together."</p>

<p>"Did you shoot him?" asked Mme. Storey quite calmly.</p>

<p>"No! No! No!" he cried. "I swear it!"</p>

<p>"Tell me the whole story," said my mistress. "Begin at the
point where you first learned that your daughter was married to
Rody."</p>

<p>He made a visible effort to calm himself. "That was yesterday
afternoon," he said. "Cornelia called me up."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"Very little. Just a bare announcement. Asked me to come to
see them at the Palazzo at ten to-day."</p>

<p>"But was it not her place to come to see you?"</p>

<p>He shrugged helplessly.</p>

<p>"That is Cornelia's way. I can't do anything with
her...Besides, she and my wife do not get along together."</p>

<p>"Did she say what she wanted to see you about?"</p>

<p>"No. But of course I knew. It was to discuss a
settlement."</p>

<p>"But you had said you would do nothing for them."</p>

<p>He spread out his hands helplessly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't let my girl starve."</p>

<p>"Did you hear from them again before this morning?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You went there at ten?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Please tell me exactly what happened."</p>

<p>He jumped up agitatedly.</p>

<p>"I can't remember everything," he cried. "It was too
painful...too painful! A long wrangle!...I expected Rody to stand
out for all he could get. That didn't trouble me. I thought
perhaps it might bring her to her senses to see him revealed in
his true colours. But no! She supported him throughout. She was
worse than he! Oh, to see my own child taking sides against me
with that young blackguard...it was more than I could bear!...I
can't remember everything that was said. It went on for an
hour..."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't press you now," said Mme. Storey. "But if I am
to help you, I shall have to question you again. What was the
upshot? Did you agree to a settlement?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I agreed to give them five hundred thousand down and to
allow them ten thousand dollars a month hereafter."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I wrote a letter to that effect, and signed it," Harker
added. "It was found by the police."</p>

<p>"Why was it necessary to write a letter?" asked Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"Rody exacted it."</p>

<p>"Supported by your daughter?"</p>

<p>"She wasn't in the room at that moment. She had become faint.
She was under the care of her maid."</p>

<p>"How many rooms had they?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. Three I think; and two bathrooms. It was a
corner suite looking out on Fifty-seventh Street. You entered it
through a private foyer which had six sides, and a door in each
side. The corner room was the sitting-room. My daughter's maid
occupied a room to the left of the sitting-room, and my
daughter's room was on the right. At Rody's suggestion, we went
into that room to talk so that the maid could not overhear."</p>

<p>"And it was in that room that the body was found?"</p>

<p>"So I suppose. I do not know for certain."</p>

<p>"What happened when your daughter felt ill?"</p>

<p>"She went back into the sitting-room."</p>

<p>"How long were you alone with Rody?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Five minutes; ten minutes."</p>

<p>"After you had written the letter did you see your daughter
again?"</p>

<p>"No. What was the use? She was on his side. I was too sore and
bitter. I got out as quick as I could."</p>

<p>"Through the sitting-room?"</p>

<p>"No. There was a door from the bedroom into the foyer. I went
that way."</p>

<p>"Are you able to fix the time when you left?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I got down into the street I noticed that it was
five minutes to eleven."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey glanced at the newspaper.</p>

<p>"The body was found at ten minutes past."</p>

<p>"So they say."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harker, do you own a revolver?" she asked bluntly.</p>

<p>His eyes rolled wildly. "I...I suppose so," he stammered. "In
fact I think I have several. But it is many years since I have
had any occasion to handle...to look at them..."</p>

<p>"But somehow, one does not forget one's guns," said Mme.
Storey mildly. "You must realise how important to you this
question is. Can't you give me a more explicit answer?"</p>

<p>"I...I should have to think it over..." he said nervously.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey appeared to let the matter go.</p>

<p>"One last question," she said. "What did your daughter say
upon regaining consciousness?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen her," said Harker. "I am told that she has
refused to make any statement whatsoever."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Harker wanted to carry Mme. Storey down to
Police Headquarters that she might interview Cornelia. "No use my
trying to talk to her," he said bitterly.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mme. Storey, "I'll go. We are rather a large
party. Is it necessary for the gentlemen outside to accompany
us?"</p>

<p>"They are good friends of mine," said Harker.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Still..."</p>

<p>"I'll send them away," said Harker.</p>

<p>"Let Mr. Bleecker come with us," suggested my mistress. "I'd
like to talk to him."</p>

<p>As we were leaving the office we met our operative, Stephens,
coming in in response to my summons. Mme. Storey, dropping back,
instructed him to get hold of Mr. Harker's valet if he was able,
and bring him down to Headquarters. They were to wait outside in
a car.</p>

<p>The four of us set off down town in the Harker limousine. Mme.
Storey sat on the back seat between Mr. Harker and Mr. Bleecker;
while I was on one of the extra seats in front of them. I do not
believe that Harker opened his mouth the whole way. Mme. Storey
and Mr. Bleecker talked. She was affable and friendly as if she
had repented of snubbing him; but I, who know her methods so
well, could see that she was sounding him out. He answered like a
man without a care on his mind. He had a boyish, impulsive
manner, which may have been a pose, but was not unattractive.</p>

<p>From his talk I learned (a) that his family was one of the
best in New York; and that he was related to all the other
Knickerbockers: (b) That he pursued no regular occupation, but
lived the life of a gentleman of leisure: (c) That "Society" was
the be-all and end-all of his existence: (d) That for many years
he had acted as a sort of superior social secretary to the
billionaire Harkers; that is to say, he had supervised all their
entertainments, and had advised them whom to cultivate, and whom
to drop. It was clear that Harker leaned on him to an absurd
degree. During the drive no reference was made to the immediate
tragedy.</p>

<p>We must have been expected at Police Headquarters, for we
found a whole brigade of press photographers lined up on the
sidewalk. Mme. Storey's appearance in the case created an
additional sensation. Inside, the whole building was pervaded by
an air of excitement; and I may say it takes something out of the
common to get them going at 300 Mulberry Street. The hardest-boiled door-keeper amongst them was affected by it. Even the high
officials, who are in general no respecters of persons, were
impressed by the magic name of Harker. Clearly they did not know
exactly what to do with so grand a young lady as Cornelia. They
had tried to get information out of her, but had not liked to
push her too hard.</p>

<p>We were taken up to a big room on the second floor where a
sort of informal investigation was in progress. Everybody
connected with the case was coming and going. We found that the
police end was in charge of our friend Inspector Rumsey. There
was also a representative of the district attorney's office
present; a man called Harden, whom we were to know only too well
in another case. A well-known criminal lawyer named John Jerrold
was representing Cornelia. With Jerrold was his clerk, a dark,
Spanish lad as handsome as Antinous. I did not learn his name
until later. It was Pedro d'Escobar.</p>

<p>I wondered about this Jerrold. He was quite well-known; but
why had they not engaged one of the best in town, I asked myself.
A curious thing was, that, though he was working in Cornelia's
interest, he received Mme. Storey with scarcely veiled
antagonism. Inspector Rumsey was perfectly willing to allow my
mistress to question the girl in the presence of the police, but
Jerrold said no.</p>

<p>"I must stand upon the rights of my client," he said stiffly.
"A charge may be laid later." So saying, he went off to consult
with Cornelia.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey made no comment; but Harker looked at Bleecker in
surprise.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?" he asked.</p>

<p>Bleecker shrugged. "Jealous," he said. "He is afraid that
Madame Storey will steal the limelight. These court-room stars
are as temperamental as opera singers. I'll speak to him."</p>

<p>A succession of prospective witnesses was examined while I was
in the room; Cornelia's maid; guests who had occupied nearby
rooms; various employees of the hotel. None of these people were
able to say they had heard the sound of a shot.</p>

<p>I listened to the maid's story with keen interest. At ten
o'clock that morning she had admitted Mr. Van Sicklen Harker to
the suite, and had ushered him into the sitting-room. She had
then returned to her own room. At first she could hear nothing.
When the gentlemen began to quarrel she could hear the angry
voices, but could not distinguish anything that was said.</p>

<p>She had no suspicion of any serious trouble until, a good
while after, her mistress called her into the sitting-room. She
found Cornelia in a hysterical and half-fainting condition. While
in the sitting-room, she could hear the angry voices of the men
in the bedroom; but she had been too much concerned about her
mistress's condition to take note of anything they said. She half
led, half carried her mistress into the further bedroom; that is
to say the maid's own room, where Cornelia fainted on the bed.
Some time passed before she succeeded in bringing her to; she was
unable to say just how long. When she came to her senses, though
she was still weak and shaken, she insisted on returning to the
men. She ordered the maid to remain in her own room. During all
this time she had said nothing that gave the maid any clue as to
what the men were quarrelling about.</p>

<p>The maid had remained in her own room for awhile. She could
hear nothing. She became very anxious. She finally ventured out
into the foyer. Still she could hear nothing from the bedroom
opposite. She listened at the door of that room and no sound came
to her. At last she knocked. There was no answer. She tried the
door. It was not locked, yet it resisted her at the bottom. She
thought somebody was holding it. There was no sound from inside.
Screaming with terror, the maid ran out into the main corridor of
the hotel. A number of the guests ran out of their rooms; and
various employees were attracted to the scene. The maid refused
to return to the suite; and it was a hall-porter who actually
discovered the tragedy.</p>

<p>This man stated that he had not attempted to enter the bedroom
from the foyer; but had gone through the bathroom which lay
between bedroom and sitting-room. None of the doors were locked.
He beheld Arpad Rody lying on his back on the bed with a gaping
wound in his temple. Mrs. Rody was crumpled up in a heap against
the door into the foyer. That was why the maid had been unable to
open it. There was a smell of gunpowder in the room. There was no
gun visible anywhere. The wound had bled some on the bed, but not
so much as you might expect. Rody's clothing was not disarranged
in any way; nor did the room show any indications that a struggle
had taken place. The body was still warm, of course; but as far
as the porter could tell, the man was already dead. The next
persons to enter the room were the hotel physician, and one of
the managers. The porter had then been stationed at the door to
keep everybody else out.</p>

<p>The physician deposed that the man was dead when he first
looked at him. Death must have been instantaneous. He had been
shot with a bullet from a gun of .32 calibre. The gun must have
been pressed close to his head. The bullet had passed through his
brain and was lodged against the skull on the other side. The
physician had also discovered a swelling on top of the man's
head, which suggested that he had been struck by some instrument;
probably a blunt instrument; but he could not say positively.
There was no abrasion. The lady was only in a swoon. She was
carried into another room and brought to her senses. The doctor
described, meanwhile, the vain hunt for a weapon. When the lady
recovered, she had broken away from those who were attending her,
and had rushed back to her husband's body, where she gave vent to
extravagant protestations of affection. Nothing that she said
suggested that she had any knowledge of who had shot him. She was
incapable at that moment of answering any questions
intelligibly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey asked permission of Inspector Rumsey to put a few
questions: This was readily accorded her.</p>

<p>"Doctor," she said, "please tell us more particularly the
position in which you found the body."</p>

<p>He said: "There were two beds in the room, Madame, which were
shoved together. The body was lying across both of them, the head
pointing towards the windows."</p>

<p>"Were the legs touching the floor?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame, the body was lying completely across the
beds."</p>

<p>"Had the room been made up for the day?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame, the bed-clothing was tumbled."</p>

<p>"The door into the foyer, I take it, was opposite to the
windows?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Madame. The foyer being an irregularly shaped
room, the door was cut across one corner of the bedroom."</p>

<p>"I see. And where was the door into the bathroom?"</p>

<p>"Facing the foot of the beds, Madame."</p>

<p>"These were the only doors in the room?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame. There was a door near the head of the beds, on
the side above the windows. This led into a clothes closet. We
looked in there for the gun."</p>

<p>"I get it. We can check this up later on the plan. Now please
tell us what sort of a man, physically, the victim was in
life."</p>

<p>"A very well-made young man, Madame; tall and muscular."</p>

<p>"A difficult customer to handle, eh?"</p>

<p>"So I should say, Madame."</p>

<p>"About what weight?"</p>

<p>"A hundred and seventy pounds."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now please describe the effect when a man is shot
through the brain."</p>

<p>"Why, Madame, he drops like a felled ox."</p>

<p>"There is no movement afterwards?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame&mdash;That is, if he was in motion when he was
shot, he might stagger forward a step, or spin around. But if he
was standing, he would drop all of a piece."</p>

<p>"Was there blood anywhere in the room except where it had run
down on the bed?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. That is all."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">John Jerrold returned to the room, and announced
to Inspector Rumsey that his client was now ready to make a full
statement to the police. This made all the members of our party
uneasy. We didn't know what was coming. It would have been far
better for the girl, we thought, if Mme. Storey had been
permitted to talk to her first. But Jerrold was evidently
determined to keep his client out of my mistress's hands. Mme.
Storey could not seek to interfere between Cornelia and her
counsel. She merely shrugged.</p>

<p>Inspector Rumsey ordered the girl to be brought in.</p>

<p>The big room was full of people. I did not know who they all
were, nor what their business might be with the case. Inspector
Rumsey sat at a desk with his back to the windows; the assistant-District-Attorney was on one side of him, my mistress on the
other. I sat close to her with my pencil and book in case she
wished to dictate any memoranda. There was also a police
stenographer present. Lined up behind us was a whole crowd of
police; some in uniform, some in plain clothes. The rest of the
persons connected with the case formed a group at the other side
of the room. No representatives of the press were admitted at
this juncture.</p>

<p>A curious thing was, that in all that crowd there was not one
to claim kinship or friendship with the slain man. Nor did any
ever appear during the progress of the case. This young fellow
who was described as being so good-looking in life, seemed to
have appeared out of a void, just as he had now disappeared into
another. There was no way of telling if he was as bad as the
Harkers made out, because he had no one to speak in his
defence.</p>

<p>While we waited for the girl, John Jerrold paced back and
forth with an important manner. He was a stocky, middle-aged man
with a cold grey eye, and a bristly, clipped moustache. He had
once been connected with the District-Attorney's office; and he
had the look of the overbearing prosecutor of fiction. Perhaps
that was the reason he had been dropped.</p>

<p>Finally an inner door was opened; a policeman stepped in
followed by the slight figure of Cornelia Rody; and another
officer who closed the door behind him. You could hear everybody
in the room take a breath at the sight of this little girl; this
heiress to untold millions; this bride of a day, who had perhaps
seen her handsome young husband shot down by&mdash;well, of
course the sane thought was in everybody's mind.</p>

<p>She scarcely looked her eighteen years; it was piteous to
think of her as one of the principals in a tragedy. She was very
pretty too, with fine blue eyes and a mass of short, curly,
bright brown hair. She was, it goes without saying, most
expensively and beautifully dressed. But it was rather shocking
to see how perfectly self-assured she was under those
circumstances. That was the rich man's child brought up with a
crowd of servants to wait upon her. She was very pale it is true,
but she looked around at the crowd with the greatest coolness,
and made a signal of reassurance to her father. She then seated
herself in the chair which the young Spaniard, Jerrold's clerk,
pushed forward for her; crossed her pretty feet, and folded her
hands in her lap.</p>

<p>Her father looked to be at the point of collapse. I did not at
first grasp the significance of the signal that Cornelia made
him, but I saw my mistress's face become grave.</p>

<p>"You wish to make a statement," said Inspector Rumsey to
Cornelia.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said composedly. "It was I who shot Arpad
Rody."</p>

<p>Everybody in the room gasped. This was not what we expected to
hear. Harker leaped to his feet; and his chair fell over
backwards. He flung a hand across his eyes. "No! No! No!" he
cried. "It cannot be!"</p>

<p>A policeman pressed him back into his chair. He covered his
face.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Rumsey sharply to the girl. "Do you realise what
you are saying? Are you speaking by advice of counsel?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"Why did you not warn us of this?" asked Rumsey of
Jerrold.</p>

<p>"I thought it best to let her speak for herself," answered
Jerrold with a defiant stare.</p>

<p>"You might at least have given her friends some inkling."</p>

<p>Jerrold merely shrugged.</p>

<p>Cornelia, having been duly warned, continued her statement;
and it was taken down. She spoke in a low, clear voice; her
expression never varied. She related the terrible story without a
falter. "Immediately after the ceremony," she said, "my husband
revealed his true nature. It was a relief to be himself, he told
me with a sneer. He was coarse and brutal and selfish. His one
aim was to get as much money as possible out of my father, when
my father came to us this morning, I was so ashamed I could
scarcely face him. But I had married this man in the face of his
opposition, and I felt that it was up to me to stick it out. So I
made believe to side with my husband against my father; though it
hurt me very much. They quarrelled violently, and it got to be
more than I could bear. That is how I came to faint."</p>

<p>Cornelia then described how, upon feeling ill, she had gone
into the sitting-room and had called her maid. The maid had
carried her to a bed in the further room, where she lost
consciousness for a space.</p>

<p>Continuing, Cornelia said: "When I came to myself, I went back
to the room where I had left the men. I found that my father had
gone. Arpad was lying on his back across the beds feeling very
pleased with himself, because he had got the better of my father.
He had forced my father to sign an agreement to pay us a large
sum. I didn't mind that; but when he went on to abuse my father,
to call him dreadful names&mdash;after he had been so generous to
us&mdash;I felt as if I could stand no more. In fact I didn't
know what I was doing. The pistol was lying there on the bureau.
I just picked it up and shot him. He never moved after."</p>

<p>"But the doctor has stated that the pistol must have been held
directly against the man's temple," said Rumsey.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cornelia. "Arpad couldn't see what I was doing
because of the footboard of the bed. I picked up the pistol from
the bureau, and walked to the bed, holding it down low. I reached
over the footboard, and put it to his head and fired...He never
moved after."</p>

<p>I think everybody in the room shuddered at the repetition of
that dreadful little phrase.</p>

<p>"Are you accustomed to handling pistols?" Rumsey asked her in
rather a shaky voice.</p>

<p>"No. I just pulled the trigger and it went off."</p>

<p>The good inspector was deeply moved; he had a daughter of
Cornelia's age. "This story cannot be true!" he said loudly, and
looked truculently around, as if defying any of his men to say
that he was not acting the part of a good policeman. "If you shot
the man as you say, the gun must have been found
afterwards...What became of the gun?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Cornelia in the same composed voice. "In
fact I cannot remember anything else. It all went black before
me."</p>

<p>"The gun was not found!" cried the Inspector, striking his
desk.</p>

<p>"I do not know about that," said Cornelia, with a sort of
quiet obstinacy. "I have told you what happened."</p>

<p>"Whose gun was it?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I supposed it was Arpad's."</p>

<p>"Had it been lying on the bureau when you were in the room
before?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure. I don't think it could have been. It occurred
to me that Arpad might have used it to intimidate my father."</p>

<p>"Did you know that your husband possessed such a gun?"</p>

<p>"He had spoken of owning a gun, but I do not know what kind it
was. He had never shown it to me."</p>

<p>"You say you fainted immediately upon the firing of the shot?"
asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know that your husband never moved?"</p>

<p>"Well, I looked at him first. I didn't faint until it came
over me that he was dead."</p>

<p>"You can remember nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"But you were found leaning against the door to the foyer. How
did you get there?"</p>

<p>"I supposed I must have staggered there. It wouldn't be but
half a dozen steps from the bed."</p>

<p>Inspector Rumsey flung himself back in his chair nonplussed.
He didn't want to believe the girl's story, but as a witness
against herself she was too much for him. He looked at my
mistress. When she was present he always leaned heavily on her.
What do you think of this? his eyes asked. Mme. Storey shrugged
non-committally.</p>

<p>"Do you want to ask her any questions?" asked Rumsey.</p>

<p>"Not at present," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>While Cornelia was signing the statement which had been
prepared for her, another plain clothes man entered the room by
the outside door, and going directly to Inspector Rumsey,
whispered something in his ear. Rumsey started violently, and
said: "Where is it?"</p>

<p>By way of answer, the man took an automatic pistol from his
pocket and laid it on Rumsey's desk. Again one could feel the
thrill of excitement go through the whole company there.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?" asked Rumsey.</p>

<p>"On the roof of the dwelling-house which adjoins the Hôtel
Palazzo on the Fifty-Seventh street side."</p>

<p>"That would be under the windows of the room where the man was
shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Cornelia spoke up quickly: "Oh, it just comes back to me now.
In my excitement I threw the gun out of the window. You had
better add that to my statement."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jerrold," cried the exasperated Inspector, "will you
please warn your client, for her own sake, to confine herself to
answering my questions!"</p>

<p>Jerrold retorted sharply, and some confusion resulted. Under
cover of it, Mme. Storey leaned towards me, and whispered: "Go
down to the door. If Stephens is there with the man I sent him
for, bring the man up here."</p>

<p>I found Stephens and another man waiting in a car below. The
man's name was Clemmons. He was a tall, weedy-looking youth
dressed in a style of cheap elegance; in fact a typical valet. He
was sweating with nervousness at the prospect of having to face
the police.</p>

<p>When I re-entered the room with Clemmons, Mr. Harker looked at
him in mute horror, while his bosom friend, Bleecker, flushed red
with anger.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Clemmons," said the youth with a nervous simper. "I
work for Mr. Harker."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey whispered to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen this gun before?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>Clemmons turned the gun over in his hands, and then laid it
down on the desk. He glanced wildly around as if seeking a way of
escape.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" said the Inspector sharply.</p>

<p>"Do I&mdash;do I have to answer?" stammered Clemmons,</p>

<p>Algernon Bleecker jumped up. "I protest!" he cried. "This man
is entitled to the advice of counsel."</p>

<p>"Be silent, sir!" cried Inspector Rumsey. "Nobody suspects
this man of having committed the crime!" He looked at Clemmons.
"Answer my question!"</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Harker's gun," murmured the valet. Everybody in the
room strained forward to hear. The silence was breathless.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" demanded the Inspector.</p>

<p>Clemmons nodded. "I cleaned it only last week," he murmured.
"I saw Mr. Harker take it out of the drawer this morning before
he went out. He did not know that I saw him take it."</p>

<p>You could hear a long breath escape from the strained
listeners.</p>

<p>Inspector Rumsey involuntarily looked over at Cornelia. It was
then that the girl betrayed her only symptoms of cracking under
the strain.</p>

<p>"What of it?" she cried hysterically. "I told you the truth!
Arpad was alive after my father had left the hotel! I swear
it!"</p>

<p>I heard a slight sound on the other side of me. Then Mr.
Bleecker cried excitedly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Harker has fainted! A glass of water, please!"</p>

<p>The faithful toady conveyed by his horrified tones that the
Heavens had fallen, and all business must stop. But I am afraid
nobody else in the room was much impressed by the multi-millionaire's greatness at that moment.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="first">Cornelia's confession stood up in spite of the
valet's disclosure. No person of discernment who heard the girl
make that confession believed a word of it-but there it was! She
stuck to it through thick and thin; and even added convincing
little details from time to time.</p>

<p>Harker was obliged to change his story. Who could tell whether
his second version was any nearer the truth than the first? He
said:</p>

<p>"It is true that I took my pistol with me when I went to see
Rody. I was beside myself with rage and grief, and it seemed to
me when the truth came out that nobody would blame me for
shooting that blackguard. In the ugly scene that followed after I
got to the hotel, he revealed his nature to be even more brutal
and coarse than I had expected. The thought that my little girl
was committed to the keeping of such a scoundrel drove me mad! It
seemed providential to me when Cornelia left us together; and I
pulled out my gun. If the intention of shooting him is a crime, I
am ready to take my punishment. But I did not shoot him. He
jumped on me and disarmed me. He was stronger than I. He then
pointed the gun at my head, and made me write the agreement that
I left behind me. As I ran out of the room I heard him fling the
gun on the bureau. This is the truth! But Cornelia could not have
shot him either. Whatever she may say now, she was completely
infatuated with the man!"</p>

<p>A curious situation resulted. Whenever Harker was permitted to
see his daughter, he begged and implored her to take back her
confession, but she stood firm. Throughout the whole affair she
displayed much more strength of character than her father. If she
had weakened, Harker would have been promptly arrested, but as
long as her confession stood, the police could not touch him.</p>

<p>Everybody believed that Harker had shot Rody, and nobody was
inclined to blame him for it. It was supposed that Cornelia knew
her father had done it, even if she had not actually seen him
fire the shot, and that she was lying to save him. And Harker,
people thought, was withholding his confession, because he
considered that Cornelia's youth and innocence would stand a
better chance with a jury. If this was the true explanation of
the situation, it certainly showed up poor Harker in a
contemptible light; and in my heart I never believed it. Harker
was a weak man, and somewhat spoiled by too much wealth, but
there was something manly and likeable in him underneath. And
certainly the poor fellow was suffering the torments of the
damned.</p>

<p>No other explanation was forthcoming. If neither one of the
Harkers had shot Arpad Rody we were up against a blank wall. The
whole action was narrowed down to fifteen or twenty minutes. No
other person had been seen to enter or leave the hotel suite. In
a hotel like the Palazzo, they have watchers and servants in
every corridor. Cornelia's maid had never left the suite, and the
outer door had been locked throughout. One of the lost baffling
features of the case was that nobody had heard the shot.</p>

<p>What my mistress thought about the case at this stage, I do
not know. She went about her investigation with an inscrutable
smile. I ought to mention that immediately after the inquiry in
Inspector Rumsey's office which I have described, she proceeded
to the Palazzo Hôtel where she made a patient survey of the scene
of the crime.</p>

<p>If it was a fact that the Harkers and their advisers had
agreed amongst themselves on the course of action they were
following, it certainly proved to be a politic one. For Cornelia
became the heroine of the day. It was true she had to be confined
in the city prison, but if one could believe all one heard, she
was treated there like a royal guest of the state. She received
enough flowers and candy, it was said, to furnish an entire
hospital. Two secretaries were required to attend to her mail.
Everybody knew that her trial would be a mere form; no jury on
earth would have convicted her.</p>

<p>Cornelia was naturally a sweet little thing, and the course
she was taking, mistaken though it might be, proved the goodness
of her heart. But long before this happened she had been spoiled
by her bad upbringing; and the adulation she received in prison
completed the turning of her pretty head. She became as puffed up
with vanity as a little pigeon. It was very difficult to deal
with her. As a matter of fact somebody had prejudiced her against
Mme. Storey in the beginning. After one or two attempts to create
a better understanding, Mme. Storey was obliged to disregard her
in the unravelling of the case.</p>

<p>I might say, that saving Mme. Storey and Inspector Rumsey,
everybody connected with this case seemed to become intoxicated
with the attendant publicity. That is not to be surprised at,
perhaps, when you consider that it was the most sensational case
that had ever come before the public up to that time. The
newspapers seemed to give up everything else during those few
days. The reporters and photographers dogged our footsteps. Good
Heavens! you had the feeling of being spied upon even in your
bed. The publicity attached to our cases always angers me. Maybe
if I were the beautiful young heiress to millions I should feel
differently.</p>

<p>Too much publicity has a curious effect on people. Algernon
Bleecker, I thought, made a perfect ass of himself, the way he
thrust himself forward as Van Sicklen Harker's most intimate
friend, and undertook to speak for Harker in everything. The
others were almost as bad. Even the valet Clemmons went about
town attended by a whole train of sycophants hanging upon his
slightest word. As for Cornelia, she issued interviews from her
cell on every conceivable subject, whether she knew anything
about it or not.</p>

<p>Cornelia was thrown entirely into the hands of John Jerrold. I
considered this very unfortunate. I did not believe that Jerrold
was actuated merely by childish jealousy in his antagonism to my
mistress. I suspected a more sinister motive. When I suggested
this to my mistress she merely smiled. I hate the whole
multimillionaire atmosphere anyway. There is more wire-pulling,
underhand dealing and general crookedness amongst their hangers-on than in ward politics.</p>

<p>When Jerrold did not go himself to visit Cornelia in the
prison, he employed the handsome Spanish lad, Pedro d'Escobar, as
his messenger.</p>

<p>One day when Mme. Storey and I went to the prison to talk to
Cornelia (and this, by the way, was the last occasion on which my
mistress made any attempt to see the girl she was trying to save)
we were told at the gate that Miss Harker (Cornelia had resumed
her maiden name for its effect on the public) was already in the
visitors' room engaged with her counsel. We had to wait in the
rotunda at some little distance from the door, but in full view
of it. It was fairly dark where we were.</p>

<p>While we sat there, the door in to the visitors' room was
opened, and for an instant we saw two figures framed in the
doorway, sharply silhouetted against the strong light within. It
was Cornelia and&mdash;not the gross form of Jerrold&mdash;but
the slender one of young d'Escobar. A very pretty pose; the
graceful girl offering her hand to the youth, who took it in his
own, and gazed at her, as we could see even at that distance,
with an expression of adoration. He then bent his body with
infinite grace, and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>This troubled me greatly, but I could not instantly piece
together the reasons for it. Then a light broke on me. I glanced
at my mistress. She was surveying the scene with a peculiar
smile.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in?" I said.</p>

<p>She slowly shook her head. "No need now," she said
enigmatically. "This has revealed more than I would ever get out
of the girl."</p>

<p>She drew me over to the other side of the rotunda where
d'Escobar would not pass us on the way out. I watched him with
the keenest interest. He was almost the perfect Latin type of
male beauty, with large, full dark eyes, features of a charming
regularity, and an air of suppressed passion. He was not very
big, but well-knit and vigorous. He ought to have been acting in
the pictures. He was too good-looking for one to be able to judge
anything about his character. He might have been either rogue or
saint.</p>

<p>After he had left, Mme. Storey and I made our way out of the
building.</p>

<p>On the following day we ran into young d'Escobar at the Harker
house where he had been sent on some errand by Cornelia. A
sidelong look from my mistress; an alluring smile was sufficient;
the youth succumbed forthwith. He was apt in gallantry; in fact
that was all there was to him; he had more gallantry than good
sense. It must be remembered though, that my mistress was an
extremely beautiful woman. Beside her, little Cornelia was as a
candle to a star. A moment later they were whispering and smiling
apart, and I was not surprised therefore when the young Spaniard
turned up at our office that afternoon.</p>

<p>He was most beautifully turned out, and his big black eyes
were shining. His manners even towards me, were charming. I had
it in mind though, that a charming young man can be a bad egg,
too. It was about four-thirty, and tea had been had in for him.
My mistress had put on one of her beautiful Fortuny gowns for his
benefit. When I ushered him into the big room, she looked at me
in a certain way, and reached under her desk. This was to signify
that I was not expected to remain in the room, but was to listen
to all that took place. She had turned on the dictaphone.</p>

<p>Back in my own room, I locked the outer door to forestall
possible interruptions, and clapped the headpiece over my ears.
The young man talked an attractive jargon of American slang with
a strong Spanish accent. I shall not attempt to reproduce the
accent. He said:</p>

<p>"I would catch the devil from my boss if he knew I was
here!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mme. Storey lazily.</p>

<p>"He doesn't like you...very bad taste, I say."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"I don't know. He thinks you're trying to&mdash;what do you
say? gum his game somehow."</p>

<p>"I don't know what his game is," said Mme. Storey
laughing.</p>

<p>"To the Dickens with him!" said the young man. "I shan't tell
him where I've been...<i>Dios!</i> how beautiful you are when you
show your white teeth!"</p>

<p>"Like the wolf in Red Riding Hood," said Mme. Storey
airily.</p>

<p>"Voolf? What is that?" he asked in a surprised voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind."</p>

<p>"They tell me you are the cleverest woman in New York," he
went on; "and for myself I can see you are the most beautiful!
How good of you to let me come here!"</p>

<p>"You're a fast worker, aren't you?" she said. "Here's your
tea."</p>

<p>"A fast worker?" he said inquiringly. "Oh, I get you! That's a
good one. I must remember that."</p>

<p>"How about little Harker?" suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mees 'Arker," he said carelessly "I have to make love to
her in the way of duty, but my heart is not in it. But with
you..."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey interrupted him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, duty?"</p>

<p>"A widow," he said, "and so rich! One owes it to oneself."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Unfortunately in this
country a man is expected to be faithful even to a rich
wife."</p>

<p>"How tiresome!" said d'Escobar. "We manage better on the
Continent."</p>

<p>Their conversation (which I took down at the time) was too
long to reproduce in its entirety. Suffice it to say that this
young sprig was like wax in the clever hands of my mistress.
Without committing herself to anything, she allowed him to
suppose that his big black eyes had found a joint in her armour,
and he became a little drunk with gratified vanity. She led him
into making many admissions about himself. He knew how dangerous
his situation was, for he was continually pulling himself up on
the verge of some important disclosure. If he had had good sense
he would never have come near our shop; it was about as safe tor
him as a lion's den; but my mistress's beauty and allure had been
too strong for him. I could see (or hear, rather), that he
thought he was being very prudent, he had no idea how much he was
giving away.</p>

<p>He said he had been in America for a year. He claimed to be
descended from old Spanish grandee stock, but that was palpably a
fiction. Under the veneer of elegance he revealed a sharp and
common nature. I suspect that he had assumed the aristocratic
name of d'Escobar for American use. We gathered that in Madrid he
had really been of that flash type of sporting character which is
common to great cities all over the world, a hanger-on of the
bull-ring, and an associate of the most disreputable persons. He
had been put to all sorts of shifts to make a living, and had
unquestionably known what it was to go hungry. Among other
expedients he had occasionally acted as a guide to tourists in
Madrid, and in this way he had become acquainted with an
American, who had offered to bring him to America anu put him in
the way of winning a rich wife.</p>

<p>This interesting fact slipped out inadvertently; d'Escobar,
laughing instantly sought to turn it into a joke. Mme. Storey
accepted it as a joke, and allowed him to change the subject. By
the most circuitous course she gradually led him back to the fact
of his American benefactor, and d'Escobar never realised whither
he was being steered. He was very leery of giving any information
in this direction. He could not be got to say anything definite
about the man. He repeated that he had been given the money for
his passage to America, but claimed that he had never seen the
man after. Mme. Storey could not question d'Escobar directly, of
course.</p>

<p>"What a funny man!" she said carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, he had so much money he didn't know what to do with it,"
said d'Escobar.</p>

<p>"Then I hope he staked you well."</p>

<p>"Staked me?"</p>

<p>"Gave you money, I mean, to get a start with."</p>

<p>"No. Only for my passage."</p>

<p>"What! Didn't he put you in the way of getting a job? Didn't
he even give you letters to his acquaintances in America?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What a heartless way to act!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he was a rich and impulsive Señor. Five minutes after he
had given me the money he had forgotten me."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say you showed pluck in venturing across the
world to an unknown country where you couldn't even speak the
language."</p>

<p>"What would you?" said d'Escobar; and I could imagine the
careless shrug that accompanied the words. "My position in Madrid
was hopeless. What is a gentleman to do without money? I am the
last of my family. I had no influential relatives. In Spain a
d'Escobar could not soil his hands with common labour; but in
America it makes no difference.</p>

<p>"That's a fine spirit," said Mme. Storey flatteringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let's talk about me," he said. "Let me go on
telling you how beautiful you are! I could never tire of
that!"</p>

<p>I could imagine my mistress's slightly bored smile. But she
gave him his head, and he rhapsodised to his heart's content. She
encouraged him with sly flattery. After a while she said:</p>

<p>"You poor boy! Do you know I am haunted by the thought of you
landing in America friendless and without a cent!"</p>

<p>At this moment he was slightly giddy with gratified vanity,
and he answered thoughtlessly: "Oh, I was well taken care
of!"</p>

<p>To cover his slip&mdash;for she did not want him to break
down, Mme. Storey said quickly: "By your fellow-Spaniards, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "Spaniards. They got me jobs of one kind and
another. As soon as I learned English I was all right."</p>

<p>"You speak it awfully well."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a question of life or death," he said with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Did you have to live in one of those awful immigrant
boarding-houses down near the Battery?" asked my mistress
solicitously.</p>

<p>"No; but it wasn't much better. It was a tall house
overhanging a cliff with rocks at the bottom, and the river. You
could toss things out of our windows right in the water."</p>

<p>"Oh, somewhere out of town," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"No. It is right in New York. The Sound steamers go by."</p>

<p>"I never heard of any cliffs in New York," said Mine. Storey,
to lead him on.</p>

<p>"It was a polyglot house," he said. "There were six of us; a
Frenchman, a Belgian, two Italians, a Rumanian and me."</p>

<p>"All young fellows?" asked Mme. Storey idly. "All young."</p>

<p>"Only six of you in that big house? That doesn't sound
poverty-stricken."</p>

<p>"Oh, we only had a flat on the ground floor. It was a fifteen
family house."</p>

<p>"Well, with six young fellows together, I expect you had a
lively time."</p>

<p>"No. They kept us too strict. The Countess was an old
devil!"</p>

<p>"The Countess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a name we had for the French housekeeper. I was
thankful when I graduated. All day long they kept us at our
lessons like schoolboys; English and deportment."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey took pains not to notice this slip, but he
immediately became conscious of it. "Of course I didn't have to
have any lessons in deportment," he hastily added laughing. "But
the other fellows were ignorant peasants. They had to be taught
how to behave before they could expect to get jobs in
America."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>For awhile he was uneasy, evidently fearing that he had given
too much away. But my mistress's bland and careless manner
gradually restored his confidence. She applied judicious flattery
again, and made no further attempt to get anything out of
him.</p>

<p>When he left, he put his heels together, and bowing low from
the waist, kissed her hand in the best Continental manner. It was
charming Mme. Storey invited him to come to her house on the
following night. There is nothing like striking while the iron is
hot.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="first">He did not come to Mme. Storey's house. In fact
we never saw him again. That handsome and too-talkative young man
simply vanished.</p>

<p>On the following day another man replaced him in the rôle of
John Jerrold's clerk. This one was obviously no more or less than
a lawyer's clerk; a dull, plodding fellow, with no pretensions to
gallantry. He does not figure in the story in any way.</p>

<p>We had already set on foot cautious inquiries among Jerrold's
employees, and we learned that d'Escobar had simply not turned up
for business the day before, and that nobody in the office knew
where he was. Jerrold had given it out that he knew nothing about
the young man's movements outside office hours, and was not
sufficiently interested to inquire. From the same source we
obtained d'Escobar's last address.</p>

<p>In company with Inspector Rumsey and myself, Mme. Storey
immediately proceeded there. It was an old-fashioned walk-up
apartment house on 104th street, which had been sub-divided into
small suites, which were let furnished by the week. A thoroughly
respectable house with no pretences to style. In such a house the
tenants come and go with great frequency; d'Escobar had not been
established there more than a fortnight, but his uncommon good
looks had fixed him in the minds of the employees. They called
him "the handsome Dago."</p>

<p>From the negro telephone boy we got a fairly straight story.
This was a Friday. On Wednesday evening, the boy said, that would
be the evening of the day on which d'Escobar had tea at our
office, the young Spaniard was called down to the telephone about
eight o'clock. There were no extension 'phones in the building.
The negro was standing beside him while he talked over the
'phone. It was very brief. Somebody must have told him he was
wanted somewhere, for d'Escobar had said: "Is anything the
matter?" He had apparently received a reassuring answer. He had
then said: "All right, I'll come right away." The other person
then said something, to which d'Escobar replied: "Very well, I'll
be careful." He then hung up.</p>

<p>He asked the telephone boy to get him a taxi, and went up to
his flat for his hat and coat. His flat was the second floor
front, West. A taxi had been procured from a garage in 107th
street. It would be easy to find the man who drove it. D'Escobar
had never returned. They knew that because the maid had reported
his bed had not been slept in. He had carried no bag, nor
anything at all in his hand when he went.</p>

<p>While Inspector Rumsey went to look up the chauffeur Mme.
Storey and I were let into the flat. It was the usual thing,
parlour, bedroom and bath, furnished in a cheap style, but
comfortable enough. The most curious thing about it was, that the
youth who lived there apparently had no personal belongings, no
photographs, no knick-knacks, nothing but some packets of
cigarettes and a couple of dog-eared paper-covered novels in
Spanish, with lurid pictures on the covers. And his clothes, of
course; he had plenty of those; and fine ones, too; all neatly
put away en hangers it the wardrobe.</p>

<p>The place was in apple-pie order, but Mme. Storey's sharp eyes
presently discovered evidence that it had been ransacked since
the owner left. The lock of d'Escobar's trunk had recently been
forced; the marks of the break were fresh. The contents of the
bureau drawers were tumbled in a way that was incompatible with
the orderliness of everything else. Of the coats hanging in the
wardrobe, some of the fronts had been carelessly turned back, as
by somebody hastily feeling for the breast-pockets. There was a
little desk by the front windows, and a clean sweep had been made
of that. Even the desk blotter had been carried away, as if in
fear that it might reveal some tell-tale line of writing in a
mirror. The negro boy, who had frequently been in the room,
insisted that there had been a blotter on the desk two days
before.</p>

<p>"Has any person visited these rooms to-day or yesterday?" Mme.
Storey asked him.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, Madam."</p>

<p>"But you would know if anybody had been here?"</p>

<p>"All kinds of strangers come in and out the house, Madam. I
don't question them if they seem to know where they're
going."</p>

<p>"Has any other boy been on duty in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Yes 'm, I got a relief."</p>

<p>"This room is right over where you sit. If anybody had entered
these rooms while you were on duty, you must have heard
them."</p>

<p>"Yes 'm. I reckon so."</p>

<p>"Have you seen a good-looking young foreign man passing in or
out of the house to-day or yesterday?"</p>

<p>"No, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"You would have taken note of such a one as that?"</p>

<p>"Yes 'm. I sure would."</p>

<p>The other boy having been sent for, he returned the same
answers.</p>

<p>Finally Mme. Storey asked: "What time is the house
closed?"</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock, Madam. The switchboard is closed, and the
outer door locked."</p>

<p>"Every tenant has a key to the outer door, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes 'm. Every tenant gets two sets of keys when he moves
in."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey pointed to three keys on a string, which were
hanging inside the entrance door to the flat. "There is one set,"
she said. "Therefore, the person who ransacked this flat must
have had d'Escobar's keys." She turned away to the window.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I think," she answered in a grave, low tone, "that our young
friend has paid for his indiscretions to me, with his life."</p>

<p>I turned a little sick with horror. Another murder! "Oh!" I
breathed. At that moment I could think only of the young man's
beauty.</p>

<p>She looked at me queerly. "I can't feel very sorry for him,
Bella," she said quite coolly. "This is a case of my country
first. I don't care how many of these scoundrelly young
foreigners bite the dust if I am enabled to break up the
traffic!"</p>

<p>I stared at her in amazement. At the moment I was not yet able
to grasp the thing in its entirety.</p>

<p>Inspector Rumsey came in. He had got hold of the taxi-cab
driver, who had told him that d'Escobar had ordered him to drive
to the Metropolitan Building at Madison Avenue. The driver was
interested in his fare because, he said, the handsome young
foreigner reminded him of &mdash;&mdash;(He named a famous Motion
Picture star). And that seemed a funny address to give after
business hours. So after he had set d'Escobar down, he drove on a
little way, and stopped to watch him. It appeared that d'Escobar
was only waiting for another taxi. He hailed the first one that
came along, and was driven past the waiting car without noticing
it. The chauffeur's curiosity was now highly excited, and he went
to the trouble of taking down the number of the second taxi. He
had furnished it to Inspector Rumsey.</p>

<p>There was nothing further to be learned at the Hundred-and-Fourth street house, and we separated in our several directions
for dinner. At eight o'clock we came together again at Mme.
Storey's house. Inspector Rumsey had brought along the second
taxi-driver, and his car was at the door. This man had a clear
recollection of his foreign-looking fare of two nights before. He
had driven d'Escobar to the corner of Pleasant Avenue and a
street in the Seventies. Pleasant Avenue is on the far East side.
It corresponds to Avenue D farther down town.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey suggested that we follow forthwith. She dressed
herself in an inconspicuous coat and hat, and we set forth in the
taxi. We found that Pleasant Avenue had been named without any
regard to the fitness of things. It was a wide, raw,
miscellaneous kind of thoroughfare on the edge of the Island. It
was paved with granite blocks. At the point where we got out of
the taxi, the roadway was torn up for repair, and farther
progress was blocked by a barrier. This driver's curiosity had
not been excited by his fare, and he could give us no information
as to what had become of him when he stepped out of the cab.</p>

<p>Telling the man to wait, we walked on up the street at a
venture. This out-of-the-way avenue was well lighted, but was
sparsely frequented after nightfall. A little way along we came
to a great pile of granite blocks alongside the sidewalk. On the
walk an old man was seated in a kitchen chair tipped back against
the stones. His feet were cocked up on a rung of the chair, his
derby was pulled over his eyes, and he was smoking a disreputable
cutty pipe with evident enjoyment. Beside him on the pavement
stood a watchman's lantern.</p>

<p>"He was probably sitting there two nights ago," murmured Mme.
Storey. "Let us ask him."</p>

<p>The old man betrayed no sign of being aware of our approach,
but as soon as he was spoken to, we realised that he had been
watching us.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"'Even', mum." He looked up at her sharply, but did not
otherwise move. He was too old to be polite.</p>

<p>"Is it your job to watch these stones all night?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"So it would seem, mum."</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't think anybody would steal paving stones!"</p>

<p>This evidently touched a sore point.</p>

<p>"They'd steal anythin', mum," he said indignantly. "It ain't
but two nights ago since two of these very blocks was pinched.
They was missed in the morning because the pile was piled
regular. I caught hell for it."</p>

<p>Now all three of us were thinking about two nights ago, and
this simple fact seemed therefore as if it might have some
significance for us.</p>

<p>"What on earth would the thief want of them!" said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"You kin search me, mum. No good purpose, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"No good purpose," she agreed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>I shivered.</p>

<p>"You see that taxi-cab standing there?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Well, I still got my eyesight, mum."</p>

<p>"Did you see a taxi-cab stop in the same spot two nights ago,
just at this time or a few minutes later?"</p>

<p>"Meanin' no disrespec', but what is that to you, mum?"</p>

<p>Turning back his coat, Inspector Rumsey exhibited the police
badge. The old man's chair came to the pavement with a thump. He
stood up, and pulled off the battered derby. "Excuse me, Captain.
And you, mum. But how was I to know?...Yes, I see'd a taxi stop
there two nights ago this time. They ain't common in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Did you see a man get out?"</p>

<p>"Yes 'm."</p>

<p>"What sort of man?"</p>

<p>"Handsome young foreign gent. Dressed real elegant."</p>

<p>"That is the man. Did you see where he went?"</p>

<p>"Sure, mum. I ain't got much to occupy myself. I watches every
little thing. This young foreign gent. came right up here, and
walked on up the avenue to the corner of Seventy-__ street. Then
he turned down towards the river."</p>

<p>"Did you see him come back?"</p>

<p>"No 'm. He never come this way again."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey gave him a tip, and we left him bowing and tipping
the ridiculous derby.</p>

<p>We turned down the street the watchman had indicated. It was
no more than a half block to the river. The end of the street was
closed by a low stone parapet, topped by an iron railing. Looking
through the bars, you beheld the East River was some forty or
fifty feet below you, heaving silently and restlessly, showing a
furtive gleam under the night sky. On the other side lay
Blackwell's Island with its forbidding institutional buildings,
already darkened for the night. Beyond that again, the other
channel of the river, and the sparkling lights of the Long Island
shore.</p>

<p>When my mistress and I looked at the last house on the South
side of the street, I think we both knew what to expect. It was a
five-storey, double fiat-house of the style that was erected in
such numbers twenty-five years ago and more; a fifteen family
house; every New Yorker knows them. It is the type which
intervenes between the villainous old "dumb-bell" tenement, and
the "new-law" house. On the river side it fairly overhung the
cliff, being supported on a tall retaining wall with buttresses.
Looking down we could see the rocks at the foot of the cliff.
These would be partly covered when the tide rose.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I exchanged a look. By what a strange chain of
circumstances we had been led to the very house we wished to
find!</p>

<p>Seeing us look at each other, Inspector Rumsey asked if we
knew the house.</p>

<p>"It is the house which has been described to us as containing
the headquarters of the gang," said Mme. Storey. "The ground
floor flat on the river side."</p>

<p>The front windows of that flat were dark. We could not see, of
course, if there was any light in the rear. We knew the plan of
that flat just as well as if we had been in it. On the ground
floor the usual "private hall" of each flat is cut off by the
entrance hall, and the rooms open out of each other in a string,
sitting-room, one or two narrow bedrooms, dining-room and kitchen
On the other side of the entrance, there would be an exactly
similar flat, and in the rear of the building a four or five room
flat arranged in the form of a square.</p>

<p>My mistress was peering around. By this time I was able to
follow her thought.</p>

<p>"However could they get down to the rocks?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What would they want to get down there for?" asked Rumsey
innocently.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey pointed to a narrow opening at the end of the
parapet, across the road from the flat-house. Here we found a
rough, wooden stairway leading down to a ramshackle structure
near the water's edge. There was a little makeshift landing
there, it was evidently a sort of bathing establishment for the
neighbourhood. We saw that from the foot of the steps one could
easily make one's way back over the rocks to a point under the
windows of the flat-house.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said to Inspector Rumsey: "I suggest that the
police come up the river in a launch to-night and grapple for a
body off those rocks. Let them show no lights, and work with the
greatest care in order to avoid attracting the attention of
anybody in the flat. If a body should be found, let the fact be
concealed until we can consult together."</p>

<p>"But a strong tide runs up and down here," objected the
Inspector. "A body thrown in here might be found miles away."</p>

<p>"Not if it was weighted down with two granite blocks," said
Mme. Storey gravely.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="first">That night the body of Pedro d'Escobar was
fished up from the bottom of the East River. It was found tied to
a heavy canvas bag which contained the two paving stones. He had
been garrotted. The body was carried to a private undertaking
establishment, and for the time being no word of the gruesome
find was allowed to reach the press. Inspector Rumsey wanted to
raid the flat where the murder had certainly been committed, but
Mme. Storey shook her head.</p>

<p>"You would not find the principal there," she said, "and he's
the only one who matters. If either of us makes the slightest
false move he will escape us."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see that the occupants are kept under
surveillance," said Rumsey.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey still objected. "If any strange man were to appear
in that quiet street, no matter if he were the cleverest sleuth
on your staff, they would be sure to take alarm. Leave them to
me. I will watch them myself."</p>

<p>Rumsey has unbounded confidence in my mistress&mdash;he has
good reason for it; but he looked at her dubiously. "How could
you...in such a neighbourhood," he began.</p>

<p>"You'll see," she said, smiling. "I'll keep in touch with
you."</p>

<p>From that point on, Mme. Storey gave no direct attention to
the murder of Arpad Rody. We would gradually approach that, she
said, by way of the killing of the other handsome young
foreigner. I could perceive the general outline of her theory,
but I was still in a fog as to the actual connection between the
two crimes.</p>

<p>We left the Harker case to be threshed out in the newspapers;
and day by day they continued to make the most of it. To be sure,
after the sensational disclosures of the first day, the result of
their labours was mostly chaff; but it seemed to make little
difference to the public; they subscribed for it just as eagerly.
Two great parties were formed amongst the public; those who
thought Van Sicklen Harker had fired the fatal shot; and those
who ascribed it to Cornelia. Feeling ran high, and the newspapers
were bombarded with letters. Both parties, however, were able to
unite in idolising little Cornelia.</p>

<p>The "news" consisted almost exclusively of the successive
efforts of the various persons connected with the case to break
into the headlines. I remember that Algernon Bleecker succeeded
in holding the centre of the stage for an entire day by getting
himself ejected from the District-Attorney's office. I suppose he
had made an intolerable nuisance of himself there, by reason of
his self-imposed activities on behalf of the Harkers. The
unfortunate District-Attorney had a hard row to hoe anyhow. He
was the villain of the piece. He had to prosecute the public
idol.</p>

<p>In the absence of any real news, the daily interview with
Cornelia was the leading feature. Once a day in the prison,
Cornelia held a levee for the gentlemen and ladies of the press.
It was really rather scandalous; but the tide of popular interest
in the case was simply not to be resisted. Every day, for my
sins, I had to wade through many columns of the nonsense thus
produced, in order to make sure that nothing of significance
escaped Mme. Storey's attention.</p>

<p>The only time I was ever rewarded for my patience was upon
stumbling on this paragraph in one of the more intelligent
papers:</p>

<p>"The interview (with Cornelia) is limited to one hour. Every
day between fifty and sixty newspaper men and women attend. In
addition to the local press, every leading newspaper in the
country has assigned a special writer to the case. As it would be
impossible within this brief period of time for so many people to
question Miss Harker, it became necessary for them to elect one
of their number to talk to her. Miss Harker herself was invited
to nominate the interlocutor, and her choice fell upon Mr. Albert
Fleury of the <i>New York Universe.</i> Mr. Fleury is probably
the youngest reporter on the case, and certainly the newest
recruit to newspaperdom. His article yesterday on 'The Ideals of
Cornelia Harker' was especially pleasing to that young lady. She
held a clipping of it in her hand during the interview to-day.
Mr. Fleury is a Belgian. He is an exceedingly personable young
man; and his elegant manners are the despair of the graduates of
Park Row."</p>

<p>When I showed this to Mme. Storey she said: "What,
another!...Have you seen his articles?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "They attracted my attention because they were
even more fulsome than the general run."</p>

<p>"Hm!" she said; and reached for the telephone, to call up
Morrow, managing editor of the <i>Universe,</i> who was an
acquaintance of hers.</p>

<p>Morrow said the young man had been recommended to him by
Sterner, a vice-president of the Corlears Trust; the banker said
he had brought a letter of introduction from the president of the
Union Leather Company, one of their largest customers; the
leather manufacturer said he had him from John Jerrold the well-known lawyer.</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mme. Storey again.</p>

<p>She did not call up John Jerrold.</p>

<p>"Bella," she said, "I will write a meaningless letter to
Cornelia, which will nevertheless sound important. You carry it
down to her, taking care to deliver it while the reception to the
press is going on. Then you can have a look at this young
man."</p>

<p>This is the report that I brought back to my mistress:</p>

<p>"Albert Fleury is several years older than d'Escobar, and, I
should say a much warier and more astute young man. I think he
must have lived in America for a longer space of time, because he
is thoroughly on to our ways, and can speak English with scarcely
a trace of accent. But when he spoke to Cornelia I noticed that
he stuck on the French accent. Like d'Escobar, he is extremely
good-looking, but in an entirely different style, being tall,
blonde, with strongly chiselled aquiline features that give him a
bold look. When he speaks to Cornelia he allows a rapt look to
come into his eyes; and a hushed tone into his voice. She is
fascinated. The other reporters hate him; but he has firmly
entrenched himself in her favour, and he doesn't care. His eyes
are false and shallow; but she can't see that.</p>

<p>"During the few minutes that I was in the room, Fleury never
appeared to look at me. He was <i>too</i> indifferent. It
suggested to me that he was highly conscious of my presence; and
on fire to learn what had brought me. He has undoubtedly been
warned against us."</p>

<p>"Well, naturally," said Mme. Storey. "After what has
happened."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="first">During the early part of my association with
Mme. Storey, I was solely the secretary and office-manager; there
was never any question of my doing work in the field. Then in the
Melanie Soupert affair, circumstances forced me to play the part
of Canada Annie, and it was considered that I acquitted myself
quite well. Since then I have been compelled to adopt a disguise
on several occasions. Women operatives of the exact type that we
require are very hard to find. And I have the sort of ordinary
face that does not unduly impress itself on the memory. To be
sure I have red hair, but that may be dyed black, or covered with
a wig.</p>

<p>A few hours after Inspector Rumsey brought us the news of the
recovery of d'Escobar's body, Mme. Storey and I might have been
seen drifting up the sidewalk of Pleasant Avenue; but our closest
acquaintances would never have recognised us. Mme. Storey was
wearing a sandy wig, upon which was perched an old little black
bonnet; and her lovely complexion was made up to look coarsened
and spoiled. Her figure was stuffed out under a cotton dress, and
an old-fashioned, shabby black mantle. She was the good-natured
New York cleaning-woman to the life&mdash;of Irish extraction. It
was a treat to see how well she did the walk of a stout, middle-aged woman, still vigorous; coming down on the flat of her foot
with every step.</p>

<p>I was a thinner, paler, younger edition of the same; not so
good-humoured. My hair had been rendered drab and lifeless with
water colour; and was screwed into a hard knot. I was wearing a
bedraggled lace hat, and a ridiculous fawn-coloured jacket which
was inches too big in the bust, and cocked up like a sparrow's
tail behind. My skirt hung down behind in that dejected manner
which is peculiar to scrub-women. All these were genuine old
clothes; we made sure they were properly fumigated.</p>

<p>We walked a foot or two apart, talking so that anybody might
hear. Mme. Storey did most of the talking; she has the East Side
jargon down pat, whereas I have to think what I am saying. She is
richly humorous at such moments. It is her custom when we make
these excursions into the lower world, to introduce me as a
superior person, "who reads books." Her theory is, the more
fantastic the part, the easier it is to get away with it. You can
get away with anything, she says, so long as you can contrive not
to look self-conscious.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey also possesses to a high degree the faculty of
being able to enter into conversation with strangers. She paused
to talk to a woman, loitering on one of the stoops. We were in
search of a couple of nice cheap rooms, she announced. The woman
hunted up the janitor, who showed us a hole into which the light
of day scarce penetrated. Mme. Storey rejected it as being too
dear.</p>

<p>"Aah! you won't find nottin' cheaper on t' Avenoo," the man
said disgustedly. "You bett'r try t' side streets."</p>

<p>We turned into Seventy-__ Street. As I have said before, there
was only about a hundred yards of it between Pleasant Avenue and
the edge of the cliff. On the south side the flat-house at the
corner ran back for a hundred feet; then there was another flat;
then several nondescript wooden shanties; and finally the house
overhanging the cliff. On the other side of the way, most of the
space was taken up by a yard for the storage of wagons at night.
On this side overlooking the river was a picturesque, old-fashioned wooden dwelling which was still fairly well kept
up.</p>

<p>We went boldly into the house that we were interested in, to
ask for rooms. It appeared that there were no vacancies. I looked
with a little inward shiver at the partition which cut off the
murder flat, wondering what was going on within at that moment.
This flat had two doors opening on the long entrance hall of the
house; one just inside the front door, which would lead into
their parlour; the other farther back, which would be their usual
entrance, and would admit you to their dining-room.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road, adjoining the entrance to the
wagon yard, there was a little building which had once been a
store, but now housed one of the quaint little manufactories,
which are to be found everywhere in New York. Horse medicines
were put up here. There were two windows over the store, which
attracted Mme. Storey's notice. With a jerk of the head to me,
she headed across. Through the open door of the store came a
strong smell of condition powders. A boy was engaged in breaking
eggs into a small vat. His expression suggested that the eggs
were not very fresh. He was the sole employee.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey beckoned the proprietor to the door. He was a
tall, lanky horse-doctor; a genuine American type, such as is
rare in New York. He looked like an original New Yorker,
embittered by finding himself in a city of foreigners.</p>

<p>"What's upstairs, Mister?" asked Mme. Storey genially.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" he answered sourly.</p>

<p>"Well, bein' as t' windas was so dusty, like, I t'ought maybe
t' rooms was vacant and..."</p>

<p>"They are vacant," he said. "I give up tryin' to rent 'em,
because decent folk won't live in such a place, and I don't want
no riff-raff."</p>

<p>"Riff-raff!" cried Mme. Storey, planting her arms akimbo.
"<i>Riff-raff!</i> I'd have you to know, Mister, that me and my
sister here don't answer to no such description. Poor we may be
but..."</p>

<p>"Aah, keep yer hair on," he said disgustedly. "I wasn't
gettin' at you...There's no conveniences. You'd have to come down
to the yard for water."</p>

<p>"Well, I could stand that if it was cheap enough," said Mme.
Storey. "Me an me sister, we ain't got no man to provide for
us..."</p>

<p>"Any children?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Divil a chick!" she said, beaming.</p>

<p>He finally condescended to show us the rooms; and after a
spinted bargaining, an agreement was struck at $3.15 per week.
The first week's rent was paid over on the spot. The landlord's
parting shot as he went out of the door was:</p>

<p>"Mind you, if you've got a passel of brats waitin' round the
corner, out you'll go next week! I know you Irish!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I rocked in silent laughter.</p>

<p>To reach our new quarters, you mounted an outside stairway
from the wagon yard. It was not a very inviting place; it had
been given up to the dust ad the rats for many a month, years
maybe; and it was pervaded by a strong smell of horse liniment.
But that didn't matter so much since we had no intention either
of eating or sleeping there. We congratulated ourselves on
obtaining so good a point of vantage. We were not immediately
opposite the house overhanging the cliff; but everybody who
entered or left it, passed our windows.</p>

<p>From a second-hand store in Pleasant Avenue we purchased for
camouflage, cots, chairs, a table, some pots and pans and a cook
stove.</p>

<p>There was a teamster's family living in a shanty at the back
of the wagon yard, and the wife, who could see nothing from her
own windows, seemed to spend the time standing at the gate yard.
Within an hour, Mme. Storey had struck up a great friendship with
her. She proved an invaluable source of information. She missed
nothing that passed in our street; moreover, she was the intimate
friend of the wife of the janitor across the way.</p>

<p>The particular flat which we were watching, had aroused
considerable interest in the street, owing to the invariable
comeliness of the young men who lodged there. "They may be Wops
or Huns or Dagoes or whatnot, mum, but they're always pretty
fellows," said our informant. "It seems funny." The house keeper
was known as the French Madam. Before the afternoon was out, the
teamster's wife was able to point her out to us, returning with
her purchases from the store. We saw an enormous shapeless figure
swathed in black, moving slowly along under the burden of her
fat, looking from side to side with sullen pained eyes. Her face
showed the remnants of a rather remarkable beauty, ruined by fat
and evil living. It was a tragic and a sinister figure.</p>

<p>Thereafter, during the hours of daylight, one or another of us
was always on duty in the rooms over the horse medicine shop. We
cemented our friendship with the wife of the teamster. That
honest woman brewed her own beer in the shack at the back of the
wagon yard. It was a vile decoction; but it was the occasion of
friendly little gatherings every morning, which enabled us to
meet Mrs. Regan, the wife of the janitor across the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. Regan didn't like the French Madam. "Aah! the big fat
slob!" she said, blowing the froth off her beer. "I'd like to
paste her one!"</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Aah, she ain't just human, like. Not like you and me. Looks
at you like you was dirt!"</p>

<p>It reassured us to learn that the French Madam had just paid a
month's rent in advance. Evidently they had no intention at the
moment of giving us the slip. At this time she had only two
lodgers, whom Mrs. Regan described to us as a dago and a little
Frenchy. The dago was a bad egg, she said; once he had kicked her
cat clear of the sidewalk just for getting in his way. But
Frenchy was a nice little feller. He looked real sorrowful at
being in such company. She could even supply their names.
According to her the dago was called Hot-Willy Oh-come-all-ye;
and Frenchy Denny the Cash-boy.</p>

<p>When we were alone I asked Mme. Storey what she could make of
these extraordinary appellations.</p>

<p>She answered without hesitation: "Attilio Camagli and Denis de
Cachebois."</p>

<p>We had no difficulty in identifying our men. They were sent
out every afternoon for an aimless walk. These were the
neophytes; they were still shabbily dressed. Apparently there was
no love lost between them, for they always separated on the
doorstep. The French boy would turn aside and remain staring at
the river through the bars of the railing until the Italian had
walked off out of sight. This French lad was as pretty as a girl.
He was evidently of the Northern provinces, with tight blonde
curls all over his head, and big blue eyes which were at once
saddened, and secretly terrified. What had those eyes beheld, I
wondered. As soon as she saw him, Mme. Storey said:</p>

<p>"They slipped up when they picked him. He's already cracking
under the strain."</p>

<p>The Italian on the other hand was a big, stalwart fellow,
black as the Knave of Spades. He was undeniably good-looking; but
with the good looks of a brigand. His full, red lips were curved
in a perpetual sneer; He looked at women through his lowered
sooty eyelashes with an expression of insolent triumph.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" said I, "surely no gently brought-up girl
would ever fall for him!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Mme. Storey, "if they can give him a
slight veneer of good manners, that sort of man is irresistible
to inexperienced girls."</p>

<p>On the second day after we had installed ourselves in our
rooms, we arranged it so that we ran into the French boy in
Pleasant Avenue, as he was listlessly drifting home. Mme. Storey
addressed him in French. The effect was electrical; he stopped
short, his cheeks coloured up, his eyes glistened. He answered
her in a perfect torrent of his own tongue.</p>

<p>I do not know the language myself, but Mme. Storey speaks it
like a native; and I am continually listening to her. She was not
speaking good French now, but a sort of jargon, However, he
understood it well enough. It was pathetic to see how the boy's
whole nature went out to her. They talked a little while then
suddenly he choked up, and the blue eyes filled. He put his head
down, and fairly ran away.</p>

<p>"That kid is worth saving," murmured my mistress. "How on
earth did you account to him for your ability to speak French?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I told him I was a hospital cook in France during the
war," she said shrugging.</p>

<p>"What made him cry?"</p>

<p>"I spoke to him of his own country."</p>

<p>On a subsequent afternoon when I went to the rooms on Seventy-__ Street to relieve Mme. Storey, I found little Denis there. I
could hear his eager, rapid voice as I went up the outside stair.
It still held a suggestion of the reedy tones of boyhood. He
stopped abruptly when I went in. Evidently, from his face, the
tears had been falling again. My presence embarrassed him very
much, and he soon left. When the door closed behind him, I looked
at my mistress inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was very discreet," she said, reaching for a
cigarette. When we were alone in the flat, the contrast between
Mme. Storey's absurd make-up and the natural elegance of all her
movements, created a very strange effect indeed. She was like
some delightful, incredible figure out of a dream. "The fate of
d'Escobar is still fresh in his mind," she went on. "He confined
himself to talking about La Belle France."</p>

<p>On the following afternoon I ran into Denis loitering
unhappily along the pavement of Pleasant Avenue. He gave me a
piteous look, and glanced in terror over his shoulder. Clearly he
wished to speak to me, and was afraid to do so. Close beside me
there was a fruit and vegetable display on the sidewalk, and in
order to give him a chance, I paused, and affected to look over
it.</p>

<p>He drifted up to my side, and likewise scanned the vegetables
in the manner of an intending purchaser.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his mouth he murmured in his charming
broken English: "Please...not to look at me Miss. Please...to
tell your sister I can't come no more. Please...I thank her from
my heart for the kindness to a French boy. Please...if we meet on
the street do not notice me at all. It is very dangerous."</p>

<p>With that he was gone.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="first">Mme. Storey had seen the janitor's wife enter
the wagon-yard below, and before knocking off for the day, my
mistress went to pay a call at the teamster's shanty to see if
anything new was to be picked up. Meanwhile I sat down to my
vigil at the window. We had taken care not to wash the windows,
and the accumulated grime offered a very good screen for any one
watching from within.</p>

<p>I saw Dennis return home from his empty wanderings about the
streets. He was followed shortly afterwards by Camagli, the
Italian lad, whose cruel, complacent, half-sleepy expression
suggested a gorged cat-animal. He had been up to some mischief I
could have sworn. This would be about half-past three.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I saw coming at a smart pace from the
direction of Pleasant Avenue, a man I had never seen before, but
I instantly guessed that he was connected with our case. Like all
the others, he too, was a pretty fellow, but a few years older
than those we had been dealing with, and completely Americanised.
He was foreign born, but his foreign expression was gone. Hat,
coat, boots, gloves all suggested Madison Avenue. He was just
such a figure as you may pick out between Forty-Second and Forty-Seventh any day in the year. He had a grace of feature and of
figure that filled me with helpless anger, because you could see
with half an eye that he was perfectly worthless. Physical beauty
has us all at such a disadvantage! He had a look of arrogant
authority, a trick that is very easily learned&mdash;especially
if your pockets are well-lined. Young as he was, his face was
beginning to be marked by dissipation. One of his eyebrows was
cocked a little higher than the other, which made him look as
attractive as the devil, and bad clear through.</p>

<p>He disappeared within the flat house across the way. I was
filled with excitement. Would this be the leader, the directing
spirit, the master mind, that Mme. Storey was so keen about
laying her hands on? Somehow I doubted that; there was no power
in that handsome face. More likely a successful graduate of the
academy. I was in a horrid state of indecision whether to stay at
the window or go warn my mistress.</p>

<p>I remained where I was; and it was well that I did so; for
almost immediately all three young men issued out of the house
together. He with the lifted eye-brow walked in the middle with
Denis and Attilio on either hand. The neophytes were regarding
the finished product with respect, not to say awe. The three of
them set off briskly for Pleasant Avenue.</p>

<p>It was of the highest importance to find out where they were
going if I could. Snatching up my things, I slipped down the
stairway, and out through the gate of the wagon-yard. There was
no time to warn Mme. Storey then. I was close behind my three
men, but on the other side of the street. I could not cross over,
of course, nor appear to be hurrying unduly. From where I was I
brought to bear on them whatever powers of observation my
mistress has succeeded in fostering in me.</p>

<p>The man with the lifted eye-brow was talking animatedly to the
two youngsters, but in low tones, for they held their heads close
to hear. Since they were of different races, I judged he would be
speaking in English; but alas! there was no chance of my
overhearing a word! He was evidently instructing them; they
listened like children. Fortunately for me, he had retained
something of the foreign habit of gesticulation.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment, he leaned over and drew the back of his
hand down the seam of his trouser leg, the other two following
him with eager attention. Next he threw back the lapels of his
coat, and pointed to his waist line. Pausing again, he made
Attilio stand back a step, and gazing at him through half-closed
eyes, drew his spread hand down through the air, like a painter
visualising picture. Little Denis he dismissed with a curt
gesture.</p>

<p>At the corner they turned down town. I was now half a block
behind them, and the people in front of the shops obstructed my
view. To my great disappointment I saw that there was a taxi-cab
waiting below the barrier where the street improvements began.
They got into it, and were driven away. There was no other taxi
to be had in that part of town. I had to let them go.</p>

<p>When I returned to our rooms I found Mme. Storey there,
somewhat surprised at my absence. I described to her exactly what
I had seen. She smiled to herself. She waved aside my regrets at
having been prevented from following the young men farther.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," she said. "It is obvious where they have
gone."</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked like a child.</p>

<p>"He is taking them to the tailors' to be measured for their
new clothes."</p>

<p>"Why of course!"</p>

<p>"Say half an hour to go," she said computing to herself; "an
hour to be measured; another half an hour to return. Now if
Madame la Countesse will only go out as usual at this hour to do
her shopping..."</p>

<p>"There she is," I said, pointing to where the woman was at
that moment turning sideways, to lower her huge bulk carefully
down the steps of the flathouse. "But why?"</p>

<p>"I am going over to have a look at that flat," she said.</p>

<p>My heart sunk like a stone.</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" I groaned. "Think of the danger!"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "The principal danger is that they take alarm
too soon," she said. "I must chance that. As for myself, well, I
have this."</p>

<p>From the battered little bag that she carried as part of her
present make-up, she took an automatic pistol, and slipped it
inside the stuffed out bodice of her dress. The sight of the
ugly, black weapon made me feel a little sick.</p>

<p>"How will you get in?" I cried. "Have you got a key?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "When we were in the hall of that house I
took note of the lock on the door. Old-fashioned spring lock.
Child's play to open, as many a sneak-thief in New York has
discovered to his profit. This is the tool he uses. I've been
keeping it in readiness."</p>

<p>From the bag again, she produced a small rectangular piece of
steel so thin and lissom that it could be bent over until the
ends touched.</p>

<p>Now I am no heroine, as those of you have read these stories
must know by this time. Whenever a situation like this arises, my
heart simply turns to water, and I would give a million dollars
to be safe out of it. At the same time there are certain things
that, afraid or not, one is forced to do.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're going, I'm going too," I said in a very
disagreeable voice.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey laughed, and gave me an affectionate glance.
"There is no need of it, my Bella, really."</p>

<p>"You will have to examine into everything," I said. "You need
me to stand watch in case they return."</p>

<p>"I can trust my ears for that," she said. "There are two
entrances to the flat."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you say," I said. "I'm coming."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said coolly. "Come ahead."</p>

<p>We stood at the gate of the wagon-yard until Madame in her
snail-like progress had turned the corner of Pleasant Avenue.
Then across the street, and into the flat house. The entrance
door was never locked during the day. My poor heart was beating
like a trip-hammer. Some day I shall have heart failure at such a
moment, and disgrace myself eternally. Proceeding down the narrow
hall, Mme. Storey rapped on the door which led into the dining-room of the flat we meant to enter.</p>

<p>"This is the proper procedure," she whispered to me, grinning.
"A sneak-thief always knocks first."</p>

<p>I was in no condition to answer her grin. I stood between her
and the entrance door in case anybody should enter or leave. I
was straining my ears for sounds from the flat opposite. One of
our greatest dangers was that the door immediately behind us
might be opened at that moment.</p>

<p>The doors of these cheaply-built houses are always ill-fitting. That's what the sneak-thief counts on. While I made a
shield for her with my body, Mme. Storey inserted her wafer of
steel opposite the keyhole of the spring lock, and worked it in,
pressing the lock back. In a few seconds we were inside. She
softly closed the door.</p>

<p>Shaking like a person in an ague, at first I could see
nothing.</p>

<p>"Take heart, Bella," she said cheerfully. "Remember, we have
only to run out into the street to be safe."</p>

<p>The extremity of my fear passed, and I looked around me with a
growing curiosity. I was astonished, I remember, to find the
place so orderly. One thinks of abandoned criminals as living in
filth and squalor; but this flat, while it contained nothing but
the barest necessities, was a model of neatness and
cleanliness.</p>

<p>"That's the French of it," remarked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>There was a table covered with a red and white checked cloth,
and half a dozen cheap wooden chairs standing about. Another
plain deal table served them for a sideboard. A sewing machine
under one of the two windows gave the room a homely touch. There
was also a much worn arm-chair standing with its back towards the
entrance to the bedroom. No pictures; no touches of ornament of
any sort, it was like the eating-room in a humble estaminet.</p>

<p>We looked into the kitchen at the rear. The same rigorous
neatness prevailed there. Nothing of interest to us in that room.
On the other side of the dining-room you entered the first
bedroom through an archway hung with a pair of shabby chenille
portieres. This was Madame's room. To obtain a little privacy,
she had hung cotton curtains around her bed in the French manner.
We found nothing in that room. Next came a short hallway
connecting the two bedrooms of the flat. The bathroom opened from
it. Nothing for us there.</p>

<p>The second bedroom was evidently shared by Denis and Attilio.
It had two cots. The moment we entered this room Mme Storey
pointed to a great hook which had been screwed into the top of
the window frame outside the sash. No comment was necessary. On
the floor of the wardrobe we found lying a coil of new rope, and
a pulley. Above the rope, amongst other clothes, hung the elegant
grey suit that d'Escobar had worn when he came to tea with Mme.
Storey. His hat was there also, and his shoes. In one of the
pockets of the coat within a twist of paper, we found the ring
with a turquoise scarab that I had seen upon his finger; also his
gold pencil and his tortoise-shell cigarette case of the latest
design.</p>

<p>"How methodical!" said Mme. Storey grimly.</p>

<p>From a drawer in the bottom of the wardrobe she presently took
a sinister little object. It was a circle of steel not much
thicker than a heavy wire. The ends were pulled together by a
long screw which turned with a handle.</p>

<p>"What is that?" I gasped, though in my heart I knew
already.</p>

<p>"One form of a garrotte," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Before my mind's eye I could see the devilish instrument
slowing drawing around the comely throat of that poor, foolish
d'Escobar who had talked too much. I covered my face with my
hands; but that didn't shut out the sight. Mme. Storey put the
thing back.</p>

<p>In front of this bedroom was still another room, which would
ordinarily serve as the parlour of the flat. But these people had
used it as an extra bedroom. It had a window looking on the
street. There were three cots placed about the walls; all neatly
covered with spreads, but having no bedding beneath. Obviously
this room was not being used at the present time. As I have
mentioned before, it had a door leading into the public hall of
the house. This door had a spring lock like the other one, also
the common lock that is in every door. The key was in this lock,
and it was turned. This fact afforded me no little comfort, as
showing that the occupants could not come in that way, and catch
us between two fires.</p>

<p>When Mme. Storey beheld the turned key she smiled to herself.
I did not then realise what was passing through her mind.</p>

<p>Our tour of the flat had consumed a good bit of time, and I
was getting horribly anxious about the possible return of the
occupants. My mistress, absorbed in her patient investigation,
was absolutely oblivious to the danger. I suggested that I had
better take up my stand behind the lace curtains at the front
windows; and she agreed. She went back into the rear of the flat;
and for another space of time I neither saw nor heard anything of
her. Finally I could bear it no longer. I softly called her
back.</p>

<p>"Our two hours is about up," I said. "We <i>must</i> go!"</p>

<p>She said: "I'm not going, Bella." She pointed to the turned
key. "I have a perfect line of retreat. The opportunity is too
good to be missed. I desire to overhear their talk."</p>

<p>A sort of despair seized me. It was useless to attempt to
argue with her. "Well, if you must, you must," I said. "I'll have
to stay too."</p>

<p>"There's no need of that," she said. "Why, you're terrified at
the mere idea."</p>

<p>"I know I am," I said crossly. "But if I had to sit there
across the road watching for you to come out that would be worse.
I couldn't stand that."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey being entirely unacquainted with fear, never
realises what I suffer at such moments.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," she said cheerfully. "Two watchers are better
than one."</p>

<p>In due course I saw the three young men approaching on the
sidewalk. As I could only see a few yards along the street,
without exposing myself, they were almost at the steps.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" I gasped.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked over my shoulder. "The third man is Raymo
Borghini," she said coolly. "One meets him everywhere. He married
Mildred Winterson, daughter of the basket-machine
millionaire."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="first">We remained in the front room, taking care to
unlock the door into the hall, and to catch back the spring lock,
in case we had to make a quick getaway. The three young men were
taking no pains to be quiet, and we could follow all their
movements. They came into the bedroom to hang up their hats and
coats. Ah! how my heart beat when one of them came to the very
door behind which I stood! They were talking in English. Clothes
was still the subject. I did not hear the voice of little
Denis.</p>

<p>They then returned to the dining-room. Mme. Storey stole
through the first bedroom, and the little hall into the second
bedroom, and I followed perforce. It was their habit to leave all
the doors open except the door into the front room; and this
saved us a lot of trouble. We were now separated from them only
by the portieres hanging in the archway. Thank God! in the actual
moment of danger there is something that comes to your support. I
was still afraid; but T had command of my faculties now.</p>

<p>It was growing dark out-of-doors, and they switched on the
light in the dining-room. We could hear every word they said; and
we could even catch glimpses of them as they moved back and forth
in front of the narrow interstice between the portieres. There
was a pause while matches were struck, and they drew deep at
cigarettes. Presently the aroma came wafting through the
portieres, and I heard a little sigh of desire escape my
mistress. For more than two hours she had been deprived of her
usual stimulus.</p>

<p>We had no difficulty in distinguishing between the various
voices. Camagli's was a rumbling bass; Borghini's, the
Americanised one, a smooth baritone with a sneer. We already knew
the sound of Denis's voice; but he rarely spoke. Camagli said
something in Italian, and Borghini quickly caught him up.</p>

<p>"Speak English! You've got to learn to think in English."</p>

<p>"One suit!" grumbled Camagli. "What good one suit!"</p>

<p>"I was only obeying instructions," said Borghini. "The Maestro
wants to see how you look in it, before he put any more money
into you. You're dumb, Attilio! My God! with your looks and
figure you ought to rise high. You've got everything&mdash;except
the trifling matter of brains."</p>

<p>"You order t'ree suit for Denis."</p>

<p>"Denis can wear clothes. It comes natural to him."</p>

<p>"Yah! Denis, he scare' of a shadow. He trembla if you
frown."</p>

<p>"Well, that's up to the Maestro. What I'm trying to do is to
lick you into shape...Walk across the room and back."</p>

<p>Camagli obeyed, presumably.</p>

<p>"Elbows in; chest out; head up," commanded Borghini. "Rise on
the ball of your foot."</p>

<p>"I am doing so," growled Camagli angrily.</p>

<p>"Sure, you are," said Borghini sarcastically, "just as if you
were pulled by strings! You've got to keep on doing it, too,
until you look as if you were born to it...Denis, show the mutt
how a European gentleman walks into the room."</p>

<p>"Show me, you," growled Camagli.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm an American now," laughed Borghini. "I can do as I
damn please. I've landed my fish!"</p>

<p>The crack of light that came between the portieres showed me
the look of set, cold anger on my mistress's face.</p>

<p>Denis illustrated as he was bid. At that moment Camagli was
standing close to the portieres with his back to us, and we heard
him mutter:</p>

<p>"By God! I'll kill the little&mdash;!" The epithet was in
Italian.</p>

<p>"That won't improve your style any," sneered Borghini.</p>

<p>Down the public hall outside, we heard approaching an
unmistakable, slow pad, pad, pad. Mme. Storey and I softly
retreated into the front room, closing the last door after us. We
heard the old "Countess" enter the dining-room, and address the
young men complainingly.</p>

<p>Her voice was as hoarse as a man's. She then entered her own
room. After a while we heard her go back and join in the
conversation. We waited a moment or two, then stole back to our
former post of observation.</p>

<p>She had seated herself in the shabby arm-chair, which, as I
have said, was a little to one side, and immediately in front of
the curtained archway. By peeping sideways through the crack
between the portieres I could just see the coil of greasy hair on
top of her head which was still as black as a raven's wing; also
one shapeless forearm, and puffy hand. She was busy with
something that I could not quite follow. I heard a click as of an
opening box; the hand appeared outstretched with a flicking
movement; then she sniffed loudly, and the box snapped shut. I
did not get it until in dumb-play, Mme. Storey illustrated to me
the act of taking snuff.</p>

<p>The old woman was sitting there, grumbling away in French. The
young men paid no attention to her. The lesson was still going
on. Borghini was making Camagli take a cigarette and go through
the motions of lighting it over and over. Borghini said:</p>

<p>"As soon as you do it right you can have the Spaniard's
tortoiseshell case for your own."</p>

<p>As he said that it happened that Denis was just in line with
my vision through the crack, and I saw an involuntary spasm of
horror pass over the white face. I shivered too.</p>

<p>The old woman, angered at being ignored, raised her voice, and
Borghini barked at her over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Aah! you know that Attilio and I can't speak your lingo. If
you want to be answered, speak English!"</p>

<p>She did not, however, repeat what she had been saying. She
took snuff again.</p>

<p>"Now come on," said Borghini, in the voice of a snappy college
coach; "make out that the Countess is a rich American dame who
has asked you to dinner. Come in from the kitchen, and pay your
respects."</p>

<p>Camagli proceeded to obey. As he crossed the dining-room
Borghini warned him:</p>

<p>"Mind! No matter how many people there are in the room, you
must keep your eyes on her!"</p>

<p>I could only see the end of this performance; that is, where
he bent from the waist to kiss the bloated hand that was extended
from the easy chair. I was astonished to see how well he did it.
He was probably only of peasant stock. He was no more than four
feet from me, and for the first time I realised how good looking
he was in his swarthy, insolent fashion. From a purely animal
standpoint, he was the handsomest of them all. I was appalled to
think of the harm he might work.</p>

<p>Borghini was not satisfied. "Denis, show him how," he
said.</p>

<p>If I thought Camagli did it well, when Denis did it I saw the
real thing. He kissed that unpleasant-looking paw with a
reverential air that was irresistible. He must have had good
blood. Certainly his father and his grandfather had been doing
that before him.</p>

<p>"You'll never be able to do it like that," said Borghini to
Camagli, "but you can keep on trying."</p>

<p>"Ah well, Denis, he is Franche," rumbled the old woman. "Dere
ees no lovairs anywhere lak de Franchmens."</p>

<p>Borghini made a coarse rejoinder that I need not repeat.
"Denis has style," he added, "but he's got no more spirit than a
louse."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said the Countess, taking snuff, "dere ees all
kin' reech girls, too. When le Maestro fin' nice, sof' gentle lil
girl, it will be Denis's turn."</p>

<p>Camagli was obliged to repeat the hand-kissing performance.
Borghini planted himself astride a chair with his arms resting on
the back, and exhorted them from the heights of his superior
experience.</p>

<p>"You fellows ought to be damned glad to work like hell for a
few months. It means a palace on Easy Street for the rest of your
lives. After you catch your bird you don't have to keep up this
foolishness. You can let yourself go. Never forget how lucky you
are that the Maestro's eye fell on you. He does all the real
brain work. Nothing is required from you but a little high-class
comedy. You can depend on the Maestro. He's no piker. Nothing
less than eight figures attracts him. Eight figures; do you get
it? And dollars at that. I couldn't do the sum in lire or francs.
Look at Albert Fleury. He's the lucky dog. Booked for Rody's
widow. But there are plenty of others.</p>

<p>"These girls get the bit between their teeth early. They've
already got the old man well broke before we come along. So
everything is right for us. They get the mon' out of the old man,
and we get it out of them, see? I can give you plenty of points
how to make your wife fork out. They take this hand kissing
business seriously; they think we're going to keep it up. Oh Gee!
it makes me laugh to think of the surprise that is waiting for
them. They don't understand us Europeans; they think we're soft-headed, and easy led by the nose like their own men. Whenever you
get sick of kissing their hands, remember, your time is coming.
Some of them have got spirit, of course. They'll kick you out.
But that's all right. You can make it cost them a hell of a good
price to get rid of you; and if there's been no public scandal,
the Maestro will put you on to something new.</p>

<p>"All you fellows have got to do is to stick to the Maestro.
He's a great man. Lie back on him; he'll run your show for you.
Could you ask more? But never, never allow yourselves to think
that you can get along without him. His arm can reach right
around the world. You saw what he did to d'Escobar last week. And
you know what happened to Arpad Rody a few days before that.
Rody, the poor fool, was so swollen up with having married the
Harker billions that he dared to hold out on the man who had
gotten it all for him. Well, pow! Rody got a bullet through the
brain, and that was the end of him...!"</p>

<p>I glanced at my mistress marvelling for the hundredth time at
the unerring intuition which guides her. Leaving police, public
and press to mill around in a futile circle unable to decide
whether Van Sicklen Harker or Cornelia had shot Arpad Rody, she
had struck off alone on the true course.</p>

<p>Borghini continued in the same vein, but furnished us with no
further information of first-rate importance. While he talked,
and Mme. Storey watched him with a stern set face, I saw her
unconsciously fingering the place in her bodice under which the
pistol lay. Involuntarily the thought had come into her mind that
was in my own: What a deed of righteousness it would be to shoot
down this conscienceless young scoundrel.</p>

<p>Finally Borghini resumed the lesson. He said to Camagli: "Make
out that Denis is the girl you have been told to take down to
dinner. Bring her to the table...Don't poke your elbow at her
like a gowk. Just have your arm ready in case she wants to take
it...Beside your plate you'll find four or five knives and as
many forks according to the number of courses that are to be
served. Leave them lay; that's all you got to do. They're fixed
especially for boobs like you. You can't go wrong if you take the
outside one each time. The littlest knife is the butter
spreader..."</p>

<p>At intervals throughout this scene, the old woman in front of
us had been taking snuff. Each time she helped herself to a
pinch, she flicked the surplus powder off her thumb nail on the
air. I was so absorbed in the scene, that the possible effect on
myself never occurred to me until I felt the sneeze coming
between my eyes.</p>

<p>Oh, Heaven! A sneeze is supposed to be a comic performance;
but I assure you that was the most dreadful moment in my whole
life! That sneeze came upon me as relentless as doom!</p>

<p>I turned and fled from the portieres. Mme. Storey must have
thought I was crazy. I got across the first room, and through the
little hall. In the second bedroom, as I reached for the handle
of the door into the parlour, it overtook me. I buried my face in
my arm, but the sneeze broke through with a roar. I have never
sneezed like that before or since.</p>

<p>In an instant Mme. Storey was at my side. We heard a chair
overturn in the dining-room, and the sound of running feet. We
got into the parlour. The door into the public hall was unlocked;
but it had not been opened for some time; and it stuck. Oh, the
agony of that moment! By the time we got it open, Camagli had run
through the public hall, and we found him facing us. He charged
blindly through the door, forcing us both back, and kicked the
door shut behind him. At the same moment I was struck over the
head from behind.</p>

<p>All the strength ran out of my limbs like water; and I sank to
the ground. I was not completely unconscious; for I was aware
that somebody had turned on the light. And I could still hear the
sounds of the struggle; but no cries, only a strident, furious
whispering. I heard one man gasp out: "Madame Storey!" I, myself,
was desperately striving to cry out, but I had no power over my
tongue. That nightmare horror of being unable to make a sound is
the last thing I remember. Everything turned black.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="first">I came drifting back to consciousness in the
same manner that I had drifted away. First I was merely aware of
<i>being;</i> then I heard a droning sound that resolved itself
into a murmur of voices; then I opened my eyes and beheld the
light. I found myself sitting in a chair. The first object that
resolved itself out of the general haze was the figure of Mme.
Storey seated in another chair beside me. Her eyes were fixed
upon me, big with concern. When they met my eyes they smiled
wonderfully; but she had a handkerchief over her mouth. For a
moment my poor, confused wits puzzled over that, then full
consciousness returned with a jerk.</p>

<p>It was an awakening to despair; for I perceived that my
mistress was tied to the back and to the legs of the chair in
which she sat; and the handkerchief was a gag. She had lost the
sandy wig and the little black bonnet, and her own shining dark
hair had shaken down about her head. Mme. Storey bound and
helpless! My world was in ruins. To be sure, I was in the same
condition; but that seemed to be a matter of small moment. That
one so glorious as she should be at the mercy of this scum of
humanity, was to me an outrage too great to be borne. Yet her
eyes were calm and clear; there was even a hint of amusement in
them.</p>

<p>I had the dreadful feeling that I was responsible for her
plight. Had she been alone, she could no doubt have escaped; but
she could not leave me behind. Somewhere in that populous house I
heard a door slam. How sharp the pain of the realisation that the
ordinary life of New York was going on all about us, while we lay
there helpless. In my agony of mind I groaned under the gag, and
strained at the ropes that bound me. Borghini cursed me under his
breath. I cared nothing for that; but Mme. Storey warned me with
her eyes to be silent; and I obeyed her.</p>

<p>The four members of the gang were sitting around one side of
the table, all facing us at a distance of ten or twelve feet. The
obese Frenchwoman was planted in her chair like a shapeless sack
of flesh. A bottle of cognac, and Mme. Storey's pistol lay on the
table before her. The three young men leaned across with their
heads close, whispering together, and darting furtive looks of
terror at Mme. Storey's proud head. However little Denis may have
been disposed towards us and towards them in the beginning,
terror had driven him back into their arms. He was one with them
now.</p>

<p>It was no satisfaction to me to see that they were terrified
of my mistress even bound as she was. They had caught more than
they bargained for; they were paralysed by the magnitude of the
situation; they did not know what to do. But I knew only too
well, that a frightened man is more dangerous than an angry one.
There lay the loaded pistol on the table; and how easy to solve
an impossible situation with a bullet! At any moment I expected
to see one of the men snatch it up. I gave up hope.</p>

<p>How terrible it was to <i>see</i> them discussing our fate,
and not to be able to follow the discussion. I knew they must be
talking English, for it was the only language common to the four
of them. At first all that was plain was that they could not
agree. Borghini argued in vain. He had lost his ascendancy over
Camagli. That man's furious brutality now showed forth without
disguise. And Denis in the extremity of his terror seemed to side
with him. The woman said little. She was the least afraid of the
quartette. She had more than one pull at the bottle, and her
drunken eyes fixed themselves on Mme. Storey, stupid with
hate.</p>

<p>Finally they began to quarrel, and their voices rose. "La
garrotte!" said the old woman in her hoarse, guttural voice.</p>

<p>"Denis, bring me la garrotte! It ees the only way!"</p>

<p>Denis, however, made no move.</p>

<p>"No, by God!" said Borghini, banging the table. (He evidently
wished us to hear this.) "I've kept clear of murder up to now,
and I've no desire to feel an electrode on the back of my
neck!"</p>

<p>"Yah!" snarled Camagli, threatening him with his fist. "I'll
kill you too! You t'ink you get out of it, eh? You t'ink you
leave us to pay!"</p>

<p>Borghini sprang up and away from the man. He was yellow with
fright.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he snarled, "if we get to fighting amongst
ourselves, she'll escape!"</p>

<p>"La garrotte!" repeated the old woman stupidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" cried Borghini. "She wouldn't have
ventured in without support. She may have twenty men concealed in
the street."</p>

<p>The woman shrugged ponderously.</p>

<p>"Then we hang any'ow," she said. "I keel her first."</p>

<p>"This is not a question for any of us to decide!" cried
Borghini. Bethinking himself of prudence, he went around the
table, and whispered in the old woman's ear. This time I was able
to read his lips. He said: "The Maestro must know."</p>

<p>"Who's to tell him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I will. I'll telephone."</p>

<p>Like a cat, Camagli sprang between Borghini and the door.
"Non! Non! Non!" he said, showing his teeth like an animal; and
wagging his uplifted palm back and forth. "If de police is dere,
he bring him in to save his own skin! I will go. I am true!"</p>

<p>Borghini affected to shrug. He scribbled what I suppose was a
telephone number on a scrap of paper; and handed it over to
Camagli. Glancing at his wrist watch, Borghini addressed Camagli
in Italian; but the old woman pounded the bottle and commanded
him to speak English.</p>

<p>"He'll be at home," said Borghini. "At this hour he is
dressing for dinner. You had better hang about our steps for a
bit, to see if you are watched. Walk up and down the street.
Stand in front of our window, and make out you're giving a signal
to somebody inside. Then if you're not interfered with you may
know there's nobody on watch. Telephone from the booth in the
drug-store. Don't give anything away over the telephone. Just
tell him we've got the Bird of Paradise and her partner caged
here; and what's to be done with them."</p>

<p>"When you come back," put in the old woman with a truly
hideous smile. "Buy a basket, wid a covaire and steal two paving-stones. We will need dem tonight."</p>

<p>Camagli fetched his hat and coat and went out. Borghini,
biting his fingers in suspense, brushed past me, and went on
through to the front of the flat. I supposed that he had gone to
watch what became of the other. He remained away. That left the
Frenchwoman and Denis facing us. The woman took a pull at the
bottle, and undertook to feed her hatred by taunting my mistress.
She spoke in English. I shall not repeat her foul and stupid
words. Mme. Storey was oblivious to them.</p>

<p>Failing to obtain any satisfaction, the old woman fell silent,
and thenceforward devoted herself to the bottle. We were all
silent; and in that silence a strange little drama acted itself
out. The woman was too drunk by now to perceive what was going on
under her nose. I, of course, was always watching my mistress.
Being alongside of her I could not see directly into her face,
but I could see that her gaze was fixed unwaveringly on Denis. In
Denis's eyes I read her purpose by reflection.</p>

<p>The boy sat in a huddle at the table on the old woman's right,
looking even younger than he was; looking like a child sunk in
misery. The extremity of terror that he had been through had left
him mute and apathetic. For a time he refused to meet Mme.
Storey's gaze, though the very turn of his averted head betrayed
that he was electrically conscious of it. But at last by a power
stronger than his own will, his miserable, lustreless, child's
eyes were dragged around to hers. In his shame he made them look
stupid and hard. He quickly lowered them.</p>

<p>But they came back to her, they had to come back, and the
expression subtly changed. Fear sprang up in them; a wild, panic
terror. He looked away quickly, his face worked, he even made as
if to get up and leave the room, but dropped back in his chair as
if he had been pulled down. He looked at her again, terrified
imploring, helpless. He seemed half out of his wits. Perfect
silence in the room, and those eyes crying out: I cannot do it!
Don't ask it of me! I cannot! I cannot! I cannot! One held one's
breath in the presence of that struggle going on in the boy's
soul. Not a muscle of Mme. Storey's face changed. I could just
see the side of her full, bright eye, fixed so gravely on the
boy.</p>

<p>Another change took place in his eyes. The panic died away. A
self-forgetful look appeared there that made his eyes beautiful;
a look of rapt devotion. The struggle was over. They lifted and
clung to my mistress's eyes like a dog's. And as they clung
there, the final change appeared. One saw resolution grow in
their depths like the starting of a fire. The whole pale face
hardened and became manly. All this happened in a minute or two,
of course. Denis jumped up all of a piece and snatched up the gun
from in front of the old woman.</p>

<p>Suddenly made aware of her helplessness, a look of drunken
terror appeared in the Frenchwoman's slack face. She struggled to
her feet, but had not the strength to leave the support of her
chair. "Raymo! Raymo!" she cried hoarsely and breathlessly.</p>

<p>Having got the gun in his hands, Denis for a moment appeared
to be at a loss what to do with it. But in the same instant Mme.
Storey's hands appeared as if by magic from behind her. While
sitting there before their very eyes she had succeeded in freeing
the upper part of her body.</p>

<p>"Give me the gun," she said crisply to Denis in French.
"Quick! fetch a knife to cut my legs free."</p>

<p>She stood up. Thus when Borghini came tumbling through the
portieres it was to find the blunt barrel of the automatic almost
sticking in his face. He caught his breath in a loud sob, and
went staggering back against the door into the hall. His eyes
were crazed.</p>

<p>"Stand where you are!" said Mme. Storey. And to the woman:
"Sit down! If either of you move without permission I will shoot.
After what I have heard here I would be glad of the excuse to
shoot."</p>

<p>Denis meanwhile had brought a wicked-looking bread knife, with
which he proceeded to cut the ropes that bound her legs. Both
Borghini and the old woman glared at the lad with inhuman
venomous hatred. My mistress stepped clear of the chair, stamping
her feet to restore the circulation. Mme. Storey was herself
again. Her eyes were as bright as stars. As always at moments of
deadly tension, a little smile played about her lips. Denis
transferred his attentions to me.</p>

<p>"Cut the rope as little as possible," said Mme. Storey. "I
have further need of it."</p>

<p>When Denis was done, Mme. Storey possessed herself of the
knife. The old woman began to vituperate the lad in her slow and
heavy fashion. I could not understand a word of it, but it was
clear her wicked tongue was distilling poison. Denis flinched
from it. Mme. Storey, glancing sideways at him, made up her mind.
When I stood free she said to Borghini:</p>

<p>"Hold your hands above your head."</p>

<p>To me, she added: "Feel of his pockets to see if he has a
weapon."</p>

<p>It was an ordeal for me to have to put my hands on him. I kept
my face averted. I could feel hatred coming out of him as in
waves. But he dared not move. He was not armed.</p>

<p>"Now, Bella," said Mme. Storey, "go to the top drawer of the
woman's bureau, and arm yourself with her gun. It is the only one
in the house."</p>

<p>I obeyed. The gun was about as much use to me as to a young
child; but they did not know that.</p>

<p>Borghini was forced to sit in a chair, where I bound him fast
to the back and to the legs, making very sure there could be no
slip. While I was so engaged, he whined to Mme. Storey for
mercy.</p>

<p>"I was on your side from the start. I leave it to your friend
here if I wasn't trying to save you. If it hadn't been for me
you'd be dead by now."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled at him in a steely fashion. She helped
herself to a cigarette from the mantelpiece, and blew a cloud of
smoke with manifest enjoyment.</p>

<p>I gagged the man also; and then by Mme. Storey's orders, Denis
and I dragged him chair and all into the kitchen out of sight. We
likewise tied the old woman to her chair, but the ropes were
hidden under the table. Denis's eyes were continually on the door
into the hall, full of dread at the imminent return of Camagli.
The poor kid was shaking. Mme. Storey flung an arm around his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Courage, mon brave!" said she. "You are my man now. It is
impossible that you should fail me!"</p>

<p>The boy lifted his eyes to her with a rapt look, and snatching
up her hand pressed it to his lips. There was no art in that
gesture.</p>

<p>As for me, strange to say, I was not frightened at that
moment. I did not feel anything in particular. I was like an
automatic woman moving this way and that under the direction of
my mistress's glance.</p>

<p>She bade me sit down exactly as I had been sitting in the
first place, with my hands behind me as if they were tied to the
back of the chair, and my legs pressed close to the rounds. She
said "He will not notice in the first instant that the ropes are
gone."</p>

<p>She tied a handkerchief loosely over my mouth, and, gagging
herself in the same manner, sat down beside me as at first. She,
however, kept her right hand out to cover the woman with the gun.
She said to the woman:</p>

<p>"If you attempt to warn him I will shoot."</p>

<p>Finally we heard Camagli's firm tread coming along the hall.
Mme. Storey whispered encouragement to Denis in French. At the
same time she raised the gun and sighted along the barrel. The
Frenchwoman closed her eyes as if in sudden faintness. It
appeared that that great jellyfish knew the meaning of fear, too.
Camagli tapped on the door in a particular way, and softly spoke
his name.</p>

<p>Denis opened the door and Camagli stepped in. At first glance,
of course, except for the absence of Borghini, the room appeared
exactly as he had left it. He spoke out without hesitation:</p>

<p>"He come right away. Ten minute. He say put a white cloth on
the front window-sill if all is safe for him to come in."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey stood up.</p>

<p>"Thanks," she drawled. "That was what I wanted."</p>

<p>Camagli spun around on his heel. In him Mme. Storey had very
different material from Borghini to deal with and she knew it. He
was as lightning-quick as a wild animal. He sprang at her
regardless of the gun. Giving ground a little she dropped the
gun, and whipping out the bread-knife, caught him full on the
point. The knife drove clear through his body, entering in the
fleshy hollow between shoulder and breast.</p>

<p>He whirled around like a tee-totum, his face convulsed in a
horrible expression of shock, while he dragged at the handle of
the knife. He got it out and flung it crimson and dripping across
the room. Then he toppled over sideways with a crash. A long-drawn groan escaped him. I handed the gun back to my
mistress.</p>

<p>She stood looking down at him coldly. She said:</p>

<p>"I could not take the risk of rousing the neighbourhood with a
shot. He is nothing. It is he who is coming that I want...Help me
to take him into the kitchen, Bella."</p>

<p>Denis was sent into the front room to display a white cloth on
the window-sill. In the kitchen Mme. Storey deftly cut away the
wounded man's clothing and improvised a bandage out of a clean
towel, which we scorched on top of the stove in the approved
manner.</p>

<p>He was bleeding profusely, but it was not a dangerous wound.
Throughout the operation he glared at us with his soulless,
animal eyes, without making a sound. Close beside us in the
narrow room sat Borghini, bound and gagged, and in a state of
collapse through sheer funk. We had to work swiftly. It was
necessary as a matter of precaution to bind Camagli's uninjured
arm behind his back, to tie his ankles together, and to gag
him.</p>

<p>When we got back to the dining-room, Denis was in a pitiable
state.</p>

<p>"I cannot face him!" he gasped out. "Not <i>him</i>!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey gripped his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Denis," she said, "I must have you to open the door for him.
The instant the door is opened you may slip out, and go telephone
the police." She wrote down Inspector Rumsey's telephone number.
"And, Denis," she added kindly, "do not come back here; I don't
want to have to hand you over. Go to my office and wait for
me."</p>

<p>"But you? But you?" stammered the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall be all right," she answered, smiling broadly. "I
have taken his measure."</p>

<p>Turning his back on us, Denis leaned his arms against the wall
and buried his face in them, struggling to get a grip on
himself.</p>

<p>Then we had nothing to do but wait. Ah! that is shattering to
the stoutest nerves. I began to tremble all over. When I thought
of the crimes of this man we were waiting for, he swelled up in
my imagination like a nightmare creature. Hysteria gripped my
throat. I dug my nails into my palms. Mme. Storey lit another
cigarette, humming a little tune.</p>

<p>We heard a soft, heavy tread come down the hall, and little
Denis tamed a ghastly face.</p>

<p>He tapped on the door in the same manner that Camagli had
tapped, but did not speak. Denis opened the door and he stepped
in. Denis disappeared without my seeing him go. Mme. Storey and I
had drawn back against the portieres that the man might not see
us too soon. Thus he presented his back to us. A dignified figure
and elegantly dressed. There was something familiar about that
back. Still, I did not recognise him immediately. Mme. Storey
did.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Bleecker," she said musically. "What a
charming surprise to find you here!"</p>

<p>He turned around.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="first">An hour later, Mme. Storey and I were sitting in
Inspector Rumsey's office at Police Headquarters, our four
prisoners safely disposed in cells. Ah! how good it was to find
oneself in that ugly, garishly-lighted room, surrounded by
muscular blue-coats. Safe! Safe! Safe! I could not get over it.
My mistress in a scarlet evening dress with a sable wrap about
her shoulders was recklessly smoking one cigarette after another.
What a contrast between that picture and the one she had made an
hour before in the sordid flat on East Seventy-__ street!</p>

<p>"Well, what are the main lines of your case?" asked the
Inspector, rubbing his hands together in high satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You have already guessed a good part of it," said Mme.
Storey. "Here was Algernon Bleecker, an impoverished man with the
most expensive and luxurious tastes, and no moral sense whatever.
His one asset consisted in his social connections which were of
the very highest sort. He has acted for years as a sort of
steerer in society for the fabulously rich, but that didn't
provide scope enough for his talents. He found his opportunity in
the general laxity amongst the rich since the war. Why, nowadays,
our rich youngsters get married as carelessly as they go to
dinner!</p>

<p>"Bleecker, with characteristic acuteness, perceived that the
foreign nobleman had had his day. The comic strips have made him
ridiculous. So he conceived the new idea of importing handsome
foreign youngsters. He was perfectly indifferent to their social
status so long as they were good-looking. But they had to be poor
and obscure, so that he might obtain a complete ascendency over
them. He frequented the worst quarters of European cities,
looking for suitable subjects. When he got them here he had them
put through a course of training according to their needs.</p>

<p>"I don't know how long he's been at it. It would be better not
to inquire. It worked like a charm. Apparently he has met with no
check whatever until the past week or two. The extreme good-looks
of the young men, their foreignness, their beautiful manners,
rendered them highly romantic figures in the eyes of our hothouse
girls. If the full truth of Bleecker's operations became known it
might bring about a social cataclysm. We must suppress it so far
as we are able.</p>

<p>"I charge Bleecker with the murder of Pedro d'Escobar. His
motive was the anger or fear induced by learning that d'Escobar
had talked imprudently to me. All the evidence is in your hands.
Moreover, Denis de Cachebois, who witnessed the murder, will take
the stand for the State. It was a remark that I overheard
Borghini make to-night that informed me Bleecker had himself
killed d'Escobar. I was not surprised, because the first time
Bleecker approached me I apprehended that there existed under
that smooth, effeminate, luxurious exterior, an insane streak of
cruelty. Bleecker <i>enjoyed</i> committing those two murders.
And how many others I don't know..."</p>

<p>"<i>&gt;Two</i> murders?" interrupted the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes. I also charge him with the murder of Arpad Rody."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Inspector Rumsey.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Madame Storey smiling, "you gentlemen of the force
have not displayed your usual perspicacity in respect to that
case. It was evident to me from the beginning that neither Van
Sicklen Harker nor his daughter could have fired the shot that
killed Rody. Otherwise the maid must have heard it, not to speak
of others in the hotel. It struck me as strange, too, that they
all went into the bedroom of the suite for their conference about
the money settlement. The reason given was that the maid might
not overhear; but if you will examine the plan of the suite you
will see that there were the same number of doors between
sitting-room and bedroom as there was between bedroom and
bedroom: <i>i.e.</i> two. If they didn't want the maid to
overhear, why didn't they send her out of the suite altogether?
Arpad Rody had some other reason for leading them into the
bedroom.</p>

<p>"What reason could he have had? A friend concealed in the
bedroom perhaps to overhear all that passed? Where could such a
man have been concealed? In the clothes-closet near the head of
the bed. As soon as I examined the bedroom I discovered why no
shot had been heard. Rody had first been rendered unconscious by
a blow on the head, his body then laid on the bed and the gun
pressed to his temple, <i>covered by a pillow.</i> How did I
discover this? The pillow had been tossed back to its usual place
at the head of the bed. Them were no burns upon the pillow-case.
The murderer had provided against this by placing
something&mdash;let us say his handkerchief, between. But several
hours after the murder one of the pillows in the room, and only
one, was still strongly impregnated with the odour of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>"You, and everybody else engaged on the case, believed that
Van Sicklen Harker was lying when he gave his second version of
what had happened; but from this point I preferred to go upon the
assumption that he had told the simple truth. What then had
happened after Harker had rushed from the suite in a distracted
state, after signing the settlement? Rody's friend or partner had
stepped out of his hiding-place, they had quarrelled over the
division of the spoils, whereupon the unknown man had snatched up
Harker's gun, struck Rody over the head with it, and afterwards
shot him in the manner I have described. He tossed the pistol out
of the window and made his escape. The certain finding of the
pistol gave him no concern since he knew it was Harker's.</p>

<p>"That was as far as I got then. The murderer was unknown to
me. But in d'Escobar's unwitting disclosures about the American
who picked up likely lads in Europe and brought them over here to
get them rich American wives, I got my clue. When d'Escobar was
murdered next day I knew that in his murderer I would lay my
hands on the murderer of Arpad Rody. And so it happened. From
Borghini's lips to-night as we were hidden we heard the proof of
it. Bleecker was concealed in that room in order to advise Rody
how to proceed in his negotiations with Harker. Perhaps they had
arranged a code of signals. We will find, I believe, that
Bleecker had engaged a room on the same corridor, to be used
while Bleecker was in the clothes closet. At any rate, after he
had got the best of Harker, Rody, flushed with triumph, thought
he could get the best of his master, too. He undertook to turn
Bleecker down and Bleecker killed him."</p>

<p>The Inspector shot forth his hand.</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" he cried. "You have never done a finer piece of
work!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Mme. Storey, rising. "I'm glad we got him
though! You should have seen his face when he turned round and
saw us! That was worth a year's income!...And now Bella and I
<i>must</i> get our dinners! See you to-morrow!"</p>

<p>As we drove up-town I said: "You knew it was Bleecker before
he came through the door?"</p>

<p>She admitted it.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, by a dozen indications, trifling in themselves to take
into court. The murder was written in his eyes. I knew, and he
knew that I knew, but he didn't think I could bring it home to
him."</p>

<p>Everybody knows the result. Since Denis was ready to testify
for the prosecution, Bleecker was tried first for the murder of
d'Escobar. If he had by any fluke escaped, the State was ready to
proceed with the other case. But he was convicted, and in due
course executed. The Countess (who by the way was a genuine
Countess, a de Courcy), and Attilio Camagli set up the defence
that they had acted under duress, and they got off with verdicts
of manslaughter. They are serving long terms. According to
Denis's story on the stand, he had no hand in the actual murder.
Whether this was true or not I can't say. At any rate the State
was satisfied with having him deported to France. I for one was
glad of it.</p>

<p>Raymo Borghini was never tried at all. He was not present at
the murder, and it was thought better not to bring any charge of
conspiracy against him. Shortly afterwards his rich wife obtained
a French divorce, and he disappeared from the American scene, as
did likewise the handsome Albert Fleury, late of the <i>New York
Universe.</i> No actual connection was proved to exist between
Bleecker and John Jerrold, but the disclosures at the trial
ruined Jerrold just the same. He, too, left our shores. People
speak of meeting him wandering about Paris a miserable
creature.</p>

<p>A complete reconciliation took place between Van Sicklen
Harker and Cornelia, and they sailed away together for their
delayed tour of the world. I have never seen little Cornelia
since; but I do hope that this experience knocked some sense into
her pretty head. She has since, as all the world knows, married
an upstanding young Anglo-Saxon, and they appear to be happy.</p>
