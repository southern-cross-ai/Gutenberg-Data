  <p class="first">"I AM too modest!" snapped the great Haskel van Manderpootz,
  pacing irritably about the limited area of his private laboratory, glaring at
  me the while. "That is the trouble. I undervalue my own achievements, and
  thereby permit petty imitators like Corveille to influence the committee and
  win the Morell prize."</p>

  <p>"But," I said soothingly, "you've won the Morell physics award half a
  dozen times, professor. They can't very well give it to you every year."</p>

  <p>"Why not, since it is plain that I deserve it?" bristled the professor.
  "Understand, Dixon, that I do not regret my modesty, even though it permits
  conceited fools like Corveille, who have infinitely less reason than I for
  concert, to win awards that mean nothing save prizes for successful bragging.
  Bah! To grant an award for research along such obvious lines that I neglected
  to mention them, thinking that even a Morell judge would appreciate their
  obviousness! Research on the psychon, eh! Who discovered the psychon? Who but
  van Manderpootz?"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't that what you got last year's award for?" I asked consolingly.
  "And after all, isn't this modesty, this lack of jealousy on your part, a
  symbol of greatness of character?"</p>

  <p>"True&mdash;true!" said the great van Manderpootz, mollified. "Had such an
  affront been committed against a lesser man than myself, he would doubtless
  have entered a bitter complaint against the judges. But not I. Anyway, I know
  from experience that it wouldn't do any good. And besides, despite his
  greatness, van Manderpootz is as modest and shrinking as a violet." At this
  point he paused, and his broad red face tried to look violet-like.</p>

  <p>I suppressed a smile. I knew the eccentric genius of old from the days
  when I had been Dixon Wells, undergraduate student of engineering, and had
  taken a course in Newer Physics (that is, in Relativity) under the famous
  professor. For some unguessable reason, he had taken a fancy to me, and as a
  result, I had been involved in several of his experiments since graduation.
  There was the affair of the subjunctivisor, for instance, and also that of
  the idealizator; in the first of these episodes I had suffered the indignity
  of falling in love with a girl two weeks after she was apparently dead, and
  in the second, the equal or greater indignity of falling in love with a girl
  who didn't exist, never had existed, and never would exist&mdash;" in other
  words, with an ideal. Perhaps I'm a little susceptible to feminine charms, or
  rather, perhaps I used to be, for since the disaster of the idealizator, I
  have grimly relegated such follies to the past, much to the disgust of
  various 'vision entertainers, singers, dancers, and the like.</p>

  <p>So of late I had been spending my days very seriously trying
  wholeheartedly to get to the office on time just once, so that I could refer
  to it next time my father accused me of never getting anywhere on time. I
  hadn't succeeded yet, but fortunately the N. J. Wells Corporation was wealthy
  enough to survive even without the full-time services of Dixon Wells, or
  should I say even with them? Anyway, I'm sure my father preferred to have me
  late in the morning after an evening with van Manderpootz than after one with
  Tips Alva or Whimsy White, or one of the numerous others of the ladies of the
  'vision screen. Even in the twenty-first century he retained a lot of
  old-fashioned ideas.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz had ceased to remember that he was as modest and shrinking
  as a violet. "It has just occurred to me," he announced impressively, "that
  years have character much as humans have. This year, 2015, will be remembered
  in history as a very stupid year, in which the Morell prize was given to a
  nincompoop. Last year, on the other hand, was a very intelligent year, a
  jewel in the crown of civilization. Not only was the Morell prize given to
  van Manderpootz, but I announced my discrete field theory in that year, and
  the University unveiled Gogli's statue of me as well." He sighed. "Yes, a
  very intelligent year! What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"It depends on how you look at it," I responded glumly. "I didn't enjoy it
  so much, what with Joanna Caldwell and Denise d'Agrion, and your infernal
  experiments. It's all in the point of view."</p>

  <p>The professor snorted. "Infernal experiments, eh! Point of view! Of course
  it's all in the point of view. Even Einstein's simple little synthesis was
  enough to prove that. If the whole world could adopt an intelligent and
  admirable point of view&mdash;that of van Manderpootz, for instance&mdash;
  all troubles would be over. If it were possible&mdash;" He paused, and an
  expression of amazed wonder spread over his ruddy face.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Matter? I am astonished! The astounding depths of genius awe me. I am
  overwhelmed with admiration at the incalculable mysteries of a great
  mind."</p>

  <p>"I don't get the drift."</p>

  <p>"Dixon," he said impressively, "you have been privileged to look upon an
  example of the workings of a genius. More than that, you have planted the
  seed from which perhaps shall grow the towering tree of thought. Incredible
  as it seems, you, Dixon Wells, have given van Manderpootz an ideal It is thus
  that genius seizes upon the small, the unimportant, the negligible, and turns
  it to its own grand purposes. I stand awe-struck!"</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Wait," said van Manderpootz, still in rapt admiration of the majesty of
  his own mind. "When the tree bears fruit, you shall see it. Until then, be
  satisfied that you have played a part in its planting."</p>

  <p>It was perhaps a month before I saw van Manderpootz again, but one bright
  spring evening his broad, rubicund face looked out of the phone-screen at
  me.</p>

  <p>"It's ready," he announced impressively.</p>

  <p>"What is?"</p>

  <p>The professor looked pained at the thought that I could have forgotten.
  "The tree has borne fruit," he explained. "If you wish to drop over to my
  quarters, we'll proceed to the laboratory and try it out. I do not set a
  time, so that it will be utterly impossible for you to be late."</p>

  <p>I ignored that last dig, but had a time been set, I would doubtless have
  been even later than usual, for it was with some misgivings that I induced
  myself to go at all. I still remembered the unpleasantness of my last two
  experiences with the inventions of van Manderpootz. However, at last we were
  seated in the small laboratory, while out in the larger one the professor's
  technical assistant, Carter, puttered over some device, and in the far corner
  his secretary, the plain and unattractive Miss Fitch, transcribed lecture
  notes, for van Manderpootz abhorred the thought that his golden utterances
  might be lost to posterity. On the table between the professor and myself lay
  a curious device, something that looked like a cross between a pair of nose-
  glasses and a miner's lamp.</p>

  <p>"There it is," said van Manderpootz proudly. "There lies my attitudinizor,
  which may well become an epoch-making device."</p>

  <p>"How? What does it do?"</p>

  <p>"I will explain. The germ of the idea traces back to that remark of yours
  about everything depending on the point of view. A very obvious statement, of
  course, but genius seizes on the obvious and draws from it the obscure. Thus
  the thoughts of even the simplest mind can suggest to the man of genius his
  sublime conceptions, as is evident from the fact that I got this idea from
  you."</p>

  <p>"What idea?"</p>

  <p>"Be patient. There is much you must understand first. You must realize
  just bow true is the statement that everything depends on the point of view.
  Einstein proved that motion, space, and time depend on the particular point
  of view of the observer, or as he expressed it, on the scale of reference
  used. I go farther than that, infinitely farther. I propound the theory that
  the observer is the point of view. I go even beyond that, I maintain that the
  world itself is merely the point of view!"</p>

  <p>"Hub?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," proceeded van Manderpootz. "It is obvious that the world I
  see is entirely different from the one in which you live. It is equally
  obvious that a strictly religious man occupies a different world than that of
  a materialist. The fortunate man lives in a happy world; the unfortunate man
  sees a world of misery. One man is happy with little, another is miserable
  with much. Each sees the world from his own point of view, which is the same
  as saying that each lives in his own world. Therefore there are as many
  worlds as there are points of view.</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "that theory is to disregard reality. Out of all the
  different points of view, there must be one that is right, and all the rest
  are wrong."</p>

  <p>"One would think so," agreed the professor. "One would think that between
  the point of view of you, for instance, as contrasted with that of, say van
  Manderpootz, there would be small doubt as to which was correct. However,
  early in the twentieth century, Heisenberg enunciated his Principle of
  Uncertainty, which proved beyond argument that a completely accurate
  scientific picture of the world is quite impossible, that the law of cause
  and effect is merely a phase of the law of chance, that no infallible
  predictions can ever be made, and that what science used to call natural laws
  arc really only descriptions of the way in which the human mind perceives
  nature. In other words, the character of the world depends entirely on the
  mind observing it, or, to return to my earlier statement&mdash;" the point of
  view."</p>

  <p>"But no one can ever really understand another person's point of view," I
  said. "It isn't fair to undermine the whole basis of science because you
  can't be sure that the color we both call red wouldn't look green to you if
  you could see it through my eyes."</p>

  <p>"Ali!" said van Manderpootz triumphantly. "So we come now to my
  attitudinizor. Suppose that it were possible for me to see through your eyes,
  or you through mine. Do you see what a boon such an ability would be to
  humanity? Not only from the standpoint of science, but also because it would
  obviate all troubles due to misunderstandings. And even more." Shaking his
  finger, the professor recited oracularly,</p>

  <p class="verse">"'Oh, wad some pow'r the giftie gie us<br>
  To see oursel's as ithers see us.'</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz is that power, Dixon. Through my attitudinizor, one may at
  last adopt the viewpoint of another. The poet's plaint of more than two
  centuries ago is answered at last."</p>

  <p>"How the devil do you see through somebody else's eyes?"</p>

  <p>"Very simply. You will recall the idealizator. Now it is obvious that when
  I peered over your shoulder and perceived in the mirror your conception of
  the ideal woman, I was, to a certain extent, adopting your point of view. In
  that case the psychons given off by your mind were converted into quanta of
  visible light, which could be seen. In the case of my attitudinizor, the
  process is exactly reversed. One flashes the beam of this light on the
  subject whose point of view is desired; the visible light is reflected back
  with a certain accompaniment of psychons, which are here intensified to a
  degree which will permit them to be, so to speak, appreciated?"</p>

  <p>"Psychons?"</p>

  <p>"Have you already forgotten my discovery of the unit particle of thought?
  Must I explain again how the cosmons, chronons, spations, psychons, and all
  other particles are interchangeable? And that," he continued abstractedly,
  "leads to certain interesting speculations. Suppose I were to convert, say, a
  ton of material protons and electrons into spations&mdash;that is, convert
  matter into space. I calculate that a ton of matter will produce
  approximately a cubic mile of space. Now the question is, where would we put
  it, since all the space we have is already occupied by space? Or if I
  manufactured an hour or two of time? It is obvious that we have no time to
  fit in an extra couple of hours, since all our time is already accounted for.
  Doubtless it will take a certain amount of thought for even van Manderpootz
  to solve these problems, but at the moment I am curious to watch the workings
  of the attitudinizor. Suppose you put it on, Dixon."</p>

  <p>"I? Haven't you tried it out yet?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. In the first place, what has van Manderpootz to gain by
  studying the viewpoints of other people? The object of the device is to
  permit people to study nobler viewpoints than their own. And in the second
  place, I have asked myself whether it is fair to the world for van
  Manderpootz to be the first to try out a new and possibly untrustworthy
  device, and I reply, 'No!'"</p>

  <p>"But I should try it out, eh? Well, every time I try out any of your
  inventions I find myself in some kind of trouble. I'd be a fool to go around
  looking for more difficulty, wouldn't l?"</p>

  <p>"I assure you that my viewpoint will be much less apt to get you into
  trouble than your own," said van Manderpootz with dignity. "There will be no
  question of your becoming involved in some impossible love affair as long as
  you stick to that."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, despite the assurance of the great scientist, I was more
  than a little reluctant to don the device. Yet I was curious, as well; it
  seemed a fascinating prospect to be able to look at the world through other
  eyes, as fascinating as visiting a new world&mdash;" which it was, according
  to the professor. So after a few moments of hesitation, I picked up the
  instrument, slipped it over my head so that the eyeglasses were in the proper
  position, and looked inquiringly at van Manderpootz.</p>

  <p>"You must turn it on," he said, reaching over and clicking a switch on the
  frame. "Now flash the light to my face. That's the way; just center the
  circle of light on my face. And now what do you see?"</p>

  <p>I didn't answer; what I saw was, for the moment, quite indescribable. I
  was completely dazed and bewildered, and it was only when some involuntary
  movement of my head at last flashed the light from the professor's face to
  the table top that a measure of sanity returned, which proves at least that
  tables do not possess any point of view.</p>

  <p>"O-o-o-h!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz beamed. "Of course you are overwhelmed. One could hardly
  expect to adopt the view of van Manderpootz without some difficulties of
  adjustment. A second time will be easier."</p>

  <p>I reached up and switched off the light. "A second time will not only be
  easier, but also impossible," I said crossly. "I'm not going to experience
  another dizzy spell like that for anybody."</p>

  <p>"But of course you will, Dixon. I am certain that the dizziness will be
  negligible on the second trial. Naturally the unexpected heights affected
  yon, much as if you were to come without warning to the brink of a colossal
  precipice. But this time you will be prepared, and the effect will be much
  less."</p>

  <p>Well, it was. After a few moments I was able to give my full attention to
  the phenomena of the attitudinizor, and queer phenomena they were, too. I
  scarcely know how to describe the sensation of looking at the world through
  the filter of another's mind. It is almost an indescribable experience, but
  so, in the ultimate analysis, is any other experience.</p>

  <p>What I saw first was a kaleidoscopic array of colors and shapes, but the
  amazing, astounding, inconceivable thing about the scene was that there was
  no single color I could recognize! The eyes of van Manderpootz, or perhaps
  his brain, interpreted color in a fashion utterly alien to the way in which
  my own functioned, and the resultant spectrum was so bizarre that there is
  simply no way of describing any single tint in words. To say, as I did to the
  professor, that his conception of red looked to me like a shade between
  purple and green conveys absolutely no meaning, and the only way a third
  person could appreciate the meaning would be to examine my point of view
  through an attitudinizor while I was examining that of van Manderpootz. Thus
  he could apprehend my conception of van Manderpootz's reaction to the color
  red.</p>

  <p>And shapes! It took me several minutes to identify the weird, angular,
  twisted, distorted appearance in the center of the room as the plain
  laboratory table. Even the mountainies know about him, eh?"</p>

  <p>But by far the strangest part of his point of view had nothing to do with
  the outlook upon the physical world, but with the more fundamental elements
  &mdash;" with his attitudes. Most of his thoughts, on that first occasion,
  were beyond me, because I had not yet learned to interpret the personal
  symbolism in which he thought. But I did understand his attitudes. There was
  Carter, for instance, toiling away out in the large laboratory; I saw at once
  what a plodding, unintelligent drudge he seemed to van Manderpootz. And there
  was Miss Fitch; I confess that she had always seemed unattractive to me, but
  my impression of her was Venus herself beside that of the professor! She
  hardly seemed human to him and I am sure that he never thought of her as a
  woman, but merely as a piece of convenient but unimportant laboratory
  equipment.</p>

  <p>At this point I caught a glimpse of myself through the eyes of van
  Manderpootz. Ouch! Perhaps I'm not a genius, but I'm dead certain that I'm
  not the grinning ape I appeared to be in his eyes. And perhaps I'm not
  exactly the handsomest man in the world either, but if I thought I looked
  like that&mdash;! And then, to cap the climax, I apprehended van
  Manderpootz's conception of himself!</p>

  <p>"That's enough!" I yelled. "I won't stay around here just to be insulted.
  I'm through!"</p>

  <p>I tore the attitudinizor from my head and tossed it to the table, feeling
  suddenly a little foolish at the sight of the grin on the face of the
  professor.</p>

  <p>"That is hardly the spirit which has led science to its great
  achievements, Dixon," he observed amiably. "Suppose you describe the nature
  of the insults, and if possible, something about the workings of the
  attitudinizor as well. After all, that is what you were supposed to be
  observing."</p>

  <p>I flushed, grumbled a little, and complied. Van Manderpootz listened with
  great interest to my description of the difference in our physical worlds,
  especially the variations in our perceptions of form and color.</p>

  <p>"What a field for an artist!" he ejaculated at last. "Unfortunately, it is
  a field that must remain forever untapped, because even though an artist
  examined a thousand viewpoints and learned innumerable new colors, his
  pigments would continue to impress his audience with the same old colors each
  of them had always known." He sighed thoughtfully, and then proceeded.
  "However, the device is apparently quite safe to use. I shall therefore try
  it briefly, bringing to the investigation a calm, scientific mind which
  refuses to be troubled by the trifles that seem to bother you."</p>

  <p>He donned the attitudinizor, and I must confess that he stood the shock of
  the first trial somewhat better than I did. After a surprised "Oof!" he
  settled down to a complacent analysis of my point of view, while I sat
  somewhat self-consciously under his calm appraisal. Calm, that is, for about
  three minutes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he leaped to his feet, tearing the device from a face whose
  normal ruddiness had deepened to a choleric angry color. "Get out!" he
  roared. "So that's the way van Manderpootz looks to you! Moron! Idiot!
  Imbecile! Get out!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a week or ten days later that I happened to be
passing the
  University on my way from somewhere to somewhere else, and I fell to
  wondering whether the professor had yet forgiven me. There was a light in the
  window of his laboratory over in the Physics Building, so I dropped in,
  making my way past the desk where Carter labored, and the corner where Miss
  Fitch sat in dull primness at her endless task of transcribing lecture
  notes.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz greeted me cordially enough, but with a curious assumption
  of melancholy in his manner. "Ali, Dixon," he began, "I am glad to see you.
  Since our last meeting, I have learned much of the stupidity of the world,
  and it appears to me now that you are actually one of the more intelligent
  contemporary minds."</p>

  <p>This from van Manderpootz! "Why&mdash;thank you," I said.</p>

  <p>"It is true. For some days I have sat at the window overlooking the street
  there, and have observed the viewpoints of the passersby. Would you believe"
  &mdash;his voice lowered&mdash;"would you believe that only seven and
  four-tenths percent are even aware of the existence of van Manderpootz? And
  doubtless many of the few that are, come from among the students in the
  neighborhood. I knew that the average level of intelligence was low, but it
  had not occurred to me that it was as low as that."</p>

  <p>"After all," I said consolingly, "you must remember that the achievements
  of van Manderpootz are such as to attract the attention of the intelligent
  few rather than of the many."</p>

  <p>"A very silly paradox!" be snapped. "On the basis of that theory, since
  the higher one goes in the scale of intelligence, the fewer individuals one
  finds, the greatest achievement of all is one that nobody has heard of. By
  that test you would be greater than van Manderpootz, an obvious <i>reductio
  ad absurdum."</i></p>

  <p>He glared his reproof that I should even have thought of the point, then
  something in the outer laboratory caught his ever-observant eye.</p>

  <p>"Carter!" he roared. "Is that a synobasical interphasometer in the
  positronic flow? Fool! What sort of measurements do you expect to make when
  your measuring instrument itself is part of the experiment? Take it out and
  start over!"</p>

  <p>He rushed away toward the unfortunate technician. I settled idly back in
  my chair and stared about the small laboratory, whose walls had seen so many
  marvels. The latest, the attitudinizor, lay carelessly on the table, dropped
  there by the professor after his analysis of the mass viewpoint of the
  pedestrians in the street below.</p>

  <p>I picked up the device and fell to examining its construction. Of course
  this was utterly beyond me, for no ordinary engineer can hope to grasp the
  intricacies of a van Manderpootz concept. So, after a puzzled but admiring
  survey of its infinitely delicate wires and grids and lenses, I made the
  obvious move. I put it on.</p>

  <p>My first thought was the street, but since the evening was well along, the
  walk below the window was deserted. Back in my chair again, I sat musing idly
  when a faint sound that was not the rumbling of the professor's voice
  attracted my attention. I identified it shortly as the buzzing of a heavy
  fly, butting its head stupidly against the pane of glass that separated the
  small laboratory from the large room beyond. I wondered casually what the
  viewpoint of a fly was like, and ended by flashing the light on the
  creature.</p>

  <p>For some moments I saw nothing other than I had been seeing right along
  from my own personal point of view, because, as van Manderpootz explained
  later, the psychons from the miserable brain of a fly are too few to produce
  any but the vaguest of impressions. But gradually I became aware of a
  picture, a queer and indescribable scene.</p>

  <p>Flies are color-blind. That was my first impression, for the world was a
  dull panorama of grays and whites and blacks. Flies are extremely
  nearsighted; when I had finally identified the scene as the interior of the
  familiar room, I discovered that it seemed enormous to the insect, whose
  vision did not extend more than six feet, though it did take in almost a
  complete sphere, so that the creature could see practically in all directions
  at once. But perhaps the most astonishing thing, though I did not think of it
  until later, was that the compound eye of the insect, did not convey to it
  the impression of a vast number of separate pictures, such as the eye
  produces when a microphotograph is taken through it. The fly sees one picture
  just as we do; in the same way as our brain rights the upside-down image cast
  on our retina, the fly's brain reduces the compound image to one. And beyond
  these impressions were a wild hodgepodge of smell-sensations, and a strange
  desire to burst through the invisible glass barrier into the brighter light
  beyond. But I had no time to analyze these sensations, for suddenly there was
  a flash of something infinitely clearer than the dim cerebrations of a
  fly.</p>

  <p>For half a minute or longer I was unable to guess what that momentary
  flash had been. I knew that I had seen something incredibly lovely, that I
  had tapped a viewpoint that looked upon something whose very presence caused
  ecstasy, but whose viewpoint it was, or what that flicker of beauty had been,
  were questions beyond my ability to answer.</p>

  <p>I slipped off the attitudinizor and sat staring perplexedly at the buzzing
  fly on the pane of glass. Out in the other room van Manderpootz continued his
  harangue to the repentant Carter, and off in a corner invisible from my
  position I could bear the rustle of papers as Miss Fitch transcribed endless
  notes. I puzzled vainly over the problem of what had happened, and then the
  solution dawned on me.</p>

  <p>The fly must have buzzed between me and one of the occupants of the outer
  laboratory. I had been following its flight with the faintly visible beam of
  the attitudinizor's light, and that beam must have flickered momentarily on
  the head of one of the three beyond the glass. But which? Van Manderpootz
  himself? It must have been either the professor or Carter, since the
  secretary was quite beyond range of the light.</p>

  <p>It seemed improbable that the cold and brilliant mind of van Manderpootz
  could be the agency of the sort of emotional ecstasy I had sensed. It must
  therefore, have been the head of the mild and inoffensive little Carter that
  the beam had tapped. With a feeling of curiosity I slipped the device back on
  my own head and sent the beam sweeping dimly into the larger room.</p>

  <p>It did not at the time occur to me that such a procedure was quite as
  discreditable as eavesdropping, or even more dishonorable, if you come right
  down to it, because it meant the theft of far more personal information than
  one could ever convey by the spoken word. But all I considered at the moment
  was my own curiosity; I wanted to learn what sort of viewpoint could produce
  that strange, instantaneous flash of beauty. If the proceeding was unethical
  &mdash;well, Heaven knows I was punished for it.</p>

  <p>So I turned the attitudinizor on Carter. At the moment, be was listening
  respectfully to van Manderpootz, and I sensed clearly his respect for the
  great man, a respect that had in it a distinct element of fear. I could bear
  Carter's impression of the booming voice of the professor, sounding somewhat
  like the modulated thunder of a god, which was not far from the little man's
  actual opinion of his master. I perceived Carter's opinion of himself, and
  his self-picture was an even more mouselike portrayal than my own impression
  of him. When, for an instant, he glanced my way, I sensed his impression of
  me, and while I'm sure that Dixon Wells is not the imbecile he appears to van
  Manderpootz, I'm equally sure that he's not the debonair man of the world be
  seemed to Carter. All in all, Carter's point of view seemed that of a timid,
  inoffensive, retiring, servile little man, and I wondered all the more what
  could have caused that vanished flash of beauty in a mind like his.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of it now. His attention was completely taken up by the
  voice of van Manderpootz, who had passed from a personal appraisal of
  Carter's stupidity to a general lecture on the fallacies of the unified field
  theory as presented by his rivals Corveille and Shrimski. Carter was
  listening with an almost worshipful regard, and I could feel his surges of
  indignation against the villains who dared to disagree with the authority of
  van Manderpootz.</p>

  <p>I sat there intent on the strange double vision of the attitudinizor,
  which was in some respects like a Horsten psychomat&mdash;that is, one is
  able to see both through his own eyes and through the eyes of his subject.
  Thus I could see van Manderpootz and Carter quite clearly, but at the same
  time I could see or sense what Carter saw and sensed. Thus I perceived
  suddenly through my own eyes that the professor had ceased talking to Carter,
  and had turned at the approach of somebody as yet invisible to me, while at
  the same time, through Carter's eyes, I saw that vision of ecstasy which had
  flashed for a moment in his mind. I saw&mdash;description is utterly
  impossible, but I saw a woman who, except possibly for the woman of the
  idealizator screen, was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen.</p>

  <p>I say description is impossible. That is the literal truth for her
  coloring, her expression, her figure, as seen through Carter's eyes, were
  completely unlike anything expressible by words, was fascinated, I could do
  nothing but watch, and I felt a wild surge of jealousy as I caught the
  adoration in the attitude of the humble Carter. She was glorious,
  magnificent, indescribable. It was with an effort that I untangled myself
  from the web o fascination enough to catch Carter's thought of her name.
  "Lisa,' he was thinking. "Lisa."</p>

  <p>What she said to van Manderpootz was in tones too low for me to hear, and
  apparently too low for Carter's ears as well else I should have heard her
  words through the attitudinizor.</p>

  <p>But both of us heard van Manderpootz's bellow in answer.</p>

  <p>"I don't care bow the dictionary pronounces the word!" he roared. "The way
  van Manderpootz pronounces a word is right!"</p>

  <p>The glorious Lisa turned silently and vanished. For a few moments I
  watched her through Carter's eyes, but as she neared the laboratory door, he
  turned his attention again to van Manderpootz, and she was lost to my
  view.</p>

  <p>And as I saw the professor close his dissertation and approach me, I
  slipped the attitudinizor from my head and forced myself to a measure of
  calm.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" I demanded. "I've got to meet her!"</p>

  <p>He looked blankly at me. "Who's who?"</p>

  <p>"Lisa! Who's Lisa?"</p>

  <p>There was not a flicker in the cool blue eves of van Manderpootz. "I don't
  know any Lisa," be said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"But you were just talking to her! Right out there!"</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz stared curiously at me; then little by little a shrewd
  suspicion seemed to dawn in his broad, intelligent features. "Hah!" he said.
  "Have you, by any chance, been using the attitudinizor?"</p>

  <p>I nodded, chill apprehension gripping me.</p>

  <p>"And is it also true that you chose to investigate the viewpoint of Carter
  out there?" At my nod, be stepped to the door that joined the two rooms, and
  closed it. When he faced me again, it was with features working into lines of
  amusement that suddenly found utterance in booming laughter. "Haw!" he
  roared. "Do you know who beautiful Lisa is? She's Fitch!"</p>

  <p>"Fitch? You're mad! She's glorious, and Fitch is plain and scrawny and
  ugly. Do you think I'm a fool?"</p>

  <p>"You ask an embarrassing question," chuckled the professor. "Listen to me,
  Dixon. The woman you saw was my secretary, Miss Fitch seen through the eyes
  of Carter. Don't you understand? The idiot Carter's in love with her!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I suppose I walked the upper levels half the night,
oblivious alike of the
  narrow strip of stars that showed between the towering walls of twenty-first
  century New York, and the intermittent war of traffic from the freight
  levels. Certainly this was the worst predicament of all those into which the
  fiendish contraptions of the great van Manderpootz had thrust me.</p>

  <p>In love with a point of view! In love with a woman who had no existence
  apart from the beglamoured eyes of Carter. It wasn't Lisa Fitch I loved;
  indeed, I rather hated her angular ugliness. What I had fallen in love with
  was the way she looked to Carter, for there is nothing in the world quite as
  beautiful as a lover's conception of his sweetheart.</p>

  <p>This predicament was far worse than my former ones. When I had fallen in
  love with a girl already dead, I could console myself with the thought of
  what might have been. When I had fallen in love with my own ideal&mdash;
  well, at least she was mine, even if I couldn't have her. But to fall in love
  with another man's conception! The only way that conception could even
  continue to exist was for Carter to remain in love with Lisa Fitch, which
  rather effectually left me outside the picture altogether. She was absolutely
  unattainable to me, for Heaven knows I didn't want the real Lisa Fitch
  &mdash;"real" meaning, of course, the one who was real to me. I suppose in
  the end Carter's Lisa Fitch was as real as the skinny scarecrow my eyes
  saw.</p>

  <p>She was unattainable&mdash;or was she? Suddenly an echo of a long-
  forgotten psychology course recurred to me. Attitudes are habits. Viewpoints
  are attitudes. Therefore viewpoints are habits. And habits can be
  learned!</p>

  <p>There was the solution! All I had to do was to learn, or to acquire by
  practice, the viewpoint of Carter. What I had to do was literally to put
  myself in his place, to look at things in his way, to see his viewpoint. For
  once I learned to do that, I could see in Lisa Fitch the very things he saw,
  and the vision would become reality to me as well as to him.</p>

  <p>I planned carefully. I did not care to face the sarcasm of the great van
  Manderpootz; therefore I would work in secret. I would visit his laboratory
  at such times as he had classes or lectures, and I would use the
  attitudinizor to study the view point of Carter, and to, as it were, practice
  that viewpoint. Thus I would have the means at hand of testing my progress,
  for all I had to do was glance at Miss Fitch without the attitudinizor. As
  soon as I began to perceive in her what Carter saw, I would know that success
  was imminent.</p>

  <p>Those next two weeks were a strange interval of time. I haunted the
  laboratory of van Manderpootz at odd hours, having learned from the
  University office what periods he devoted to his courses. When one day I
  found the attitudinizor missing, I prevailed on Carter to show me where it
  was kept, and he, influenced doubtless by my friendship for the man he
  practically worshipped, indicated the place without question. But later I
  suspect that he began to doubt his wisdom in this, for I know he thought it
  very strange for me to sit for long periods staring at him; I caught all
  sorts of puzzled questions in his mind, though as I have said, these were
  hard for me to decipher until I began to learn Carter's personal system of
  symbolism by which he thought. But at least one man was pleased&mdash;my
  father, who took my absences from the office and neglect of business as signs
  of good health and spirits, and congratulated me warmly on the
  improvement.</p>

  <p>But the experiment was beginning to work, I found myself sympathizing with
  Carter's viewpoint, and little by little the mad world in which he lived was
  becoming as logical as my own. I learned to recognize colors through his
  eyes; I learned to understand form and shape; most fundamental of all, I
  learned his values, his attitudes, his tastes. And these last were a little
  inconvenient at times, for on the several occasions when I supplemented my
  daily calls with visits to van Manderpootz in the evening, I found some
  difficulty in separating my own respectful regard for the great man from
  Carter's unreasoning worship, with the result that I was on the verge of
  blurting out the whole thing to him several times. And perhaps it was a
  guilty conscience, but I kept thinking that the shrewd blue eyes of the
  professor rested on me with a curiously suspicious expression all
  evening.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The thing was approaching its culmination. Now and then,
when I looked at
  the angular ugliness of Miss Fitch, I began to catch glimpses of the same
  miraculous beauty that Carter found in her&mdash;glimpses only, but
  harbingers of success. Each day I arrived at the laboratory with increasing
  eagerness, for each day brought me nearer to the achievement I sought. That
  is, my eagerness increased until one day I arrived to find neither Carter nor
  Miss Fitch present, but van Manderpootz, who should have been delivering a
  lecture on indeterminism, very much in evidence.</p>

  <p>"Uh&mdash;" hello," I said weakly.</p>

  <p>"Ump!" he responded, glaring at me. "So Carter was right, I see. Dixon,
  the abysmal stupidity of the human race continually astounds me with new
  evidence of its astronomical depths, but I believe this escapade of yours
  plumbs the uttermost regions of imbecility."</p>

  <p>"M-my escapade?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can escape the piercing eye of van Manderpootz? As soon
  as Carter told me you had been here in my absence, my mind leaped nimbly to
  the truth. But Carter's information was not even necessary, for half an eye
  was enough to detect the change in your attitude on these last few evening
  visits. So you've been trying to adopt Carter's viewpoint, eh? No doubt with
  the idea of ultimately depriving him of the charming Miss Fitch!"</p>

  <p>"W-why."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Dixon. We will disregard the ethics of the thing and look
  at it from a purely rational viewpoint, if a rational viewpoint is possible
  to anybody but van Manderpootz. Don't you realize that in order to attain
  Carter's attitude toward Fitch, you would have to adopt his entire viewpoint?
  Not," he added tersely, "that I think his point of view is greatly inferior
  to yours, but I happen to prefer the viewpoint of a donkey to that of a
  mouse. Your particular brand of stupidity is more agreeable to me than
  Carter's timid, weak, and subservient nature, and some day you will thank me
  for this. Was his impression of Fitch worth the sacrifice of your own
  personality?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Well, whether it was or not, van Manderpootz has decided the matter in
  the wisest way. For it's too late now, Dixon. I have given them both a
  month's leave and sent them away&mdash;on a honeymoon. They left this
  morning."</p>
