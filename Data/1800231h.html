<h3>First published in Pearson's Magazine, August 1902</h3>

<h3>The second of the Sensational Experiences of Diana Marburg, the Oracle
of Maddox Street; Related by Herself.</h3>

<hr>

<p>I WAS sitting in my drawing-room late one afternoon in the end
of a sunny and hot July, when Miss Kate Trevor was announced.</p>

<p>My brother Rupert and I had just been carrying on a discussion
as to where we were to spend the holidays. We had come to no
decision, and Kate's appearance on the scene was very welcome.</p>

<p>"How nice to catch you at home, Di!" she exclaimed. "How do you
do, Mr. Marburg?" she continued, turning to my brother and shaking
him heartily by the hand. "I was afraid you had flown like the rest
of the world."</p>

<p>"We have neither of us yet made up our minds where to go," he
answered. "The Continent does not appeal to us, and we have neither
time nor money to visit places further afield."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Kate?" I asked. "You look as if you needed
a holiday too--you are quite thin and pale. Is anything the
matter?"</p>

<p>She coloured slightly and glanced at Rupert.</p>

<p>"You want me to go away?" he said.</p>

<p>He rose lazily from his chair and left the room.</p>

<p>The moment he had closed the door behind him, Kate turned to
me.</p>

<p>"With your usual penetration, Diana," she said, "you see below
the surface. There is something the matter, and I think--I do think
that if relief does not come soon, I shall lose my senses."</p>

<p>As she spoke, her dark, lovely eyes filled with tears; the
colour mounted into her cheeks, leaving them the next instant paler
and more wan than ever.</p>

<p>"You look quite ill," I said. "What can be the matter?"</p>

<p>"I can put the case in a nutshell," she replied. "My difficulty
and my misery are both common enough. I am on the eve of becoming
engaged to one man, while with all my heart I love another."</p>

<p>"You love Captain Cunnyngham," I said. "I know all about that,
remember. I have seen him, and I approve. You, as his wife, will be
one of the most envied women in the world."</p>

<p>As I spoke, I glanced at her with all the admiration I felt for
so beautiful a girl. Kate was a friend of mine, but I knew little
or nothing about her people or her belongings; but it was only
necessary to look into the depths of her soft black eyes to know
that through some ancestor she must hail from the sunny south. No
other clime could produce such raven locks and such a clear olive
complexion. Her little features were straight and perfect in their
own way, her lips coral red, her teeth a row of pearls.</p>

<p>Now the piquant little face was quite wan with suffering, and
the coral lips drooped with all the pain of indecision.</p>

<p>"You are engaged to Captain Cunnyngham," I said. "Have you
ceased to love him, that you speak of your engagement in such
terms?"</p>

<p>"My engagement to Jim is broken off," she replied. "Not that I
love him less; on the contrary, I care more for him than I ever did
before; but circumstances are against us both, and even Jim himself
has said that we must not think of marriage for the present."</p>

<p>"Then what about your all but engagement to another man?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that," she answered. "It is a long story, Diana,
and I can only give you its mere outline. I met six months ago a
man well known in London society, of the name of Sir Edward
Granville. He fell in love with me and asked me to marry him. I
refused, but he would not take my refusal. He asked me again, and I
told him that I was engaged to Jim.</p>

<p>"Three months afterwards poor Jim lost a lot of money on the
Turf, and on making inquiries I found that he had done this in Sir
Edward Granville's company. He was nearly distracted, and came to
me himself and suggested that as far as any tie between us existed,
we were to be absolutely free. The poor fellow was quite
broken-hearted when he made this proposal. I agreed to it, for
there seemed no help for it; but since then I have been sorry that
I yielded.</p>

<p>"Immediately after my engagement with Jim was broken off, Sir
Edward brought fresh pressure to bear. My mother exercised all her
influence to induce me to accept so wealthy a man, and to give her
the gratification of knowing that I had made a brilliant match. My
father, who has lately been terribly short of money, added his
intreaties to my mother's. Still I was firm, although my life for
the last six months has been little short of misery.</p>

<p>"A week ago Sir Edward Granville called and asked to see me. I
was forced to see him, although I longed to refuse. But to my great
relief I found his attitude towards me considerably altered. He
said quite frankly that he had been thinking over matters. That he
loved me as much as ever, but on his honour as a gentleman he would
no longer persecute me. He asked me to trust him.</p>

<p>"I was surprised and grateful, and I said that I would. He then
begged for a proof of my trust. He said that he had taken a house
on the river at Goring for the season, that he was making up a
house party, and that Captain Cunnyngham was to be one of the
guests. His special request was that my mother and I should spend a
week at Goring.</p>

<p>"I promised. I cannot say whether I was doing right or wrong,
but I promised. Mother and I go to Goring on the 1st--that is next
Thursday. And, Diana, now for your part in this comedy or tragedy,
for Heaven only knows which it will turn out. Sir Edward has sent
you a special invitation. It seems that he has met you in the house
of a mutual friend. Here is his invitation. You must accept it for
my sake."</p>

<p>She tossed a letter into my lap. I opened and read it. It ran as
follows:</p>

<p>DEAR MISS MARBURG, Unless you have already made definite plans
for your holiday, will you do me the honour of joining my house
party at Goring on the 1st? Your friend, Miss Trevor, will be
there. She is bringing you this note, and I hope will persuade you
to come.--Yours truly, EDWARD GRANVILLE.</p>

<p>"It is very kind of Sir Edward," I said, "but I scarcely know
him. What can be want me for?"</p>

<p>"Never mind what he wants you for, Di. Just remember that I want
you--that you may be of the most enormous use to me. Come you must.
You dare not leave me alone in my present predicament."</p>

<p>"I don't like it," I said, rising and beginning to pace up and
down the room. "I wonder you arranged to go. You don't consider
poor Captain Cunnyngham, when you allow yourself to be made love to
by another man in his presence."</p>

<p>"Sir Edward has promised not to make love. Don't be nasty and
spiteful, Di. Say at once that you will come."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the beautiful girl put her arms round my neck, and
looked into my face with such pleading in her eyes that it was
impossible to resist her.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll come," I answered. "I like you far too well to
leave you in the lurch."</p>

<p>"I knew you would not fail me," she exclaimed. "Now I shall be
quite happy, and shall be equal to the occasion, whatever it may
be."</p>

<p>A few moments later she left me, having arranged that she and
her mother would call for me on Thursday morning and drive me to
Paddington.</p>

<p>When we were alone, I told Rupert where I intended to spend the
first few days of my holidays.</p>

<p>"Do as you like of course, Di," was his answer; "but I wish you
were not going."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I would rather my sister did not stay in Sir Edward Granville's
house."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Only this," he said. "Granville is not the sort of man I care
about, though I have heard nothing defmite against him. Go now,
however, as you have promised, and tell me when you come back
whether my intuitions are correct or not."</p>

<p>Rupert's words gave me a vague sense of uneasiness; yet I was
glad I had promised not to desert Kate in this crisis in her
affairs.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday, Mrs. Trevor, Kate and I went down to
Goring. Our host met us at the station and gave us all a most
cordial welcome. As we drove to the house I watched Sir Edward with
considerable curiosity. I had met him before, but until now I had
no reason to feel any special interest in him. He was a
clean-shaven, spare-looking man, with restless grey eyes and a hard
mouth. It needed but a glance to show me that his was the character
to carry through his own wishes regardless of pain to others.</p>

<p>Almost by second nature, as these thoughts coursed through my
brain, I glanced at his hands, which were ungloved. I noticed the
long and broad thumb of an iron will--the spatulate fingers of
precision and determination. The man who has these characteristics
sticks at nothing to obtain his ends. I have seen them in the hands
of great generals and also in the hands of great criminals. I
looked from the baronet to Kate, who was talking in her liveliest
style and looking more sprightly and bewitching than I had ever
seen her.</p>

<p>As it was late in the day when we arrived, we were shown at once
to our respective rooms in order to dress for dinner. I had brought
my maid with me, and sat to rest for a few minutes while she
unpacked my things. In less than an hour I went down to one of the
big drawing-rooms, where from twenty to thirty guests were
assembled. Amongsx them I saw Kate, who, in a very simple white
dress with a bunch of lilies in her belt, looked fragile and
lovely.</p>

<p>She had the gracious bearing and regal appearance of a young
queen, and as she turned to talk to a man who stood near I did not
wonder at Sir Edward's infatuation. For something had brought the
final touch of beauty to those delicate features, and there was an
expression in her eyes which only love itself could awaken. The
softness joined to the fire, the timidity joined to the strength,
were enough to captivate any man, and Sir Edward, not far off, saw
this look directed to another man. I watched him although he did
not know it, and I saw him clench one of his hands tightly, while
his face turned livid.</p>

<p>Jim Cunnyngham was a young guardsman by profession. He was fair
and stalwart and squarely built. I knew him well, having met him
before on many occasions; but although at first sight he looked as
well and handsome as ever, I soon observed a change in him. Some
suspicious crow's feet were beginning to show round his merry blue
eyes, his face was thin, and when he was not looking at or talking
to Kate, he had the expression of one quite bowed down by care.</p>

<p>I sank into a seat, and my host came up and introduced me to one
or two people. Presently he brought Captain Cunnyngham to my
side.</p>

<p>"Will you take Miss Marburg in to dinner, Cunnyngham?" he
said.</p>

<p>The meal was announced, and we went through the library into the
spacious dining-room in a distant wing.</p>

<p>We were scarcely seated before Captain Cunnyngham bent towards
me.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," he said, "how glad I am that you are here.
Have you come with any intention of reading our hands?"</p>

<p>"I have come for rest, not on business," was my reply.</p>

<p>"All the same, I shall beg of you to have a look at my hand," he
said. "Your curious profession interests me."</p>

<p>"But have you any real belief in my art, or do you treat it as
an amusing pastime?" I said.</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I absolutely believe in palmistry," he said,
"but I have sufficient faith in it to treat it with respect, and
also to have recourse to it. A fortnight back I had my character
and future told me by one of your craft in London, and am anxious
to have an independent opinion to see if the two correspond."</p>

<p>"To whom did you go?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Madame Sylvia, in Chester-street."</p>

<p>"May I ask whether she gave you a good character or the
reverse?"</p>

<p>"I am quite willing to answer you," he replied, with a grim
laugh; "her prognostications were the reverse of pleasant. She
said, too, that my hands were most extraordinary; she photographed
them and had casts taken, and gave me a long written opinion. I
went to see her with Sir Edward. He, apparently, has the greatest
faith in her."</p>

<p>Sir Edward must have overheard the last words, for he bent
towards me from his place at the head of the table.</p>

<p>"I take the deepest interest in palmistry, Miss Marburg," he
said, "and if you will honour me by looking at my hand by-and-by I
shall be much obliged."</p>

<p>I replied gladly in the affirmative--I was all too anxious to
study Sir Edward's palm.</p>

<p>He resumed his conversation with his right hand neighbour, and I
turned to Captain Cunnyngham.</p>

<p>"Have any of Madame Sylvia's predictions come to pass?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sorry to say," he replied; "I had a very bad time
lately at Goodwood with Sir Edward, and other things have also gone
wrong," he added.</p>

<p>"You mean that you have lost money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, far more than I could afford. I owe at the present moment
between twenty-five and thirty thousand pounds, and how I am to pay
it, Heaven only knows. I backed Sir Edward's horse for the Cup. He
told me it was a certainty. I have lost heavily also at
<i>écarté</i>. You don't know, perhaps, that our host is himself a
confirmed gambler. But he is one of the lucky ones."</p>

<p>Captain Cunnyngham sighed. After a moment he said again:</p>

<p>"Luck follows his footsteps as certainly as it eludes mine. He
has great wealth, and is always adding to his possessions. And the
climax of his good luck, Miss Marburg, is--"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The winning of Kate Trevor."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," I said, "he has not won her."</p>

<p>"Watch her, and tell me that again," was his answer.</p>

<p>Sir Edward had been obliged to take a married lady into dinner,
but he had managed that Kate Trevor should sit on his other side.
He was looking at her now as he talked, and she was returning his
glance. Bright as stars were her eyes, and her merry laughter
reached our ears. Sir Edward was telling her about an ornament of
great value which he had in his possession, and I heard him say
that he would show it to the entire party after dinner.</p>

<p>When we returned to the drawing-room Kate made her way to my
side.</p>

<p>"Now tell me exactly what Jim has been talking to you about,"
she said.</p>

<p>"He said that Sir Edward Granville is invariably lucky," was my
answer, "and that amongst all the treasures which fate and fortune
have tumbled into his lap, the greatest of all will soon be
his."</p>

<p>She did not affect to misunderstand me--tears filled her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Does Jim really think that?" she said.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he does," I replied.</p>

<p>She was silent, the pretty white hand which lay on her white
dress trembled--with a sudden nervous movement she broke off one of
the lilies at her belt, and began to pull it to pieces.</p>

<p>"I heard you and Sir Edward talking about a jewel," I
interrupted--"a jewel or an ornament?"</p>

<p>"An ornament," she said--"a curious thing of great value which
Sir Edward has inherited from a gipsy ancestor. He told me that
since his great-grandfather married a true Romany the luck of his
house has been proverbial. She brought the ornament into the
family, and as long as the head of the house holds it he obtains
all he wishes in love, war, or business."</p>

<p>"But if it goes?" I said.</p>

<p>"Then he dies, goes bankrupt, or morally ruined."</p>

<p>"And does he believe this nonsense?" I queried.</p>

<p>"As much as you believe in the lines on the human hand," she
answered. "But, come, here is Sir Ed ward, and he has brought the
ornament with him."</p>

<p>Our host now stood in the centre of the great hall and held what
looked like a Maltese Cross in his hand. The ornament measured six
inches each way, and was a perfect blaze of diamonds and rubie.
None of the stones were particularly large, but their number was
bewildering.</p>

<p>Sir Edward looked around him, his eyes met mine, and he suddenly
to my surprise put the cross into my hand.</p>

<p>"You would like to examine it, Miss Marburg?" he said.</p>

<p>I looked carefully at the glittering and lovely thing.</p>

<p>"What is it worth?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Considerably over thirty thousand pounds," was his reply.</p>

<p>Then he added, dropping his voice, and speaking as if to me
alone, although Miss Trevor and Captain Cunningham heard every word
he uttered.</p>

<p>"The miracle is that I have kept this cross so long, for it has
a very special market value. One big stone is generally safe, for a
thief cannot well dispose of it; but if this were stolen it could
be easily broken up and the diamonds and rubies, none of them
specially large in themselves, could be disposed of separately. Now
I will return it to my safe in the library--but pray wait for me,
Miss Marburg, for I have a special favour to ask of you."</p>

<p>He was absent for about two minutes--when he returned he came to
my side.</p>

<p>"Will you give us a short <i>séance</i>?" he asked. "I beg for
this favour at the request of my guests."</p>

<p>I paused for a moment, then I said quietly:</p>

<p>"I will do so on a special condition--will you allow me to read
your hand first of all?"</p>

<p>He coloured, and I saw a look of annoyance in his eyes, but his
reply came quickly.</p>

<p>"With pleasure. May I conduct you to the library?"</p>

<p>I seated myself in a chair at the head of the room, and one by
one those who wished to consult me entered. Sir Edward was the
first. His hand bore out all my ideas with regard to his character.
There was obstinacy, which could amount to cruelty; there was a
passionate and absorbing selfishness; and, what gave grim
significance to those two qualities an overmastering sense of
superstition. I mumbled a few words in praise of what small virtues
he possessed, and as I saw that he was all too anxious to get the
ordeal over, quickly dismissed him.</p>

<p>One by one several of the visitors consulted me, and at last it
was Captain Cunnyngham's turn. I bent over his hand with great
interest. There was no question that the good qualities in it
largely predominated, but I was disappointed to perceive how a
certain weakness of character in his face was repeated in his hand.
I gave him as fair an estimate as I could of his better qualities,
and he left me with a smile of satisfaction on his face. Poor
fellow! I pitied him from the bottom of my heart. Beyond doubt he
was in Sir Edward's power, and Sir Edward could be cruel to gain
his ends.</p>

<p>On the following morning but one I had an insight into the true
motive of this house party. Kate Trevor, Captain Cunnyngham, and I
had not been invited to meet together in Sir Edward's house without
a very definite reason.</p>

<p>The morning in question happened to be a glorious one, and I
awoke earlier than usual. I determined to get up and have a stroll
by the river's bank before breakfast. Accordingly I rang for my
maid, Parker. It was a few moments before she appeared. When she
entered the room, her usually placid face was blazing with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, miss!" she cried, "such a dreadful thing has happened in
the night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I answered.</p>

<p>"The house has been broken into, miss, and Sir Edward
Granville's diamond and ruby cross has been stolen."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I exclaimed. "Why, he keeps it in a safe, which is
supposed to be burglar-proof."</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, but the safe was opened in the night and the cross
taken. None of the other jewels or plate were touched. For that
matter, Sir Edward hadn't much down here. The cross is gone,
however, and they say it takes the family luck away with it--Sir
Edward is almost off his head."</p>

<p>"How was the theft discovered?"</p>

<p>"The butler thought he heard footsteps early this morning, miss,
and he went to arouse Sir Edward, but when they got to the library
it was too late, for Sir Edward's desk was broken open, and also
the tin box where he keeps the keys of the safe. The safe has been
burgled and the thief has escaped."</p>

<p>"Is it known how he got in?"</p>

<p>"That's the strange thing, miss, for neither doors nor windows,
as far as we can tell, have been touched. The notion is that
someone in the house has done it--but who, is the question. Sir
Edward has telegraphed for detectives to Scotland Yard. I never saw
a gentleman in such a state. Fit to tear his hair, he is; the local
police are with him now."</p>

<p>I hastily dressed and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Several of the guests were standing about in differenc groups in
the hall. Our host was nowhere to be seen. The subject of the
robbery was the one topic on everyone's lips.</p>

<p>Who could have done it? and how was it done? were the problems
which riveted the attention of each of us at this moment. Presently
a door to our right opened, and Sir Edward, accompanied by a police
inspector, joined us.</p>

<p>"My dear friends," he said, "you must not let my loss make you
all miserable. Do go out and enjoy yourselves. Breakfast will be
ready presently."</p>

<p>"But what steps do you propose to take, Sir Edward?" said an
elderly gentleman now coming forward. His name was General
Raglan.</p>

<p>"I have sent for detectives from Scotland Yard," was Sir
Edward's answer. "Until they arrive nothing can really be
done."</p>

<p>"When do you expect them?"</p>

<p>"Probably between nine and ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Then," said General Raglan, glancing round at us all, "I think
I speak in the names of everyone present. We should like to be in
the house when your detectives arrive--in order to give the police
all the help in our power towards the elucidation of this
mystery."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, General Raglan," said Sir
Edward, a look of relief stealing over his face. "I did not like to
ask you, but it will be best for all of us to have the matter
properly investigated."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I have informed Sir Edward," said the
police inspector, now speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>Shortly before ten o'clock the London detective arrived, and at
General Raglan's suggestion we all assembled in the hall. We stood
about there in groups, and I found myself not far from Captain
Cunnyngham. His face was pale and he looked strangely nervous. Once
he came close to me and glanced at me as if about to say something,
but the next instant he turned aside, evidently unable to disclose
what troubled him. His depression was remarked by more than one
person present, but strange to say Kate Trevor did not seem to
notice it.</p>

<p>Kate was in wonderfully good spirits. There were spots of vivid
colour on her cheeks caused by the excitement of the hour. She
laughed and talked merrily, and was eager in her conjectures with
regard to the nature of the burglary. I saw Captain Cunnyngham
glance at her once or twice in surprise, and I must own that her
manner troubled me not a little. But after watching her closely, I
came to the conclusion that a great deal of her riotous spirits was
put on, and that in reality she felt as strangely nervous as the
rest of us.</p>

<p>In about half-an-hour Sir Edward joined us. He walked quickly
through the hall, and stood on a raised platform at one end. His
face looked hard and white, and I never liked his expression
less.</p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry, ladies and gentlemen," he said, in a loud
voice, "that this most unfortunate affair has happened while you
are my guests. It is very kind of you to assemble here to listen to
what I have got to say. Inspector Fawcett from Scotland Yard has
been with me for the last half hour, and, with the aid of the local
police, we have gone most carefully into the matter.</p>

<p>"The inspector and the police have arrived at the unanimous
conclusion that the robbery has been effected by some person in the
house, or at least by some person in collusion with someone
outside. This is abundantly proved by the fact that no windows or
doors have been tampered with, that there are no footmarks on the
soft grass outside, that there is not the slightest sign of
disturbance in any of these directions.</p>

<p>"By a lucky chance Inspector Fawcett has discovered a clue, and
this clue he wishes to put to the test at once. Now, ladies and
gentlemen, I am put into a most unpleasant predicament. Inspector
Fawcett cannot put his clue to the test without your collaboration.
But if you refuse to help me I have not a word to say."</p>

<p>"We will help you," said General Raglan. "I speak, I am sure, in
the names of everyone present?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," echoed each voice in the hall.</p>

<p>Sir Edward bowed.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "the matter is of great importance to me,
and I should like the clue so miraculously afforded to be brought
to its just conclusion."</p>

<p>"What is the clue?" asked General Raglan.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. Yesterday afternoon a painter came here to
varnish a cabinet in which I keep the billiard balls. This cabinet
was put into a cupboard in order not to be used until it was dry.
To my certain knowledge no one entered the cupboard between the
time when the painter returned me the key and the time of the
burglary. At three o'clock this morning my butler drew my attention
to the cupboard door. I found that the lock had been forced, and
the thief, who had previously broken open my desk and also the tin
box where I keep the key of the safe, had entered, opened the safe,
and removed the diamond pendant. Having committed the theft, he
returned the key to the tin box, which he locked, but he was unable
to lock the desk or the door of the cupboard, having no keys for
the purpose.</p>

<p>"Now, pray listen. By a remarkable chance it has just been
discovered that the thief on entering the cupboard, must have bent
down to open the safe, and in doing this rested his hand upon one
of the knobs of the newly-varnished cabinet, and, the varnish not
being dry, <i>an impression of the palm of his hand</i> has been
left upon it."</p>

<p>An audible murmur of sensation ran through the group as Sir
Edward made this startling disclosure.</p>

<p>"I have had the knob removed," he continued, "it is now in the
possession of Inspector Fawcett. The request I have to make is that
each person will in turn go into the library and submit his or her
hand to Inspector Fawcett for comparison with the impression on the
knob. The same ordeal I shall ask my servants to submit to. I have
one thing further to say. Among my guests there is a lady who is
specially skilled in the marks of the hand. Miss Marburg, by
Inspector Fawcett's request, I have to ask you if you will kindly
give your services in the impending examination?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir Edward," I replied.</p>

<p>"We will all gladly submit our hands for examination," said a
gentleman present.</p>

<p>The London detective now motioned me to follow him, and the
three police officers and I entered the library, and closed the
door.</p>

<p>Inspector Fawcett showed me the newly-varnished wooden knob,
holding it carefully in his hand as I gazed at it.</p>

<p>The next moment I could have screamed aloud, for the impression
of the hand which I looked at I instantly recognised. I knew the
markings of the human hand too well to have the least doubt. I was
gazing at the reverse impression of the left hand of Captain
Cunnyngham, which I had studied so carefully two nights before.</p>

<p>"Do you recognise this impression, Miss Marburg?" said Inspector
Fawcett, looking me full in the face.</p>

<p>"I do," I replied instantly, "but if you proceed with the
examination you will quickly discover it for yourself."</p>

<p>"You will not say any more?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "nothing more at present."</p>

<p>He bowed to me, and then proceeded quickly with his
examination.</p>

<p>One by one the visitors filed into the library, one by one their
hands were compared with the impression of the hand on the
knob--they then retired again. At last it was Captain Cunnyngham's
turn. His face was very white, but he entered the room with a firm
and steady step. His eyes met mine--something in the expression of
my face must have put him on his guard. He looked full at the
detective.</p>

<p>"Before you put my hand to the test," he said, "I wish to tell
you that I know absolutely nothing of this matter."</p>

<p>Detective Fawcett gave him a quick glance, then looked at me,
and then went through the usual examination.</p>

<p>"Will you, Miss Marburg," he said, "give your careful
attention?"</p>

<p>We both bent over the Captain's hand, looking carefully at the
lines. One by one they corresponded with those on the wooden
knob.</p>

<p>"There is no question, sir, that the lines on the knob and the
lines in your hand correspond exactly," said the detective. "Is not
that your opinion, Miss Marburg?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say it is," I answered. "It is not within the
bounds of possibility that any other hand could have made the
impression which we are now looking at. Line for line, mount for
mount, everything precisely corresponds."</p>

<p>"It is enough evidence for my purpose," said the detective.
"Captain Cunnyngham, it is my painful duty to ask Sir Edward
Granville to give you in charge for breaking open this safe and
stealing the diamond and ruby pendant."</p>

<p>Captain Cunnyngham reeled against the wall as the man said these
words. It was just as if someone had struck him a physical blow. He
did not utter a word, nor attempt to defend himself.</p>

<p>The impression on the knob was horrible in its perfect
clearness--the palm of the hand was absolutely distinct.</p>

<p>Inspector Fawcett, who seemed intensely interested, now held the
knob in the same position in which it was when on the cabinet, in
order to see as far as possible how the thief had held it in order
to get the necessary impression. As he did so, the light fell full
on the cabinet and I started forward. I saw for the first time
something else. This was none other than the clear impression of
four finger-tips on the varnished surface of the cabinet just
beyond the knob. These finger-tips revealed the exact minutiae of
the skin ridges.</p>

<p>I felt myself turning pale as I noticed them, for I saw that, by
leaving these marks of the finger-tips, poor Captain Cunnyngham had
doubly convicted himself of the crime; as surely, in fact, as if he
had confessed it fully. I remembered Professor Galton's well-known
and exhaustive researches on finger-prints, the fact which he has
abundantly proved being that no two persons in the world have the
same skin ridges, and also that these ridges never alter in the
most remote degree, except in growth, from babyhood to old age. The
evidential value of these skin ridges is so great that where they
are brought into requisition no escape is possible. Beyond doubt,
the finger tips on the varnish would settle the matter at once
without further discussion, and I felt forced to draw the
detective's attention to them.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"That is true," he said. "These marks will of course clinch the
matter. They are most important evidence."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "for my own satisfaction will you kindly allow
me to take an impression of Captain Cunnyngham's finger tips and
compare them with those marked on the cabinet?"</p>

<p>"There is no objection," was the answer.</p>

<p>In a few moments I had melted a square bar of sealing-wax and
taken an impression of the finger tips of Jim Cunnyngham's left
hand, the hand in question.</p>

<p>"Give me one moment while I make a cursory exammation," I said,
and, taking out my lens, I began to focus first one finger tip and
then the other, and finally to examine the impression on the
varnish.</p>

<p>The next instant I uttered a cry, and seizing Captain Cunnyngham
by the hand, began wringing it in an esctasy of delight, for I
could not find words to express myself coherently at the moment.
Both the Captain and Inspector Fawcett must have thought that I had
suddenly gone mad.</p>

<p>"Cleared, acquitted, free!" I almost shouted. "The
correspondence of the palm is nothing when we have got this. By
what means, or by what hand that impression was made, it is
absolutely certain that it is not yours--certain beyond all
possibility of doubt--and what is far more important, we have a
clue to the identity of the real man, to an absolute certainty, for
he has left on that cabinet a sign manual that will differentiate
him from every other human being at this moment living on our
planet."</p>

<p>As I uttered these words I looked up. Sir Edward Granville had
entered the room. He had evidently been startled by hearing my loud
and excited tones.</p>

<p>Inspector Fawcett was now closely comparing the finger
prints.</p>

<p>"What is all this excitement about, Inspector?" asked Sir
Edward.</p>

<p>"A very queer business, I am afraid, sir. There has been some
deep game played somewhere. The impression on this varnish
corresponds exactly with this gentleman's hand as far as the palm
goes, but the finger tips don't fit."</p>

<p>"The finger tips!" cried the baronet. "What do you mean, Miss
Marburg? What are you all talking about? There are no lines on the
fmger tips."</p>

<p>"Oh, aren't there, Sir Edward?" I said, trembling with
excitement as a fantastic thought flashed through my brain. "Let me
show, you." And I held the sealing wax once more in the flame.
"Kindly press the top of your middle finger on the wax, Sir Edward,
and I will explain it to you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he cried angrily, drawing back. "What does this
mean? Are you mad, Miss Marburg?"</p>

<p>"Mad or sane, I should like you to do it. Inspector Fawcett,
will you request Sir Edward to give us the impression of one of his
finger tips in this wax?"</p>

<p>"You had better do it, Sir Edward. What the young lady says is
quite true. It will be on these finger tips that the evidence will
turn. They are the important things, and I shall be obliged to get
the impression of all the finger tips of the people at present
residing in this house."</p>

<p>"Please give us yours first, Sir Edward," I said, once more
warming the wax.</p>

<p>"It is necessary that it should be done, Sir Edward," said the
Inspector. "The lack of correspondence between the impression of
the palm and the finger tips on the varnish proves that either
Captain Cunnynham had someone else's finger tips, or that someone
else had Captain Cunnynham's palm. Now to counterfeit a palm is
comparatively easy by reproduction in india-rubber from a cast--to
counterfeit the skin ridges is next door to impossible. The
deduction therefore is that someone wished to have Captain
Cunnyngham accused of the crime and has counterfeited his palm
knowing nothing of the infinitely more important evidential value
of finger tips."</p>

<p>"By the way," added the man, turning suddenly to Jim Cunnyngham,
"have you ever had a cast taken of your hand?"</p>

<p>"About a month ago in London," was the immediate answer.</p>

<p>"Ah! by whom?"</p>

<p>"Madame Sylvia of Bond Street."</p>

<p>The detective turned to Sir Edward.</p>

<p>"You may as well be the first to have your fingers printed, as
you are here," he said.</p>

<p>The baronet instantly obeyed, and as he made the impression on
the wax, I saw the three police officers exchange significant
glances. They knew quite as well as I did, that they were in the
presence of the guilty man.</p>

<p>"Now," said the detective, "we will proceed with the
others."</p>

<p>He went to the door which led into the hall as he spoke, and
asked General Raglan to come forward. A few words were sufficient
to put the General in possession of the new and startling facts
which were now before us.</p>

<p>One by one the guests, in a state of great excitement, appeared,
and each and all submitted to the new test. Kate Trevor was the
last to have the impression of her fingers taken. The detective
cleared his throat and looked around him. He asked me to come
forward and in silence I looked at the different impressions.</p>

<p>The last of all to be examined was that of Sir Edward Granville,
the cores of whose finger tips corresponded exactly ridge by ridge
even to the most remote and minute particulars with the impression
made on the varnish.</p>

<p>I stood back in silence. The detective and I exchanged one
glance.</p>

<p>"Will you explain?" he said to me.</p>

<p>I tried to speak, but no words would come.</p>

<p>"Then I will do it," he said. But before he could speak, Sir
Edward Granville came forward. He pushed the detective aside and
stood facing his guests.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "it is unnecessary for
Inspector Fawcett to explain himself. The news you have to learn
can be communicated in a few words. You see before you in the
person of your host the guilty man. Why I concocted so desperate a
scheme, and why at the last moment, by the most unlooked-for
fatality, my guilt has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt, is not
for me now to explain, nor will I enter into all my motives for
this action. You will, doubtless, none of you, wish any longer to
be my guests; carriages will therefore be ready to convey you to
the railway station in an hour. I have now but one thing to do, and
that is to congratulate Miss Marburg on her marvellous detective
abilities."</p>

<p>As he spoke he bowed to me, and turning, without another word,
left the library.</p>

<p>Then Sir Edward's guests found their tongues. What they said,
how much they wondered is not for me to say.</p>

<p>But I have the happiness to relate that this story aroused such
an interest in the fortunes of Captain Cunnyngham that several
members of that strange house party put their heads together, and
between them managed to extricate the young guardsman from his
difficulties. Early in the following spring I had the happiness of
seeing Kate Trevor united to the man she loved.</p>
