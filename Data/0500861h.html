    <h2>
      <a name="c01" id="c01">CHAPTER 1</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first Tuesday in August. The Nebraska heat
      rolled in upon one like the engulfing waves of a dry
      sea,--a thick material substance against which one seemed
      to push when moving about. Two women, standing by the back
      porch of a house in the north end of Cedartown, commented
      wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awful."
    </p>
    <p>
      The one, gingerly holding between her thumb and forefinger
      an egg which she had borrowed from the other, made feeble
      attempts to pull herself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too hot to bake. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll say."
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interim of dull silence, she effected the
      threatened withdrawal, and started down the path toward her
      home. But she had not gone a dozen feet until she stopped,
      turned back, and called to the other in the low mysterious
      tones of the chronic tale-bearer: "For the land sakes! Look
      there. There goes Laura Deal. I do believe she's goin' over
      to her grandmother's house the same as she always did."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other, in equally semi-excited voice (it takes
      little to bring on an animated conversation in the north
      ends of the Cedartowns of the country): "Yes, sir! She is.
      Did you ever! And her grandmother just buried day before
      yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the two stood watching the young girl pass by
      and down the elm-shaded road, but when she approached the
      gate of the house to the north and turned toward it, they
      were looking discreetly at a petunia bed. Their
      conversation, however, was not of those funnel-shaped
      blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's turnin' in the little gate and goin' up the path
      between the cedars. Do you suppose she's goin' <i>in</i>
      the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word, I believe she is. And they ain't a soul there
      . . . not a soul. Christine Reinmueller even took the cat
      home with her when she come over to feed the chickens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That twelve-year-old girl . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . is the oddest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd think she'd kind of . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . at her age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just day before yesterday . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . <i>buried."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither one made a complete sentence nor waited for the
      other to speak. Their conversation was rather a duet, the
      parts similar and in perfect rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's got the key . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . all by herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, on my soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . kind of spooky."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Deal, having unlocked the side door of the old house
      behind the cedars and disappeared from view, the two
      loitered expectantly for a time; but when she did not
      reappear, they reluctantly returned to their labors, with
      special attention to the sweeping of east porches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura softly opened the side door of her dead grandmother's
      house, stepped in, closed the door gently, and stood with
      her back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot afternoon sunshine lay in long streaks across the
      floor of the sitting-room with the cross shadows of the
      window-casings in them. There was a faint odor of flowers
      in the air--roses and tube-roses and the cinnamon-like odor
      of carnations. It was deathly still. A fly bumbling against
      the pane with little bumping noises was the only sound in
      the house. The clock was not even ticking. Everything was
      just as Grandma Deal had left it. The old chintz-covered
      couch in one corner had Grandma's shawl folded neatly over
      the back. The rocking-chairs were in their places. A little
      square stand with a red spread on it held the church papers
      and seed catalogues and an old song book, and on the mantel
      shelf were the two flowered vases and the turkey-feather
      fan. Not a thing looked different. Everything seemed just
      as it had the week before when Grandma was going in and
      out, putting away the eggs and washing her dishes and
      sorting poppy seed into paper folders. On Friday morning
      she had done all her work and called them up on the
      telephone. In the afternoon she had visited with the
      grocery boy and called to Mrs. Johnson to come over and get
      some turnips any time she wanted them. Mrs. Curtis had seen
      her reading the newspaper on the screened porch--and then
      when old Christine Reinmueller had come over about supper
      time, she was gone. <i>Gone. Gone where?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven, of course, for Grandma was the best person that
      ever lived. But where was Heaven? And how could you go?
      Miss Bliss, her Sunday School teacher, said it was beyond
      all the worlds. She couldn't comprehend that distance. Miss
      Sherwin, a friend of her mother's, said it was here and now
      within one. That was still harder to believe. Grandma
      wasn't <i>here,</i> so why did they try to tell you that?
    </p>
    <p>
      But in one way Grandma didn't seem to have gone away at
      all. That was the queerest thing. She could summon Grandma
      into her mind just as clearly as though she were standing
      over there by the table,--small, shrunken, shoulders
      rounded, a little white knot of hair at the nape of her
      neck, wrinkled face, bright brown eyes, slender hands,
      veined and trembling, with queer brown spots on them, and
      long tapering fingers twisted a little with rheumatism.
      Just last week Grandma had stood right by that table and
      laughed about a funny thing Christine Reinmueller had
      said--Grandma could laugh so heartily. It almost seemed
      that if she would call her now, Grandma would just walk in
      from the kitchen and--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grandma," she called softly, scarcely above a whisper. Her
      heart beat rapidly at the sound of her own voice in the
      stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only a great silence, deep and unfathomable--the
      same vast quiet that has confronted all humanity--that
      always will confront it, until one by one each hears a
      voice in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments longer Laura stood rigidly with her back
      to the door. Then she moved quietly over to the bedroom and
      looked in. This was the room where old Christine
      Reinmueller had found her--over there lying across the foot
      of the bed. She had been all alone. Every one of Grandma's
      children had felt so troubled that she died alone. They all
      talked about it a great deal--her own father, and Uncle
      Mack, Aunt Margaret and Aunt Isabelle and Aunt Grace. It
      worried them all the time as though the being alone was the
      sad thing. That wasn't the sad part. Why did they think so?
      To die with no one else looking on at you--that was the
      best way. Just doing it yourself. You had to do it by
      yourself anyway. Nobody could help you do it. You'd
      <i>rather</i> do it by yourself maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the bedroom, looked about her a moment, then
      carefully opened the wardrobe doors. Grandpa Deal had made
      the heavy old piece of furniture for Grandma years and
      years before. It was walnut, and the two had planted the
      trees from which the lumber was sawed. Grandma's things
      were hanging limply on the hooks,--the black silk and the
      second best silk and the house dresses. It gave her a queer
      feeling to see them. The new lavender silk wasn't there.
      Grandma had it on the other day when--when she was taken to
      the church and cemetery. Aunt Emma Deal had brought it down
      from Omaha two weeks before for Grandma to wear to Cousin
      Katherine's wedding,--the dress and a lace cape collar from
      Vienna. Did you wear the things that people put on you
      right up to Heaven? If you did, Grandma wouldn't feel very
      comfortable in the presence of God,--Grandma would have
      felt more like herself in the second best with a plain
      white fichu. She could scarcely remember how Grandma looked
      in the strange lavender and lace, but she could see her
      just as plain as day in the second best and the white fichu
      with her cameo pinning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half enjoying herself in an emotional way. There
      was sort of a gruesome ecstasy in making herself sad with
      memories. She would like to write about it. "The girl moved
      about from room to room, touching the things lovingly" went
      through her mind. She was in one of those familiar moods
      when she looked upon life in a detached way as though she
      herself were not a part of it. She could never talk to any
      one about it, but in some vague way she felt withdrawn from
      the world. She lived with people, but she was not one of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the old sewing-machine and the little red
      pincushion on it, bristling with black and white pins like
      a variegated porcupine. Queer, how things lasted longer
      than people. To-morrow the house was to be dismantled.
      Tomorrow Aunt Margaret and Aunt Isabelle and Aunt Grace
      were all coming to divide the things. It seemed a horrible
      plan,--to talk of separating the old things. They ought to
      be left together. She wondered if they would miss each
      other after nearly sixty years of standing side by side.
      How could the sewing-machine get along without the little
      red pincushion? Or the blue flowered vases without the
      turkey fan?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Isabelle had said she wanted this tallow lamp. It was
      a queer old thing, with the wick hanging out like a tongue.
      Grandma had told her it once hung in <i>her</i>
      Grandmother's house, an Irish peasant's hut among the whins
      and silver hazels of Bally-poreen. She loved the musical
      sound of those words, and said them over: "the whins and
      silver hazels of Bally-poreen."
    </p>
    <p>
      From under the bed she drew out a little calf-skin-covered
      box with the initials M.O.C. on it in brass nail heads.
      This was the one thing she wanted,--this and Grandma's
      scrap-book. To-morrow when they divided the things, she was
      going to say right out at the start that Grandma had
      promised those to her. She sat down on the floor and pulled
      the little trunk into her lap and thought of all that
      Grandma had told her about it; how Grandma's mother, Maggie
      O'Conner, an Irish peasant girl, had taken it with her to
      the big estate in Scotland when she married Basil
      Mackenzie. Basil's mother, a grand lady, Isabelle
      Anders-Mackenzie, had given her little Irish
      daughter-in-law a white silk shawl and a jeweled fan and a
      breastpin and a string of pearls, and she had brought them
      all to America in this very box. When she had given the
      things away to her daughters, the pearls had come to
      Grandma. And now only two weeks ago, when Cousin Katherine
      Deal was married, Grandma had given Kathie the pearls. She
      felt no jealousy about Katherine owning the pearls. She did
      not care for jewelry and wanted only the funny little hairy
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shoved the box back under the bed and went out to the
      kitchen. It was clean and neat and very quiet out there.
      The old Seth Thomas clock stood silently there with its
      little brown church painted on the glass. She had heard
      them talking about it,--how strange it was that it had
      happened. Several old ladies said it often happened. There
      it was, showing fourteen minutes of six. And Christine
      Reinmueller had found her about half-past six. The doctor
      said she had been dead less than an hour. So it must be
      true--<i>clocks stopped when people died.</i> How did they
      know to stop? Grandma had brought the clock into Nebraska
      in the covered wagon--sixty years before--and to-morrow the
      house would be dismantled, and the clock and all the other
      things that had lived together so long would be divided.
      The house would be empty, for Herman Rinemiller's hired man
      was going to move here.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ought to be going now for she had been here for quite a
      while. The sun was lower and it was almost supper time. She
      walked over to the door and turned back to the rooms. She
      could imagine how this would be in writing: "The girl
      hesitated at the door, at a loss to know how to proceed."
      She said aloud, "Good-by, little house." She threw out her
      hands in dramatic gesture. "Good-by to all the days that
      have gone by, and all the Christmases here and all the
      birthdays . . ." She loved the sad emotion which she was
      feeling. She would write a poem about it as soon as she got
      home. It would begin:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The little house held its memories . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would enjoy doing it. And when it was finished she
      would read it to--
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, no,--how terrible--there was no Grandma to read it to.
      She had completely forgotten for a minute and was planning
      to bring it here and read it to Grandma. Oh, no, no! For
      the first time the tears broke,--wild, uncontrollable
      little-girl tears. She could not stand it,--not to have
      Grandma here to talk things over with and read things to.
      Nobody else cared about her writing,--no one in the world
      understood it but Grandma and herself. She always read
      everything to Grandma. And Grandma would never listen
      again. There was no one, then. She was shaken with grief
      and threw herself down on the old chintz-covered couch.
      Great engulfing sobs tore at her sturdy little body and she
      moaned aloud. This was her real self,--the real Laura
      Deal,--not that other queer person who dominated her, who
      felt emotions play about her as a swimmer feels the waves.
      This was the first time Grandma's death seemed really to
      have happened. She had witnessed the sorrow of all the
      relatives but she herself hadn't seemed to comprehend it
      before. And now she did. Grandma was gone--<i>forever.</i>
      There was no one to take her place. No one else to turn to.
      No one else understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed and cried again in the loneliness she had just
      realized was hers. She wished she could talk to some one
      about it. But no one would understand. Only Grandma herself
      would understand. She wished she could talk to Grandma
      herself about it. How queer! To want to talk to Grandma
      herself about Grandma's own death. But it wasn't just the
      fact that Grandma had died that made her feel so terrible.
      She could even imagine having a good time without Grandma.
      It was something else,--something strange that only they
      two knew about,--some great desire in life that just they
      two had,--some vision,--some longing that none of the other
      Deals had,--<i>to write lovely things.</i> Only Grandma
      understood it and now Grandma was gone. If Grandma could
      only come back to talk to her about it,--Grandma always
      knew such comforting things to say. Suddenly she sat up.
      She wiped her swollen eyes, and when vision was clear
      again, went over to the square stand, pulled out the
      scrapbook, took it back to the couch and began turning the
      pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma had always cut out everything she especially liked
      and pasted it in this big catalogue. She turned the
      familiar pages. The first of the old articles were brown
      with age, cut from newspapers of the past. A conglomerate
      collection of things they made,--poems and obituaries, news
      items of the Deal clan and bits of sermons. Grandma had
      pasted them all in neatly with home-made flour paste. There
      was the death of Grandma's mother,--Mrs. Maggie O'Conner
      Mackenzie, who "died far from her native land,"--patriotic
      verses, letters from Laura's father when he was in Alaska
      and printed at Grandma's prideful request in the local
      newspaper, an account of the death of Grandma's husband
      with a crude water-colored border of everlastings around it
      in neat cramped design, and more verses from newspapers and
      magazines. But these were not what she wanted. She was
      wondering what things Grandma had recently pasted in the
      old book, so she hurried over the pages and came
      immediately to the last work that had been done. There was
      no mistaking it, for the verse stood out clear and clean on
      a new page, the wrinkled clipping scarcely dry from its
      pasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It said:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Pain has been and grief enough and bitterness and
      crying,<br>
      Sharp ways and stony ways I think it was she trod,<br>
      But all there is to see now is a white bird flying.<br>
      Whose blood-stained wings go circling high,--circling up to
      God.*
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      * Margaret Widdemer.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She read it through twice, her heart beating fast in
      response to the attractiveness of it. She and Grandma
      always liked the same things. Grandma had found it in a
      magazine, loved it, and evidently saved it for her to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, the rhythm and exquisite loveliness of the
      thought caught and held her emotions. She thrilled to the
      lilting symmetry of it and the sadness of its beauty.
      Nimble in committing verse, already she could say it
      without looking. The line that captured and held her fancy
      the most was the third one:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      But all there is to see is a white bird flying.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A white bird flying!</i> That was like Grandma's death.
      Nothing was left to her now of Grandma,--nothing remained
      of Grandma's love and sympathy, of the dreams and desires
      Grandma held for her,--nothing but the memory. No one else
      had understood her so thoroughly, had liked the same things
      so well, had talked to her as Grandma had,--not her own
      mother, nor her father, nor a single one of the Deal
      relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subjects she and Grandma had talked about
      together,--the dreams they had for her future, the desires
      that life would give her some of the things Grandma had
      missed,--could never be talked over again. For Grandma was
      gone. And all there was to see now was a white bird flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though Grandma had left her a message,--as though
      Grandma, in going away, had not taken the lovely strange
      desire with her. She felt a vague sensation of relief and
      comfort. Grief no longer seemed tearing at her very soul
      and body. She would never tell any one about it,--no one
      would understand,--but in some unexplainable way everything
      was just as it had been before Grandma died,--all the
      dreams and desires were still there, all the vague
      yearnings for something fine and big in life. <i>A white
      bird flying.</i> That was what Grandma had left her. Well,
      she would always see it--always keep her eyes on the sheen
      of its silver wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the book back under the little stand, slipped
      quietly out of the side door, locked it and put the key in
      her pocket. She walked quickly down the path between the
      cedars, turned west on the grassy path toward the setting
      sun, averting her head when she passed Mrs. Johnson and
      Mrs. Curtis so they would not see her red eyes, and came
      then to the paved street that led south and toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went into the house, her father and mother, her
      brothers, Wentworth and Millard, and her visiting Aunt
      Grace were all getting up from the supper table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laura Deal, <i>where</i> have you been?" It was Eloise
      Deal, her mother, exasperated and worried. "I phoned
      Kathie's and two or three other places, and even ran over
      to old Oscar Lutz's. You ought to be more thoughtful than
      to worry us after all we've been through with Grandma's
      death. She ought not to do a thoughtless thing like that to
      worry me, had she, John?" Eloise always picked a subject to
      pieces, squeezed the parts dry and then put them together
      again. "I always tried to teach you children to be
      considerate of me and your father and of each other. And it
      isn't considerate just to disappear at supper time. The
      worry itself of where you are is bad enough, to say nothing
      of your not helping. First, I was afraid you were at
      Katherine's bothering just when she's beginning to settle
      her new house, and when I found you weren't there, I hardly
      knew where to think you were, now that Grandma's gone."
      Having practically exhausted the various ramifications of
      the subject, Eloise fell back on the initial question:
      <i>"Where</i> were you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Deal stood by the chair he had just vacated, silently
      regarding his young daughter. Wentworth frowned with the
      critical displeasure of twenty-one for errant twelve.
      Millard grinned with the malicious satisfied glee of eight
      that temporarily he was not as other men. Aunt Grace looked
      on accusingly with her most austere expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura averted her head. The painful flush of embarrassment
      flooded her face, so that her eyes, already swollen, felt
      hot and bursting.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could she tell them? How could they understand? How
      could she explain that she had been on a long emotional
      journey and back again? How could this energetic, efficient
      mother without imagination, this grim, silent father with
      the burdens of the whole community on his shoulders, and
      this stern uncompromising teacher-aunt, comprehend or
      sympathize? How could they know that a little girl, with a
      head full of fancies and a heart full of longing, had
      climbed a ladder reaching from the depths of a grave to the
      top of high heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to them all:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went for a long walk . . . out by Grandma's old house."
    </p>
    <p>
      How could they see <i>a white bird flying?</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="c02" id="c02">CHAPTER 2</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Deal's old home behind the cedars was
      dismantled, with every one hot and hurried and uncertain
      what to do with things. Margaret Deal Baker, wife of Dr.
      Frederick Baker of Lincoln, and Isabelle Deal Rhodes, the
      singer from Chicago, were there. Grace Deal, the University
      teacher, was there. Eloise, Laura and Millard went out to
      the house in the morning. Mackenzie Deal, the Omaha banker,
      and Emma, his wife, drove down in the late afternoon. John
      Deal, Laura's father, came when he had closed his law
      office. Katherine Deal Buchanan, Mack's and Emma's
      daughter, a bride of two weeks, drove over in her sport
      roadster, although there was practically nothing she
      wanted, the old things giving no promise of fitting in the
      smart new English cottage with any degree of artistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, the daughters and daughters-in-law were a
      bit red-eyed and tearful. At the first sight of her
      mother's clothes in the old walnut wardrobe, Margaret Baker
      thought she could not go on with her sorrowful task.
      Isabelle Rhodes had a bad moment or two as she took down
      the recipe books and saw her mother's cramped handwriting.
      The rather austere Grace broke down when she took the
      glasses off the old Bible in the bedroom and put them in
      the case. It was almost as hard for Emma and Eloise, the
      daughters-in-law. Mother Deal had been good to them. Mack
      and John tramped around out doors, taking down tools that
      had been their father's and, uncertain what to do, with
      masculine helplessness, put them all back again. Katherine
      sat on the kitchen table with the declivity in one corner
      in which old Doc Matthews had rolled pills in Civil War
      times, swung her chic-looking feet and, to keep the tears
      back, made snappy remarks about the dismantling. Millard
      ran in and out, with Eloise calling: "Millard Deal, do stay
      <i>in</i> or <i>out</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very confusing, and very strange, with the
      familiar things in a queer rearrangement, clustered
      together in piles on the floor. Laura went in and out of
      the rooms with something tearing a little at her heart
      every time an article was taken from its old place. Once
      she took the red pincushion from a pile and placed it back
      on the sewing-machine, and once she surreptitiously slipped
      the turkey-feather fan into a blue flowered vase. She could
      think of nothing but that Grandma was looking on and
      saying: "You'd better let Annie Johnson have the cape. She
      could make it over for Dottie." Or, "Tell Mrs. Curtis she
      can have the geraniums." Yes, that was just what Grandma
      would have said. It seemed queer to think she could almost
      hear her. How could it be? Because all the Deals were there
      together, it seemed that Grandma was there, too. How could
      some one who was dead live on and move among them just as
      she had always done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything seemed as natural as though nothing had
      happened. After the first few attempts to stop the tears
      and keep from breaking down, the whole clan grew brisk and
      talkative. In the stress of sorting and making disposition
      of things the conversation became practical and cheerful.
      After awhile they even began the old joking way of the
      Deals. Katherine laughed gayly and made extravagant
      statements about the old-fashioned clothes which her mother
      was unearthing in bundles from a closet shelf. Aunt
      Margaret and Aunt Isabelle even staged a well-bred but
      intensive argument over which one could have the old tallow
      lamp with the wick hanging over the side like a dog's
      tongue hanging out of his mouth. Life always closes over
      the vacancy and goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine Reinmueller, Grandma's neighbor and friend for
      sixty years, came over, her blue calico dress gathered on
      full at the place where her waistline should have been, her
      colorless hair braided in moist flat strands and wound from
      ear to ear, like a miniature braided rug that had been
      pinned on the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Ach</i> . . . <i>solch ein aufbrechen</i> . . . such a
      splitting . . . breaking up . . ." She wrung her hard old
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave her countless things,--clothes and dishes and
      garden seeds tied up in rags, and fruit jars. And although
      she still owned three eighties of land after giving away
      eight other quarter sections to her children, she was glad
      to get the things; said they would help her out through the
      hard winter. Old Christine always thought she was
      poverty-stricken, on the verge of entering the county home.
    </p>
    <p>
      While every one was sorting, warm and hurried, old Oscar
      Lutz came tap-tapping with his cane around to the door. The
      remarks on the side concerning his arrival were more frank
      than polite: "Good-night! . . . old Uncle Oscar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of all days!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He <i>would."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz came tap-tapping smilingly into the
      confusion of the dismantling. He had string beans in an old
      pail with a rope for the handle. He had brought them as a
      gift for any one who wanted them, but no one seemed
      overjoyed at the donation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz was Cedartown's oldest inhabitant. In every
      town and village west of Iowa there is still some old man
      who has seen the beginning and the growth of the community,
      who has watched little saplings grow to ancient trees, and
      the boys of three generations slip into manhood. Even east
      of the Missouri River they are gone. But west of the
      Missouri you will still find them, a few old men who have
      seen everything from the beginning, who once climbed down
      from covered wagons into the waving prairie grass, to turn
      the first furrows in the virgin soil. Some of them are
      still active. Some mill around like restless old buffaloes.
      And some sit on their porches watching the stream of life
      go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are old men of the sea and old men of the
      mountains,--but here in the midwest live the old men of the
      prairie. The old salt tells of the mightiness and
      fascination of the sea, the hillman of the majesty and the
      lure of the mountains, but the old man of the prairie lives
      over his days on the plains. One recalls strong ships
      scuttled on far shores, one the rockribbed fastness of the
      hills, but the other remembers the wave of the grass on the
      prairie. To one there is no memory so lovely as the
      moonlight on the sea, to one the dawn breaking over the
      mountains, but to the old man of the prairie it is the
      sudden hush of the winds at twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz was Cedartown's last old man of the prairie.
      Tall, gaunt, as gnarled as the cottonwoods he had planted,
      he looked akin to the elements with which he had once
      wrestled. Furrows in the virgin soil, and furrows in the
      red-brown face! Eyes the color of the gray-blue ice on
      Stove Creek. Hair and beard like tangled wheat stalks under
      the snow. Hands hard and calloused as old buffalo hide. He
      wore two buttons in the lapel of his shiny old coat,--a
      G.A.R. token, and a little button with the number "68," the
      year he had settled in the state. He was as proud of one as
      the other; a war record on one, and the record of an
      equally harsh war on the other,--the tussle with nature to
      make a home on the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz spent his winters in California, but about
      the time that countless tiny maltese kittens scrambled over
      the branches of the willows down by Stove Creek, old Oscar
      would arrive from the Far West. These were the things in
      Cedartown's calendar of events which proved that spring had
      come: a robin or two suddenly swooping down onto some one's
      leaf-covered lawn, an intermingled odor of bonfires and
      subsoil from over the meadows, pussy-willows at the creek
      bend, and old Oscar Lutz's cane tap-tapping on the
      sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was scarcely any one but old Christine Reinmueller
      left now in the community who had been his friend of the
      early days. But he came back to his old haunts every
      spring, spent a day each with the Mackenzie Deals of Omaha,
      the John Deals of Cedartown, the Bakers of Lincoln, and a
      day with a son or two of some old companion of his
      plainsman's days, regaling them with accounts of their
      ancestors' uprisings and downswings and his own first early
      experiences; tap-tapping through the town with his cane
      ("yes, sir, whittled from a young elm branch down by the
      creek") to his own old closed and musty dwelling. Sturdy as
      an old hickory limb, he would go through the house, open up
      doors and windows, beat some of the ancient rugs and hang
      his dead Marthy's quilts out on the line. There they would
      swing all day in the fresh spring wind and the
      sunshine,--the Rose of Sharon and the Dutch Puzzle, the Log
      Cabin and the Rising Sun. His rather superficial
      house-cleaning done, he was ready for the garden. The
      bursting of the first wild plum blossoms, and the bumbling
      of the first honey-bee always found him in his garden
      behind the fussy old house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those he bored with his constant talk of the
      early days. Because time hung heavily on his hands, his
      greatest delight was to have a listener. The ratio of his
      happiness in declaiming his experiences rose in proportion
      to his audience. One person was a pleasure, two a greater
      satisfaction, three or more standing about listening to his
      tales, taking in attentively all he had to say, lifted him
      to a heaven of rare delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was here to-day, tap-tapping up the cement walk
      to the side door. And the Deals in unison groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," he tapped in smilingly, unaware of his lack
      of welcome, "and so you're getting the old household things
      divided up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Uncle Oscar." He was Mrs. Mackenzie Deal's uncle
      (she had been Henry Lutz's daughter), but he was "Uncle" to
      the others in name only. Emma pushed forward a chair. He
      lowered his gaunt frame into it heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--well--the time goes by and one by one we all pass
      on. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And out," Katherine whispered to Laura. Kathie's recent
      honeymoon had in no way mellowed her flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--well--it seems like only yesterday. I mind as how--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old-Mind-As-How is all wound up ready to go," Katherine
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . we all come across the prairie from
      Plattsmouth,--Marthy and me and the three little tads . . .
      my brother Henry and Sarah, his bride, and Will and Abbie
      Deal, your folks, . . . and you and Gus, Christine. I mind
      as how, Christine, you and Gus had a boat for a wagon-box,
      the stern next to the oxen's hind quarters."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Nein . . .</i> no." Christine spoke up. "De bow . . .
      he vas next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think it was the stern, Christine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine was adamant. <i>"Nein</i> . . . de bow he vas
      next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My money is on Christine," Katherine whispered. "She'll
      never give up. She'll die saying 'De bow he vas next' if
      old Mind-As-How doesn't give in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar went on unperturbed. "We met at the Weeping Water
      and traveled all day against the sun. We could see a faint
      fringe of trees outlinin' the horizon and we knew it was
      Stove Creek. We camped by the creek bed . . . made a
      campfire . . . the stars come out . . . and the Injuns come
      . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one went on about his work. Margaret sorted clothes,
      Grace packed dishes, Isabelle, books. They all went in and
      out unheeding the old man's tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made Laura feel sorry for him. People were always that
      way with old Oscar. Something about the disinterest they
      seemed to show brought out her sympathy. She wondered how
      it would feel to be old and to bore people. Of course, he
      didn't realize he bored them,--that was one good thing.

      "I mind as how when Henry and I first come we got a house
      nigh about where Plattsmouth stands . . ." He was going on
      and on with no one giving him any special heed. "Stayed all
      night with some folks by the name of . . . wait a minute .
      . . name slips . . . tell you in a minute . . . A B C D E F
      G . . . Gunwall . . . always run down the alphabet if you
      can't locate a name . . . works every time . . . stayed
      with a family by the name of . . . what's I say a minute
      ago?" he asked Laura. "Gunwall . . . that's it. Slept on
      the floor, had a latch . . . a wooden latch you run a
      leather thong through to hook the door . . . like this. . .
      ." With his cane and fingers he showed definitely the form
      of the latch. "Toward daylight . . . come clear daylight,
      mebbe, I should say . . . saw the leather thong on the
      latch keep moving . . . somebody workin' away on the latch
      . . . pretty soon the leather pulled outwards, and the door
      opened 'n' in come four o' the biggest Injuns y' ever saw .
      . . feathers 'n' moccasins 'n' tommyhawks 'n' all. For two
      cents I'd crawled out 'n' drowned myself in the Platte.
      Come to think . . . don't know's I could a drowned . . .
      water was lower 'n' git out. This man . . . what'd I say? .
      . . A B C D E F G . . . Gunwall . . . this man Gunwall met
      'em 'n' talked to 'em. They grunted 'n' stepped around over
      the beds on the floor . . . made known they wanted
      something to eat . . . ate a handout . . . laughed a bit.
      You always think of Injuns serious I bet, don't you?
      T'ain't so . . . full of jokes . . . if you don't mind the
      kind they sometimes perpetrated."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and fell into an absent-minded mood as though he
      were actually seeing the scenes of which he talked so
      fluently. The Deals moved all around him, back and forth,
      sorting, packing. Soon he came to the present with "Goin'
      to take a flower down to lay on Gunwall's grave some of
      these days; think I can locate it . . . it'll be som'ers on
      the north side of a bunch of cottonwoods at the old Prairie
      Home cemetery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the kitchen Isabelle Rhodes was saying: "I could
      scream to have to listen to him. He doesn't live in the
      present . . . just inhabits another world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise said stiffly: "He's like house-cleaning and taxes
      and being fooled the first of April,--you just have to have
      them all whether you want to or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he starts visiting me," Katherine, the bride, made her
      definite pronouncement, "I'll simply disappear when he
      arrives. Great-uncle or not, life is too short to be bored
      by the old pest."
    </p>
    <p>
      It made Laura feel sorry for the old man. "I kind of like
      him," she admitted. "He sort of fascinates me, now that
      Grandma's gone. When he's gone, too . . . did you ever stop
      to think, Katherine, that when your old Uncle Oscar Lutz
      and old Christine Reinmueller are gone, there won't be any
      one . . . not a soul left that came here in wagons, and
      started the community. Just think, we'll lose connection
      forever with the pioneer days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can sever the connection any time, Lolly, as far as
      I'm concerned," was Katherine's rejoinder. "Nothing bores
      me to a state of coma quicker than a rehash of this
      native-sons-and-daughters, heroic-lives,
      corn-bread-in-a-sod-house stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting late and the Deal clan stopped work for the
      day. Old Christine took her things and waddled down the
      lane toward home, her blue calico dress switching the tall
      grass at the roadside. When the Deals all left, the old man
      was still mulling over his recollections, and no one had
      taken the string beans.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a half-dozen cars in the lane road. Every one
      offered to take him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "I'll walk. Don't stop walking and you'll
      never get rusty in the joints."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the John Deal car turned out of the lane road, Laura
      looked back. The old man was leaning on his cane and
      looking across the fields and meadows to the sun slipping
      low in the west. A sudden mist came to her eyes. She wished
      the others liked him better. Poor old man. When she got
      home she would write about him:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Poor old man, looking toward the sun,<br>
      What do you remember, now that life's done?
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="c03" id="c03">CHAPTER 3</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Deal clan worked three days before they had finished
      dismantling their mother's home and getting it ready for
      occupancy by Herman Rinemiller's hired man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw so many things in my life," each one insisted.
      "Loads and loads of the accumulations of years. Every
      magazine, every paper, every string and button that ever
      came into that house Mother had hoarded."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the old things, once so precious, each one
      representing sacrifice for the purchase, were scattered to
      the four winds,--to children, grandchildren, neighbors,
      friends, church organizations, Salvation Army, the junk
      pile down by Stove Creek,--like leaves from some sturdy old
      oak blown hither and yon in the dead of the year. Margaret
      took the clock with the little brown church painted on the
      glass, Isabelle the tallow lamp, Mack the thumbed-over
      Shakespeare,--"Mother used to make me read it when I didn't
      know what it was all about," he explained,--and John the
      blue plush album, with Eloise deeply annoyed at his absurd
      choice. Katherine deigned to admit into the lovely new home
      of English architecture, the newest looking of the pieced
      quilts,--of Jacob's Ladder design. Grace, choosing the
      scrapbook, was surprised beyond measure when Laura, usually
      quiet and shy as a little brown quail, pounced upon it with
      an almost tearful ferocity: "Oh, no, Aunt Grace, not the
      scrapbook. It's mine . . . please. Grandma always read them
      all to me . . . she <i>said</i> I could have it. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was upset beyond measure and was ready to insist
      upon Laura's turning it over to her Aunt Grace with
      apologies, but Aunt Margaret intervened, and Laura bore
      home her two possessions in peace,--the little hairy
      calf-skin trunk with the nailhead initials on it, and the
      thick old scrapbook with all the lovely verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise did not understand Laura. Mother and daughter, they
      seemed not even remotely related. Brisk, practical,
      efficient and humorless, Eloise, by some strange joke of
      nature had given birth to a child of emotions, of fancies
      and dreams. And no barnyard hen on the river's brink was
      ever more worried and exasperated over her swimming
      duckling than was Eloise over Laura's disinclination to
      show any characteristics of her own (the Wentworth) side of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the last of that month, when all seemed normal again
      after Grandma's death,--so soon does Life slip back to its
      regular routine--in the privacy of her upstairs blue and
      white room, Laura began writing a long story. It took her
      several days, and Eloise went many times to the stairway
      with: "Laura, whatever are you doing? Do get at some work.
      We all have to work,--people in our circumstances, at
      least. If we were better off maybe you could sit around
      that way, but we might as well face facts that we never
      will be wealthy and able to enjoy life." There are those
      who would have taken exception to Eloise's statement. But
      that was Eloise's philosophy: great wealth brought comfort
      and happiness. And having no great wealth, she resigned
      herself, perforce, to a state of no great comfort and no
      deep happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura would dutifully get up, stir things around a bit in
      her room and then settle down to the absorbing story. It
      was entitled "A Love That Never Came to Pass" or "The
      Professor's Life Tragedy." It involved the unrequited love
      of a college professor for a fellow member of the faculty.
      To be sure, no obstacle seemed to stand in the way of a
      happy culmination of the affair, excepting the advice
      against marriage freely given by a villainous unmarried
      roommate of the wooed-but-not-won lady, the former
      resembling Aunt Grace so thoroughly in Laura's mind that
      she felt a little guilty over the accurate description.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day of the composition period, the embryonic
      author grew so upset over the tragic affair that she cried
      too copiously to see the pages clearly. It was in this
      state that her mother found her. Exasperated mother and
      embarrassed daughter took part in a dialogue which got them
      nowhere; indeed, which only seemed to push them farther
      apart in their understanding of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That child worries me so," Eloise told John that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you suppose anything could be"--Eloise was pale in her
      earnestness--<i>"wrong</i> with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. She's a smart kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where did she get it . . . that foolish emotion? Not
      from <i>my</i> side of the house, that's certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we'll assume responsibility . . . the Deals." John
      grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Wentworths are all so practical. Look at Uncle Harry
      Wentworth--worth a half <i>million,</i> if a dollar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that money originally came from his wife." John
      could not resist. At which Eloise closed her mouth with the
      unspoken eloquence she sometimes assumed, and John went
      silently back to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Laura had carried the sad life story of the professor
      to a close which ended in a grave under a weeping-willow
      tree with the erstwhile juggler of his happiness planting
      bleeding-heart bushes on the grave, she washed the visible
      liquid form of her emotion from her eyes, and went down to
      cousin Katherine's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine's and Jimmie Buchanan's new home was lovely and
      modern and smart, just as Katherine herself was lovely and
      modern and smart. Its lawn was only beginning to emerge,
      pretty and green, from the recent dirt of the excavation.
      But the house itself was a finished affair from the beveled
      glass of the front door to the green and white incinerator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura opened the immaculate white front door and stepped
      into the hall with a little, "Hoo-hoo!" She reveled in the
      sight of the lovely rooms with the gay wedding gifts all
      about, the inner doors with their sparkling glass and filmy
      lace, the mahogany and white stairway winding to the upper
      rooms, the long lovely sitting-room with the one end taken
      up by the fireplace and the open bookcases. No one was in
      sight, but immediately she heard a door open, and
      Katherine's head appeared around the corner of the upstairs
      hall to be followed by the rest of Katherine in an
      orchid-colored underslip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's you, Lolly." That was Katherine's pet name for
      her cousin. Millard, she had long ago dubbed "The
      Tribulation," shortening it later to Trib, a nickname which
      half the town called him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on in and make yourself homely, Lolly," she called
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura giggled appreciatively. Kathie was always so funny.
      She wished Kathie liked her better. No, that was not quite
      the right thing to think. Katherine liked her, but she took
      no pains to conceal the fact that she thought her odd.
      "You're the queerest little duck," she would say whenever
      Laura ventured one of her mature opinions on any subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going out, Lolly." Kathie looked down at her as she
      dropped a lovely orchid afternoon gown over her head.
      "Bridge at Mrs. A. R. Brown's,--that's short for Ashes of
      Rose, I suppose." Laura giggled. "My word, Laura, this
      little burg has as much going on as Omaha,--that is,
      providing you count every church supper and every study
      club and every female tea. Jimmie wants me to toddle to
      everything . . . good business, he says . . . the old
      diplomat in international relations . . . so I run around
      to them all . . . blue blood, red blood, Catholic,
      Protestant, Republican, Democrat, wet, dry, our bank's
      customers, t'other bank's customers. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was downstairs now, lovely and slim and sparkling.
      Laura thought she had never seen any one so gay and pretty.
      And she smelled like the violets at the foot of the old
      trees by the creek bed. She threw her arms around Laura now
      and gave her a swift caress. Laura was surprised and
      embarrassed beyond measure. So seldom did Katherine notice
      her except to tease. "How old are you, Lolly? Twelve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirteen last week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Imagine! Bless your little kid heart. Well, all I can ask
      for you, Laura," she was suddenly sweet and serious, "is
      that seven or eight years from now, you'll be as gloriously
      happy as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean getting married," Laura said, with the crimson
      creeping under the olive of her skin, "I'm never going to.
      I'm going to do something else." She loved watching Jimmie
      and Katherine--they were a handsome couple. She liked the
      thrill it gave her to look at them together, but she could
      not imagine herself under the same circumstances. She
      shrank from the thought of placing herself in the
      picture--wanted only to look at others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine laughed, "You're a queer little duck." She threw
      her arm around Laura again. "Well, I must go, honey. There
      isn't anybody here. My butler, maid and chef have all gone.
      They're all one person, you know,--I call her my 'unholy
      trinity.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you care if I stay and read?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. But . . ." Katherine paused in slipping on
      a white coat. "What makes you read so much, Lolly? Why
      don't you get out and <i>do</i> more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was again,--the thing her mother always said. "Oh,
      I don't know. I guess I like people in books better than
      the ones outside," she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sudden sound of tap-tapping on the cement
      walk running around to the rear of the house, and Katherine
      looked out to say: "Oh, darn! There's old man
      Whiskery-Whee-Come-Wheeze. Stay here, Lolly, and don't
      squeak, or we'll have to march with Sherman to the sea all
      afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine slipped out to the back door, accepted with
      thanks the beets all washed and clean, took them gingerly
      out of the old bucket with a rope for the handle, kept
      surreptitiously closing the door a little more while the
      old man was talking and finally escaped back to Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't Sherman. It was eatables. 'Knew some families
      further out on the prairie had a worse time than us.'"
      Katherine imitated the old man's high husky voice to
      perfection. "'Didn't have nothin' to eat . . . no money . .
      . last resource was to go out on the prairie 'n' gather up
      the bleached bones o' the buffalo, haul 'em to town and get
      a dollar a load. Nature is kind under her harsh exterior. .
      . . Always leaves somethin' around . . . even if only bones
      bleachin' on the prairie.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed. Katherine was so droll. But something hurt
      her, too. It troubled her to think of the old man trying to
      tell that to Kathie in her orchid-colored chiffon dress and
      her lovely white coat. It <i>was</i> true about the buffalo
      bones. Grandma had said so, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Katherine, gay and lovely, left for the bridge party.
      When Laura saw the car go out of the drive, she locked the
      front door and went into the long living-room. But she did
      not read.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tiptoed down the length of the room as though even then
      some one might be listening. In front of the fireplace she
      stopped and looked up at the huge portrait which filled the
      entire space above the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the painting of a lovely lady in velvet draperies,
      her reddish-brown hair curling over her shoulder and a
      string of pearls at her neck. In her slender tapering hand
      she held a hat with a long drooping plume.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no ordinary painting,--but an heirloom that had come
      to Katherine on her wedding day,--the picture of lovely
      Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, Katherine's and Laura's own
      great-great-grandmother. Standing there alone in the silent
      house and looking up at the lovely lady, Laura recalled all
      that her Grandmother had told her about it,--how the lady
      had been an aristocratic Scotch woman; how her only son,
      Basil, riding to the hounds, had met and wooed and won a
      little sixteen-year-old Irish peasant girl on the Scottish
      moors, married her and taken her home to the great estate
      near Aberdeen; how this lady of the picture had tried to
      make a grand dame of the little Maggie O'Conner, but had
      not succeeded, for the little bride would put on her
      peasant dress and shawl and run away over the moors to her
      own folks. Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie died, and the young
      Basil and his Irish wife had seen all the property slip
      away and revert to the crown. They had come to America then
      with their children, and Grandma herself had been born soon
      after they landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only because Grandma had told about hearing of this
      huge painting that used to hang on the landing of the great
      house in Aberdeen that Kathie knew about it. She had teased
      her father to find it. Uncle Mack had set agents to work
      and though it had cost a great deal of money--he never
      would tell how much--they had found the painting and
      shipped it to Katherine. That was just like Kathie. Kathie
      always got everything she wanted. She wondered if Kathie
      cared very much for the painting, now that she had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Laura stood and looked up at the lovely
      lady. The lovely lady looked back at Laura. But Laura was
      the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie," she said aloud, and the sound
      of her voice in the silent lovely room half startled her.
      "I'm an author."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie gazed back from heavy-lidded
      eyes, her cupid's-bow lips smiling mysteriously as though
      she possessed the concentrated wisdom of all the ages. One
      could not conscientiously say that she seemed pleased at
      the news and approving of it, but neither could one justly
      contend that she was annoyed and distressed. She merely
      smiled that puzzling smile as though, sphinx-like, she knew
      the secret of deep mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I live in a little house all by myself," Laura told the
      lady confidentially, "no one can touch me when I am there.
      And no one can come in." She was enjoying herself,
      dramatizing the situation. She could see herself, a member
      of the fifth generation beyond the lady of the portrait,
      standing in front of the ancestor and confiding in her. "I
      hereby take a vow . . ." she went on. All at once it struck
      her that there should be some special emphasis to such a
      serious statement, some rite performed which would verge on
      the sacred. She ought to do it with human blood, but she
      did not quite relish the thought of puncturing her own
      anatomy. She wished she had something that would make a
      good imitation of blood. Perhaps Kathie had beet juice. She
      tiptoed to the icebox. There were potatoes and head
      lettuce, pickles and pie and cold meat, but not a single
      red condiment. In the medicine closet her quest ended. With
      the cork from a bottle of disinfectant she went back to the
      scene of her solemn promise. "This is a symbol," she said,
      touching her forehead with the scarlet-colored drug: "Laura
      Deal . . . I hereby plight my troth to a career. Nothing
      shall keep me from it. If love comes by, I shall spurn it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She liked the sound of that statement so well that she
      repeated: "If love comes by I shall spurn it . . . him . .
      ." Of course, love had to be a <i>him.</i> She fell to
      wondering what he would look like, providing he did come
      by. In fact, it would be rather disappointing if he did not
      come by to be spurned. It made the tears come to her eyes
      to think how terrible he would feel. But she would be
      obdurate. <i>Obdurate.</i>--that was her new word. She
      mustn't forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door bell ringing suddenly and harshly threw the author
      into something of a panic. She hastily drew a handkerchief
      from her blouse pocket and wiped from her forehead all
      pharmaceutical manifestations of the oath of allegiance to
      a career. Her heart thumping rapidly, she tiptoed to the
      door and peeped cautiously out through the lace-covered
      glass. It was no one at all but Allen Rinemiller, dressed
      in brown corduroys and a blue shirt open at the throat.
      Allen had graduated that spring from High School and the
      captaincy of the football team. He was big and blond. There
      were three distinct waves in his close clipped hair; his
      eyes were crinkling and jolly looking and his tanned skin
      was smooth and firm. She opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Allen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Laura. I went to the back door first where all
      decent tramps and peddlers go, but nobody came. You the
      hired girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed. She didn't know Allen Rinemiller so very
      well, but she had watched him lots of times at football
      games and heard the older girls talk about him, and
      sometimes when she had been at Grandma's he had plowed or
      used the disc or picked corn close to Grandma's yard, for
      his father's land joined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin Kathie's gone away," she volunteered. "What did you
      want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> didn't want anything. <i>She's</i> the one that
      wanted it. Wood." And Laura noticed for the first time the
      truck in the driveway. "Dry elm wood for the fireplace. I
      want to know where to put it, but first I want to try a
      chunk in the fireplace if I can, to see if the size is
      right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura told him to come right in and try the chunk and she
      would phone Kathie at Mrs. A. R. Brown's to see where it
      was to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Allen Rinemiller, stepping gingerly over Kathie's
      oriental rugs, brought in a huge chunk, carrying it easily
      on his stalwart shoulder. And when Laura came back with the
      message that the wood was to go in the south end of the
      basement, he had the screen removed and the chunk in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O.K. . . . if this one goes, they all go," he said and
      stood up, looking curiously about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee . . . swell joint." He was evidently appreciating the
      lovely rooms with their soft rugs and draperies, their
      attractive furniture, books and pictures and bowls of
      flowers. "Gosh . . . I'd like a house like this." Without
      apology, he walked back to the hall and looked out to the
      diningroom. There were lavender asters on the dark polished
      table out there and a big bowl of white ones beyond on the
      bench in the green and white breakfast-nook. He could even
      catch a glimpse of the white enamel of the kitchen with its
      dainty green and white curtains over leaded windows.
      "Gosh," he reiterated ". . . just about perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's nice, too. I like to come here." Laura was
      glad Allen Rinemiller liked it so well. She had been in his
      house with her grandmother and knew that it was scrubbed to
      a shining neatness but terribly plain, straight wooden
      chairs, shining oak table and sideboard, coarse lace
      curtains ruffled and starched.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was going back to the fireplace for the chunk, he
      stopped short. "Who's the dame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura almost blushed in her fear that the lovely lady in
      the picture might suddenly open her cupid's-bow mouth and
      start to tell all she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Kathie's and my great-great-grandmother," she told
      him. And for the first time she sensed a rather snobbish
      pride in the aristocratic ancestor. No one could say
      Allen's ancestors, on his father's side at least, were
      aristocratic. Old Christine Reinmueller, his grandmother,
      was "Dutchier than sauerkraut" every one admitted. She had
      never even learned to talk all English, but would mix her
      German words atrociously with the American ones. They said
      Gus, his grandfather, who died a few years before, had
      wound rags around his feet for socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her name was Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, and she lived on a
      big estate in Scotland. My Uncle Mack in Omaha had this
      painting sent over from Scotland this summer when Kathie
      was married. And those pearls she has around her neck in
      the picture are the very pearls Grandma Deal gave Kathie
      for a wedding present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you beat it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was painted lots more than a hundred years ago, about a
      hundred and fifty, I guess, and the agent Uncle Mack hired
      had an awful hard time finding it." Laura was surprised at
      her own talkativeness. After all, it wasn't hard to talk to
      any one who was really interested in the same thing you
      were. And Allen Rinemiller acted interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her another question or two, said "My gosh," and
      "Can you beat it?" and suddenly came to the present with a
      cheerful: "Well, this'll never buy the baby a shirt,"
      shouldered his log lightly and started away. At the door he
      paused. "Did you know I'm going up to the University to
      school?" It was the pride of the male of the species
      strutting a little before the other sex, even though the
      female was a plain brown wren of a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Allen, I'm glad. Isn't that nice?" Laura was
      genuinely surprised. Not many of the Reinmuellers had gone
      away to school. But Laura was forgetting something. Laura
      was forgetting that it was the Reinmuellers who seldom went
      away to school. And Allen, of the third generation, was a
      <i>Rinemiller.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Verna Conden going too?" She asked the question
      teasingly. It still seemed slightly audacious for her to be
      talking to the big High School football captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen grinned. "No, she's looking for a job . . . clerking
      or something. Say, Laura, I'll appoint you a committee of
      one to keep an eye on my girl when I'm gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed at the frank retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked a few moments more about the University, and
      then Allen went singing to the truck and the piling of the
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time she could hear the chunks whacking against
      the cement and a gay unmusical voice singing of a lady in a
      balcony in a little Spanish town.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      <a name="c04" id="c04">CHAPTER 4</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Allen Rinemiller left Katherine Buchanan's home, he
      drove around by the Conden cottage and dated Verna to go
      down to Weeping Water to a show in the evening. Verna was
      pretty in a wind-blown fashion, with fly-away hair upon
      which a beret was usually perilously perched. She was gay
      and noisy, conscious always of her own vivacity. Her eyes
      were hard and bright, her generous mouth too scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Landed a job yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Verna had not landed a job. She guessed she'd just have
      to go in some one's kitchen. Maybe it ought to be her own
      kitchen. She believed maybe she'd advertise for a man. Her
      hard bright eyes laughed at Allen. Allen liked her--he
      liked her a lot--but whenever she talked that provocative
      way it made him uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left her and started home, driving the little truck
      fast over the graveled roads, he gave her no more thought.
      In fact he was thinking of the home in which he had just
      been. He wished their own house looked like the Buchanans'.
      There was something about it that you just absorbed into
      your system,--it was so satisfying. Several of the members
      of his old High School class had some homes similar,--all
      low-shaded lights and cushions and book-ends and rugs that
      were soft as Turkish towels. He believed he'd talk to his
      mother about getting some new things.
    </p>
    <p>
      His drive on the highway was very short, only a half mile
      beyond the town limits. But there was another quarter of
      mile drive on their own land, for the Rinemiller house sat
      back so far that one approached it down a long private lane
      bordered by walnut trees. The house itself was plain, a
      white box so symmetrical that, save for the narrow porch
      across the front, it looked like a child's huge
      cubic-shaped block set down in the exact center of the
      Rinemillers' holdings. Old Gus Reinmueller, dead these many
      years, had come over sixty years before into the young
      state with Christine, "his woman," driving oxen hitched to
      a rowboat on wheels with a dingy cover over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been part of that great general movement in
      settling Nebraska. Bison herds, bands of Indians and wild
      fowl had held complete possession of the land until the
      first isolated settlements, clinging to the banks of the
      sluggish Missouri, made their advent. Indian trails then
      became trails for adventurers, Mormons, gold hunters,
      freighters. These were followed by the settlers with the
      homing instinct of so many birds of passage. Covered wagons
      jolted over the old trails and made new ones through the
      prairie grass. Many of these homesteaders were of the old
      stock of corn farmers from Illinois, Iowa, Indiana,
      Wisconsin. Many more were of foreign blood. These latter,
      because of their common language and background, tended to
      group themselves in the same regions. Thus, Kearney County
      became predominately Danish; Phelps County, Swedish. The
      Mennonites grouped in Fairbury, the Bohemians in Saline and
      Butler Counties, the Hollanders in southern Lancaster. All
      were highly efficient farming people. But everywhere came
      the Germans, equally efficient and thrifty. Of these were
      Gus and Christine Reinmueller, Allen's grandparents. And a
      far cry it now seemed from old Gus and Christine to young
      Allen with his finer sensitiveness, his clear-eyed modern
      viewpoint, his flexibility toward all the modes of the
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those old days Gus and Christine had built a dugout at
      the end of a ravine by digging into the low hillside,
      setting sturdy tree trunks a short way from the opening and
      covering the top with poles cut from the branches of the
      few trees growing along the creek bed, across which they
      packed a solid roofing of sod. Into this, with only the
      hard dirt floor and the one opening, they had moved from
      their wagon. For several years they lived there with their
      babies, like so many rabbits in a hutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gus and Christine worked early and late; Christine in the
      field by the side of Gus, staying away from her man's work
      only when her babies were born, proud of the small number
      of days she took off for those events. They bought almost
      nothing. Clothes were handed down from child to child. They
      ate what they raised. They suffered with the rest of the
      pioneers through all the long hardships of drouth,
      grasshoppers, blizzards, crop failures. They suffered with
      the other early settlers, it is true, but with one
      difference,--their hardships were all physical. There was
      no suffering of the spirit, like that which came to the
      Lutzes and the Deals. They were stolid, inured to poverty,
      cared nothing that they were deprived of food for the mind,
      thought being able to write one's name on a receipt the
      only necessity for schooling. When money came in they
      hoarded it. They thought only of one thing. Land. Before
      Gus had quite finished paying for the first eighty acres of
      land he was contracting to go in debt for another. To
      enlarge their holdings became a fetish with them. Two
      eighties now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's like paying for a dead horse," Will Deal, his
      neighbor, had once told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ya--dead horse." Gus had shrugged his shoulders. "But
      purty soon already . . . that dead mare she come to life.
      Ya?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The dugout gave place in time to a small cheap two-roomed
      frame house in which they all huddled. They were up at four
      o'clock in the morning, routing out the children, too. The
      little boys husked corn with half frozen hands. Three
      eighties. Four eighties. Later they added two more rooms.
      The girls could husk now. Five eighties--six eighties.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bought Abbie Deal's land. Seven eighties. It was
      across the road on this eighty that they built the white
      house as it now stood, large, cubic-shaped, as long as wide
      and as high as long, a cheap narrow porch across the front,
      four square rooms downstairs and four square rooms up. They
      bought more land of Oscar Lutz. Oscar was living in town
      now, merely holding his land for investment. Eight
      eighties. Some of the boys could work away now, the girls
      take places in town, and all bring home their wages. Nine
      eighties. There were no conveniences in the house; water
      was carried from the well in buckets. Small kerosene lamps
      made glow-worm lighting in the rooms when, indeed, lighting
      became necessary. It was extravagant to sit up and use
      kerosene. "Get to bed, all of you. To-morrow yet the
      husking begins."
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept the two front rooms closed. Too much fuel to have
      them open. "Keep hustling . . . all of you. If you're cold
      already yet . . . work faster some more. Get out at that
      milking." Oscar Lutz still owned two eighties. Gus and
      Christine could not stand it to see the black loam across
      their barbed-wire fence; could not bear to see Oscar Lutz's
      tenant plowing up close to their own holdings. They made
      Oscar an offer. "Too much he wants. For himself he say he
      keep two eighties. To come back from California summers and
      see some of his own land yet he wants. I no more ask him,"
      Gus had said. But Christine's mind had harried her with
      land gluttony; her little eyes glinted with the thought of
      the ownership of the mellow soil. <i>"Du narr</i> . . .
      Some more you ask." She had urged Gus. "A little more you
      offer. Go on . . . qvick."
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally Oscar Lutz had sold. Ten eighties. Eleven
      eighties. No one in this end of the county owned so much.
      Only one boy was left at home at that time,--the youngest,
      Herman. For some unknown reason, Gus and Christine had been
      a little more lenient with Herman. There had been a bit
      more leisure for Herman, not quite so much "Get to work . .
      . you" for the youngest. Herman had gone into town almost
      every day to school, riding his pony and carrying rye bread
      and sausage in a tin pail. They had only required him to
      stay out at husking time and for plowing. Herman had gone
      clear through the eighth grade, had even gone on into High
      School for one year, but Gus and Christine had put an end
      to that foolishness. "For what good you think them Latins
      is?" Christine wanted to know. And Gus had laughed, "Ya,
      Herman . . . that Latin make you pick more corn faster and
      bring you in more pigs . . . huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Herman had dropped the subject of going on through High
      School and had cut alfalfa all that first day when his
      class entered as sophomores. But as time went on, there had
      been something in Herman that would not prostrate itself so
      thoroughly before the god of Work. He had labored hard
      enough, when he was at it. But he had done other things
      too. He had taken farm papers. He had put a tin bathtub in
      one of the empty upstairs rooms, fixed it with a plug to
      let the water run out even though he had to carry the water
      up to it, had "slicked up" and gone to all the town doings,
      left the church of his fathers for an English-speaking one,
      had begun going with gentle Lucy Steele without a drop of
      German blood in her veins. About this last procedure, Gus
      and Christine had made a great many caustic comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you get yourself a German girl?" Gus had wanted
      to know. And "Ya!" Christine had snorted. "A <i>stark</i> .
      . . strong one mit some <i>harte muskeln</i>--muscles."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, while Herman was still going steadily with the
      pretty and refined Lucy Steele, old Gus had suddenly died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death played old Gus a mean trick by slipping up on him
      unawares, with no more advance notice than the scratch of a
      shingle nail. Herman, looking at the red wound, had wanted
      his father to go right over to town to the doctor. But Gus
      and Christine had said no, the doctors just took your money
      whether you needed any treatment or not and they would put
      plenty of fat pork on it to draw out the poison. But the
      drawing qualities of the butchered hog had failed to
      materialize, and quite suddenly old Gus was dead. "At the
      seedin' time, too," Christine had wailed. "Mit the calves
      comin' in . . . and all. How ve get along already? Mein
      Gott!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, old Gus had made a will. John Deal had drawn
      it up. It had been signed by Gus and duly
      witnessed,--signed with a cross and a notary public's
      affidavit that the cross was the signature of one Gus
      Reinmueller. The land was left to Christine to do with as
      she wished. Gus had realized that Christine was the more
      crafty of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      And old Christine had land then. Old Christine had her
      life's desire. Lots of land. The boys were all on the
      various eighties. Heinie here, Fritz there, Ed on another,
      Emil farming two quarters, the girls' husbands on others.
      All had bought more land of their own. All but Herman were
      getting toward middle age. They were hard working,
      well-to-do. Their homes were beginning to have
      conveniences, and they were sending their children on
      through High School. Christine deeded over an eighty to
      each of six, but gave two, including the home eighty, to
      Herman. Three adjoining ones she kept for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Herman married the soft-voiced Lucy who had gone
      through High School and taught a year, and brought her home
      to the cubic-block of a house, up the long road by the
      walnut trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Christine had said a great many things about it. She
      had gone over to her neighbor, Abbie Deal, many times in
      her grief and distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach . . . Gott!" She had wrung her hard hands in distress.
      "Sale carpets on de two front rooms . . . mit green roses
      every t'ree or four feet already. Curtains by de vindows .
      . . mit ribbons tied back. <i>Nrrish</i> . . . voolish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Christine, that's nice." Abbie Deal had comforted
      her. "You ought to be glad. You ought to be happy because
      Herman is happy with such a nice wife and that she is
      fixing it up so comfortably."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christine could not be comforted. She had waddled in
      disgust back down the lane road at the Deals', her blue
      calico dress gathered at the waistline, angrily switching
      the dusty jimson weeds. Each time she had gone over to the
      Deals' there was more distressing news to convey,--the
      advent of a piano and a piece of furniture in the dining
      room she thought they called a "boardside." But of them
      all, nothing seemed to irritate her so thoroughly as the
      carpet "mit de green roses every t'ree or four feet," as
      though the multiplicity of flowers added insult to the
      general prodigal expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Christine had lived with Herman and Lucy the greater
      part of a year. And then Herman, seeing that his beloved
      Lucy was ill and nervous, and that Christine was making her
      more so, quite firmly had moved his mother to a small
      tenant cottage across the road, and had seen her
      comfortably settled there in the little house where the
      wastefulness of fuel and the lavish squandering of money
      for kerosene need not distress her. That was the
      year--eighteen years before--that Herman and Lucy's only
      child had been born,--Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was also the year that Emil and Fritz and Ed and
      Herman and all the rest of the Reinmuellers met together
      and decided to drop the superfluous letters from their
      name. Their young folks were marrying here and there, some
      were changing their memberships to English churches,
      several going away to school. The young folks preferred the
      English spelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reinmuellers had become Rinemillers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home now, Allen put the truck under the shed and went
      into the house, looking about him with the eye of a critic.
      He saw the shining oak chairs and sideboard, the scrubbed
      oilcloth, the rope portieres hanging between the rooms, the
      axminster rugs which had long since replaced the carpet
      that had so distressed his grandmother. He knew nothing was
      right. You couldn't just get something new and put in as he
      had planned on the way home. It wouldn't improve things a
      rat-i-tat--that was a cinch, he said to himself. The only
      way to go about it was to ditch everything out and start
      new. Even then,--and he made himself imagine the square
      rooms divested of furnishings,--even then nothing was
      right; the shape of the rooms, the windows, the floors, the
      ceiling. Oh well,--this was kind of a silly thought, but if
      he ever had a home of his own,--it was going to be just
      right, like the Buchanans'.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother came in with her egg-basket: "You back, Allen?"
      She was sweet faced and pleasant looking--a plump little
      lady with neat light brown hair and wide humorous blue
      eyes. Allen resembled her but he had his father's physique.
      "Eighty-six. I think the White Wyandottes are the best
      breed I've ever had. Was the wood all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep--and gee, Mother, you ought to see the bride's house.
      Looks like the pictures in your women's magazines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I can just imagine it. I hope the Woman's Club will
      meet there so I--oh, Allen," she broke off with a girlish
      squeal of excitement. "How could I forget? Your letters!
      Papa brought in the mail when you were gone." She picked
      them up from the oak sideboard and held them out,--two
      square white envelopes, almost similar in size and texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen tore into one. "A University fraternity party card,"
      he said in an awe-struck voice, "--the Xi Kappas."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore open the other. "Another one," his voice shook a
      little, "--the Pi Taus. The <i>Pi Taus."</i> He repeated it
      with reverential disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, with eyes glued to the white card, he had a
      fleeting vision of driving past an aristocratic looking
      building up at Lincoln the night after a basket-ball game
      at the University Coliseum. It had great cathedral-like
      pillars in front, and was brightly lighted on three floors.
      Cars were drawn up at the curb and fellows in dress suits
      were getting in and out of them. There were girls in velvet
      evening wraps--.

      He raised his head and spoke eloquently: "Oh, my <i>good
      gosh!"</i>

    <p>
      Miraculously, to Allen's way of thinking, he was pledged Pi
      Tau and the aristocratic house with the cathedral-like
      pillars became his home. But Fate, that old woman of the
      loom, snapped the bright colored thread of her weaving in
      the spring after his initiation. For Allen's father died
      suddenly, and Allen went back to the square white house at
      the end of the lane of walnut trees to take complete charge
      of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something had happened to Allen. He was not
      satisfied,--not with himself, not with the old-fashioned
      methods of his father, with the machinery on the farm, nor
      with his limited knowledge of the management of the
      business side of it. To his surprise and deep mystification
      he was not even satisfied with Verna Conden. He lived only
      for the day when he could go back to school,--could tie
      together the broken strands of the weaving and see the
      whole of the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman Rinemiller's death had done something to Old
      Christine, too. She spent most of her time over at the
      square white house talking of Herman, handling things that
      had been Herman's, recalling childish anecdotes about him.
      "A calf . . . he vas sick once . . . my leetle Herman
      t'ought he vas <i>todt</i> . . . dead. Und he took off his
      coat and put it over him . . . and ven ve looked out,
      leetle Herman's coat vas all around de yard runnin'." She
      told it gently in pride and sorrow. It had come to her out
      of a harsh past, from the life of her little son whose
      boyish playtime had been given to work,--a sacrifice on the
      altar of greed. Poor Christine! She had long ago spent the
      days of her young motherhood in the marketplace, and now
      that they were all squandered, she had so few pleasant
      things left to remember. So she crouched low over the dull
      embers of a few half-memories in order to warm her old
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, Allen's mother, was always kind to her old
      mother-in-law, as hard as it was to do anything for her.
      "You can come here and live with Allen and me now, Grandma.
      You know you're as welcome here as though Herman was
      alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Christine's pale blue eyes filled with unaccustomed
      tears. Two or three dropped down on her leathery red-brown
      cheeks with immodest abandon. "A good girl you are," she
      said suddenly, and wiped the miscreant water away with the
      back of a red hand as hard as wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen, always tenderhearted when it came to old people and
      children, seeing her unusual distress, added his own brisk:
      "Sure, Grandma, I'll set you up a little stove in the east
      room and make you a wood-box so you can have your own heat
      and not depend on ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      After which, old Christine tied a veil over her head, took
      her basket of eggs, and in her blue calico dress trudged
      over to town, went into John Deal's office and gave Allen
      two eighties of land via a will to which so many codicils
      had been added that, with more amendments than body, it
      looked much like the Constitution of the United States. She
      signed her name with a cross, saw it witnessed, and trudged
      stolidly back to the farm in her blue calico dress gathered
      full at the waistline.
    </p>
    <p>
      High School to Laura Deal proved to be what High School is
      to any young person in the Cedartowns of the country,--a
      period of youthful ups and downs, illusions and
      disillusions, of long-lived friendships and short-lived
      enmities, of study so interspersed with play that youth
      does not always understand where the one leaves off and the
      other begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura's achievements in those four years were of extremely
      varied results. She was the shining star member of all
      English classes and the dumbest integral portion of all
      mathematical ones. Composition? Although verbally as
      noncommunicative as her father, she wrote reams on any and
      all topics with girlish abandon. Algebra? Eloise, varying
      her home instruction with scolding, sarcasm, and plaintive
      encouragement, managed to assist in pulling her daughter
      through it. American Literature? Laura had read and
      absorbed most of the assignments before they were assigned.
      Physics? Her father, beginning with extreme patience to try
      to augment the teacher's instructions, admitted toward the
      middle of the term an inglorious defeat, and quite frankly
      worked out the rest of the problems for her. Shakespeare?
      She read all the plays demanded in the curriculum, and all
      the others not so nominated in the bond. Plane Geometry?
      John and Eloise together in combined effort, dragged,
      tugged, and pushed their offspring through part of that
      science which treats also of the magnitude of space and its
      relations, to a passing grade. Advanced composition? Laura
      dashed off essays, poems, parodies, stories and
      biographies, both for herself and for such of her girl
      friends as stood in dire need of material assistance. Solid
      Geometry? Instructor and parents, for once in peaceful
      united decision, gave up with calm resignation and allowed
      her to substitute something which, like that portion of her
      mathematical head, was not so solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was prettier now in her Senior year than she had ever
      been. Her clear olive complexion with its warm underlying
      pink, her brown eyes, the softness of her well kept dark
      hair, the suppleness of her body, all helped to make an
      attractive whole. But Laura herself was odd. Every one said
      so. For one thing, in an age when High School dating was
      the most important of the extra curricular events, Laura
      did not enter into the pastime with any degree of pleasure.
      She did not care for boys. Dating, perforce, meant boys.
      And because things that are equal to the same thing are
      equal to each other, it followed that Laura did not care
      for dating. Q.E.D. As skating companions, tennis partners,
      and members at large of any other form of out-door sport,
      she not only tolerated them, she liked them. But when it
      came to rear-seat riding, semi-gloomy-corner sitting, and
      all similar modes of entertainment, Laura was just not
      among those present. More likely, she was curled up in some
      cushioned corner reading or dreaming dreams of her own. She
      was used to hearing people say she was odd. But for the
      most part she did not even care.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Laura gets her nose in a book, she's just dead to the
      world," was Eloise's complaint. "She's not wide awake about
      housework, either. She does her work mechanically as though
      she didn't have the slightest interest in practical things.
      At times I think she's lazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know," John returned, "she's young. She isn't
      lazy about things she likes to do. Maybe we don't
      understand her. Mother always seemed to understand her so
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he saw that he had said the wrong thing.
      Eloise's firm lips gave an example of one of the few
      theorems which had been comprehensible to Laura,--that a
      straight line is the shortest distance between two points.
      "I'm sure, John, that no one can understand a child so well
      as the mother who gave it birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which conclusive biological statement John made no
      reply. He had long ago learned that it was less trying not
      to argue. And for that matter, he did not understand Laura
      himself. He loved her devotedly in his busy way, but he did
      not understand her. But Eloise would not let the subject
      lie. She had to dig it up again and worry it around as a
      dog digs up the bone he has buried and stands barking
      foolishly at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm as fond of books as Laura. She takes that from me as
      much as the Deals. But I don't moon over them. I go in for
      knowledge and data and not the emotion to be obtained from
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise took a keen delight in her club assignments. For
      days before the club meetings, she would work on her paper
      surrounded by an array of text books and encyclopedias. She
      would write and rewrite, hitching a sentence from one text
      book onto a sentence from another in an intricate form of
      rearrangement, and read over the result with deepest pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I go into a subject, I go thoroughly," she would say,
      "I marshal all the facts to be obtained."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Facts--facts . . . what good are just facts?" Laura would
      say to herself, for to her a new phrase of lovely words was
      infinitely more alluring than all the facts of her Mother's
      cherished club work. "Mother never wrote an original thing
      in her life," she would admit to herself. And then in a
      sudden feeling of revulsion at the disloyalty of the
      thought, would throw her arms around Eloise, who stiff as a
      ramrod, would submit to the hasty caress with: "There,
      there, Laura, let mother get at something practical now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's life seemed not rounded out. One may work at
      trivial uninteresting tasks and be neither small nor
      tiresome. But Eloise chose to dwell on the fact that she
      was doomed to a life of trivialities. She gave the
      impression that Providence, through some oversight, had
      neglected to place her in the way of a larger life,
      whatever that was. One inferred that having been formed of
      more artistic, less dusty dust, as it were, than the Deal
      family into which she had married, by some great voluntary
      loss of potential possibilities, she had made herself more
      practical than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dilated long and enviously upon the fact that her Uncle
      Harry and Aunt Carolyn Wentworth had a great deal of money,
      lived in the East, traveled long distances frequently, and
      that by comparison, her own life in Cedartown was a
      constant sacrifice, but cheerfully borne. A card from the
      Wentworths mailed at Havana or Miami or San Diego always
      set her off. "Just think of it, some folks have all the
      luck. At least they have plenty of money which amounts to
      the same thing these days. Where will Uncle Harry and Aunt
      Carolyn go next? They've been everywhere--just everywhere.
      Japan . . . Philippine Islands. Imagine just packing up and
      going places like that. I haven't seen them for years. I do
      wish we could all see them." To be sure, Eloise had other
      uncles and aunts but only these two possessed the golden
      aura so necessary to peace and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the former years she had harbored a secret ambition to
      get her Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn interested in her
      oldest son, Wentworth, inasmuch as he carried the family
      name, but for some reason Uncle Harry never seemed to warm
      to the subject of Wentworth via letter, inquired more often
      about Laura, when he saw fit to write at all. And now that
      Wentworth was in the South these years, married there and
      settled down, Eloise had given up the thought of connecting
      him in any way with the affluent uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, however, she urged to take time and pains to write
      to Uncle Harry. "How can I correspond with some one when I
      don't know what they're like?" Laura would insist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem able to write everything else," Eloise would
      point out. "Why not to as important a man as your Uncle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I have to know the kind of person any one is, and
      then I can be like them. I can feel just like anybody," she
      explained. "I can feel like an old lonely person, or a
      happy young one, or <i>any</i> kind, and then when I get
      into the feeling of it, it is easy to write it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise often grew out of patience with her, and because she
      could not understand her little daughter, there were many
      trying scenes. And because there were many trying scenes,
      Laura retired more constantly into the privacy of her own
      thoughts and dreams. "I like to talk to people that nobody
      understands or likes," she confided to Katherine one day,
      "and make discoveries about them. It interests me just as
      it interests some people to dig for Indian curios along the
      Platte and the Missouri."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the oddest creature, Lolly. Well, what do you find
      when you dig into Old Uncle Lutz,--buffalo bones and chunks
      of sod houses and skeletons of those grasshoppers that 'et
      all the crops in 1874'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed as she always did at Kathie's light and airy
      chatter and her imitation of old Oscar Lutz's high cracked
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was laughing a great deal these days, too, and
      almost entirely at herself. To hear Kathie's comments on
      the subject one would have thought that the process of
      reproduction was the joker in life's deck of cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the tag end of the winter, with almost as much pomp
      and ceremony as royalty demands, Katherine's daughter was
      ushered into the world. She was christened Patricia and
      arrived home from Omaha a month later with the highest
      priced carriage in Nebraska and a nurse whose services, as
      well as those of the smart vehicle, were presented to the
      little Buchanan family by that unfailing source of all
      luxuries,--Mackenzie Deal. Kathie having given life to her
      child, proceeded to call the obligation square and to take
      up her countless social duties exactly where she left off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was spring again, with Laura seventeen now, ready to
      graduate, and old man Lutz home.
    </p>
    <p>
      From March until the last of October the community would
      see him: dreamy old man Lutz sitting on the porch in the
      sunshine watching Cedartown go by, rugged old man Lutz
      walking over the paved streets, his cane thump-thumping on
      the walks that lay over the prairie where the oxen had
      traveled, grizzled old man Lutz laboriously climbing
      Cottonwood Hill to stand with his hand on the gnarled old
      trunk of the cotton-wood tree he had planted over a half
      century before, wistful old man Lutz thump-thumping along
      the graveled walks of the cemetery where all the old
      friends lived in their little narrow houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived next door to the John Deal family so that Laura
      saw him often.
    </p>
    <p>
      His house was as old-fashioned as he himself. Many years
      before, the Cedartown newspaper had carried the item that
      "Our distinguished citizen, Henry Lutz, is moving into the
      beautiful mansion which he has just completed. This is now
      the finest house in Cedartown," and other descriptive
      matter in small town hyperbole.
    </p>
    <p>
      One year later, the same paper carried an item so similar
      that it might have been the identical one with the name
      changed,--"Our distinguished citizen, <i>Oscar</i> Lutz, is
      moving into the beautiful mansion which he has just
      completed. This is now the finest house in Cedartown." If
      any sinister motive of brotherly competition lay under
      these items, no one of Cedartown's citizens was bold enough
      to mention the possibility, for Oscar and Henry Lutz had
      been unusually close companions. If, perchance, there
      flowed any competitive corpuscles of blood through the
      veins of Martha and Sarah Lutz, the brothers' wives, no one
      felt equal to the task of mentioning that, either. And, in
      any event, Oscar and his Martha held the advantage over
      Henry and Sarah, for they waited until the latter had
      expressed themselves in a cupola and fancy cornices and
      gingerbread rosettes, and then put on two cupolas, made the
      cornices more fantastic, and spiced up the gingerbread with
      what was supposed to be an Egyptian lotus effect, but which
      proved, when Asy Drumm, the local architect-and-carpenter,
      had finished the job, to look more like the heads of wild
      cows which needed dehorning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura in her pretty white sport dress was sitting on one of
      these gingerbread railings of the old man's porch now. He
      was in his element to have an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Marthy and me moved to Nebraska, we built a little
      pine and cottonwood house over there on the hill north of
      what's the cemetery now. Nothin' to be seen but the prairie
      grass a wavin' and a scraggly fringe o' trees along Stove
      Creek. Henry and me built together,--that is, we all lived
      in our wagons while we was gettin' his house ready; as soon
      as his was done we all moved in it and worked on one for
      Marthy and me. Hauled the lumber from Weeping Water by
      oxen,--it was only ten miles but it took all day to get
      down and another day to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura let the old man ramble on with no comment from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots of wind those years. Just had a little thin layer of
      ship-lap between us and the wind. Nebraska and wind used to
      mean the same thing. Died down now all these last decades.
      No more wind here than anywhere else. That's what trees
      does for you. You can thank J. Sterling Morton and a whole
      lot of others of us for that,--your grandfather Deal and
      Henry and me set out hundreds through this part of the
      county and got a lot more to take time to set 'em out. But
      in them days the wind just blew across the country most of
      the time with the tumble-weeds comin' along for company.
      Marthy's and my home was pretty thin, I'm tellin' you. Used
      to lay and listen to the wind. Told Marthy once, it seemed
      like we was in a great holler drum with the Lord a tappin'
      and rappin' on the drum."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, listening, said, "Why, that's quite a clever
      thought, Uncle Oscar." And immediately she was thinking out
      a poem:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The little house was like a drum . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the way Grandmother Deal used to be,--sort of
      poetical. She wondered,--did living close to the prairie
      soil the way they had done, give them some inner
      consciousness of the beautiful?
    </p>
    <p>
      She liked to remember how she and Grandma Deal held the
      same liking for lovely things in literature. It was queer
      that an old woman like Grandma with very little education
      would like the things she did. There had never been any one
      since who could fill her place,--to whom she could talk so
      readily. But she could not have held converse with Grandma
      Deal ten minutes without deep interest. They would have
      touched upon some topic attractive to both, laughed at some
      anecdote toward which they displayed the same sense of
      humor, winked back a tear over some happening about which
      they felt the same sympathy. Yes, there had been some deep
      and definite understanding of life in Grandmother Deal to
      which she herself held the key. She did not know what it
      was, could not define it, found it impossible to put into
      words. She only knew that in this kinship, mortal or
      spiritual, there had been a unity of thought and
      expression, a oneness of dreams and desires. And because
      she could not describe the unusual relationship between
      them, which had seemed so much more important than the mere
      relationship of blood, she made no attempt to tell any one
      about it. And because, even to herself, she could not put
      into the limitation of exacting words the vague yearning
      for something beautiful which life was to give to her, she
      thought of it always as a white bird flying. It seemed in
      some indefinable way to connect itself with the dreams and
      desires of her Grandmother. It was like a legacy from her,
      a benediction. She would say to herself:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Pain has been and grief enough and bitterness and
      crying,<br>
      Sharp ways and stony ways I think it was she trod,<br>
      But all there is to see now is a white bird flying,--<br>
      Whose blood-stained wings go circling high,--circling up to
      God."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that in some vague, undetermined way she was
      always to follow with wistful eyes this far-off sheen of
      silver wings, that by some unexplainable magic she was
      always to see from the window of her heart, a white bird
      flying.

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And then, one day in the summer after Laura's graduation,
      with no previous announcement of their coming, and as
      nonchalantly as though they were arriving at a large hotel
      to which they had wired for accommodation, Uncle Harry
      Wentworth and Aunt Carolyn, a chauffeur and a maid, came
      into the driveway. Cedartown is used to good-looking cars
      slipping unconcernedly along the graveled highways which
      cut through the town. Indeed, Cedartown's residents,
      themselves, and the owners of the surrounding farm land
      close their garage doors on as many fine cars as do their
      city neighbors. But the Wentworths' car, an audaciously
      long affair that sported more de luxe equipment and
      trimming per square foot than the most pretentious one in
      the community, made all the children stop their play to
      stare, and the old men on the post-office corner
      temporarily cease whittling out the affairs of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that Eloise was upset when Uncle Harry Wentworth and
      Aunt Carolyn arrived is merely to make a trite statement
      such as "dogs bark" or "the world is round." And to look
      out and witness the descent of Uncle Harry Wentworth from
      that leviathan of a car, was as devastating to Eloise's
      poise as to have been an eye witness through the centuries
      to the entire descent of man. But not for long was Eloise's
      mind a mental gyroscope. She took hold of the situation
      with heroic efficacy. By eleven o'clock, Aunt Carolyn was
      on the davenport with pillows under her shoulders and a cup
      of hot tea in her plump hand. Uncle Harry was in an
      overstuffed chair with a foot-stool under his immaculate
      spats and a glass of iced lemonade in his slim hand.
      Watson, the chauffeur, was in the garage rubbing down the
      car as though it were a thoroughbred horse. Annette, the
      maid, was unpacking. Lunch was well under way and John was
      being summoned home from the office. Laura was assigned the
      task of visiting with the heretofore unknown relatives
      (although she had begged to fix the salad instead) and
      Trib, was turning the ice-cream freezer under the grape
      arbor. Whatever faults may have been Eloise's, she was not
      inefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn, having come from Denver, were
      now about to go up into the woods of northern Minnesota.
      And so it came about after lunch that Uncle Harry, in as
      matter-of-fact manner as though he were offering to take
      them around the block, suddenly decided that Eloise and
      Laura and Trib were going, too, as their guests. "We'll
      take them, won't we, Carolyn?" All at once he seemed
      remembering to ask his wife's opinion, although Laura had a
      swift intuition that Aunt Carolyn assented to everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Harry was slim, debonair, pink-cheeked, his
      snow-white hair and snapping brown eyes forming a striking
      contrast. His hands were long and slim, the nails as pink
      as his cheeks. He was nervous, unsettled, never still a
      moment when talking. He rocked up and down on his heels and
      toes when standing, fidgeted about when sitting. He darted
      his bright brown eyes here and there as though looking for
      something he never saw. His mind, too, seemed darting about
      in the same agile way, seeking something it never found.
      Aunt Carolyn was a complete antithesis. Physically fat,
      shapeless, and two-chinned, her mind also seemed fat,
      shapeless and two-chinned. She answered questions slowly if
      at all. Much of the time she merely smiled in answer to
      Uncle Harry's rather exaggerated statements. Having been
      left behind on most of her husband's mental flights,
      apparently she had now given up the breathless pursuit and
      settled back in obese complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was delighted with the invitation but unable to see
      how it could be done. Uncle Harry assumed all details of
      the plan. The front seat was wide,--he and Watson and
      Annette could all three sit there very comfortably, Aunt
      Carolyn and Eloise in the back seat, Trib and Laura on the
      adjustable ones. They would start early the next morning,
      get to Okoboji for lunch, Minneapolis by night, and the
      second day easily reach the north woods hotel to which they
      were bound. Eloise argued that the two should make their
      stay longer in Cedartown, but apparently Uncle Harry,
      having thought of the new scheme, wanted to carry it out
      immediately. He see-sawed up and down on his slim
      immaculate shoes, waved his hands in illustrative
      gesticulation, winked a roguish eye at Laura, chucked her
      under the chin, sat down and tapped the chair arms, stood
      up and rubbed his hands together in nervous glee. Aunt
      Carolyn lay shapelessly among the pillows of the davenport
      and smiled steadily without effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Uncle Harry's sudden inspiration that John go up on the
      train and meet them, Laura's father only shook his head and
      named two or three important reasons for not doing so,--the
      Blackman estate, a guardianship case, preparation for the
      schoolboard suit. Uncle Harry looked at John Deal with
      something akin to curiosity. Here was a man who seemed
      irrevocably tied by a hundred chains to a desk. For a brief
      moment he might have been wondering how it would seem not
      to be able to go where he wished, whenever he wished. Then
      his restless mind was off again on another tangent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was decided that they were really to go, Eloise
      rose to the management of the preparations like a bass to
      the lure. Her efficient brain pigeon-holed every activity
      of the household. Trib was to ride on his bicycle and give
      certain instructions to the woman who did cleaning for her.
      Laura was to look over her own clothes and her mother's for
      any missing buttons or stitch. Eloise, herself, turned off
      a dozen necessary tasks. Uncle Harry walked nervously about
      the house. Annette fanned Aunt Carolyn who lay supinely
      among the pillows, the bustling activity going on around
      her like so much wind around a granite monument. Watson
      groomed the flawless car.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of preparations old Oscar Lutz tap-tapped
      around to the back door, a mess of spinach in the gray pail
      with a rope for the handle. Eloise was provoked. "That old
      codger--whatever is the matter with him?
      <i>Spinach</i>--the night before we're going away. He
      <i>knew</i> we were going. Dad told him. I heard him out by
      the morning-glories. Now he'll have to meet Uncle Harry.
      And how well they two will mix."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura took the spinach. She understood old Oscar Lutz
      better than her mother. He wanted to do something for them,
      so he was saying it with spinach. She introduced old Oscar
      to Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn. Uncle Oscar was pleased to
      meet them, both verbally and whole-heartedly. Here was a
      fresh new audience,--one to whom no anecdote of his was old
      material. He had a full life time of experiences upon which
      to draw, not one of which these people had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand, as hard and calloused as untanned buffalo hide,
      shook Uncle Harry's slim bony one and Aunt Carolyn's
      cushion-like soft one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not five minutes later until Eloise and Laura, going
      on with their preparations for the journey, could hear his
      high cackling laugh and his enthusiastic "I mind as how--"
      It seemed to be something about traveling in the early
      days, the subject introduced no doubt by the present
      anticipated trip. "I mind as how I started out doin' all my
      travelin' on 'Shanks mares' over the hills, wadin' in mud
      or deep snow." They could hear snatches of the one-sided
      conversation. "Well, well, travelin' wa'n't what you'd call
      ideal in them days, but we had lots o' fun . . . more 'n'
      they have now, seems like. I mind as how I made a cutter
      out o' good stout lumber, lined the inside with buffalo
      so's to be warm and comfortable for Marthy. Had a soapstone
      we'd take along and two or three bricks--heat 'em all in
      the fire, wrap 'em up good, tuck Marthy in with her feet on
      the soapstone and put mebbe two buffalo robes all around us
      and away we'd go, bells ringin', and happy as larks."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more monologue on the subject and by the time
      Eloise had returned to the living room, she found Uncle
      Oscar going strong on the Easter blizzard of '73, Uncle
      Harry moving about with the peevish headshakes of an
      irritated animal, and Aunt Carolyn frankly asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that evening Laura was thrilled with the thought of the
      unexpected trip. Just one thing was lacking--her father.
      She felt a deep disappointment that he could not go--a
      sympathetic understanding of the cares that harassed him.
      He was like the old man of the sea,--the burdens of the
      community the bundle on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gay lark to glide along the country in Uncle Harry
      Wentworth's great car. Uncle Harry sat with Annette and the
      chauffeur, a young married couple. He had his arm on the
      back of the seat and sometimes he would touch the back of
      Annette's white neck with his nervous slim fingers. Once
      Aunt Carolyn said, "Annette, if you're crowded, you can
      come back here." Much of the time he was turned around
      talking excitedly to Laura and Trib who sat on the smaller
      extra seats. Aunt Carolyn did not talk a great deal. She
      sat quietly with the little fixed smile on her fat face.
      Laura stole surreptitious glances at her sometimes and
      wondered just what she was thinking. Did she enjoy her
      husband's nervous chatter? Did she approve of his
      extravagant statements? Did the little fixed smile mean she
      was happy? Or was it a mask? Sometimes she went to sleep
      for a few moments, her head against the gay cushions, and
      the smile vanished, so that her plump face looked flabby
      and sad. Laura, stealing a covert glance at her then, tried
      to picture her in another environment, and invariably she
      saw her in a washable house dress and big white apron, her
      plump hands, white with flour, making cookies for hungry
      little grandchildren. It was a foolish notion, Laura told
      herself, but it seemed the setting in which she really
      belonged, rather than the present one of traveling about
      the country in the palatial car with her silver-mounted
      luggage and her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made Laura think how different many people would look in
      other environments. It was queer what clothes and setting
      did to one. She pictured Katherine Buchanan in sleazy cheap
      clothes, and her own father as a section boss in overalls,
      thought of Allen Rinemiller in his collegiate-looking suits
      and hats since he had been to the University.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group of travelers stopped for a little time by the
      shores of Storm Lake and again at Okojobi and Spirit Lakes.
      Laura and Trib were charmed beyond words. Children of
      eastern Nebraska, they had known intimately only the
      Missouri and the Platte and a small lake or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a night in Minneapolis at a big hotel, with Uncle
      Harry in his breezy way creating a stir and commotion in
      getting settled when there was no need of either, and then
      the long trip to the north lakes. At the first odor of
      pines and the first sight of white birches bending above
      blue waters, Laura felt that old emotional uplift she
      always experienced when drinking in a new atmosphere.
      Immediately she was reveling in the "feel" of the setting:
      picturing sleek-haired Indian maidens and their
      light-footed lovers meeting here on the sloping shores. Her
      palm itched for the touch of a pencil and, because she had
      no means of putting down her emotional disturbances just
      then, she sat for a long time saying nothing, but mentally
      composing snatches of description and bits of verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two weeks spent there at the rustic hotel were by way
      of being a bit of heaven both to seventeen-year-old Laura
      and thirteen-year-old Trib. The white birches drinking
      forever from glass-clear waters, the tall pines massed
      against sapphire skies, the clear spongy carpet of
      sweet-smelling needles, all filled Laura with the poetry of
      living that she always experienced when everything was
      "just right." Trib's sensations were not of a poetical
      type. The motorboat at the dock, the box of lures, the rods
      and reels for which Uncle Harry arranged, constituted a
      large part of his own particular joy of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mornings were spent in fishing, up the long lake in the
      motorboats, casting for the sporty bass or trolling for the
      common pike, with the hope always present of getting a wily
      muscallonge. At eleven there was bathing, and again at
      four, when the water was full of young people and old with
      water-wings and joy balls. After dinner, cards for the
      older people, dancing for the young, inside the hotel or on
      the screened-in porches into which the mosquitoes could
      only gaze hungrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Carolyn and Eloise settled themselves each night for
      bridge. But Uncle Harry danced, always with the prettiest
      and youngest girls. Sometimes Aunt Carolyn, calm and
      placid, watching the dancers, would send for him. She
      wanted a silk shawl or would he please go and see whether
      Watson had looked over the car in preparation for the trip
      tomorrow. It seemed queer to Laura. She could not quite
      sense what was wrong. Aunt Carolyn was pleasant. Uncle
      Harry punctilious in attendance. But something was not just
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Aunt Carolyn lots older than Uncle Harry?" she asked
      her mother once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness, no" . . . Eloise laughed, "he's anyway two years
      older,--maybe three. And you'll have to give him credit for
      having the same wife all these years, Laura."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, why shouldn't he, Laura wondered. Why was that any
      credit to him? She thought about it a great deal. It
      worried her,--the something which was not right,--but she
      could not quite put her finger on the defect. It was a
      queer marriage,--Uncle Harry, gay and slim and debonair,
      sipping the tips of the blossoms of pleasure,--Aunt
      Carolyn, fat and old-lady-like and settled, drinking her
      tea and cuddling her hot-water bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura thought often of her father down home, working at the
      desk. She felt a great pity for him that he could not be up
      here, too. She wished he could do something that would make
      him happy and care-free and boyish. Working and working for
      other people without a great deal of compensation, always
      on the town council and the school board, always assigned
      to church and civic committees, his tasks never finished, a
      rest never earned. She wished she could do something about
      it, but not being able to, she did the next best thing--she
      sympathized with him, writing a note every day telling him
      of all their activities, never failing to add "I wish you
      were here, too." She did not know that her father put them
      all away in a private drawer in his desk where they stayed
      for years. John Deal in his silent way loved his young
      daughter deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed queer to John Deal to live alone in the empty
      house. He missed the lively chatter of the children and
      Eloise's good housekeeping. He scarcely knew what to do
      with himself on the few free evenings which were his.
      Sometimes he read, and for one whole evening he sat in a
      big chair in the living room and dozed or looked at the
      group on the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a descendant of some old sea captain has above his
      fireplace a miniature brig with sails bravely flying, to
      which he points with pride as the traditional embodiment of
      the spirit of his forefathers. John Deal had a bronze
      covered-wagon on his mantel, the oxen molded in the act of
      drawing it, well-formed and life-like, their huge horns
      tipped realistically with brass knobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise had protested the advent of the piece. There was no
      covered-wagon episode in the life of Eloise's parents, she
      said. Her people had originally come over in the
      <i>Mayflower</i> (at which John had surreptitiously grinned
      and mumbled something that sounded like "poor old
      over-loaded boat"),--they had always remained city people
      and easterners, for that matter, until her own father came
      to Iowa. She didn't think the huge clumsy bronze thing
      looked in place in what she had tried to make an
      exceptionally dainty room. If the statue were something
      graceful, now, a deer, or even the long sinuous lines of
      grayhounds; but oxen,--huge and dull-looking and
      stolid,--and a wagon with every flapping piece of canvas
      molded in the bronze. She had said a great deal about the
      price, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bronze--why bronze is terribly expensive. John Deal, how
      much did you pay for that? I'll wager anything, we couldn't
      afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, he shouldn't have afforded it. Eloise
      was right about that. It had cost an even hundred dollars,
      the entire fee of a client. But he had been attracted by it
      as he was waiting for Laura to make a small purchase; had
      stood for a long time before the little group, coveted it
      with a good healthy covetousness; had thought about it many
      times and finally gone back to get it, half in hopes that
      it was gone, half worried for fear it was. He liked to look
      up at it as he smoked, forgetting the petty quarrels of his
      country clients in remembering some of the tales his people
      had told him. Their lives seemed hard in retrospect, but
      after all, there had been something free and untrammeled
      about them, like the winds that blew over their prairie
      home. To get food to eat, fuel to burn and money to pay the
      taxes,--those seemed the greatest problems his father had.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered just how the old soddie looked,--he must have
      been eight or nine when they moved from it into the frame
      house. He could close his eyes and visualize the one main
      living room with the general bedroom off of it, the
      cookstove where they sometimes burned corn, and the deep
      seats in the two windows formed by the width of the sod
      strips. He could see his cheery mother at her endless task
      of mending the clothes, his big strong father coming in
      with the milk pails, smell the odor of cornmeal cooking,
      hear the never-ceasing wind blowing against the little
      soddie. Here he sat now in comparative comfort, complete
      luxury even, if likened to the soddie; and yet his problems
      seemed more difficult than his father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered why, with all the added comforts, there had
      been no lessening of worries. Sometimes, the difficult
      questions confronting him seemed more than humanity could
      solve. There had been the question of defending the
      guaranty law. He had gone to the legislature with the
      burdens of the depositors in the failed banks heavy upon
      him. He had the story of old Mr. and Mrs. Kleinman losing
      their life savings ringing in his ears; the pitiful tale of
      Amy Hall, the little seamstress, saving a dollar or two a
      week for twenty years only to see it swept away; almost on
      his own cheeks the tears of young Mrs. Wise who had
      deposited her husband's insurance money just before the
      crash. How could he have gone up to the legislature and not
      fought to the finish for a fund with which to reimburse
      these? It had made Mack angry. Mack and the other bankers
      were lying down on further taxation. Already they had paid
      out several million dollars. "Poured it in a rat hole" Mack
      had said. For the fund was insolvent. Weak banks had been
      allowed to run on when it was known they were weak.
      Cracking down on the first few would have saved the many,
      he had thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble was long before that," Mack had said. "Anybody
      could go out and start a bank where two roads crossed, if
      they had ten dollars and a blank book and a pencil." The
      whole thing had been bungled. People had been led to think
      the state was solidly behind their deposits. Then came the
      land slump, depression, banks crumbling,--good bankers were
      required to pay for the sins of the poor ones. It made a
      vicious circle. Mack and the others had rebelled.
      Confiscatory they called it. Unconstitutional. "No state
      has a right to take one man's property to pay another man's
      debts." Mack had said it a hundred times. They had argued
      hotly--brother against brother. "But you didn't call it
      confiscating when you were playing it up big in your ads.
      Now that it's a heavy burden you've changed your mind."
      They had grown hot in their arguments,--had lost their
      former comradeship. Civil war in the Deal family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it wasn't a question of what might have been. It was
      a question of what to do now. How to compromise. How to
      fight to get back old Mr. and Mrs. Kleinman's money with
      which to bury them, and sickly Amy Hall's savings and young
      Mrs. Wise's only fund for herself and two babies,--and at
      the same time keep the other banks solvent,--keep the whole
      system from crashing with a far greater catastrophe than
      the present one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would go over and over it, silent, brooding, with a deep
      feeling of compassion for them all. Life was like the old
      plains before the trails were made. It took initiative and
      foresight to find one's way through it. The old plainsmen
      moved through an uncharted region with only the sun and the
      stars for guidance. Their children and their children's
      children moved now through just as uncharted a wilderness.
      If only the stars and the sun could guide them, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would look up to the exquisitely done bronze
      on the mantel and feel a touch of mental uplift. It so
      typified the struggles of another day, made him realize
      that every age has its long tiresome journey. Sometimes it
      is an endless lurching over miles of dry grass and
      sunflowers, and the breaking of raw prairie sod. And
      sometimes it is an endless fighting for the peace and
      comfort of fellow men. He was glad he had bought the
      bronze.

    <h2>
      <a name="c07" id="c07">CHAPTER 7</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Laura and her mother seemed in some inexplicable way to
      draw closer together in spirit there in the north so many
      miles from home. Sometimes they walked together through the
      needle-carpeted woods. Once they came upon the remains of a
      tepee set high upon the bluffs, so that Laura was
      transported in fancy to the days when Indians lived by the
      lake. She was deep in an emotional retrospection of the
      time, when Eloise called practically: "No, Laura; look
      here. It's of recent date. The poles at the top are bound
      together with a patented wire. Scouts or Hi-Y boys! No
      Indian ever put those poles together." Laura had to admit
      defeat. But why couldn't Mother have left her the fancy?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one of these walks that Laura approached a
      subject long on her mind. She didn't want to go to the
      University--not at all. The University seemed so huge with
      its six or seven thousand students on the one campus. It
      frightened her, the very thought of it. Couldn't she stay
      home and read and write? She'd make good use of her time.
      Really, she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eloise was firm. "It's just what you <i>need,</i>
      Laura. Mother knows best. You need to mix with people. This
      is a practical world we live in. You'll just have to shake
      yourself out of that dreamy way of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      It hung over like a menacing thing; she wished she could
      stay forever in her blue and white room or out in the grape
      arbor. The middle of September grew to seem as threatening
      as some date of impending disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes, Laura, I think you're a nineteenth-century girl
      in a twentieth-century setting," her mother said in
      exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whenever it fastened its hold upon her, Laura threw off
      the thought of the dread change, preferring to live in the
      happy present and make the most of her pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in the midst of the other excitements, as though
      her experiences were not sufficient for happiness, she met
      Miss Westcote,--Miss Evelyn Westcote, the writer. Miss
      Westcote and a friend had a cottage where the pines tapped
      on the roof and inquisitive squirrels ran nimbly around the
      chimney. To one in Laura's state of mind concerning
      writing, the place seemed hallowed ground and Miss Westcote
      a goddess who had lost her way between Olympus and some
      Utopia. She spent every moment near Miss Westcote that
      propriety allowed. Sometimes she walked past her cottage
      with scarcely a glance in that direction, so that she might
      not seem to be thrusting her presence upon the writer. If
      Miss Westcote was the first to notice and invite her in,
      Laura lived in a heaven of bliss. She could not understand,
      though, why Miss Westcote seldom mentioned her writing. How
      could she turn out a book like <i>The Chime of Bells</i>
      and not talk about it? She ventured to ask her one day.
      Miss Westcote laughed in her merry way, the lids of her
      eyes crinkling. "For the same reason that the candy
      manufacturer doesn't stand and eat his own candy. We all
      like to get away from our business and forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Miss Westcote,--it isn't like a <i>business,</i>
      surely." Laura was surprised, a little disillusioned. "I
      thought it was . . . oh, always inspirational, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Westcote suddenly sobered. "I rather think it always
      is,--when one is very young. But oh, my dear," she added,
      "for such a short time does one stay young."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise, too, was delighted to meet Miss Westcote. Was she
      not to review one of Miss Westcote's novels in club that
      very fall? She was jubilant about the fact that they were
      to be thrown together for a time. "Imagine my meeting her
      here," she said to Laura. "I can question her all about it
      and get my information first hand. The ladies will
      certainly sit up and take notice of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mother," Laura was diffident about the matter. "She's
      here on a vacation. She's resting and playing around. Maybe
      she wouldn't relish an interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eloise knew better. "You can't tell me," she affirmed,
      "I'll wager there never was an author yet who didn't like
      to talk about himself and his books. I shall ask her
      beforehand of course. This is really an opportunity that I
      couldn't have dreamed would happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Westcote was quite gracious about the interview. She
      would be glad to tell Mrs. Deal any time about the writing
      of the novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise and Laura drove over to Silver Lake Corners before
      the interview to buy a notebook for the occasion. A fat man
      in a straw hat waited upon Eloise in the little general
      store that supplied the tourists' needs. People were buying
      fishlines, sinkers, rods, lures, ice-cream cones, movie
      magazines and pop, getting their mail, and sending
      postcards of pigmy-looking people nonchalantly holding up
      twenty-five pound muscallonge.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Corners they drove straight to Miss Westcote's
      cottage where they found her sitting in a long deck-chair
      busily engaged in doing nothing but gazing out on the lake
      whose waves danced under a golden shimmer in the afternoon
      sun. She rose to meet the two, pulled other lounging chairs
      forward, and slipped back comfortably into her own. Laura,
      too, made herself comfortable. But not so Eloise. She sat
      upright on the edge of her chair, pencil poised over the
      notebook, and the interview was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My first question comes under the head of 'Author's
      Motive,'" Eloise said pleasantly, briskly, "Miss Westcote,
      why did you write <i>The Chime of Bells?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," Miss Westcote said pleasantly, but not briskly,
      "you know, Mrs. Deal, there is one motive behind writing
      which all authors possess in common,--at least, after the
      first fine thrill of writing to reform the world is over
      and they have settled down to make a business of it. They
      would like to side-step the issue, and most of them do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is that?" Eloise was ready to write the answer
      verbatim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Westcote's eyes twinkled and then closed in narrow
      slits, a way they did when she was silently laughing.
      "Because we can no longer use buttons, trinkets and beads
      for trade and barter, and because writers are charged
      practically the same for food, clothing, tooth paste and
      gasoline that other people are charged; you will figure out
      for yourself what was at least one motive for writing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed, but Eloise looked a little pained, so that
      Miss Westcote said hastily: "But that's too sordid a motive
      for you to tell your club, isn't it? And now I'll give you
      a more literary sounding reason." And Eloise copied her
      words verbatim in the little black book.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, "Who are your primary characters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was easy, and Miss Westcote named them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your secondary characters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Scratch--scratch in the little black book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your tertiary characters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Westcote's eyes narrowed again into quivering slits.
      "My dear Mrs. Deal, you're getting me worried. Is there
      such a word as 'quartuary' for the fourth in importance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise said she thought there was one with that meaning,
      although she had her doubts about it being that particular
      word. "And I rather think the three . . . the three . . .
      what shall I call them . . . ?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Layers," Miss Westcote suggested, her eyes crinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sets," Eloise corrected. "I rather think the three sets of
      characters are enough to report."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," agreed the creator of those characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for the questions," Eloise was businesslike, thorough.
      A bombardment followed: "What do you consider your chapter
      of climax?" "What are the main crises before the climax?"
      "What were your controlling factors in plot formation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Westcote later related the incident to the friend
      sharing the cottage: "She had me completely floored. I
      could scarcely remember the names of the characters. If
      there was a climax I had mislaid the thing. I couldn't have
      sworn absolutely that I wrote it. In a maze of academic
      questions, she had destroyed my poor little story. It was
      dead,--killed on the dissecting table under an ansthetic.
      If a story, Blanche, is worth milling over in a meeting at
      all, it's worth reviewing as a thing of flesh and blood and
      spirit rather than of bones and dead tissue and numerical
      dimensions. The girl was darling, sweet and
      understanding,--but the mother,--one of those highly
      efficient women who would have arranged the stars in
      symmetrical rows and dispensed with the milky way as being
      too messy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end of the second week, Uncle Harry grew
      restless and irritable. Aunt Carolyn seemed striving to be
      carefully tactful. She began inquiring about a hotel in
      northern Wisconsin, casually speaking of the delights to be
      encountered there as related to her by some young woman who
      had been a guest the year before. Uncle Harry became
      interested, cheerful. With much commotion and questioning
      he collected data about it: distance, roads to take,
      prices, conveniences, kind of people there. He spent a long
      time sitting on the steps leading down to the dock with the
      young woman who had given Aunt Carolyn the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two weeks were over, the beautiful two weeks. Laura
      thought she could not stand it, never again to see the
      lovely birches and the winding roads, smell the pungent
      green pines and hear the lapping of the cool blue water.
      She felt sad and depressed with that emotional thrill which
      always accompanied the sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went over to see Miss Westcote and to bid her good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell what it has meant to meet you, Miss
      Westcote." Laura's serious brown eyes met the kindly
      twinkling ones of the older woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I've loved knowing you, too," Miss Westcote was
      saying. She held Laura's hand. "Keep up your writing. Write
      the things you know and understand . . ." She smiled down
      on her, ". . . your own prairies and your own people. Write
      it in your own way . . . the way <i>you</i> see it. Don't
      imitate or copy . . . you wouldn't do that with words . . .
      but don't even do so with the spirit of the thing. Don't
      try to look at your own prairies and your own people as an
      outsider does. Interpret them as <i>you</i> feel about them
      . . . knowing that there will be others who see and feel as
      you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura wanted to talk more, to ask a dozen questions, to
      tell this wise woman many things that were close to her
      heart. She wanted to throw open the rooms of her mind and
      take the thoughts out one by one and show them to Miss
      Westcote. She wanted to repeat to her the verses she had
      run across after her grandmother's death, to tell her that
      no one had ever held her complete confidence since that
      time, to confide in her about the wonderful magic dreams
      and desires she and Grandmother used to discuss, to make
      her understand that all there was to see now was a white
      bird flying. But she felt that old tight-throated sense of
      restraint, and only thanked her, told her she would do the
      best she could, and said good-by. When she turned away and
      walked down the little path where the pine needles lay like
      a thick brown rug, she felt that nothing in the world could
      keep her from making another Miss Westcote of herself, that
      she would never let anything in life handicap her or swerve
      her from the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they parted--the Deals were to go home by train at the
      Wentworths' expense--Uncle Harry held Laura's hand and
      kissed her twice. "You're coming with me again. You're
      coming East to stay with me awhile," he said suddenly, as
      though he had just thought of it, "isn't she, Carolyn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Carolyn smiled and said yes, that would be lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Harry grew more enthusiastic. He went up and down,
      see-saw fashion, on his slim immaculate heels and toes.
      "I'll send for you. Soon. She can come, can't she, Eloise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was pleased and made no effort to hide it. "It would
      be the making of her." She was earnest and grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll drop you a line when the time comes. And send you a
      check. I wouldn't want my little girl to be at any expense
      when she's visiting me." He shook hands again. He sprang on
      to the running board and into the car, tilting his youthful
      hat jauntily, winking a bright brown eye at Laura, wagging
      a slim, highly polished finger at her and saying: "You'll
      hear from me, you rascal. Probably next summer, you'll hear
      from your Uncle Harry. It'll be fun to have you there--and
      a lot of your friends around."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Carolyn settled herself heavily in the big car, with
      Annette fixing cushions and the footrest. She had on a
      loose shapeless dress for comfort in riding and wide flat
      oxfords.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big car drove off with Uncle Harry waving his jaunty,
      boyish hat. Laura felt depressed. There was something
      wrong--something terribly wrong there--but she did not know
      just what it was. Marriage ought not to be like that.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="c08" id="c08">CHAPTER 8</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When they were back in Cedartown, slipping comfortably into
      the old routine, Laura realized that she was being swept
      along in the stream of preparation that emptied as it were
      into the great gulf of the University. It seemed a terrible
      thing that she could not stop it. Why couldn't people do
      what they wished? Sometimes she walked past the big brick
      High School where she had spent so many years, and looked
      longingly at the old building as one looks at the familiar
      face of a friend. She fancied it looked kind, motherly,
      almost compassionate that she was to go away. Strangely
      enough she failed to remember that she once felt the same
      temerity upon entering its portals that she was now
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clan all discussed her, long and openly, at Katherine's
      on a Sunday afternoon in August. The lovely little English
      home was full of Deals: Aunt Margaret and Uncle "Doc" Baker
      and Grace Deal, who was teaching in the University now,
      were there from Lincoln. Aunt Isabelle and Uncle Harrison
      Rhodes were there on their annual trip out from Chicago.
      Uncle Mackenzie and Aunt Emma Deal, their son Stanley and
      his wife and two children were there from Omaha. John,
      Eloise, Laura and Trib were all there, as well as Jimmie,
      Katherine and little Patty, six months old now and the
      center of attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going into a sorority, I suppose, Laura?" It was Aunt Emma
      who inadvertently began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise immediately answered for her. "Oh, yes, Laura's
      going into a sorority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," Laura was disturbed, embarrassed. "I don't know
      that I would be <i>taken."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's mouth set in a firm line. "I think you'll be taken
      all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did mother say that out before every one? She might
      <i>not</i> be pledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others had something to say. Immediately it became the
      topic of conversation. The Deals were always like
      that--noisy and argumentative, each one sharpening his wits
      against the other's judgment. There was diversity of
      opinion here. Jimmie Buchanan, Uncle Doc Baker and John
      Deal were decidedly anti-fraternity. Eloise, Aunt Margaret,
      Aunt Emma, Katherine, Stanley Deal and his wife were all
      Greek letter advocates. Because it had no direct bearing on
      music, the Rhodeses were not especially active in the
      discussion. Uncle Mack was neutral,--dipping in here and
      there on either side. Grace Deal, who said she ought to
      know, inasmuch as she taught there, declared they were
      necessary evils. "I don't like everything about them . . .
      but just suggest something constructive to take their
      place. You can't criticize without substituting some
      constructive idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dormitories . . . treat everybody alike. I've been working
      for that move for a long time." It was John Deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of all utterly snobbish outfits the frats get the
      hand-crocheted waffle-iron," was Jimmie Buchanan's verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they ought to be abolished entirely. Think of a
      democratic tax-supported institution . . . and a decent
      taxpayer's son can't go up there without . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, John," it was Margaret Baker, "it's human nature to
      form in cliques. Seven thousand people can't all go
      together in one nice democratic crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it . . . there you are . . . that's the answer,"
      several said triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine had something to add: "People <i>will</i> run in
      bunches. Say the charters were all taken away to-morrow,
      Uncle John, and the chapter houses turned over to the
      University . . . if that were possible . . . by next Sunday
      the crowds living in them would have reorganized and have
      new names: 'The Apache Indians,' or 'The Ancient Arabs' and
      'The Dirty Devils.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one laughed at that, and it temporarily cleared the
      atmosphere which was becoming warmer with slight
      indications of a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathie's right," Eloise put in, "I'll say it's better to
      be organized nationally with creeds and supervisors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe it's all right for the East with their older
      traditions, but here in this democratic Midwest . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where men are men and women are W.C.T.U. members,"
      Katherine inserted with her usual flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look what the fraternity did for Allen Rinemiller in the
      time he was there," some one said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise snorted. "You can't get away from your grandmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," Jimmie Buchanan took it up. "That's a frat for
      you--pounced on a green country kid like Allen because of
      his fine athletic record. He makes a few important plays
      and the frat sits back on its haunches and takes all the
      glory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Jimmie, look what it did for him socially--took the
      shine off his hair and put it on his shoes--got his hair
      cut right--put him in a tuxedo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Pi Tau house--you can't put a fellow in a house
      furnished like that and not have his standards of living
      raised. The Pi Tau house is a beauty--it looks like a
      church, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! Ha! That's pretty good." It was Jimmie Buchanan,
      again. <i>"Looks</i> like a church maybe . . ." And he went
      off into a personal and private gale of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allen's going back again now," Laura volunteered. "I met
      him yesterday on the street and he told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the subject long and noisily--the Deals.
      They were like that, full of interest toward all that was
      going on around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the brisk debate, there was a tap-tapping
      sound on the cement sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Oscar," Emma said with supreme resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now the shouting and the tumult will die," Katherine
      predicted, "and we'll hear a little about the original
      brotherhood of fraternities, . . . the Ancient Order of Ox
      Drivers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man came in smiling, his black hat in his hand, in
      his shabby coat the G.A.R. button and "68." He felt a great
      happiness to see so many of his old friends' children and
      their children in one group, a deep gratification that he
      had taken the notion to walk down here just at this time.
      He had brought lettuce to Kathie in the pail with a rope
      for the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Jimmie held a chair ready for him, the old man
      stood in the middle of the room leaning on his cane and
      looking into all their faces. "There's about as many of you
      here as there was the time your father and my brother Henry
      and I fixed up a wagon to haul the whole neighborhood down
      to Weeping Water. I mind as how at the County fair they was
      goin' to give a prize to the precinct that could get up the
      largest representation. Well, sir, Will Deal and Henry and
      me put our heads together and said old Stove Creek precinct
      would just naturally come home with that money. Took boards
      and spliced out the longest wagon box you ever see . . .
      had four team of oxen on it . . ." Every one was avoiding
      Kathie's laughing eyes. "Piled all the Deals and the Lutzes
      and the Reinmuellers and some others in 'n' drove to the
      fair. You should o' heard 'em shout when we come. Equipage
      was so long we couldn't turn around . . . had to go on
      through the little street and turn around on the prairie
      beyond the town. Had Henry and Sarah's melodeon in the
      front . . . Abbie Deal was playin' the accompaniment to
      'Red, White and Blue' and 'Columby the Gem of the Ocean.'
      Wagon was so long they couldn't keep together in their
      singin'. Will Deal and I was drivin' the ox teams. And
      Henry would run along side 'n' yell: 'Ready--set--sing.'
      Once Henry come up to the back end and says: 'Darn it. Quit
      singin' that <i>Who Will Lead Me Home To Heaven</i>--the
      front end's singin' <i>Three Blind Mice</i>.'" And he
      slapped his knee and chuckled over the pleasant memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      If John Deal did not care about his daughter going Greek,
      Eloise had no greater desire than that she would. Laura
      knew which one would win, providing she were invited. She
      added the last always, feeling very young and
      unsophisticated and not having any too much confidence in
      her own appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the next week party bids began arriving. Laura was
      surprised beyond measure. It seemed unbelievable. Eloise
      was not surprised and there was nothing unbelievable about
      the daughter of a Wentworth having plenty of invitations.
      She was planning to go to Lincoln with Laura to see that
      the affair was engineered correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't trust Laura to see the thing through herself,"
      she said to John. "She's such a day dreamer, and she seems
      to care about almost nothing about getting on socially.
      She'd be apt to forget to keep her most important house
      bids. There are the Chi Taus now . . . wealthy girls . . .
      and the Alpha Betas . . . <i>family</i> counts the most
      there . . . the Gamma Zetas are a lively bunch, prominent
      socially . . . the Rho Phis are awfully good
      nationally--she has party bids from them all . . . and it's
      of the utmost importance that she make one of these."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is it?" John wanted to know. "Laura's a nice
      kid--she'll make friends anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you would say that. I suppose you think she
      could go up there--and just study--and make a few frowsy
      friends . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a faint notion we were sending her up there <i>to
      study.</i> When I was in the University . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we know. You curried Dr. Overman's horses and stoked
      the Chancellor's furnace . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And made plenty of good substantial friends . . ." he
      returned warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Laura can't stoke furnaces . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody wants her to work her way when she doesn't have to
      . . . but it seems to me you put a lot of stress on the
      social side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, and there's plenty of reason for it. Listen to me,
      John Deal. You're a man and couldn't be expected to have
      the intuition a mother has. Practically every girl who
      leaves school, leaves it engaged. Now I'm far-sighted
      enough to prepare for that. If she goes Alpha Beta or Gamma
      Zeta or one of those--whom will she meet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to answer her own question: "The brothers and
      the friends of Alpha Beta or Gamma Zetas. See? It's as
      simple as daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where's the assurance that the brothers and the
      friends are going to be so all-fired nice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was too much for Eloise. If one could not
      comprehend the superiority of the brothers and the friends
      of Alpha Beta or Gamma Zeta--there was simply no use
      discussing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Eloise fitted Laura out in pretty new clothes, and armed
      with the party invitations and her own efficient
      management, accompanied her to school.
    </p>
    <p>
      John hated to see his little girl go. She was only
      seventeen. The school seemed so huge. Would she come back
      to him still sweet and unspoiled? Or snobbish and
      sophisticated? He wanted to tell her how much he loved her,
      how proud he was of her little talent, how happy he wanted
      her always to be. But he could not bring himself to say any
      of those things. He only pinched her cheek and waved his
      hand to her cheerfully, when she left. The more deeply he
      felt anything, the less articulate he was. He had always
      been that way, and Laura was like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise and her ewe lamb stayed at a leading hotel during
      the rush week. Aunt Margaret Baker had offered them the
      hospitality of her lovely home, but Eloise said no, they
      would be right down town ready for anything that came up.
      And plenty of things came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was herded to breakfasts and luncheons and dinners,
      to afternoon teas and evening parties. Some of the chapter
      houses were gorgeous in their furnishings. One or two were
      not quite finished so that they stepped over lath and
      plaster in part of the rooms. There seem always to be lath
      and plaster on the campuses of midwest colleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura could not quite understand the queer quality of the
      atmosphere. There was something about it she had never
      experienced before--something tense and important, as
      though every one's welfare hung in the balance. Nerves
      seemed taut, manners strained. An exterior of convention
      seemed to cover something primitive that might at any
      moment break its leash and bound out. Girls she had never
      seen before put their arms around her. Many told her she
      was a darling. Some confided that, honestly, she was the
      keenest girl that had been in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura said to herself: "That isn't so. I can see right
      through them."
    </p>
    <p>
      But some of the girls had other qualities,--graciousness
      that seemed a part of them and not assumed, sincerity that
      showed in their conversation. Some were jolly with
      infectious laughter. At first, Laura met them curiously
      with some attention to their various characteristics; but
      after a time she grew tired, confused, unable to tell the
      ones she fancied from those she did not. And once in the
      mad rush, her mother happened to remember that Laura must
      go to the huge Coliseum to register for classes. It seemed
      a waste of time to Eloise, but after all, it was quite true
      that the studies must be given some thought also.
      Registration was effected with no casualties, although it
      was well for Laura that her own chosen course carried no
      science of number and quantity and all their respective
      relations. It was very trying, and in the midst of the
      confusion, she sometimes longed for an hour in which she
      could go out in the grape arbor of their back yard, and sit
      and read and think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rushing parties were all over at last, and, in the
      temporary shelter of the hotel room the potential author
      shed nervous tears. She was so bewildered, she told her
      mother, she hadn't the faintest idea with which group she
      wanted to align herself. But Eloise chose for her. "Alpha
      Beta," she said unhesitatingly, firmly. "That's your first
      choice, Laura. I do hope they will take you. It seemed the
      last word to me in an aristocratic group. Gamma Zeta is
      your second choice, and Rho Phi third. When you turn in
      your list, that's the way they are to be listed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where'll I live if not any of those three bid me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's nostrils quivered, and her mouth became a firm
      straight line. One might have wondered if the whole system
      did not totter perilously in that moment. But the old order
      of things was happily preserved, for Laura went Alpha Beta.
      A little frightened and decidedly homesick, she was towed
      to the house at the specified time by Eloise, triumphant
      and self-complacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alpha Beta house was old, and like Westminster Abbey,
      fruit cake, and wine, all the better for that. In fact, its
      very antiquity gave it an air of superiority which is the
      <i>ultima thule</i> of attainment at colleges west of the
      Missouri, in some of which Time has not played so long in
      the cast that he has called in his partner, Tradition. The
      house had an atmosphere of mellowed aristocracy which
      exactly suited Eloise's aspirations for Laura. The white
      woodwork and mahogany doors, the delft blue hangings,
      soft-toned rugs and fat old furniture in the living rooms,
      the quaint chintzes in the sunrooms, the rather
      old-fashioned furnishings of the bedrooms all seemed
      combining to make capital of the fact that they represented
      one of the first chapters on the campus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was satisfied. And as she did after most attainments
      of the John Deal family, cut another notch in the gun of
      her own efficient management; although as a matter of fact,
      if the interior of Eloise's mind had been disclosed to the
      chapter, nothing would so certainly have lost Laura her bid
      as the knowledge that her mother had definitely picked
      Alpha Beta for Laura, before Alpha Beta had done its own
      picking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Eloise said good-by to her Alpha Beta pledge in the
      wide open spaces of the lower hall where the stairway with
      the dull mahogany handrail curved up to the higher regions,
      Laura thought she could not stand it to see her mother go.
      Not especially companionable in the deeper sense, Eloise
      was a good mother, and Laura felt closer to her at the
      farewells than she had ever felt before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I'd planned to stay home a year before I came,"
      Laura was winking fast, now that the parting time had come.
      Her mouth was trembling. But Eloise kept a stiff upper lip.
      "You will be very happy here. Just think what mother has
      accomplished for you"--(the Alpha Betas should have heard
      that)--"I've got you in what has seemed to me <i>the</i>
      very best one of all. You'll meet the best people. And
      maybe" . . . Eloise was archly playful: "maybe you'll have
      a nice young man some day . . . the brother or cousin of
      one of these aristocratic girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no." Eloise could not have said it at a more
      inopportune time. "Oh, no, I don't care for men,
      Mother--not <i>at all.</i> I really don't. You don't
      understand. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Laura was genuinely distressed, Eloise changed
      her tactics. "After all, I can't say that you are
      especially attractive that way, Laura." She was the
      personification of tact. "So just keep your mind on your
      studies. Good-by now . . . keep your head up . . . don't
      let any one run over you. The Deals are all good capable
      people--you don't need to be ashamed of the name Deal. Your
      father has been in legislature. Your Uncle Mack is a banker
      in Omaha, your Aunt Grace on the University faculty, your
      Aunt Margaret a leading physician's wife here in Lincoln,
      your Aunt Isabelle a music teacher in Chicago." Eloise
      tabulated them as though it were all news to Laura. "The
      Deals are all decent, capable people--and above all that,
      remember <i>your mother was a Wentworth."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this parting dose of nerve stimulant, Eloise placed
      her small-town child in the lap of the gods. And University
      life had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She probably wouldn't have made it," Eloise said
      complacently to John on her return, "if I hadn't gone. She
      was almost ready to give up making a decision."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what if she had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she had . . ." Eloise lowered her voice in the hushed
      tones one associates with grief and bereavement, "if she
      had, <i>she might never have been bid again."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Laura went Alpha Beta. But some did not. One girl was
      not taken on account of her freckles, one had been
      tabulated a crock the moment she stepped inside the door,
      and another had made the fatal error of eating a bite or
      two of the garnishing on her salad. In the four years of
      their schooling, Laura saw the tan spots miraculously fade
      into the background of a pink and white complexion, the
      crock become the May queen, and the lotus-eater--no,
      lettuce-eater--earn the Phi Beta Kappa key. But it's a wise
      sorority that knows its own child, and no fraternity can
      read all there is in the stars and the crystal ball in one
      mad week of rushing.

    <h2>
      <a name="c09" id="c09">CHAPTER 9</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the game of roommates--in which game the freshmen are
      the pawns--Laura was given into the care of a
      sophomore--one Bernice Fowler--a brisk capable girl with so
      many of the characteristics of Laura's own efficient mother
      that one might have wondered if the two girls had not been
      interchanged at birth. Laura had not lived with her a full
      day until she had altered the position of all the furniture
      in the room, rearranged Laura's hair, ripped a lace collar
      off one of Laura's dresses and instructed her to wear brown
      beads with it instead, discussed a change of music teachers
      for her, and run over a list of male acquaintances to pick
      out a boy friend for her. By evening Laura also had
      received her first lesson in fraternal rivalry. Standing at
      the window of their room on third, she asked guilelessly:
      "Why are there so many cars all around the Gamma Zeta
      house?" To which Bernice Fowler said significantly: "It's
      probably because there's a stop button there. There are
      <i>never</i> more cars around the Gamma house than around
      ours. Remember that."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of one month, Laura's newly acquired knowledge
      consisted of a few French words, the fact that she did not
      stand correctly in Phys. Ed., that there is much more to
      the science of botany than pressing flowers collected along
      old Stove Creek, that all men are not born free and equal,
      that all Alpha Betas are God's own children, that Pi Tau
      men rate much higher than Tau Phis, that Omega Gammas are
      the lowest species in the genus Greek, and that a barb is a
      microscopic organism of the animal kingdom. To be sure,
      some of this instruction did not assimilate easily. And
      when food or instruction do not digest readily, they cause
      distress if they can not be thrown off. Laura was
      sensitive, deeply responsive to the feelings of all humans
      with whom she came in contact; and this being so, she could
      neither wholly believe nor totally disregard. So she
      suffered a little in characteristic silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the first semester she was quite depressed concerning
      life. But gradually when it was borne in upon her that most
      barbs wanted no sympathy, that large numbers of them were
      actually without the pale by choice; that the lowly Omega
      Gamma men, who did not rate well, laughed and sang and
      danced and slapped each other jovially on their respective
      lowly backs and gave every evidence of wholeheartedly
      enjoying life; that some of her own exclusive Alpha Beta
      sisters had periods of depression, homesickness, no dating,
      deflated pocketbooks, and disappointments; the world began
      to swing back into its natural orbit. Life was queer. But
      it was somewhat gaining its equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times she met Allen Rinemiller on the campus. Allen
      looked very collegiate in his up-to-date clothes. And
      evidently he was popular, for he was always with football
      boys whose names were familiar to every one,--fellows who
      were known for their campus activities--or prominent
      sorority girls. Always they spoke, and once or twice Allen
      dropped out of the group he was with and talked to her a
      minute. The first time he did so Laura experienced a queer
      sensation, for although she despised herself for the
      snobbish thought, it came to her mind that their places
      were changed here,--that at home a Deal was a bigger person
      than a Rinemiller, but that here a Deal was quite grateful
      for a little attention from a Rinemiller. And when she
      attended the football games with a bunch of Alpha Betas and
      saw Allen, big and grimy and dependable, get through the
      solid phalanx of the enemies' lines, with the entire
      stadium gone wild, she felt quite important to think he was
      from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some girls are apparently born with dates; some through
      much personal activity, achieve them; but others seem by
      necessity to have dates thrust upon them. By going home for
      week-ends all fall, Laura evaded the dating question for
      which she had no great hankering, but by the time their own
      formal party was to be staged, it became apparent that she
      must have a date thrust upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernice Fowler secured this necessary equipment. And Laura
      was not overwhelmed with the gratitude Bernice seemed to
      consider her due. She dreaded the ordeal much more than she
      anticipated it with pleasure. She had no gift of small
      talk. More than ever she was realizing how much like her
      father she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise saw that Laura had a pretty new gown. It was soft
      ivory silk, simply made on graceful lines, but all the more
      fetching for its simplicity. The "date" was a mere
      freshman, but in the abstract and unknown he presented to
      Laura all the horrible prospect of a masculine Gorgon. But
      when he was announced and she went down to the lower hall
      to meet him, seeing him in the flesh,--and more bone than
      flesh at that,--boyish and nervous in his tuxedo, in her
      characteristic way, she suddenly felt tactful and at ease
      with him. She wondered why she always felt that way toward
      boys, almost motherly. He seemed nothing to her so much as
      Trib grown tall and dressed up, painfully trying to please
      her. When he smoked pompously, and spoke darkly of wild
      parties his frat had thrown, she sensed that he was not
      quite used to it all yet, so that she wanted to laugh and
      tell him not to take the trouble to impress her with his
      worldliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formal at a big hotel was an elaborate affair. Your
      Cornhuskers and Jayhawkers and Hawkeyes are not entirely
      what their names imply. Elaborate gowns and decorations and
      imported musicians made up the ensemble. Because they have
      been doing this kind of social thing a less number of years
      than their eastern prototypes, perhaps they stress the
      settings even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen Rinemiller was there with one Delores Thaxter, a
      Gamma Zeta. It was the first time Laura had seen Allen in
      evening clothes, and Allen in evening clothes was Apollo in
      a tuxedo. His superb well-built physique, his jolly
      clean-cut countenance, his blonde hair with its three
      distinct waves, his flippant ease with every one,--Laura
      thought she had never seen a man look nicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made as ideal looking a couple as Jimmie and
      Katherine, Laura decided,--Allen and that Delores Thaxter.
      The girl was in dark red velvet. She was a sophisticated
      looking young woman from Central High in Omaha, and had
      been used to social affairs all her life. Her older sister
      had been a friend of Kathie's,--they had been duchesses or
      princesses or something important together at the same
      Ak-Sar-Ben ball. While she was lovely to look upon, Laura
      decided she did not like her. She made her think of a cat
      rubbing her sleek head against Allen. "I can almost hear
      her purr," Laura said to herself as she danced with her
      bony freshman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they accidentally bumped into Allen and Delores on the
      crowded dance floor, Miss Thaxter threw out a little
      annoyed frown at them, but Allen laughed, "Hello there,
      Laura . . . traffic's congested," and went on his pleasant
      terpsichorean way. Laura could not help but think of Allen
      in a tux there on the dance floor with the haughty Omaha
      girl in comparison with what her grandmother had told her
      about old Gus and Christine Reinmueller coming into
      Nebraska in a wagon which had been constructed from a
      rowboat, the bow facing the stolid oxen, the stem forming
      the base of the canvas doorway. It made her smile to
      herself to think of the change in the three generations.
      Nebraska had certainly been a melting-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What brings out the dimples, ducky?" It was her
      worldly-wise escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Oh, how silly!</i> "Pardon! My mistake," Laura said
      coolly, and began analyzing herself even as she danced. Why
      was she different? Most girls would have <i>liked</i> that
      simple kid's remark. Yes, she guessed people were
      right,--she was odd.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then by some shifting which Allen seemed to manipulate,
      the freshman, who knew Delores Thaxter slightly, was to
      dance with her, and Allen with Laura. But dancing with
      Allen proved to be more painful than dancing with the
      freshman. She could talk generalities to the freshman, but
      coming from the same community as she and Allen did, there
      seemed nothing for her to say except things that pertained
      to home. And she could scarcely talk about Christine
      Reinmueller or his old girl, Verna Conden. Allen was a good
      dancer and she would have enjoyed it but for that terrible
      restriction on conversation which took hold of her.
      Everything that came to her mind to say seemed
      uninteresting, and her tightly constricted throat seemed in
      league with her dull mind. So aside from a few brief
      answers to Allen's pleasant remarks, she had nothing to
      offer and quite in relief saw him go back to the dashing
      Delores, who from her animated appearance was in no way at
      a loss for small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freshman took her to supper in that nervous am-I-
      pleasing-you manner which he had shown from the first of
      their meeting. He did everything correctly with the chairs,
      the silver, the tipping, the wraps, but in a sort of tense
      manner as one who is doing something he has learned by
      rote. "His fraternity is doing a good job," Laura told
      Bernice Fowler. "But he made me think of some one driving a
      car who sits stiffly at the wheel and never takes his eyes
      from the road." Bernice was impatient with Laura's report.
      She had spent quite a little time and no small amount of
      diplomacy in arranging the affair, and she did not choose
      to have it looked upon lightly. In countries where
      matrimonial affairs are arranged by a third party, Bernice
      would have made an excellent go-between.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a nice man,--from one of the oldest pioneer Nebraska
      City families, and if he pays you any further attention,
      you grab it," was her sisterly advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of our pioneer families in Nebraska are all of three
      generations old," Laura returned, "and if you call him a
      man, then Allen Rinemiller is ready for the old folks'
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought on a discussion about Allen. Two other girls, a
      Dresden-china blonde and a tall Carmen-looking one, were
      curled up in the two biggest chairs in the room. They were
      agreed in saying that Allen was one of the keenest men on
      the campus. Laura swung an active leg from a daybed and
      informed them: "Allen's grandfather and grandmother, old
      Mr. and Mrs. Reinmueller and my grandparents, the Deals,
      came into the state the very same day about sixty years
      ago. A Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lutz,--those were my Aunt Emma's
      parents--and a Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Lutz--they all met--in
      their covered wagons, you know,--at Plattsmouth or Weeping
      Water or some place along there, and came on to their land
      together where they settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they all lived together in a little crooked house?"
      chirped the blonde.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did not," said Laura. "They built two little frame
      houses and a soddie and a dugout in the side of a ravine,
      and Allen Rinemiller's granddad was the one that lived in
      the dugout."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you <i>feature</i> it? <i>Can</i> you feature it?
      Imagine,--that ritzy looking Pi Tau man! Who could believe
      it,--his grandfather living in a <i>dugout?</i> I never
      heard anything so perfectly unbelievable," said the Carmen
      girl, whose grandfather had hauled hogs dead from cholera
      to an oil factory in Lincoln all one summer for five
      dollars a load.

      Laura's first year at the University was over--a year of
      readjustments, perhaps, more than of accomplishments. She
      passed the minimum of required grades by a good margin, but
      with no apparent prospects of a P.B.K. ever coming to rest
      on the lapel of her jacket. She had made some friends,
      assimilated a certain amount of fairly important
      information, and learned to concentrate in the midst of
      buzzing, laughing, crying, whistling, singing, typing and
      arguing. She wore an Alpha Beta pearl-encrusted insignia on
      her breast and carried home the pleasant memories of
      freshman friendships, and the unpleasant ones of freshman
      disillusions. She had teachers who were apparently as kind
      to her as though she were not one of dozens who felt that
      they could write.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Deal was pleased with his young daughter. He saw no
      apparent change in her, and felt a little conscious-smitten
      that he had predicted such a thing. This was not
      surprising, for the greatest change that had taken place in
      Laura was not visible. For a year she had lived with girls
      who had traveled more or less. For a year she had listened
      to instructors speak casually of the East and Europe. The
      greatest change then in Laura Deal was that no longer did
      Cedartown seem satisfying. No longer would a blue and white
      room and an old grape arbor constitute a world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after she returned, Laura went immediately to see
      every one, as though she had just come from far countries
      instead of the distance a car could drive in a single hour.
      She met old Christine Reinmueller on the street and stopped
      to talk to her. Old Christine with her flat braided hair
      and blue calico dress, seemed more gentle, she
      thought,--mellowed the last year, as though in preparing to
      part with life she had grown tender toward it. Once, as she
      was talking, she wiped her hard old hand across her eyes.
      She spoke deprecatingly of Allen,--the big
      <i>faul</i>--lazy,--he was all for graduating from the
      University, such a <i>fehler</i>--mistake. But even as she
      spoke, Laura saw the gleam in her watery blue eye, detected
      that she was as proud of him as a peacock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Kathie's, she found Patty, sixteen months old now, as
      sweet as babies of that age usually are. Kathie, herself,
      was leaving for a bridge afternoon. "Oh, Kathie, how can
      you leave her just when she's so cunning?" Laura wanted to
      know, as Patty toddled back and forth in the nursery and
      did funny slobbery things with her pink mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine laughed shortly, "Old-fashioned as ever, Lolly. I
      thought the Alpha Betas would take some of that out of you.
      I suppose you'd have me stay at home and watch over her
      like a mother hen and her chicken. No, I have this new
      Verna trained like a seal. She's awfully good with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's Verna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl--a Verna Conden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verna Conden? She <i>works</i> for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know--I just was surprised. She used to be so
      pretty and popular in High School."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she's pretty yet. But I don't know anything about
      her popularity. If she gets her work done and takes good
      care of Patty, it's all I want to know. And don't you get
      it in your little brown head that I'm neglecting my baby. I
      have Dr. Rayburn look her over at stated periods. Dr. Moss
      is watching her teeth,--and she's on as regular diet as the
      champion heavy-weight. The modern mother puts it all over
      the antebellum one, Lolly, and so kindly remove that
      critical beam I see in your eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck Laura that Katherine was really irritated, that
      she was genuinely offended at her innocent remark. When she
      was leaving, Verna Conden, in a cap and apron, came quietly
      around the side of the house and called to her softly,
      "Laura, may I speak to you a minute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Verna,--how are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm all right. I wanted to ask you something." She was
      embarrassed. Her hard brown eyes looked at Laura with level
      familiarity a moment and then dropped. "Does Allen--go with
      any one at the University?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Verna!" It was Laura's turn for confession. "It's
      different at the University--you know--every one dates. No
      one thinks anything about it. I scarcely ever see Allen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all I wanted. Thanks. I know now." And she turned
      and slipped back to the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went home depressed. Verna still liked Allen. Poor
      Verna, in her cap and apron, working for Kathie. And Allen,
      who was so popular at school,--a "ritzy Pi Tau man," dating
      Delores Thaxter. It was too bad. Things were awfully turned
      around in life sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home she spoke to her mother about Kathie's flare-up
      when leaving Patty was mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's mouth drew into a firm line. "You stepped on her
      toes, unintentionally, Laura. I'm glad you said it though.
      She just gads, gads, gads. That Verna Conden ought not have
      so much charge of that child. Jimmie doesn't like it. He
      takes more care of Patty right now than Kathie." Eloise
      dilated at length on what seemed to her crass neglect of a
      child. Laura was sorry she had started her mother off, for
      she was genuinely fond of Kathie and hated to hear her
      criticized so forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over at old Oscar Lutz's Laura found him on the side porch
      watching the Cedartown small stream of life go by. He was
      delighted to see her, and talked steadily in his high
      voice. It was about odds and ends of things, with no
      special correlation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had plenty of gum to chew and didn't have to buy it in no
      pink or silver paper neither. Take a can and go out on the
      prairies, find some rosin-weed--looked like little
      sunflowers,--just help yourself to gum that oozed out on
      the stalks. She liked it . . . get it for her lots o' times
      . . ." Laura, listening, knew who "she" was--wondered idly
      how it would seem to have thought so much of a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he was off on another tangent, although
      whatever reminded him of it Laura could not see: "I mind
      how the dust storm of '82 come up. She and I was on the way
      to old man Norton's funeral. Dust so thick, couldn't see
      ahead of us. She sat in the end of the wagon with Christine
      Reinmueller . . . Gus couldn't go and so we took Christine
      . . . all at once a horse come up and put its head right
      between her and Christine. They squealed right proper . . .
      guess the horse was every bit as surprised as Marthy and
      Christine."
    </p>
    <p>
      In whatever he related, interwoven through all his talk,
      like a little silver song of accompaniment went the name of
      Marthy. He was always relating things that she had said,
      and laughing that thin high laugh about them. Laura
      sometimes secretly wondered why it was that he was not sad.
      How could he laugh so heartily? If you loved some one and
      that person died . . . how could you ever afterward be
      anything but grieving? And now he was saying: "I was
      telling her just yesterday . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Laura ventured it: "Who, Uncle Oscar? Telling
      whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in surprise, "Why, Marthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Uncle Oscar, it couldn't have been just yesterday. How
      can you say that when she isn't here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked startled for a moment. "That's right," he said,
      as one who has suddenly admitted it. "She ain't here."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a brief time he sat leaning forward on his cane, so
      that Laura was angry with herself that she had said so
      cruel a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," he began, "you see they just never leave you
      entirely. Now take me . . . I set here on the porch . . .
      and she seems to be working inside. When I'm inside, I just
      think of her as being out in the yard for a minute . . .
      sometimes I can hear her shut the door and go about her
      work. Tain't so, I know,--don't think I'm off in my head .
      . . but it pleases an old man's fancies. And when the
      lilacs come out . . . always associate her with lilacs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura left him sitting there saying: "Yes, it pleases an
      old man's fancies."

      Youth sees life as a plot, a gay, romantic adventuresome
      plot. But they who have lived past their youthfulness, know
      that life does not arrange itself forever in well-defined
      patterns, nor does it always arrive at solutions. Life is
      like a river--a groping, pulsing river, endlessly rising
      and falling, finding its way through mists and shadows to
      some far sea. Every human is a part of the interminable
      flow. Every human is a part of the story. One life touches
      another and is gone. There is contact for a brief time,--an
      influence for good or ill. And the river goes on, endlessly
      rising and falling, finding its way to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura's sophomore and junior years carried her a little
      farther toward that unknown shore, other lives touching her
      own, leaving their imprint. Classes in Narration and
      English Composition turned to Poetics and Advanced
      Narration. Philosophy and Child Psychology were left
      behind. Psychology of the Emotions and Mental Hygiene
      entered. Laura moved down on second floor and back on
      third. She roomed during different semesters with the
      Carmen-looking girl and the little Dresden-china blonde and
      a sloe-eyed freshman. She attended ball games and sang
      lustily with twenty-five thousand others: "There Is No
      Place Like Nebraska" and, carried away by mass emotion, at
      the moment would have cheerfully bared her breast for a
      sacrificial pound of flesh if Nebraska, in the guise of
      Shylock, had demanded it. She went in and out of the Alpha
      Beta house with all the intimacy of her own home, and when,
      between courses at the candle-lighted dinner table, the
      girls sang: "Alpha Beta, I Love You," and she saw the
      familiar faces of her sisters all about her, she would have
      thrown herself loyally on a burning pyre for Alpha Beta.
      But luckily, Alpha Beta required no such offerings to the
      gods. She wanted merely that one keep up to standard the
      honor of the house, which translated, meant scholarship,
      campus activities, appearance, and a high rate of dating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer between Laura's junior and senior years saw her
      leave for the East on the long-promised but
      never-before-materialized invitation of Uncle Harry. It saw
      Eloise in a state of excited interest in the coming close
      proximity of her daughter to the wealthy uncle and aunt. It
      saw John Deal plodding faithfully back and forth his
      office, the cares of the community upon his shoulders. It
      saw Kathie flitting about, coaxing a thrill from life; and
      curly-headed Patty, three years old now, in a constant
      state of waving farewells to her mother. It saw Jimmie
      attending strictly to his business in the bank, mothering
      Patty between times. It saw old Oscar Lutz tap-tapping on
      the sidewalks of Cedartown, carrying gifts of vegetables to
      those whom he bored, accompanying every cabbage and turnip
      and radish with a recollection of the old days. It saw old
      Christine Reinmueller trudging about the farmyard, picking
      up in her apron a few cobs that the men had dropped from
      the wagon, scolding at the wastefulness, or sitting in the
      shade counting over and over on her hard calloused fingers
      the eighties she had once owned, trying to remember where
      each had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer saw Allen farming his acres of rich black soil,
      directing his help, but with his own broad shoulder to the
      work, too. Allen was nearly through school now,--only
      another semester in which to finish a long and intensive
      course. He was dissatisfied with many things in his life,
      was searching constantly for the answer to his unrest. July
      saw his wheat harvest under way,--the high tide of the year
      for agriculturists. For those who love their Midwest it is
      a gladsome sight,--when the fields are half harvested, when
      half of the gold of the fields has turned to the bronze of
      the stubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old glamorous days of the harvest are over. The romance
      of the harvest season is practically a thing of the past.
      The rhythm of the scythe which once stirred poets is heard
      no more. One-man combines do the work of six men without
      the spectacular aid of the brawny bodies of harvest hands.
      Time was when the harvesting was a struggle of many days,
      the workers,--men, women, and horses,--exhausted when the
      grain was safely threshed and stored. Once a stream of
      harvest workmen migrated from the southern tip of the
      continent to the northern border, following the lead of the
      ripening grain,--a subject matter for novelists. Now the
      migration has dwindled to a small contingent drifting
      across the continent with hands on their gear-shifts. The
      rustic daughter who once carried the jug to the field,
      whose favor was the prize for which the hero and the
      villain threshed the wheat or husked the corn, is now
      usually home from college for the summer, doing anything
      but picking her dainty way through stubble to the men who
      run the combine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When half of Allen's wheat was in the shock, the rains
      descended for a day and a night. But Allen was also a corn
      and alfalfa farmer, and, as he said, what was "sauce for
      the goose was applesauce for the gander." It is this
      diversified farming as it is practiced to-day that has
      steadied weather conditions in the Midwest. In the days
      when the hot winds blew from an unbroken expanse of stubble
      fields and barren lands, serious damage was done. But under
      modern conditions the landscape is broken with such
      regularity by crops still unmatured, that serious damage
      from the winds is no longer likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wheat harvest was in, the third heavy alfalfa crop
      cut, and the corn tall and maturing in the fields, Allen
      went back to school for his last semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, returned from the East, was plunging into her senior
      year. Sociology, Browning, Magazine Article, Novel
      Study,--she looked over her schedule with happy
      anticipation for the amount of constructive work for which
      it called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, Allen was to date Delores Thaxter again this
      year. Laura saw them sometimes on the campus, standing and
      talking by Science Hall. Often Allen's long green roadster
      stood in front of the Gamma house where traffic continued
      to be thick, although Laura, herself, would not have
      admitted now that it was from causes of popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Allen saw Laura he was always cordial. At sight of
      her he would break into his cheerful grin and give her some
      kind of a high sign. Sometimes they stopped a few minutes
      by the Administration building to talk or ran into each
      other at the college book store.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's new back in the woods?" would be Allen's cheerful
      greeting, or "How's every one in the sticks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to gloat over the fact that he came from the
      country. "Now us farmers . . ." he would say with an
      exaggerated whining drawl, and go off into a monologue
      caricaturing his calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how serious was Allen's affair with Delores Thaxter
      Laura did not know. All University affairs appeared serious
      to an onlooker. Laura, herself, even now at the beginning
      of her senior year had no deep and desperate love affair as
      had the majority of her sorority sisters. She accepted
      dates to keep away from the opprobrium of being a crock,
      and thereby bringing utter disgrace upon a group which
      prided itself upon a one hundred per cent dating. But the
      dates were looked forward to with no passionate longing nor
      back upon with any degree of heartstab. Part of the time
      she was frankly relieved when they were over and she could
      slip into her own room and read or dream and scribble. That
      trip east to Uncle Harry's and Aunt Carolyn's had added
      further zest to her dreams of a future of accomplishment,
      had set her apart from the world around her more definitely
      than ever. She felt aloof, a little like a candidate for a
      sisterhood, a novice who would some day take the veil. She
      lived and moved and had her being with her family and
      friends, laughed, joked, conversed with them, but was not
      one of them. A story accepted by <i>The Prairie
      Schooner,</i> Nebraska's own literary magazine of highest
      type, was a thrilling reality. A poem in the same
      periodical, following later, added fuel to the little flame
      that burned so steadily within her very being.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed strange that one could so thoroughly play two
      parts, she told herself,--that a girl could take her place
      in the activities of college and sorority life, genuinely
      enjoying most of them, and remain the cloistered nun
      looking out through windows upon the panorama of the world.
      But it was true. That was her own dual personality. And the
      cloistered person was the real one,--the real Laura Deal,
      who, looking through the windows, saw always the wings of a
      white bird flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could now scarcely realize that this was the beginning
      of her senior year. Where had the time gone? It seemed such
      a little while ago that she had parted tearfully with her
      mother in the lower hall of The House. She said something
      of that now to Bernice Fowler. Bernice had dropped out
      after her sophomore year to teach, and as a consequence was
      to finish with Laura. She was in all campus
      activities,--was a Mortar Board, Big Sister,
      Y.W.,--everything was grist for her busy mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little blonde and the Carmen-looking girl, and a
      red-haired young person whose talk was usually as crisp and
      vivid as her flaming hair, were all in Laura's and
      Bernice's room lounging about in the various attitudes
      which one finds in the illustrations of "Daily Exercises."
      They formed a little inner circle in the sorority, a sort
      of unacknowledged and unnamed sorority within the sorority.
      They were all seniors, and four years of habitation under
      the same roof had rendered them immune to gratification
      over compliments from each other or humiliation over
      insults. The talk now was desultory. By no manner of excuse
      could one term it conversation. It fluttered about over a
      dozen scattering topics as a swallow dips from one place to
      another. Quite suddenly it lighted, with no apparent
      reason, on the odd ideas which people who do not live there
      have of the Midwest. Every one knew an anecdote which she
      brought out in turn and deposited with scorn on the scrap
      heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Midwest,--what does it mean to people who've never
      been here? They've the craziest notions. My cousin . . . a
      kid in his teens . . . was visiting in one of the New
      England states, and something was said about a story he'd
      read in the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i> The dumb-bell he
      was visiting said, 'Oh, do they have <i>Saturday Evening
      Posts</i> in Nebraska?' Can you <i>beat</i> it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prof. Newton told me, himself, he knew just two things
      about Nebraska when he came out to be on the faculty--the
      new Capitol and William Jennings Bryan," Laura said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman in Omaha, a musical critic and smarter than smart,
      told my mother she was in England and met an
      Englishman,--you know, girls, Englishmen inhabit
      England,--and when the introduction took place, the one who
      did the deed said, 'I want you to meet Miss So-and-So of
      Omaha, Nebraska.' Whereupon the Englishman toddles around
      and hunts up his wife and says, 'I want you to meet Miss
      So-and-So of Omaha, <i>Alaska</i>.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, and Bernice Fowler said, "Anybody can
      forgive an Englishman . . . I'll bet <i>you</i> think that
      Manchester is on the Isle of Man,--but what bums me up is
      Americans, themselves. A neighbor of ours in Nebraska City
      was some place East . . . I forget where . . . on the coast
      anyway, and some woman said to her, 'I expect the trees
      here look odd to you?' Shades of J. Sterling Morton who
      gave Arbor Day to the world!--I ask you, could you beat it?
      If there's any place on God's green earth where trees grow
      bigger or thicker than around Nebraska City! Our neighbor
      just naturally goes upstairs and gets a little two-by-four
      postcard that some one sent her from home, with a picture
      of the huge trees meeting overhead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've an aunt who has never come out here visiting because
      she thinks she'd have to lug along a tin bathtub."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do they get that way?" some one asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's writers," the Red-Head said. "They're to blame.
      Nobody writes anything about Nebraska as it is now. And of
      course, everybody thinks it's just like it used to be when
      the Indians jazzed around and played 'You're it' with
      arrows. Say 'Nebraska' to the average easterner who has
      never been here, and what does he think of? Pardon!--of
      what does he think? He sees a picture of Pa out picking up
      buffalo bones, while Ma's unpacking the barrel of old
      clothes and seed corn and dried apples somebody sent them,
      and Lizzie is standing at the door of the soddie shading
      her eyes with her hand to see if she can see a tree
      sprouting on the horizon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The impromptu club of critics rocked in glee, and the
      Red-Head went on: "It's the grasshopper literature that's
      done the dirty work. It just naturally sticks in people's
      minds. If writers would just lay off the darned
      grasshoppers for awhile. There hasn't been a flock of
      grasshoppers big enough to make an insect baseball team for
      over half a century, but people who've never been here
      still think we're out sweeping them off the sidewalks
      mornings, before we open up the wigwams."
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone laughed again, and the little blonde said, "The
      thing that scalds me is, there is no way of getting it
      across to them. Imagine all that stuff, and then think of
      the way things really are,--think of the thousands of
      beautiful homes . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . country ones, too . . . scads of them . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . and the schools and churches . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . and the people who own first editions and paintings
      and etchings . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . the finest collection of ivories in this country is
      right in Omaha . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . and the people that go abroad,--hundreds from Omaha
      and Lincoln . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . even <i>seven</i> this last summer from little old
      Cedartown," Laura put in, "and some people would think that
      was a whistle-stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      The languid Carmen-girl suddenly sat up: "I just remembered
      something . . . something awfully good. She was a newspaper
      woman . . . forget which one she was on here in the state .
      . . my Aunt knew her,--anyway she was a hotsy-totsy Midwest
      booster, and she went to New York to visit her relatives.
      They met her with an air of 'Now we'll thrill the poor
      little Main Street child.' She told afterward she had been
      ready to see everything there was and take solid pleasure
      in it, but it was their manner that got her, and she vowed
      to herself she wouldn't have a thrill to please them. I
      wish I could remember everything she told, but part runs
      like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was something head-lining the papers about General
      Pershing and she grew chesty about him being a Nebraskan.
      They took her to the Metropolitan Art Museum, and she said,
      'I see you have the works of our sculptor, Gutzon Borglum,
      in conspicuous places. He's a Nebraska boy, you know, and
      loves his state, comes back every time he can to meet old
      friends.' She goes past a book store and there are Willa
      Cather's books stacked up in a pyramid, and she gets snooty
      about her being a Nebraskan. They take her to see Mrs.
      Fiske in a Ballard play and she says: 'You knew this
      playwright was a Nebraskan, didn't you?' They go to see
      Harold Lloyd's new picture, and she says, 'Yes, Harold's a
      Nebraska boy that made good in the city.' I remember the
      story ended by them asking her what she especially wanted
      to see. And she says, as big as life, 'Coney Island. You
      know, a Nebraska boy designed it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the parting anecdote, for after a lusty laugh at the
      telling, Dresden-china uncurled her silken legs, yawned,
      and said that she had a heavy date with Chekhov, the
      Russian writer, and that she was quite ga-ga about him.
      Carmen followed suit with plaintive murmurs about mental
      testing. Red-Head lingered a moment, and said it broke her
      heart to leave, but there was a sociology paper, that if
      Papa Morgan didn't like her paper it was just too bad, and
      anyway she was going to write at the end:
      "Shoot-if-you-must-this-old-red-head,
      but-spare-my-sanity-she-said."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all yawned and stretched themselves across the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura closed the door after the retreating army of
      invasion, and turning to her own work, stood trying to
      decide whether to tackle her term paper on "Criticism In
      America," make out a list of English idioms, or write a
      poem to Bernice Fowler who was taking up swimming, and
      entitle it "Ode to a Water Fowler." The last seemed the
      most attractive of the three, and she was just beginning:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Whither, midst falling spray,<br>
      While flounder the pledges with the last fatal plunge,<br>
      Far, through the murky depths, dost thou careen<br>
      In thy solitary lunge?
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      when a freshman inserted snappy black-button eyes between
      the door and the casing, and said in pert sing-song: "Mr.
      Allen Rinemiller in the north living room . . . calling for
      Miss Laura Deal . . . and if Miss Laura Deal doesn't want
      to talk to him . . . here's a lady who will . . . ah . . .
      men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Laura Deal raised curving eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you say 'lady'?" she asked acridly, and the pert
      freshman withdrew in some haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went down the long stairs that turned in three
      directions, a slim hand slipping along the mahogany
      banister. Allen, who had been standing by one of the French
      windows with his back to the stairway, turned and watched
      her unflurried descent. Laura's sleek brown head rose from
      her shoulders with perfect grace, her dark eyes were
      lovely, and the browns and tans and a bit of orange which
      she wore with taste, seemed melting into the clear olive of
      her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cute kid," he thought, ". . . different, too." Just what
      he meant by "different," he himself could not have told.
      For the brief space of a moment, it flashed through his
      mind that he could not have asked any of the other
      University girls he had dated to do this thing he was
      asking of Laura Deal--least of all, Miss Delores Thaxter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Allen, welcome to our happy home." Laura was cool,
      unperturbed. She had that detached air of looking on at
      life. But she was no longer diffident. Her conversation no
      longer choked her; she had perfect poise, plenty of small
      talk. There was no situation which she could not handle
      without embarrassment. Some would have said the sorority
      had done it for her, some, the University, others,--just
      life, itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura rather admired Allen, but he was a mere character in
      a story. She liked his humor, his looks, his big physique,
      well-knit and compact, his blond head with the three
      distinct waves in his hair, the way his blue eyes crinkled
      and his mouth drew up when he grinned. Sometimes she had
      even pictured him in various settings of the current story
      in her mind, trying out different girls as the strange
      fictional characters,--never Delores Thaxter or any of the
      real girls he had dated. She liked thinking out these
      plots. Sometimes, when she was deeply interested in the
      outcome of her own fanciful creations, she would purposely
      wait until the girls had all gone to their eight o'clocks,
      so she could walk alone and finish the story in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Busy?" Allen wanted to know now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing more pressing than the term paper on
      "American Criticism," the outline of English idioms, and
      the unfinished but scarcely important parody, Laura said
      she was not busy,--not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I wish you'd do something for me, Laura." Allen's
      clean-cut face was serious, his cheerful grin gone. "And
      not so hot either. Would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, Allen--if I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They took Grandma over to the State Hospital yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Allen! The State Hospital. She's not . . . ?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes . . . gone nuts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm sorry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's not very bad. Most of the time she's O.K., but right
      in the midst of being perfectly normal, some one will say
      something,--innocently enough,--that will set her off, and
      then she's just . . ." he threw out his hand, "not there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clear out of her mind, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--and the folks think I ought to go out and see her.
      She calls for different ones of us when she's all right.
      Told Uncle Emil she wished I'd come and see her. Rather be
      shot than go, but it's got to be done, and I thought as
      long as you were one of the few here in school who knew
      her, maybe you wouldn't mind going along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no, Allen,--I'll be awfully glad to go with you if
      you want me." And she was up the stairs again on third to
      get a chic little brown hat and a fur. Red-Head,
      Dresden-China and Carmen all met her in the upper hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lolly Deal, however did you work it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Headlines for the <i>Daily Nebraskan</i>: 'Alpha Beta Gets
      Big Burly Football Man Away From Gamma.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sly little vamp . . . good work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You silly things," Laura was coolness itself. "I'm going
      out with him to see his Grandmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      At which perfectly true statement, the trio howled with
      laughter, and called after her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out for the wolf, Lolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What big teeth you have, Grandmother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The better to eat you, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura turned at the top of the stairs, said succinctly, "Go
      sit on three tacks," and went down to Allen.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      From the sorority house they drove in Allen's long green
      roadster through the shaded streets of Lincoln, where elms
      and poplars bordered the close-cropped lawns, past lovely
      homes set in emerald frames of shrubbery untouched yet by
      frost, until they came to the group of buildings which make
      up the little city of unfortunates. Up the long curving
      drive they swung and parked the roadster near a graveled
      path. They went first into the office, but were there
      directed back to the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found her under the trees with one of the nurses in
      uniform. Under the trees sat old Christine Reinmueller,
      this little German peasant woman of the old school, with
      her shapeless body, her seamed red face, and her faded hair
      braided in its thin flat braids like a colorless little rug
      pinned to the back of her head. Idly under the trees sat
      old Christine Reinmueller, her gnarled red hands with their
      broken and blackened nails, lying in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know me, Grandma?" Allen bent low over the shrunken
      little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with dim blue eyes, blurred and
      watering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're . . . one of 'em," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes . . . I'm Allen . . . your grandson . . . Herman's and
      Lucy's son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ya . . . I know." She was listless, inattentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is Laura, Grandma." Allen drew the girl forward.
      "Do you know her . . . Laura Deal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old eyes turned to Laura for the first time, squinted,
      peered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deal . . . Deal." She brightened. "Ya . . . you I know,
      too." She put up her hard old hands and drew Laura's soft
      white one into them. "So? For so long . . . I not see you .
      . . huh? For so long a time, you not come by me. And so
      many tings togedder ve do. Ya . . . I know . . ." She
      nodded wisely. "Of me you take care ven my babies are born.
      Of you I take care ven your babies are born . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I say, Grandma . . ." Allen reddened a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Laura knew. "Never mind, Allen. She thinks I'm my
      grandmother. She thinks I'm Abbie Deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ya . . . dats it . . . Abbie . . . I remember hard now.
      Abbie! My frien' . . . my frien' for all my life. Ya." She
      stroked Laura's pink palm with her own calloused ones, and
      uttered little soft purring sounds. Once she put the hand
      up to her cheek with caressing motion. "Oh . . . so? You
      remember. Togedder ve come . . . by de Veeping Vater . . .
      togedder ve build de houses close by . . . I remember. De
      long grass wave . . . de sun shine . . . all vas
      <i>freundshaft</i> . . . friendship. Togedder all vas
      <i>freunde</i> . . . frien's. How you not come see me . . .
      my Abbie frien'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura's ready emotions were stirred unaccountably. She was
      winking back the tears. How dramatic! How story-like! "I'll
      come now . . . often. I'll drive out again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bring her. Grandma." Allen promised solemnly. He was
      a little embarrassed, anxious to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ya! Bring her . . . you!" She was evidently not fully
      conscious of her relationship to Allen. "Of old times
      togedder ve talk . . . togedder ve remember . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Grandma." Allen's fine blond head bent low, "we've
      heard you tell all about those old times. You had a pretty
      tough time, didn't you . . . getting all your land in shape
      . . . ?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A change came over Christine. An evil expression slipped
      over her leathery wrinkled face. It grew malicious,
      cunning. "De land . . ." she said, "So? It's you knows
      about my land . . . all my eighties . . . eleven eighties I
      have . . . So? My land you take . . . ?" She was rising,
      menacingly, stepping toward them with threatening gestures.
      Involuntarily, Laura slipped back against Allen and his
      arms went tightly around her. Together they stood for a few
      moments, uncertain what to do. Then the nurse shook her
      head at them and nodded toward the parked car. Allen's arms
      slackened. Laura slipped out of them and together they
      walked over to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove away silently, the shadow of the interview over
      them. Laura was distinctly disturbed. Part of that
      emotional disturbance seemed to come from the things the
      old German lady had said, but a little of it was from that
      queer moment when she had involuntarily slipped into
      Allen's arms. She did not go in for that sort of thing--had
      no taste for it--the girls at The House laughed at her for
      being old-fashioned, but she quite distinctly knew her own
      mind. She wished now that she had kept her head a little
      better. There had been no real danger from old Christine.
      It looked a little as though she had chosen to make the
      most of a simple situation. In reality, it had been done
      almost without her volition. And with Allen Rinemiller, of
      all people! It was foolish, of course, to exaggerate the
      small incident, so she ignored the memory of it and opened
      the conversation with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old lady. Just think, Allen. Doesn't it sort of get
      you . . . to think about their coming here over sixty years
      ago? My grandmother used to tell me about it. Your
      grandparents and mine and old Oscar Lutz and his wife, and
      my cousin Katherine's grandparents, Henry and Sarah Lutz,
      all met at the Weeping Water and came on into our community
      the same day. Grandma used to say there wasn't a thing to
      be seen but the blue sky, the prairie grass in every
      direction on the low rolling hills, and a few trees along
      the creek bed. The sun was going down, the four wagons made
      a circle and they built a campfire in the center. The
      Indians camped near them, and frightened them silly. Can
      you feature it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord--imagine it--the very same spot where our farm lies,
      and the graveled roads and Cedartown. I never thought much
      about it, but hearing you tell about it, makes it pretty
      clear. Feature the comparison--with cars going by now on
      the hard packed roads and aircraft sailing over the farm .
      . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And voices from both coasts coming into the homes, and
      being able to talk to any one by long distance . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a combine doing a hundred acres a day . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were approaching the turn now which would take them
      back to the University. "How about driving out farther? Too
      busy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      American Criticism and English idioms seemed suddenly very
      unimportant phases of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said Laura, "I'd love it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove until there was just time to get back to the Pi
      Tau and Alpha Beta houses for dinner. In the meantime, they
      had discussed fraternities, sororities, friendships,
      athletics, professors, sunsets, careers, columnists, plays,
      moving pictures, life, love, and the best way to get rid of
      sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had driven up in front of the Alpha Beta house,
      and Allen had gone with Laura to the door, he said rather
      seriously: "I'll be seeing you again, Laura, if I may."
      They could see the girls passing into the dining room.
      There would be no time to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why yes, Allen," Laura laughed up at him, "we'll have to
      have another talkfest and settle all the questions Congress
      can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the table, she came in for a sly bombardment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you find Grandmother, Lolly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They called it softly across the candles and low bowls of
      flowers, in the gentle well-bred tones required of Alpha
      Beta ladies at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you lift up the latch and walk in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any nice young woodsman rescue you, Lolly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed at their nonsense. She felt gay,
      light-hearted, buoyant. A very nice thing had
      happened,--she had made a new friend. In one hundred and
      twenty minutes ticked off by her jeweled watch, a strange
      thing had happened. There flashed through her mind all
      those past years of inhibitions,--that period in which she
      had been groping for some one to whom she could talk
      intimately. There had never been any one but Grandmother
      Deal to whom she could turn her mind inside out. Even as
      the girls thrust verbal pins into her with smooth suave
      voices, she was thinking of her father's taciturnity,--her
      mother's lack of understanding,--of cousin Katherine,--of
      Aunt Grace,--of her teachers,--the girls here and those at
      home,--there had never been any one of them to whom she
      could tell her innermost thoughts without confusion. Not
      until now. And just to-day something had happened. This
      afternoon a very lovely thing had taken place. She had
      found she could talk about anything to Allen Rinemiller.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went home over the week-end. But this time she rode
      in Allen Rinemiller's long green roadster. Allen was
      trying, as he said, "to keep one eye on the farm, one on
      the football field and one on the last of his studies." The
      ride over the hard packed graveled highway was a pleasant
      one. October in the Midwest presents some days that are
      flawless. Blue skies, splashes of gold and scarlet along
      the river's banks, fields of winter wheat as faintly green
      as fairy carpets, huge oblong patches of newly plowed
      earth, and whispering cornfields ripe for the husking.
    </p>
    <p>
      To top one of eastern Nebraska's low rolling hills in
      October and see the entire hollow bowl of the world fitting
      the entire hollow bowl of the skies is to glimpse a bit of
      Infinity. Often there is a haze in the atmosphere, faint,
      ethereal, clinging in the hollows of the far hills as
      though smoke from Indian campfires of long-gone Octobers
      lingered in the valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen and Laura, riding home in the green roadster, spoke
      of it often--the beauty of the day. They were both quite
      touched with gratitude at the generosity which Nature was
      displaying for their benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home seemed restful and quiet to Laura after the noise and
      confusion at The House, which usually resembled a
      martin-house with girls' heads protruding from all the
      doors in lieu of swallows. But to her disappointment she
      had to give her Saturday afternoon over to attending a
      funeral service; Kathie's Grandmother Lutz was brought from
      Kansas City to be buried in the old home cemetery. She had
      been a dressy old lady, smart and bright-eyed up to her
      last illness. Looking at her in death, Laura could think of
      nothing so much as a little waxen doll with curly
      snow-white hair, pink cheeks, and dainty waxen hands across
      a satin dress, sunk down in the elegance of a white satin
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My, my, how my brother Henry loved that girl, with her
      snappy black eyes and her pink cheeks and her merry ways,"
      Old Oscar was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave Laura a moment of shocked surprise,--to think that
      the eighty-six-year-old waxen doll had once been a young
      girl. And evidently Oscar Lutz still thought of her as
      youthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early evening Laura had strolled over to his yard
      when she saw him covering his roses with leaves and tying
      gunny-sacks about them. Old Oscar was getting ready for his
      yearly California trip, which meant not so much getting
      himself ready as his house and garden. He had sat down on
      the edge of the porch when he saw her coming. "And now
      Sarah's gone . . ." he was saying, "and Old Christine
      babbles about her land and I guess folks think I'm not much
      better. My, we was a lively, husky crowd,--Marthy and me,
      Henry and Sarah, Will and Abbie Deal, Gus and Christine
      Reinmueller . . . Well, I'll go soon, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he, thought Laura, how <i>could</i> he speak so
      cheerfully of it, as though it were a casual trip into the
      next county. "One of these days I'll catch up with 'em all
      . . . my old crowd . . . I've lived way beyond my allotted
      time now. Don't fear it a mite, not a mite. Only fear I
      have is that it'll be a long-drawn-out sickness, slow like
      a tree rottin' down . . . crumblin' to pieces by inches . .
      . sufferin' all the time and puttin' somebody to a lot of
      trouble. No, I want to go quick like a sturdy tree crashin'
      in the wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think about it, Uncle Oscar. Everybody would see
      that you had a good nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't want a nurse," he snapped. "Couldn't afford one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura wished that he did not have that trait of stinginess.
      Every one knew he had money, plenty of it. Every week or so
      he went into the bank and took his tin box back into her
      father's office and looked over his bonds and mortgages.
      Laura liked the old man, but she wished he did not have
      that unlikable characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer--ain't afraid to die. But hate to leave, too. Hate
      to hand over the community to the new generation for 'em to
      run it. Always seems as though the country around here just
      belonged to us old ones that got here first. 'Spose
      Columbus and Balboa and the rest of 'em had that same
      feeling of ownership." He laughed at himself deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never heard him put it in so many words before, but
      she had always sensed it in him,--a sort of brooding over
      the community as though he were personally responsible for
      its sins and virtues, its shortcomings and its good points.
      It was his state, his land, his people. Laura, listening,
      and only half attention, thinking that it was almost time
      for Allen Rienmiller to drive up, wondered idly if people
      understood the old man,--realized that what they chose to
      look upon as meddling was in reality not that at all.
      Thumping along the graveled highways, tap-tapping on the
      cement sidewalks he went his way, advising, discussing,
      recalling, watching, planning. "Old Mind-As-How" they
      called him. She decided people didn't understand him. It
      was not that he wanted to meddle. He had merely never lost
      his sense of ownership. It was not that he wanted to bore.
      He had merely wanted them not to forget. His state, his
      land, his people!
    </p>
    <p>
      His cracked old voice went on its musing way: "Sarah was
      buried there to-day in the very land Henry gave for the
      cemetery. Sarah's little orphaned nephew died . . . she'd
      brought him out on the long journey from Michigan. He was
      down by the creek bed one day and got snake bit. Doctor
      worked with him all night, but it killed him. He was the
      first one to be buried there. I made him a pine coffin and
      Abbie Deal and Christine Reinmueller lined it with one of
      Sarah's quilts. Marthy helped Sarah wash and dress him.
      Henry picked out a knoll on his land, and him and I dug a
      little grave up there . . . the sun was hot and the wind
      was blowing the dry grass . . . and there wasn't a sign of
      shade tree nearer than Stove Creek. That was the beginning
      of the cemetery. My father was buried next, and then a
      newborn baby of your Grandmother Deal's. We put a little
      wooden fence around them three graves so the cattle
      wouldn't step on 'em nor the coyotes bother 'em. The
      tumble-weeds would come rollin' across the prairie and
      bunch up like dried brown snowdrifts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura thought of "Hillside" as she had seen it that
      day,--the lovely well-kept city of the dead with its
      hundreds of markers, its graveled paths and its huge shade
      trees, and could scarcely believe that old Oscar had seen
      the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know what'll come of us,--whether we'll just lay
      there a long time . . ." Laura heard him going on as one
      hears the wind in the trees,--an old man talking only of
      death to a young girl who was thinking only of life. ". . .
      Don't see much difference, however it is. The bodies anyway
      go back to the good old soil. Leaves and flowers, animals
      and people . . . under my eyes I've seen 'em all turn to
      the composition of the earth itself. In time the elements
      run up through the trees and grasses and come to life
      again. If I thought I'd just help along that way, it don't
      seem so bad. I like to think that I'll always be a part of
      the prairie round about here somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Uncle Oscar,--you're full of poetry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me? Snappin' crocodiles! Ain't never read any poetry in my
      life but 'One Hoss Shay' and 'Barefoot Boy' and a few like
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let me say one to you then and see if it isn't just
      about what you've been saying." And Laura, who always had
      poetry at her tongue's end, told him the verses about:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Never gravedigger shall shovel me under,<br>
      I shall arise with the loam's mellow thunder<br>
      To drift in the gray of the moor-mist yonder.<br>
      "Never in grave's maw I'll be lying,<br>
      With the wild geese in heaven flying<br>
      And the sea birds over the white wake crying."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty . . . awful pretty . . ." He mumbled it over
      several times, as though he were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen drove up to the curb at her home and Laura slipped
      away. For a long time the old man sat there on the porch,
      through his mind running the pleasant thought of the mist
      on the prairies and the sound of the wild geese honking.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar was distinctly interested in the fact that he had
      seen young Rinemiller drive up for Laura. On Sunday morning
      he tap-tapped over to the Deals' and took walnuts in the
      old pail with a rope for a handle. When Laura emptied them,
      he said slyly: "You wouldn't want never to marry Allen
      Rinemiller, Laura."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was amused at the old man's meddling. "No, I know I
      wouldn't," she agreed amiably and added: "But why wouldn't
      I?" so that old Oscar smiled behind the wind-break of his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice boy . . ." he mused, "but now take Gus . . . his
      grandfather. Tightest-fisted Dutchman you ever see. Was so
      tight, that when he built their new house back in the old
      days, he picked up all the little pieces of stone no bigger
      than these walnuts and saved 'em for another foundation . .
      . so tight, he used to pick the seeds out of the ground
      when they didn't sprout . . . tighter than the bark on a
      tree . . . and Christine worse than him . . . used to put
      her flatiron down in the coals so she wouldn't have to use
      much fire for ironing . . . used to sit up close to the
      stove so she wouldn't have to light lamps . . . not just
      savin' . . . plain skinflints for stinginess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But those were his grandparents," Laura said, "and Allen's
      no more like that than anything. He's the third generation,
      Uncle Oscar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't want to marry Laura Deal," old Oscar said
      confidentially that afternoon, when he cornered Allen at
      the curb in front of the Deal home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who said I wouldn't?" Allen asked, so that the old man
      smiled behind the duck-blind of his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice girl . . ." he mused, "but sort of thin and slimsy
      and delicate, not robust and hearty like the kind of girl
      you ought to have on a farm. Pick out a good stout one when
      the time comes--one with big bone and muscle, and you'll
      have a partner instead of a plaything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen laughed good-naturedly at the old man's meddling.
      "When the time comes, it'll be a wife I'll want, not a
      hired man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old man Lutz tap-tapped back home. "Well," he said
      cheerfully to himself as he packed his battered old bag for
      the California trip, "I don't know much poetry, but I mind
      as how there's a verse that says:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "He was warned agin' the woman,<br>
      She was warned agin' the man;<br>
      And if that won't make a weddin'<br>
      Why, there's nothin' else that can."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Laura thought it was very kind of Allen to take her back to
      school Monday morning in the green roadster,--neighborly
      and friendly. Allen thought it very kind of Laura to go
      back with him,--neighborly and friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night, with the sorority house locked and barred,
      and lights in the big brick structure snapping out one by
      one, Laura, in yellow pajamas, brushing her soft brown
      hair, heard the Carmen girl across the hall say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hot news, girls,--they say over at the Gamma House that
      Allen Rinemiller is about to hang his frat pin on the
      dashing dapper devoted Delores."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura paused with the brush in her hand and frankly
      listened. It was not so surprising, but even so, it
      startled her a bit. She could see the three girls through
      the open door lounging about on the couch beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard it, too." It was Dresden-china. "She'll be the
      next to pass the candy over there. And if you ask
      <i>me,</i> they're beating us with announcements. We'll
      have to pep up a bit. Carmen, can't you do something for
      God, home and country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brush in hand, Laura walked into the room with: "All I can
      say is that Thaxter person will make a hot farmer's wife.
      I'll bet she doesn't know any more about farm life than a
      kid from the sidewalks of New York. She probably thinks you
      plant winter wheat in winter and that a silo is a new kind
      of vegetable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do <i>you</i> care, Lolly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> don't care. But I hate to see Allen taken in.
      Don't forget he comes from my home town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, we forgot, Lolly. 'Our families are friends.
      His grandmother knew my grandmother. His grandfather knew
      my grandfather. His Uncle knew my Uncle. His Aunt knew
      my--'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, choke her with the curtain tie-backs." Laura would not
      laugh. "The Rinemillers have lots of land and Allen has big
      things ahead of him. He's up on the very latest things in
      scientific farming . . . he gave a talk on some of the new
      methods to our Commercial Club at home . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to the little press agent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not sour grapes about Delores?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Acid raisins, Lolly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Red-Head chanted:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Lolly's mad and I'm glad, and I know what'll vex her,<br>
      When the big green car has gone afar<br>
      And Allen no longer necks her."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They all howled. Laura said in her most courteous tones, "I
      hope your children all have hangnails." Then she went into
      her own room and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen took Delores Thaxter to the Military ball for which
      he had already dated her. But to the amazement of Alpha
      Betas and Pi Taus at large, he took Laura to his own
      fraternity formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about it, Lolly?" The girls teased her. "Off again, on
      again, gone again . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who gets the nice big football man for a prize--Gamma Zeta
      or Alpha Beta?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Red-Head stood on one foot, bent her body forward
      and shading her eyes with her hand, recited dramatically:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girls came around the bend with chariot wheels almost
      touching. Black horses and white were neck and neck. Eyes
      glued to the front, they urged on their sweating steeds.
      Laura Ben Hur was a little in the lead of Delores Messala .
      . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, herself, had to laugh at that bit of foolishness,
      but she retorted: "You girls give me a pain in the neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which they returned an immediate musical answer in
      soprano, contralto and tenor form:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "We give her a pain in the neck<br>
      We give her a pain in the neck<br>
      We're awful sad to make her mad<br>
      But we give her a pain in the neck."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "And what's more," Laura spoke after the last musical chord
      had died away: "Delores can have him when it comes to
      marrying. I wouldn't marry him if he were the last man in
      the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't <i>have</i> to marry him, then, Lolly," the
      Carmen-girl drawled languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Pi Tau formal, Allen very frankly went only with
      Laura. No Alpha Beta knew just what happened, but quite
      suddenly, Delores Thaxter was importing a medic from
      Creighton University, and Allen Rinemiller was ringing the
      Alpha Beta door bell one hundred per cent of the evenings
      in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was upset beyond measure. She talked about it most
      of her waking hours: "Imagine sending her up there with
      several thousand young men running around loose on the
      campus,--some of them from Lincoln's and Omaha's best
      families. She doesn't pay much attention to <i>those,</i>
      of course,--and then, out of the whole University, starts
      going with a <i>Rinemiller."</i> In Eloise's cold nasal
      tones it sounded as though it were "Rhinoceros."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't think of a nicer chap," John retorted. "Clean,
      decent, smart, good mixer, well-fixed. What more do you
      want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise snorted. "Every time I look at him I see old Gus
      driving to town on a load of hogs and Christine in her blue
      calico dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every time <i>I</i> look at him I see a good old product
      of the Midwest's melting-pot--German and American. He has
      the thrifty ambitious traits of the grandparents--his
      father's honesty and decency, his nice mother's refinement.
      Good kid, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eloise's mouth was straight and fixed in grim
      determination. All her life she had managed the family and
      not yet was she ready to yield the scepter. That night she
      wrote a long explanatory letter to Uncle Harry Wentworth.
      And she mailed it herself.

      Allen finished in the mid-year and left for home to begin
      the real business of farming. He had a dozen changes he
      wanted to make, plans which would increase his business
      materially, he believed. And business it was to Allen. He
      turned the southeast room into an office, installed a desk,
      two filing cases and a typewriter. He was keeping a full
      tabulation of figures on production and cost and profits.
      If the wraith of old Gus could have hovered over the scene,
      it would have been heard to say: "For what you expect to
      use them furnitures and books . . . to plow it and harrow?
      Mein Gott!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Allen had many plans, the one Plan which
      preceded all others was now definitely formed. It was
      spring and Allen was young, and Springtime and Youth are a
      call to the rainbow's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was home in April,--home to discuss with her father
      and mother which of two positions she would take. Pretty
      lucky, she told herself, to have two from which to choose.
      Some of the girls had heard nothing yet from their
      applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      April in Nebraska is a moody creature, soft and hard,
      gentle and ferocious, as capricious as a girl. Saturday was
      cloudy, with warm languorous sprinkles of rain smelling of
      moist loam and plum blossoms. There was an odor, too, of
      bonfires smoldering on through sudden gentle showers.
      Laura, in a snug-fitting raincoat, full of the joy of
      living, did errands for her mother in the morning. When she
      came out of Kathie's on the way home, Verna Conden stopped
      the sweeping of the front walk, and with that same air of
      embarrassment Laura had noted before, said: "I guess you
      must have been laughing in your sleeve at me . . . that day
      I asked you about . . . Allen." Her voice was tense, a
      little bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no, I didn't, Verna." Laura's brown eyes looked
      frankly into the girl's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verna laughed shortly: "Well, it doesn't matter, now," and
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went on, but she was disturbed, the spring morning a
      little spoiled. Verna had referred to Allen's and her
      friendship, of course. It bothered her all the way home,
      like a gnat that sung about her head and irritated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home again, she found two things had happened in the
      short space of time she had been gone. Old Oscar Lutz had
      arrived from California. And her mother had received a
      letter from Uncle Harry Wentworth. Eloise seemed nervously
      elated. She wanted Laura to get out of her things at once
      and find an easy-chair in which to sit while she read. The
      letter was important, so important that Laura's whole life
      would be changed by it, her mother told her. Laura slipped
      out of her wet coat, took the letter over by the east
      windows, and read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was right. Eloise would have said she was always
      right. So different was it to be after the arrival of the
      letter, that on Sunday afternoon when Allen said, "What
      about the decision between the two positions?" Laura was
      ready to say: "I'm not taking either, Allen. I'm going to
      my Uncle Harry Wentworth's in New York and stay,--well,
      until Christmas, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taking Laura back to the University, driving on a
      side dirt road rather than the graveled highway. The road
      dipped down little hills, trudged up steeper ones, turned a
      bit across small bridges set cornerwise to cut across a
      vagrant brook. There were wild plum blossoms along the
      right of way. The box-elders were pale April green, the
      maples dark April green, the winter wheat vivid April
      green. Fields were mellow for the planting; pastures lush
      for the feeding. Pert robins darted across the highway,
      flying low and saucily in front of the car. At farmhouses,
      purple martins were doing nose-dives and other spectacular
      aeronautics. A little brown pheasant then stepped daintily
      out of the grass and with slow unflurried movements stepped
      daintily back again. The air was sweet with the odor of
      fresh spring winds from over the prairies. Blowing into
      their young nostrils, it might have been like the breath of
      life when man became a living soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at the top of the highest of the hills between
      their home and Lincoln. They could see in every direction
      to the horizon line, which became for them a circle
      complete in its visible circumference. It seemed to them
      half the world and they the center of the hemisphere. Allen
      stopped the car at the side of the grassy road on the hill
      top. They were alone in the center of the world,--their
      world. And Laura was tumbling a little of that world about
      Allen's ears now by saying some strange words:
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . go to my Uncle Harry Wentworth's in New York . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Until Christmas?" He said the words as though Christmas
      were some date in a future century.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll be home by Christmas; and after that, I can
      tell you about other plans. But, of course, the biggest one
      of all is to write."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other plans? Going to marry?" he asked teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, heavens, no. I'm never going to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I've known that ever since I was twelve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's bad news. I thought . . . Laura . . . maybe you'd
      marry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura raised frank brown eyes to Allen and then dropped
      them immediately. It is not given to femininity to look
      unabashed into the muzzle of The Great Question, however
      flippantly or awkwardly that question may have been asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? Ah, Allen . . . that's nice of you . . . and
      everything, if you mean it . . ." For a sudden fleeting
      moment, she was human enough to think of the pleasure of
      telling the girls at The House.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I mean it. Gee, Laura . . . I don't know . . .
      ever since that first day you went with me out to see
      Grandma . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I . . . wasn't counting on that . . . Allen. We've
      been such good friends this year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something greater than friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, Allen. But I couldn't . . . not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen was trying to save his self-respect, sustain a
      balance between the expression of romance and his usual
      cheerful banter. So he said lightly, "You could do worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes . . . but if I didn't, I could do <i>verse,"</i> Laura
      countered. And they both laughed. Youth is youth, laughter
      comes easily, and the great American Youth dearly loves his
      own wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wasn't such a good wise-crack,--but it's true. Allen,
      I'm going in for a career in good earnest. There's
      something in my life that I want to confide in you about .
      . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the duke's daughter, kidnaped by the Deal family,"
      Allen guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can make light of it if it pleases you, Allen; but
      it's really an awfully serious thing to me. Do you remember
      a day, ages ago, when I was a kid, and you brought wood to
      Kathie's and you saw for the first time that painting of my
      grandmother's grandmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I mind as how,' as old man Lutz would say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was my great-great-grandmother," Laura went on.
      "Imagine it! Her name was Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, and
      she was one grand aristocrat. My own Grandmother Deal used
      to tell me how she always thought of this lovely lady, and
      when she was young, how the thought of her was kind of an
      inspiration to want to do something great,--sing or paint
      or write,--some genuinely creative thing. Well, Grandmother
      Deal never did,--not any of the things she planned to do
      when she was young. You know how she just married and came
      West and raised and cared for her family, and died an old
      woman without doing any of those things that had so
      inspired her when she was young."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was a fine old lady," Allen said stoutly, as though he
      were shielding her from criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't I know she was, and her life in its way was full and
      wonderful. I think at the last she wouldn't have had it any
      different. But just the same, when she told me all
      that,--her cherished hopes that never were fulfilled, I
      could sense that she felt she had missed something,--and
      she said to me: 'Laura, you'll have a fine education and
      you'll do some of the things I never did.' Well, I'm going
      to, Allen . . . I'm going to do some of the things she
      never did. Now, this is the mysterious thing I was going to
      tell you . . . that very day you brought the wood, standing
      there in front of the lovely lady who was an inspiration
      for my grandmother when she was little, I said that I'd
      have that career which Grandmother missed,--first of all,
      selfishly . . . I guess we're all more or less
      self-centered . . . but secondly, for my grandmother's
      sake. She had so much faith in me doing what she always
      wanted to do and never did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go down and talk to the painted dame myself . . .
      tell her king's excuse, you've changed your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't make light of it, Allen; I'm serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that doesn't keep you from marrying." He too, was
      serious again--serious and earnest. "Marriage doesn't keep
      women from careers now, any more than screens keep out the
      breeze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were modern and up-to-date. As a matter of
      fact, you're as old-fashioned as the dickens. There's
      nothing to keep you from going on with your writing, if
      you'd marry me. Look at the people who keep on with their
      chosen work outside their homes. And you wouldn't even have
      to leave your home to do your kind of work. Look at your
      own Aunt Isabelle Rhodes in Chicago. Hasn't she been a
      professional singer and music teacher ever since she and
      Harrison Rhodes were married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but they're different. They work together. He
      composes and she sings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, so could we. You'd write, and I'd sharpen your
      pencils." Modern youth may be as romantic as the swain of
      other generations, but he bestows the sweets rolled up in
      acrid flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Allen. It just doesn't work,--marriage and a career.
      I'll modify that statement and say, it may work for some
      women but it wouldn't for me. I would want to do one or the
      other well and thoroughly." She named two famous unmarried
      authors. "They're my ideals, and I'd like to follow as
      nearly as I could in their footsteps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll raise your bid. Three clubs." Allen retorted, and
      named three equally famous ones who had married and raised
      families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura chose to ignore the scored point with: "And you'll
      always live here, Allen, of course, and I couldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was genuinely amazed at that and at Laura's stating
      flatly: "Not here, Allen, I couldn't do anything worth
      while here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer it yourself. What is there to write about here? No
      material here and no attractive atmosphere, and atmosphere
      is what counts. Look at all successful literature--in it
      the atmosphere of old New England, the atmosphere of London
      nights, of romantic New Orleans, of California's Spanish
      missions and the gold rush, of New York's Ghetto and
      Broadway and old Hudson river romances, of queer
      hill-billies, of Alaskan settings. The first writers who
      used the midwest pioneer material got all the
      pickings--just all there was. I ask you again, What is
      there left to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen looked around rather helplessly. The late afternoon
      sunshine of the mellow April day touched the tips of the
      low rolling hills and lay in shallow lakes of light on the
      fields and meadows. It looked very beautiful to Allen. He
      felt young, alive, strong, virile--one with the maples in
      which the sap had long been running, with the newly opened
      cottonwood buds that had burst into green life, with the
      fallow fields calling for the seeding, with the mating
      songs of robins, with swallows on the nuptial flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can't tell," he said helplessly. "But those things
      are easy for you. I should think you'd know. It looks . .
      ." he waved his hand around at the landscape, "mighty good
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scenery," Laura said, "just setting. And there's no story
      in a setting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the people," Allen was stanch in his groping.
      "Where'll you find more substantial people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not arguing about their characters, but just
      'substantial people' don't mean a thing in the literary
      world. In fact, 'substantial people' are about the poorest
      material one could find . . . there's no dramatic interest
      in them, whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean they don't kill their offspring or run away
      with other men's wives, I'm glad I don't live in a dramatic
      community."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you don't get the point at all, Allen. This is my home
      as much as yours. Don't I love it too, every bit as much as
      you do? I intend always to come back to it. But my life
      work calls--see? If you were an explorer, for instance, you
      couldn't stay in Cedartown to explore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too deep . . . can't follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professor Throckmortin says it's because there's no
      spiritual uplift here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spiritual fiddlesticks. Throckmortin has indigestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says there's no great beauty here,--that without
      mountains and seas, the monotony of the landscape brings
      out in Midwesterners a pessimism of the spirit and a
      depression of the soul,--and that it's reflected in our
      writings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord. Does he say that? I'll stack the Midwest up any
      time by the side of any other part of the country he'll
      bring on. Think of the ten thousand lakes of Minnesota with
      their birch trees. . . . Tell him to go out and see the
      colored Bad Lands of Dakota as I did last year, and look at
      the Grand Canyon's rival. Take a look at the blue skies
      over the sandhills of northern Nebraska when a crane flies
      across it . . . Look at this right here . . . Gosh, I call
      that a sight for sore eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't get all hot and bothered, Allen. I like it,
      too." Laura turned to take in the circle of the landscape
      as it lay under the lights and shadows of the spring
      afternoon--the whole picture of rolling hills and dipping
      valleys, a lovely thing of greens and tans and blues, as
      dainty as a Corot, but painted on a canvas the size of a
      half world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love my home as much as any one, but you'll just have to
      admit it's the common or garden-variety spot of the map for
      atmosphere, speaking in a literary sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not speaking in a literary sense; but I'll be darned
      if I'd go back on my part of the country in
      <i>anything.</i> And, anyway, we've wandered fourteen miles
      from the original argument. I'm telling you, I love you,
      and you're telling me everything about American
      civilization and medieval literature in answer. You've
      cluttered your answer all up with other issues. What I want
      to tell you is, that I love you and you're the one girl in
      the world for me. And what I want to know is, how much do
      you care for me, if any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think a lot of you, Allen,--as a friend. And knowing
      very definitely what I'm going to make of my life, I won't
      even analyze my feeling any further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha! You're afraid to. I'm coming on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I'm just thinking of other things; my career
      most of all. Going East to Uncle Harry Wentworth's again in
      the summer, for another. They go about a great deal, and
      he's wealthy and they're childless . . . and Mother thinks
      it's a great chance for me, and I do too." Laura was
      unaware that her mother had assisted Chance materially by
      adroitly worded letters concerning the young man in whose
      car she was sitting. "It reads like a story, Allen,--it's
      drama itself. I've told you about Grandmother Deal's
      aspirations that never amounted to anything. And here's
      more about it: When Grandmother was a young woman, she had
      a choice of two things . . . came to the parting of the
      ways, as it were. Two men loved her and wanted to marry
      her. She had to choose between Grandfather, whom she really
      loved, or a young doctor . . . I don't know his name, but
      he became a big New York surgeon. She chose Grandfather
      Deal, and came out here and went through that hard
      pioneering with him . . . whereas, if she had chosen the
      doctor and gone East, she might have had the career, for
      she had a lovely voice. Do you see the connection? Just
      like Grandmother, I'm making <i>my</i> choice . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To get yourself a nice young surgeon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, foolish. Carry out the thing Grandmother didn't do. It
      wasn't surprising that she didn't. Life was different then.
      Everyone was tied down. The old inhibitions were masters of
      girls' fates. She could hardly break away from any thought
      but doing the thing she did. But here I am . . . different
      . . . in a modern setting . . . a University education . .
      . free . . . sort of 'heir of the ages,' all that stuff,
      you know,--and I can choose deliberately. But I've got to
      be free . . . as free as the wind that blows, with no
      entanglements of any kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sound like a mule in a wire fence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Allen . . . lovely simile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed, and Laura went on: "I think and eat and
      sleep and talk in terms of writing." It was true. Even as
      she said it, that other person, who played so great a part
      in her life, was composing in her mind: "The girl spoke,
      earnestly, without emotion. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one in my life, up to date--not my parents--not even
      Miss Fisk or Professor Throckmortin, my two favorite
      instructors--none of the girls at The House, no one person
      has had as much influence over me as my Grandmother Deal.
      She had me with her much of the time and she always
      inspired me to do something fine--to find what was the most
      worthwhile thing in life and see it through. Soon after she
      died, I ran across a poem. It was like this:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "'Pain has been and grief enough and bitterness and
      crying.<br>
      Sharp ways and stony ways I think it was she trod,<br>
      But all there is to see now is a white bird flying<br>
      Whose blood-stained wings go circling high--circling up to
      God.'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't the faintest idea what or whom the author meant
      when she wrote it, or the real significance of it. That's
      the beauty of poetry, anyway. We can all put our own
      interpretation on it. To me, it was my grandmother who had
      known the bitterness and crying and had trod the sharp and
      stony ways, for her life, like all of those pioneer women,
      was terribly hard. And the line that just <i>thrills</i> me
      with meaning is, 'But all there is to see now is a white
      bird flying.' This is the first time I've ever told this to
      a soul . . . in fact, I don't <i>know</i> any one else I
      <i>would</i> tell it to, Allen--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mention it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen grinned and Laura laughed lightly. "But that line has
      grown to be sort of . . . what shall I call it? . . . an
      influence or an ideal or inspiration or something like that
      . . . to me. It's kind of a vision of things to
      come--happiness and success in a career. '<i>A white bird
      flying.'</i> I say it to myself lots of times . . . I don't
      know that I'll ever capture it, of course. . ." She turned
      to him, lovely and serious, all the laughter gone. "I've
      only <i>one</i> life to live, Allen, and I do so want to
      get the most out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, was serious. There was no laughter, now, for
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped an arm around her and caught up her hands. "And
      doesn't a home of your own and all it means . . . doesn't
      it seem to give 'the most out of life'? Can't you see that
      it would?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Allen," she shook her head. "I can see nothing at all
      . . ." She smiled up at his face bent low over her own. ".
      . . Nothing at all but a white bird flying."
    </p>
    <p>

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The month of May brought all of those final events so
      important to college students. One of the early dates was
      Ivy Day. When the smoke of battle had cleared, Bernice
      Fowler, efficient and capable Mortar Board, emerged
      triumphant as May Queen. Many of the co-eds on the campus
      shrugged their shoulders and said it was an empty honor,
      the result of intensive political strategy. Most of them
      would have given their souls to have been in her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shower in the morning, swift and sudden, threatening
      disastrous results for a time, suddenly stopped and left in
      its wake glorious sunshine and a sparkling campus. Suddenly
      there were the townspeople and students massing themselves
      for the annual parade. There were the processional by the
      military band and girls carrying the daisy chain entering
      the green triangle set aside for the ceremonies, a chorus
      of sorority representatives singing "Who will plant the
      Ivy?" and the pages announcing on silver trumpets the
      entrance of the queen. There was a great white throne
      encompassed about, not quite with angels, but by pretty
      coeds in appearance falling not far short of that
      appellation. There were the crowning of the Queen, the
      competitive inter-fraternity sing, the reading of the Ivy
      Day poem, the giving of the Ivy Day oration and the
      planting of the traditional ivy plant. In the outside world
      stocks went up and down, stores sold their commodities,
      hospitals cared for their sick, ships sailed to far
      countries. But here on the campus was a world within the
      other, a little world that had eyes only for the
      traditional exercises, and for the tapping of the Innocents
      and the masking of the Mortar Boards, with all their
      attendant enthusiasms and disappointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the time was coming to leave, it seemed to Laura a
      far sadder occasion than she had dreamed. She had a
      recurrence of the same feeling she had known when she was
      to be thrust out of the grades into High School, when she
      was to be pushed out of Cedartown into the University. Now,
      it seemed she could go on longer here more easily than she
      could take another new step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of May and the few days of June remaining on the
      school calendar passed into the shadows of days gone by.
      And Laura was in cap and gown in the huge coliseum where
      she had registered four short years before, standing with
      several hundred others, and hearing the Chancellor
      pronounce the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was home, and Cedartown seemed strangely quiet and
      uneventful, the blue and white room a silken cocoon that
      she must soon burst, the old grape arbor nothing but a
      shelter from the sun. She set the first of August for the
      date to leave home for Uncle Harry's. In the meantime, she
      assisted her mother with the homely daily tasks, read and
      wrote, strolled down to Kathie's often, chatted some with
      old Oscar Lutz, and drove almost every evening with Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen seemed older and more mature this summer. Away from
      the University, he had lost a little of that snappy way
      which had always come to him so readily. He seemed more
      serious, talking often about his work to Laura. To her
      surprise, she found herself growing interested in his
      experiments with feeding, his plans to set out a grove of
      walnut trees in his lower pasture, the success he was
      having with sudan grass, and she grieved with him over what
      he termed a piece of blundering on his part, losing some
      sheep with sweet-clover bloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked no more of his love for her, although he often
      spoke of Christmas and when she would return, as though
      some great change might have taken place in her mind by
      that time. Any reference to this, Laura only evaded,
      putting aside the thoughts that came to her as one avoids
      unpleasant realities. June and part of July drifted along
      dreamily enough. Sometimes Laura chided herself for being a
      two-faced person who pretended one thing even as she
      planned another. She ought to tell Allen all about that
      trip to Uncle Harry's. She ought not let him look forward
      to Christmas as he was doing. Just as Allen was too fine to
      be trifled with in any foolish, flirtatious way, so was he
      too fine to be hurt by the bungling of a friendship.
      Sometimes she wakened in the night, thought of herself with
      deepest scorn, and decided to tell him the truth. When she
      saw him again she would lose her courage, and all her
      nocturnal resolutions would go into nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she thought she would talk to Kathie about it.
      But she and Kathie lived in two different worlds. As much
      as Laura admired her cousin, she was admitting this summer
      that she was disappointed in her. Always light-hearted and
      gay, Kathie seemed more than that now. There was something
      strangely restless about her. She went to Omaha too often,
      and left Patty with Verna. It was as though both Cedartown
      and Omaha were her homes and she must attend every social
      event in each. She and Jimmie were seldom out together any
      more. The banking proposition had been a hard one the past
      few years and Jimmie, serious and conscientious as always,
      was giving the business the best that was in him. Uncle
      Mack came down often and together they would go over the
      notes. Laura had often heard her Uncle say, "The heart of
      the bank is the note-case. A good banker keeps his
      note-case clean, just as a housekeeper keeps her kitchen
      clean." And Jimmie, with his inclination to put his whole
      soul in anything, had been giving his every thought to
      keeping the bank in good condition in these perilous times.
      Kathie, in her light-hearted way, did not think it
      necessary that he give it so much thought and worry. She
      made sport of his conscientious endeavors, and not always
      with good taste. Several times Laura suspected that she
      openly embarrassed him before their friends. Lately she had
      been going to Omaha for longer periods, leaving Verna to
      take the entire charge of Patty. Laura disliked to speak of
      it to her mother, for Eloise was radical in her criticism,
      and Laura was genuinely fond of Kathie, even when she was
      disappointed in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar had changed too, this summer, but his was the
      natural change of age. He seemed much more feeble than at
      this time last year, Laura thought, as she lay in the
      hammock watching him now, fussing among his roses. Poor old
      man. He would be gone one of these days. She ought to do
      something for him. "I'll walk over and let him talk to me,"
      she told herself, "that's about the biggest treat any one
      can give him,--to make an audience for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. He was delighted beyond measure to see her
      slip through the opening in the privet hedge. There were
      low-hanging clouds in the west and when she spoke about it,
      the suggestion opened up a whole stream of talk: "Speakin'
      of storms,--" He sat down on the edge of the porch, and was
      off on a monologue highly pleasing to himself, if not his
      audience. "You know that there big cottonwood left standin'
      north of the cemetery? Well, I'll tell you somethin' about
      that. Marthy's and my first old house stood right over
      there a few yards beyond the pasture fence north of the
      cemetery. That big cottonwood up there on the hill is the
      last one of those I planted. It's powerful old . . . I
      could figger it up exact, but I won't stop. I mind as how,
      if I was away from the house in the field or at the barn or
      down in the pasture and see a storm come up, I'd always
      hot-foot it up for the house. She was always scairt o'
      storms. Never got over it. Lived through Injuns coming,
      rattlesnakes in the yard, wind and snow and blizzards.
      Never complained about 'em. But let a thunder and lightnin'
      storm come up and she was just a little girl. Always was. I
      mind as how, I never could see a storm comin' without
      droppin' everything and hurryin' up to the house to her.
      After she died . . . the first time there was a storm . . .
      Queer! . . . I come hurryin' home here. There she was . . .
      gone . . . safe, you might say, from storm . . . but
      couldn't get over she was waitin' for me to come and stay
      with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      In his tiresome old way he was repeating: "When we lived
      out there in that first house, no matter whether I was in
      the north cornfield . . . in the east quarter or down in
      the pasture . . . I'd always come up there through the
      draw. If it got dark, she'd set two lights in the windows.
      We had a kitchen with two windows about three . . . four .
      . . feet apart." He measured it off with his hand and the
      hoe. "There was a little cupboard atween the two windows.
      And if it got dark she'd set a light in each one. Always
      said most any one would have a light in one window, but I
      need never mistake anybody's lights for ours on a dark
      night, for she'd always have them two, about three . . .
      four . . . feet apart. Used to joke her quite a little
      about that. 'Marthy,' I'd say, 'suppose I'd come home
      tighter 'n' a fiddle some night . . . and be seein' double
      and get in the wrong house?'" And he laughed his high
      cracked old laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as I say, when a storm was comin', I'd hot-foot it
      up there, and when I'd get to the top o' the knoll where
      the big cottonwood tree still stands, I'd hoo-hoo and call
      out to her I was comin'. And when I'd come in she'd run to
      me and say: 'My! Oscar! I'm glad you're home. Now I'm not
      afraid.'" He said it diffidently, almost shyly, like a
      young lover. Laura looked at him, so old, so gaunt, with
      his huge bent frame and his ashen-gray cheeks flabbily
      wrinkled above his beard. How queer! How could one, as old
      as that, remember? How could love for another last through
      the years like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer, how all three little girls had to die one after the
      other." He was evidently speaking of his own children now.
      "One was diphtheria . . . never heard of anti-toxin. See
      her just choke up and die. One was tuberculosis . . .
      consumption, we called it. Didn't know what to do . . .
      just stuff up the cracks in the window so she wouldn't get
      night air. One was probably appendicitis, but never heard
      of it, just called it 'acute inflammation' and watched her
      go, too. Queer! Us old codgers ain't got any call to say
      times ain't better now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he said, with complete change of subject: "I used
      to play a jew's-harp: 'There Was an Old Miller Who Lived by
      the Mill' and 'Comin' Thru the Rye.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Childish, Laura thought. First you were a little child, and
      then you were mature, and then you were a child again.
      Well, that thought wasn't new. Others had thought that all
      out long ago. <i>Second childishness and mere oblivion,
      sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</i>
      And--<i>desire shall fade and man goeth to his long
      home.</i>

    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had one more week at home and the thought tortured
      her even while it satisfied. She wanted to make the most of
      it, to hold it to her heart as one fondles a precious
      thing. There was something vaguely painful in seeing her
      father come home from the office, care-worn and tired, and
      her mother go monotonously over all the household tasks
      each day. They would miss her. But so would they miss her
      no matter what she might be doing away from them. She felt
      a sort of patient fondness for Trib, now that so soon she
      was to see him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trib was seventeen now,--a queer mixture of man and boy.
      All his young life he had ridden hobbies up hills of
      enthusiasm, abandoned them one by one, and trudged down
      into valleys of neglect, only to find there steeds of
      different hue and temperament. One year it had been an
      enthusiasm for carpentering, in which he had made countless
      tool chests and benches and more or less wobbly pieces of
      lattice-work. One year he had been an embryo naturalist,
      every waking moment spent in watching birds through Laura's
      opera glasses or constructing nests for them, every spoken
      sentence a statement concerning his feathered friends. He
      had filled all available places with wrens' nests, made a
      martin house large enough for all the relatives, both blood
      and law, that might arrive, and built various fancy
      habitations for bluebirds, brown thrashers and flickers.
      When the winged bipeds for which the houses were intended
      failed to understand his kind motives, and the sparrows
      moved in en masse, Trib abandoned the whole interest with
      superb scorn. There had been a year of photography, with
      part of the cellar curtained off into dungeon-like
      quarters, where one, venturing in, fell over old magic
      lanterns and electric light bulbs, became entangled in
      coils of wire and rolls of films. Eloise had been in a
      state of exasperation and actual concern over these various
      interests, dilating long and with much detail upon her
      difficulties with Trib. This summer he had grown strangely
      quiet and read too many lightweight magazines. Laura,
      looking at his sleek dark head bent over one, felt a warmth
      of tenderness for her young brother, a vague disquietude
      that she was not to be near any more, not again to be an
      amused and exasperated onlooker at those boyish
      enthusiasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      July was slipping away in a procession of hot "corn
      weather" days. It made Laura think in contrast of the
      lovely times in the northern woods. She wished her father
      and mother might go up there, but the former seemed tied
      always to the day's grind and the latter with martyr-like
      spirit stayed by him, though she called attention quite
      frequently to the grace she exhibited in so doing. Some
      day, Laura thought, she would be in a position to take them
      all on such a trip, and others still more interesting. It
      gave her a warm feeling of contentment for her lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late afternoon of one of these last July days,
      dressing in cool white after her bath, Laura decided as she
      slipped into the fresh things, to go down to Kathie's. She
      could not have known the disturbing conditions in the
      lovely little English house or nothing would have taken her
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie was home from the bank, with the information that he
      was going to Lincoln on a business trip. Katherine had
      expected Jimmie to go with her on one of her
      all-too-frequent Omaha social journeyings,--and Jimmie was
      not going. Furthermore,--and aye, there was the
      rub,--Jimmie was quite frankly saying that he thought
      Kathie ought not to go either, that the weather was hot and
      Patty needed her. Words, which at first were only
      ironically polite, grew into words that were strong and
      bitter,--incriminations,--denunciations. And now Jimmie was
      stooping and kissing four-year-old Patty, giving one of her
      light corkscrew curls a playful pull, saying with
      pronounced sarcasm: "If your business interferes with your
      pleasure, Patty-girl, put off your business," and cool and
      calm with no word to Katherine, walking on out of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine's temper rose in a perfect storm of anger. So
      this was what their marriage had come to, had it? They were
      not on speaking terms. So she had married a man who was no
      gentleman, had she? Even as she said it, some inner voice
      reproved her, told her flatly that she knew "gentleman"
      fitted Jimmie in its finest sense. She felt furious and
      thwarted. She, Katherine Deal, who might have married any
      one of several Omaha men--men in her own set--was being
      treated like a child. That's what one got for marrying out
      of one's sphere, she told herself. Jimmie, earning his way
      through the University,--his mother a dowdy widow trying to
      make ends meet! Why had she gone out of her way to be crazy
      about him? She had been a perfect fool. Jimmie was
      commonplace,--plebeian, his people farmers. Blood would
      count. She had proved that. With no sense of the ludicrous,
      she was saying all these things to herself,--a girl whose
      grandparents on both sides had the same background that had
      been Jimmie's ancestors'. Like leaves in a whirlwind her
      thoughts rose fast and furiously. She would show Jimmie.
      She wouldn't be dictated to. Any time Jimmie could tell her
      what and what not to do! Criticising her, as though she
      were a poor excuse of a mother. Poor mother! She'd given
      birth to Patty, hadn't she? Little did a man know what that
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie had wanted a child. Well, he <i>had</i> a child now,
      thanks to her own agony. If she never did another thing for
      his child, never lifted her finger to care for her, she had
      already done enough in going through that; no father could
      know it. And now to be virtually told to stay at home and
      look after Patty, as though she were paid by the week.
      Bitter things, cruel things, chased each other through her
      infuriated mind. She would go now for sure. She would leave
      him. She would divorce him. That was easy nowadays. Dad
      would see her through. Dad always got her anything she
      wanted. All right. She had a new desire now,--the biggest
      desire in the world,--to hurt Jimmie,--to divorce him. Dad
      would help her see it through. And to-night she would go
      right along to Omaha to attend the party at the Fontenelle.
      She, a former duchess of Ak-Sar-Ben, staying home from a
      party to look after a man's child because he had virtually
      told her to. He could have put off the trip,--"bankers'
      called meeting over the assessments of the guarantee fund."
      Blah! That was good, that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began packing, throwing things in a bag without much
      thought. If she only had her car. Jimmie had his nerve to
      drive it. The car was hers. Oh well, <i>she</i> could ride
      on a dust jolting train or in a bus while Jimmie sped
      toward Lincoln in the new convertible coup. The house was
      hers, too. Dad had given them both to her. Dad had done
      everything. Jimmie's very position was made by Dad buying
      the controlling interest in the bank. She would think a man
      would be ashamed to take all that from his father-in-law.
      Again that little inner voice which seemed keeping up with
      all her furious statements was reminding her that Jimmie
      had protested the gift of the new house, discouraged buying
      the banking interest if it were purely on his account,
      absolutely refused the gift of a car for himself. She would
      take the afternoon train to Omaha, and when she returned,
      some one of the old crowd would take pity on her and drive
      her back. She enjoyed the pitiful thought of herself
      accepting a charity ride from some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would come back this time. But not for long. <i>Not for
      long.</i> There would be a lot of things to see to and then
      she would take Patty and go home for good. To take Patty
      away from Jimmie! That would punish him more than anything
      in the world. Evidently he didn't care anything about
      <i>her</i> any more. It wouldn't be any punishment for him
      to lose her. He could be free then to go and pick out some
      prissy thing that would cook and bake and scrub and have
      his babies. That was the kind of girl he wanted. Maybe he
      had her in mind already. In the meantime, she could make
      him suffer to lose Patty. She was cramming things in the
      bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished packing, took her bath, and gave directions to
      Verna about Patty. It was then that Laura came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine's fury rose again. Now that she had Laura to talk
      to, she freed her mind of countless bitter things:
      "Imagine! Dictating to <i>me!</i> Telling me I can and
      can't do this or that. Insinuating I'm neglecting his
      child. What child <i>ever</i> had the care Patty has? Tell
      me that. Neither you nor I. Dr. Rayburn for one thing, Dr.
      Moss for another, Miss Lawrence's model pre-kindergarten
      school. He said I cared more about playing bridge when she
      was at the pre-kindergarten school than I did the
      psychology of it I was always pretending I was interested
      in. He said, 'Psychology be damned. A baby needs her mother
      and not a scientific textbook.' He said she'll always
      remember Verna more than she will me,--that Verna's with
      her more and understands her better." The words tumbled
      over each other in their harshness and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had never seen Kathie in such a state and the sight
      was unlovely. She was deeply astonished and grieved and so
      embarrassed that it seemed she could not endure the
      sensation. Kathie and Jimmie! She had loved them, idolized
      them. Ever since they were married they had seemed to stand
      for all that was attractive and ideal. Fine, clean,
      upstanding Jimmie, and lovely, laughing Kathie. She thought
      of them as the bride and groom who had settled in this
      beautiful little home a few short years ago. With an ache
      in her heart so intense that it hurt her very body, she
      listened to Kathie's tirade, dully watched her write and
      tear up and rewrite several notes to Jimmie in the vain
      hope of getting one which would be scornful enough to suit
      her. She saw her kiss Patty good-by, give Verna a final
      direction and leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way on the train to Omaha, Katherine Buchanan
      constructed and revised her tale of oppression in readiness
      to tell her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven, she was in Omaha--at seven-twenty in her
      girlhood's lovely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma Deal was delighted to see her daughter, her youngest
      child. Emma in her sixties, now, was gray haired,
      beautifully preserved with all the modern preservation that
      money can accomplish. She had a complacent, easy,
      good-natured way about her which gave her a certain
      serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad's not here," were almost her first words. "Has to miss
      the party. Larry Albrett and the Millers are going with
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Dad?" Katherine's head ached a little from
      emotional fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lincoln. A called bank meeting. He phoned just before he
      left." Her mother was serene, unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine emitted a feeble "Well! Jimmie's gone, too."
      Suddenly it seemed a little ridiculous to tell her mother
      all she had intended. It was rather flat to blow in with a
      tale of being the victim of a tyranny as terrible as she
      had conceived herself to be, and find her mother apparently
      a victim of the same cruelty, and taking it as
      unconcernedly as though it were of no consequence. However,
      that did not account for the other bitter things Jimmie had
      said,--those about her neglect of Patty. She steeled
      herself against the thought of him. So Larry Albrett was
      going to be in the party, was he? Larry had liked her a lot
      at one time. And Larry was fun. Later, in her own old room,
      she slipped the rose-colored gown over her creamy white
      shoulders and looked at her slim, supple figure in the
      glass. "Kathie, you don't look a day older than when you
      left home," she told the lovely girl, looking out at her.
      "But you would. . ." She curled a scornful lip, "You would,
      if you took your family as seriously as Jimmie thinks you
      should."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went home from Kathie's in such an unhappy state that
      it bordered upon physical illness. With that old sense of
      allegiance to Kathie which she always possessed, she would
      not tell her mother of the agitated scene. She was in her
      blue-and-white room with closed doors, trying to settle her
      own agitation before helping her mother with the supper. As
      much as she thought of Kathie, she knew Kathie was the one
      to blame. Jimmie was fine. Jimmie had no doubt said bitter
      things. But they were true. Kathie <i>was</i> in the wrong.
      She <i>didn't</i> pay much attention to Jimmie or Patty or
      her house any more. Over and over she thought of the
      miserably unhappy atmosphere in the lovely little house,
      all the more bitter for the contrasting thoughts of the
      happiness she had seen there. "I guess Tennyson was right,"
      she said to herself, "that 'a sorrow's crown of sorrow is
      remembering happier days.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished she could confide in Allen about it for the
      sheer sake of self relief, but she knew the old clannish
      attitude of the Deals would not let her. Even then, her
      thoughts began running riotously through a newly discovered
      by-path. If it were she and Allen--they would not have
      handled the situation so poorly. They would have--She
      called back her truant thoughts sharply, soundly provoked
      at their strange stampede, and concentrated on Kathie and
      Jimmie. Kathie was selfish. She had always had everything
      she wanted. And now, having everything, she was restless
      and self-centered. Jimmie, having stood a great deal, had
      evidently exploded to-day. So that was marriage! Luckily
      she was not going into it. She went downstairs with the
      sensation of an emotional depression too deep for comfort.

      Katherine went back to her home late in the evening of the
      second day. Larry Albrett drove her down. The night was
      lovely. Larry, who had "thought a lot" of Kathie, once, had
      not changed. Which is to say he was still single, still
      flitting about taking his pleasures where he found them,
      still thinking a lot of Kathie. At least so he told Kathie.
      And Kathie, not yet thirty, gay, blithe, loving the flesh
      pots tremendously, listened. The night was lovely and she
      was a little foolish. It was very late when they drove up
      to the house. Lights shone from Verna's room and from the
      upper hall. Kathie had a swift intuition then that
      something was not right, but put it aside, and asked Larry
      in. She was not going to slip in like a young girl sending
      her lover away, she told herself. Whether Jimmie liked it
      or not made no great difference now.

      They went in, and Kathie, excusing herself, ran upstairs to
      see how everything was after the two days' absence. Jimmie
      was not in his room. She slipped down the soft carpeted
      hall to Verna's room. Verna was there in a chair and Jimmie
      in pajamas and robe was bending low over her, his arms . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, not that! Not Jimmie! Katherine felt a definite
      illness. Not good clean stolid dependable Jimmie!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped unnoticed into the room. Slim, cool,
      disdainful, she gazed at Jimmie's broad back. Verna looked
      around and caught Katherine's scornful expression.
      Immediately Jimmie was turning and raising miserable, angry
      eyes. And then, Katherine saw for the first time that Verna
      held Patty in her lap, a limp little Patty with scarlet
      cheeks and half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's sick," Jimmie said shortly. "Dr. Benton is on the
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was hanging over Patty now, remembering Larry
      only long enough to say: "Go down and thank Larry Albrett
      for bringing me, Jimmie." And Mr. Lawrence Albrett,
      standing awkwardly about for a few moments, made his escape
      comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She didn't feel good before Mr. Buchanan came," Verna was
      explaining. "She wanted to come here in my bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Benton came,--and the next morning, Dr. Rayburn from
      Omaha. By afternoon old Dr. Baker, Katherine's uncle from
      Lincoln, and young Dr. Fred Baker, her cousin, were both
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed days of fighting,--dark days, with the
      doctors coming and going, with a Cedartown day nurse and an
      Omaha night nurse, with townspeople slipping around to the
      back door to inquire how things were now; with Katherine,
      hollow-eyed, and without make-up, her hair skinned back
      tightly over her ears, and with Jimmie home from the bank,
      each avoiding the other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came and passed that Laura was to have left. It did
      not take Kathie's pitiful "Don't go, Lolly," to keep her.
      She put the leave-taking completely out of her mind
      until--Laura's heart ached with the uncertainty of what
      that awful word "until" might mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was worried with the others, but she did not
      hesitate to say: "Well, I'm sorry, but Katherine needed
      just such a lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mother." It was Laura. "I think that's hard-hearted.
      How <i>can</i> you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine's mother, well-gowned and well-groomed and sick
      with worry, came down from Omaha in a Packard. Jimmie's
      mother, in a homemade dress with a biscuit of hair on top
      of her head, and sick with worry, came over from
      Meadowville in a rattling Ford. And Mrs. Mackenzie Deal,
      the Omaha banker's wife, and Mrs. Hattie Buchanan, who
      managed her own chicken farm, held on to each other in the
      depths of their despair. And upstairs in the dim light,
      there was a little Patty who moaned and cried out and threw
      herself about or lay quietly and inert in her coma. There
      were temperatures that hovered between 105 and 106, and one
      frightful night when they dropped suddenly to 96 and she
      began chilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she called out sharply, and always when she did
      so, it was "Daddie" or "Verna" she wanted. Laura sensed
      Katherine's agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's delirious, Kathie," Laura tried to tell her. "She
      doesn't <i>know</i> it's Verna and Jimmie she's calling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That makes it all the worse," Katherine said in a dry dead
      voice. And there was nothing for Laura to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mackenzie Deal, bald, heavy, prosperous-looking, his big
      round florid face looking grotesquely scared and flabby,
      came down with another child specialist. He had been able
      to accomplish a great many things in his life on account of
      his executive ability and his money. Only once or twice
      before had he been face to face with a great Force before
      which he was helpless,--the time Stanley had gone to war,
      for one. It brought back that old helpless sensation
      now,--that some tremendous Force, before which he was puny
      and impotent, was stepping in between him and his deepest
      desire. He had always been able to give Kathie everything
      she wanted. Every whim had been granted, and now he was not
      able to give her the thing she wanted most in the
      world,--her baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat out on a garden bench in the back yard, and watched
      the windows of the room where the white-gowned nurse passed
      and repassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother John, home from the office, had come over. He
      came around into the back yard and sat down with no word.
      He and John had not been on the best of terms the last few
      years. That banking controversy had always loomed between
      them. Sharp words had been spoken. Now, they sat together
      on a garden bench and said nothing. Once Mack cleared his
      throat: "Queer how Mother always pulled us through all the
      sicknesses, wasn't it? No child specialists,--no modern
      drugs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of her, too," John said briefly. "Onion
      poultices and castor oil and catnip tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour or more they sat there and said nothing, while
      the white-robed figure passed and repassed the upstairs
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house, Kathie, watching the nurse, was hanging on
      the very lift of her eyebrow. The young woman had been a
      classmate of hers in Central High. She had never paid any
      attention to her then. Now she was saying to herself: "If
      Patty pulls through I'll have her down here often. I'll ask
      her if she wants to have a room here with us when she's in
      this community nursing."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung on to Jimmie's mother, too. How good Jimmie's
      mother was, so capable and motherly and confident that
      Patty would make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz came tap-tapping around on the cement walk
      to the back door, bringing a bunch of carrots tied with a
      red string. Kathie would have laughed at any other time.
      Now she took the carrots, scrubbed to a salmon polish, and
      asked the old man to stay awhile. She had never voluntarily
      asked him in before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in and sat miserably in a kitchen chair, his cane
      between his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why couldn't it be me got to go?" he said to Kathie. "I
      wouldn't a-cared."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathie laid a slim hand on his head for a moment, and then
      slipped back upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes they pull through," the old man said to Laura.
      "You can't tell. I mind as how when I was a little fellow
      back in Michigan, Henry had the scarlet fever. For two days
      they thought he was just about gone. Watchers set up with
      him . . . nothin' more to do . . . just wait. Sudden like,
      he seemed to take a bit of a turn. They thought he was
      brightenin' up a little before goin'. People do sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse came in and got a hot-water bottle. Laura went
      out of the room. Katherine came back in. People moved
      about, paying no heed to the old man's tale. He told the
      first of it to one person, the middle portion of it to
      another, the end to a third. It was Katherine who was near
      him now. "When he got over the crisis . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, did he pull through, Uncle Oscar?" She did not even
      know of whom he was telling the long-winded story. All she
      wanted to know was that sometime, somewhere, some one
      pulled through a severe illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he? I just tell you, he did. Wasn't he your
      grandfather? But he couldn't talk. Had lost his little
      speech entirely. We was all sad about Henry never being
      able to talk again. I mind as how when he was convalescing,
      Ma and Pa had to go to town on business . . . sign some
      papers or something . . ." Katherine had gone and Laura and
      Jimmie's mother were his audience. "Ma cautioned us to
      watch Henry good and keep him amused, and under no
      consideration to let him climb down out of the old crib she
      had him bolstered up in, with pillows at his back. We kept
      showin' him things and tryin' to amuse him, and we sort o'
      run out o' things to entertain him with. I mind as how I
      climbed up in a chair and was rummagin' around on a shelf,
      and come across an old yellow-handled jackknife that Henry
      had thought a lot of and cut himself on a half-dozen times,
      and I turned around from where I was up high on the chair
      and said: 'Looky, Humpy, . . . that was our nick-name for
      him . . . 'looky, Humpy,' I says, 'what's that?' And Henry
      reached up both hands excited and says: 'Dat's my knishe.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was listening in spite of her lack of interest. "And
      mebbe you think us kids didn't holler that he talked." His
      cracked old voice went on. "We was all crazy to be the
      first to tell Ma and Pa. We took turns of stayin' by Henry
      fifteen minutes at a time, and lettin' the other kids go
      down the road a piece to meet the folks. I mind as how I
      was in the bunch that was down the road when we see 'em
      come over the hill. I can hear us kids yet in my mind
      yellin' and screechin' at the top of our voices, 'Humpy can
      talk.' 'Humpy can talk.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Those in the kitchen sat ready to obey the order for ice or
      hot water; one never knew what the next moment would bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mind as how Henry got his nick-name,--Humpy," the old
      man told them. No one in particular was listening. He did
      not seem to care especially. He appeared to be telling it
      more for his own pleasure than anything else. "Was too
      little to go to school, but was bright,--always pesterin'
      Ma to learn to him to read. Ma gave him his letters and he
      was doin' right smart with 'em. Give him a few little words
      to spell, but he was always gettin' <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>
      mixed up, so Ma says, 'You can always tell <i>m</i> because
      it's got three humps and <i>n</i> has just got two.' Next
      day, Ma give him the word 'man' to spell, and Henry says as
      chipper as a squirrel, 'Three humps, a, two humps.'
      Everybody roared, and we called him Humpy clear up to the
      time he got to sparkin' Sarah, and he said he'd lick
      anybody that called him that again." And the old man, in
      complete forgetfulness of the sorrow in the house, chuckled
      to himself for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great crisis impending plunged Laura into the depths of
      an emotion more painful than she had ever know. Flesh and
      blood seemed to cry out against the terrible delay. Each
      night one wondered what news the morning would bring, each
      morning what secret the coming day held. Sometimes Allen
      drove up and went over home with her. Once she turned to
      him at her own doorstep: "Allen, life is too terrible. How
      can one stand it? It holds such heartbreaking things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that," said Allen simply, "is one reason why two
      people who care for each other should meet it together."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when there seemed nothing more to do, when one
      almost asked for relief for Patty, one way or the other,
      there came the faint indication of a change for the better,
      so extremely slight that it seemed the waft of a
      butterfly's wing would change the brighter symptom. Another
      bit of hope,--and another,--while doctors and nurses hung
      over her and waited,--and then the verdict,--she would pull
      through,--with Katherine crying and crying, with Jimmie's
      arms around her. And Jimmie crying, too. And Laura crying
      because they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went home, worn to a shred, mentally and physically.
      So this was marriage! Down to the depths of the valley of
      the shadow of death and up to the stars of the heavens with
      gratitude and joy. All this then she would avoid. Life for
      her would not hold such depths and heights of emotion. In
      more pleasant places her life would be lived,--by the side
      of still waters her work would be accomplished.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      With that amazing power for recuperating that children
      possess, Patty made noticeable strides toward a complete
      recovery. There was only one nurse on duty now; only one
      trip each day by Dr. Benton. All of Kathie's latent
      motherhood was in the supremacy. She half quarreled with
      the nurse over serving her child. "Anything you want Mother
      to do, Patty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." Patty knew her mind immediately. "Daddie read me
      some stories. I wish you'd read 'em all over to me, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were they, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bible stories. One was about David and Goliath and the
      Lord let David cut down a big bean stalk; and the other was
      about Jack the giant killer, and the Lord come to him and
      told him to take a little stone and put it in a sling and
      when the giant come out, to shoot him in the stomach."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine, seeing Laura come in, slipped down to tell her
      the funny thing Patty had just said. The two girls laughed
      together. "Isn't it lovely and comfortable just to stay
      home and have Patty back . . . back from wherever she was .
      . . ?" Katherine broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lolly . . . do you know something . . . all the time the
      doctors were fighting and I was just ice and stone, all
      that time . . . day and night . . . I kept thinking I had
      tight hold of Granny Deal's hand, and I kept saying over
      and over: 'Granny Deal, ask God not to let her die . . .
      please, Granny Deal, ask God not to let her die.' And I
      said it so much, sometimes I had it turned around the
      opposite way and would be saying: 'God, ask Granny Deal not
      to let her die.' Anyway," she added, with a little
      deprecating laugh, "they've always seemed kind of alike to
      me . . . God and Granny Deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay, laughing Kathie had known her first real anxiety and
      temporarily, at least, it had left her serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't life lovely anyway?" she said to Laura in an
      exuberance of thankfulness. "I mean just common, ordinary,
      everyday life, when there's no black cloud hanging over
      you,--just hollyhocks in the back yard, dinner cooking,
      Jimmie coming home. . ." She broke off and averted her eyes
      momentarily. "Lolly, I want to get something out of my
      system. I know you'll be shocked, but I think you'll be
      forgiving too. You and I have always looked at things
      differently. And I can't imagine you getting into the
      muddle I was in. But that day when my temper blew up like a
      new oil-gusher . . . and the day after . . . I played
      around a lot with Larry Albrett. Well, Laura, when I came
      home I was thinking of divorce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathie . . . not divorcing Jimmie! Why . . . how
      <i>could</i> you . . . I can't think . . . he's so
      altogether fine . . . and there's no grounds anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Incompatibility," Katherine announced blithely. "It covers
      a multitude of things . . . selfish and otherwise. It's
      true. And then, Patty . . . why, Laura . . . listen,--isn't
      this the funniest thing you ever heard?" She laughed gayly
      as though at a huge joke. "Listen to this, Lolly:
      <i>In-com-pat-i-bility,</i> and then
      <i>In-Come-Patty</i>-bility. Isn't that <i>funny?"</i> And
      she went off into another gale of high laughter. Laura
      looked at her in amazement. Wasn't that just like Kathie?
      You could not change people. No matter what happened,
      people never really changed. Out from under the black cloud
      of impending death, Kathie was her old self. Having slipped
      away from the shadows, Kathie would face life again as
      always,--light and careless, and airy as thistles in
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura set the third Thursday in August then for leaving. On
      Tuesday afternoon she and Allen drove down to Nebraska
      City, in order that Laura might see Bernice Fowler before
      going East. The hush of a warm August afternoon hung over
      the old town on the river that had seen so much of
      Nebraska's early history. From there, William Hill had gone
      out to blaze a path through the wilderness. From there, had
      started the long trains of oxen-drawn freighters to cross
      the then barren plains to Cherry Creek, later Denver. From
      there the first attempt was made to freight across the
      plains by means of steam. There slaves were once sold on
      Nebraska soil. There lived J. Sterling Morton, the man who
      originated Arbor Day, and the first Secretary of
      Agriculture. There the first newspaper in the state was
      printed, and prophetically enough, the first article set in
      type was entitled "Agriculture." The promise of the
      prophecy is magnificently fulfilled, for the rich soil of
      the rolling hills in this portion of eastern Nebraska is
      covered with corn and great orchards and vineyards. One of
      the greatest apple, cherry and grape countries in the world
      lies in this hollow of the Missouri Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one at the Fowler home, and a passing neighbor
      volunteered the information that the family had gone over
      into Iowa for the day. There was extra time then on their
      hands, and the two young people decided to spend it out at
      Arbor Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mile west of the city it lies--this estate called Arbor
      Lodge--on a highway known as the old Steam Wagon Road
      because of its connection with those early attempts at
      steam transportation. There are sixty-five acres of ground
      surrounding a beautiful colonial mansion of a half hundred
      rooms. There are acres of maples, elms, oaks, pines,--all
      the planting of J. Sterling Morton, the original owner, or
      of those in charge of the estate. But when Mr. Morton
      brought his bride, Carolyn Joy Morton, to the spot in 1855
      it was native prairie with no sign of a white inhabitant.
      Indeed, Indians had ceded the land to the Government but a
      short time previously, and were still ambling freely over
      the homestead site. The Mortons selected a spot on a hill
      near the Missouri, looking toward the high Iowa bluffs, and
      built what was then considered a notable structure,--even
      though but three-roomed,--the only shingled house between
      Nebraska City and the Rocky Mountains. Here they lived and
      raised their sons, and with open-house hospitality welcomed
      all comers in that early day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the homestead blossomed under the hands of these two
      nature lovers,--fruit trees, shade trees, evergreens,
      flowers, shrubs, vines surrounded the home,--and that
      portion of the prairie was transformed into a spot of
      beauty. Twice the original home has been remodeled, until
      now it stands, a stately white mansion of fifty-two rooms,
      with white semicircular porches on three sides, supported
      by massive two-story columns. Mr. Joy Morton, the oldest
      son of the sturdy pioneer, and who became the owner upon
      the death of his father, formally presented the entire
      property to the State of Nebraska in 1923. J. Sterling
      Morton gave Arbor Day to the nation. And now, Nebraska,
      with the same hospitality shown by the original owner,
      welcomes the nation to Arbor Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen and Laura entered the park through its wide brick
      gates and stopped on the driveway a moment to gaze upon the
      monument of the great tree planter,--the huge bronze statue
      standing in front of a background of dense evergreens.
      Across from the monument on the other side of the drive,
      they looked over at the log cabin erected there as a
      memorial to the old pioneers,--a replica of the typical
      house of the day for those settlers who made their homes
      along the wooded river banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not anything so gay and giddy for our ancestors, though,
      Allen," Laura said. "The soddies and the dugouts farther
      out in the state for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll say. I'll bet there weren't enough trees in the whole
      Stove Creek district to put up this house," Allen added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If humble beginnings have to start all over after every
      third generation, Allen,--it's your sons that will have to
      roll up their shirt sleeves again," she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up through the brick-paved driveway between the stately
      trees they rode, turned to the right and passed through the
      arboretum, skirted the tall pines and parked the car near
      the stables. On foot then they went over to the stately
      white mansion, walked past the huge white columns of the
      north wing, through similar white columns at the main
      entrance and into the reception hall with its blue
      hangings. There they registered in the guest book: <i>Laura
      Lee Deal, Cedartown,</i> and <i>Allen S. Rinemiller,
      Cedartown.</i> Granddaughter of Will and Abbie Deal and
      grandson of Gus and Christine Reinmueller, who only a few
      years later than the Mortons, had come into the state in
      their covered wagons on the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bunch of tourists was just ahead of them, and the two
      joined the sightseers who were being conducted through the
      mansion by the caretaker. There was the usual conglomerate
      group of people to be found in any sight-seeing trip,--an
      old lady being helped along by another scarcely less old, a
      middle-aged man and a fat daughter in her teens, a woman
      with two children in a chronic state of pushing noisily
      forward and being as noisily yanked back, two bored
      gum-chewing youths, and a deaf old man who wanted to argue
      dates and data with the lecturer,--and they two. The only
      sightseers of their own age and apparently education, it
      gave them a sense of oneness, a closer companionship
      because of the contrast and strangeness of the rest of the
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking on and amused, they followed the little group into
      the room at the north of the hall, a huge room with high
      beamed walnut ceiling and deep red hangings. "The family
      library it was," the lecturer was explaining, "but called
      the Title Room now." On the walls the various owners of the
      property were represented,--the buffalo and the Indians as
      claimants of the first rights, the Spanish ownership,
      Napoleon representing the period of French ownership, and
      then Uncle Sam who came into possession by the purchase of
      1803. Straight from the Federal Government J. Sterling
      Morton had secured the rights to the land, and now, a gift
      from his son, the State of Nebraska owned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave the two a sudden sense of pride, that so recently
      as their own grandfathers' time, a friend of their
      grandparents had wrested this garden spot from the raw
      homestead lands of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retracing their steps to the south of the main hall, they
      came to the drawing-room with its silk tapestried walls,
      and its fine old mahogany furniture. They were enjoying
      themselves. They nudged each other at times, in a moment of
      suppressed and ingrowing mirth, and caught at each other's
      hands once or twice as the conductor related a bit of
      historical pathos of those early days. For a time they
      stood in front of the pictures of J. Sterling Morton and
      Carolyn Joy Morton as they looked when, bride and groom,
      they had crossed the Missouri and come into the new land
      not yet ceded to the Government by the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just think what it meant to her . . . and to our own
      grandmothers, for that matter," Laura said in a low voice.
      Every one was speaking in that hushed tone of voice one
      uses before a shrine,--every one, that is, but the two
      noisy children and the deaf old man; the former constantly
      pushing forward to look up the cavernous fireplace, and
      being as constantly yanked back by their mother's hand in
      some sort of hasty posterior clutching, and the latter
      raising his voice in occasional querulous contradiction of
      the guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty fine work, I'll say," Allen was looking at the
      firm, strong features of the man who did so much for the
      raw new state. But Laura, questioningly, looked only at the
      sweet young face of the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the sun-parlor they went, with its cathedral-glass
      skylight and its French doors opening upon the wide expanse
      of lawn; and came then to the Denver room which the guide
      explained was part of the original building, and that it
      was named the Denver room because General Denver occupied
      it while he was negotiating the treaty with the Pawnees.
      This and the Document room, where the glass cases were
      lined with letters and documents all relating to the events
      of an early day, gave the young people a sense of closer
      connection with those days than they had ever felt. But it
      was when they had crossed the hall to the dining room with
      its beamed ceiling, its walnut woodwork, its china closets
      with portions of the first set of dishes used by the bride
      and groom, that Laura began to sense a feeling of reality
      of those young people who had made a home on the prairie. A
      little colored china hen placidly spreading her little
      colored china wings to form the cover of a dish, quite
      suddenly brought a swift mist to Laura's eyes. It was
      foolish, she told herself; she knew nothing about the
      history of the quaint little dish,--but something moved her
      unaccountably for a moment. Legal documents and letters,
      Indian relics and mementoes, pictures of steam wagons and
      of Presidential Cabinets; not one had possessed the quality
      of bringing home to her the life of the young bride so far
      away from family and friends as a little china hen
      spreading her little china wings over a dish. Had Carolyn
      Joy Morton brought it from her old home across the Illinois
      and Iowa prairies? The other tourists were asking of this
      and that, having pointed out to them the silver-marked
      chairs in which President and Mrs. Cleveland had sat,
      surveying the old silver service presented to Mr. and Mrs.
      Morton on their twenty-fifth anniversary; but Laura Deal
      stood looking only at the little humble dish, unaccountably
      touched by the living presence of a young woman who had
      left all, to brave the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen was waiting for her at the portieres of another room,
      and she came out of the mood into which she had fallen, to
      follow him into the music room where there stood an upright
      piano, one of the first to come into the state. She let her
      fingers slide over an octave or two and the keys gave forth
      a faint tinkling sound, that to her vivid imagination
      seemed a musical note from out of the past. "You can't
      quite think of playing 'When My Sugar Walks Down the
      Street' or 'Yes, Sir, That's My Baby,' can you?" she said
      to Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the wide mahogany stairway they passed to the landing,
      where hung the huge J. Haskell Coffin painting of the
      Pawnee Indians signing away their claims to Nebraska
      Territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was signed right out here near Arbor Lodge in 1857,"
      Allen was saying. "Doesn't that sort of get you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they stood looking at the shining brown skins
      of the Indians in ceremonial dance, and at the figures of
      Mr. and Mrs. Morton and General Denver as they watched.
      Then they were going up the stairway to the room that was
      still furnished as it had been the day President and Mrs.
      Cleveland occupied it. From the balcony under the porch,
      they looked down the long brick paved driveway separating
      the pine grove from the arboretum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was unaccountably touched again by a visit to Mrs.
      Morton's bedroom, which stood just as she, herself, had
      furnished it a half century before,--bird's-eye-maple
      furniture, oil paintings, tidies, splashers, washbowls and
      pitchers,--all the old-fashioned furnishings of another
      age. There was a little glass inkstand--Had the young bride
      used it in writing home? Had she sent words of loneliness
      and homesickness? Or pride and pleasure in the new
      undertaking? She wondered why she, herself, was always
      touched by such infinitesimal things. Their very homeliness
      and lack of worth seemed connecting the past with the
      present all the more. It was true, she thought, that the
      big things awe us but the little things touch us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other second-floor rooms contained countless relics of
      that early time,--an old sewing-machine and melodeon,
      slippers and hand-made baby clothes,--mementoes of a bygone
      era.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Laura and Allen came out of the mansion, something
      hung over them,--something which made them strangely
      quiet,--a bit of glamour from the early days, a sense of
      the heritage that had been bequeathed to them, a common
      knowledge of that close companionship they had just
      experienced, and above all, a sudden realization that the
      afternoon was waning and that a train was going east.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the mansion they passed through a graveled path in the
      lovely lawn to the stables, used now as a storage for the
      various old equipages that had been used in different
      periods of the past. In the first room stood a coach once
      used on the old Overland line running between Lexington and
      Fort Kearney, and driven by Buffalo Bill; so high that the
      driver's seat was far above Laura's head, and the
      musty-smelling antique seemed a top-heavy affair. The
      leather had hardened into a substance resembling cracked
      and brown wood. The wheels were enormous wooden affairs,
      the back ones rounding up over the windows of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two peered into the dusky interior; Laura, with some
      misgivings that the spirit of a departed Indian might not
      suddenly utter a ghostly war-whoop and send a phantom arrow
      through the old vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't see that times have changed so much, though,"
      Allen said. "Now, a highwayman merely rides up in a
      high-powered car and instead of the arrow, shoots off his
      mouth with 'Hand 'em over.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the coach stood a vehicle still higher, but of a
      later vintage,--the four-in-hand brake used by one of the
      Morton sons in the days when he drove four sleek
      high-steppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The king's horses <i>and</i> the king's men,'" Allen sang
      in his unmusical voice. He was gazing into the glass case
      that held the harnesses which had once graced the proud
      four. It, too, looked hardened and dull, all the life of
      the leather gone, like the sap from old trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sauntered into the next room, where a dozen outmoded
      vehicles stood in two lines facing each other across the
      sunny room. An old fire-engine of a half century before
      came first, then the worn-looking phaeton used by J.
      Sterling Morton in his trips to town. A Stanhope phaeton, a
      surrey with frayed fringe still jauntily rippling around
      the canopy top, and a heavy cumbersome carriage completed
      the one row. Across from these more common vehicles stood
      those evidently for formal occasions; a three-seated affair
      all in gay tan-colored leather, a taxi, a Chippendale, and
      two broughams. Laura was fascinated, as she always was with
      anything which roused her sentiments. She peered into the
      dark interior of one of the broughams, with its elegant
      tufted leather upholstery, so glossy that it looked like
      ancient black satin; into the dusky inside of the once
      gorgeous taxi; imagined gay parties of young people going
      out in the Chippendale; wondered which one of the equipages
      was driven up through the long paved driveway with
      President and Mrs. Cleveland.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appeared human, the dozen or more vehicles of other
      generations, standing there in mute memory of a day that
      was dead. They seemed the epitome of a grandeur that had
      come to the prairie country, of a long gone hospitality
      that had been fostered by a prairie lover. The whole period
      seemed to come alive to her sensitive imagination,--the
      people of the times, substantial and courageous, walked and
      talked with her. For the first time she was sensing to-day
      a romance in her own Midwest, a glamour over the lives of
      her own people. She wished she could hold to her heart the
      fleeting sensation until she could get pencil and paper.
      She wished she could catch it and hold it between the
      covers of a book.

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the stables, Laura and Allen strolled around for a
      time among the trees of the arboretum and perfunctorily
      read the names on the brass plates of the shaggy old
      trunks, criticizing each other pertly about their
      pronunciations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Juniperus virginiana, Red Cedar, 1868."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Acer saccharium, soft maple planted in 1871."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Pinus nigra austriaca, Austrian Pine, 1871."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the mansion in an oval plot of lawn, they came
      to a dwarfed spruce with a stone collar about its base.
      "It's the tree Mrs. Morton brought from Colorado in a
      tomato can over fifty years ago," Laura told Allen. They
      both stooped down to read the words cut into the stone, for
      the low hanging branches of the Englemann spruce hid the
      carving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura read the inscription aloud and very slowly, for the
      words were not especially clear in the rounding cement:
      "Arbor Lodge Homestead," she read in her low throaty voice,
      "was settled June, 1855, by J. Sterling Morton and his wife
      Carolyn Morton. Together . . . they lived . . . hereon . .
      . up to June 29 . . . 1881 . . . when . . . the . . . light
      . . . went . . . out."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood up, neither speaking, both touched by the simple
      words, as though into the brief poignant statement had gone
      all the love of a man for a mate. Instinctively, Laura's
      fingers sought Allen's, and together without words, they
      turned and walked down the graveled path and on down the
      steps to the sunken gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sturdy J. Sterling Morton and Carolyn, his bride,
      Grandmother Deal, old Oscar Lutz and his Marthy, Allen's
      German grandparents, Gus and Christine Reinmueller,--what
      did they have in their lives that gave them such fortitude
      decades ago here on the wild prairie?
    </p>
    <p>
      Past the old brick walls and lovely close-clipped hedges
      separating the different parts of the Italian gardens, the
      two young people strolled to the rose arbors, scenes of a
      thousand thousand blossoms in the earlier part of the year.
      Retracing their steps back past the geranium beds, they
      walked on over the lush green grass to a sundial.
      Simultaneously and haltingly, as they made out the hewn
      words, they began to read aloud the quaint inscription cut
      from the gray stone: "Hours Fly," they read, and "Flowers
      Die." They paused for the next wording and then went on in
      their fresh young voices together: "New Days, New Ways,
      Love Stays."
    </p>
    <p>
      The spoken words, deep with meaning, seemed to ring
      reverberatingly for a moment over the old timepiece which
      had seen so many hours fly, and so many flowers die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still facing the old sundial together, Allen slipped an arm
      about Laura and drew her close. "Stay, Laura," he said
      suddenly. "Don't go. Stay and make a home with me . . . as
      they did. After all,--it's best."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a brief moment Laura rested her cheek against Allen's
      arm, felt the touch of something big and beyond her. In
      that fraction of a minute she had the sensation of being
      swept on to some new existence, in which she was greater
      than herself, larger than humanity. The feeling of a great
      contentment came upon her. In that brief space of time she
      seemed to have slipped into her place in the scheme of
      things. It was as though she were the center of all
      existence, the reason for a Great Plan. But she
      straightened and said quickly: "Don't, Allen,--please.
      Don't spoil our last nice hour here. I've told you how I
      feel; I'm just not letting myself in for that sort of
      thing. It isn't what I've planned . . . oh, Allen, try to
      understand me . . . you've been so understanding this last
      year. I've dreamed wonderful things for myself,--you know
      that it's just the spirit of the place that sort of got us
      both for a minute . . . the spirit of the times . . . J.
      Sterling Morton bringing his bride out here and the
      wonderful thing they and all the other young couples did.
      It <i>was</i> wonderful, and it sounds romantic, but that's
      all in the past. And after all, on top of the experiences
      of the other two generations before me, there must be
      something more for me in the world than just a supine
      giving up and keeping house. Why, <i>that's</i> what my
      grandmother did with her meager education and slight
      advantages. Surely there's more for me, now, than just
      that. If <i>that's</i> all, we wouldn't have progressed a
      bit. I've only one life to live, and it must be lived to
      the fullest. Surely there's something more for me than life
      gave my grandmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned earnest brown eyes to him, eyes without banter
      or evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything about all those generalities," Allen
      said stubbornly. "I don't flounder around in a lot of
      philosophies and vague possibilities. All I know is, you're
      the girl I want . . . the most natural . . . and the most
      wonderful thing in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think a lot of you, Allen. Why, you're . . . Allen,
      you're the very best friend I have, but . . .well, this
      will hurt, but it's better to be honest . . . we've always
      been honest, and I think that's been the secret of our good
      friendship . . . but I can't think of anything more prosaic
      than settling down here . . . and sort of letting the world
      go by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't call it letting the world go by," he returned
      quickly. "I call it tackling a small piece of the world,
      and making something of it. You admit Morton and his bride
      and all the rest of the old pioneers did a great thing when
      they crossed the river and started their settlements.
      You've said it was romantic and intensely interesting and
      quite worth while. You think their own love lay at the
      bottom of their acts of courage and bravery. All
      right,--did you ever stop to think that maybe we're
      pioneers, too? Haven't you the vision to see that? Why
      isn't it something of pioneering that I'm trying to do?
      Agriculture in most quarters has been a hard, wearisome
      proposition. People, at large, still think a farmer is the
      same old whiskered type of straw-chewing gent, saying,
      'Wall, I swan,'--that he's always pictured in the cartoons.
      <i>I'm</i> pioneering, too,--and a whole lot of other young
      fellows from the colleges and universities--<i>we</i> have
      visions, too,--a new outlook on the whole thing,--that it's
      a business that can be looked after as thoroughly as any
      other; not the old haphazard type of one-horse farming, but
      the making of every farm into an organized center of
      activities. We've the vision of country homes, as fine and
      ample as any Englishman's estate, and a darned sight more
      convenient,--miniature Arbor Lodges, in a way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw out his hand toward the lovely mansion on the
      terrace above them, its pillars cloud-white against the
      dark green of the ancient trees. It looked peaceful,
      serene, in the warm glow of the late afternoon,--the
      embodiment of strength in a restless time,--the symbol of
      all that is steadfast and durable in a changing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"We're</i> pioneering, too," he went on earnestly, . . .
      "starting a new class . . . the Master Farmers who are
      attempting to develop agriculture to the <i>n</i>th degree.
      Why couldn't you enter into that in the same spirit your
      grandmother did? There are a thousand things to be worked
      out . . . worked out by genuine farmers, and not
      politicians sent down to Washington. Because you're rooted
      in the soil, need you be a nonentity? There's room for
      criticism, I tell you, in an agricultural economy which has
      squeezed out its best youth. Farmers have always been a
      sort of incoherent mass,--their best leadership drained off
      into city life. A scad of sacrifice had been made for this
      state in its early years, and it ought not go for nothing.
      A lot of young fellows with vision and qualities of
      leadership have got to tackle the problem, or we're going
      to have a state of increasing tenantry,--and that
      <i>would</i> ring the bell for agriculture."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he paused, Laura was laughing her throaty contralto
      laugh. "Allen . . . believe <i>me</i> . . . at this rate of
      silver oratory, you'll be in Washington yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right . . ." he grinned, too, a bit sheepishly after
      his tirade, "maybe I will . . . and at that, it wouldn't
      hurt the state to send a dirt farmer either. Well," he
      sobered again, "how about it? I wouldn't ask you to stay
      now, of course--that would be selfish . . . but how about a
      promise that when you come back at Christmas . . . ?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Allen." Laura, too, was sobered and earnest. "There's
      no middle ground for me. If life held marriage for me, I
      would want it to be whole-heartedly so . . . home,
      housekeeping, children. In that, I'm as old-fashioned as
      they make them. Otherwise, it's freedom and more schooling
      and development, and I hope, a career. I'm not going to
      cross life's ideas, make a sort of hybrid of myself, doing
      neither one very well. It just has to be a choice and I've
      decided for the freedom and the career. I feel too
      energetic, and . . . though it's not very good taste to say
      it of myself . . . too talented to embroider fat initials
      on towels and go to housekeeping. To marry and to be
      brought up against all the little irritations of
      housekeeping . . . actually to live with another person . .
      . would injure my dreams. And a writer's life, Allen, is
      just dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said nothing to that, Laura went on: "And then,
      Allen . . . there's something else." She paused and looked
      up at him a bit queerly, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be home Christmas as you say. But not to stay.
      There's more to this visit than I've told you. I'm even
      more tied back there than you know. I just said we'd been
      honest with each other. Well, we have, for that matter. I'm
      not going back on that statement in general. But there is
      one thing I <i>have</i> kept from you, Allen,--not because
      you're not entitled to know, but I've had a sort of
      delicacy about telling you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the quick jealous instinct of the male, Allen divined
      at once. "Somebody else," he said shortly. "Some one East."
      He gave it as a statement rather than a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. That's where you're wrong. I met some men, to be sure,
      but no one to get excited over and write home about. No,
      Allen, something as opposite as it could be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spill it. I'm ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean,--money?"
    </p>

      "Uncle Harry Wentworth's and Aunt Carolyn's money. I'm to
      get it, in time, Allen. Isn't it wonderful? I feel terribly
      humble about it, and you can see for yourself how diffident
      I've felt about people knowing it. Cedartown people! What
      would they think? You know, yourself, how they'd begin to
      look at me differently, as though I were some unusual
      species. Every time I'd turn around it would be
      misinterpreted as some high-hat move. Small towns are funny
      that way. They're far better to any one that's down and out
      than they are to any one riding up on a wave. If I needed
      sympathy, they'd shower me with kind acts. If I had a
      windfall, they'd watch my every action to get a chance to
      take me down a notch or two. It takes a small town to keep
      you humble. So, not anybody knows it but our clan. The
      Deals!" She laughed up at Allen standing silent and grim by
      her. "Rest assured, the Deals have all sat in council upon
      it--have gabbled it all over from A to Z. It isn't any of
      their business, as a matter of fact. The money is going to
      come from my mother's side of the house, as another matter
      of fact. But does that faze the Deals? It does not. At
      every clan gathering they discuss and argue it before my
      face. 'Once a Deal always a Deal' is on our coat of arms, I
      guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen was surprised and a little confused. He could
      scarcely get his bearings. It threw the game into one of
      entirely different tactics. To make love to the little
      Laura Deal he had known,--and then to hear suddenly that
      she was to come into a large amount of money! He stammered
      a little. "Well . . . congratulations. Why . . . that
      sounds . . . great. But what's the big discussion and
      argument?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Laura's turn to be a bit confused. She looked away
      for a moment across the lovely hedges and the green sloping
      lawns. Then she raised honest brown eyes to Allen. "Because
      . . . if I accept their offer . . . I can never marry as
      long as they live. I am to stay with them . . . like a
      daughter . . . unmarried . . . as long as both live . . .
      then the major part of the estate is mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to marry?" Allen said it over, as though speaking it
      aloud might make it more comprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to marry." Laura answered, as though the repetition
      gave it emphasis. "And it's only fair, of course, Allen,"
      she hastened to say. "You see that, don't you? You take two
      people getting on in years that way, and of course they
      would want me to make them that kind of promise, if I
      stayed with them. It's perfectly fair of them. And you can
      see now, what I've been meaning about being free--to follow
      out all the plans I've made for myself. You see it all now,
      don't you, Allen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen was staring down at her. "And you call that 'free'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't," he said hotly. "I call it selling your
      freedom. I call it selling your birthright for a mess of
      pottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flushed, earnest, tense, the two stood facing each other,
      between them the old sundial where the shadow cut its dark
      path across the sunlit stone. A bird dipped down into the
      green thickness of the hedge. A faint odor of the pines
      came from the far side of the grounds and mingled with the
      scent of newly cut clover. From the high terrace above
      them, the pillars of the great house glistened white under
      the blue sky in which a few long feathery clouds sailed, as
      though some of the white columns of the mansion were
      floating off to make dream houses in another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen was the first to speak. He looked at the old sundial
      where the shadow finger was pointing to the fleeting
      moments so stealthily, so noiselessly, that no one could
      detect its measured counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's time to go," he said briefly. And Laura, taken back
      at his lack of response, for a moment felt childishly hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect it is," she said as briefly, and together they
      went down the walk through the garden of dead roses toward
      the graveled road where the parked car stood. The rays of
      the low hanging sun lay with warm mellow light across the
      lovely clipped lawn and hedges. At the west end of the
      Italian garden, Laura, through a swift mist of the eyes,
      looked back at the sundial that had seen so many hours fly
      and so many flowers die. The first part of this August
      afternoon would always stand out in her memory as
      unbelievably happy and peaceful. She had a vague feeling
      that she would always remember it, that she would be able
      to recall it when she was an old, old lady. The hours would
      fly and the flowers would die. She felt unaccountably
      saddened, foolishly homesick. But she had chosen wisely.
      She had kept her head. The emotion which seemed to possess
      her temporarily would leave as soon as she was on the train
      bound for the East. And Allen would recover quickly. Yes,
      for them both there would be new days . . . and new ways.

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Laura found Aunt Grace at the house when she and Allen
      drove up. She had a momentary feeling of irritation that
      Aunt Grace had come. The Deals were clannish, and Laura
      would have defended her aunt to the last ditch before an
      outsider, but to her own self she acknowledged that there
      were times when Aunt Grace's precise English, lack of
      humor, and didactic methods were extremely trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something unusual must have brought Grace down to Cedartown
      on a school night. She was punctilious in her habits, and
      nothing short of a special occasion ever saw her in town at
      any time but a week-end. Added to this, she had already
      bade Laura good-by on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to see you again," she said when Laura had gone
      into the house. "I couldn't bear to let you go without
      another glimpse of you. I'm staying all night and will
      drive back in the morning, in time for my eight o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck Laura as unusual, to say the least. She and Aunt
      Grace had never been very companionable. In fact, she had
      never quite overcome a certain awe of her aunt which had
      persisted from babyhood, an attitude that was not
      materially benefited by having a class under her in the
      University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over and the dishes washed, Laura, still under the
      spell of the afternoon spent with Allen, slipped upstairs
      and into her room, that old haven from countless storms of
      her girlhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite to her surprise and slight annoyance, Aunt Grace
      sought her out. "I wanted to talk to you about something,"
      she said in her precise way when she had settled herself by
      the window. "I thought of it often yesterday and today. And
      so, when my last class was dismissed, I determined to speak
      to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura found her heart thumping a little, and acknowledged a
      vague return of her old childish fear of this aunt and her
      correct ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to speak to you, as I said, about a certain
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura wanted to scream "For heaven's sake--what?" But she
      only said, "Yes--Aunt Grace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're really accepting your Uncle Harry's offer, are
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, Aunt Grace. It's lovely, isn't it?" She spoke in
      a sprightly tone of voice. "I feel like a little Cinderella
      who doesn't quite know how to clean the pumpkin off her
      dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's quite unusual and wonderful. I'm wondering
      though. . . . You're . . . I suppose you think it quite
      without my province . . . and it isn't any of my business,
      Laura, excepting as anything is my business that affects a
      niece of whom I am fond." Of course Aunt Grace would not
      drag in any love stuff. "You're sure you're quite happy and
      sincere about the promise not to marry while the Wentworths
      live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely. But, Aunt Grace, that's kind of funny . . .
      from you, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--it isn't. It isn't at all odd or funny. I'm the
      <i>one</i> to say this to you. I'm the <i>only</i> one
      among the relatives to say this to you." She was speaking
      fast, agitatedly, in sharp contrast to her ordinary
      measured voice. "You're so young to tie yourself to that
      promise . . . I wonder if you know your own mind. I wanted
      to ask you about this young Allen. You've been around with
      him a great deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed a little dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, Aunt Grace, after all those years of experience
      with college people, you're not joining the Village Sewing
      Circle and thinking every girl who is seen with a man is
      going to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--I've grown used to that. I'm just wondering if you
      should tie yourself, though, that way to a promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was provoked. She felt nervous and irritable at the
      turn of the talk, coming so soon after Allen's own
      arraignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no more than any one does when he takes up his life
      work," she spoke quickly. "If I were a little girl, and my
      people were giving me away to Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn
      for their own, there would be some room to talk. I'm not
      'selling myself.' I'm grown, and my own boss, and quite
      capable of deciding. It's no different than your own work,
      Aunt Grace. You teach in the University--you've sold your
      services to the state for the school year. Your summers are
      your own, to teach or go to school or travel. Uncle Harry
      has said I can come home at Christmas time and again in the
      summer if I wish. I'm just as free as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except for that promise you're making them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither is that anything unusual. I am to stay with them
      as long as they live and look after them. Whichever one is
      taken first is assured then that I'm staying with the other
      as long as he or she lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They may live for a great many years, Laura, and become
      helpless and very trying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my risk, of course. But there is plenty of money
      for hiring attendants. I'd only be overseeing things and
      being what I hope would be a comfort to them. If Father and
      Mother were older or sick, my conscience might hurt me, but
      not under these circumstances. Mother is awfully happy
      about it. Father says very little, but neither does he talk
      much about anything, so that's nothing unusual."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace was dubious. "I know my brother, Laura. I don't think
      <i>he</i> is entirely happy about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just at my going away for such long periods. But I
      could be doing that for any other reason. Bernice Fowler's
      sister has gone to Alaska to teach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. And, of course, you're resenting what I've
      said. I can't quite blame you. But I've seen you with this
      young Allen. . . ." There was a distinct air of
      embarrassment about her. ". . . And you've seemed so happy.
      I just wondered . . . if you really knew . . . how happy
      you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was further surprised and not without an
      embarrassment of her own. Whatever had come over this
      icicle of an Aunt?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to tell you . . . I want your life to be happy,
      at all costs. . . ." Evidently she was driving herself to
      speak of that which was painful. "I've had two chances to
      marry . . . one of them doesn't count . . . at least, as
      far as I'm concerned. But the other. . . . Oh, Laura, don't
      make a mistake. Know your own mind, for sure." Laura was
      amazed. She had never before seen her Aunt Grace drop her
      mask of unruffled calm. "He was one of the teachers . . . I
      enjoyed him more than any man I knew . . . but I didn't
      think I cared . . . that way. Later, I knew I cared. I was
      too slow in knowing my own mind . . . too cautious . . .
      too afraid of the sentimental side of life, I guess." She
      was making pitiful little attempts to get control of
      herself. Laura was moved to the depths. If it had been
      anyone else! But Aunt Grace, with her precise
      way,--"prissy" was Katherine's word for it,--it seemed
      unbelievable that she had known this romantic experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother never knew that I regretted my decision. I couldn't
      add it to her troubles, so I kept it to myself. She would
      have suffered with me. She always wanted to see me in a
      home of my own. She had the old-fashioned notion that it
      was the most satisfactory life. Well, at that, I guess she
      was right,--providing, of course, that home can be all that
      it should. And it would have been,--oh, it <i>would</i>
      have been." Her face was red and contorted in its distress.
      Laura wished nothing so much as that the painful interview
      might end. "He was fine in everyway. I should have known my
      own mind, sooner. Mother was right. She tried to tell me. I
      never told her how I came to feel, and I never told any
      one." She was speaking fast, catching her breath quickly to
      cover her emotion. "I don't know what was the matter with
      me." She rose and walked over to the windows, fingering the
      draped curtain nervously. "Oh, I can have a home of my own
      . . ." she explained apologetically, "every capable woman
      can. But it will never be just what that one might have
      been. So you see, Laura," she was gaining her composure,
      "it's because I . . . am fond of you that I'm telling you .
      . . because I don't want to see you make the mistake I did
      . . . if mistake it <i>is</i> you will be making . . . that
      is something no one but you can know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was calm again, quite unruffled. The waters from the
      depths of her being had moved in and up, with some vagrant
      tide of emotion. And now they had receded. And there was
      nothing to disturb the serenity of the surface.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn the birds outside Laura's window woke her. A
      woodpecker was beating a monotonous tom-tom on some hollow
      drum of a tree, and a rain-crow called. With returning
      consciousness, the thought that this was the last full day
      at home sprang nimbly to the foreground. For a time she lay
      and thought of many things: that Allen's personality had
      developed into something finer than mere
      attractiveness,--that life was like a forest in which one
      walked blindly,--that good judgment, like a forest ranger,
      watched for the earliest sign of smoke and flame--And then,
      suddenly, the simile weakened and had no meaning, for it
      occurred to her that the lookout can only give the alarm.
      By no means is he expected to reduce the conflagration,
      alone and single handed. There was something so disquieting
      about the thought that she rose, threw a robe across her
      shoulders, and sat by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was stirring. It was Aunt Grace, up early in order
      to get back to school on time. She felt a sudden tenderness
      for her, a definite pity that she had experienced a
      disappointment in life, all the more keen, perhaps, because
      it had been of her own making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Grace had said that no one was to get up when she did,
      that she would slip out very early. But hearing her moving
      about that way, gave Laura a sense of compassion, a desire
      to do something for this aunt whom she had never really
      known. What a good woman she was,--so conscientious and
      faithful to her duties. So she, too, dressed and slipped
      down to make toast and coffee for her. Through the kitchen
      windows, as she worked, she could see old Oscar in his
      garden, walking through the rows of cabbages and selecting
      one or two with the dew still fresh upon them. "I can
      foresee that our family or Kathie's or some of the other
      neighbors will have cabbage presented to them to-day." She
      smiled to herself at the old man's habit. "He's
      vegetable-conscious," she thought, and told herself she
      must repeat that to Allen to make him smile. She loved
      making the corners of his mouth draw up in that cheerful
      grin. This made her think of that particular young man
      again, which brought her around in a circle to the point
      where the morning's thoughts had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Grace came down then, a little neat overnight bag in
      her hand. She was surprised, and evidently a bit touched at
      the early attention from Laura. The two ate together, but
      with no great degree of ease. They were both conscious of
      the intimate talk of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise came down, energetic and capable, with much
      criticism of the slight breakfast: "Laura, you should have
      made cocoa. Your Aunt Grace likes cocoa. Did you measure
      the coffee? The toast, Laura,--oh, surely you didn't use
      the bread in the white square box. The bread in the round
      green box is always for toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      John came down. "You're going to have a hot day for your
      last one, I'm afraid, Laura."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trib came lumbering down, looking sleepy and a little
      watery as to the sides of his dark hair. "Wish I could
      pound my ear once 'til noon," he was growling.
    </p>
    <p>
      How common and natural everything was,--the day starting
      like a hundred other days, with duties and ordinary events.
      And yet, it was not an ordinary day at all. It was the last
      one to be spent at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Grace was leaving. They all stood in the driveway with
      her. She brushed a little dust off the windshield of her
      coup. She hoped she hadn't put them all out, getting them
      up early. She would be very pleased to have a letter from
      Laura, any time she felt like writing. She looked at her
      wrist watch. She must start in order to have plenty of
      time. She thought the day was going to be rather trying.
      She shook Laura's hand stiffly and wished her a pleasant
      and safe journey. She slipped driving-gloves on her
      immaculate hands, the brown cuffs coming well over the
      white of her sleeves. And she was off to her daily war upon
      split infinitives and double negatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking after her a moment, Laura had another feeling of
      tenderness toward her. How we live our lives side by side
      with those whom we never know or understand. Some day she
      would like to write about Aunt Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and was about to slip her arm through her
      mother's in a moment of deep feeling, but already Eloise
      was stepping briskly up on the back porch. "Now, Laura, we
      must systematize everything to-day. The packing, the work,
      the last calls to make. I always say, the way to accomplish
      anything is to organize and then concentrate on the--" Her
      voice died away in the interior of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several moments Laura stood on the back steps looking
      out over the low rolling hills to the east. There was an
      opening between the neighbors' houses and the trees where
      one could see, as in a dark frame, a section of the rich
      rolling farm land under the yellow morning sun. Then she,
      too, turned and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day there were necessary tasks to do. The phone rang
      often and friends dropped in to say good-by. Old Oscar Lutz
      brought a cabbage and some onions in the battered pail with
      rope for a handle. Eloise was provoked. "Imagine it!
      <i>Onions</i> for you, Laura."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathie called and asked Laura to come there for dinner at
      six. She was having Allen too, and to pay for their meal,
      she informed Laura laughingly, Laura and Allen were to
      drive Jimmie over to Meadowdale to catch the evening train.
      Yes, Patty was fine and wanted to see Lolly. All day Laura
      moved in a half daze. It did not seem possible that she was
      leaving for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all day John Deal worked at his desk in the office back
      of the bank. Not until he closed the desk did he realize
      how tired he was. The day had been particularly trying. He
      had been attempting to work on the Statler case, a suit for
      damages. Old Oscar Lutz had taken up an hour or more with a
      minute change in his will, and an incredible number of
      reminiscences. And as a climax, the warring factions of the
      Neidlemann family had descended upon him, with long drawn
      out recitals of their respective grievances which consisted
      for the most part of such important injuries as the
      unwarranted removal of a chicken brooder and the
      unauthorized disposal of an old bucksaw. A country town
      lawyer's greatest trial is the inability to get rid of
      clients with any degree of speed. To hire a lawyer in a
      small town is to hire him body and soul, to compel him to
      listen to all the minutiae of all the experiences, physical
      and mental, that have attached themselves to said client or
      all the relatives, both blood and law, of said client.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, as John Deal closed the office door, the words of
      the old poem came to him:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "And the cares that infest the day<br>
      Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,<br>
      And as silently steal away."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He wished it were possible that they would do so. But he
      could not shake them off. They rode home on his shoulder,
      like so many little red devils. He had always been that
      way. He guessed he took life too seriously. Other men
      seemed to be able to leave their business cares behind them
      like lizards' skins. Mack, for one. Mack had made lots of
      money and apparently more easily than he himself had made a
      mere living; was not tied down to it especially,
      either,--did a great many social things in Omaha, played
      golf, was a good mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His jaw set as he thought of the arguments he had staged
      with Mack. Bull-headed, Mack was. Mack had started out on
      that guarantee law fight with only his own interests at
      heart. Had hidden behind that word "confiscatory" every
      time the matter was discussed, like a kid behind his
      mother's skirts. Confiscatory! He had heard that word so
      much he wished he might never hear it again. Let the
      bankers pay. Let them pay and pay until it hurt. They would
      yelp at every assessment, but it was no harder on them than
      the calamities of those poor people who had lost
      everything. To be sure, the fight for the old law was over,
      the fund was insolvent and the law repealed. But there was
      that other obligation, that gradual liquidation of the
      fund, the back assessments and the future assessments. The
      supreme court had decided for the state against the
      bankers. And still the bankers refused to pay and had
      started another suit. It would work a great hardship on the
      banks, they said. To be sure it would. So was it working a
      great hardship on old Mr. and Mrs. Kleinman to lose their
      life savings; so was it a great hardship on Amy Hall, the
      little seamstress, to lose all she had; on young Mrs. Wise
      and her babies, to see their insurance money swept away.
      And yet,--
    </p>
    <p>
      In his trained way of looking at both sides of a question
      without prejudice, he made himself again look the other
      side of the issue squarely in the face. The assessments had
      called for an immense sum from the state banks,--millions.
      Thirty-six thousand dollars from the Cedartown bank alone
      had been paid out since the weak banks started
      going,--probably over a half million from Mack's bank in
      Omaha. Should they pay longer? The depression had taken its
      toll in withdrawn deposits, in slumping of land values, in
      losses on bond investments and in individuals' failure to
      pay obligations. Was it true, as Mack insisted, that the
      whole state system would be badly weakened, as a bridge
      would weaken if a portion of the bolts were removed?
      Perhaps he, himself, had been wrong. Good bankers ought not
      pay the debts of the poor ones. Perhaps the lesser evil was
      the individuals' losses. His mind went back again to old
      Mr. and Mrs. Kleinman, to Amy Hall, to young Mrs. Wise. It
      was for them,--and their kind,--he had fought so hard. And
      to what end? It made him feel very old and very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned the corner on his home street, the thoughts of
      his business cares were suddenly forgotten in remembering
      that it was tomorrow morning that Laura was leaving. It
      gave him a sudden stab of regret like a physical pain. He
      wished she wouldn't go so far away, and especially under
      those circumstances. He wondered if she knew her own mind,
      that she was virtually selling her youth to the old couple.
      It was tempting, he realized,--but ten years from now Laura
      would be in her thirties, the first fine flush of youth
      over. Eloise thought it quite wonderful. That was to be
      expected. Eloise had always counted success in dollars and
      cents. He had not pleased her in that way, he knew. She had
      not particularly nagged him about it in so many words, but
      he had learned to translate the straight set line to her
      mouth, when fees were discussed. And this move of Laura's
      meant success in both her own and her mother's minds, he
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not sure he liked the plan. He wished he had talked
      more to Laura about it. Had always found it difficult to
      express himself to the children. Something about the whole
      thing seemed like turning your back on your own people and
      your own Midwest. That last was all sentiment, of course.
      Because one was born in Nebraska was no reason he had to
      take root and grow there. But even as he refuted it, he
      vaguely knew that he had a brooding love for it. There was
      something of the old raw prairie in his blood, a little of
      the stubborn old buffalo in his sinews. It was as though
      having been born near the sod and under the northwest
      winds, companioned by the prairie grasses, and wakened from
      sleep by the prairie-lark, this was the only home he could
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Rinemiller had told him once he felt the same way, as
      though the very loam and skies and winds were different. He
      liked the young fellow. Going to make good, too. Had a fine
      start from the old Reinmueller holdings, and with his
      technical knowledge, he would make a big estate out of the
      old farms. Had a notion that Laura liked him pretty well.
      She had certainly been around with him enough, but that
      didn't mean anything these days. Joke and laugh and make
      love and ride away seemed to be the general trend of the
      times. Well, Laura ought to know her own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went up the steps at home, the sight of Laura's
      steamer trunk in the hall and an open bag on it, gave him a
      heaviness of heart that he could not throw off. He felt
      depressed--and very worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are Mamma and Laura?" he asked Trib who, legs over
      the arm of a big chair, was devouring an apple and the
      contents of a movie magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise came in at the moment. She was flushed and warm.
      "I'm all ready," she said, "Katherine sent for Laura to
      come to dinner. She thought she ought not to go on account
      of it being her last night. But Katherine insisted."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three ate supper. It was hot and sultry, so that
      immediately afterward, John went out on the front porch
      with the evening paper. The sun was dropping in the west
      and low sullen clouds like gray smoke hung along the
      southwest horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz came thump-thumping around his house,
      stopped to speak to John about the warm day and the promise
      of rain, recalled other Augusts with his everlasting "I
      mind as how" and thump-thumped on up the street for his
      evening walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He goes to the cemetery so often," Eloise said, with a
      sudden unexpected touch of tenderness in her voice. "Funny
      old codger. No one could ever say he forgot his old
      'Marthy.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trib went out on his bicycle. Eloise repacked part of
      Laura's bag. John read here and there. But the paper did
      not seem to interest him. He was thinking of Laura when she
      was little, remembering how happy she always was out at
      Mother's. He let the paper fall in his lap and his mind
      linger on his mother. What a combination she had been of
      strength and tenderness, of courage and love. He believed
      he'd walk out past the old place. Hadn't been out that way
      for a long time. Had a distinct longing to see it to-night.
      He called to Eloise that he would be back in an hour or
      less and started out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived out there, he was almost sorry he had come. The
      empty old house looked more decayed and tumble-down than he
      had remembered. It gave him a feeling of depression and
      pain to see the place that had once meant so much to his
      mother, looking forlorn in the glow of the late afternoon
      sun. Young Rinemiller owned it now,--had said it was the
      best building site in the county, and that if he ever
      built, he was going to tear down the old house and built
      right there on the same spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foolish notion,--but he couldn't help but wish something
      had come of that affair of Allen and Laura. Fine young
      chap, and Laura would be right here--
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke away from the thought of the vague desire almost
      with embarrassment, as though he had spoken it aloud. For
      Allen Rinemiller's roadster was coming up the street, and
      the people in it were waving to him. It was Allen and Laura
      and Jimmie Buchanan. He wondered where they were going.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="c23" id="c23">CHAPTER 23</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was not quite five-thirty when Laura went down to
      Kathie's. She was fresh and dainty in creamy white, an
      ensemble in which she was at her best, for the pale olive
      of her skin, her shining brown eyes and soft brown hair
      were thrown into lovely relief by the very lack of coloring
      in the costume. As she walked, her thoughts skipped about,
      quite like children at play, with no special objective. She
      thought of the physical ease that life would bring her at
      Uncle Harry's and of the long free hours in which she could
      scribble to her heart's content. She thought of her youth,
      and how true it was that a young person's eyes were always
      on the future. That made her think of old Oscar Lutz in
      contrast, whose thoughts were always with the days that
      were gone. Age and youth! Her father, then, must be at the
      stage where one thought only of the day's work,--the
      present. She would not like that age very well, she
      decided,--the time when one looked neither hopefully
      forward nor longingly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought how pretty Kathie's house looked down the
      street, in its trim lawn with the white hydrangeas massed
      against the reddish-brown of the brick. Allen had said it
      was the kind of house he wanted to build--At that, she
      concentrated on the vision of Uncle Harry, and was annoyed
      that she could think of him only in his most exasperating
      moments of see-sawing nervously up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl was coming up the street. It was Verna Conden. She,
      too, was in white,--a pretty girl, if she only had some
      grooming. Her hair was dry and rough, on her cheeks two
      vivid spots as round as dollars, her generous mouth
      outlined heavily in scarlet. She passed Laura with a brief
      "Hello," her eyes straight ahead. It annoyed Laura, but
      there was nothing she could do about it. Verna had always
      acted that way. She probably still cared for Allen. Life
      was a strange mixup. The thought troubled her a little, so
      that when she went into Kathie's she had not thrown it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that high-handed manner for which she was known among
      friends and relatives, Kathie immediately poked her finger
      into the sore spot even before they had moved out of the
      hall:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lolly . . . you're unhappy about something. I can see
      through you like tissue paper. Look me in the eye. Tell me
      . . . is it about Allen Rinemiller?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura flushed and evaded Katherine's bright all-seeing eyes
      for the space of a moment, and then she spoke with
      composure. "Since you've asked, Kathie, I can tell you that
      it's not the pleasantest thing in the world to hurt as fine
      a fellow as Allen. We've been friends for a long time . . .
      and I'm terribly sorry he's grown to . . ." she faced her
      cousin ". . . care." They had moved into the living room.
      Laura sat a little stiffly in a big chair. Kathie curled up
      on the davenport.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about you, yourself? Katherine was not one to
      stand on the ceremony of polite evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I . . . you mean me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite naturally, when I said, 'What about you, yourself,'
      I meant you. Looks suspiciously to me, Lolly, that you were
      stalling for time to get a neat little well-bred answer
      ready for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I wasn't. I'll answer you, but it's awfully hard
      to define the way I feel. I really don't think you'd
      understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'd understand, all right." Katherine grinned
      cheerfully. "I'm not such a nit-wit at times. I've even
      been known to see through a sorority roommate of mine who
      was marrying a man for his money . . . a match her dear
      mother made for her . . . and how that girl did talk
      against time to make us think she was crazy about Louie.
      She called attention to his honesty and his ability and his
      nose and the shape of his feet and his blue blood and his
      energy and what-have-you, and all the time, I was dying to
      quote that smart old Billy Shakespeare who was just as
      wordy as she was: 'Methinks the lady doth protest too
      much.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed. "Oh Kathie, you're the limit. Whatever has
      that got to do with me? If . . . just <i>if</i> . . .
      assuming that I <i>would</i> marry Allen . . . instead of
      <i>for</i> money, it would be I who would be giving up
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole point being, my dear Miss Deal . . . and
      <i>misdeal</i> it might be, Laura . . . don't forget your
      unfortunate, unlucky name. Anybody's who's handed that Miss
      Deal for a name ought to change it . . . that's why I did.
      The point is, that if I had the wit to see through my
      roommate, who was marrying for no reason <i>but</i> money,
      wouldn't it follow, inversely, that I had the wit to see
      through a girl who was <i>not</i> marrying . . . all on
      account of money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's unfair, Kathie,--perfectly unjust. Money or no
      money, I'd think of my own best good. I've settled it quite
      definitely in my mind that I'm going to bend all my
      energies toward making something of myself in the writing
      line. I think I inherited this little talent . . . if
      talent it is . . . from Grandmother Deal. She used to talk
      to me about it. She wished so much she could have written .
      . . she'd say 'Some day you'll write for me, Laura.' And
      I'm going to. I feel it in me." She wanted to tell Kathie
      about "a white bird flying," but it would sound silly and
      sentimental to Kathie, she knew. Kathie would only make
      some wisecrack about putting salt on its tail. "I say, you
      can't serve two masters. If you want to be any good at
      something, you'd better just cut out everything else.
      That's why I said I thought you couldn't understand. I do
      like Allen. I like him immensely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you do love him?" Katherine looked with level blue eyes
      into the brown ones of the younger girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't say so," Laura insisted. "I said I <i>liked</i>
      him. I like him better than any man I know. I'll go farther
      . . . since you're putting me through an examination . . .
      I'll say maybe I'd love him if I'd let myself go. I don't
      know. But I just won't do that. Ever since I was a
      youngster, I've been deliberately holding myself to this
      one thought,--that of accomplishing something worth while.
      And I'd be absolutely crazy to throw away Uncle Harry's
      offer. I told Allen once I wasn't going to be a hybrid,--a
      sort of cross between two desires in life, amounting to
      nothing much in either. Apparently I'm keeping my head as I
      choose. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you ask me, I'll say that if you love him, you're a
      little coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a strong word, Katherine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! She called me Katherine. She's getting dignified and
      mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Laura, unheeding, went on immediately: "A coward being,
      as I supposed, some one who is cravenly afraid, I ask you
      what I've given you reason to think I'm afraid of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much," Katherine said coolly. "Nothing but life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good. That's awfully good." Laura's olive cheeks
      were flushed to the forehead, and she was sitting on the
      edge of her chair. "Why, it's life I'm starting out to see.
      It's life I'm starting out to study . . . to feel . . . to
      know. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To smell. You've left out one sense, Lolly," Katherine
      laughed gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Laura would not laugh. She went on earnestly: "I'm
      going East. I'm going to do the thing Grandmother had a
      chance to do and didn't take her chance. I'm going to see
      life, and I'm going to write about it. And nothing you can
      say will change me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Lolly. Let's not fly at each other's throats.
      Go on . . . go on East . . . it'll be lovely. In time,
      you'll have gobs of money . . . and if your slippery Uncle
      Harry Wentworth and his fat frau don't hang on until your
      arteries harden, you'll enjoy it mightily. It's none of my
      business, honey. And anyway, I must see about the dinner.
      Verna struck . . . just walked out on me. Said she had a
      headache, but I noticed she was as gay as a chorus girl
      until I mentioned my guests."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and moved toward the dining room. At the door she
      stuck her head back in the room. "When you go East," she
      was smiling mischievously, "be sure you take all your
      baggage . . . dresses, shoes, hats, undies, pocket-book,
      toothbrush, heart,--everything . . . don't forget your
      heart, Lolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went off toward the kitchen with one of her high
      merry laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie came home, the fatigue of the hot day and the
      wrestle with various business problems showing a bit in the
      lines around his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen came only a few moments later. He was tanned, but he
      looked immaculate and well-groomed in his summer flannels.
      He had not seen Patty since her illness and at Katherine's
      suggestion, he and Laura went with her upstairs to see the
      little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patty was sitting up in bed with several pillows behind her
      back, and a village of cardboard houses roaming up and down
      over pink coverlet hills in front of her. The nurse went
      down for the supper tray as soon as the group came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Miss Buchanan?" Allen sat down on the edge of
      the bed, and immediately the two were engaged in a guessing
      game in which Allen, shrunken to two inches in height, was
      supposed to be hiding behind one of the houses from which
      he was to be dragged by a pygmy Patty of one inch. How nice
      Allen was with children, Laura thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the nurse and tray appeared and the three were
      leaving, Patty's squeals of laughter over the miniature
      hide-and-seek game changed to pouting and a suggestion of
      tears. Katherine plead with her small daughter to be a
      little lady, the nurse painted the description of the
      supper tray in glowing colors, and Laura promised a story
      when the tray was cleared. Even then, it was Allen who
      brought back the sunshine with his watch on Patty's own
      dainty wrist, the band making two trips around before it
      was fastened. Yes, Allen was nice with children, Laura
      admitted it again. People always said that if a man was
      nice to old people and children--Laura hurriedly returned a
      group of little thoughts back to the portion of her mind
      from which they had come, as one would shoo a flock of
      chickens back to their coop. Thoughts must not get out that
      way and run unheeded all over the nice clipped lawn of her
      mind. But it was true that every one liked Allen,--young
      and old, she was thinking as they went downstairs to the
      dinner table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was not an unqualified success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie was pleasant but tired, and was having to leave as
      soon as they would finish. Allen, unaccountably for him,
      was quiet. He seemed to have lost his gay banter, and with
      it, the ease he usually possessed. He was preoccupied,
      roused himself with an effort to take his part in the
      conversation. Laura, too, was quiet and apparently
      incapable of any small chatter. So many big things were
      happening to her that all the little gay things of life
      seemed inadequate, not worth noticing. Katherine did the
      best she could with her usual nonsense, succeeding in
      getting them to laugh a time or two. But for the most part,
      the little foursome was merely a matter of gastronomics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was scarcely finished until Jimmie was getting his
      bag to leave, in order to catch the through train at
      Meadowdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that Allen and Laura, sitting in the car,
      waiting a moment for Jimmie to come out, were quite without
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When through the front door Laura caught a glimpse of
      Katherine's and Jimmie's farewell, it recalled to her the
      narrow escape in the little household. She wished she could
      tell Allen all about it. Allen was always so understanding.
      But the near tragedy had happened to a Deal, and the Deals
      were too clannish to betray each other's confidence. There
      was something queer about Allen to-night, anyway. He seemed
      quiet, constrained, a little stiff. He had no gay
      inconsequential chatter, and no laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting between the two men as the roadster headed north,
      Laura thought that they were, without doubt, two of the
      finest men she knew. And something alike too, when one
      stopped to think about it,--clean, straight-shooting,
      dependable. Yes, that was the word she decided that fitted
      them both,--utterly and unequivocably dependable. She felt
      terribly sorry for Allen. It was no small thing to hurt a
      man like that. She would make it up to him as much as she
      could with letters. She would write him gay interesting
      letters,--letters that would bring that cheerful grin to
      his lips, and the crinkling laughter to his eyes. And
      Christmas . . . when she came home . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      There was her father, sauntering along in the northeast end
      of town. She wondered what he was doing out here. A warm
      feeling of tenderness toward him came over her, and a touch
      of anxiety. To see him walking along in that leisurely
      fashion so contrary to his usual brisk pace, gave her a
      momentary thought that some day he would be like old Oscar
      Lutz, thumping along the sidewalks with a cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned to the west and again to the north on the main
      highway. They were passing the west end of the cemetery
      now. Thinking of Old Oscar, there he was now, leaning on
      his cane and looking over toward the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waved him a friendly salute, but he did not seem to
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He probably can't see well any more," Laura explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you suppose it seems like, Allen"--it was Jimmie
      Buchanan--"to be approaching the end of a lifetime of that
      length?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord,--I don't know. It seems rather terrible to me to
      think about it at all . . . feeble and dull and all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all your emotions dead . . . hope and love and your
      dreams all done for. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so . . . hope and love and your dreams all done for
      . . . nothing left." Allen's voice sounded dull and flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of being lonely like that . . . no matter how many
      people are around you . . . lonely in spirit, not being
      able to recall what happened yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not being able to recall what happened yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura glanced up at him quickly, but Allen was merely
      repeating it, parrot-like, as though he had no real idea of
      what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car shot on toward the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're forgetting one thing," Laura said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" It was Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're forgetting memories," she said. "Old Oscar Lutz has
      his memories left."
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="c24" id="c24">CHAPTER 24</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz, bent, and as wrinkled as one of the walnuts
      under his ancient trees, had trudged sturdily along in the
      early evening, his cane tap-tapping on the cement. At the
      end of the walk by the cemetery he had stopped and leaned
      for a while on the heavy gnarled stick. From under his
      shaggy white eyebrows he gazed long and lovingly at the
      prairie landscape, with the sun slipping down behind the
      green rolling hills. The graveled highway like a tawny path
      through a sea of green, stretched as far away as his
      blurred old eyes could see. As he stood there wrinkling his
      eyelids, squinting to see the farther, a long green
      roadster shot by to the north. People in it waved their
      hands to him, but his slow moving thoughts had not been
      able to send their message speedily enough to his own
      calloused old hands, and the car was far in the distance
      before he could collect himself to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking after it helplessly. It made him feel
      stupid in the face of such speed. He had recognized the
      car, though, as Allen Rinemiller's. He was proud of that.
      Eyesight was pretty good, yet, he bragged to himself. That
      would probably be Laura Deal with Allen. Nice little girl.
      And nice boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts turned to Allen who was farming his own old
      place now. Queer, to think of some one else farming the old
      land whose virgin sod he himself had turned so many decades
      ago. He looked over into the pasture and longed suddenly to
      feel again the sponginess of the ground under his feet, the
      velvet of the lush green grass. Cement,--how it tired your
      feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the slow hesitating ways of the very old, he stood for
      some time trying to decide whether he should make the
      attempt to get through the fence and over into the pasture.
      Then he caught a strand of the barbed-wire in the hook of
      his cane, and with slow painful movements, his hat dropping
      in the grass and his long white scarf catching on a barb,
      he pushed through the wire into the pasture,--formerly his
      own farm land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retrieving his ancient headgear, he walked slowly,
      laboriously on through the green growth, his cane flicking
      the jimson and milkweed. Here was the very spot where his
      house had stood. How many years had it been torn down?
      Twenty . . . thirty? Oh, well, what was the use of trying
      to figure it all out? Whatever the number of years, it
      seemed like yesterday that it stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked over the lumpy ground flipping his cane about,
      trying to find some old landmark of the house yard. There
      was nothing left but a few flat stones in a pile over which
      the wild morning-glories were sprawling. Those stones had
      been hauled from Weeping Water,--ten miles,--a full day's
      trip. He had hauled them with oxen; old Roxy and Roll, the
      brass buttons on their horns glistening in the sunshine as
      they swayed their huge heads from side to side. All day it
      had taken; and now the youngsters piled in cars evenings
      and, bareheaded, drove down to the picture shows in Weeping
      Water in a few minutes. Somebody ought to tell the
      youngsters about the way it used to be, make them
      appreciate the times in which they lived. But nobody ever
      seemed to remember or care. Everybody taken up with his own
      affairs. Who would there be left in the community to tell
      them about the old days when he was gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah Lutz was dead now and Christine had no mind, and he
      alone was left, the last of the group that came into the
      country when there was nothing but virgin prairie. He tried
      to tell folks about it. Sometimes they listened, but more
      times they seemed unheeding. Did any one care about those
      old days? Apparently not. But how could a group of people
      do what he and the Deals and Reinmuellers had done,--come
      in their prairie schooners to the wild prairie, dig their
      very homes out of the ground, brave the storms and the
      droughts and the blizzards and all the wild ways of the raw
      new country, establish the community,--and be ignored? How
      could they do it,--and be forgotten forever?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rusty piece of iron. He pushed it over with his
      cane,--a part of the pump. A piece of a rusty pump and a
      pile of stones,--all that was left of the place he and
      Marthy had called home. <i>Home.</i> What a big word that
      was. Lots of attempts made lately to belittle it. Plenty of
      fun poked at it. Young folks laughed about it,--called it a
      place to park. Everybody wanted to get some place else,
      seemed like. They'd find out. They'd understand some day.
      When they got old, they'd know. They'd want to go home.
      Sometime in their lives, everybody wanted to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked over to the low green hill where the mighty
      cottonwood still stood. Marthy used to say she didn't like
      cottonwoods,--they looked lonely and homesick-like. But he
      liked them. They were the settlers' first friends, and he
      would never go back on a friend. Their little shining
      leaves twinkled merrily all day long,--shimmered when
      everything else was still. Happy sort of trees they were.
      Only trees he knew that liked to laugh and joke. The leaves
      were not stirring now. That was because the breeze had died
      down and there were low threatening clouds hanging in the
      far southwest. Going to rain. It would be midnight before
      they got the shower though. Good thing,--keep the pastures
      green for the stock as they were now,--not like some of
      those old summers when the corn baked on the roots and the
      fruit died in the blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the incline he toiled, digging his cane in the ground to
      help him ascend. He was out of breath. At the top of the
      little hill, he leaned against the tree, his bent, gaunt
      body dwarfed by the size of the massive trunk. He laid a
      trembling hand against the bark,--one was as gnarled as the
      other. He had a warm friendly feeling for the old tree, as
      though having been planted by him, it was born of his flesh
      and blood; as though having come up through the years with
      him, it was one of the old crowd. He and the old
      cottonwood,--the only two old settlers left. All of the old
      cottonwoods had been replaced by newer trees,--all of the
      old settlers replaced by younger men.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the rise of ground, he could look off in every
      direction. To the north and east and west were prosperous
      farms, with their huge barns and silos and granaries. To
      the south lay the town, looking quiet and peaceful under
      the pink light of the waning day, its great trees
      apparently massed in one huge bouquet of green, spires of
      churches piercing through it. Not far from where he stood,
      motor cars purred swiftly along the graveled road.
      Following the highway, a huge powerline sent its
      electricity to the farms and into town. Telephone poles
      stood on duty, conveying messages from the town to farm and
      farm to town. What a change since the days of the oxen and
      the soddie.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time he stood, trying to call up the picture of the
      same view as it had been from this identical hill in those
      days. He could vision only an ocean of grass, here and
      there a hut of a settler and a few cattle herded on the
      prairie. With the dim picture came a sudden "feel" of
      youth. For a minute the sluggish blood within him stirred,
      so that in fancy he felt a touch of reality in the memory,
      as though for a short period the dim picture brightened and
      hung there colorfully before him. The brief moment of
      vividness made him feel that the old days were best. But
      immediately, his good sense told him the feeling seemed
      true only because he had been young. And youth is best.
      These were the best days, now, for all who were young. The
      old days here in the state had been the foundation
      days,--days of digging and delving and laying the stones
      for the structure. Lots of hard work. Lots of sacrifice.
      Primitive ways. Crude methods. Lots of sorrow. Three little
      girls dying. No anti-toxin. No knowledge of tuberculosis
      treatment. No hospitals. Everything changed now for the
      better. Folks would be surprised--some day--when his will
      would be read--two grandsons in California would get their
      father's share, all right, but what would have been for the
      three little girls was going to be a hospital for
      Cedartown. Nobody but John Deal knew. <i>Martha Lutz
      Memorial Hospital.</i> Place where they'd know about
      anti-toxin and operations and tubercular treatment for
      other little girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he walked around the summit of the knoll and looked
      at the creek bed beyond. It looked inviting,--seemed more
      like the old place than any other part of the farm. Allen,
      with his smart up-to-date farming, had changed everything
      around now. Only the old pasture and the creek bed gave
      back their memories. Only the lush green grass and the
      winding timber were familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half aware of the foolishness of the venture, he walked on
      down the slope of the hill to the creek bed. It seemed
      homelike down there--friendly. He had not dreamed that the
      creek bed would show so little change. Always before, in
      recalling the old scenes, he had been obliged to imagine
      half of the picture, but here he seemed absolutely back in
      the past. It gave him the happiest sensation he had known
      for years. Wild plum and thorn-apples, little scrub oaks
      and soft maples, misshapen elms and willows attempted to
      shoulder each other out of the way, as though all were
      trying to get down to the low running water. Wild
      grape-vines tangled and festooned themselves from tree to
      tree. There were declivities here, faint indentations
      marking the spots of old buffalo wallows. Familiar looking
      muskrat slides confronted him. He followed slowly and
      doggedly the turns of the vagrant creek, a warm feeling of
      pleasure growing upon him, half aware that he should go
      back, but losing himself in the "feel" of the atmosphere.
      Why, gosh all hemlock,--this time, he was not just
      remembering the old days. He was <i>living</i> them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, he knew that by comparison all his memories of
      the past had been dim, befogged by the years in between.
      But this was different. This was as clear as crystal. He
      could think of the house back there now just as plain as
      could be. He leaned on his cane, and looked back toward the
      hill which would have hidden it from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to now, this memory had been blurred a little, as though
      the old house were seen dimly through a curtain. Now it
      stood out in all its clearness. Every window, every
      shingle, every clapboard took upon itself form and clarity.
      Just over the hill out of sight it would be standing. He
      visualized the sloping roof,--he had built it steep so the
      great prairie snows would not pack on it. Queer how the
      country had changed,--very little snow last winter, they
      told him. And in the old days, the great blizzards half
      buried the house and stables all winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind turned the scene to summer, and he recalled the
      kitchen door with the vines over it. Marthy was great on
      flowers and vines. One year when nothing else would grow,
      she planted a squash. It grew all over the back of the
      kitchen, and he had to get boards to brace up the heavy
      Hubbards pulling down on the vine. He could see, in fancy,
      the two little kitchen windows a few feet apart. Marthy
      used to set her pies in them to cool--pumpkin or wild
      gooseberry or wild crabapple. Nobody could make pies like
      Marthy. He almost chuckled aloud at the memory of the time
      he had come up the draw, tiptoed to the window, hooked one
      of the pies, eaten part of it and hidden the rest, and let
      Marthy scold and wonder about it. When she accused Shep he
      confessed, and Marthy boxed his ears. Couldn't let old Shep
      be scolded. He hadn't thought of old shaggy Shep for years.
      Used to go after the cows with him--chase little yellow
      butterflies--bring him foolish little things in his mouth
      and lay them at his feet. Wanted a younger dog when the old
      fellow got so he wasn't much good--gave him to a young
      couple over beyond the Weeping Water. One cold night heard
      a scratching on the door and there was Shep,--legged it
      home all the fourteen miles--standing there looking up,
      wagging his tail, and had a piece of dried tumble-weed in
      his mouth for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beat all, how well he could remember things tonight. It was
      being down here on the old stamping ground, that accounted
      for it. He had a pleasant sensation of knowing what to do
      after this when time hung heavily on his hands. Come down
      into the draw, where the wild grape-vines tangled in the
      underbrush and the old buffalo wallows and the muskrat
      slides looked familiar. It made things all clear, again. It
      took away the dimness of the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, old Oscar Lutz had his memories left.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked back to the creek bed again. Suddenly
      he wondered if he could still pick out the spot where the
      four families had camped those first nights on the prairie.
      He plodded along, following the bend of the creek,
      remembering how the four wagons had trailed along behind
      each other, . . . forded the creek bed about . . . There! .
      . . about there . . . where that clump of elderberries
      stood. He felt excited, the long forgotten sensation of
      warm blood stirring again through his veins. They had gone
      over this way a little . . . there . . . about there was
      the campfire. Well . . . snappin' crocodiles! . . . there
      was the old black burned-out remnants of the campfire right
      now. Suddenly he felt foolish. The kids came down here
      often . . . Boy Scouts and the like. It would be their
      burned-out campfire. But, for a minute, it had him fooled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He poked at the black remnants of wood with his cane, and
      thought of the wagons trailing over the prairie,--his own
      with Marthy and the little girls, Will and Abbie Deal's
      with little Mack . . . Mack was a big banker now in Omaha .
      . . Henry and Sarah, the bride . . . lively Sarah with her
      pink cheeks and her snappy black eyes . . . and Sarah dead
      a few months ago at eighty-six . . . or was it a few years
      ago . . . sunk down in white satin, like a little old
      dainty wax doll in a fancy box . . . Gus and Christine
      Reinmueller . . . and Christine over at the asylum now,
      where she sulked or shed pitiful old tears for her lost
      quarter-sections of land. Yes, it must have been right
      about here that they forded the creek. How glad they were
      to get here, after the tiresome three weeks' trip. They had
      formed a circle with the wagons, built their fire in the
      middle, and searched the ground for rattlesnakes before
      they let the babies out. The Indians had come and camped
      near them . . . friendly, it turned out . . . but how
      scared Marthy had been . . . and the boys weren't so easy
      until morning either.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he went on a little farther, he believed he could find
      the center spot where the land of the boys joined. Hadn't
      felt so strong in years . . . the walk was doing him good .
      . . all foolish to stick to sidewalks . . . he'd come down
      here often. Yes, it would be great sport to walk out into
      the middle of the section to the place where the farms used
      to meet. He felt closer to the old crowd than he had for
      years, as though they were all living, as though at any
      turn of the creek bed, he might come upon Henry or Will
      Deal or Gus Reinmueller. He could fancy the joking that
      would follow:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you doing here, old sneak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trying to slip up on me, was you, and steal one o' my
      shoats?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Good friends . . . all of the old crowd . . . help each
      other out every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked his way through the tangle of sumac and wild
      grapevine, thorn-apple and wild plum. Nothing like that
      smell anywhere in the world . . . not in California, that
      was sure,--irrigated fields and odorless roses. Thought
      he'd kind of lost his sense of smell, but it wasn't so. All
      he'd needed was to get down to a place like this where
      there was something <i>worth smelling . . .</i> great heads
      of wild phlox and the damp sweet odor of the undergrowth by
      the creek bed. Laboriously working his way through the
      tangle, he came out to the open cornfield. Gosh all
      hemlock! Look at the sky.

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At Meadowdale Allen and Laura parked near the station. The
      train came in surprisingly on time, and Jimmie, waving to
      the two on the platform, left on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen assisted Laura into the roadster, walked around to
      the other side and slipped in under the steering-wheel, but
      he did not start the car. Instead, he said suddenly, a
      little breathlessly: "Laura, you're going to-morrow, and as
      this is the last time I'll be seeing you, I've a lot of
      things to say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'll be back at Christmas, Allen. I'll see you then.
      That's not so far away,--four months only. That's one thing
      I've told Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn . . . that's one
      thing I'll never give up . . . and they're perfectly all
      right about it. I'm to come back every summer for a visit
      and <i>every</i> Christmas. You see, never having had
      children, that way, I think Christmas doesn't mean as much
      to them as it does to all of us out here. It does take
      children to make a Christmas, doesn't it? Look at the big
      Deal clan gathering every year. I can't <i>imagine</i>
      Christmas any place else." Laura was aware that she was
      chattering against time. She knew what was coming, and it
      was going to be hard. Allen was going to talk again about
      their marrying. And even if she were sure of herself, she
      couldn't marry him, now. If only she didn't like him so
      well, the thing wouldn't be difficult to handle at all. But
      the whole situation, now, was hard. It would take all her
      tact and patience to deal with Allen to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Allen was saying, "Personally, it isn't going to make
      any difference to me whether you come at Christmas time or
      not. For I'll not be seeing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had the sensation that she imagined one might have in
      an earthquake disturbance. She could have sworn that the
      car under her rocked a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      She managed a casual, "So? Is that a threat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--self-preservation. This is the last time . . .
      to-night . . . that we'll see each other . . . alone, I
      mean . . . ever. I'm through, of course, now. I've thought
      it all out last night, and to-day as I've gone about my
      work, and I'm through. You don't care for me, of course. If
      you did . . . nothing,--money, career, travel--nothing
      could keep you from me. I know that. I've got it through my
      head at last. I've been thick skinned, I'll admit,--thick
      skinned, thick headed and a fool. Lord knows, you've told
      me enough times you didn't care, but I've been fool enough
      to think . . ." he broke off, "until yesterday." He threw
      up his head. "Oh, well . . . I'm awake now, and I want you
      to know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was startled, but she managed a casual, "So a
      friendship doesn't mean much to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not such a darned lot--not when there's something bigger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we can't agree on that." She was talking without
      much thought. Her wits seemed wool gathering. "I think a
      genuine friendship a very beautiful thing,--I've even
      thought <i>our</i> friendship was a lovely thing, Allen.
      You've been one of the few people I could talk to . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd wanted to talk to me, you could have come and
      lived with me and talked to me all you wanted to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't convenient to marry all your friends, Allen."
      Laura was speaking stiffly, and with no apparent sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I see not." Allen was equally stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station agent came out, saw the parked car by the
      platform, and was about to tell the two young folks in it
      that the next train was not due for three hours, scratched
      his head, decided they didn't care whether it was or not,
      looked over at the low hanging clouds in the southwest, and
      went on home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was crazy enough, for a time, to think I could compete a
      little with all the career stuff. I thought I was equal to
      it. I had an idea lots of girls talked that way and didn't
      mean it. Apparently it's my rotten luck that you're the
      hundredth one that does. But I don't know any algebraic
      problem in which I'm equal to career plus money. But I do
      know one thing," he said warmly. "If the situation were
      reversed . . . if <i>I</i> had the choice . . . you against
      everything else . . . I'd take you . . . my youth and
      health and you. Everything else could go in the discard.
      The <i>earning</i> of the money would be the pleasure,--not
      having it thrown at you in a wad. What's a bunch of money,
      if you're capable of earning it? That's the game,--the
      <i>working."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're purposely putting it so it sounds cold-blooded and
      greedy, Allen. You know you are. It's <i>not</i> just the
      money. I've tried to make that clear, and you're purposely
      distorting it. Let me tell you something, Allen. I've been
      around now, enough to know there are some bigger things in
      the world than marriage and a prosaic settling down under
      one roof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I'll tell <i>you</i> something." He sat up straighter
      under the wheel. "There <i>isn't,--</i>not a thing--when
      it's two people who really care, and, and settling down
      under one roof, as you say, is the beginning of a real
      home. There's <i>nothing</i> finer. And now that I've
      convinced myself those are your real sentiments, and not
      just a temporary illusion, as I've been dunce enough to
      think,--I wouldn't want to marry you. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks for the chivalry, Allen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mention it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura tried to laugh, but the effort was slightly
      pointless. Always before, she could bring out that cheerful
      grin of Allen's, but apparently not to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And while we're talking," he went on . . . "as long as our
      friendship is so beautiful . . . it might be a good time to
      tell you that I'm not only through . . . I'm going to be
      married."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pulsing blood seemed beating loudly against Laura's
      throat, and pounding on her forehead. She was disgusted
      with herself that she felt so disturbed. "Who . . . is she,
      Allen? No,--let me guess." She found herself sparring for
      time, wanting to put off the answer. "Not . . . Dolores
      Thaxter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was rolling thunder in the distance but neither
      noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not . . . oh, Allen, not . . . Verna Conden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      At any other time Laura would have dimpled with sudden
      infectious laughter, and Allen would have grinned his
      wholesome grin. But they did neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought it all out. I did plenty of it last night and
      to-day." He went on hotly. "And I'm going to marry--soon.
      That isn't any spectacular spite affair, either. It's just
      a plain sensible procedure. There are other nice girls in
      the world. Because I haven't had eyes or thought for
      anybody but you, is no sign there aren't any. And before
      you leave, it isn't going to hurt you to know that I've
      pulled out of the mood I've been in all this time, and am
      going to hunt up one and marry her. I'm going to build . .
      . as fine a home as I can. Maybe you think fellows don't
      have any domestic side like that, to them. Of course,
      plenty don't. And then again, plenty of them do. And I'm
      one of them with a soft spot like that. I'm a little cuckoo
      on having a nice home of my own. I've loved you--deeply and
      sincerely. I still do--Heaven save the mark--I won't lie to
      you--but I can get over it, and I'm going to. Up to now,
      you've been the only girl I ever wanted to think of in a
      home of mine. But even though that's all over now, life is
      all before me, and I'll be darned if I'll let you and your
      theories about what's best in life spoil it."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he paused, it seemed there ought to be something said,
      so Laura emitted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be anxious to hear from you, Allen, . . . how things
      are going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. But you won't hear. Not from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not writing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly not. When we're through, we're through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This looks like a complete fade-out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Could they have overheard, a long array of ancestral
      feminine Deals and Mackenzies and Wentworths of the
      nineteenth century would have swooned at the blunt and
      unromantic dialogue. But they could not overhear. And
      twentieth century maidens swoon at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Laura managed a steady, "It'll seem awfully queer . . .
      without you, Allen . . . coming back to visit . . ." She
      broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent for a moment. The air was stifling
      and the dusk was descending. In a moment she went on:
      "That'll be kind of an odd affair, though, Allen,--just
      going out and hunting up a girl and bestowing your
      affections on her . . . sort of like going gunning for a
      pheasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't need to worry about that part," he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect not," Laura said dryly, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen cleared his throat carefully. "I decided . . .
      definitely, last night, or rather this morning, about the
      time the raincrows began to call . . . to take your
      decision like a good sport. If money and a so-called career
      mean everything in the world to you . . . if those are your
      true ideas of life,--well, it's not my place to talk back
      to the referee. I'll take the decision, and stop mooning
      around as though you were the only girl in the world. It'll
      probably be a stiff game at first . . . but I've made up my
      mind . . . and so . . . you're free to go your way, now,
      with no more interference from me. I thought it only right
      that you should know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura put her hand on Allen's arm. "It will seem . . .
      <i>awfully</i> queer, Allen . . . to think of all those
      times we've had together . . . never again to . . ." Her
      voice broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk like that," Allen said grimly. "And take your
      hand off of my arm," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura drew the offending member away as though it were
      scorched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope you'll be happy, Allen . . . with her,
      whoever she is. I'll wish you that, just as I want you to
      wish me well in my undertaking. I'll have to admit though,
      it isn't my idea of love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Allen said quickly, "it isn't your idea of love. Your
      idea of love is a <i>hot</i> one. <i>Your</i> idea of love
      is to strangle it by the throat. <i>Your</i> idea of love
      is . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      A great whirling cloud of dust rolled up the road toward
      the car and chokingly enveloped them. Simultaneously, a
      crimson flash of lightning laid open the sky, and crashing
      thunder rattled the windows of the station. Allen hurriedly
      backed away from the platform and started down the graveled
      road toward Cedartown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green roadster shot steadily over the miles, into the
      face of the storm.

    <h2>
      <a name="c26" id="c26">CHAPTER 26</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Old Oscar Lutz, coming out of the underbrush by the creek
      bed, was confronted with the sight of great tan and
      bilious-green low-scudding clouds tumbling over each other,
      as they rolled in from the southwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wind, that was going to be--the way the sickly green showed
      under the yellow. He must get back to Marthy. Pshaw,--how
      old thoughts and habits clung to people. Marthy had been
      gone for a quarter of a century; and here for a minute, he
      was thinking of her being afraid in the face of the
      oncoming storm. It was only of himself he had to think. He
      must get back before he got soaked and have to pay the
      price with a good old attack of rheumatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment leaning on the cane, trying to decide
      the better and quicker way,--through the cornfield and then
      the cemetery to the south, or to retrace his steps along
      the creek bed and by the old cottonwood to the west. Back
      by the creek bed again,--that was better. If a downpour
      came and he should be caught in Allen's recently cultivated
      cornfield, he'd be mired down in the rich black mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned back to the underbrush and working his way
      through to the creek bed, started to the west. It was
      stifling under the thick growth of wild plums and
      grapevines and sumac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightning! But far away. He could probably make the journey
      home before the storm struck. Better take it easy now.
      Wasn't any use trying to pelt along fast and get all
      winded,--just a good steady gait with his cane to help him.
      Couldn't go quite the same pace he used to when he could
      run up this draw toward home as fast as an Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fork of lightning cut across the sky. How scared
      Marthy would be if she were still up there in the old home.
      He pictured the house looking small and frail in the face
      of the oncoming storm, the vines over the door, still and
      lifeless, in the awesome hush of those moments preceding
      the wind. If it were back in the old days, Marthy would be
      lighting the lamps now, setting them in the two little
      kitchen windows, and then standing, frightened, in the
      middle of the floor and waiting to hear him halloo from the
      hilltop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queer, how much harder it seemed to go back through the
      undergrowth than the coming had been. It grew darker and
      more stifling. Hands clutched at him and held him
      back,--wild crab-apple hands. Feet were pushed out to trip
      him,--grapevine feet. His hat was knocked backward on his
      head and hawthorn branches scratched his forehead. A sharp
      spear of broken scrub oak was thrust into his side. His
      mouth brushed against a cluster of choke cherries, so that
      the taste for a moment was bitter. Some One Else had once
      known thorn pricks and a spear thrust and the taste of
      myrrh on the lips. He felt sorry for The Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly he emerged from the tangled undergrowth into
      the open space of the meadow. He felt a sense of relief and
      stopped to fill his closing lungs with the fresher air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was beginning now. The first gust came across the
      meadow grass like a trumpeter sent on to announce the
      approach of a powerful and evil thing. Old Oscar, leaning
      on his cane, could see the cottonwood bend before its
      portentous message. It seemed nodding and beckoning
      him,--the only old comrade left now from the early days.
      Queer, to think the little whip he had put in the ground
      over half a century ago was acting like a human to-night
      calling to him from the hill top. He started toward the
      hill. Beat all, how his legs would scarcely respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly, it grew darker, with swift descending
      blackness. Gone were the mellow twilight and the after-glow
      of the sunset. Gone were the peace of the meadows and the
      calm of the eventide. And in their place, darkness,--thick,
      black, warning. The dark alone could not worry him, though.
      He knew every stick and stone of the hillside. By feeling
      with his cane and seeing by the lightning flashes, he knew
      he could retrace his steps to the cottonwood. The rain
      would be coming along pretty soon now, following in the
      wake of the wind. Lightning again. The old plainsman's
      thoughts turned to his own safety. Better stay away from
      the cottonwood in the lightning. Trees were the settlers'
      best friends, but in a storm they went back on you,--in a
      big wind they turned traitors. The old cottonwood was
      beckoning, all right, but it couldn't fool him. No, sir,
      not in a storm, it couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck off diagonally, so that when he reached the top
      of the hill he would not be too close to the old monarch.
      The wind was coming harder now, so that he crushed his old
      black hat more securely on his head, and clung to his white
      scarf and cane the more tightly. It caught and held him at
      intervals so that he could only sway, his feeble old form
      making no progress whatever. A great gust took his hat, and
      wisps of his long white hair streamed out behind. He stood
      bewildered, as though part of himself had gone away on the
      wings of the wind. With his cane he felt around in the
      flattening grass, but the hat must have gone far before the
      onslaught and he gave up the futile search. He plodded on
      with a feeling of distinct loss. That was a good hat. He
      hadn't had it quite twelve years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain came now,--great sheets of it that threw
      themselves onto the meadow, not steadily, but in gusts as
      though the rain and the wind were dancing a jazz tune. It
      cut across his cheeks and forehead like the sting of a
      hundred whips. His white scarf was soggy and disagreeable
      to his throat. The long slope toward the hill was getting
      slippery. He had to dig his cane into the ground to pull
      himself along. Once he started to fall in the sodden grass,
      but recovered himself before he was completely down. With
      each step he waited for the return of his waning breath and
      the steadying of his swaying body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightning! Not just ordinary flashes, but great enveloping
      sheets of it. If Marthy were up there in the house now, she
      would be just about frightened to death. Good thing she was
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness was a thick, black, impenetrable thing. Only
      when the great flashes came, could he see to get his
      bearings. Always he looked for the cottonwood and steered
      his course by it. How it turned and twisted and writhed in
      agony,--like an old man up there on the hilltop it twitched
      and moaned and cried out in its torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the rain was hurling itself at him again, madly, so
      that involuntarily he threw his arms over his bare head. It
      lashed him in a frenzy, and he made no progress in the face
      of its violence. He wanted to cry out against its madness.
      But he could not, for he was choking in a sea of it. His
      lungs were closed air-tight things that would not
      function,--a pair of blacksmith's bellows that had
      collapsed. His mind, too, seemed unsteady, wavering. The
      wind and the rain were getting the best of him. He was too
      exhausted to go on. For a long time he stood swaying,
      holding himself upright only by the pressure of his weight
      on the cane sunk into the moist earth. For a moment he felt
      his consciousness slipping, as though he were drifting into
      some eternal oblivion. But by a superhuman effort he roused
      his waning forces and focused on one thought: He must pull
      himself together, and go on. It was just a little way
      farther to the top of the slope. He must go on. From there
      he could see . . . from there he could see . . . the lights
      of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled his cane slowly out of the hole it had made in
      the turf. Cautiously and with supreme concentration on the
      effort, he started, as one might carefully start an old and
      disabled piece of machinery to working, so that no false
      movement would shatter the results of the attempt. Every
      step was an exertion, every motion painful. But he must not
      heed such notions. Selfish, that was. Selfish . . .
      thinking of himself when Marthy was there alone in the
      house . . . scared . . . waiting for his halloo from the
      top of the hill. Maybe couldn't even hear him . . . but
      he'd keep his promise . . . try to let her know he was
      coming. Must get off his wet things as soon as he could get
      to the house . . . soaking wet . . . awful tired . . . but
      . . . keep going . . . and soon there'd be . . . two lights
      in the kitchen . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightning! More severe than any previous flash,--red
      lightning that hung leeringly over the hillside while the
      thunder crashed simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor girl . . . Marthy . . . just about . . . scared . . .
      to death. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He was stopped again. There was a long wait this time,
      while the wind snarled and the rain hurled itself upon him
      and the bellows of his lungs closed painfully. His mind was
      as beaten upon as his body. He wanted to go home. Everybody
      wanted to go home. When they got old, they knew. They
      understood. Sometime in their lives everybody wanted to get
      home. He wanted to get there now. He didn't know it was so
      far . . . home. It was <i>too</i> far. He wanted to whimper
      . . . to cry out. Would he ever see the lights? "God," he
      prayed, "all I ask is this . . . two lights . . . at home .
      . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was nearly to the top now. There was a brief cessation
      in the crushing force of the rain. One more effort and he
      would make it. He dug his cane into the sogginess of the
      grass, and with supreme concentration of his waning powers,
      pulled himself to the crest of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>God! There they were! The lights of home!</i> Right over
      the brow of the slope,--shining in the wind and the rain
      and the darkness. The two lights in the kitchen window.
      Blurred a little by the mad dashes of rain they were--but
      shining steadily. The sight of them brought back clarity to
      his beaten mind. He felt able to think straight again. Back
      there in the draw he had been befogged, confused,--now
      everything was clear. He was seeing life as from a mountain
      top. Queer how in moments of seeing life like this,
      everything fell away from one but its essentials . . . all
      the petty ills . . . arguments . . . quarrels . . .
      bickerings . . . envy . . . striving . . . scrambling . . .
      the mad dash for supremacy . . . everything fell out of
      one's consciousness but the lights of home and all they
      stood for. And he was home. He had conquered. He felt
      triumphant. Unconsciously he pointed to the lights with his
      cane. "Yoo-hoo . . ." he called. Queer, he was experiencing
      a rare moment of superb strength. The walk hadn't done him
      up after all. He felt strong. He stood tall and straight
      near the cottonwood, looking victoriously down on the two
      blinking lights. "Yoo-hoo," he called, more loudly than he
      could have expected. "Yoo-hoo, Marthy . . . comin'. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightning! A great wide sheet of fierce red flame that
      enveloped and blinded and stung him, even as the earth and
      skies crashed together, and the lights of home . . . were .
      . . blotted out. . . .

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For a few miles Allen drove rapidly, slowing only when
      great gusts of wind whipped up long clouds of dirt from the
      fields and dust from the highway. They came rolling across
      the country together, the low rolling clouds and the high
      flung dirt, so that one could not tell where the loose soil
      ended and vapor forms began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke. Allen drove grimly, silently, his eyes on
      the road. Laura watched the angry clouds, her thoughts as
      tumultuous as they. Quite suddenly it grew darker with
      swift descending blackness. Gone were the mellow twilight
      and the afterglow of the sunset. Gone were the peace of the
      meadows and the calm of eventide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I should have taken you in to McCullough's," Allen
      was frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll make it," was Laura's only comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're in for it now. It's as far back as it is on into
      town." Allen's own broad acres now lay between them and the
      cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain came. Great sheets of it that threw themselves
      onto the roadster, not evenly, but in gusts as though the
      rain and the wind were dancing a jazz tune. The two
      windshield wipers worked steadily, but they were no match
      for the downpour. The lamps shone brightly enough, but
      their glare seemed too feeble to pierce the density of the
      rain, and the brown trail of the highway was distorted.
      Driving was precarious business. Allen was barely crawling.
      Sometimes he stopped altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightning! Not just ordinary flashes, but great enveloping
      sheets of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each red glare and simultaneous crack of the thunder,
      Laura shuddered involuntarily. Once, with no volition of
      her own, she clutched Allen's arm, remembered her rebuff in
      the earlier evening and withdrew it hastily. Sensing it,
      and without taking his eyes from the gravel, Allen said:
      "Nervous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not especially." Every nerve was taut, every muscle
      strained. "I'm glad though I'm. . ." She was on the verge
      of saying, "with you," but stopped herself in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad you're what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . on rubber tires." She finished lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen fell grimly silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was worse now if anything. No sign of the highway was
      visible. They might have been poised in mid-air with the
      open sea beneath them. For a few moments they stopped again
      while the fury of the storm lashed them. Then it ceased and
      there was a distinct lull so that Allen started on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the flood gates were opened, and the fury of the
      wind-blown water stopped progress altogether. Then another
      interval of rain, less furious, while the lightning
      quivered without ceasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there seemed then a definite lurching of the car.
      "A flat," Allen's tone registered supreme disgust. "As a
      matter of fact, I've been suspicioning it for some time,
      but thought I'd give it mental treatment."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped again. For the first time a glimmer of his
      old self returned. "Will you kindly sing a verse from 'A
      Night Like This'? Well . . ." he peered out into the
      blackness. "I don't like to run on in and have it ruined.
      We're either near my west pasture or the cemetery . . . at
      the next flash, I can tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next flash was an immediate reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen took advantage of it to get his bearings. "We're
      opposite the pasture. If I can see to get across . . .
      there's a rough culvert across the ditch into the meadow .
      . . I don't care to stand here in the road and run the risk
      of being hit . . . not that traffic's going to be dense. .
      . ." He was driving slowly, waiting for a flash to show him
      the cattle-crossing. When he had located it, he turned on
      to the meadow crossing. But he was not satisfied. "I'll
      open the pasture gate," he told Laura, "and drive on in.
      I'm not keen about this long car protruding out into the
      highway. Nobody would be going north but the doctor or bank
      robbers, but I don't intend to be hit by either."
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the car door and the cold wind rushed in so that
      Laura shivered from the sudden change. From under the
      rumble seat he unearthed a raincoat and sweater, slipped
      into the coat and helped Laura pull the big sweater with
      its football insignia over her head. The simple act brought
      a quick mist to her eyes--she could not have told why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allen, I hate to have you," she was saying, "out that way
      on the wet ground . . . with so much electricity."
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything happened to Allen . . . ! But she caught herself
      up at that. Something already had happened to Allen. She
      and Allen were through with their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was opening the gate now, as the rain abated for a
      moment. Then he was back at the wheel and driving into the
      edge of the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Hand guided them into the green pasture? Who led them
      by the still waters of the creek bed? What Purpose was
      achieved? What Destiny fulfilled? For how could Allen and
      Laura know that they were bringing peace to a tired old man
      in the storm? How could they know that to a weary old man
      on the hilltop, the lights of the car were the lights of
      home?
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen, out in the rain which sometimes slackened and
      sometimes poured, jacked the car and changed the wheel,
      with Laura over on the driver's side holding the flash, and
      cringing at every glare of lightning. How queer that she
      and Allen should spend their last evening like this. The
      odors of the pasture were penetrating,--cold wet loam,
      clean crushed leaves, and the poignant moist smell of the
      meadow grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched Allen at his task, his supple fingers working
      nimbly in the rain. When he had finished he wiped his hands
      on a handkerchief, and dripping with moisture came to the
      running board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, still on the wheel side, suddenly caught his arm.
      "Listen, Allen, what was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. The wind in the cottonwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Allen . . . it sounded human . . . something . . .
      sort of weird. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen, head up, was listening too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yoo-hoo . . . Marthy . . . comin'!" It came out of the
      storm with eerie faintness,--the cry of a bittern for its
      companion, a loon for its mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was out and shaking nervously against Allen's arm, so
      that he slipped it about her shivering body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allen--did you hear--what I heard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry--just some boys . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yoo-hoo . . . Marthy . . . comin' . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, a great sheet of lightning in one terrific
      wave of yellow light swept and enveloped the whole
      hillside. For a few seconds the hill was bathed in the
      brilliant reddish glare, so that every object was distinct.
      The cottonwood was so well defined that it seemed but a few
      feet away. Nothing was hidden--every grass blade, every
      stone, every leaf, was magnified as though by gigantic
      binoculars.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, the hillside was a great scarlet etching,
      without a line missing,--a monstrous picture painted by a
      huge brush with the red blood of the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in that brief second, so ghastly and terrible, they saw
      him. Silhouetted against the great red painting, he stood
      on the hilltop. Tall, gnarled, drawn to his full height he
      stood, his grizzled gray beard sweeping back in the wind.
      Something white fluttered back with his beard--it looked
      like a mantle. Something was in his outstretched arm. It
      looked like a staff. For that brief moment, there on the
      highest point of the rolling hill . . . not far from the
      cottonwood . . . he stood with outstretched arms like one
      of the prophets. Elijah, he might have been,--or Moses, who
      having led his people into a new country, was leaving them
      with his benediction. Already the cottonwood struck through
      its heart was dividing, the half tottering for the fall.
      With wrenching, twisting contortions the last old monarch
      of the hilltop was swaying toward the last old man of the
      prairie. Allen shouted, but his voice was drowned in the
      crash of the thunder. Whether the old man saw it . . . or
      was unheeding . . . they could not know. He only stood
      there with outstretched arm, looking toward them, and made
      no move.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the tree toppled--protecting, shielding her, Allen with
      swift tender movement swept Laura into his arms and turned
      her away from the red glare of the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="c28" id="c28">CHAPTER 28</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For what seemed like long moments, Allen held Laura tightly
      while the cottonwood twisted and toppled and crashed toward
      them with a great crackling, swishing sound of rain-soaked
      branches. Leaves and sticks and water showered them, and
      the thunder died away into some cavern between the worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Allen was releasing her and saying shortly: "Get back
      in the car, Laura." And Laura was slipping her hand into
      his and answering: "No--I'm going to stay with you, Allen,"
      half wondering even then if it had a double meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand in hand they ran through the pasture and up the
      slippery, sloping hillside, the rain beating in their
      faces, and the soaked grass and weeds clutching at them
      with long clammy fingers. A sharp stick turned under
      Laura's foot and penetrated the flesh of the other ankle,
      but at the pain she only caught her lips in her teeth and
      made no outcry. Her white dress of the afternoon was a rag
      of mud and water and her hair a sodden thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prostrate half of the tree looked immeasurably larger
      than when it had been standing on the hillside. The huge
      branches seemed coming to meet them before they were
      halfway to the top of the hill where it had grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay here, Laura," Allen was telling her, and with the
      flashlight was working his way in through the mass of
      splintered branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched his light flicker here and there through the
      dim picture, for strangely enough, the lightning was no
      longer illuminating. It only flashed occasionally far away
      to the northeast, as though having vented its anger on the
      one community, it had gone on to find some other place for
      its wild orgy of sport. It took an immeasurably long time
      for Allen to return. The light kept flickering low to the
      ground far away. At times she could see a bit of Allen's
      figure silhouetted against the feeble glow. And then it was
      coming back, now high, now low, its light dancing up and
      down like a weird will-o'-the-wisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How . . . ? What . . . ?" Laura began, her throat aching
      with the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's dead," Allen said quietly, and slipped his arm around
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that she remembered. <i>I want to go quick . .
      . like a tree in the wind.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Allen . . ." She could say nothing more. It was such a
      terrible thing--death, at any time. But out here, alone, in
      the wind and the rain!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do anything without help," Allen said. "He's
      pinned . . . underneath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen's arm still around her, they went silently back down
      the slope of the hill through the sodden grass. There were
      the same odors of the night,--cold wet loam, clean crushed
      leaves and the poignant moist smell of the meadow grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the car she said, "Oh, Allen, life is so terrible!
      Such a mixture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The big things are simple," he answered briefly, and they
      got into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the short ride into town for help, with the
      thunder dying entirely away and the wind calm after its mad
      fury--with Laura wet and bedraggled, winking back nervous
      tears in her corner of the car, hungry for a comforting
      word from Allen,--with Allen stiff and stern at the wheel,
      longing to take her again in his arms as he had done in the
      storm, but knowing what folly it would be,--and with old
      Oscar Lutz lying peacefully back there on the hillside
      after having looked on the lights of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen people were ready to go out to the fallen
      cottonwood and old Oscar. Many hands were willing to
      perform the last tender ministrations. It is characteristic
      of the small town and rural districts. Sympathy there takes
      concrete form. It becomes cakes and cinnamon rolls and
      sitting up nights, husking corn and washing dishes and
      closing the eyes of the neighboring dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen took Laura up to the door of her home after he had
      notified those nearest the catastrophe and directed the
      men. People were moving about in old Oscar Lutz's house
      next door. There were lights in many rooms, for old Oscar
      was coming home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on in, Allen, and get dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely unnerved by the scene on the hill, confused
      mentally, shaken physically, intuitively homesick because
      she was leaving under this combination of circumstances,
      Laura felt the need of Allen. This whole year he had always
      had the faculty of helping her set things straight in her
      mind when she was disturbed. His dependability, his
      substantial philosophy and his sense of humor,--ever since
      she had known him well, she had always been able to count
      on them all to steady her when she was bewildered. And
      to-night, she was more bewildered than she had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Allen was saying, "I'll not come in. I'll go on over
      to the house and see if there's anything more I can do.
      Change your clothes right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh . . . your sweater!" She began tugging at the big soggy
      woolen thing and Allen helped her pull it off. The simple
      little act made her feel like crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't go to-morrow now." There was temporary relief in
      her mind. "I couldn't . . . not now . . . after good old
      Uncle Oscar has gone this way. I'll stay until after the
      services . . . until Friday at least, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll say 'good-by' now just the same." Allen held out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now?" Laura repeated stupidly. "Why . . . I thought . . .
      maybe . . . staying over . . . this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, now," Allen said. "It's better. After the decision,
      it's much the best way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, not now! Some other time, Laura's heart cried out. But
      not now. Why <i>"now"</i> was right this minute. Allen was
      holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura put her hand in his mechanically. Allen held it
      lightly for only the fraction of a minute. Then he dropped
      it quickly and slipped his hands into his raincoat pockets.
      "Well . . ." he tried to grin, "Happy landing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, what could you say? What could you do? This couldn't be
      the end of everything. A year of close friendship, and a
      handshake to end it. Dozens of intimate talks and only a
      stupid "good-by" at the finish. This wasn't the way life
      was meant to be. Life was meant to be a sweet unhampered
      thing, joyful and gay. It should have everything in
      it,--wealth and travel and happiness and a career and
      friends and Allen. And if it couldn't have them all . . .
      oh, it ought to have Allen. It ought, anyway, to have
      Allen. With the rapidity in which the human mind can
      travel, her thoughts went back to that moment when Allen
      had swept her into his arms to protect her from the sight
      of the tragedy on the hillside . . . even then, the
      impending disaster to the old man had been momentarily lost
      in a greater emotion. It had been as though in that one
      brief bitter-sweet moment, she had been swept again into
      some haven, had become the center of some great plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by . . ." It was Allen's voice, strange and far away.
      He had the old sweater over his arm and his hat in his
      hand. He was turning. He was going. She must say something.
      Life was stopping. Life was standing still. After Allen
      would go down the steps for the last time . . . there would
      be nothing left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allen . . ." Her throat was dry and the words were hard to
      frame. "When I come back Christmas . . . we'll . . .
      couldn't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was down the wet steps with the street lights shining
      across a mat of glistening, soggy leaves. He turned, his
      hat still in his hand. The light shone across his blond
      head with the three waves in his hair . . . and his blue
      eyes. His chin was up and he lifted his hat high . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . and good luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura turned and went fumbling into the house. She climbed
      the stairs to her room blindly and went in to its
      comforting darkness. Her dress crackled stiffly about her
      wet limbs and she felt numb from its moist coldness. Her
      ankle hurt and, stooping, she felt blood on her stocking.
      Through the window she could see the lights in the old
      mansion. There were cars in front of the house and a sound
      of many feet going up the front walk, tramping rhythmically
      as though in unison. She remembered again that old Oscar
      Lutz was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ought to feel sad about old Oscar. But she
      couldn't,--not a bit. What did it matter that old Oscar
      Lutz was dead? What did anything matter? She walked
      aimlessly about in her crackling skirt and water-soaked
      shoes. Her mind too went about, but not aimlessly. It was
      groping desperately, clutching for something upon which to
      steady itself. She tried to drive it to think of a white
      bird flying,--to call up visions of silver wings in the
      distance. But it would not obey. There was no white bird
      and no sheen of silver wings. Nothing but blackness and
      loss and deep despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down by the window, her wet things clinging
      clammily to the chintz of the chair. Only once before in
      her life had she suffered so, and that once by comparison
      seemed a frail and fragile experience. Once when she had
      come to the full realization that never again could she
      read her things to Grandma Deal, she had sensed this same
      feeling that she was her real self,--not that imaginative
      person who looked on at other people. And to-night she was
      her real self. She was down to the very core of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother came down the hall and turned on the light in
      front of her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You here? Why are you in the dark? Isn't it awful about
      old Oscar? I came to change my dress before going over
      there. They say you and Allen saw him struck. Well, poor
      old Uncle Oscar,--that was a hard way to go. Now where do
      you suppose his money will land? I think your father knows,
      but he wouldn't deign to tell <i>me,</i> of course. That's
      one thing about Uncle Harry Wentworth. He doesn't keep
      people guessing. Just came right out and told that you
      would be his heir. Just think, Laura, do you ever try to
      comprehend what that is going to mean to you? I wish I knew
      how much it is. It's plenty though--<i>good</i> and plenty.
      You'll never have to worry about finances . . . and I can
      tell you one thing, Laura, if I could have eliminated all
      the worry about finances from my life . . . I'd have been
      far happier. It seems as though every one of the relatives
      has been better fixed than we. Your Uncle Mack . . . of
      course his big start was through Emma's money from her
      father's estate, but he had the faculty of knowing how to
      invest and increase it--something your father didn't seem
      to have. Your Aunt Margaret and Doctor, too . . . but your
      father just never had that way of making big money . . .
      always working hard for small fees . . . always helping the
      underdog and doing things for nothing. Well, the day I had
      you go and visit Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn was a great
      day for you, I must say, Laura. And don't ever forget your
      mother made it possible. You can thank your mother for
      putting you in a position where you can do <i>big
      things."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Laura burst into unaccustomed nervous tears. To
      which her mother, with the same degree of understanding she
      had always shown for her daughter's moods, returned: "My
      soul! Don't take that old man's death so hard. Why, he's
      been ready to go for years. Tomorrow you'll be away from it
      all, and headed straight for what will be a far easier,
      pleasanter life than I ever dreamed you could have, Laura."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura sobbed uncontrollably in the depths of her confusion
      and misery. How could she tell her? How could she say that
      she had been on a long emotional journey and back again?
      How could this ambitious mother see that a young woman,
      with a head full of fancies and a heart full of longing,
      had come to the bend in the road? How could she know that
      one's mind said to go one way and one's heart another?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not of old Oscar Lutz that I'm thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      How could she understand there was no sheen of silver wings
      and no white bird flying?
    </p>
    <p>
      And so a greater share of the night, Laura shed tears into
      her soft white pillow. Some of them were for old Oscar Lutz
      dying on the hillside all alone in the wind and the rain.
      Some of them were for the general sad fact that hours fly
      and flowers die. But most of them were shed because of her
      own sudden and definite realization that even though there
      come new days and new ways,--love stays.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise thought it ridiculously unnecessary that Laura
      postpone her trip for the services of an old man who was
      not even a relative. "That's twice you've put it off, and
      if I were superstitious at all, it would worry me," she
      volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Laura was stubborn. "I'm not going--not until Saturday.
      I always liked old Oscar." It was a worthy excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characteristically, Eloise took charge of everything over
      at the old man's house. She baked and cleaned and met
      people at the door. She took care that the flowers were all
      credited to their rightful donors,--"the sheaf of lilies
      from Mack and Emma," "the red carnations from Margaret and
      Doctor Baker," "the pink roses from our family, Laura, and
      put them right there at the front where they can be seen."
      A queer mixture was Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura arranged the flowers mechanically, without much
      thought of what she was doing. Death,--what was it?
      Life,--what was that, too? It seems a warm lovely
      thing,--and then suddenly it becomes a cold and dull
      thing,--a mere matter of packing and taking a train and
      going about with a noisy old Uncle and a stupid old Aunt.
      In the meantime there was one more day at home near--one
      more day at home, for old Oscar was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, to add to the confusion and the work, Isabelle
      and Harrison Rhodes drove in unexpectedly from Chicago on
      their annual pilgrimage. Laura's Aunt Isabelle and Uncle
      Harrison were two of those souls who live in a rarefied
      atmosphere so musical that mere matters of food and
      dishwashing do not disturb them. They had intended to go to
      Mack's first, in Omaha, as indeed they had written him, but
      with the same ease they employed in transposing keys for a
      song, suddenly decided to try the new Waubonsie bridge at
      Nebraska City. Inasmuch as the new bridge had held up under
      the strain of their light coup, they had come on to
      Cedartown. And here they were, smiling happily, pleased
      that no one expected them, and very, very hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that capacity for handling situations, Eloise rose to
      the occasion and added a big company dinner to her tasks
      over at the old Lutz house. Eloise was a mixture of traits,
      good and bad, but never indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The services for old Oscar were on Friday afternoon. Humans
      are queer. A man, living and well, is ignored or
      criticized. Dying or dead, he is noticed and praised. Death
      sheds a temporary glamour over the poorest soul. It is as
      though in dying, he has accomplished something which life
      never gave him. The sound of old Oscar Lutz's cane
      thump-thumping on the sidewalks of Cedartown had often
      brought boredom, impatience, and annoyance to its citizens.
      It had set women to closing doors quietly so that old Oscar
      would think there was no one at home. It had reminded men
      suddenly that they had business elsewhere. Only the
      children had remained interested and unannoyed. And now
      that the sound was no longer heard and the cane hung idly
      on its hook in the decaying Lutz mansion, women missed the
      friendly tap-tap and the gifts of radishes or carrots or
      beets. Men recalled the active mind and the stability of
      the kind old man. Only the children ceased to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was lovely. Nebraska's skies were never more
      fair. Long rippling white clouds slipped lazily across the
      blue, billowing out like the canvases of phantom
      covered-wagons seeking homes in some far new country. Since
      the big rain there had been two cool days and now a fresh
      little breeze came across the prairie and brought with it
      the scent of the loam and the fields, and the honey
      sweetness of newly cut red clover. Yellowing fields of corn
      rippled sinuously in the breeze with faint rustling sounds
      of the long tan-colored leaves. Tall feathery spikes of
      goldenrod laced together Nature's gown of tans and greens.
      Dark green were the fields of alfalfa and lavender dotted
      with their perfumed blossoms. Dark green were the pastures
      and still were the waters. Nebraska was bidding its old
      settler farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cars came over the long graveled highways from every
      direction. The sons of the pioneers, and their sons, and
      their sons' sons came to see old Oscar Lutz returned to the
      sod which he had broken when the state was young. Country
      communities have not yet ceased to pause in their work long
      enough to pay respect to the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, in a state of mental tumult, went to the services
      with her mother. Her father was a pallbearer with some of
      the Rinemillers, sons of the men with whom old Oscar had
      neighbored in that early day of which he was so fond. Uncle
      Mack and Aunt Emma, Stanley and his wife, Jimmie and Kathie
      came into the church together as the nearest relatives. It
      seemed queer to see Kathie in the role of mourner. She had
      on a modish dark tailored suit and chic little hat. She
      looked lovely and solemn, but ready to break into high
      rippling laughter. Laura, sitting over at the side of the
      church with Eloise, envied Kathie that infinite capacity to
      be light and airy and unconcerned the moment a difficult
      incident was closed. She herself was too serious, too
      introspective. She thought things out coolly. Kathie took
      whatever came her way without question. She used her
      head,--Kathie her heart. She had a multitude of standards
      and ideals up to which she tried to measure,--Kathie had
      one unfailing rule: to get all the happiness she could out
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was flower-scented. People spoke to each other
      in whispers in that hushed way they employ when in the
      presence of the dead. As though the dead knew or cared.
      Before the sermon a quartette sang "The Beautiful City" and
      afterward "A City Foursquare." How unsuitable, Laura
      thought. Singing of cities for old Oscar Lutz, who did not
      like any kind of pavement,--who would not want to go
      tap-tapping on the golden streets of which they sang,--Old
      Oscar, who wanted to be in the prairie wind and a part of
      the prairie sod, and to hear the sound of the wild geese
      honking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cemetery, the narrow house was ready for old Oscar.
      Sod houses in the beginning of the pioneer days,--and sod
      houses at the end. Next to it was Martha's grave, sunken
      level to the grass line with the snows of many winters--old
      Oscar's Marthy, whose love had not died at her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked on at the proceedings in a numb unfeeling way.
      She saw the people and the cars, but they meant nothing.
      She felt calloused, hard, as though heart and mind were
      paralyzed. Nothing touched her. Nothing would ever touch
      her again. A few days ago and the scene would have aroused
      her emotions, brought the ready mist to her eyes. She would
      have wanted to write it, would have loved putting down on
      paper the feel of the atmosphere. She felt she would never
      write again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she saw Allen through the crowd. He stood beside
      his mother, hat in hand. Laura's heart throbbed dully in
      actual pain. He looked big and fine standing there beside
      his plump little mother. Gone were the ready smile and the
      gay carefree expression. He looked grave and
      serious--manly, capable. The girl that Allen married would
      be in strong, efficient hands. Laura thought she could not
      stand it to think of her, whoever she would be. The words
      of the minister came with vibrant tones across the
      distance: "Here in the same spot where he first turned the
      virgin prairie . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ought to be thinking of kind old Uncle Oscar, but she
      could not bring her errant thoughts into subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ashes to ashes: dust unto dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen would marry,--and she would be East. Allen would
      build a lovely home,--and she would be dancing attendance
      on fat old Aunt Carolyn. Allen would bring some nice girl
      to that home,--and she would be listening to foppish old
      Uncle Harry's vapid remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no question about her love for Allen, now. The
      previous two long nights had shown her that. She went over
      the facts for the hundredth time. She had made her
      decision, and it was not the right one. Only three days ago
      she had said, "Surely there's something more for me than
      life gave my Grandmother!" To-day her whole heart was
      crying out: "What is there to life if you do not follow
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked across at Allen far on the other side of the
      groups of people. What if she would just walk across the
      grass and the graveled paths and say to him simply, "I'm
      going to stay with you, Allen?" Why, how terrible! <i>How
      terrible!</i> She felt suddenly fearful of herself, as
      though she might do that crazy thing with no volition of
      her own. She pressed her lips together and clenched her
      hands in tense rigidity. People didn't do things like
      that,--civilized people. That was what civilization
      was,--covering up elemental emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet weird sound of a bugle came from the trees beyond
      the grave. Taps over the grave of old Oscar. And taps over
      the grave of Laura's love for Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Good-night . . . good-night.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet dreams . . . and good-night.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The group about the Lutz lot was breaking up now. People
      were visiting happily and volubly. There were no close
      relatives to mourn, and now that respect had been paid to
      the old man, the affair was turned into something of a
      social event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was asking Dr. Fred Baker and her Aunt Margaret
      and Aunt Grace to come over to the house to a pick-up
      supper. Her father and mother and Uncle Harrison and Aunt
      Isabelle were going to be there. "You come, too, Aunt
      Eloise, you and Uncle John and Laura and The Tribulation.
      We're all here, and it will be a nice way for Laura to see
      everybody before she leaves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are so many of us, Kathie." Aunt Margaret was
      saying, "When the Deals get together it looks like the old
      settlers' picnic. Are you sure you can feed us all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't just say there will be twelve baskets of
      Parker house rolls and canned salmon, or whatever it was
      that John the Baptist or somebody had left over," Kathie
      was a little vague in her Biblical reference, "but we'll
      make it go as far as it will. And if Aunt Eloise here has
      any cold turkey or angel food cake concealed about her
      person, she can bring it along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly." Eloise stepped into the managership. "I have
      plenty of bread and two pounds of Mrs. Miller's nice fresh
      butter, some cold meat, and half a cake, a fruit salad and
      three dozen cookies." Eloise could take an inventory of her
      possessions, even when far from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it turned out that all the visiting Deals went over to
      the lovely little English cottage that was Katherine's.
      Laura at her own home helped her mother pack three baskets,
      although there is some room for argument about the quality
      of her assistance, for she put things in and took them out
      and was impractical and indefinite in what she was doing.
      Life, like a swift river, seemed sweeping her along to the
      brink of some deep chasm and she could not stay it. When
      later, they went over to Kathie's, the friendly familiar
      faces of all the relatives gathered there seemed looking on
      at her unsympathetically, with no offer of aid or
      compassion. She looked at them all,--the fat florid face of
      Uncle Mack, the calm unruffled one of Aunt Margaret, the
      prim one of Aunt Grace--and the others,--and wondered dully
      why they would not help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to scream out, "Oh, stop,--listen! Help me, some
      one. Don't be so complacent. Can't you see I'm suffering?
      Can't you see I'm getting near the falls?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But what could you do, now? There was nothing to do.
      Everything was settled. She had chosen. She was going back
      to Uncle Harry Wentworth and Aunt Carolyn. They expected
      her. But she didn't want to. O God, she didn't want to. Not
      now. Not now, when she loved Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was full of relatives. Patty was downstairs,--the
      center of attention. Every one was chattering. There was
      laughter. Sometimes, they referred to Laura's leaving.
      "Well, Laura, I suppose you'll soon be skylarking around
      doing big things." <i>Big things!</i> What were the big
      things of life? Once she would have said they were leaving
      Cedartown and going in for a career. Now the leaving seemed
      inconsequential, the career merely hypothetical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother and Aunt Margaret, Aunt Emma and Katherine were
      all in the kitchen, making sandwiches, cutting cake,
      opening bottles of olives. Aunt Isabelle was playing softly
      on Kathie's baby grand. Aunt Grace was wiping trays.
      Stanley's wife was entertaining Patty and her own two
      youngest children with a tale of some sort. The men--all
      the Uncles and her father and Stanley and Jimmie were
      talking together in groups while waiting for the food. Trib
      was covertly eating purloined cookies. It was a typical
      clan gathering with almost every one there,--every one but
      Grandma. And yet, she seemed as much there in the crowd as
      any one of these whose presence was visible. After all the
      years it still seemed that way. She had always felt
      it,--the presence of Grandma when the clan came together.
      She could almost hear her comments on whatever subject was
      under discussion. "Mack, turn around. You're getting balder
      every day. That's because you used to make fun of old man
      Johnson." "No, Grace, I can't agree with you. I don't care
      if it <i>is</i> in a scientific book." Grandma had always
      known her own mind, had stood her own ground even to her
      eightieth year.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, she felt the presence of Grandmother Deal, as
      always--that same unexplainable presence of the woman who
      had mothered them all, whose love for her children and her
      children's children was so deep that after all the years it
      still seemed a tangible thing, delicate and rare, like the
      faint subtle odor of a fine perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could such things be, she wondered vaguely, standing there
      in the hall doorway and looking on? Could the loved dead
      come back? At a time like this, was the memory of them so
      keen to one sensitive like herself, that they only seemed
      to return and mingle with those to whom they had been
      devoted? Or was there in some way unknown to humans, a
      definite magical blending of these imperishable spirits
      with the mortal spirits of those they had so deeply loved?
      If it were possible--if Grandmother could return and slip
      cheerily into the circle, how easy and natural it would be
      to go to her, now, and pour into her listening ear the
      confession of this terrible aching in her heart. Out of
      them all, Grandmother would be the one she would choose to
      whom to talk. She could say to her quite easily:
      "Grandma--what shall I do? I've come to the forks of the
      road . . . the same crossroads that you told me about long
      ago. I've made my decision, and I've found it's all wrong.
      I know now--if love is one way and the kingdoms of the
      earth the other, there is only one way to take. But it's
      too late, now. I can't seem to talk to one of these. You
      are the only one who will understand. I'm going tomorrow.
      And I won't see Allen again. I thought I was wise, but I
      was ignorant. I thought I knew more than you, but I didn't.
      I thought you could master love, but it masters you. You,
      with your limited schooling, how wise you were. I, with my
      education, how little I have known. See, I kneel at your
      feet to confess this, for my heart is breaking. All my life
      I've mixed realities with dreaming,--and now, it's too
      late. The thing I dreamed about and wanted, Grandma, may
      become real. And Allen, who was real, will always remain a
      memory. You chose, once, between two roads. You said it was
      the right way. How did you know? How did you choose?
      <i>Why</i> did you choose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"I saw Will Deal coming down the lane."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It came into her mind as readily and distinctly as though
      her Grandmother had said it. It came gently, soothingly, as
      surcease for her troubled thinking. Standing there in the
      doorway, looking at the noisy, talkative relatives getting
      their plates and their napkins for the buffet supper, it
      seemed to Laura that Grandma had spoken, that the very aura
      of her presence was near, the very tones of her voice
      familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just coming down the lane, Grandma? Was that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Just coming down the lane."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She could almost hear the gentle cadence of the words, the
      finality of the tones, as though there could have been no
      other answer. Grandma had faced life that way always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly, and almost miraculously, the thing seemed
      simple. Why had she hesitated when there was only one
      solution possible? It was as easy as that. She felt calm
      and content, and something infinitely stronger than
      either--something unmistakably firm and resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise thrust a tray into her hands. "Here, Laura." She was
      worried and agitated. "Let's have some order here, folks."
      She raised her voice, "Get right in line. My goodness,--the
      only way to do anything right is to have it systematized."
      As one might as well have tried to systematize the water in
      Stove Creek as a laughing, garrulous crowd of Deal
      relatives, there was very little result to Eloise's attempt
      to bring order out of chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura broke away from her mother with, "Not now, Mother,
      thanks,--later," and ran to the kitchen, bumping into
      Katherine bringing in a quivering gelatine concoction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrors, Laura,"--as a miniature seismic disturbance shook
      the mound--"training for the track team?" But Laura paid no
      attention to her excepting to say, "Kathie, may I take your
      car two minutes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure--but what do you want?" She called to the fleeing
      girl. "We have everything we need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--not everything," Laura shot back, and was immediately
      out the door and in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a frantic moment she could not get the car started.
      Then the engine responded, and she was down the driveway
      and out on the street turning east. She felt gay,
      light-hearted, intoxicated with her sudden decision. The
      top of the convertible coup was down, and she waved
      cordial greetings to children playing on sidewalks. She
      drove fast so that a night watchman on his way to work,
      recognizing only the car, decided he would report that
      harum-scarum Mrs. Jimmie Buchanan to headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      August sunshine lay over the low rolling hills and the
      meadows. There was in the air that late summer odor
      peculiar to the Midwest--a mingling of the smells of
      roadside weeds and drying hay, of ripening apples and
      rustling corn, of honey-sweet alfalfa and the lovely dainty
      scent from a field of clover bloom. The six o'clock whistle
      blew. She increased her speed. "The ride to the rescue,"
      she said to herself, and laughed at the humor of it. She
      passed her grandmother's old farm house at the edge of
      town, dingy and empty now, passed the cedars and the
      orchard and part of the Rinemiller corn lands and came
      nearer to the square white house set back in the wide green
      lawn. She could see Allen's mother dressed as she had been
      at the services, going in the side door, could see old Tom
      Dickson, the hired man, and young Tom, his son, carrying
      milk pails to the kitchen door. She could see Allen
      stepping out of the garage and closing the long doors
      behind him. She turned into the long driveway. <i>Allen was
      coming down the lane.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked amazed, incredulous. "Laura?" he said as though
      it were a question, and came hurriedly toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was breathless as though she, herself, had been the
      motor power by which the hurried trip had been made.
      Although she was having a difficult time with her
      respiration, she was smiling gayly, as though she knew a
      great piece of news. "Allen," she called out, almost before
      he had reached the car, "have you shot that pheasant . . .
      I mean, have you picked out that girl yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nit-wit!" he said, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get in here," she spoke commandingly, "get in and ask no
      questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung agilely over the door. "Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"And</i> ask no questions," she repeated briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen's mother came out on the side porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I take your son away for a little while?" Laura called
      gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can <i>have</i> him," she shrugged her plump shoulders
      in mock disgust: "He's a sullen little boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura turned the car without a word and they swung out of
      the driveway and turned toward town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the big idea?" Allen wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you think Russia is riding for a fall, do you? But
      then, there are others who feel the same way." She was as
      gay and light-hearted as Kathie in her gayest moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be terribly clever, whatever it is," Allen said
      dryly; "do you, yourself, know what you're doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I realize, of course, that some people think the next war
      will be between capital and labor, some between the drys
      and the wets,--myself, I think it will be between those who
      eat spinach and those who don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the old Deal house standing forlornly behind
      the cedars, came to pavement and turned to the south fine
      residential portion of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see," Allen said meditatively, "when they're bad,
      you humor them until you can get a good jiu-jitsu hold. See
      the birdie?" he asked pleasantly, and pointed to the
      Jacksons' police dog nosing along the road. Then, with one
      hand on the wheel, he suddenly closed his other arm tightly
      around Laura's arms and pinned them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you touch me . . . don't you dare!" She was laughing
      and frightened, gay and worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned the corner of the street, then, that led to
      Katherine's home, and Allen could see all the cars around
      the curb and in the driveway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord . . . what <i>is</i> this, . . . really, Laura . . .
      no fooling?" He was serious and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out," Laura said shortly, "get out and follow me." At
      the porch she said tensely, "It's the Deals . . .
      <i>all</i> of them . . . <i>every one . . .</i> but if
      <i>I</i> can face the music, you can too. Buck up." They
      were at the door now. "It's a horribly bad dose, Allen. I'm
      sorry for you, but it won't last long."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stepped in, Laura, flushed and starry-eyed and a bit
      disheveled,--Allen, big and clean-cut and a bit dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Deals were, indeed, there. It looked like a
      convention of the Parent Teachers Association. With trays
      on their laps, on end tables, on card tables, on the piano
      bench, the big crowd of relatives sat. The rooms were full
      of them,--the Mackenzie Deals and the Stanley Deals and the
      John Deals, the Bakers and the Rhodeses and the Buchanans.
      As one man they looked up, and seeing the two young people,
      flushed and breathless, all activities, both of a
      conversational and gastronomic nature, immediately ceased.
      Sandwiches were poised in mid-air. Forks ceased their
      perpendicular traveling. Somebody dropped an olive and in
      the stillness it bounced on the hardwood floor like a
      billiard ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had a swift vision of a composite picture of
      Deals--her mother's serious eyes fixed alarmingly upon her,
      her father's look of blank concern, Uncle Mack's fat red
      jaws slowing down on their chewing, a little like a
      startled cow, Aunt Grace setting down a cake plate as
      though she had suddenly gone weak, Katherine's nostrils
      quivering excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Folks," Laura said, and her voice in the sudden hush
      sounded as squeaky as a worn-out phonograph record. "I want
      you all to know I've changed my mind about going East." She
      looked up at Allen's astonished face above her. "Meet the
      newest applicant for admission to the clan."
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="c31" id="c31">CHAPTER 31</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Save for the fact that a bomb would have made a splintered
      mess of the baby grand and torn unmendable cavities in the
      floor and ceiling, the effect could not have been more
      devastating. The clan all sat or stood for a moment in
      motionless attitudes, like figures dug from some ancient
      lava-covered ruins. Then their minds began to function and
      they were no longer archaeologic specimens. There was much
      talk and there was much laughter, for the Deals chronically
      ran true to form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reaction affected them all in various ways. Aunt Grace
      looked a little sheepish, as though having killed the
      canary, she was trying to draw attention away from the
      feathers by saying, "Why, Laura!" in her most didactic
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men shook Allen's hand, told him how surprised they
      were, and made trite jokes about running his head into the
      noose. To which Allen was gentleman enough to withhold the
      information that he was more surprised than they, and that
      the noose had been dangling quite out of reach until a few
      moments before. Laura's father was frankly pleased. Trib,
      usually voluble, had no words for what seemed to him a
      horribly embarrassing situation, but with no noticeable
      delay made elaborate plans for a golf course in Allen's
      west pasture. The Aunts kissed Laura and asked her
      multitudinous questions, to which she gave unintelligent
      answers. Kathie made clever and impudent remarks and
      laughed gayly at the whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise stood for a few moments as though stunned. Life was
      tumbling about her ears with a tumultuous cracking and
      breaking of well constructed plans. She loved her little
      daughter, and had tried to save her from all future
      hardships. She wanted her to be happy, had worked
      diplomatically many years for Uncle Harry Wentworth and
      Aunt Carolyn to be the prime contributors to that
      happiness. By adroit planning, the scheme had worked out
      exactly as she desired. And now it was crashing about her,
      all the intricate framework of suggestion and
      sacrifice--her painstaking work of years--blown down by a
      puff of romance no stronger than the glance of an eye or
      the touch of a hand. Romance,--how useless it was!
      Love,--how impractical! And yet, so strong they were, you
      could not argue against them, nor battle them nor defeat
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the space of a few moments, Eloise had met her Waterloo
      and her Yorktown, her Richmond and her Marne. But Eloise
      was no ordinary general handing over her sword while the
      crowd looked pityingly on. The war department missed
      something when Eloise Wentworth was born a girl. She lifted
      her head in victorious gesture, and smiled at the Deal
      clan: "Does it surprise you?" She asked sturdily. "I'm
      glad, Laura, we took this way to tell them while they're
      all here together. Trib," she turned to her son, "you take
      the car and go over home and get Laura's picture off my
      dresser,--the one in the pink formal. If we hurry, I think
      we can get the announcement in the office for the Sunday
      edition of the paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about, that although every one of the
      relatives had talked to Laura and Allen, the star of the
      day's performance and the leading man had not so much as
      uttered a syllable to each other. Laura sat with her tray
      at the edge of the dining room with one group, and Allen
      sat with his tray at the end of the living room with
      another. Sometimes, across the crowd Laura caught Allen's
      challenging eye, but she evaded it adroitly and went on
      dipping olives into the salt and spreading potato salad on
      bits of bread. But something told her to beware the Ides of
      March.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hear Allen telling some of the men of his plans
      to raze the old tumble-down Deal house behind the cedars
      and build on the same site. She could hear her mother
      informing the women that there would be lots to do, now;
      that she intended Laura to have at least eighteen sheets, a
      dozen pair of pillow cases, four tablecloths, eight lunch
      cloths, two dozen Turkish towels and four dozen tea towels.
      Her voice sounded cheerful and energetic. Laura sincerely
      admired her mother's spirit. What a good sport she was. She
      felt closer to her than she had for many months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impromptu buffet supper was over and the clan broke up.
      The Mack Deals and the Stanley Deals left for Omaha,
      accompanied by Harrison and Isabelle Rhodes. Doctor and
      Margaret Baker left for Lincoln. Kathie, Eloise and Grace
      Deal cleaned trays in the kitchen. Laura whisked steadily
      back and forth carrying dishes, with one eye cannily cocked
      for signs of the approach of any friendly enemy. But Allen
      seemed busily talking with her father and Trib. Later, when
      she looked cautiously into the living room and saw it was
      empty, with a disheveled crumby sort of appearance, she
      went over to get some crumpled paper napkins in the east
      end of the room. Quite suddenly, Allen rose up like some
      huge jack-in-the-box from a big overstuffed chair turned
      toward the fireplace. Laura whirled abruptly to leave, but
      he reached out an athletic arm and caught her. "No . . .
      you don't, young lady. I've been lying in wait for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Allen--not now. Some one will come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should worry,--a bold forward woman who kidnaps a man
      and hauls him to the altar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Allen--wasn't it <i>terrible--</i>after you said you
      were through? I think I . . . was a little crazy . . . I'll
      probably never be able to look you in the eye again." And
      she hid her scarlet face under the lapel of Allen's coat,
      until the statement began to seem fairly true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arms around her, Allen's banter and his lightness died. He
      cupped Laura's chin in the palm of his hand, and turned her
      flushed face up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was great," he said, . . . "and natural and right. I'm
      more happy and proud that you came for me than you can ever
      know or understand. But it would have turned out just this
      same way if you hadn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura raised startled eyes. "What do you mean . . . just
      the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," he kissed her sweet fresh mouth, . . . "because
      I couldn't have let you go, and was coming back to-night to
      argue it all over with you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, over the top of Allen's broad shoulder, Laura
      caught a glimpse of some one looking down at her. From
      above the fireplace a lovely lady in velvet draperies with
      pearls at her throat, and reddish-brown hair curling over
      her shoulder, gazed down from heavy-lidded eyes, her
      cupid's-bow lips smiling mysteriously as though she
      possessed the concentrated wisdom of all the ages. One
      could not conscientiously say that she seemed pleased but
      neither could one justly contend that she was annoyed and
      distressed. She merely smiled that puzzling smile as
      though, sphinx-like, she knew the secret of deep mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="c32" id="c32">CHAPTER 32</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And so Laura chose Allen as women have done from time
      immemorial. The steamer trunk and the bags were unpacked
      and Laura wrote a lengthy letter to Uncle Harry and Aunt
      Carolyn, full of explanations and excuses, which she
      suddenly tore up and substituted a brief thanks for the
      kind offer they had made her, and "what seemed to me like
      freedom to follow a career, seems now not half so important
      as freedom to follow my heart." After which, she started to
      embroider fat initials on towels, every stitch a thought,
      every thought a bit of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wheat all in and the corn not ready for the husking,
      Allen began preparation for tearing down the old Deal house
      behind the cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the old Deal home was to come down. After a half
      century of standing there in the rain and the sun and the
      wind, it was to come down to make way for Allen's fine new
      brick home. For more than fifty years it had sheltered
      humans, and now it was through, its usefulness over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carpenters began their task on the first Wednesday
      morning in September. Allen was anxious to get the work
      started so that it could be inclosed before the snows came.
      He was working with the men, and Laura went over for a
      while in the afternoon to watch the demolishing of that
      which had once been dear to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on an old tumble-down seat under the cedars,
      where she had often sat years before with her childish
      writing. Her lap was full of plan books, for Allen had
      begun the dismantling of the old, even before they had
      definitely decided on the new. For a long time she watched
      the wreckers. Sometimes she thought of her grandmother, and
      the joy that must have been hers at the building of the old
      house. Sometimes she thought of the half century of living
      under the gray old roof that had been the Deal family's.
      But most of all, she thought of her own future pleasure in
      seeing the new home go up. Occasionally she felt a sense of
      sadness, that depressing emotion which always came to her
      when anything in the way of change was to be made. Change!
      That everything eventually changes was the saddest thing in
      the world. And the pleasantest.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men was tearing off the shingles with a ripping
      sound of breaking wood. One was pulling out a rafter with a
      rending sound of creaking nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yank the shingles!</i> And the joy that had been Abbie
      Deal's when the old roof was completed. <i>Creak! Creak!
      Tear into the rafters.</i> And the happiness that had been
      the Deal children's when they saw the rafters go up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it could not be torn down completely, Laura was
      thinking. As long as there was any one left who had lived
      there or who remembered it--the old house still lived in
      their memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as I live,--you live, too . . ." the words sung
      themselves through her mind. She wished she had brought
      paper with her, but had only the plan books. So she turned
      over a page and began writing verses in scraggling
      formation along the border. As she wrote her pulse
      quickened to the pleasure of forming the phrases,--her
      blood warmed to the joy of the working. She was
      experiencing a return of the familiar sensation of
      happiness on constructing. Quite suddenly, in fancy she
      caught in the far distance a glimpse of silver wings. It
      gave her a warm thrill of gratification too deep for words.
      Immediately she knew through some inner consciousness, that
      no matter what the future would hold,--joy or sorrow,
      happiness or grief,--that no matter where life's paths
      would lead her,--through sharp and stony ways or beside
      still waters,--buried deep within her was an indestructible
      capacity to visualize a white bird flying. She might never
      get close to the way of its winging, but always there would
      be joy in lifting her eyes to the glory of its distant
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Allen coming from the back of the
      building, saw her for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to assist?" he called to her across the grassy yard,
      and as he came nearer: "It's a tough job. Strong--you never
      saw anything like it. The sturdiest old timbers . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the people who built it, Allen,--sturdy and strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the old bench which gave a warning sound of
      its decrepitude under the extra weight. "Not sorry?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not sorry," Laura answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even about the career?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed and then she sobered. "Allen,--do you know,
      I've stopped kidding myself about that. If I can't see
      stories in the lives of the people around me,--I just
      couldn't see them anywhere. If I can't see drama in
      humanity near me, I guess I couldn't detect it in humans
      far away."
    </p>
    <p>
      They both turned at the sound of a car driving into the
      yard. It was Aunt Margaret Baker from Lincoln, who stepped
      out and came across the grass, her fine gray head erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Aunt Margaret," Laura was up and across the yard to
      meet her. "How did you happen to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't want to," she said. "It's like going to a
      funeral, but the more I thought about it, the more it
      fascinated me and I couldn't stay away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen remained for a few moments and then went back to his
      work. The two sat down on the bench, and together watched
      the disruption. The creaking of nails and the splintering
      of wood were the only sounds in the sleepy summer
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted Grace to come," Margaret laughed, "but she
      wouldn't. Your Aunt Grace doesn't like to have her emotions
      disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it . . . knowledge, facts, law, order, and
      discipline make up Aunt Grace's mind," Laura said, and was
      conscience-smitten at the words. "She can't bear to have it
      all cluttered up with tag-ends of sentiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just think, Laura," Margaret Baker went on, "what the old
      house has seen . . . our childish plays and quarrels and
      sicknesses . . . Mother dragged in half dead by Christine
      Reinmueller in the big blizzard of '88 . . . Grace born a
      few hours afterward . . . your Uncle Mack, a raw country
      boy, leaving to try his fortune in Omaha . . . I, leaving
      for the Academy with my ironed-out hair and my cotton
      stockings . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Splinter! Splinter! Yank the shingles.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wedding . . . it seems like yesterday . . . and it's
      over forty years ago . . . the lane road full of wagons and
      buggies . . . Doctor and I coming downstairs . . . the
      ceremony . . . the young folks dancing on the new carpet .
      . . driving away afterward with Doctor in the June
      moonlight behind a livery team . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Creak! Creak! Tear into the rafters.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father laughing and joking with me as he went out into the
      yard . . . being brought in dead a few minutes afterward.
      Old Grandma Deal coming out from Iowa to live with Mother .
      . . Isabelle's delight over getting a piano."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Crash! Crash! Throw down the timbers.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christmas, with every one home . . . the long table . . .
      and the excitement over getting to sleep, with the packages
      all around . . . Christmases and birthdays and
      Thanksgivings. Your father leaving to get married without
      telling Mother . . . Isabelle getting married, too, in war
      times just before Harrison went to the Philippines . . .
      Grace going away . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Crumble! Crumble! Drop the chunks of old plaster.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother living alone, sturdy and brave and unselfish,
      putting every one's interest before her own . . . hearing
      that your father had gone to the Spanish-American war . . .
      saying good-by to Fred Jr. and Stanley going over seas . .
      . pottering around feebly with the old things she loved . .
      . dying all alone . . . not one of us here . . . only the
      old house of us all to shelter her that last day . . . only
      the old rooms to know whether she suffered or called for
      us. Just think, Laura, how <i>human</i> it seems . . .
      knowing everything about us . . . the hopes and the joys .
      . . the disappointments and sorrows . . . the griefs and
      the happiness . . . just <i>one</i> of us, it seems."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Splinter! Splinter! Tear at the shingles.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Creak! Creak! Jerk the rafters.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura winked back the suspicious moisture. "And yet, Aunt
      Margaret, <i>my</i> new house goes up right there on the
      very spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," Margaret Baker put a well kept hand on
      Laura's, "that was pretty thoughtless of me. Well, I guess
      that's a sign I'm getting along in years, myself,--trying
      to live over the buried past. And the new house will
      contain it all, Laura. You can't evade a thing. Those who
      try to get around it are weak. Those who meet it gallantly
      are strong. So many women try to dodge life. They don't
      economize because it's inconvenient. They don't work
      because it's tiring. They don't have a child because it's
      painful. They don't look at the dead because it's
      saddening. Face them all, Laura. Face them squarely and
      meet them gallantly . . . as your grandmother did. For
      every one of the old experiences will be there . . . birth
      . . . marriage . . . death . . . disappointment . . . grief
      . . . little joys . . . little sorrows. You'll have to meet
      them all. It's part of the story . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it . . ." Laura stood up. "Well . . . I'm ready."
      She threw out her hands in a little gesture of surrender.
      "I'm ready for them all . . . with Allen."

    <h2>
      <a name="c33" id="c33">CHAPTER 33</a>
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There are those who will say that the love story of Laura
      Deal and Allen Rinemiller ends here. But they who say it do
      not define love correctly. For though love has been
      ridiculed and disgraced, exchanged and bartered, dragged
      through the courts, and sold for thirty pieces of silver,
      the bright, steady glow of its fire still shines on the
      hearth-stones of countless homes,--the homes of which no
      one reads. For of what news value is the home from which
      there comes no tale of crime or breath of scandal? And of
      what dramatic importance is the average decent family going
      about its daily business?
    </p>
    <p>
      In time the new house was finished on the site of the old,
      and any comparison is unfair to the old one which had been
      considered spacious and comfortable in an early day. The
      new farm home was of brick and tile. Its heat came up from
      the cellar, its lights came in from Omaha, its water came
      in through many pipes. Ice was frozen in its kitchen, food
      was cooked there without sign of match or fuel, dust from
      its floor was sucked up into bags and burned. Its coffee
      was percolated from a plug in the wall, its corn was popped
      by the same unseen force, its bells rung and its water
      heated. Laura sat at her desk and talked with friends in
      their homes. Machines in her immaculate basement helped her
      wash and iron. Heat regulators kept her warm in winter.
      Fans cooled her in summer. And symphony orchestras played
      for her while she worked. Allen touched a button at the
      house and flooded the barns with light. Blooded cattle were
      in his pastures. Two automobiles were in his garage. Auto
      trucks were under their shed. His fields were furrowed by a
      giant's plow, and cultivated with the latest type machine.
      A great combine, with a few turns of its iron hands, did
      the work of a dozen men. And there was much talk of farm
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years that followed, children were born to Allen and
      Laura, so that Laura knew the price of motherhood to be
      pain and responsibility; the reward, love and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after profitable years, there came a summer when
      a drouth was upon the land. Every so often Nature strikes a
      blow of some kind at each section of the country. It is as
      though she grows tired of being unnoticed by a neglectful
      people, craves adulation, precipitates a forceful shock
      upon a prosperous community, so that the old primitive
      order of nature worship shall be restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a summer came to many of the agricultural states.
      Nature slipped back, for a time, into the parsimonious ways
      of pioneer times. Day after day the sky kept its hard blue
      glare. Only thin lines of moistureless clouds slipped
      across the sky. The creek waters went down. The grass in
      the pastures dried. Corn curled brown on the stalk. Berries
      were hard knots on the stems. Nature had turned traitor,
      was apparently in league with the eastern markets.
      Depression, like the rippling of a huge circle of water
      into which a stone had been flung, sent its out-bound waves
      through the agricultural country. Land was not moving. Cash
      renters had nothing with which to pay. Crop renters had
      little to divide with the owners. If a man could not meet
      his obligations at the bank, suddenly he found he could not
      hold his land. Farm products went for bed-rock prices.
      Wheat was so low, many farmers ground it for feed. Hogs
      sold for a song. Everything,--the last war, the tariff, the
      administration, extravagance, the eighteenth amendment, a
      fallen meteor,--was blamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nebraska did not suffer to any dangerous extent; was, in
      truth, the least hard hit of the agricultural states, but
      still there was much talk of depression. Men owed Allen
      money which he could not collect. He grew worried and
      silent. Ready cash was scarce in the Rinemiller household.
      Laura bought sparingly or not at all, in order to help tide
      affairs over the crisis. She turned and mended the
      children's clothes. She cared faithfully for her chickens,
      and saw eggs drop to ten cents a dozen, as her grandmother
      had experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all they could discuss,--the cloud under which they
      lived. Something hung over them. Something out of which
      they wanted to emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, there <i>are</i> other subjects," Allen would
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you dare to quote 'The man worth while is the man who
      can smile, when everything goes dead wrong,' I'll throw
      something at you," Laura would laugh. It took all their
      common sense and philosophy to face life these days. The
      two are synonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allen, here's a queer thing," Laura said once. "I've
      written a few stories and sold them . . . when I didn't
      need money . . . and now, that I want cash so badly . . .
      genius won't burn. I'm nervous and tense, and thinking
      about the money all the time I write . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which goes to prove, you can't buy off the Muse," Allen
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be so glad when we can get hold of some good hard
      cash, again,--money that's actually available and not all
      tied up in land. We're simply land poor, Allen. I want a
      dozen things. A new dining-room rug for one . . . bedroom
      curtains for another, and I <i>could</i> make use of a new
      dress. I'm so sick of my same hat that I've a notion to
      trim it with zinnia blossoms from the garden. They're so
      hardy I think they wouldn't wilt until I got home from
      club."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Carolyn Wentworth had died the previous year, and now
      in the midst of the depression, word came that Uncle Harry
      Wentworth had been killed in an auto accident. "Allen,"
      Laura was excited, "maybe he has left me some money. Oh,
      Allen, he would! He liked me. Just <i>imagine!"</i> Her
      cheeks were pink and her eyes were starry. "I feel it.
      Something tells me he wouldn't go back on me entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't count on it," Allen advised. But she could see that,
      in spite of himself, he had brightened visibly. Everything
      was going to be all right in a year or so, but in the
      meantime, some of Uncle Harry Wentworth's money, even a sum
      not large, could be used in a dozen ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, a few days later, came a report of Uncle Harry
      Wentworth's will--a long official envelope. Laura had a
      pair of Billy's coveralls in her lap, and as Allen brought
      in the mail, was finishing the application of a
      hexagonal-looking patch to the place which Billy invariably
      wore out from sliding down the roofs of the farm buildings.
      Allen held the letter gingerly between a thumb and
      forefinger, as he crossed to the low rocking-chair where
      Laura sat. Neither spoke. Laura's heart was in her throat,
      and she felt almost faint. So much hung on the moment.
      Uncle Harry would have remembered her. Out of all that
      money, he surely would have given her a share. In the years
      that had passed she had seldom thought of it, so absorbed
      had she been in her family life. But now, it seemed an
      almost probable gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen put the letter in her lap. She did not touch it for a
      moment. Her throat felt dry, and her fingers were without
      feeling. Just a few thousand dollars out of his wealth at
      this time of depression,--and there were a dozen things she
      could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled herself together and tore open the envelope.
      Even then, she had a swift vision of Uncle Harry flashing
      his brown eyes at the stenographer who had taken the
      original dictation of the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of the letter stood out clear and black in the
      morning sunlight. Uncle Harry Wentworth had kept his word.
      He had meant what he said. That there should be no legal
      controversy over any omission of her name, she was
      mentioned. "To my grandniece, Laura Deal Rinemiller, I give
      and bequeath the sum of one dollar."
    </p>
    <p>
      The flush slipped away from her cheek and for a moment she
      felt sick with disappointment. Suddenly, she laughed, a
      little unsteadily to be sure, but she laughed and handed
      the letter to Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen read the formal statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's that," Laura said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sorry," Allen said stoutly. "It wouldn't have been
      good for us. Money coming that way does something to
      people. It weakens something inside them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There goes our last chance for immense wealth, Allen.
      After this, it's just the same old story, 'What's the price
      of corn to-day?' 'How is the Omaha cattle market?' and
      'What are you paying for eggs, Mr. Porter?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--and you'll see, corn's going up and so are cattle,
      and the egg money isn't such a punk amount at any time.
      Just wait until agriculture comes into its own again."
      Allen was off on a favorite topic. The eternal hope!
      Three-quarters of a century before, the settlers had said:
      "You'll see, some day we'll be raising more corn than we
      can use ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      The check for the dollar came, as portentous looking with
      its executor's signature as though there had been a
      half-dozen naughts after the "one." Laura endorsed it and
      told Allen to cash it for her. "I want silver, Allen, a big
      round silver dollar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so particular?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to have a hole drilled in it and wear it around my
      neck to remind me what a heavy burden you've been to me."
      Allen grinned at her. They understood each other's various
      moods, and each knew that the other did not care deeply
      about the disappointment. It was an incident, closed now,
      with life going on as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon of that day, Allen brought the silver dollar home
      and presented it very formally to its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was soft and balmy, with a little breeze in the
      elms and poplars and great banks of cloud snow drifting
      across the sky's blue highway. In the late afternoon Laura
      called to the children and asked them if they would like to
      go down to the pasture with her and play, while she mended
      in the shade. Talking volubly, skipping and running, they
      all went with her down through the garden, past the four
      o'clocks and the cosmos, past the turnips and the fat
      cabbages, through the red raspberry patch, and came then to
      the edge of the pasture, where Laura spread out an old
      blanket and settled herself for the weekly sewing of
      buttons and the filling of large and unexpected cavities.
      But she did not work. She sat idly under the tree and
      thought of many things,--of her full life, of the hopes she
      and Allen had for the children's futures, and of her own
      plans for further writing. For never in the midst of her
      busy life had she lost sight of the distant sheen of silver
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time, the three larger children romped and
      played by the creek bed, where the low water moved
      sluggishly, and shadows lay thick under the trees--Billy
      and Phyllis and Jane. And the baby tumbled about on fat
      uncertain legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, Laura called out to them: "I've a new game
      for you, children. Do you want to try it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," they all called, and the baby who did not even know
      what they were talking about, kept repeating, "Soor--soor,"
      with moist pink mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. You are to lie down on the grass over
      there--face downward--and eyes shut tight--until I say,
      ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three threw themselves on the grass with excited
      chuckling, and the baby tripped happily over all their
      plump legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura reached in the pocket of her pink house dress and
      took out Uncle Harry Wentworth's dollar. She looked at it a
      little ruefully for a moment, lying there in the palm of
      her hand, and then she threw it far out into the pasture.
      For an instant she saw the bright flash of its circling,
      and then it settled into the brown streaked grass curing
      for the hay barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," she called, "game's ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      They hopped up and came for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out in the pasture," she told them, "is one of the most
      valuable things in the whole world. You're to look all
      around the pasture and find what you think is the most
      valuable thing out there, and then come to tell us when I
      call."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time they ran around the pasture in search of
      this most important thing, shouting to each other in the
      excitement of the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoo--hoo . . . time's up," Laura called.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all came racing in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ready . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So'm I . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So'm I . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, who goes first . . . the oldest or the ladies?"
      Laura asked. And because they were very normal youngsters,
      they all crowded around with vociferous:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me first! . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll begin at the top then, Billy . . . what do
      <i>you</i> think . . . What did you find, that was the most
      valuable thing out there in the pasture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tree . . ." Billy said unhesitatingly, "the big
      cottonwood tree that sits in the middle where the cows come
      for shade and where we play. Dad told me your Grandfather
      Deal planted a whole row for a windbreak . . . and it's the
      last one from a seedling of that old windbreak. It stands
      there so old and nice and shady . . . it made me think of
      the verses you made us learn, about:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
      But only God can make a tree.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I'll bet it's the tree, Mother. Is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe," Laura smiled. "And Phyllis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine's a meadow lark, Mother. There's a nest down in the
      grass right by a post. I <i>love</i> meadow larks. It must
      be that . . . Mother, for can you think how it would be, to
      never, <i>never</i> hear a meadow lark sing again, when
      it's all nice in the morning and summer? It's the meadow
      lark, isn't it, Mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe. And what's yours, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane, who had one hand over her mouth and was jumping up
      and down with smothered glee, said through her fingers,
      "You never could guess . . ." and then removing her hand,
      shouted at the top of her voice: <i>"The Baby.</i> It's
      true . . . Mother, he <i>was</i> out there. . . . He ran
      out once, and when I saw him toddling toward me, I knew
      right away it was the baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby, seeing he was the center of all admiration,
      suddenly became shy and ran to his mother and hid his face
      in her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in Laura's eyes. "Well, well," she said.
      "Trees, birds, babies . . . what lovely, valuable things
      you found. You were <i>all</i> right. Now we must go up to
      the house and get Father's supper . . . How do muffins
      sound to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With raisins, Mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, with raisins, Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just stuffed with 'em, Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all crowded around her, while the baby rode up on her
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen came up from the field swinging along in his giant
      stride. "Where's the parade going?" he called, and came up
      to them and took the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all went into the house, and ate muffins. And night
      came and other days. And the sun shone and the rain fell.
      The hay was cut and hauled to the barn and the pasture
      plowed. And Uncle Harry Wentworth's dollar was turned deep
      under the sod. But though the sun shone on it and the rain
      fell, nothing ever came from it,--<i>not a green thing nor
      a singing thing nor a human soul.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
