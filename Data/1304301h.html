<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; HOUSE OF LIVING
DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">ARE <i>you</i> sane?</p>

<p>Are you <i>certain</i> there is no taint in your blood, no
lurking bomb of madness in your heritage that may not explode under
sudden stress and make of you a staring-eyed
lunatic&mdash;seething, perhaps, with the passion to see red blood
spurting from arteries severed by your knife?</p>

<p>Not long ago a red bubble of rage exploded within your skull and
you wanted to smash a leering, grinning face before you; smash it
to a gory pulp. Temper, you say. Temper? Are you sure? Dead
sure?</p>

<p>Remember: a madman believes himself normal, is convinced it is
those others who are insane; those others who do not see the evil
faces he envisions, who do not hear the shuddersome, compelling
voices whispering in his ears the command to kill, <i>kill,
KILL!</i></p>

<p>Think. Think of the time you woke to deadly stillness in the
night and knew, <i>knew</i> beyond doubt that someone was in the
room, <i>something</i> that in the next horrible moment would be at
your throat, ripping the life from your quivering breast with
sharp, unhuman claws. You tried to scream for help and could not;
you could not stir a limb, a finger; and the clammy-cold sweat on
your brow was like an icy touch from Outer Darkness...After an
eternity you managed somehow to switch on your bed lamp...and
nothing was there, nothing at all. "A bad dream," you muttered,
still shaking with abysmal fear. <i>But was it a dream?</i> Were
you not awake; acutely, fearfully awake as you plumbed that hell of
causeless terror?</p>

<p>The fear of death is nothing, the fear of being buried alive a
pale, wan thing, to the uttermost horror man can face: the fear of
going insane, the fear that one <i>is</i> insane!</p>

<p><i>I know!</i>
</p>

<p>I held on to the rail as puffing little tugs bunted and hauled
the <i>San Pedro</i> into its dock at Bush Terminal. My legs still
buckled at the knees, a trip-hammer still pounded at the base of my
skull though it was three weeks since I had come to aboard the
freighter and known that I was homeward bound. Before that, I could
dimly remember a parade of reptilian horror through my cabin, dim,
vasty shapes moving through the mists that alcohol had evoked
within my soul. But I had not touched a drop aboard ship, and my
head was clear. I swear that it was.</p>

<p>Not that I was thinking. I was trying not to think. I was trying
not to remember the terse cablegram that had come to me on the
saltpeter <i>estancia</i> in the hinterland behind Iquique, the
yellow slip carrying the news of my father's sudden death, the
message that had rocked me back on my heels and set me guzzling
<i>pulque</i> to deaden the week of waiting before I could get a
boat for home. I was trying not to realize that the big house on
Fifth Avenue would be cold, and empty; that dad would not be there
to engulf my hand in his and say&mdash;as he always said on my
return from one of the earth's far places&mdash;"Hello Hal! I've
missed you. Come in and have a drink."</p>

<p>I suppose they let me guzzle to sottishness and insensibility as
the kindest way to help me through that infinite week. At any rate
it was not until the <i>Pedro</i> had been ten days at sea that I
had waked to a dreary world that no longer held the father I
adored, waked to know that I was alone, utterly alone. Small wonder
that I was still white and jittery as the <i>Pedro</i> warped in to
her berth.</p>

<p>I felt in the pocket of my jacket for a cigarette, and paper
rustled. This was the suit in which I had been carried aboard;
someone must have stuffed a last minute message into it. I pulled
out the paper. It was a radiogram.</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">IMPOSSIBLE WAIT FOR YOU STOP SEE AVERY DUNN 200
WALL STREET IMMEDIATELY ARRIVAL NEW YORK STOP FULLY EMPOWERED
SETTLE FATHERS ESTATE STOP</p>
<br>

<p>So far it made sense. But the signature gave me a jolt, the
first, but by no means the last in this weird affair. <span class=
"smcap">"Irma Kahn."</span> The name was utterly strange to me.
<i>Irma.</i> A woman's name. What on earth had a strange woman to
do with my father's estate? Dad had been almost a hermit in the
five years since mother left us, wouldn't so much as look at
another woman. And this Avery Dunn! Our attorneys were Humperdinck,
O'Ryan and Schwartz, a dry as dust firm of legal luminaries who
have long monopolized the affairs of the first families of the
metropolis.</p>

<p>I thought of looking at the dateline. My head was clear, I
repeat. The message was addressed to me at Iquique, had arrived the
day the <i>Pedro</i> sailed. It had been sent from the Liner
<i>City of Paris,</i> bound for France.</p>

<p>It was more than a year since my father had sent me down to
rehabilitate his sadly neglected <i>estancia.</i> Maybe...I crushed
the paper in my hand. No. Damn it! Dad wasn't that kind, he'd
never...</p>

<p>A gangplank rattled to a dingy, splintered pier-floor, a whistle
blasted aloft. I had to find out what this was all about, find out
as quickly as I could. I jerked around, thumped down a
companionway, and was down the gangplank before the last rope had
been fastened. My footing heaved as if it were still the
<i>Pedro</i>'s deck, but that didn't slow my sprint down the long,
dark tunnel of the covered pier. I was out in sun-glare and a
yellow cab was veering toward me across the cobbles. I lunged for
it, yelled "Wall Street. Two Hundred Wall," at the goggle-eyed
driver, and scrambled inside. He started off with a jerk that threw
me into the leather seat.</p>

<p>The lobby man looked at me rather queerly when I asked for the
number of Avery Dunn's office, but he said "Fourteen-ten," promptly
enough. There was a mirror in the elevator, and I smoothed down my
hair with the palm of my hand, got my tie around from under my left
ear. I needed a shave pretty badly, but that couldn't be helped. At
that I had to admit I was a tough-looking specimen. I stand
six-four in my stocking feet, but you've got to measure me to
realize it, because I'm built in proportion to my height. The
Porto-Rican sun had tanned me pretty near to the leathery shade of
a <i>mozo,</i> and my eyes were blood-shot and starey. I shouldn't
have liked to meet myself on a dark night.</p>

<p>The door of Fourteen-ten didn't give me much information as to
who and what Avery Dunn was. His name was down in one corner of the
frosted-glass panel, painted in neat gilt letters. And under it was
the one word, <span class="smcap"><b>AFFAIRS</b></span>. Big
letters sprawled across the glass wouldn't have conveyed half the
sense of importance those little ones did. And there was something
queerly non-committal, almost mysterious about that evasive label.
When I got the door open I decided that Mr. Dunn's "affairs" must
be manifold. Past the low railing that cut off a square around the
entrance I could see a big room, and the rattle of typewriters was
like a spigotty revolution going full blast. There must have been
two dozen girls seated at long rows of little desks, all busily
packing away. Only three or four men were visible, moving
around.</p>

<p>"Well," a snippy voice cut across my observation. "What is it?"
I jerked my eyes back to the girl who sat at the telephone desk
just beyond the railing. She was wearing some kind of black dress
with a white collar, and there wasn't too much red on her lips. But
her eyes were insolent. "What do <i>you</i> want?"</p>

<p>The muscles under my ears hardened a bit, but I answered, mildly
enough, "Mr. Dunn. My name is Harold Armour."</p>

<p>Her face changed when I said it. Something came into it, not
fright, but something akin to it. "Harold Armour," she repeated, I
thought unnecessarily loudly. She thrust a plug into one of the
holes in front of her and said, "Mr. Harold Armour to see you, Mr.
Dunn...Yes sir." Then to me: "You are to go right in sir. Straight
back." She readied out a hand to swing open the gate in the railing
beside her.</p>

<p>I looked at the opening and, quite unreasonably, hesitated a
moment. Was some obscure sixth sense warning me of danger? Or were
the first crawling worms of madness waking in my brain? At any
rate, the prickling across the nape of my neck subsided almost
immediately and I strode through, pounding stiff-legged toward the
line of partitioned-off small offices at the back of the big
room.</p>

<p>Even then there was nothing wrong with my observation, with the
keen functioning of my thoughts. I can call up the face of each
typist who flicked a quick glance at me as I passed; can spot on a
diagram the position of every one of the male clerks. I can sketch
for you, even now, the way the door of Dunn's office was set back
in an embrasure made by two large square pillars, placed unusually
close. But I did jerk that door open with uncalled-for violence and
slam it shut behind me.</p>

<p>I SHOT a quick glance around the little room I had entered. If
you spend much time in the outlands you get that habit; going into
unfamiliar places your life may depend on a knowledge of every
small item of your surroundings. And so I am certain, dead certain,
of what I saw&mdash;<i>or thought I saw.</i></p>

<p>The wall to my left, some ten feet long, was lined with
book-laden shelves. So was the one to my right, except that at its
further end the line of shelving was broken by a door. I noticed a
diagonal scratch across the bronze key-plate of that door.
Afterwards I clung frantically to the memory of that scratch,
pictured it again and again as I battled with horror. Over and
over, a thousand times or more, I asked myself if any dream, any
hallucination, could be as detailed as that.</p>

<p>Opposite me a window let light flood in on a massive desk that
dwarfed the little man seated behind it. Avery Dunn was looking
straight at me, his sallow face an expressionless mask. There was
something faintly Mongolian about his features; a vague heightening
of the cheekbones, an almost imperceptible slanting of the eyelids.
And there was a peculiarly alien liquidity in his precise
enunciation as he said, "I am glad you came directly from the ship,
Mr. Armour."</p>

<p>My long legs took me across the space between us in two strides,
but I didn't take the chair the movement of his pupils indicated.
Oh, I know my behavior was boorish&mdash;outrageous. But remember
that my parched system was clamoring for the alcohol it had been
denied for nearly a month after a prolonged debauch. My actions
were ill-mannered, perhaps, but not abnormal. <i>Not abnormal!</i>
I put my fists knuckles down on the desk's glass top and thrust out
my jaw. "How the devil do you know," I rumbled, "that the <i>San
Pedro</i> just docked? We are a day ahead of schedule. Who are you
anyway? Who is Irma Kahn? What have the two of you to do with my
father's estate?"</p>

<p>Dunn looked me over imperturbably, his narrow, glittering eyes
like those of a biologist examining some new, not particularly
interesting, specimen. "Irma Kahn," he said at length, "is the
executrix of your father's estate. I am her business adviser." I
think it was his utter indifference, his lack of resentment at my
intolerable brusqueness, that inflamed me further.</p>

<p>"Where the hell do you come in?" I shouted at him. "I've never
heard of you in my life, or the Kahn woman either. There's some
monkey business here, and, by God, I'm going to find out what it is
before I'm many hours older!"</p>

<p>I might have uttered some banality for all my bellow seemed to
affect him. "I can quite understand your surprise," he responded
very calmly, "and even your attitude. I expected both and prepared
for them." His hands, their fingers curiously stubby, made a tent
on the desk before him. "Irma Kahn is...."</p>

<p>"Hal! Hal Armour," a muffled, insistent voice husked from my
right. "Hal!" I wheeled, stared at the inner door in the side wall
from behind which the sound seemed to come. "Hal! Watch out!
<i>Watch out!</i>"</p>

<p>My jaw dropped, lax. Who could be calling to me here, using my
first name? <i>Who was behind that door?</i></p>

<p>"Hal! He's a..." the husked words were suddenly unintelligible,
crescendoed into a mute shriek, and cut off. Came again. "Help!
Help!" I lunged for the door, got my hand on its knob, flung it
open and plunged through. I was in a long, narrow room. A man, his
back to me, was struggling with another whose face I could not see.
A metallic flash whizzed past my ear! A knife, thrown from behind
me, plunged into the man's back. I saw blood spurt and I whirled to
the menace from the rear. Dunn was out in front of his desk, his
arm was raised. A second knife was in his hand, held by the
weighted handle and poised for the throw that would plunge it in my
own back. Steel springs uncoiled in my legs and I leaped straight
for him, grabbing for the black hilt of that knife. I caught it,
snatched it away...</p>

<p><i>"Mahoutma alloy! Stoot!"</i> The gibberish was a squealed
command from my left. I twisted to it; saw...great heavens...saw a
towering black giant stark-naked, crouching just within the closed
outer door. His face was an appalling spectacle of demoniac
savagery and in his ebony hand a perfectly civilized automatic
snouted at <i>me!</i></p>

<p>Something crashed against the base of my skull, the world
exploded in whirling coruscations of fire, and oblivion swept
in...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; SCREAMING FACES</h2>

<p class="first">MY HEAD was a swelling balloon of agony as I
weltered up toward consciousness through oceans of pain-shot
blackness. I heard <i>my</i> own name spoken in Dunn's liquid,
foreign voice. "&mdash;Harold Armour, whose father's estate I am
managing. He burst in here shouting accusations at me and when I
tried to placate him he attacked me with that knife. Luckily this
heavy seal was on my desk and I managed to knock him out with it
before he did any damage."</p>

<p>"Lucky is right," a gruff voice responded. "That's a wicked
blade, and he's big enough to split you in two with it."</p>

<p>I struggled to open my eyes. Hands were fumbling at me, a
pungent odor stung my nostrils and something wet dribbled along my
lips. Some of the fluid got into my throat and I swallowed
convulsively. There was a minor explosion in my chest and my lids
popped wide. A pink face was over mine. It had a little blonde
mustache and was topped by a blue cap with a red cross embroidered
above the visor. I tried to get up, found my arms were being held
by iron fingers. My head jerked sidewise, I saw the glowering
features of a clerk who had leered at me as I came through the
outer office. "Easy," the ambulance surgeon said gently. "Take it
easy, old man, and you'll be all right."</p>

<p>A squirrel was chasing its tail inside my skull, but my vision
cleared a little and I could see, beyond the doctor, a policeman
talking to Dunn. "Grab that man," I mourned. "Arrest him! He's a
murderer!"</p>

<p>The cop grinned, infuriatingly, and took a step that brought him
above me as I lay on the floor. "That's all right," he chuckled.
"You just calm down an' let the doc take care of you."</p>

<p>I forgot the throbbing pain in my head. "You damn fool," I
howled, fighting to get away from the hands holding me down.
"You...ass! It was Dunn killed the man inside, he tried to kill me,
and you're letting him get away with it!"</p>

<p>The officer's eyes narrowed and his thick fingers moved along
his nightstick. But the hospital man straightened and whispered
something in his ear. The cop grinned and nodded. "What man?" he
asked, more smoothly. "Inside where?"</p>

<p>"For the love of God!" I grunted. "The dead man in that room." I
rolled; somehow the fellow holding me had relaxed his grip; started
to point, started to say "Behind <i>that</i> door." And did
neither!</p>

<p><i>There was no door in the wall back of me!</i> The shelves
stretched solidly to the window! The door through which I had
lunged to the unknown's cry for help had vanished! There was no
sign, absolutely no sign, that an opening had ever existed in that
book-lined wall!</p>

<p>I felt my eyes widen, heard myself gasp.</p>

<p>"There was a door," I shrieked. "There <i>was</i> a door
there!"</p>

<p>"Sure," the physician said soothingly. "Sure there was a door
there. But it isn't there any longer. Now you be a good fellow and
let me take you to the hospital. <i>Our</i> doors stay put."</p>

<p>My stomach turned over as I realized that he was humoring me.
Great heavens above! Dunn had made them think I was insane!</p>

<p>The thought sobered me. I must be careful, shrewd. I must match
his guile with my own.</p>

<p>"All right, Doctor," I muttered very calmly. "All right. I'll go
with you. But you'd better take the black man with you too. He
might hurt somebody with his gat."</p>

<p>"Hell!" the cop grunted. "He's batty as a loon."</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, Rafferty," the medico snapped. "I'll do all the
talking." His blue eyes were shining with interest. "I want to find
out just what he thinks he saw." Then, to me, "Who's this black man
you're talking about, pal?"</p>

<p>"The fellow without any clothes that pulled a gun on me," I
answered, talking slowly and carefully. "He couldn't get away
without someone's seeing him."</p>

<p>"No, he couldn't get away." The man in the white coat smiled,
and turned his head. "Anybody see a naked black man around here
with a gun?"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of "no's," and for the first time I saw the
staring-eyed girls crowding the door from the outer room. Fright
mingled with morbid curiosity, on most of the white faces, but I
saw pity in the eyes of one pert-featured minx. And somehow that
pity made me cold, suddenly, cold all over.</p>

<p>"No one could have come into or out of this office without all
of us seeing him," another girl said, her voice shrill with
excitement. "We all know Mr. Dunn was alone in here till this man
barged in, and nobody went in after him."</p>

<p>There was a general murmur of assent. "I heard him shouting at
Mr. Dunn,"&mdash;the clerk who was holding me offered, "and I was
just coming over when there was a crash and the boss yelled for
help. I was the first one in. Those two were the only ones to be
seen, and nobody could have gotten past me without my knowing
it."</p>

<p>The floor rocked under me. They couldn't <i>all</i> be in a
conspiracy against me! There was no door in the side-wall, there
had been no naked negro! Great God! Were they right? Was
I...<i>insane?</i></p>

<p>"Hell, Doc," the patrolman growled. "Let's get it over with.
Let's put the nut in the wagon and get going."</p>

<p>I remembered the scratch on the door-plate. Tiny thing that it
was, it steadied me, gave me infinitesimal hope to which to cling.
I couldn't have imagined that, I told myself. I tried to keep my
voice even. "Doctor," I said. "Doctor. I know it looks bad for me.
But will you do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"What is it, old man?" Bless him! He was convinced I was a
madman, a homicidal maniac. But he was kindness itself, his voice
gentle. May his tribe increase.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see what's behind this wall before you take me
away."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he responded. "I'd like you to. Maybe if you see
how impossible it is for the things you imagine to have really
happened it will help us to cure you."</p>

<p>At a word from the surgeon my captor released me. I was sore all
over as I staggered to my feet. The burly clerk closed in on one
side of me, the cop on the other, and we moved to the door. The
girls scattered as we came toward them.</p>

<p>Dunn himself opened the door of the office on the right of his
own. I looked in, and my legs were suddenly water-weak. The
apparently unused room was utterly unfamiliar. Although I had only
glimpsed that in which I had seen a man killed, I knew this could
not possibly be the same. I had looked possibly twenty feet ahead
of me into that one, this was only some seven wide. There was no
break in the painted expanse of the wall on the left. And there, in
a line with those in Dunn's chamber, were windows through which the
sun was streaming...</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" the medico asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes," I forced past the lump in my throat. "Take me away."</p>

<p>A black mist formed in front of my eyes and I swayed, clutching
the cop's arm to keep from falling. "Come on," the policeman
grunted.</p>

<p>"Wait," Avery Dunn said smoothly. "What are you going to do with
him?"</p>

<p>"Take him to the psychopathic ward at Bellevue. I suppose he'll
go to Manhattan State Hospital on the Island after a couple of
days."</p>

<p>An icy shiver swept over me. Bellevue! The Island!</p>

<p>Dunn's reply came dully to my ears. "I should like to arrange
that he go to a private sanitarium. I am in charge of his father's
estate and there is plenty of money to give him the best of
care."</p>

<p>The interne looked gratified. "That can be done," he said
heartily. "But he'll have to be certified by two lunacy
commissioners and committed by a judge. You'd better let me take
him to Bellevue till the red tape is unwound."</p>

<p>The vertigo with which I was struggling eased a bit, and I
watched Dunn warily. One corner of his thick mouth twitched a bit
and a film seemed to drop over his Oriental eyes. "I have some
influence," he smiled. "It won't take me long to get things fixed
up."</p>

<p>A blood-freezing thought flared into being at the back of my
tortured brain. In a public institution I should have some chance
to prove, to myself and to others, that I was not insane. In a
private asylum I should be utterly in the power of the evil-faced
Dunn, utterly without hope. "No," I croaked. "No. I want to go with
you, Doctor. Take me away with you."</p>

<p>The young fellow turned and patted me on the shoulder. He had to
reach up to do so. "Don't be foolish, buddy," he said in the tone
one used to a willful child. "If you knew what I do about the
Island you'd appreciate the break you're getting."</p>

<p>My biceps swelled and my heart pounded. They thought me mad and
would pay no attention to what I wanted! Dread closed in on me,
quivering, black dread. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps I
<i>was</i> a lunatic&mdash;a knife-wielding, murderous maniac. No!
I thought of something. The knife with which I was supposed to have
attacked Dunn! Where had that come from? I had no weapon of any
kind when I left the <i>Pedro.</i> "Damn it!" I bellowed. "Don't
talk to me like that. I'm being framed. I'm not crazy, I'm as sane
as you are!"</p>

<p>The cop's fingers tightened on my wrist. "That's what they all
say," he chortled with the unholy glee of the sane in the presence
of the unbalanced. "All these nuts think there's a plot against
them."</p>

<p>It was as if his ham-like fist had pounded against my jaw. I
rocked back on my heels and the room swung dizzily around me.
Faces, faces everywhere leered at me, and all about hundreds of
fingers pointed in derisive scorn. An unhuman, horrible voice
shrilled, "He's crazy! Hal Armour's crazy," broke into a cackle of
triumphant laughter that echoed and re-echoed in vast spaces. Other
voices shrieked and bellowed, roared and screamed, "Crazy! Crazy!
Hal Armour's crazy!" and the pandemonium was threaded by the
squealing gleeful laughter of insensate fiends.</p>

<p>I crouched, suddenly, and sprang, twisting as I leaped. My
wrists tore from the grasp of my captors and I was free. Someone
got a hand on my shoulder, I whirled and crashed a blow to a blond
mustache on a pink face. I hurdled a desk, and dashed down a long
aisle as screaming women scattered before me. Someone in an alpaca
coat, pig-like eyes glittering, loomed in front of me and my fist
flailed out.</p>

<p>He was down and I had leaped his sprawled body. I stumbled and
crashed against wood. Ink spilled and papers flew through the air.
I saw the railing in front of me, glimpsed the insolent-eyed
telephone girl with her mouth wide open and her face fish-belly
gray. I thumped into the flimsy barrier, it splintered with a
rending crash, and I saw the girl throw something, her earphones,
at me. I dodged them, but the wires tangled around me. I plunged on
in my bull-like rush, the phone switchboard dragged after me. I
stopped to rip the cords away, and someone grabbed me from behind.
I twisted to him, bellowing, and fists flew at me from every side.
Tugging hands pulled my feet from under me and I crashed to the
floor. Sweaty bodies piled atop me, swarmed over me. I was pinned
down, helpless.</p>

<p>"Don't hurt him," the doctor's voice sounded thinly through the
roaring in my ears. "Don't hurt him more than you can help."</p>

<p>A hand fumbled at my wrist, twisted it. I felt the sharp sting
of a hypodermic needle and liquid being forced into a vein.
Blackness spread swiftly through my arteries, reached my
brain...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; WHIPS FOR THE MAD</h2>

<p class="first">I OPENED my eyes. The ceiling above me was
enameled a shining white and shadow-lines made a checkered pattern
on it. Slowly I became conscious that I was parched, and that
excruciating pain pounded in my head. I lifted a hand...tried to
lift a hand to it but could not! Queer, I though, mighty queer. But
my head hurt too much for me to raise it and see why.</p>

<p>Coarse cloth was under and over me, rasping my skin. That was
strange too. They had taken my clothes from me, and I was lying
stark naked on a bed. My tongue filled my mouth, and my face, my
neck, ached dully. Something pressed heavily on my chest and other
weights rested across my thighs.</p>

<p>I heard a door open. "You've come to, eh!" a grating voice said.
"About time."</p>

<p>"I want my clothes," I said, and turned my head toward him.</p>

<p>The fellow filled the doorway. His swarthy face was like a
troglodyte's, low-browed and heavy-jawed. My skin prickled as I saw
that he held in one hairy hand a short, thick-lashed whip, black
and snakelike. Good Lord! The walls were covered with gray, heavily
quilted canvas! "Get your clothes, is it?" He growled through thick
lips. "Wait till the doc sees yuh."</p>

<p>"The doc!" Memory hit me like a trip-hammer and horror closed
around me once more. "Where am I?" I gasped. "In God's name where
am I?"</p>

<p>The man leered. "Yuh'll find out quick enough." There was
lip-licking gloating in the way he said it. "Too quick." The door
slammed behind him, and I saw that it, too, was shrouded with
quilted canvas. Saw also that no handle broke its surface.</p>

<p>Now I was thoroughly alarmed. I strained to sit up, and found it
impossible. But my struggles dislodged the sheet covering me, and,
forcing my head up, I saw that those were not weights on my chest
and my thighs. They were broad webbed bands tightly stretched
across my torso. My wrists were bound to the stout iron sides of
the bed on which I was stretched and the one narrow window was
covered with steel bars! Almighty God! I was strapped to a cot in
the very center of a padded cell!</p>

<p>A scream formed itself in my throat, ripped to the surface. But
I choked it back in time, throttled it to the merest whimper. I
must not&mdash;something deep in my brain told me&mdash;I must not
again act the lunatic they thought me. I must hold a tight grip on
myself, do nothing that a sane, an utterly sane man, would not do.
To do otherwise would be to play into their hands, into the hands
of that slant-eyed, yellow-faced devil whose machinations had
placed me here. Already I had muffed one chance at thwarting him.
My blood ran cold as I realized that, remembering what the
pink-faced interne had said. Two lunacy commissioners and a judge
must have already decided that I was insane. Otherwise I would not
be here!</p>

<p>"Watch yourself, Hal Armour," I muttered, half-aloud. "They
can't keep you here forever if you behave. No more tantrums, no
more scrapping. Don't give them another chance to say that you're
crazy."</p>

<p>Great Jumping Jehoshaphat! I was talking to myself! I stared,
fear-ridden, at the shadow of the bars on the ceiling. Were they
right? Was I...a madman?</p>

<p>Was this only a lucid moment, a glimpse of sanity from the
twilight land of madness in which I was doomed to wander
forevermore? I licked dry lips and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well! So we've decided to take an interest in
life." I turned to the chuckling voice. The short, roly-poly man
coming through the door was the epitome of cheerfulness. "Jim Rand
tells me you want your clothes." He rubbed hands together, and the
fat rolls that were his cheeks lifted to a delighted smile. "We'll
see. We'll see."</p>

<p>The guard I had seen before followed the newcomer into the room,
carrying a chair. He put it at my bedside and retreated, but I
noticed that he went only as far as the door. There he leaned
against the jamb, glowering at vacancy and swishing his whip
against his pants leg. The fat little man sat down, fumbled for my
wrist with his flabby fingers. He made clucking noises at the back
of his throat, for all the world like a hen scratching up worms for
its brood, and then exploded into speech again. "We might as well
get acquainted," he said, and giggled. "I'm Doctor Helming, Dr.
Ottokar Helming. And you are Harold Armour."</p>

<p>"That's one thing I'm sure of," I responded, fighting to keep
hysteria out of my voice. "But I'd like to know where I am."</p>

<p>Helming vented his school-girlish giggle again. "He, he. Very
good. One thing you're sure of. Very good indeed. I see that we're
going to get along. And your pulse is quite normal. Remarkable.
Most remarkable." His hand left my wrist, travelled to my eyelids
and pulled them back. "Pupils clear too." His fingers felt
peculiarly cold and clammy against my skin.</p>

<p>"What is this place, Doctor?" I repeated my question, quite
calmly.</p>

<p>He pursed his tiny red mouth. "This place?" he chuckled. "A very
fine place indeed. A very fine place." He waved his palm across my
face, close to it. "Reflexes in order. You're in good shape, Mr.
Armour. In good shape."</p>

<p>"Where am I?" I said again testily, then, bit my lip. That was
his game, of course. He was testing me, trying to get me angry.
Trying to get me to flare into rage once more. Well, I'd fool him.
"Not that it matters much. I don't suppose I shall have to give the
address to very many taxi drivers."</p>

<p>Helming fairly chortled at that. "Heh, heh, heh. A comedian. A
veritable comedian. No, my dear fellow, your taxi rides will be
limited for a long time to come." His horrible touch stroked along
my biceps, down my flanks. "What muscles," he cackled. "What
beautiful muscles!"</p>

<p>My skin crawled under the slug-like fell of those gelid fingers.
The fellow in the doorway watched with slitted eyes. He cracked his
whip and the lash seemed to flick my raw nerves. I jumped inwardly.
There was more than threat in the act, there was sadistic yearning,
a vile eagerness to sense the crash of that black
thong&mdash;against flesh, to hear the howl of its human
victim.</p>

<p>The doctor must have sensed my thought, for he simpered. "Don't
be afraid&mdash;of that whip, my boy. You needn't be afraid of
anything here... if you behave."</p>

<p>"How about giving me a chance to behave," I ventured. "How about
letting me get up?"</p>

<p>The doctor's lips made a little red O. "Hmm. Hmm. Do you think
it's wise, son? Do you think it's wise?"</p>

<p>I tried to catch his eyes, those eyes, that were like blue dots,
in a pink-white ocean of fat. "I don't want to instruct you in your
profession," I said slowly, "but it would be wiser to let me get up
than to keep me lying here. If I'm strapped to this bed much longer
I'll be a raving lunatic."</p>

<p>"Haw!" Rand spluttered. "Haw haw."</p>

<p>Helming looked at me, and a curious change came over his round
face. Good humor fled from it; it was bleak, somehow terrifying.
"You're not thinking of playing any tricks on me, are you? Are
you?" Lines suddenly appeared at his mouth corners, deep lines of
cruelty. "Because it won't get you anywhere. Not anywhere at
all."</p>

<p>Can you imagine a round-faced, roly-poly fiend? That was what he
looked like, then. A short, fat devil whose belly would quiver with
delight as he watched a damned soul fry in the bottom-most pit of
hell. "No, I don't like anyone who plays tricks on me, and when I
don't like them," the words dripped from his little mouth,
"it's...just...too...bad."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I behave?" I said mildly. "Will it get me
anything if I don't?"</p>

<p>The momentary change in the fat man's appearance vanished, the
amused twinkle returned to his eyes. "Fine," he chuckled, rubbing
his pudgy hands together. "Splendid!"</p>

<p>He heaved from his chair, seeming no taller on his columnar legs
than when he had been seated. "Jim," he turned to the guard. "I can
see that Mr. Armour is going to be one of our star patients. Get
him his clothing and give him a good room. Sixteen is vacant, I
think." His insensate giggle was infuriating. "When he is ready,
call me." He toddled to the door and vanished.</p>

<p>Rand came into the room and stood above me, his eyes cold flame.
"The doc's good-natured today," he rumbled. "Lucky for you. But
don't let that pep yuh up too much." He pulled the flexible length
of his whip lovingly through, his fingers. I saw certain crusted
brown stains on it and shuddered. "Don't let it give yuh
ideas."</p>

<p>I stared at the remnants of the meal Rand had brought to Room
Sixteen and tried to fight off the black despair that rested on me
like a pall. The food had been good enough, but cut small, it had
been served on paper plates with a paper spoon. These now lay on
the upper one of two shelves set in a recess in the white enameled
wall. A comb and brush, fashioned of papier-mâché, that were shoved
to one side showed that this shelving was intended to be a dresser.
I had eaten standing, for the only chair was bolted to the door
next to a cot, also fastened in place, whose iron bars were welded
at their joinings. These were the cubicle's only furnishings, and
worst of all, a stout steel grating covered a small window so high
up that I could not look out through it.</p>

<p>My eyes wandered to the door. The surface it presented to me was
blank; no knob, no key-plate, showed on its smooth surface. The
barrier opened outward, I had noted, and there was nothing on the
inner side by which the room's occupant could manipulate the latch.
Simply, ingeniously, that door was locked against escape while it
gave ready access to anyone wishing to enter.</p>

<p>I tried to put a hand in my pocket for a cigarette, the fingers
stubbed against cloth and I recalled that, although my own suit had
been returned to me, cleaned and neatly pressed, every pocket-slit
was sewed closed with strong thread: Somehow that little incident,
more than anything else, brought home my situation.</p>

<p>I groaned. I was a man condemned as insane; imprisoned,
helpless. Doomed to living death! A cold shudder ran through me.
And then a sound twisted me to the door, a muffled scream from
somewhere outside, far off. A woman's scream! My blood
curdled...and then I remembered where I was. My fisted hands
unclenched, but I quivered to the anguish in that scream. It came
again louder, nearer; there was the patter of running feet; the
thud of heavier, following ones. Something thumped against my door,
the knob rattled, the door ripped open and someone was plunging
through. I had one glimpse of a fear-distorted face, of
golden-glinting, disheveled hair, of a white shoulder against which
red marks of a gripping hand blazed, and the girl swept past me,
shrieking. Rand plunged into the room, his face contorted and black
with fury, his whip whistling in his hands. "Got you, you
she-devil," he snarled. "Got you!"</p>

<p>"Save me," the girl shrilled. "Oh save me!"</p>

<p>I grabbed at the keeper, got my hands on his arm. "Wait!" I
cried. "Wait a minute." This was a woman after all, a girl. I
forgot that she must be mad. "Stop it!"</p>

<p>His whip lashed at me, stung across my cheek. "Out of my way,"
Rand bawled. "Out of my way, <i>loony.</i>"</p>

<p>The epithet ripped my good resolutions to tatters. My fist came
up. He ducked it, leaped sideways. I lunged at him&mdash;he whirled
with lightning swiftness. I saw the lash&mdash;off-balance I could
not dodge&mdash;it crashed across my face, searing like the sting
of a scorpion.</p>

<p>I staggered&mdash;lunged again. And again he avoided my blow
with an agility belaying his hulking body, again the black whip
slashed across my face, cutting knife-like. It crashed me to the
floor.</p>

<p>The girl shrieked! I exploded to my feet, landed a fist
somewhere on him with all the frenzied strength I could put into
the blow. It rocked him, but his wrist flicked and his whip
whistled, curled around my waist. It flung me away from him, threw
me headlong across the room. I thumped into the girl, she sprawled
across the cot, and I fell over her. I felt her warm body under me,
even in that moment I sensed the sweet redolence of her breath. But
I lifted, bounded back at Rand, whimpering with rage. I ducked his
whiplash and got another blow home. The impact jarred my elbow to
the shoulder, but he shook his head, jumped back, and launched
another whizzing slash.</p>

<p>I saw only his swarthy face in a red mist, and the black
striking snake of his devilish weapon. It was everywhere, slashing
at me, cutting my face, my arms, hurling me from side to side with
terrific force. I tried to reach his face with my fists, connected
once, once only. I might as well have battered at a marble statue.
I heard someone shrieking obscenities in a shrill, crazed
voice&mdash;knew it was myself. I knew dimly my face was wet with
blood, my chin dripping with it. Rand's lips were retracted in a
bestial snarl displaying rotted, yellow fangs, and lurid lights
crawled in his black eyes. The whip cracked again across my
head...</p>

<p>Somewhere in the darkness into which I fell endlessly a girl
screamed with terror, with unutterable fear...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; SHANG!</h2>

<p class="first">SOMEONE was sponging my head with freezing water.
I beat up towards consciousness as the blankness within my skull
pulsated with an agony not wholly physical. Voices penetrated to
me, Dr. Helming's insane giggle, Rand's gruff rumble. "I don't let
no loony make a pass at me like that." There was sadistic
satisfaction in the guard's throaty growl.</p>

<p>"But you want to be more careful, Jim. Look at the mess you made
of him. Suppose you'd killed him?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I had? Wouldn't be the first." That was a pleasant
thought.</p>

<p>"No. But Avery Dunn sent him in. I didn't get a chance to tell
you that before." The doctor's tones were meaningful.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah!" I heard, could almost see, Rand's thick lips smack
"He's one of Dunn's is he? Say, I'm getting sick of handling that
guy's pets with kid gloves. There's that damn girl, and the old guy
in Twenty-four. I could of smashed him in the puss this morning,
crabbing about his food."</p>

<p>A hardness came into Helming's voice, a savage note that
reminded me of the demoniac savagery I had seen in his little eyes
not long before. "Lay off him, Jim, let him alone. That's our ace
in the hole if Dunn and his woman get a yen to double-x us."</p>

<p>"All right. All right. But if it's gonna be lay off this one and
that one there ain't gonna be no more fun around this joint."</p>

<p>Helming chuckled. "There will be fun enough to suit you. I just
got a tip the State inspectors are coming through in a week to
check up on all commitments."</p>

<p>My heart leaped. If there was to be an inspection, a check-up, I
should have a chance to prove my sanity. I must watch my every
move. It was my chance, my only chance and I would not throw it
away. "Oh yeah," Rand growled. "We gotta work quick then."</p>

<p>"Damn quick. But leave it to me...and Shang. Say! This bird is
still out. If he doesn't wake up in two shakes I'll have to give
him a shot."</p>

<p>"Gawd, Doc, that stuff's powerful. If his heart ain't so
good..."</p>

<p>That was enough for me. I groaned, let my eyelids flicker and
come open. Helming's round face was over mine. It beamed. "Ah, my
dear fellow," he giggled. "Feeling better I hope. Feeling better?
Ready to be a good boy?"</p>

<p>I let terror show in my eyes. "Yes," I moaned. "Yes. Anything.
Anything except that damn whip." I shuddered visibly, looked around
as if in fear. But the girl wasn't there. Rand was on the other
side of my cot, his stubby fingers clutching the whip handle. I
whimpered as my eyes lit on it, cowered away.</p>

<p>"Steady, my boy." Helming put his hand on my shoulder, where the
whip had ripped my jacket sleeve, and it felt like a clammy-cold
dead thing. "Steady." He clucked. "You don't have to be afraid of
that thing if you behave."</p>

<p>I bit my lips. "But he was going to hit the girl, Doctor. He was
going to hit the girl with it and I couldn't stand for that. Could
I?"</p>

<p>"Chivalrous," he simpered. "Very chivalrous. But you must
remember where you are. This is a sanitarium for mental diseases,
you know, and some of our...er...guests must be handled like
children. They must be chastised you know, for their own good. For
their own good, more in sorrow than in anger."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said while my eyes called him a liar as I remembered
the lust to inflict pain that had distorted Rand's face. "I
understand now. I forgot for the moment where I was. I am
sorry."</p>

<p>Helming chuckled. "Do you hear that, Jim? He is sorry. Mr.
Armour apologizes and he will give you no more trouble. I told you
he would be a good patient. I told you so."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Rand said, and licked his lips. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"If you are up to it, my boy," the physician continued
cheerfully, "I should like to take you on a tour of the
establishment. You will understand better then why we are forced to
apparently severe methods at times. Only apparently severe, of
course."</p>

<p>I struggled to a sitting posture on the bed. "Come on," I said
weakly. "Come on." That was what I wanted. Like a cat in a strange
house I wanted to know my surroundings, every nook and corner of
it. And I had another reason for assenting to a tour of inspection,
unacknowledged even to myself.</p>

<p>I wanted to see the girl again, the girl with the streaming,
golden hair and the eyes that were blue as the sea at dusk.</p>

<p>Rand was on one side of me as we left the room, Helming on the
other. A long, dim corridor was lined by numbered doors. We moved
toward a flight of stairs across the head of which a steel-barred
gate stretched, ceiling-high, and we paused a moment while Rand
fumbled a key into its lock.</p>

<p>Sound came up to me through that stair-well, a mumble of sound
that was somehow unclean. There were human voices in it, strangely
distorted; and there were other noises, that might have been animal
mewlings or the gibberings of...only the Lord knows what! And with
the sound came an odor, the fetid stench of unwashed bodies, of
beings whose control of their bodily functions had gone with the
darkening of their minds. An odor that had something in it of the
grave, something of the jungle...an odor that clung to my nostrils
all the nightmare time I was in that House of Hell, that affronts
my nostrils still.</p>

<p>Rand's key scraped in the lock, the gate swung open. We passed
through, the steel clanged shut behind us. The staircase curved so
that it veiled that to which we descended, but already a cold
shiver of gruesome anticipation rippled up my spine.</p>

<p>"Beyond the Alps lies Italy," someone boomed sepulchrally.
"Forward, my men." We came around the last curve of the stairs, I
heard the smack of an open-handed slap on flesh, and a lisping,
sexless voice said, "Thank you, kind sir. Your caretheth are motht
welcome." I could see nothing, at first, but a big room, vaguely
lighted by barred windows, high up, a room filled with a seething,
tumultuous throng. A dog barked, realistically, and from a far
corner came the "Hoink, hoink," of a rooting sow. Underneath the
tumult a monotonous moan murmured, "The bugs are biting me. One,
two, three, four. The bugs are biting me. Five, six, seven,
eight."</p>

<p>Helming's touch on my arm halted me at a point of vantage. "How
do you like my pets," he whispered. "Aren't they sweet?" His hands
went back to their eternal dry-washing. "As pretty a collection as
you will find in any asylum this side of Charcot's in Paris." He
giggled, complacently.</p>

<p>My vision cleared, individual figures began to define
themselves, faces that belonged to some weird dream. Here was one
without a forehead, eyes bulging as if they would drop from their
sockets at the slightest touch. There someone crouched on a long
stool, his head an enormous dome that overbalanced a wizened body
from which it seemed to have sapped all nourishment. He looked
steadily into the distance, and the sorrow lining his unhuman
visage might have been for all the woes of the world since time
began. A wild laugh rang out from a far corner. My burning glance
twitched to the maker of the sound, and I saw an expressionless
countenance whose pallid skin was so tightly drawn, whose lips were
so far retracted and eye-sockets so deeply sunk that it was a
veritable death's-head, a living skull that laughed on and on, with
a soul-shaking horrible cachinnation that held no humor and no
thought.</p>

<p>There were other unmoving figures in that obscene gallery, other
shapes distorted almost beyond human semblance, other creatures
lost in nightmare phantasm, other amorphous shapes that sat or
stood, or sprawled on the filth-strewn floor weighed down by a
black melancholy whose utter woe showed in their very stillness.
But they were by far not the worst.</p>

<p>This shrieking little man with the big head who darted crazily
from side to side of the great hall, his face twisted with terror,
his shrill voice screaming, "Eyes, eyes. They're tearing out my
eyes!" as he turned, snarling, at each wall and clawed invisible
pursuers...</p>

<p>And now I realized that these were not all men here, that there
were women, women and girls, intermingled in the gibbering throng.
Women among these madmen! Shadowy bulks in dark corners
disentangled themselves before my reeling vision...</p>

<p>I reached out for support to the wall. This was hell, worse than
hell! It was a Doréesque vision of umbrous horror, a Dantean Hades,
a scene at describing which the pen of Victor Hugo himself might
have faltered. The man that permitted it&mdash;this jelly-like,
giggling man at my side, must himself be a monster. My fists
clenched, I started to twist to Helming, to cry out in
protest...when the glint of blonde hair caught my eye. Good God!
Was she here? The girl that had fled to me for help. I peered into
the horror pit...</p>

<p>I could not find her. But just there, where I had thought she
was, I saw a doorway, and I thought the portal moved.</p>

<p>"Doc," Jim Rand was saying behind me. "I don't see Hen Garten.
He should be here."</p>

<p>Helming clucked. "That's right. He's not at his post. I told him
the next time he wandered off I'd fire him, get another guard."</p>

<p>Rand sounded uneasy. "I dunno, Doc Maybe Shang..."</p>

<p>The door was moving out there. It was opening, and from it there
came a gibbering wail, the long-drawn howl of a soul lost in
torment. The lunatics below surged away from it. I heard Rand gasp,
saw him plunge past me, down the last few steps. His face was
white, his whip upraised. The door at the other end of the chamber
flung wide, and framed in it was a form more horrible than any I
had yet seen.</p>

<p>The thing's torso was that of a giant, tremendous; but atop the
spreading shoulders a tiny, doll's head lolled. A doll's
head&mdash;but no doll's head ever showed the sheer: brutality, the
utter savagery of that face. Its scalp was hairless, but its great,
naked chest was shaggy as any beast's. Its arms, incredibly long,
were lifted high. Broken chain-links hung from their wrists, and in
their great gripping hands something was suspended...</p>

<p>"Shang!" Rand roared. "Shang!" He plunged toward it, his whip
slashing a way through the cowering, shrieking lunatics. "Drop him,
Shang!"</p>

<p>The thing howled once more; there was obscene triumph in the
sound, and it threw that which it held straight at the oncoming
keeper. The door slammed shut...</p>

<p>What lay squashed on the floor had once been a man. A black whip
was knotted around its skewed neck, its face was a gory pulp.</p>

<p>A girl crawled to it along the floor. She prodded the shapeless
corpse with a long-nailed finger, and laughed.</p>

<p>Rand reached the body. He seized the girl and flung her away,
knelt to what lay there. He only glanced at it, and turned a white
face to us on the stairs. His eyes were black coals, and his mouth
worked. "It's Hen, Doc. Hen! He must have gone in to feed Shang and
the brute got him."</p>

<p>Helming giggled inanely. "I told him not to, the fool. I told
him to leave Shang alone. You'd better go in and chain the fellow
again."</p>

<p>Rand's lips were a thin white slash across his swart face. "Not
me. Not on your tintype. I don't go in there."</p>

<p>"Some one has to. The Holmes girl is in there. If he gets at
her..."</p>

<p>"I'm not going in there, that's flat. He can have the
yellow-haired she-devil for all I care."</p>

<p>The yellow-haired...Good Lord! I twisted to Helming. "Who's in
there? Who is it? Not the..."</p>

<p>"The girl Jim chased into your room. Yes. She's in a punishment
cell, in there. If Shang gets at her..." His eyes were glowing
strangely, a corner of his little mouth lifted. But I did not
notice it then. All I thought of was that <i>she</i> was somewhere
back there, at the mercy of the monster I had just seen, the
monster who had done...that!</p>

<p>"Good Lord," I groaned. "You're not going to let him get her.
You wouldn't do that!"</p>

<p>Helming spread his hands wide. "I wouldn't dare go in there. And
Rand is afraid. What can I do about it?"</p>

<p>"What..." I twisted from him, plunged down into the gibbering
mass of maniacs that had clotted at the foot of the stairs, as far
from the door as they could get. I shoved through them, saw
leering, idiot faces on every side, some still working with the
contagion of fear, others already betraying the forgetfulness that
is insanity's one recompense. A thin hand clutched my sleeve,
dreamy eyes peered into mine, and a soft mouth said: "Wait, pretty
boy. Wait for my kisses." I tore myself away and was through
them.</p>

<p>Rand made no motion to stop me, but skewed around on his knees
and watched me from between the slitted lids. The fetor here was
choking, revolting. I was at the further door, reached for its
knob. From behind it I could hear a muffled sobbing. My fingers
shook as I turned the knob and pushed the heavy, nail-studded door
open.</p>

<p>Even out of the vague half-light of the bedlam from which I came
my eyes could not penetrate the darkness ahead. I took a step
forward. The door shut behind me&mdash;and I heard the rattle of a
shot bolt. An oath ripped from me as I whirled and surged against
the door. It was immovable. Rand had locked me in here, locked me
in the darkness with the gigantic madman, the simian figure that
had made pulp of a human! I was unarmed...Hen had had the black
snake-whip and the thing they called Shang had knotted that dread
weapon around his twisted neck. Panic seized me as I crouched and
listened to dreadful sound that came from within, the blubbering
sobbing as of a gorilla baby crying. Panic rocked me as I heard the
tinkle of metal and the whisper of shuffling movement that came
toward me.</p>

<p>I crouched, my biceps flexing, my fingers spread wide, curving,
as the menace came toward me through the darkness. The blub, blub
of the thing was more fearful than an animal growl would have
been.</p>

<p>I crouched lower, and moved silently sidewise with some dim idea
of evading the monster, of avoiding it in the blackness. But
solidity stopped me, the solidity of a stone wall that barred my
progress. I was caught, fairly caught, and Shang crept slowly to
the attack!</p>

<p>Slowly! God how slowly that mad giant was coming! The blackness
was graying a bit as my pupils widened. I could make out the
shapeless bulk of him, dark against the dark. He seemed to be
crouched as I was crouched, seemed to be hitching himself along
spasmodically, jerking forward with each blubbing sob, jerking
forward and gasping at the same instant, silent and motionless at
the same instant. He was feet from me...</p>

<p>And then he was gone! There was nothing before me but the
black-gray of emptiness. I heard nothing, nothing at all. He had
vanished like...like something half-seen in the instant between
sleep and waking, unseen when midnight terror has one fully
awake!</p>

<p>Was this too, unreal? Like the black in Dunn's office, like the
room where I had seen a man murdered, a room that never was? I bit
back a scream that ripped at my dry throat, swallowed hard. There
<i>had</i> been something there! Shang <i>had</i> been there, he
had found a side exit from the corridor we were in, had slipped
aside to avoid me. He had been afraid of me, had fled from me. It
was so dark here that I could not see the side-opening through
which he had gone. That was all. That must be all!</p>

<p>If that were so I could find the exit he had used by moving
forward, by feeling along the walls. I tried and found that my arms
could span the width of the corridor, that my fingertips could
scrape each side. I started forward, hesitated...What if he were
still lurking on one side or the other? What if he should leap out
at me from some ambush where he was hidden? Was he playing with me,
luring me away from the door that might admit Rand or Helming to my
aid? I swayed in indecision, groaned...</p>

<p>And heard an answering moan, far ahead! The moan of a woman in
anguish. A pitiful little sound, muffled and tiny in the vague
reaches that seemed endless before me. I forgot myself, forgot
Shang. "Where are you?" I called, remembering to pitch my tone low.
"Where are you?"</p>

<p>My question rolled into the tunnel, reverberant. It seemed to me
I could follow its progress as it wandered off into the dim
passage. And after awhile&mdash;it must have been at once but to my
taut senses minutes seemed to elapse&mdash;a feminine voice come
back in reply. "Here. Here! Save me. Oh save me!"</p>

<p>The words, the words and the very voice that I had heard before,
in my room! I leaped ahead, running, reckless of Shang, reckless of
everything except that the golden-haired girl was ahead somewhere,
that she was in trouble, needed me.</p>

<p>The passage seemed interminable, my flying feet seemed to be
spurning a treadmill that ripped fast and faster beneath them while
I advanced not at all. But at last the corridor twisted, I saw
light ahead, dull light that seemed bright after the darkness. I
heard her voice again.</p>

<p>"Save me!"</p>

<p>The voice came from behind a door in the side of the passage,
the light from a transom over it. I dug heels to a stop, whirled to
the door. Bolts held it shut, two bolts that sank deep into
dull-gleaming sockets. I flicked them loose, jerked the door open.
And stopped, aghast. "The devils," I gritted. "The lousy
devils!"</p>

<p>It was a room like the one in which I had first come to, its
walls quilted with gray canvas. It was a cell, a padded cell. But
there was no cot there, no furnishing of any kind. There was only a
vertical framework of steel, white enameled, a vertical square
framework some six feet high. And within it...I balled my fists and
cursed those who had done this thing with every malediction in
English and Spanish and bastard Indian to which I could lay my
tongue.</p>

<p>She hung there in chains, chains that stretched her arms
horizontally from her shoulders, that held her little feet together
in the center of that fiendish square. She had fainted, her head
lolled forward on her bent neck, and her long hair, a ripple of
falling sunlight, all but veiled the flaccid but unutterably lovely
curves of her slender form. One garment&mdash;a flimsy, pastel
colored gossamer web&mdash;was all that they had left her and
through it I could glimpse the golden sheen of her skin. The golden
sheen of her skin, and something more! Livid red weals marked that
fragile flesh, red marks of a cruel whip like those that still
burned on my own cheeks.</p>

<p>I managed to get to her. The chains were not locked, merely
hooked together so that they could be easily loosed. I unfastened
the lower ones first, then the ones that held her wrists. She fell
into my arms. For a moment I held her, shaken by the warm feel of
her, for a moment I drank in the sheer young beauty of her face.
Then her long lashes trembled against the soft swell of her cheeks,
her lids opened, and I was looking into deep blue pools of fear, of
terror. "Oh," she gasped, and twisted from my hold. "Oh!" She slid
away from me, cowered against the wall. Her mouth quivered.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," I said gently. "I'm trying to help you." I
slid out of my suit-jacket, tossed it to her. "Here, slip into
that, it will make you more comfortable."</p>

<p>As she obeyed she searched my face. "You...why you're the man
who...whose room..."</p>

<p>"You ran into when you were trying to get away from Rand. Yes. I
tried to help you out then but I wasn't very successful. I'm Hal
Armour, at your service." I bowed.</p>

<p>A tiny, fugitive smile lightened her face an instant, and a
little of the terror seeped from her eyes. "And I'm Nan
Holmes."</p>

<p>Her voice was tight, husky, edged with hysteria. It brought me
back to our situation, the danger we were in, the threat of the
prowling maniac who for some reason had evaded me. Time enough to
ask questions later. "Look here," I said. "We've got to get out of
here somehow. I don't know anything about this place..."</p>

<p>"I do. There is a way out."</p>

<p>"Through the big room back there? I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"No. In the other direction. Another staircase."</p>

<p>"Come on then," I began. "If Shang..." I stopped as her eyes
flashed wide with renewed terror, stopped and whirled to the door
behind me.</p>

<p>The giant stood in the opening, his little head thrust forward,
foam dribbling from his protruding lips, his tiny eyes fixed not on
me but on Nan beyond me!</p>

<p>I leaped toward him, my fist arcing. But I never reached him.
One long arm flicked forward, a back-handed swipe sent me reeling.
I twisted, plunged back to the attack. And again the brute crashed
me effortlessly away. I skidded along the floor, the wall stopped
me. I was half-stunned, my senses were alert but my limbs refused
to obey the frantic signals of my brain. I watched Shang's
curiously bowed legs shamble slowly toward the girl, watched his
hairy fingers curve to seize her, watched the avid, lascivious
working of his thick-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>A squeezed, tiny voice whispered, "Hal! Save me, Hal!" It pulled
my gaze to Nan, to the terror that struck all beauty from her face,
to the hopeless appeal in her eyes.</p>

<p>And suddenly strength was back in my muscles! I rolled over,
lifted to toes and spread fingers in a sprinter's crouch, hurled
myself at Shang's twisted legs in a football tackle. My arms
clamped around his knees, my shoulder struck, and he crashed
down.</p>

<p>I had time only to yell, desperately, "Run, Nan, run!" and then
the volcano exploded. I was lost in a mad maelstrom of fighting, a
frenzy of threshing arms, legs, a whirlpool of bared teeth, ripping
nails. The noisome thing I fought was a growling, mad animal; a
fanged demon; a volcano of restless fury. But reason, civilization,
was stripped from me also. I fought him fang for fang, claw for
claw, in a snarling battle that knew no rules, no mercy.
Scratching, gouging, biting, I was primordial male battling for my
mate, he was ape-man raiding from the dank jungle. He was
gorilla-man, his strength triple mine, his maniac fury
unconquerable. But for minutes, for long minutes, I held him
even.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;his shaggy fingers were
clamped around my throat, he was atop me, his knees crushing my
chest. His drooling, horrible face was close to mine; his yellow,
rotted fangs bared by curled back, black lips; his tiny eyes
red-blazing with maniac fury. His fingers started to close, my
breath was cut off; his fingers were tightening, tightening; his
face blurred, was gone in a black mist that veiled my bulging eyes;
my lungs were bursting, my fists flailed at his arms that were
columns of whipcord and steel; beat weakly, fell flaccidly
down...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE VOICE IN THE
HALL</h2>

<p class="first">A SHRILL whistle pierced the mists. I felt the
fingers crushing my throat jerk. The whistle came again...above me
the monster whimpered. And suddenly the hands were gone from my
neck, the weight from my chest. I pulled air into my torn lungs; it
cut knife-like. A nausea retched me, I fought it as the haze
obscuring my vision faded. Pain pulsed in my throat, my chest, and
the floor heaved under me. But I was alive, miraculously I was
alive, and Shang was gone! I could see now, and he was nowhere in
the room. Nan was gone too. I was alone.</p>

<p>I lay helpless, gasping, gathering strength for the effort to
rise. A voice sounded at the door, Helming's giggle. The
physician's round face swam over mine, his cold fingers were on my
wrist. "You're all right, my boy," he chuckled. "All right."</p>

<p>"Shang," I husked, the words rasping my palate. "Shang."</p>

<p>"He got away. We don't know where he is. He's prowling somewhere
around."

<p>Uneasiness flickered in Helming's eyes.</p>

<p>"Why? Why? Why didn't he kill you?"

<p>He shrugged.

<p>"His spasm passed, I
suppose. It's happened before. But come, we've got to get you to
your room, take care of you. You're pretty well bunged up." He slid
an arm under me, lifted. With his aid I managed to get to my feet.
"How did he catch you, here?"</p>

<p>Something in his face warned me to be careful how I answered.
Something in his face, and my suit jacket, lying crumpled in the
corner. Its message was plain. "I was looking for him," I mumbled,
"and found this room. Heard a sound at the door and there he was. I
suppose those are the chains by which he was bound."</p>

<p>"Yes," Helming lied, and relief showed on his rotund
countenance, was quickly hidden. "Yes. We keep him here. But he's
so powerful when he gets one of his fits that nothing will hold
him. When he is running amuck he is dangerous, will kill anyone he
sees, on sight. And all we can do is keep out of his way till the
spasm passes. But he's never yet succeeded in getting out of this
part of the asylum. God help us if he ever does." He wasn't
giggling now, fear quivered in his tones. "But we've got to get you
to your room. It's late; a good night's sleep is what you
need."</p>

<p>I could walk unsupported by now. I followed him out into the dim
corridor on which this room fronted, shot a glance to the right as
my scalp prickled at the thought that Shang still lurked out there,
drooling venom. Helming's flabby hand turned me to the left. We
hurried through the dimness, ten paces or so, the corridor turned
again, and a staircase lifted ahead of me. "This way," he said. I
started to mount. But turned back suddenly to an agonized howl that
ripped out from somewhere below.</p>

<p>"Good God," I gasped, staring at another stairs that dipped down
to darkness alongside the one I was on. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," Helming giggled, pushing me gently upward. "We
have to use some pretty stern discipline here sometimes. One of our
inmates was somewhat unruly, and Jim Rand is teaching him a lesson.
Jim believes in the old adage, 'spare the rod and spoil
the&mdash;er...lunatic' It's nothing, though; the fellow is making a lot
more noise than what he is getting warrants."</p>

<p>I was too weak to argue, too weak to resist the compulsion with
which he urged me on, though gooseflesh prickled along my spine. I
recalled the sadistic lust in the big keeper's eyes. No, Rand was
scarcely one to spare the rod.</p>

<p>I could still hear those howls as we reached the head of the
stairs and a steel-barred gate like that at the other end of the
corridor with the numbered doors. Helming swung this open. "The
lock on this is broken," he smiled. "I shall have to get it fixed
in the morning. No hurry, though. Everyone here knows that these
stairs lead only to Shang's quarters, and I assure you no one would
try to escape that way." He giggled.</p>

<p>"Suppose he found he could get out through there," I asked.
"What then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. He's due to be quiet for at
least twenty-four hours now, and by that time the lock will be
fixed." He paused, then said meaningfully. "Of course, if he should
get another spasm he'll remember that he didn't finish you off and
come looking for you. But here's your room. Pleasant dreams, my
boy. Pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>Before I could voice my protest I was in my room and the door
had closed behind me. I reeled across the floor, found the cot in
the darkness, fell across it. For a long time I lay there,
unthinking, feeling only the pain of my wounds, feeling only black
despair.</p>

<p>But after awhile thought started again. And I had plenty to
think about. Nan, for instance. Was she safe? Had she gotten away?
Where was she? What was she doing in this place anyway? There had
been terror in her face, fright, but not insanity. By all that was
holy her eyes had been sane as mine.</p>

<p>As mine? I groaned. <i>Was</i> I sane? For an instant the panic
question reached its livid tendrils into my brain. Even now I was
not sure how much that I had seen was real, how much the product of
my own fevered imagination. The dreadful quarter-hour when I had
crouched in that dark tunnel, trapped, while Shang slithered closer
and closer, only to vanish inexplicably...</p>

<p>Inexplicably! So much there was unexplainable in what had
passed! Rand's terror, for instance, of the mad monster, and
Helming's. Apparently that had not lasted for long, since the
doctor had appeared in Shang's very bailiwick not long after and
displayed no trepidation. The bolting of the door behind me, why
had that been done? <i>To make sure I could not escape from the
beast?</i></p>

<p>And what was it that had saved me at the last? Not a change in
Shang's mood but the piercing whistle I had heard. Who had given
that whistle, Helming? Rand? If they could control Shang why had
they been afraid of him? <i>Were</i> they afraid of him? I caught
myself up as my speculations came around full circle. If I kept
thinking along that weary treadmill I should go mad. <i>Go</i> mad?
Was I not already...</p>

<p>Damn it! I must stop thinking. Sleep. I needed sleep, God knows
I needed it. My body was wracked with pain, my limbs water weak.
Maybe sleep would clear my mind, bring me strength.</p>

<p>Sleep...Sleep...</p>

<p>I dreamed of Nan Holmes, her golden hair a shimmering veil
through which I caught glimpses of her white body; her rounded
arms, pink-tipped hands stretched imploringly to me. Her blue eyes
drew mine to them, I looked deep into their cerulean depths; sank
deep, deep into their peace, their promise...</p>

<p>And snapped awake! Wide awake, and quivering in the darkness
with the sense of danger close at hand! I lay tensed, not stirring,
and fought cold fear clutching my throat as Shang's fingers had
clutched; fought cold fear and listened...to silence, to dead
silence of the silent house. There was no sound. But I knew, knew
beyond doubt, that some deadly peril threatened me. I felt its
aura, froze in its icy, creeping menace.</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a sound. No, not quite a sound, a sense of
movement, infinitely slow, infinitely cautious movement, somewhere
in the room. Against the tautness of my neck muscles I forced my
head around, till I could look in the direction from which it
seemed to come towards the door. A vague thread of yellow light,
vertical, thin as a hairline, bisected the darkness. Imperceptibly
it widened, was pencil-thick, was finger-wide. Someone, something,
was opening my door! A shout tore at my throat, a scream of
fear...but made no sound. Nightmare paralysis quenched it;
nightmare paralysis made of me a marble statue in the grip of
gibbering, grisly terror. Unbearable terror!</p>

<p>Something blobbed the dim light-line, inch-wide now, something
black, serrated. A hand clutching the door edge. A hand whose
fingers were hirsute, shaggy with black hair! The hand of an ape.
<i>The hand of Shang!!</i></p>

<p>No! It couldn't be, it must not be. This was a dream, a
nightmare of terror. That was why I felt this unutterable fear,
which I could not move. It wasn't so! It wasn't...God! What sort of
man was I to lie there, motionless, while grisly death crept into
the room? I surged from the bed&mdash;<i>tried</i> to surge.
Something threw me back, held me to the cot, held me helpless.
<i>Something!</i> Great Jupiter! It wasn't fear that held me rigid,
it wasn't terror! <i>I was strapped down!</i> By all that was
fiendish, I was strapped to that bed with the same webbed bands
that had been my first experience of this House of Hell!</p>

<p>A low growl twisted my look to the door again; a fetid, animal
smell affronted my nostrils. The opening was wider now, wide enough
to admit the mad giant's tiny head, wide enough, almost, for his
broad, furry, twisted frame. His eyes, peering in, glowed red with
the lurid light of madness, I could hear his deep breathing...</p>

<p><i>He was in!</i> The door swung to behind him, so that only the
faintest of light-lines showed that it had not latched. His dark
form bulked against it for an instant, vanished. He merged with the
darkness, only his eyes showed, his red-gleaming tiny eyes that
came steadily toward me, moving faster and faster as the pad of his
bare feet slithered toward me along the floor.</p>

<p>And now he loomed close above me, so that I could see his
towering form black against the black. And now his fingers touched
my cheek, his furry fingers, crept slowly down along my cheek,
rasping; drifted along my jaw, under my chin; found my
throat...</p>

<p>The door crashed open, light flooded in. The piercing whistle
sounded, the mysterious whistle I had heard before. Shang's fingers
left my throat, he whimpered, twisting to the door. My own eyes
went to it; I glimpsed a figure, a woman; voluptuous curves
outlined by light striking through sheer silk of a nightgown, ebony
hair-coif above somber eyes. The whistle sounded once more, Shang's
bulk blocked the vision from my staring eyes, he swept through the
door, it slammed behind him. I heard a contralto voice, berating,
its words indistinguishable; heard a squeal like that of a
chastised beast, heard the pad of Shang's feet moving away, and
heard no more. Heard no more...but lay staring into darkness, cold
sweat-damp dewing my forehead...</p>

<p>For a long time I knew only that I had been once more delivered
from certain death at the hands of the giant maniac. For a long
time my clogged, bewildered brain did not go beyond that bare fact.
I think, in those moments, that I was as near the empty, physical
shell as ever a man can be this side of the grave.</p>

<p>The Stygian gloom brooding about me was no blacker than that
within my soul. The silent house was no more silent than any
whisper of hope in my brain. I was in the meshes of a net of horror
from which there was no escape, in the hands of fiends from hell
itself. Or&mdash;I could not keep the dread speculation from my
pain-racked brain&mdash;or none of these incredible things were
real&mdash;all were the weird phantasmagoria of a mind wandering in
outer darkness.</p>

<p>Slow footsteps moved along the hall, slow shuffling footsteps,
something vaguely familiar about their sound. Good Lord, what was
going to happen now? They shuffled nearer. A low moan was distinct
in the hush, choked by a gasp of terror. And suddenly there were
other, running footsteps, a harsh voice bawling:

<p>"Hey you!" Jim Rand's voice, enraged. "Hey!"</p>

<p>The other groaned. I heard Rand reach him, heard a hard thud. I
knew, as if I had seen it, that the brutal keeper had slammed the
prowler against the corridor wall.

<p>"Damn it! Where are you going? How did you get out?"</p>

<p>"I...I...my door&mdash;wasn't latched. I wanted to..."

<p>Deep-chested tones that were yet edged with the thinness of old
age. My skin prickled, and I threw myself frenziedly against the
webs that held me. My God! Oh my God.</p>

<p>"Yuh wanted to get away. Damn yuh!"

<p><i>Crack!</i> Crack of Rand's whip on human flesh! His victim screamed.

<p>"No! No! Don't whip me. Kill me but don't use that whip on me!"

That voice again, <i>the voice I knew.</i>

<p>"Don't!"

<p>The canvas belt cut my skin as I fought against it, fought frenziedly, unavailingly.</p>

<p>"Jim! Jim! Stop it!" Helming's voice, sharp, commanding. "Quit
it!"</p>

<p>"But he..."</p>

<p>The physician was nearer. "Take him to his room. And find out
how he got out. Hurry." Excitement in his voice, and fear. "Good
Lord, if he got away and Dunn knew of it!"</p>

<p>The noises moved down the corridor. A door slammed somewhere.
There was silence again.</p>

<p>Silence, and molten ice running through my veins. No question
now of my sanity, no question at all! Horror curdled my blood, and
then I laughed, laughed silently and long into the rags that
stuffed my mouth. Funny, oh how funny it was! I thought, actually
thought, I had heard my father's voice. I had heard, real as Rand's
gruff, berating tones, the voice of my father who was dead for a
month! I laughed till the tears came. What a joke that was, what a
funny, funny joke. <i>I would tell it tomorrow to the fellow with
the big head who saw eyes all around him, red staring eyes.</i>
Maybe it would make him forget his eyes and he'd laugh with me!</p>

<p>Then suddenly I was sobbing, sobbing like a baby. I didn't want
to be crazy. I didn't want to hear voices and see things that
weren't there, I didn't want to be like those dead-eyed men in the
room below who mewed and gibbered, and drooled at the mouth...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE BECKONING HAND</h2>

<p class="first">I MUST have slept, at length, for I next remember
a chill light defining the bare room, and black bars criss-crossing
a gray square of sky high up on the wall. I could not feel my body
at all so numbed it was. I lay quietly for a while, and despite the
throb of pain within my skull, despite the crawling horror of all
that I had seen and heard, knew peace, the dull unthinking peace of
utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>After a time, though, I became aware of racking thirst.
Consciousness of it grew on me till I was suffering the tortures of
the damned. I visioned lakes, cool lakes of icy water; foaming
cascades leaping down bosky precipices...</p>

<p>"Good morning Mr. Armour. Good morning." I hadn't noticed my
door opening, but Helming was in the room, clucking. "I hope you
are...er...recovered from your last night's indisposition. You did
a lot of running around, remember? And you finally got into a
really dreadful fight with one of our other inmates. I had all I
could do to separate you. Then after I got you back here and
thought you were sound asleep you started screaming again and we
had to come in and strap you down. I am very much disappointed in
you. Very much."</p>

<p>So that was his game, eh! I was to be convinced that nothing had
happened, the way I thought it did. Or...the worms of fear twisted
again in my addled brain...perhaps it was so. Good Lord! I started
to say something...changed it to a husked demand for water.
"Water!"</p>

<p>"Of course. Of course." Glass touched my parched lips and a
cooling draught trickled along my tongue. "Gently. Gently. Mustn't
gulp it all at once. That would be bad, bad."</p>

<p>I felt a bit better. He withdrew the tumbler, looked at me with
smouldering eyes whose corners crinkled with false good humor.
"Now, Mr. Armour, do you think we're going to have any more trouble
with you? Any more trouble?"</p>

<p>"Trouble?" I said weakly. "I don't want to make any trouble for
you."</p>

<p>He giggled. "Good boy. Sensible. Very sensible. If you remember
that we shall get along." He chuckled. "Willingness is half the
cure, we find. Half the cure. And the other half is remembering
that you are not quite...normal, remembering that things are not
always what they seem to you. Will you keep that in mind, my boy?
Will you?"</p>

<p>Peculiarly, menace had filtered into his face. It had hardened,
as once before; had become, for all its pink roundness, a mask
behind which lurked utter evil. White lines appeared, running from
flat nostrils to mouth corners, and his voice was suddenly flinty.
"Armour!" he rasped. "Nothing you thought you saw last night was
really so. <i>Nothing at all!</i>" He rapped out the last, and I
understood.</p>

<p>Monstrous things crawled in the depths of his tiny eyes&mdash;I
thought of Rand's black whip, of Nan Holmes chained almost nude in
the steel frame, of the wretch whose howls I had heard from the
nethermost depths of this hell-hole. My skin crawled. "Nothing
happened last night of any importance," I muttered. "I had some bad
dreams, that is all."</p>

<p>"That is all." The menace lifted from his countenance, but it
left dread in my own heart. "And you wouldn't be foolish enough to
tell anyone of those dreams? You have sense enough for that?"</p>

<p>"I have sense enough for that," I parroted. "God help me!"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" His infernal chuckle sounded again. "I have great
hopes of curing you yet." His pudgy hands washed one another
briskly. "And I have a surprise for you. A pleasant surprise."</p>

<p>What did this portend? What new outrage was germinating in his
black mind? I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Yes, a pleasant surprise. A visitor," he simpered. "An old
friend of yours has telephoned that he will be here to see you
shortly."</p>

<p>"Who?" I managed to say. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"You will see. You will see. But first we must remove those
uncomfortable straps from you, get you in shape to receive your
guest. We want you to look nice." He moved to the door. "Jim," he
called. "Jim."</p>

<p>Together they took off those accursed bands, and I bit my lips
to restrain a scream at the needle-stabbing pain of returning
circulation. They massaged me, worked over me, getting a semblance
of life back into my tortured frame. Cool water was grateful as Jim
sponge-bathed me, and fresh, clean underclothing was an untold
luxury. They gave back my suit too, cleaned and neatly pressed, and
I began to feel like something human once again. They even brought
food to me, toast, and crisp poached eggs, and steaming coffee in a
paper cup.</p>

<p>When I had finished the roly-poly doctor collected the paper plates
from which I had eaten and waddled to the door. There he turned to me.

<p>"Remember," he said softly. "Remember that I shall be able to hear
every word that is said in here. The room is wired for sound."

<p>He giggled again and closed the door behind him. But almost at once
there was a knock and the door opened again.</p>

<p>An age-stooped, wrinkled man with the flaring white side-burns
of a bygone age tottered in, tears glittering in his rheumy eyes.
His arms, held out to me at full length, were shaking visibly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Humperdinck!" I jumped forward to the ancient attorney who
had watched over the Armour fortunes for a quarter-century. "Uncle
Carl!" I wrung his long-fingered, bony hand. "God, I'm glad to see
you!" Glad wasn't the word for it. I quivered inwardly. Was this
release at last? Had he come to take me from this house of
hell?</p>

<p>He looked at me, his shrunken lips mumbling over false teeth.
Emotion was rendering him speechless, his dew-laps shook as he
tried to get words out. Behind him Rand closed my room-door softly
and I heard the latch click. "Uncle Carl," I said again, and the
familiar appellation reminded me of happier days in the rambling
old mansion on Fifth Avenue. "How did you find me?"</p>

<p>"The papers," he squeaked. "The newspapers." He fumbled in a
pocket of the caped coat he wore, pulled out a
<i>Herald-Tribune.</i> I saw the black headlines:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">ARMOUR HEIR GOES INSANE<br>
ATTACKS EXECUTOR IN WALL STREET OFFICE</p>
<br>

<p>My ink-smudged face stared at me from the page, and my father's!
Avery Dunn's too. My hackles rose at the sight of his slant eyes
and thin, cruel mouth.</p>

<p>"Thank God! You've come to get me out of here. I should have
known you would take care of me. You always have, haven't you,
Uncle Carl?"</p>

<p>His lips quivered, and my heart sank at the look in his eyes.
"Get you out?" There was pity in them, pity and <i>fear.</i> I
rocked back with the appalling realization that he was afraid of
me...that he, also deemed me insane. "Why? Aren't they treating you
well?"</p>

<p>I thought of Helming's parting warning...he was listening,
somewhere, to every word that passed between us. "Of course they
are." My tones went flat, dead. "Yes, of course. But&mdash;" I dared
that much&mdash;"But I'm not crazy, Uncle Carl. I'm not!"</p>

<p>"No," he piped, edging toward the door. "Of course you're not
crazy. I'll write a letter to the papers and have them correct that
statement. You're sick." He was speaking in the cajoling, soothing
manner one uses to babies and...<i>lunatics.</i> "You stay here for
a while and you will be all right? Dr. Helming impresses me as a
very fine man, a man who knows his profession. It is best for you
to stay here. Your old friend advises that, Harold. Your old friend
and your father's."</p>

<p>My mouth twisted bitterly. There was no help here, I could see
that. But there were things I wanted to know. "All right," I said,
meekly as I could. "All right if you say so. You know best, Uncle
Carl. But sit down and talk to me. I don't know anything of how dad
died. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>Relief showed on his face. He sank into the chair, I threw
myself across the bed. "Tell me about it, Uncle Carl," I repeated,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"It...it was very sudden," he began, rubbing his thin shanks
with his almost transparent hands. "I saw John the night before it
happened and he was quite well. More cheerful than he had been for
years. I was hopeful that the new companionship he had was bringing
him out of the hermit life he had imposed on himself since your
mother's death."</p>

<p>"Companionship!" I exclaimed, sitting up. "What...who...?"</p>

<p>Humperdinck blinked at me in owl-like surprise. "Didn't he write
you?"</p>

<p>"Mails are slow to Chile," I responded. "And uncertain. To what
are you referring?"</p>

<p>"To Mrs. Kahn of course."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kahn!" This was getting interesting. "Irma Kahn?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Then you do know about her."</p>

<p>I was evasive. "A little. Who is she, Uncle Carl?"</p>

<p>"She <i>claimed</i> to be your father's sister, your aunt. You
remember..."</p>

<p>"Yes." The old story woke in my mind. "Yes. He had a younger
sister who married a foreigner of some sort..."</p>

<p>"A Eurasian."</p>

<p>"...and went away, was lost sight of. It all happened before I
was born."</p>

<p>"That is it. This woman appeared shortly after you left for
Iquique and claimed to be she. I was doubtful, started an
investigation. But your father insisted on acknowledging her. He
took her into the house, and I must say it seemed to do him a great
deal of good. But as I was saying, I saw your father the day before
his death, we spoke of you&mdash;he was very proud of what you were
doing with the <i>estancia.</i> He was keen minded, I remember
remarking on his marvelous grasp of affairs when we started to draw
up his new will."</p>

<p>"To draw up a will. What..."</p>

<p>The old man raised a deprecating hand. "It left everything to
you. Everything he possessed, and made Mrs. Kahn his executrix. I
advised against that last, but he was obdurate."</p>

<p>I sank back. If I were his sole heir...</p>

<p>"Had it been otherwise I should have been suspicious of
something untoward, but the surrogate's court would watch the
estate carefully...and there was no reason to dispute probate."</p>

<p>I said nothing, but I was tense with attention. Somewhere here,
was the crux of my troubles...the explanation of what I was
undergoing. Where was it?</p>

<p>"John&mdash;your father&mdash;told me that he had put his yacht
in commission, was leaving the next day for a short sea trip.
'Irma,' he said, 'advises it, and I think she is right.' He did
leave on that trip...and never came back."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! He..."</p>

<p>"He was lost overboard. No one saw him go. He was in the
salon&mdash;so the report went&mdash;playing bridge with the
captain, Mrs. Kahn and Mr. Dunn..."</p>

<p>"Dunn was on board!" I broke in. "How..."</p>

<p>"He was a friend of Mrs. Kahn's, had made all the arrangements
for the cruise, hired the crew, and everything. As I was saying,
your father had been playing bridge, went out on the deck for a
breath of air while he was dummy, and, although the yacht was
searched from stem to stern, that was the last that was ever seen
of him."</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet. "Great Heavens above!" I shouted. "He was
murdered! They killed him!" My fists clenched. "They killed him,
you old fool, and you let them get away with it."</p>

<p>The lawyer looked frightened, rose, trembling, his old eyes
seeking the exit. "Calm yourself, Harold," he quavered. "Calm
yourself. Why should anyone kill him? The only one who could gain
by his death would be yourself. Surely you didn't sneak on board
and murder him."</p>

<p>He said it almost as if he expected me to say that I had done
just that. "You were in Chile at the time you know. In Chile."</p>

<p>I controlled myself by a great effort. No use scaring the old
man to death. I had gotten all I could out of him. I turned away
from him, walked over to the shelf-dresser, and twiddled with the
papier-mâché comb that lay there. "I'm sorry," I said slowly.
"Forgive me, Uncle Carl. I was excited." Two comb-teeth came away
in my fingers. "Of course he wasn't killed. He must have had one of
his usual attacks of vertigo, must have fallen overboard. Thanks
for coming," I said dully. "I...I appreciate it."</p>

<p>"I had to come. I dandled you on my knee, Harold, when you were
knee-high to a grasshopper." He bit his lip; he was at the door,
rapping on it.</p>

<p>Dr. Helming pulled the door open. "All through?" he chuckled,
rubbing his palms together. "Had a nice visit, I hope. A nice
visit."</p>

<p>Humperdinck turned in the doorway, the voluminous fold of his
cape filling it. "Goodbye, my boy&mdash;Goodbye."</p>

<p>I took his extended hand in my right but my left was busy too.
"Goodbye, Uncle Carl. Take care of yourself." Then he was gone, and
I was alone again with thoughts that were a scarlet thread through
the darkness of my bewildered brain.</p>

<p>I seated myself on the room's one chair, my elbows on my knees,
my face buried in my hands. And gradually, as my thoughts wandered
in those long corridors of black despair something obtruded on my
senses. An almost imperceptible aroma of&mdash;ethereal sweetness
called to me, warmed minutely the sluggish cold stream in my veins.
A tendril of scent still clung to the sleeves of my jacket, of a
clean, fresh scent. It was the ghost of the white form my jacket
had clothed for moments only, the aura of the golden girl whose
blue eyes had twice looked to me for help, for help that I could
not give her. Suddenly my breath came faster, my heart pounded
hotly, my lips set in a grim, hard line. And I knew there was work
for me.</p>

<p>The corridor outside was hushed, silent. Nothing moved out
there. From somewhere came a faint murmur of sound, sound
repulsive, bestial. That must be from the common-room below where
bedlam reigned. I remembered how that room was peopled and caught
my breath while an icy shudder took every cell in my body. If they
had her there, down there in that place of evil! My teeth gritted.
Even if she were in that Avernian pit I would find her, tear her
from its unimaginable horror. Even from there! But somehow,
calmness came back to me, somehow I felt that it was not there I
should find her.</p>

<p>Helming had told me there was a Dictaphone hidden in this room,
a metal ear that eavesdropped on every sound within its range.
Perhaps someone still listened at its other end. Well, I had passed
through much, had had little rest. I rose, stretched and yawned.
"God, but I'm sleepy," I murmured aloud. I tossed myself on the
cot, its spring creaking. I waited a while, let my breathing grow
slower, let a soft snore sound. I snored again, more loudly. Then I
was breathing deeply, letting the sound of that breathing die away.
I was utterly silent, straining my ears for any intimation that
someone stirred in the hall.</p>

<p>The quiet out there was absolute. And the silence within my room
was unbroken as I slid slowly, reining my muscles with infinite
precaution, from the cot. I lowered myself to the floor, squatting
there as my fingers unfastened my shoes and slid them off. Now I
was stealthily crawling, moving inch by inch with taut care, so
that there was not even the whisper of scraping fabric
to&mdash;warn any listener I had left the bed. It seemed to me that
hours passed before I crossed those few feet to the door.</p>

<p>And now I had reached it, and my hand was lifting, silently,
slowly, to purchase on the edge that fit so tightly against the
jamb. Blood pounded in my ears, a muscle twitched in my cheek. My
palm lay flat against wood&mdash;I hesitated&mdash;pushed. And the
panel moved, moved slightly outward under that gentle shove.</p>

<p>My heart leaped. The two paper teeth that I had concealed
between my fingers, that I had pushed into the lock-slot in that
door jamb with my left hand as I shook Humperdinck's with my right
while his cape concealed my act from Helming; those two paper teeth
had jammed the latch so that it had not caught. The asylum-keeper's
wily schemes, his paper comb that could not be used as a weapon,
his knobless door that needed no lock, had boomeranged against
him.</p>

<p>I coughed back a sudden laugh of triumph. The door swung open. I
lifted to my stockinged feet and was in the corridor. It was dim,
deserted. The steel gates at either end were closed, their bars
glimmering in an eerie light. Was Nan up here, behind one of these
long rows of dark doors on which numbers were painted? Dared I open
them? What if some mindless occupant were to be startled by my
appearance, were to scream and bring Helming up here, Rand with his
whip? I swayed in indecision, nerving myself to the endeavor.</p>

<p>What was that? I twisted to a sound, midway of the hall, the
sound of an opening door. There it was, the panel moving slowly
outward. I gasped, started back toward my door. If I could get back
there before...But a slim white arm was reaching out of that
opening portal, a white, long-fingered hand was moving, was
beckoning to me. A whisper, light, feminine, reached me. "In here!
Quick! In here, Harold!"</p>

<p>My dash to that door was a flicker of soundless movement. I was
in the room, the door shut behind me. And I was staring at...not
Nan...a woman tall and stately; a woman about whose rounded, mature
form a lacy black negligee clung, half concealing, half revealing;
a woman whose olive features were touched with a wistful, appealing
sadness; whose lustrous gray eyes, fixed on my face, were flecked
with gold.</p>

<p>My lips moved, but made no sound. This dark beauty, this woman
whose helmet of ebony hair quivered somehow with vibrant life,
whose nostrils flared just enough to show the shell pink of their
lining, whose curving lips were dreamy with sensuous promise, what
was <i>she</i> doing here in this madhouse? She was no inmate; her
poised, insouciant bearing told me that; the fact that her door was
not locked, the unbarred window, the luxurious furnishings of her
room. I took all this in at a glance, then her voice pulled my gaze
back to her, her voice that was the deep throb of a 'cello,
resonant, enthralling.</p>

<p>"Harold," she said, "Harold Armour!" and held out both arms to
me. The black gossamer web fell back from them, revealed soft
curves, glowing skin. "Harold!"</p>

<p>"You know me," I managed to say. "You..."</p>

<p>"But of course. I have a picture of you, Harold, a picture of a
chubby, naked infant with a most endearing smile. That was long
ago." She sighed, and a world of regret was in that suspiration.
"You have changed since that picture was taken, but I still can
trace that baby's lineaments in your man's face."</p>

<p>"You have a picture of me," I gulped. "Who..."</p>

<p>"Who am I?" A faint smile touched, just touched, the wings of
her luscious mouth. "Your dear father's sister, Harold, your aunt
whom you never knew. It was that picture that brought me back from
France. I could not bear to think of that baby alone in the world
with his sorrow, and I, his only kin, so far away. I rushed back,
and when I arrived, last night, my friend Avery Dunn told me
that...that..."</p>

<p>"That I was a lunatic who had tried to kill him. That I was in
an asylum."</p>

<p>"Yes," she breathed, and a tear trembled in the corner of her
eye. "I couldn't believe it. I rushed right out here. It was late
and Dr. Helming would not permit you to be disturbed. But he was
good enough to offer me this room for the night, and...and I have
only just awakened. I heard a movement in the hall, looked out and
recognized you, called you in so that I could talk to you alone.
Tell me, Harold, tell me that the horrible thing isn't so."</p>

<p>She moved closer to me, her aura seemed to enfold me with an
almost overpowering allure. I was drawn to her, drawn by something
that was <i>not</i> filial, not the affection of a nephew. My arms
crept up to take her within their embrace and suddenly I stiffened.
This was Irma Kahn, I remembered, the Irma Kahn who..."I am in an
asylum," I said with rigid lips. "Duly committed."</p>

<p>"Oh!" She seemed to feel the change in me. "But they may be
mistaken. You were hysterical with grief, unbalanced at the moment.
But today..." She made a little gesture with her hand, a pitiful
little gesture.</p>

<p>Somehow I felt there was something wrong about her something
deadly wrong. The smouldering flame in her eye, the sensuous slow
motion of her gorgeous body, the way each little movement displayed
new charms, were not compatible with her role of the aunt appealing
to her long-lost nephew for affection. They were rather the
practiced art of the courtesan, the devious artifice of a woman
fighting to awaken in the wanted male&mdash;passion! And yet, when
that gesture ended with the touch of her fingers on my arm I felt
an electric tingle at the point of contact, a tingle that thrilled
to my brain and exploded there.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, Harold. Let me help you."</p>

<p>I fought the fever in my veins, fought the unholy sweep of
desire that boiled within me. "May I ask," I ventured with tight
lips, "whether it was the picture of which you spoke that brought
you to my father...to see him die?"</p>

<p>"Harold!" She veiled quickly, but not quickly enough to hide
from me, the sudden stab of startlement, of hate, of malevolence
that flared in her eyes. "How could you say a thing like that?" I
felt suddenly like a wearied swimmer who feels firm ground under
his feet at last. "I came to my brother because I was at last free
to come after long years of separation. His tragic end," her voice
broke, "almost killed me too." I had said so little, so very
little, to induce this outburst!</p>

<p>But she recovered quickly. She came closer, so that she was
pressed against me, her warm breath was sweet in my nostrils, her
great, lustrous eyes were demanding, urgent. Her hands slid up
along my arms, were around my neck. "Harold," she throbbed, "dear
boy. Don't thrust me away. I have starved for love, for the love of
my own, so long, so long."</p>

<p>I was certain now she was not, could not be my aunt. And that
certainty was all the worse for me. For the kisses trembling on her
lips were there for me to take, the hot pulse of her blood found an
answer in the pound of my own heart. A maelstrom of desire whirled
in my reeling brain, a great voice shouted in my ears. "Take it.
Take what she is offering. What difference who she is, what she is?
She is woman, incarnate woman, and the delights that are yours for
the asking are such as you never yet have tasted."</p>

<p>In another moment...Thin sound came to me from beyond the door.
A scream! A woman's scream! <i>Nan's scream!</i> It came again. I
threw Irma from me, saw her reeling, saw the agonized frenzy in her
eyes, and whirled, plunged out.</p>

<p>The faraway scream came again, from my right&mdash;from the
staircase up which Helming had led me last night&mdash;the
staircase that dropped down to darkness, to the mazed labyrinth
where Shang prowled. Great God! I lunged toward the gate, got my
hands on it, pulled. It swung open; the lock had not been repaired!
I pounded down toward where Nan's cries came again and again, but
fainter, further away.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; BOTTOM OF HELL</h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS a well of darkness down which I hurled
myself, a well of darkness veiling the Lord alone knew what dread
secrets. But far below I could hear the faint shrieks of the golden
girl; her shrieks, and a snuffling, growling rebuttal that told me
the mad giant had her. Shang had her, and was taking
her...where?</p>

<p>I reached the first landing, where was the passage into the
corridor where first I had met the madman. I stopped, listened. The
cries I had heard did not come from below, from the further descent
whence had come other howls, howls of anguish at which the
round-faced owner of this madhouse had giggled. I whipped on, down
into that mystery.</p>

<p>Nan's anguished screams were close ahead. Close! Was I in time
to save her? The stone steps down which I hurtled twisted. I
pounded around the last projecting corner of sweating gray
granite...and crashed against something that threw me back with
tremendous force, the force of my mad plunge! I sprawled, stunned
for an instant, lifted to my feet, and saw that a steel-barred gate
closed an arched doorway. Beyond there was a vaulted, dark chamber
walled with slimy stone. The girl's shrieks, distant again, burbled
into sudden, appalling silence.</p>

<p>I hurled myself at those bars. They were locked. I battered at
them, yelling incoherently; tossed my quivering body at them. My
jacket ripped from my shoulders. My arms, my forehead, dripped
blood, a gush of warm liquid spurted across my cheek, but the
barrier at which I battered was immovable. I clung to the bars at
last, stared through them with eyes that must in that moment have
been truly insane.</p>

<p>Dimness fronted me, dungeon dimness and blacker shadows lying
across green-scummed pools that made the broken-boarded floor of
the dungeon a noisome plain. Loathsome things scuttered in veiling
gloom. A sudden howl of agony twisted my head to the right as my
heart came into my throat. Light flooded across another arched
doorway there, light somehow lurid, and beyond it...Oh
God!...bathed in that bloody glare a naked form hung, its bare
toe-tips just scraping the floor! The writhing form of a man hung
like that from chains clamped to his wrists; his back was toward
me, and across that quivering back crimson weals dripped
slow-oozing, ruby droplets that ran in gory rivulets to mingle with
the sweat of agony glistening on his tortured frame!</p>

<p><i>Crack!</i> Black, snake-like, a whip lashed from the
door-side and sliced across that agonized back. It wrung another
howl from the man, convulsed his suspended form with a spasm of
pain that jerked his taut legs from the floor. The steel cuffs to
which the chains were fastened cut into his stretched wrists, and
from these too rivulets of blood streamed down his muscle-bulging
arms.</p>

<p>A shuffling sound jerked my eyes to the left, a shuffling sound
and the smack of bestial lips. A misshapen thing loomed in the
blackness. It came nearer, nearer? I saw it distinctly. And rocked
to supreme horror!</p>

<p>It was Shang! His diminutive head was out thrust from the awful
spread of his tremendous shoulders, little lights were crawling in
his beady eyes, spittle drooled from the corners of his
thick-lipped, lascivious mouth. His hairy, simian chest heaved with
crazed emotion, his bowed legs shambled through slime, and one
swarthy arm hung loosely at his side, so long that its knuckles
were inches from the scummy floor. The other...frantic protest
shrieked soundlessly in my squeezed throat...the other arm was
curled around the waist of a limp form, the form of a girl, the
form of Nan!</p>

<p>She hung flaccid, her long golden hair trailing the mire, her
upturned eyes open but staring senselessly in some strange rigor of
uttermost terror. The clothes had been ripped from her torso...I
saw the corded muscles of her matchless neck, the soft round of her
breasts that a vagrant gleam of ruddy light just tipped with
fire...</p>

<p>"Shang! Shang! Oh God, Shang!" I screamed to the monster in some
mad hope that by my voice alone I could stop him from the horror to
which he stalked. "Shang!" I thrust my rasped arms through the
bars. "Don't Shang, don't!" He prowled on, and not even the twitch
of a muscle showed that he had heard me. But I flared with sudden
hope. He was shambling closer, closer, perhaps...He was right
before me, my extended bands clawed for his arm. But did not reach,
just, did not reach! Oh God Almighty! Oh God!</p>

<p>The grotesque being stalked on, a red glow in his pig-like orbs,
obscene expectancy in his gargoyle face, shambled on in a solitude
where there was neither sight nor sound. He swerved away from me,
was swallowed up by blackness this side of the red-lighted archway,
by blackness veiling some dark cave, some lair to which he had
dragged his prey. But just before he vanished I saw a flicker of
light come into Nan's eyes, a flicker of dread awakening.</p>

<p>I rattled the bars, shook them as if I would tear them apart
with my bare hands, shrieked my soul's torture through them. And my
shrieks were answered by other screams, shrill screams of supernal
agony, of terror beyond comprehension, shrill screams from the
black cave where Shang had borne his victim.</p>

<p>"Harold! What is it, Harold?" I whirled to a voice behind me.
Irma Kahn! Her eyes glowing, her face alight with strange feeling.
"Why did you run from me, my dear?" Light from above struck through
the tracery of her lacy garment, showed her voluptuous curves, the
black coif of her hair. And I remembered! Remembered the woman who
had appeared in my doorway, the woman whose whistle had called
Shang from my throat. Thank God!</p>

<p>I leaped for her, clutched her arm. "Irma," I cried. "Irma.
Whistle for him. Whistle for Shang. He's got a girl there, Nan!
Call him off. Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>She pulled away from me, shrugged me off. And laughed in my
face! "Call him off," she gurgled. "Call him off from that girl you
prefer to me! Not I, dear boy. Not I! Why worry about her when you
can have me." Her eyes were suddenly slumberous. "When you can have
me?"</p>

<p>My hand fisted, raised above her. "Call him or I'll kill you." I
was frothing at the mouth. "I'll tear you limb from limb, I'll do
to you what he is doing to her."</p>

<p>"You'd strike me, Harold," her voice husked. "You'd strike me."
Her hands came up, a quick movement and the black lace fell from
her, she was a white flame in the dimness, a white flame of beauty.
Her head went back, her arms flung wide.</p>

<p>I rocked on my feet, the solid walls whirled about me. Oh God! O
good God! And suddenly I was laughing, shrieking with laughter,
with wild laughter that tore my throat, that ripped my lungs. We
were crazy! We were all crazy! She and Shang and Nan and I! We were
all stark raving mad!</p>

<p>Hinges squealed behind me, hinges squealed and the roar of an
enraged animal thundered in my ears. I whirled. Shang was leaping
through the open gate, his mad eyes glittering, his great arms
sweeping out. His mouth was open and the insensate beast's roar was
coming from it. I crouched, fear driving away madness, crouched to
meet his attack. He plunged past me&mdash;Great Jupiter&mdash;he
plunged past me and dived for the woman behind me, for Irma Kahn. I
heard her scream, glancing around I saw her turn and run, a white,
stark-naked figure, up the stone stairs. And after her plunged the
hairy brute, the maddened giant, doubly crazed now by jealousy!</p>

<p>They disappeared around the stair-curve. But I whipped through
the steel gate, open at last, whipped through&mdash;to meet Jim
Rand plunging from the red lit archway beyond. "Hey," he roared,
and his whip swept up&mdash;his whip swept up dripping blood,
sliced down at me. But I wasn't there. Taking a leaf from his own
book I had dodged. He staggered with the force of the missed blow,
my hand darted forward lightning-like, and ripped the whip from his
grasp. He launched a fist-blow at me. I parried it with the whip
and slashed at his face.</p>

<p>The reddened lash cut a weal across his cheek. He squealed,
lunged at me. But I had gone completely berserk. The memory of the
brutal whipping he had administered to me lent me strength, the
memory of all he had done. My arm rose and fell, rose and fell, and
the whip lash whistled through the air, crashed about his face, his
shoulders. I remembered the howling victim on whom I had seen him
use this very scourge, and slashed at him again. He crouched,
sprang. His hard fists landed somewhere on me...I heard their
thud...but still I beat at him with the thong that was his own
weapon, beat at him through red mists of wrath, through a seething
haze in which I could see only his face, dripping blood, and the
black thread of my whip snaking across it.</p>

<p>Sheer exhaustion stopped my arm at last. I looked down at the
quivering, senseless hulk lying in the slime at my feet, the
faceless horror that had been Jim Rand. A modicum of sanity came
back to me, and I shuddered. Good God! Had I done this? I? Then my
mouth twisted bitterly. It was a dreadful fate that had overtaken
him. But it was richly deserved. Richly deserved!</p>

<p>I twisted to his latest victim. A glance showed me that his
sufferings were over. That which hung in those chains would feel
pain no longer. He had escaped in the only certain way, from the
hell of insanity, from the devil that was Jim Rand. I envied
him.</p>

<p>But there was something I still had to do. What was it?
Something about a girl, a girl with golden hair. Of course. Nan.
Nan Holmes. She was somewhere in here. But where?</p>

<p>A low moan answered me, a low moan from the darkness where I
could see the arched mystery of a low doorway. I staggered to it,
and through.</p>

<p>The red light entered here not at all. But I could see
something, a very little, in the gloom...could see a pale bundle
that moved. I got to it, knelt to it. A wee small voice moaned a
word, a name. My name! "Hal. Save me, Hal."</p>

<p>And I was wholly sane again. "Nan," I groaned. "Nan," getting my
arms under her, lifting her. "Nan! Hal's here. I'm here, and I
won't let him touch you again."</p>

<p>Her arm slipped around my neck, she nestled in my embrace like a
little child as I struggled to my feet. "Safe, Hal Safe," she
murmured. She was so light, so light in my arms, and so sweet. I
turned to make my way out of that cave. Out of that cave to where?
Where in this house was safety for me...for Nan?</p>

<p>I turned, and halted. The red light out there was flickering
strangely, was brighter than it had been before. A foul, acrid odor
stung my nostrils... the pungent odor of smoke. Good Lord! As I
reached the exit from the cave, came out into the dungeon proper,
flames crackled. I twisted toward the ominous sound. And saw what I
could not have seen when I battered against the gate, what I had
overlooked in the furious melee of the fight with Rand.</p>

<p>A brazier had burned within the torture chamber, a caldron of
fire in which I saw them scattered now&mdash;irons heated for what
unholy purpose I could only guess&mdash;and guessing know renewed
satisfaction at the punishment I had meted out to Rand. But now
that brazier was overturned&mdash;probably while I battled with the
keeper&mdash;its coals were strewn over the wood floor of that
horror cell&mdash;and a sheet of fire was sweeping across the room.
Even as I looked a tall tongue of flame shot up, licked at the
hanging corpse!</p>

<p>The sight shattered a nebulous plan I had formed of hiding with
Nan somewhere in this labyrinth. I must get out, get her out, at
once. I leaped for the entrance where the steel gate still hung
open, leaped up the staircase. I must get out...</p>

<p>At the head of the first flight I turned into the dim passageway
where I had my first meeting with Shang. My skin crawled at the
recollection, but I pressed on. The tunnel echoed with my
incautious footsteps, and then suddenly another sound drowned their
reverberations. Sounds rather; shrieks, catcalls, an agonized
scream, pandemonium that was worse than anything I had yet heard!
Something was going on in the common-room where the mad inmates of
this asylum were gathered! I must know what it was before I dared
take Nan out there.</p>

<p>But if I left her here, and she came to before I returned? Came
to, and frightened, ran off somewhere where I could not find her. I
paused in indecision. And she stirred in my arms.</p>

<p>"Nan," I whispered. "Nan. Are you awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hal, I'm awake." She squirmed, got her feet down, clung to
me. I sensed little tremors running through her frame, tiny
shoulders that spoke vividly of her grueling experience.</p>

<p>A question burst from my lips, a question that had agonized me
since I had found her in that cave. "Nan. Did he? Did
Shang...?"</p>

<p>She shuddered. "No. Thank God. No. I screamed when I realized
where I was, fought him off for a second. And then he heard a voice
from outside, growled and rushed off. I fainted, I guess. But
somehow I knew you were near, were coming to save me. How...?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now." The faint, acrid odor of smoke warned me
that I must hurry. "Listen Nan, stay here a moment. I want to take
a look out there." Her hand snatched at my wrist. "Don't leave me
here, Hal. I'm afraid. Let me go with you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. There's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

<p>"Nothing to be afraid of!" She threw a fearful look over a
shoulder, a wide-eyed look into the shadows. "Shang!"</p>

<p>The very name sent a pang of fear through me. I thought of her
slight form in the monster's grip once more! "All right. Come
along, then. But stay behind me, and be ready to run if I give the
word."</p>

<p>It was thus that we crept through the rest of that dim passage,
I in front, she behind, while louder and louder came the turmoil
ahead, the shrieking tumult that was like a crazed horde of jungle
beasts battling in the steamy night, while stronger and stronger
came the fire-smell from behind. And thus at last we came to the
nail-studded door that opened to the hell-pit where Helming's mad
creatures were.</p>

<p>Hell-pit indeed! The door was slightly ajar, and the sounds that
came from behind it transcended all that hell could offer. I
singled out of the thunderous babble of sound a sepulchral voice
that howled, "The Old Guard dies but never surrenders. Up and at
them!" Someone else babbled, over and over, "Fly fly. It's the end
of the world." I recognized the wail of the big-headed little man,
"Eyes, eyes. They've got my eyes. O Holy Mother have mercy. Have
mercy!" And then, cutting knife-like through pandemonium, a woman
shrieked, her scream wire-edged with infinite terror! I pushed my
head around the door-edge...</p>

<p>Impossible to describe that scene! The big room was a seething,
boiling mass of fury, of grotesque figures milling in an
indescribable, frenzied storm; swirling about some center whose
nucleus I could not at the moment make out; and from there that
terrorized scream came again and again, vibrant with fear, with
horror. Another sound joined it, the ululation of a furious beast,
the booming battle-cry of a combat-frenzied gorilla.</p>

<p>Suddenly the maelstrom split. Something hurtled out of it, a
wizened, spidery creature bowling through the mad horde as if
catapulted by some gigantic machine. I saw Shang, his long arms
recoiling from the throw; his fangs exposed, ferocious; his hairy
chest a mass of clotted blood. And behind him I glimpsed the white,
nude form of Irma Kahn, blood-streaked, all beauty contorted from
her face as-her open mouth vented shriek after shriek of mortal
terror.</p>

<p>The inferno closed around them at once, what I had seen was but
the momentary flickering of a camera shutter, and the mad throng
surged forward. The bang of a shot jerked my eyes to the side, to
the staircase. Helming was crouching there, his face fish-belly
gray, a gun smoking in his hand as it jerked with another shot at
the frenzied mass that leaped, yelling and gibbering, about Shang
and his mistress. Helming wasn't giggling now, his little eyes
bulged out of the layers of fat, his tiny mouth quivered...</p>

<p>A conglomerate shriek greeted the asylum-keeper's second shot,
and suddenly the mad horde was streaming across the floor toward
him. He turned to run. His gun crashed. Arms, clawed hands reached
for him, caught him. He went down, screaming, under a piled mass of
horror.</p>

<p>All this had happened in seconds, in a time so short that my
head was still moving past the door-edge, a time too short for me
to have done anything had I so willed. Now my eyes swept back to
where I had seen Shang and Irma Kahn. They were still there...the
woman prostrate, the shaggy giant bending over her. I started
forward, stopped, irresolute.</p>

<p>"Oh, go get her, Hal," the girl's whisper sounded in my ear.
"You can't leave her there for...for those." She had read my
thought. "I'll be all right. Hurry!"</p>

<p>I darted out from my covert and Shang rose to meet me. Ice
chilled my blood. Were we to battle again, the gorilla-man and I?
He crouched, steadying himself on his bowed, twisted legs and the
knuckles of one long arm. His features were a leering gory mask
from which his malevolent little orbs stared out, his body was
mangled, torn, the great muscles exposed. As I neared I heard a
whimper, half of pain, half of defiance, issue from his contorted
lips. I tensed for his plunge.</p>

<p>But it never came! He jerked aside as I reached him, jerked
aside, whimpering. And I realized that his eyes were watching me
not at all, that they were directed past me, to the frenzied mass
that still boiled on the stairs. Wondering, I bent to Irma, lifted
her bleeding, unconscious body, turned back to the door. And
realization burst on me of what Shang feared!</p>

<p>For there was a sudden yell from the madmen on the stairs. The
mass there disintegrated, streamed toward me. I saw red-dripping
claws outstretched, red-smeared mouths in nightmare visages. I
tried to break into a run for the door behind which Nan waited but
panic rocked me as I knew that they must reach me before I could
make that shelter. Weak, exhausted, I staggered and nearly fell,
pulled myself erect and staggered on. Through a whirling, dizzy
mist I saw Nan's white face staring from the doorway, her imploring
arms out-flung. I heard her far-away scream: "Hurry, Hal,
Hurry!"</p>

<p>The burden on my shoulder weighed a ton; my legs moved through
some viscous, clinging fluid; the obscene imprecations, the animal
howls of the mad pack on my heels were louder, nearer. I could feel
their hot breath on my neck, their hands twitching at my sleeves.
I...couldn't...make it. "Close the door, Nan," I yelled. "Close the
door and get away."</p>

<p>She made no motion to obey, but her finger extended, pointing.
"Come on, Hal," she screamed. "Keep coming. Look!"</p>

<p>I twisted my head to where she was pointing, and saw the
distorted faces, the foaming mouths of the maniacs hunting me. Saw
them close, terribly close. But I also saw Shang's huge shaggy
figure lunging to meet them, saw his bared fangs slice the throat
of one screaming madman, saw his great hands reach out and snap the
necks of two others, saw him lift these last victims and use their
writhing bodies as clubs to slug back the oncoming horde.</p>

<p>I plunged on. Nan was right in front of me. I sprawled as I
reached her, sprawled through the door she held open and broke Irma
Kahn's fall as I sprawled. I twisted, through the closing door I
glimpsed Shang dragged down at last, heard his final howl, a howl,
strangely, of triumph, and the door slammed shut, blotting out the
sight. I heard the rattle of a bolt as Nan shot it home.</p>

<p>I rolled from under Irma, staggered to my feet. Nan went to her
knees at the woman's side, reached for her wrist. There was a
roaring in my ears, and my chest heaved, struggling for the breath
that had been robbed from me by the terrific exertions I had just
been through, exertions that would have ended in my own horrible
death had it not been for Shang. I thought of my last glimpse of
the monster, of his sacrifice, looked at the woman for whom he had
made that sacrifice, and contrasted the two dazedly. Shang had been
evil, a prowling, dangerous monster, but his evil had come from a
darkened mind. Hers was the greater sin!</p>

<p>Nan looked up at me. "She's dying, Hal." I bent, swiftly. There
was no beauty left in that mangled face, only the hard lines of an
evil life, the tortured lines of pain that wracked her even in her
coma. Her eyelids flickered open, terror flared in the gray orbs
that I had last seen aflame with foul passion.</p>

<p>Terror flamed in them, and died away. She smiled, actually
smiled. Her bloody lips moved, faint words whispered from them. I
bent closer. "Kiss me, Harold," she breathed. "Kiss me."</p>

<p>Her blood was salty on my lips. She quivered, her eyes glazed,
and life fled from her with a sigh. But the smile remained,
hovering about her mouth, the smile that showed she had died as she
had lived. Died with the thrill of passion obliterating all
else.</p>

<p>"Hal!" Nan's voice broke into my brief thoughts. "Hal. Listen!" I
was suddenly aware of a thumping echoing about me, a pounding of
fists against wood. "We've got to get away from here, they'll have
the door down in a minute."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "I'll say we must." I grasped her
wrist, started of. "We'll try upstairs." The battering of the maniac
horde echoed around us in the passage, menacing. And there was
something else in the passage, a red glare, the crackle of flames.
I realized suddenly what the roaring in my ears was, why I had been
able to see the dying woman's face so clearly. The fire from below
was gaining headway, was roaring up the staircase ahead, the
staircase that was our only path to safety! And behind wood
splintered, and the howl of the lunatic pack was more distinct.</p>

<p>We broke into a run, exhaustion forgotten, plunged around the
last curve in the tunneled corridor. At its end great tongues of
flame roared, red flame shot through with yellow, with virulent
green. Behind a tremendous crash sounded, and thundering footsteps
echoed warning of the oncoming swarm. We were caught between the
blaze of hot, devouring flame and the bloody mouths, the gory,
tearing claws of the shrieking mob that was hunting us down at
last.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; PERFECT TIMING</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was no choice, no choice at all. Rather
death in the flames than what those mad men and women would do to
us! Not pausing in my desperate run, I ripped off the tattered
remnants of my coat, flung it around Nan's head, her golden hair.
Then I had her in my arms, the roaring chimney of fire was just
ahead, and I had plunged into it.</p>

<p>I held my breath and my eyes were shut as the glare, the heat
enfolded me. My eyes were shut, but a picture of that landing, the
two staircases, was clear in my mind. I lunged for the one
ascending, felt its steps under my feet, pounded upward. Heat
swirled about me, heat that singed my hair, charred my skin. Heat
swirled about me, diminished as I fled upward and a cooler breath
told me I was through the flames, that I dared breathe again.</p>

<p>My eyes opened, I saw the upper corridor stretching before me,
the long rows of closed and numbered doors. Pain seared me where
the flames had burned, but a great joy flared within me. I had won
through, won through with Nan! I had plunged through the fire at
the last possible moment of escape, and nothing could stop me now.
Somehow I would get out of here, get Nan out of here. I knew it
then; despite the deadly peril we still were in I knew that I
should win through.</p>

<p>I set the girl down, pulled the coat away from her head. Her
face, her glorious hair, were untouched. "All right, Nan?" I
gasped.</p>

<p>Her eyes were aglow. "All right, Hal. But you?"</p>

<p>"A little charred, but I'll do. Lots of fight in me yet, and
we're going to need it." I grinned. "One thing we've got to thank
that fire for, those fellows can't get through it at this end, and
the steel gate down there will keep them back at the other. We've
only one problem now, how to get out of here ourselves."</p>

<p>Panic came back into her face. "But Hal, we can't. The only way
out is down again. The windows up here are all barred. We're shut
in. Oh Hal," fear strained her voice, "we're trapped up here to
burn."</p>

<p>That fear was echoed in my own heart. And then I remembered!
"No, Nan. The windows are not all barred. There's one in that
room," I pointed to the door through which a white arm had beckoned
me, was it only an hour ago, "through which we can climb."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Hal? Sure?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. We'll be out of here in minutes. Nothing more
is going to happen to us in this place."</p>

<p>I spoke confidently, but I was wrong. Dead wrong.</p>

<p>WE WERE in the luxuriously furnished room where still clung the
warm, musky scent of the woman who lay, stripped of clothing and
life itself, somewhere below. Dusk was already graying the window
as I pulled up the sash and looked out. There was grass, below, a
lawn edged by a tall hedge. Grass...across which a red light
danced. I pulled my head in quickly, that red light told me that
time pressed, that the rooms below must be a roaring furnace by
now. "Hurry, Nan," I grated. "We'll tear these sheets in ribbons,
make a rope-ladder to climb out."</p>

<p>She had anticipated my suggestion, had pulled the silk
counterpane back, was dragging the white linen from the bed. I took
a sheet, started to rip it...and stopped as a dull pounding sounded
from without!</p>

<p>Nan put a shaking hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Hal&mdash;that sound?" she quavered.</p>

<p>"Sounds like some poor devil caught in his room up here. I'll go
and see...you get these sheets torn."</p>

<p>The corridor was already filled with a haze of pungent smoke,
through which lurid luminance flickered. The thumping was coming
from my left, from the end room. I ran to it&mdash;the number was
twenty-four&mdash;and jerked the door open. Jerked the door open
and fell back, my jaw dropping as I stared at the apparition
within.</p>

<p>The room reeled about me, the floor heaved. A bubbling scream
rose to my lips&mdash;I choked it back and pawed at the swirling
air. Good God! This little man, gray hair, shaggy eyebrows over
deep-set, somber eyes&mdash;was my father! Dad! Great Heavens! It
couldn't be&mdash;it couldn't be! Dad, my dad was dead!</p>

<p>Now again, for one horrible instant, the old terror flooded back
on me, the old fear that I was insane! Insane&mdash;seeing visions,
hallucinations, things that were not, that could not be! Then a
familiar voice broke through to my swimming brain. "Hal! Hal my
boy!"</p>

<p>Dad's fragile hands reached out to me. Even in that moment it
wrung my heart to see how lined his countenance was with suffering,
how old he was. "Hal! It can't be. It can't be Hal!"</p>

<p>Flame was roaring behind me, black smoke swirled around us. But
I did not know it. "It is," I screamed. "It is Hal, Dad." Light
flashed in his old face for an instant, then it went blank. He
reeled, would have fallen had I not caught him. I lifted him, slung
him to my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hurry, Hal, Hurry!" Nan's voice calling from the room where was
the only exit. "The fire..."</p>

<p>"Coming," I gritted, and staggered toward the voice. "Coming." I
needed the guidance of her. "Hal! In here," for the smoke-fog was
dense now in the corridor, impenetrable. Choking, spluttering, I
reeled into the room, heard the door slam behind me. Fresh air from
the window revived me.</p>

<p>"I've got the rope ready, tied and tested," Nan said in my ear.
My clearing vision saw that this was true, that she had shoved the
bed to the window and knotted the long streamer of torn sheeting to
one of its posts.</p>

<p>"All right, dear. Slide down, and I'll let dad down to you."</p>

<p>"Dad?" her voice shrilled with surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. My father. And they told me he was dead! But hurry."</p>

<hr>

<p>I was crouched behind the hedge that ran along what seemed a
street. I was chafing dad's old hands as he lay outstretched on the
grass. Nan was beside me, crouching too. Behind us was pandemonium,
maniacal screams, bestial howls racketing from the dark bulk of the
asylum we had escaped, a dark bulk broken by oblong holes of red
flame striped by black bars of steel. Overhead the high arch of a
bridge loomed, a high arch I knew. It was Hell Gate Bridge!</p>

<p>"We're in Astoria, Nan," I muttered. "Astoria."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I know. Oh Hal, he isn't...?"</p>

<p>"No. Just fainted. He'll be all right." Feet thudded along the
street I peered through the hedge, saw brass buttons and the blue
coat of a policeman. He was reaching under his coat for a gun, his
face was white and staring as he pounded toward the madhouse where
all hell had broken loose. I started to call to him&mdash;and
choked the cry off just in time.</p>

<p>Good Lord! I&mdash;an escaped lunatic&mdash;a madman loose from
a place where my fellows were tearing their keepers to
bits&mdash;had been about to call to the law! If I had Nan and dad
and I would have been prisoners again, prisoners with all the long
intricacy of the law's red tape to unravel! I shuddered. Never
again would I be behind steel bars&mdash;never again.</p>

<p>A fire siren sounded, far off.</p>

<p>A new terror closed in on me&mdash;now, the terror of the
hunted. We were pariahs, outcasts, and every man's hand against us.
"Hal," Nan whispered. "He's awfully cold. I'm afraid..."</p>

<p>A police whistle shrilled out in the street, glass smashed
behind me as the officer already there broke a window to find
entrance. I must get away, must find a hiding place for Dad and
Nan...but where? In all New York...the answer flashed on me...in
all New York there was only one haven of safety for us, the old
Armour mansion on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>The second policeman rushed across the fire-lit lawn. The fire
sirens, the clangor of fire-bells, were nearer now, much nearer. I
must act, act now, before these grounds were a mass of men, before
we were discovered here under the hedge. But how...how get to
sanctuary across Queens, over a long bridge that would be an
inescapable trap, across half New York?</p>

<p>Brakes squealed out on the street, and tires scraped. I peered
again through the leafy barrier that hid us. A taxi had stopped,
and its driver leaned out, gazing curiously at the blazing building
set far back on its sloping lawn.</p>

<p>It was no conscious plan that lifted me to my feet, that sent me
hurdling over the hedge, that threw me headlong across the walk and
fastened my hands around the startled throat of that cabman before
a sound could rip from it. Before he could cry out&mdash;but not
before panic, terror, could stare from his bulging eyes to remain
in my memory forever. I thumped his head against the steel post of
his hack. He went limp under my hands, and I had hauled him out of
his seat, had flung him over the hedge and was myself in shadow
again in seconds. Seconds only it took for the desperate deed! Poor
fellow&mdash;he must wake at night to see a wild-eyed,
murderous-visaged maniac leap at him from the night, to see
clutching hands reach for his throat...</p>

<p>"Run for the cab, Nan," I grunted, as I tore off his cap, his
coat. "Run." She obeyed, and I was close behind her with the
cabbie's coat on my own frame, his cap on my head, and Dad's still
limp form in my arms. I pushed my father in through the rear door,
to Nan's waiting arms, and then I was behind the wheel, the motor
was roaring to life, and the cab was gliding away from the flaming
pyre where we had all endured so much.</p>

<p>If the capture of the taxi was an explosion of action during
which time did not move at all, the slow drive that followed was an
infinite unreeling of tortured crawling. I dared not speed, I dared
violate no rule of the road; every red light glared danger at me,
every policeman was a beetle-browed menace. But I knew that in the
darkness of the cab behind me were my father, my old father
returned from the dead&mdash;and the girl I loved!</p>

<p>Here at last, was the Park on my left. Dark facades flicked
past, and there was the squat, red-gabled mansion where I was born.
Home! But&mdash;I gasped and my blood ran cold once more&mdash;from
an upper window, wide and arch-topped, yellow light streamed! I
groaned. Someone was in the house! Someone was in the upstairs
sitting-room! Oh God! Was it not over yet? Were the police waiting
here for us, outguessing my plans?</p>

<p>There were people on the sidewalk, a bus crawled past. I dared
not hesitate a second&mdash;cabs were not allowed to park on this
sacrosanct Avenue. The opening in the high fence invited me, where
the driveway curved to the <i>porte-cochère.</i> I wheeled the cab
in there, followed the old path around to the rear of the house,
throttling the engine down to a merest whisper. The stables were
still back there, long unused.</p>

<p>How I blessed my father then for his refusal to yield to my
urging that he tear those stables down and sell the useless ground.
"You can do that after I die, Hal," he had said. "It was like that
when I brought your mother here and like that it shall remain till
I join her." Now, in our dire need, the ruined barn offered a
hiding place for the cab and its precious load.</p>

<p>I slipped from my seat, glanced in back. Dad seemed to be
asleep, so quietly he lay, his head pillowed in Nan's lap. "Stay
here a minute, dear," I whispered. "I want to take a look-see
before I bring you and father into the house."</p>

<p>Something in my tone must have alarmed her, though I had tried
to keep it even. "Hal. Is anything wrong? Is..."</p>

<p>"No," I lied. "I just want to be careful. Can't afford to take
chances now. Be a good girl and wait here quietly till I call
you."</p>

<p>I turned away, as memories of boyhood flooded back. There was a
drainpipe at the corner of the structure here, a pantry roof that
jutted out, and a pillar that one could climb. Soundlessly I moved,
soundlessly I climbed. Just as I had done, long ago, on many a
childish escapade. But no excitement throbbed in my veins tonight.
Only fear. Fear for dad, and Nan. Only fear.</p>

<p>The window to my old room scraped only slightly as I raised it,
but it brought my heart into my mouth. I froze, listening. A
distant murmur of voices came to me, but no indication that I had
been heard. I slid over the sill, into darkness.</p>

<p>White shapes loomed in the gloom. For an instant I was startled,
then realized they were the furniture with dust sheets thrown over.
I knew every inch of this place, every creaking board. It would
have been a sharp ear indeed that could have heard my passage as I
flitted through silent, familiar rooms.</p>

<p>Now I was in the dark hall, was slithering toward where a line
of light edged drawn portières to show the occupied room. I was
near enough to hear glasses clink, and a toast, in Avery Dunn's
oily, hateful voice. "Here's to the Armour estate, my dear fellow.
Long may we administer it."</p>

<p>Another voice answered, a voice I had often heard in this house,
<i>Carl Humperdinck's quavering, age-thinned voice!</i> Good Lord!
"I&mdash;I don't know whether I ought to drink that toast. I&mdash;when I saw
the boy this morning my heart sank. That fine youngster..."</p>

<p>"Stop!" Dunn's command cracked across the old man's trembling
accents. "Stop right there. You're in this thing too deep to turn
back. You started it, and you're going to finish it. The time to
get cold feet was at the beginning."</p>

<p>Uncle Carl groaned. "Yes. Yes, I know. But when you came to me
and threatened me with that old misdeed of mine I thought so safely
hidden I lost my head. I was old, old and I knew the disgrace of
exposure would kill me. I was weak, and you led me on slyly. You
said all you wanted was some inside information about some of the
families for whom I was attorney. I didn't know that it would lead
to...these hellish plots of yours. Two fine young people driven
mad," my head snapped up to that, "my oldest friend
murdered..."</p>

<p>"Not murdered," Dunn put in, silkily. "Not murdered. The old man
Armour is still alive...I confess I don't like the thought of the
electric chair you people reserve for...killers...in this
country."</p>

<p>I heard a chair tip over as the old man jumped to his feet
"Still alive!" he quavered. "My God! Where...where is he?"</p>

<p>Dunn laughed. "In the same place as his son, and your other
little client, Nancy Holmes," My teeth gritted at that, and the red
mists gathered before my eyes once more. So Nan was their victim
too, she was sane, sane as I! But I did not move. I wanted to hear
more. "A false bulkhead in my stateroom on Armour's own yacht, a
rowboat stealing through the night from her berth in the Sound, and
the thing was done. Sit down, you old fool, and drink. At least you
haven't got that on your conscience."</p>

<p>Liquid gulped down an old throat. Humperdinck's speech
thickened. "Not on my conscience. No. An' Hal...not on my
conscience either. He...he is really insane isn't he?" There was a
pleading note in the question. "He did attack you in your office,
did have hallucinations. Crazy...crazy as a loon."</p>

<p>"No." Dunn's tone was suddenly boasting. "No, he wasn't crazy
then!"</p>

<p>"Not crazy! But how could that be? Surely he was posed, with a
knife in his hand, when your clerk broke in, ready to plunge it in
your heart."</p>

<p>"Of course he was. But I had posed him like that." I leaned
closer, the blood thumping in my temples. So it had been a fraud,
that mad scene in the man's office. <i>A fraud!</i> "That little
scene was my masterpiece. I must tell you about it, my dear
ancient.</p>

<p>"You see," he went on. "I have two men whom I can trust
absolutely; Hassim, an Indian Dacoit, and Abdul. When young Armour
burst into my office, as I expected he would, Hassim was posted
behind the side door. At the proper moment I signaled him, and he
called out, 'Hal. Hal Armour! Watch out!' You should have seen
young Armour's face when he heard that. I almost laughed in his
face."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. But what happened then?"</p>

<p>"Hassim choked, then cried out for help. Armour dived for the
door, flung it open. Just as I figured he would from the
information you gave us as to his character. Hassim had turned
around. He had his own hands at his throat, and a big mirror in the
opposite wall that made the room appear twice as long as it really
is wide, also reflected him so that it seemed to Armour that there
were two men struggling."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he see the reflection of the doorway where he
stood?"</p>

<p>"The mirror was canted a bit, so that it would not show that.
And besides, the fellow had time only to glimpse the apparent fight
before I threw a knife past his head and into a bladder of red ink
Hassim had under the back of his coat. That twisted Armour around,
and he saw the second knife poised in my hand. He leaped for me,
and the instant he did so Hassim pulled a lever that turned a
section of the wall in my office around, so that the door was
hidden and the wall was solidly lined with bookshelves. After that
Hassim had plenty of time to adjust matters in that other room so
that it was utterly different from what Armour saw. It was all a
matter of perfect timing, my dear sir. Perfect timing. As the young
fellow grabbed the knife from me by the hilt, Abdul appeared, stark
naked, and shouted some meaningless phrase at him. Armour whipped
to him, and I knocked him out with the seal that was ready in my
hand. It was really very simple."</p>

<p>"But where did Abdul come from? Surely you did not trust all
your office-workers with the secret of what you were up to?"</p>

<p>"Small chance. My outer office door is between two large
pillars. One of them is genuine. The other is hollow, and has a
secret entrance to my room. I keep the black fellow there in case
of trouble. He popped out from there, did his job, and slipped back
before Barclay came in. Nobody saw him."</p>

<p>I felt my jaw hardening, the hot blood rushing to my head. The
devil, the arrant devil! Coldly, deliberately, he had planned to
make me insane, to all the world, and to myself. My fists clenched,
and my leg-muscles quivered for a leap. But the old lawyer was
talking again. Perhaps there would be more revelations. I held
myself in leash.</p>

<p>"I see now how it was done." There was awe in the ancient's
accents, awe, and fear. "That ingenious scheme certainly condemned
him as insane from his own mouth. The girl was easy, of course. She
was so cast down when her widowed mother died, so dazed, that it
was simple to get a commitment for her as a melancholic. But there
are State inspections of the asylums. What if either, or both,
prove themselves cured?"</p>

<p>Dunn laughed shortly. "By the time there is an inspection they
will be really crazy. Leave that to Irma&mdash;and her charming
little pet, Shang. That dear collaborator of mine is not only the
consummate actress she proved herself when she won her way into the
older Armour's confidence, using your information to build up her
character as his long-lost sister. She is also an adept at the work
she is doing now. It is marvelous to see her at it. With the
brainless giant to aid her she plays on the emotions of her
victims, on those strongest emotions a man can have, passion and
terror, till their brains are blasted to utter darkness. As for the
girl&mdash;one look at Shang's face as he creeps toward her in the
dark; one feel of his hairy paws?"</p>

<p>That was enough for me! "You devil," I shouted, and catapulted
through the draperies. I saw Humperdinck's startled, staring face,
flushed with drink, saw Dunn's slant-eyed, yellow face. I leaped
for the Eurasian. "How's this for timing?" I yelled, and my fist
crashed into his thin nose. "And this?" The other one pulped his
gaping mouth. He hurtled away, sprawled across a sofa. I whipped
around to the lawyer. "As for you..."</p>

<p>He was backing away, his face livid. But it was not the sheer
terror staring from his bleared eyes that choked the words in my
mouth; it was the towering black apparition behind him, the Negro I
had seen before, clothed now, but with that same snouting automatic
menacing me. His lips drew away from gleaming, file-pointed teeth,
I saw his finger tighten on the trigger...</p>

<p>Something white flashed from the parting of the portières,
crashed against the black's gun elbow just as his gat belched
flame. A scream shrilled in my ears as I lunged across the floor
and got in a blow at the Negro's face before he could shoot again,
was swallowed in a whirlwind, shouting melee of combat through
which furniture crashed, thudding blows rocked me and pain shot up
my arm from bruised knuckles as I pounded at a rock-like head.</p>

<p>"Hal," someone shouted. "His stomach, Hal. His stomach."</p>

<p>I shifted my attack, sank my fist in the soft belly of my
antagonist. And he crumpled up like a pricked balloon, crumpled up
and rolled in agony on the floor.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Hal." I twisted. Dad! My old dad was standing in the
doorway, a tired smile on his dear face. His arm was around Nan,
whose countenance was a jumble of tears and smiles.</p>

<p>"Dad! Was it you who?"</p>

<p>"Threw my best Sevres vase that stood out here in the hall? No.
It was this blonde young lady. I woke up, out there. She told me
where we were, that you had gone into the house. She was sure that
something was wrong but feared to leave me. I remembered a broken
window-lock below. We got in the house, heard you yelling up here.
Girl ran ahead. I got here too late to save my vase." His old eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>"Dear old Dad. Still up and coming. And Nan. My glorious, golden
girl." I started toward them. A moan from the floor distracted me.
I looked down, saw old Humperdinck breathing his last. The bullet
intended for me, deflected by the thrown vase, had found its billet
in him. I moved so as to screen the sight from dad.</p>

<p>"Nan. There's a 'phone in the alcove behind you. You had better
call the police."</p>

<p>"The police!" I saw fear flash, for the last time I hope, into
her eyes. "But..."</p>

<p>"No," I said gently, striding to her. "No! I have nothing to be
afraid of now. There's proof here that I am sane&mdash;utterly
sane. And here's further proof." I seized her, pulled her to me.
And my lips found hers at last.</p>

<p>"I'll say you're sane," I heard dad chuckle. "Too damn sane to
suit me."</p>

<p>So, as it turned out, I was not insane. At least not insane
enough to be committed to a madhouse. Nor, I will admit, are you.
But are you sure, dead sure, that you will never be?</p>

<p>Think about it, tonight, when all the lights are out and you
stare into a darkness where a faceless something may be lurking,
its curved claws reaching noiselessly for your throat.</p>
