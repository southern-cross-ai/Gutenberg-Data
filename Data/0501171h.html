    <p>
      Certainly the breakfast tongue, which was cut for the first
      time that morning, was not of the pleasant reddish hue
      which Mrs. Altham was justified in expecting, considering
      that the delicacy in question was not an ordinary tinned
      tongue (you had to take things as you found them, if your
      false sense of economy led you to order tinned goods) but
      one that came out of a fine glass receptacle with an
      eminent label on it. It was more of the colour of cold
      mutton, unattractive if not absolutely unpleasant to the
      eye, while to the palate it proved to be singularly lacking
      in flavour. Altogether it was a great disappointment, and
      for this reason, when Mr. Altham set out at a quarter-past
      twelve to stroll along to the local club in Queensgate
      Street with the ostensible purpose of seeing if there was
      any fresh telegram about the disturbances in Morocco, his
      wife accompanied him to the door of that desirable mansion,
      round which was grouped a variety of chained-up dogs in
      various states of boredom and irritation, and went on into
      the High Street in order to make in person a justifiable
      complaint at her grocer's. She would be sorry to have to
      take her custom elsewhere, but if Mr. Pritchard did not see
      his way to sending her another tongue (of course without
      further charge) she would be obliged . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      So this morning there was a special and imperative reason
      why Mrs. Altham should walk out before lunch to the High
      Street, and why her husband should make a morning visit to
      the club. But to avoid misconception it may be stated at
      once that there was, on every day of the week except
      Sunday, some equally compelling cause to account for these
      expeditions. If it was very wet, perhaps, Mrs. Altham might
      not go to the High Street, but wet or fine her husband went
      to his club. And exactly the same thing happened in the
      case of most of their friends and acquaintances, so that
      Mr. Altham was certain of meeting General Fortescue, Mr.
      Brodie, Major Ames, and others in the smoking-room, while
      Mrs. Altham encountered their wives and sisters on errands
      like her own in the High Street. She often professed
      superior distaste for gossip, but when she met her friends
      coming in and out of shops, it was but civil and reasonable
      that she should have a few moments' chat with them. Thus,
      if any striking events had taken place since the previous
      afternoon, they all learned about them. Simultaneously
      there was a similar interchange of thought and tidings
      going on in the smoking-room at the club, so that when Mr.
      Altham had drunk his glass of sherry and returned home to
      lunch at one-thirty, there was probably little of
      importance and interest which had not reached the ears of
      himself or his wife. It could then be discussed at that
      meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queensgate Street ran at right-angles to the High Street,
      debouching into that thoroughfare at the bottom of its
      steep slope, while the grocer's shop lay at the top of it.
      The morning was a hot day of early June, but to a woman of
      Mrs. Altham's spare frame and active limbs, the ascent was
      no more than a pleasurable exercise, and the vivid colour
      of her face (so unlike the discouraging hues of the
      breakfast tongue) was not the result of her exertions. It
      was habitually there, and though that and the restlessness
      of her dark and rather beady eyes might have made a doctor,
      on a cursory glance (especially if influenza was about),
      think that she suffered from some slight rise of
      temperature, he would have been in error. Her symptoms
      betokened not an unnatural warmth of the blood, but were
      the visible sign of her eager and slightly impatient mind.
      Like the inhabitants of ancient Athens, she was always on
      the alert to hear some new thing (though she disliked
      gossip), but her mind appreciated the infinitesimal more
      than the important. The smaller a piece of news was, the
      more vivid was her perception of it, and the firmer her
      grip of it: large questions produced but a vague impression
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, a retired solicitor, was singularly
      well-adapted to be the partner of her life, for his mind
      was very much akin to hers, and his appetite for news no
      less rapacious. Indeed, the chief difference between them
      in this respect was that she snapped at her food like a
      wolf in winter, whereas he took it quietly, in the manner
      of a leisurely boa-constrictor. But his capacity was in no
      way inferior to hers. Similarly, they practised the same
      harmless hypocrisies on each other, and politely forbore to
      question each other's sincerity. An instance has already
      been recorded where such lack of trust might have been
      manifested, but it never entered Mrs. Altham's head to tell
      her husband just now that he cared nothing whatever about
      the disturbances in Morocco, while she would have thought
      it very odd conduct on his part to suggest that a sharply
      worded note to Mr. Pritchard would save her the walk uphill
      on this hot morning. But it was only sensible to go on
      their quests; had they not ascertained if there was any
      news, they would have had nothing to talk about at lunch.
      As it was, conversation never failed them, for this little
      town of Riseborough was crammed with interest and incident,
      for all who felt a proper concern in the affairs of other
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The High Street this morning was very full, for it was
      market-day, and Mrs. Altham's progress was less swift than
      usual. Barrows of itinerant vendors were crowded into the
      road from the edge of the pavements, leaving a straitened
      channel for a traffic swelled by farmers' carts and
      occasional droves of dusty and perplexed looking cattle,
      being driven in from the country round. More than once Mrs.
      Altham had to step into the doorway of some shop to avoid
      the random erring of a company of pigs or sheep which made
      irruption on to the pavement. But it was interesting to
      observe, in one such enforced pause, the impeded passage of
      Sir James Westbourne's motor, with the owner, broad-faced
      and good-humoured, driving himself, and to conjecture as to
      what business brought him into the town. Then she saw that
      there was his servant sitting in the body of the car, while
      there were two portmanteaus on the luggage-rail behind.
      There was no need for further conjecture: clearly he was
      coming from the South-Eastern station at the top of the
      hill, and was driving out to his place four miles distant
      along the Maidstone road. Then he caught sight of somebody
      on the pavement whom he knew, and, stopping the car,
      entered into conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Mrs. Altham could not see who it was; then,
      as the car moved on again, there appeared from behind it
      the tall figure of Dr. Evans. Mrs. Altham was not so
      foolish as to suppose that their conversation had
      necessarily anything to do with medical matters; she did
      not fly to the conclusion that Lady Westbourne or any of
      the children must certainly be ill. To a person of her
      mental grasp it was sufficient to remember that Mrs. Evans
      was Sir James' first cousin. She heard also the baronet's
      cheerful voice as the two parted, saying, "Saturday the
      twenty-eighth, then. I'll tell my wife." That, of course,
      settled it; it required only a moment's employment of her
      power of inference to make her feel convinced that Saturday
      the twenty-eighth would be the date for Mrs. Evans'
      garden-party. There were a good many garden-parties in
      Riseborough about then, for strawberries might be expected
      to be reasonably cheap. Probably the date had been settled
      only this morning; she might look forward to receiving the
      "At-Home" card (four to seven) by the afternoon post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The residential quarters of Riseborough lay both at the top
      of the hill, on which the town stood, clustering round the
      fine old Norman church, and at the bottom, along Queensgate
      Street, which passed into the greater spaciousness of St.
      Barnabas Road. On the whole, that might be taken to be the
      Park Lane of the place, and commanded the highest rents;
      every house there, in addition to being completely
      detached, had a small front garden with a carriage drive
      long enough to hold three carriages simultaneously, if each
      horse did not mind putting its nose within rubbing distance
      of the carriage in front of it, while the foremost
      projected a little into the road again. But there were good
      houses also at the top of the hill, where Dr. Evans lived,
      and those who lived below naturally considered themselves
      advantageously-placed in being sheltered from the bleak
      easterly winds which often prevailed in spring, while those
      at the top wondered among themselves in sultry summer days
      how it was possible to exist in the airless atmosphere
      below. The middle section of the town was mercantile, and
      it was here that the ladies of the place, both from above
      and below, met each other with such invariable
      fortuitousness in the hours before lunch. To-day, however,
      though the street was so full, it was for purposes of
      news-gathering curiously deserted, and apart from the
      circumstance of inferentially learning the date of Mrs.
      Evans' garden-party, Mrs. Altham found nothing to detain
      her until she had got to the very door of Mr. Pritchard's
      grocery. But there her prolonged fast was broken; Mrs.
      Taverner was ready to give and receive, and after the
      business of the colourless tongue was concluded in a manner
      that was perfectly creditable to Mr. Pritchard, the two
      ladies retraced their steps (for Mrs. Taverner was of St.
      Barnabas Road) down the hill again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Taverner quite agreed about the strong probability of
      Mrs. Evans' garden-party being on the twenty-eighth; and
      proceeded to unload herself of far more sensational
      information. She talked rather slowly, but without ever
      stopping of her own accord, so that she got as much into a
      given space of time as most people. Even if she was
      temporarily stopped by an interruption, she kept her mouth
      open, so as to be able to proceed at the earliest possible
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, three weeks, as you say, is a long notice, is it
      not?" she said; "but I'm sure people are wise to give long
      notice, otherwise they will find all their guests are
      already engaged, such a quantity of parties as there will
      be this summer. Mrs. Ames has sent out dinner-cards for
      exactly the same date, I am told. I daresay they agreed
      together to have a day full of gaiety. Perhaps you are
      asked to dine there on the twenty-eighth, Mrs. Altham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, it will be news to you," said Mrs. Taverner,
      "if what I have heard is true, and it was Mrs. Fortescue's
      governess who told me; whom I met taking one of the
      children to the dentist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be Edward," said Mrs. Altham unerringly. "I
      have often noticed his teeth are most irregular: one here,
      another there."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as if it was more usual for children to have all
      their teeth on the same spot, but Mrs. Taverner understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely; indeed, I think I have noticed it myself.
      Well, what I have to tell you seems very irregular, too;
      Edward's teeth are nothing to it. It was talked about, so
      Miss--I can never recollect her name, and, from what I
      hear, I do not think Mrs. Fortescue finds her very
      satisfactory--it was talked about, so Mrs. Fortescue's
      governess told me, at breakfast time, and it was agreed
      that General Fortescue should accept, for if you are asked
      three weeks ahead it is no use saying you are engaged. No
      doubt Mrs. Ames gave that long notice for that very
      reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is it that is so irregular?" asked Mrs. Altham,
      nearly dancing with impatience at these circumlocutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not tell you? Ah, there is Mrs. Evans; I was told
      she was asked too, without her husband. How slowly she
      walks; I should not be surprised if her husband had told
      her never to hurry. She did not see us; otherwise we might
      have found out more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About what?" asked the martyred Mrs. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what I am saying. Mrs. Ames has asked General
      Fortescue to dine that night, without asking Mrs.
      Fortescue, and has asked Mrs. Evans to dine without asking
      Dr. Evans. I don't know who the rest of the party are. I
      must try to find time this afternoon to call on Mrs. Ames,
      and see if she lets anything drop about it. It seems very
      odd to ask a husband without his wife, and a wife without
      her husband. And we do not know yet whether Dr. Evans will
      allow his wife to go there without him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham was suitably astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I never heard of such a thing," she said, "and I
      expect my memory is as" (she nearly said "long," but
      stopped in time) "clear and retentive as that of most
      people. It seems very strange: it will look as if General
      Fortescue and his wife are not on good terms, and, as far
      as I know, there is no reason to suppose that. However, it
      is none of my business, and I am thankful to say that I do
      not concern myself with things that do not concern me. Had
      Mrs. Ames wanted my advice as to the desirability of asking
      a husband without a wife, or a wife without a husband, I
      should have been very glad to give it her. But as she has
      not asked it, I must suppose that she does not want it, and
      I am sure I am very thankful to keep my opinion to myself.
      But if she asked me what I thought about it, I should be
      compelled to tell her the truth. I am very glad to be
      spared any such unpleasantness. Dear me, here I am at home
      again. I had no idea we had come all this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Taverner seemed inclined to linger, but the other had
      caught sight of her husband's face looking out of the
      window known as his study, where he was accustomed to read
      the paper in the morning, and go to sleep in the evening.
      This again was very irregular, for the watch on her wrist
      told her that it was not yet a quarter-past one, the hour
      at which he invariably ordered a glass of sherry at the
      club, to fortify him for his walk home. Possibly he had
      heard something about this revolutionary social scheme in
      the club, and had hastened his return in order to be able
      to talk it over with her without delay. For a moment it
      occurred to her to ask Mrs. Taverner to join them at lunch,
      but, after all, she had heard what that lady had to tell,
      and one of the smaller bundles of asparagus could not be
      considered ample for more than two. So she checked the
      hospitable impulse, and hurried into his study, alert with
      suppressed information, though she did not propose to let
      it explode at once, for the method of them both was to let
      news slip out as if accidentally. And, even as she crossed
      the hall, an idea for testing the truth of what she had
      heard, which was both simple and ingenious, came into her
      head. She despised poor Mrs. Taverner's scheme of calling
      on Mrs. Ames, in the hope of her letting something drop,
      for Mrs. Ames never let things drop in that way, though she
      was an adept at picking them up. Her own plan was far more
      effective. Also it harmonized well with the system of
      mutual insincerities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been thinking, my dear," she said briskly, as she
      entered his study, "that it is time for us to be asking
      Major and Mrs. Ames to dinner again. Yes: Pritchard was
      reasonable, and will send me another tongue, and take back
      the old one, which I am sure I am quite glad that he should
      do, though it would have come in for savouries very
      handily. Still, he is quite within his rights, since he
      does not charge for it, and I should not think of
      quarrelling with him because he exercises them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham was as keen a housekeeper as his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Its colour would not have signified in a savoury," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but as Pritchard supplies a new tongue without charge,
      we cannot complain. About Mrs. Ames, now. We dined with
      them quite a month ago: I do not want her to think we are
      lacking in the exchange of hospitalities, which I am sure
      are so pleasant on both sides."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham considered this question, caressing the side of
      his face. There was no doubt that he had a short pointed
      beard on his chin, but about half-way up the jawbone the
      hair got shorter and shorter, and he was quite clean-shaven
      before it got up to his ear. It was always a question, in
      fact, among the junior and less respectful members of the
      club, whether old Altham had whiskers or not. The general
      opinion was that he had whiskers, but was unaware of that
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is odd that the idea of asking Mrs. Ames to dinner
      occurred to you to-day," he said, "for I was wondering also
      whether we did not owe her some hospitality. And Major
      Ames, of course," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham smiled a bright detective smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next week is impossible, I know," she said, "and so is the
      week after, as there is a perfect rush of engagements then.
      But after that, we might find an evening free. How would it
      suit you, if I asked Mrs. Ames and a few friends to dine on
      the Saturday of that week? Let me count--seven, fourteen,
      twenty-one, yes; on the twenty-eighth. I think that
      probably Mrs. Evans will have her garden-party on that day.
      It would make a pleasant ending to such an afternoon. And
      it would be less of an interruption to both of us, if we
      give up that day. It would be better than disarranging the
      week by sacrificing another evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham rang the bell before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is hardly likely that Major and Mrs. Ames would have an
      engagement so long ahead," he said. "I think we shall be
      sure to secure them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A glass of sherry," he said. "I forgot, my dear, to take
      my glass of sherry at the club. Young Morton was talking to
      me, though I don't know why I call him young, and I forgot
      about my sherry. Yes, I should think the twenty-eighth
      would be very suitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham waited until the parlour-maid had deposited the
      glass of sherry, and had completely left the room with a
      shut door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard a very extraordinary story to-day," she said,
      "though I don't for a moment believe it is true. If it is,
      we shall find that Mrs. Ames cannot dine with us on the
      twenty-eighth, but we shall have asked her with plenty of
      notice, so that it will count. But one never knows how
      little truth there may be in what Mrs. Taverner says, for
      it was Mrs. Taverner who told me. She said that Mrs. Ames
      has asked General Fortescue to dine with her that night,
      without asking Mrs. Fortescue, and has invited Mrs. Evans
      also without her husband. One doesn't for a moment believe
      it, but if we asked Mrs. Ames for the same night we should
      very likely hear about it. Was anything said at the club
      about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham affected a carelessness which he was very far
      from feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Morton did say something of the sort," he said. "I
      was not listening particularly, since, as you know, I went
      there to see if there was anything to be learned about
      Morocco, and I get tired of his tittle-tattle. But he did
      mention something of the kind. There is the luncheon-bell,
      my dear. You might write your note immediately and send it
      by hand, for James will be back from his dinner by now, and
      tell him to wait for an answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham adopted this suggestion at once. She knew, of
      course, perfectly well that the thrilling quality of the
      news had brought her husband home without waiting to take
      his glass of sherry at the club, a thing which had not
      happened since that morning a year ago, when he had learned
      that Mrs. Fortescue had dismissed her cook without a
      character, but she did not think of accusing him of
      duplicity. After all, it was the amiable desire to talk
      these matters over with her without the loss of a moment
      which was the motive at the base of his action, and so
      laudable a motive covered all else. So she had her note
      written with amazing speed and cordiality, and the
      boot-and-knife boy, who also exercised the function of the
      gardener, was instructed to wash his hands and go upon his
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Criticism of Mrs. Ames' action, based on the hypothesis
      that the news was true, was sufficient to afford brisk
      conversation until the return of the messenger, and Mrs.
      Altham put back on her plate her first stick of asparagus
      and tore the note open. A glance was sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all quite true," she said. "Mrs. Ames writes, 'We
      are so sorry to be obliged to refuse your kind invitation,
      but General Fortescue and Millicent Evans, with a few other
      friends, are dining with us this evening.' Well, I am sure!
      So, after all, Mrs. Taverner was right. I feel I owe her an
      apology for doubting the truth of it, and I shall slip
      round after lunch to tell her that she need not call on
      Mrs. Ames, which she was thinking of doing. I can save her
      that trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham considered and condemned the wisdom of this
      slipping round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That might land you in an unpleasantness, my dear," he
      said. "Mrs. Taverner might ask you how you were certain of
      it. You would not like to say that you asked the Ames' to
      dinner on the same night in order to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that is true. You see things very quickly, Henry. But,
      on the other hand, if Mrs. Taverner does go to call, Mrs.
      Ames might let drop the fact that she had received this
      invitation from us. I would sooner let Mrs. Taverner know
      it myself than let it get to her in roundabout ways. I will
      think over it; I have no doubt I shall be able to devise
      something. Now about Mrs. Ames' new departure. I must say
      that it seems to me a very queer piece of work. If she is
      to ask you without me, and me without you, is the other to
      sit at home alone for dinner? For it is not to be expected
      that somebody else will on the very same night always ask
      the other of us. As likely as not, if there is another
      invitation for the same night, it will be for both of us,
      for I do not suppose that we shall all follow Mrs. Ames'
      example, and model our hospitalities on hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham paused a moment to eat her asparagus, which was
      getting cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, my dear, we do usually follow Mrs.
      Ames' example," he said. "She may be said to be the leader
      of our society here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you gave me a hundred guesses why we do follow her
      example," said Mrs. Altham rather excitedly, picking up a
      head of asparagus that had fallen on her napkin, "I am sure
      I could not give you one answer that you would think
      sensible. There are a dozen of our friends in Riseborough
      who are just as well born as she is, and as many more much
      better off; not that I say that money should have anything
      to do with position, though you know as well as I do that
      you could buy their house over their heads, Henry, and
      afford to keep it empty, while, all the time, I, for one,
      don't believe that they have got three hundred a year
      between them over and above his pay. And as for breeding,
      if Mrs. Ames' manners seem to you so worthy of copy, I
      can't understand what it is you find to admire in them,
      except that she walks into a room as if it all belonged to
      her, and looks over everybody's head, which is very
      ridiculous, as she can't be more than two inches over five
      feet, and I doubt if she's as much. I never have been able
      to see, and I do not suppose I ever shall be able to see,
      why none of us can do anything in Riseborough without
      asking Mrs. Ames' leave. Perhaps it is my stupidity, though
      I do not know that I am more stupid than most."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Altham felt himself to blame for this agitated
      harangue. It was careless of him to have alluded to Mrs.
      Ames' leadership, for if there was a subject in this world
      that produced a species of frenzy and a complete absence of
      full-stops in his wife, it was that. Desperately before now
      had she attempted to wrest the sceptre from Mrs. Ames'
      podgy little hands, and to knock the crown off her
      noticeably small head. She had given parties that were
      positively Lucullan in their magnificence on her first
      coming to Riseborough; the regimental band (part of it, at
      least) had played under the elm-tree in her garden on the
      occasion of a mere afternoon-party, while at a dance she
      had given (a thing almost unknown in Riseborough) there had
      been a cotillion in which the presents cost up to five and
      sixpence each, to say nothing of the trouble. She had given
      a party for children at which there was not only a
      Christmas-tree, but a conjuror, and when a distinguished
      actor once stayed with her, she had, instead of keeping him
      to herself, which was Mrs. Ames' plan when persons of
      eminence were her guests, asked practically the whole of
      Riseborough to lunch, tea and dinner. To all of these great
      parties she had bidden Mrs. Ames (with a view to her
      deposition), and on certainly one occasion--that of the
      cotillion--she had heard afterwards unimpeachable evidence
      to show that that lady had remarked that she saw no reason
      for such display. Therefore to this day she had occasional
      bursts of volcanic amazement at Mrs. Ames' undoubted
      supremacy, and made occasional frantic attempts to deprive
      her of her throne. There was no method of attack which she
      had not employed; she had flattered and admired Mrs. Ames
      openly to her face, with a view to be permitted to share
      the throne; she had abused and vilified her with a view to
      pulling her off it; she had refrained from asking her to
      her own house for six months at a time, and for six months
      at a time she had refused to accept any of Mrs. Ames'
      invitations. But it was all no use; the vilifications, so
      she had known for a fact, had been repeated to Mrs. Ames,
      who had not taken the slightest notice of them, nor abated
      one jot of her rather condescending cordiality, and in
      spite of Mrs. Altham's refusing to come to her house, had
      continued to send her invitations at the usual rate of
      hospitality. Indeed, for the last year or two Mrs. Altham
      had really given up all thought of ever deposing her, and
      her husband, though on this occasion he felt himself to
      blame for this convulsion, felt also that he might
      reasonably have supposed the volcano to be extinct. Yet
      such is the disconcerting habit of these subliminal forces;
      they break forth with renewed energy exactly when persons
      of exactly average caution think that there is no longer
      any life in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to repair his error, and to calm the tempest,
      by fulsome agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear," he said, "certainly there is a great deal
      in what you say, for we have no reason to suppose that
      everybody will ask husband and wife singly, or that two of
      this new set of invitations will always come for the same
      night. Then, too, there is the question of carriage-hire,
      which, though it does not much matter to us, will be an
      important item to others. For, every time that husband and
      wife dine out, there will be two carriages needed instead
      of one. I wonder if Mrs. Ames had thought of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not she," said Mrs. Altham, whose indignation still oozed
      and spurted. "Why, as often as not, she comes on foot, with
      her great goloshes over her evening shoes. Ah, I have it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant idea struck her, which did much to restore her
      equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may depend upon it," she said, "that Mrs. Ames means
      to ask just husband or wife, as the case may be, and make
      that count. That will save her half the cost of her
      dinners, and now I come to think of it, I am sure I should
      not be surprised to learn that they have lost money lately.
      Major Ames may have been speculating, for I saw the
      <i>Financial News</i> on the table last time I was there. I
      daresay that is it. That would account, too, for the very
      poor dinner we got. Salmon was in season, I remember, but
      we only had plaice or something common, and the ordinary
      winter desert, just oranges and apples. You noticed it,
      too, Henry. You told me that you had claret that couldn't
      have cost more than eighteenpence a bottle, and but one
      glass of port afterwards. And the dinner before that,
      though there was champagne, I got little but foam. Poor
      thing! I declare I am sorry for her if that is the reason,
      and I am convinced it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham felt considerably restored by this explanation,
      and got briskly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I will just run round to Mrs. Taverner's," she
      said, "to tell her there is no need for her to call on Mrs.
      Ames, since you have heard the same story at the club, so
      that we can rest assured that it is true. That will do
      famously; it will account for everything. And there is
      Pritchard's cart at the gate. That will be the tongue. I
      wonder if he has told his man to take away the pale one. If
      not, as you say, it will serve for savouries."
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer had certainly come in earnest, and Mr. Altham, when
      he went out on to the shaded verandah to the east of the
      house, in order to smoke his cigar before going up to the
      golf-links, found that the thermometer registered eighty
      degrees in the shade. Consequently, before enjoying that
      interval of quiescence which succeeded his meals, and to
      which he felt he largely owed the serenity of his health,
      he went upstairs to change his cloth coat for the light
      alpaca jacket which he always wore when the weather was
      really hot. Last year, he remembered, he had not put it on
      at all until the end of July, except that on one occasion
      he wore it over his ordinary coat (for it was loosely made)
      taking a drive along an extremely dusty road. But the heat
      to-day certainly called for the alpaca jacket, and he
      settled himself in his chair (after tapping the barometer
      and observing with satisfaction that the concussion
      produced an upward tremor of the needle, which was at "Set
      Fair" already) feeling much more cool and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life in general was a very cool and comfortable affair to
      this contented gentleman. Even in youth he had not been of
      very exuberant vitality, and he had passed through his
      early years without giving a moment's anxiety to himself or
      his parents. Like a good child who eats and digests what is
      given him, so Mr. Altham, even in his early manhood, had
      accepted life exactly as he found it, and had seldom
      wondered what it was all about, or what it was made of. His
      emotions had been stirred when he met his wife, and he had
      once tried to write a poem to her--soon desisting, owing to
      the obvious scarcity of rhymes in the English language, and
      since then his emotional record had been practically blank.
      If happiness implies the power to want and to aspire, that
      quality must be denied him, but his content was so profound
      that he need not be pitied for the lack of the more
      effervescent emotions. All that he cared about was
      abundantly his: there was the <i>Times</i> to be read after
      breakfast, news to be gleaned at the club before lunch,
      golf to be played in the afternoon, and a little
      well-earned repose to be enjoyed before dinner, while at
      odd moments he looked at the thermometer and tapped the
      aneroid. He was distinctly kindly by nature, and would no
      doubt have cheerfully put himself to small inconveniences
      in order to lighten the troubles of others, but he hardly
      ever found it necessary to practise discomfort, since those
      with whom he associated were sunk in precisely the same
      lethargy of content as himself. Being almost completely
      devoid of imagination, no qualms or questionings as to the
      meaning of the dramas of life presented themselves to him,
      and his annual subscriptions to the local hospital and
      certain parish funds connoted no more to him than did the
      money he paid at the station for his railway ticket. He
      was, in fact, completely characteristic of the society of
      Riseborough, which largely consisted of men who had retired
      from their professions and spent their days, with
      unimportant variations, in precisely the same manner as he
      did. Necessarily they were not aware of the amazing
      emptiness of their lives, for if they had been, they would
      probably have found life very dull, and have tried to fill
      it with some sort of interest. As it was, golf, gardening,
      and gossip made the days pass so smoothly and quickly that
      it would really have been hazardous to attempt to infuse
      any life into them, for it might have produced upset and
      fermentation. But these chronicles would convey a very
      false impression if they made it seem as if life at
      Riseborough appeared dull or empty at Riseborough. The
      affairs of other people were so perennial a source of
      interest that it would only be a detached or sluggish mind
      that was not perpetually stimulated. And this stimulus was
      not of alcoholic character, nor was it succeeded by
      reaction and headache after undue indulgence. Mr. Altham
      woke each morning with a clean palate, so to speak, and an
      appetite and digestion quite unimpaired. As yet, he had not
      to seek to fill the hours of the day with gardening, like
      Major Ames, or with continuous rubbers of bridge in the
      card-room at the club; his days were full enough without
      those additional distractions, which he secretly rather
      despised as signs of senility, and wondered that Major
      Ames, who was still, he supposed, not much more than
      forty-five, should so soon have taken to a hobby that was
      better fitted for ladies and septuagenarians. It was not
      that he did not like flowers; he thought them pretty enough
      things in their place, and was pleased when he looked out
      of the bathroom window in the morning, and saw the neat row
      of red geraniums which ran along the border by the wall,
      between calceolarias and lobelias. Very likely when he was
      older, and other interests had faded, he might take to
      gardening, too; at present he preferred that the hired man
      should spend two days a week in superintending the
      operations of James. Certainly there would be some sense in
      looking after a vegetable garden, for there was an
      intelligible end in view there--namely, the production of
      early peas and giant asparagus for the table, but since the
      garden at Cambridge House was not of larger capacity than
      was occupied with a croquet lawn and a couple of flower
      borders, it was impossible to grow vegetables, and the
      production of a new red sweet-pea, about which Major Ames
      had really rendered himself tedious last summer, was quite
      devoid of interest to him, especially since there were
      plenty of other red flowers before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cigar was already half-smoked before he recalled
      himself from this pleasant vacancy of mind which had
      succeeded the summer resumal of his alpaca jacket, and for
      the ten minutes that still remained to him before the cab
      from the livery-stables which was to take him up the long
      hill to the golf-links would be announced, he roused
      himself to a greater activity of brain. It was natural that
      his game with Mr. Turner this afternoon should first occupy
      his thoughts. He felt sure he could beat him if only he
      paid a very strict attention to the game, and did not let
      his mind wander. A few days ago, Mr. Turner had won merely
      because he himself had been rather late in arriving at the
      club-house, and had started with the sense of hurry about
      him. But to-day he had ordered the cab at ten minutes to
      three, instead of at the hour. Thus he could both start
      from here and arrive there without this feeling of fuss.
      Their appointed hour was not till a quarter-past three, and
      it took a bare fifteen minutes to drive up. Also he had on
      his alpaca jacket; he would not, as on the last occasion of
      their encounter, be uncomfortably hot. As usual, he would
      play his adversary for the sum of half-a-crown; that should
      pay both for cab and caddie.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts took a wider range. Certainly it was a strange
      thing that Mrs. Ames should ask husbands without their
      wives, and wives without their husbands. Of course, to ask
      Mrs. Evans without the doctor was less remarkable than to
      ask General Fortescue without his wife, for it sometimes
      happened that Dr. Evans was sent for in the middle of
      dinner to attend on a patient, and once, when he was giving
      a party at his own house, he had received a note which led
      him to get up at once, and say to the lady on his right, "I
      am afraid I must go; maternity case," which naturally had
      caused a very painful feeling of embarrassment, succeeded
      by a buzz of feverish and haphazard conversation. But to
      ask General Fortescue without his wife was a very different
      affair; it was not possible that Mrs. Fortescue should be
      sent for in the middle of dinner, and cause dislocation in
      the party. He felt that if any hostess except Mrs. Ames had
      attempted so startling an innovation, she would, even with
      her three-weeks' notice, have received chilling refusals
      coupled with frankly incredible reasons for declining. Thus
      with growing radius of thought he found himself considering
      the case of Mrs. Ames' undoubted supremacy in the
      Riseborough world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of what his wife had said in her excited harangue had
      been perfectly well-founded. Mrs. Ames was not rich, and a
      marked parsimony often appeared to have presided over the
      ordering of her dinners; while, so far as birth was
      concerned, at least two other residents here were related
      to baronets just as much as she was; Mrs. Evans, for
      instance, was first cousin of the present Sir James
      Westbourne, whereas Mrs. Ames was more distant than that
      from the same fortunate gentleman by one remove. Her
      mother, that is to say, had been the eldest sister of the
      last baronet but one, and older than he, so that beyond any
      question whatever, if Mrs. Ames' mother had been a boy, and
      she had been a boy also, she would now have been a baronet
      herself in place of the cheerful man who had been seen by
      Mrs. Altham driving his motor-car down the High Street that
      morning. As for General Fortescue, he was the actual
      brother of a baronet, and there was the end of the matter.
      But though Riseborough in general had a very proper
      appreciation of the deference due to birth, Mr. Altham felt
      that Mrs. Ames' supremacy was not really based on so
      wholesale a rearrangement of parents and sexes. Nor, again,
      were her manners and breeding such as compelled homage; she
      seemed to take her position for granted, and very seldom
      thanked her hostess for "a very pleasant evening" when she
      went away. Nor was she remarkable for her good looks;
      indeed, she was more nearly remarkable for the absence of
      them. Yet, somehow, Mr. Altham could not, perhaps owing to
      his lack of imagination, see anybody else, not even his own
      wife, occupying Mrs. Ames' position. There was some force
      about her that put her where she was. You felt her
      efficiency; you guessed that should situations arise Mrs.
      Ames could deal with them. She had a larger measure of
      reality than the majority of Mr. Altham's acquaintances.
      She did not seem to exert herself in any way, or call
      attention to what she did, and yet when Mrs. Ames called on
      some slightly doubtful newcomer to Riseborough, it was
      certain that everybody else would call too. And one defect
      she had of the most glaring nature. She appeared to take
      the most tepid interest only in what every one said about
      everybody else. Once, not so long ago, Mrs. Altham had
      shown herself more than ready to question, on the best
      authority, the birth and upbringing of Mrs. Turner, the
      election of whose husband to the club had caused so many
      members to threaten resignation. But all Mrs. Ames had
      said, when it was clear that the shadiest antecedents were
      filed, so to speak, for her perusal, was, "I have always
      found her a very pleasant woman. She is dining with us on
      Tuesday." Or again, when he himself was full of the praise
      of Mrs. Taverer, to whom Mrs. Ames was somewhat coldly
      disposed--(though that lady had called three times, and was
      perhaps calling again this afternoon, Mrs. Ames had never
      once asked her to lunch or dine, and was believed to have
      left cards without even inquiring whether she was in)--Mrs.
      Ames had only answered his panegyrics by saying, "I am told
      she is a very good-natured sort of woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham, hearing the stopping of a cab at his
      front-door, got up. It was still thirteen minutes to three,
      but he was ready to start. Indeed, he felt that motion and
      distraction would be very welcome, for there had stolen
      into his brain a strangely upsetting idea. It was very
      likely quite baseless and ill-founded, but it did occur to
      him that this defect on the part of Mrs. Ames as regards
      her incuriousness on the subject of the small affairs of
      other people was somehow connected with her ascendency. He
      had so often thought of it as a defect that it was quite a
      shock to find himself wondering whether it was a quality.
      In any case, it was a quality which he was glad to be
      without. The possession of it would have robbed him of
      quite nine points of the laws that governed his nature. He
      would have been obliged to cultivate a passion for
      gardening, like Major Ames. Of course, if you married a
      woman quite ten years your senior, you had to take to
      something, and it was lucky Major Ames had not taken to
      drink.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He felt quite cynical, and lost the first four holes.
      Later, but too late, he pulled himself together. But it was
      poor consolation to win the bye only.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames put up her black and white sunshade as she
      stepped into the hot street outside Dr. Evans' house, about
      half-past six on the evening of the twenty-eighth of June,
      and proceeded afoot past the half-dozen houses that lay
      between it and the High Street. In appearance she was like
      a small, good-looking toad in half-mourning; or, to state
      the comparison with greater precision, she was small for a
      woman, but good-looking for a toad. Her face had something
      of the sulky and satiated expression of that harmless
      reptile, and her mourning was for her brother, who had
      mercifully died of delirium tremens some six months before.
      This scarcely respectable mode of decease did not curtail
      his sister's observance of the fact, and she was proposing
      to wear mourning for another three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not seen him much of late years, and, as a matter
      of fact, she thought it was much better that his inglorious
      career, since he was a hopeless drunkard, had been brought
      to a conclusion, but her mourning, in spite of this, was a
      faithful symbol of her regret. He had had the good looks
      and the frailty of her family, while she was possessed of
      its complementary plainness and strength, but she
      remembered with remarkable poignancy, even in her
      fifty-fifth year, birds'-nesting expeditions with him, and
      the alluring of fish in unpopulous waters. They had shared
      their pocket-money together, also, as children, and she had
      not been the gainer by it. Therefore she thought of him
      with peculiar tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be idle to deny that she was not interested in the
      Riseborough view of his blackness. It was quite well known
      that he was a drunkard, but she had stifled inquiry by
      stating that he had died of "failure." What organ it was
      that failed could not be inquired into: any one with the
      slightest proper feeling--and she was well aware that
      Riseborough had almost an apoplexy of proper feeling--would
      assume that it was some organ not generally mentioned. She
      felt that there was no call on her to gratify any curiosity
      that might happen to be rampant. She also felt that the
      chief joy in the possession of a sense of humour lies in
      the fact that others do not suspect it. Riseborough would
      certainly have thought it very heartless of her to derive
      any amusement from things however remotely connected with
      her brother's death; Riseborough also would have been
      incapable of crediting her with any tenderness of memory,
      if it had known that he had actually died of delirium
      tremens.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this stifling weather she almost envied those who, like
      Dr. Evans, lived at the top of the town, where, in Castle
      Street, was situated the charming Georgian house in the
      garden of which he for a little while only, and his wife
      for three hours, had been entertaining their friends and
      detractors at the garden-party. Though the house was in a
      "Street," and not a "Road," it had a garden which anybody
      would expect to belong to a "Road," if not a "Place."
      Streets seemed to imply small backyards looking into the
      backs of other houses, whereas Dr. Evans' house did not, at
      its back, look on other houses at all, but extended a full
      hundred yards, and then looked over the railway cutting of
      the South-Eastern line, on open fields. Should you feel
      unkindly disposed, it was easy to ask whether the noise of
      passing trains was not very disagreeable, and indeed, Mrs.
      Taverner, in a moment of peevishness arising from the fact
      that what she thought was champagne cup was only hock cup,
      had asked that very question of Millicent Evans this
      afternoon in Mrs. Ames' hearing. But Millicent, in her most
      confiding and child-like manner, had given what Mrs. Ames
      considered to be a wholly admirable and suitable answer.
      "Indeed we do," she had said, "and we often envy you your
      beautiful big lawn." For everybody, of course, knew that
      Mrs. Taverner's beautiful big lawn was a small piece of
      black earth diversified by plantains, and overlooked and
      made odorous by the new gasworks. Mrs. Taverner had, as was
      not unnatural, coloured up on receipt of this silken
      speech, until she looked nearly as red as Mrs. Altham. For
      herself, Mrs. Ames would not, even under this provocation,
      have made so ill-natured a reply, though she was rather
      glad that Millicent had done so, and to account for her
      involuntary smile, she instantly asked Mrs. Altham to lunch
      with her next day. Indeed, walking now down the High
      Street, she smiled again at the thought, and Mr. Pritchard,
      standing outside his grocery store, thought she smiled at
      him, and raised his hat. And Mrs. Ames rather hoped he saw
      how different a sort of smile she kept on tap, so to speak,
      for grocers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames knew very well the manner of speeches that Mrs.
      Altham had been indulging in during the last three weeks,
      about the little dinner-party she was giving this evening,
      for she had been indiscreet enough to give specimens of
      them to Millicent Evans, who had promptly repeated them to
      her, and it is impossible adequately to convey how
      unimportant she thought was anything that Mrs. Altham said.
      But the fact that she had said so much was indirectly
      connected with her asking Mrs. Altham ("and your husband,
      of course," as she had rather pointedly added) to lunch
      to-morrow, for she knew that Mrs Altham would be bursting
      with curiosity about the success of the new experiment, and
      she intended to let her burst. She disliked Mrs. Altham,
      but that lady's hostility to herself only amused her. Of
      course, Mrs. Altham could not refuse to accept her
      invitation, because it was a point of honour in Riseborough
      that any one bidden to lunch the day after a dinner-party
      must, even at moderate inconvenience, accept, for otherwise
      what was to happen to the remains of salmon and of jelly
      too debilitated to be served in its original shape, even
      though untouched, but still excellent if eaten out of
      jelly-glasses? So much malice, then, must be attributed to
      Mrs. Ames, that she wished to observe the febrile symptoms
      of Mrs. Altham's curiosity, and not to calm them, but
      rather excite them further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames would not naturally have gone for social purposes
      to the house of her doctor, had he not married Millicent,
      whose father was her own first cousin, and would have been
      baronet himself had he been the eldest instead of the
      youngest child. As it was, Dr. Evans was on a wholly
      different footing from that of an ordinary physician, for
      by marriage he, as she by birth, was connected with
      "County," which naturally was the crown and cream of
      Riseborough society. Mrs. Ames was well aware that the
      profession of a doctor was a noble and self-sacrificing
      one, but lines had to be drawn somewhere, and it was
      impossible to contemplate visiting Dr. Holmes. A dentist's
      profession was self-sacrificing, too, but you did not dine
      at your dentist's, though his manipulations enabled you to
      dine with comfort and confident smiles elsewhere. Such
      lines as these she drew with precision, but automatic
      firmness, and the apparently strange case of Mr. Turner,
      whom she had induced her husband to propose for election at
      the club, whom, with his wife, she herself asked to dinner,
      was really no exception. For it was not Mr. Turner who had
      ever been a stationer in Riseborough, but his father, and
      he himself had been to a public school and a university,
      and had since then purged all taint of stationery away by
      twenty years' impartiality as a police magistrate in
      London. True, he had not changed his name when he came back
      to live in Riseborough, which would have shown a greater
      delicacy of mind, and the present inscription above the
      stationer's shop, "Burrows, late Turner," was obnoxious,
      but Mrs. Ames was all against the misfortunes of the
      fathers being visited on the children, and Riseborough,
      with the exception of Mrs. Altham, had quite accepted Mr.
      and Mrs. Turner, who gave remarkably good dinners, which
      were quite equal to the finest efforts of the (Scotch) chef
      at the club. Mrs. Altham said that the Turners had eaten
      their way into the heart of Riseborough society, which
      sounded almost witty, until Mrs. Ames pointed out that it
      was Riseborough, not the Turners, who had done the eating.
      On which the wit in Mrs. Altham's <i>mot</i> went out like
      a candle in the wind. It may, perhaps, be open to question
      whether Mrs. Altham's rooted hostility to the Turners did
      not predispose Mrs. Ames to accept them before their quiet
      amiability disposed her to do so, for she was neither
      disposed nor predisposed to like Mrs. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames' way led through Queensgate Street, and she had
      to hold her black skirt rather high as she crossed the road
      opposite the club, for the dust was thick. She felt it
      wiser also to screw her small face up into a tight knot in
      order to avoid inhaling the fetid blue smoke from an
      over-lubricated motorcar that very rudely dashed by just in
      front of her. She did not regard motors with any favour,
      since there were financial reasons, whose validity was
      unassailable, why she could not keep one; indeed, partly no
      doubt owing to her expressed disapproval of them, but
      chiefly owing to similar financial impediments, Riseborough
      generally considered that hired flies were a more
      gentlemanly and certainly more leisurely form of vehicular
      transport. Mrs. Altham, as usual, raised a dissentient
      voice, and said that she and her husband could not make up
      their minds between a Daimler and a Rolles-Royce. This
      showed a very reasonable hesitancy, since at present they
      had no data whatever with regard to either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames permitted herself one momentary glance at the
      bow-window of the club, as she regained the pavement after
      this dusty passage, and then swiftly looked straight in
      front of her again, since it was not quite <i>quite</i> to
      look in at the window of a man's club. But she had seen
      several things: her husband was standing there with face
      contorted by the imminent approach of a sneeze, which
      showed that his hay-fever was not yet over, as he hoped it
      might be. There was General Fortescue with a large cigar in
      his mouth, and a glass, probably of sherry, in his hand;
      there was also the top of a bald head peering over the
      geraniums in the window like a pink full moon. That no
      doubt was Mr. Turner (for no one was quite so bald as he),
      enjoying the privilege which she had been instrumental in
      securing for him. Then Mrs. Altham passed her driving, and
      Mrs. Ames waved and kissed her black-gloved hand to her,
      thinking how very angular curiosity made people, while Mrs.
      Altham waved back thinking that it was no use trying to
      look important if you were only five foot two, so that
      honours were about divided. Finally, just before she turned
      into her own gate, she saw coming along the road, walking
      very fast, as his custom was, the man she respected and
      even revered more than any one in Riseborough. She would
      have liked to wave her hand to him too, only the Reverend
      Thomas Pettit would certainly have thought such a
      proceeding to be very odd conduct. He was county too--very
      much county, although a clergyman--being the son of that
      wealthy and distressing peer, Lord Evesham, who
      occasionally came into Riseborough on county business. On
      these occasions he lunched at the club, instead of going to
      his son's house, but did not eat the club lunch, preferring
      to devour in the smoking-room, like an ogre with false
      teeth, sandwiches which seemed to be made of fish in their
      decline. Mrs. Ames, who could not be called a religious
      woman, but was certainly very high church, was the most
      notable of Mr. Pettit's admirers, and, indeed, had set
      quite a fashion in going to the services at St. Barnabas',
      which were copiously embellished by banners, vestments and
      incense. Indeed, she went there in adoration of him as much
      as for any other reason, for he seemed to her to be a
      perfect apostle. He was rich, and gave far more than half
      his goods to feed the poor; he was eloquent, and (she would
      not have used so common a phrase) let them all "have it"
      from his pulpit, and she was sure he was rapidly wearing
      himself out with work. And how thrilling it would be to
      address her rather frequent notes to him with the title
      'The Reverend The Lord Evesham!' . . . She gave a heavy
      sigh, and decided to flutter her podgy hand in his
      direction for a greeting as she turned into her gate.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The little dinner which had so agitated Riseborough for the
      last three weeks gave Mrs. Ames no qualms at all. Whatever
      happened at her house was right, and she never had any
      reason to wonder, like minor dinner-givers, if things would
      go off well, since she and no other was responsible for the
      feast; it was Mrs. Ames' dinner party. It was summoned for
      a quarter to eight, and at half-past ten somebody's
      carriage would be announced, and she would say, "I hope
      nobody is thinking of going away yet," in consequence of
      which everybody would go away at twenty minutes to eleven
      instead. If anybody expected to play cards or smoke in the
      drawing-room, he would be disappointed, because these
      diversions did not form part of the curriculum. The
      gentlemen had one cigarette in the dining-room after their
      wine and with their coffee: then they followed the ladies
      and indulged in the pleasures of conversation. Mrs. Ames
      always sat in a chair by the window, and always as the
      clock struck ten she re-sorted her conversationalists. That
      was (without disrespect) a parlour-trick of the most
      supreme and unfathomable kind. There was always some
      natural reason why she should get up, and quite as
      naturally two or three people got up too. Then a sort of
      involuntary general post took place. Mrs. Ames annexed the
      seat of the risen woman whose partner she intended to talk
      to, and instantly said, "Do tell me, because I am so much
      interested . . ." upon which her new partner sat down
      again. The ejected female then wandered disconsolately
      forward till she found herself talking to some man who had
      also got up. Therefore they sat down again together. But no
      one in Riseborough could do the trick as Mrs. Ames could do
      it. Mrs. Altham had often tried, and her efforts always
      ended in everybody sitting down again exactly where they
      had been before, after standing for a moment, as if an
      inaudible grace was being said. But Mrs. Ames, though not
      socially jealous (for, being the queen of Riseborough
      society, she had nobody to be jealous of), was a little
      prone to spoil this parlour-trick when she was dining at
      other houses, by suddenly developing an earnest
      conversation with her already existing partner, when she
      saw that her hostess contemplated a copy of her famous
      man&oelig;uvre. Yet, after all, she was within her rights,
      for the parlour-trick was her own patent, and it was quite
      proper to thwart the attempted infringement of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having waggled her hand in the direction of Mr. Pettit, she
      went straight to the dining-room, where the dinner-table
      was being laid. There was to be a company of eight
      to-night, and accordingly she took three little cardboard
      slips from the top left-hand drawer of her writing-table,
      on each of which was printed--
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      PLEASE TAKE IN
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      TO DINNER.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      These were presented in the hall to the men before dinner
      (it was unnecessary to write one for her husband), each
      folded, with the name of the guest in question being
      written on the back, while the name of the woman he was to
      take in filled the second line. Thus there were no separate
      and hurried communications to be made in the drawing-room,
      as everything was arranged already. This was not so
      original as the other parlour-trick, but at present nobody
      else in Riseborough had attempted it. Then out of the same
      drawer she took--what she took requires a fresh paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Printed Menu-cards. There were a dozen packets of them,
      each packet advertising a different dinner: an astounding
      device, requiring enlargement of explanation. She
      discovered them by chance in the Military Stores in London,
      selected a dozen packets containing fifty copies each, and
      kept the secret to herself. The parlour-maids had orders to
      tweak them away as soon as the last course was served, so
      that no menu-collector, if there was such retrospective
      glutton in Riseborough, could appropriate them, and thus,
      perhaps, ultimately get a clue which might lead him to the
      solution. For by a portent of ill-luck, it might then
      conceivably happen that a certain guest would find himself
      bidden for the third or fourth time to eat precisely the
      same dinner as his odious collection told him that he had
      eaten six months before. But the tweaking parlour-maids
      obviated that risk, and if the menu-cards were still
      absolutely "unsoiled," Mrs. Ames used them again. There was
      one very sumptuous dinner among the twelve, there were nine
      dinners good enough for anybody, there were two dinners
      that might be described as "poor." It was one of these,
      probably, which Mrs. Altham had in her mind when she was so
      ruthless in respect to Mrs. Ames' food. But, poor or
      sumptuous, it appeared to the innocent Riseborough world
      that Mrs. Ames had her menu-cards printed as required;
      that, having constructed her dinner, she sent round a copy
      of it to the printer's to be set up in type. Probably she
      corrected the proofs also. She never called attention to
      these menus, and seemed to take them as a matter of course.
      Mrs. Altham had once directly questioned her about them,
      asking if they were not a great expense. But Mrs. Ames had
      only shifted a bracelet on her wrist and said, "I am
      accustomed to use them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames took four copies of one of these dinners which
      were good enough for anybody, and propped them up, two on
      each of the long sides of the table. Naturally, she did not
      want one herself, and her husband, also naturally,
      sometimes said, "What are you going to give us to-night,
      Amy?" In which case one of them was passed to him. But he
      had a good retentive memory with regard to food, and with a
      little effort he could remember what the rest of the dinner
      was going to be, when the nature of the soup had given him
      his cue. Occasionally he criticized, saying in his hearty
      voice (this would be in the autumn or winter), "What, what?
      Partridge again? <i>Perdrix repetita,</i> isn't it,
      General, if you haven't forgotten your Latin." And Amy from
      the other end of the table replied, "Well, Lyndhurst, we
      must eat the game our friends are so kind as to send us."
      And yet Mrs. Altham declared that she had seen partridges
      from the poulterers delivered at Mrs. Ames' house! "But
      they are getting cheap now," she added to her husband,
      "particularly the old birds. I got a leg, Henry, and the
      bird must have roosted on it for years before Mrs. Ames'
      friends were so kind as to send it her."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Ames propped up the printed menu-cards, and spoke a
      humorous word to her first parlour-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have often told you, Parker, to wear gloves when you are
      putting out the silver. I am not a detective: I am not
      wanting to trace you by your finger-prints."
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker giggled discreetly. Somehow, Mrs. Ames' servants
      adored their rather exacting mistress, and stopped with her
      for years. They did not get very high wages, and a great
      deal was required of them, but Mrs. Ames treated them like
      human beings and not like machines. It may have been only
      because they were so far removed from her socially; but it
      may have been that there was some essential and innate
      kindliness in her that shut up like a parasol when she had
      to deal with such foolish and trying folk as Mrs. Altham.
      Mrs. Altham, indeed, had tried to entice Parker away with a
      substantial rise in wages, and the prospect of less arduous
      service. But that admirable serving-maid had declined to be
      tempted. Also, she had reported the occurrence to her
      mistress. It only confirmed what Mrs. Ames already thought
      of the temptress. She did not add any further black mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table at present was devoid of any floral decoration,
      but that was no part of Mrs. Ames' province. Her husband,
      that premature gardener, was responsible for flowers and
      wine when Mrs. Ames gave a party, and always returned home
      half-an-hour earlier, to pick such of his treasures as
      looked as if they would begin to go off to-morrow, and make
      a subterranean excursion with a taper and the wine book to
      his cellar. In the domestic economy of the house he paid
      the rent, the rates and taxes, the upkeep of the garden,
      the wine bills, and the cost of their annual summer
      holiday, while Mrs. Ames' budget was responsible for coal,
      electric light, servants' wages, and catering bills.
      Arising out of this arrangement there occasionally arose
      clouds (though no bigger than Mrs. Ames' own hand) that
      flecked the brightness of their domestic serenity.
      Occasionally--not often--Mrs. Ames would be pungent about
      the possibility of putting out the electric light on
      leaving a room, occasionally her husband had sent for his
      coat at lunch-time, to supplement the heat given out on a
      too parsimonious hearth. But such clouds were never seen by
      other eyes than theirs: the presence of guests led Major
      Ames to speak of the excellence of his wife's cook and say,
      "'Pon my word, I never taste better cooking than what I get
      at home," and suggested to his wife to say to Mrs.
      Fortescue, "My husband so much enjoys having the General to
      dinner, for he knows a glass of good wine." She might with
      truth have said that he knew a good many glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the two shared in equal proportions the upkeep of
      a rather weird youth who was the only offspring of their
      marriage, and was mistakenly called Harry, for the name was
      singularly ill-suited to him. He had lank hair, protuberant
      eyes, and a tendency to write poetry. Just now he was at
      home from Cambridge, and had rather agitated his mother
      that afternoon by approaching her dreamily at the
      garden-party and saying, "Mother, Mrs. Evans is the most
      wonderful creature I ever saw!" That seemed to her so wild
      an exaggeration as to be quite senseless, and to portend
      poetry. Harry made his father uncomfortable, too, by
      walking about with some quite common rose in his hand, and
      pretending that the scent of it was meat and drink to him.
      Also he had queer notions about vegetarianism, and said
      that a hunch of brown bread, a plate of beans, and a lump
      of cheese, contained more nourishment than quantities of
      mutton chops. But though not much of a hand at victuals, he
      found inspiration in what he called "yellow wine," and he
      and a few similarly minded friends belonged to a secret
      Omar Khayyam Club at Cambridge, the proceedings of which
      were carried on behind locked doors, not for fear of the
      Jews, but of the Philistines. A large glass salad-bowl
      filled with yellow wine and sprinkled with rose-leaves was
      the inspirer of these mild orgies, and each Omarite had to
      write and read a short poem during the course of the
      evening. It was a point of honour among members always to
      be madly in love with some usually unconscious lady, and
      paroxysms of passion were punctuated by Byronic cynicism.
      Just now it seemed likely that Mrs. Evans would soon be the
      fount of aspiration and despair. That would create quite a
      sensation at the next meeting of the Omar Club: nobody
      before had been quite so daring as to fall in love with a
      married woman. But no doubt that phenomenon has occurred in
      the history of human passion, so why should it not occur to
      an Omarite?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The wine at Mrs. Ames' parties was arranged by her husband
      on a scale that corresponded with the food. At either of
      the two "poor" dinners, for instance, a glass of Marsala
      was accorded with the soup, a light (though wholesome)
      claret moistened the rest of the meal, and a single glass
      of port was offered at dessert. The course of the nine
      dinners good enough for anybody was enlivened by the
      substitution of sherry for Marsala, champagne for claret,
      and liqueurs presented with coffee, while on the much rarer
      occasions of the one sumptuous dinner (which always
      included an ice) liqueur made its first appearance with the
      ice, and a glass of hock partnered the fish. To-night,
      therefore, sherry was on offer, and when, the dinner being
      fairly launched, Mrs. Ames took her first disengaged look
      round, she observed with some little annoyance,
      justifiable, even laudable, in a hostess, that Harry was
      talking in the wrong direction. In fact, he was devoting
      his attention to Mrs. Evans, who sat between him and his
      father, instead of entertaining Elsie, her daughter, whom
      he had taken in, and who now sat isolated and silent, since
      General Fortescue, who was on her other side, was naturally
      conversing with his hostess. Certainly it was rubbish to
      call Mrs. Evans a most wonderful creature; there was
      nothing wonderful about her. She was fair, with pretty
      yellow hair (an enthusiast might have called it golden),
      she had small regular features, and that look of
      distinction which Mrs. Ames (drawing herself up a little as
      she thought of it) considered to be inseparable from any in
      whose veins ran the renowned Westbourne blood. She had also
      that slim, tall figure which, though characteristic of the
      same race, was unfortunately not quite inseparable from its
      members, for no amount of drawing herself up would have
      conferred it on Mrs. Ames, and Harry took after her in this
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Evans had not long been settled in Riseborough--indeed,
      it was only last winter that he had bought his practice
      here, and taken the delightful house in which his wife had
      given so populous a garden-party that afternoon. Their
      coming, as advertised by Mrs. Ames, had been looked forward
      to with a high degree of expectancy, since a fresh tenant
      for the Red House, especially when he was known to be a man
      of wealth (though only a doctor), was naturally supposed to
      connote a new and exclusive entertainer, while his wife's
      relationship to Sir James Westbourne made a fresh link
      between the "town" and the "county." Hitherto, Mrs. Ames
      had been the chief link, and though without doubt she was a
      genuine one (her mother being a Westbourne), she had been a
      little disappointing in this regard, as she barely knew the
      present head of the family, and was apt to talk about old
      days rather than glorify the present ones by exhibitions of
      the family to which she belonged. But it was hoped that
      with the advent of Mrs. Evans a more living intimacy would
      be established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans was the fortunate possessor of that type of
      looks which wears well, and it was difficult to believe
      that Elsie, with her eighteen years and elderly manner, was
      her daughter. She was possessed also of that unemotional
      temperament which causes the years to leave only the
      faintest traces of their passage, and they had graven on
      her face but little record of joys and sorrows. Her mouth
      still possessed the softness of a girl's, and her eyes,
      large and blue, had something of the shy, unconscious
      wonder of childhood in their azure. To judge by appearances
      (which we shall all continue to do until the end of time,
      though we have made proverbs to warn us against the
      fallibility of such conclusions), she must have had the
      tender and innocent nature of a child, and though Mrs. Ames
      saw nothing wonderful about her, it was really remarkable
      that a woman could look so much and mean so little. She did
      not talk herself with either depth or volume, but she had,
      so to speak, a deep and voluminous way of listening which
      was immensely attractive. She made the man who was talking
      to her feel himself to be interesting (a thing always
      pleasant to the vainer sex), and in consequence he
      generally became interested. To fire the word "flirt" at
      her, point-blank, would have been a brutality that would
      have astounded her--nor, indeed, was she accustomed to use
      the somewhat obvious arts which we associate with those
      practitioners, but it is true that without effort she often
      established relations of intimacy with other people without
      any giving of herself in return. Both men and women were
      accustomed to take her into their confidence; it was so
      easy to tell her of private affairs, and her eyes, so wide
      and eager and sympathetic, gave an extraordinary tenderness
      to her commonplace replies, which accurately, by
      themselves, reflected her dull and unemotional mind. She
      possessed, in fact, as unemotional but comely people do,
      the potentiality of making a great deal of mischief without
      exactly meaning it, and it would be safe to predict that,
      the mischief being made, she would quite certainly acquit
      herself of any intention of having made it. It would be
      rash, of course, to assert that no breeze would ever stir
      the pearly sleeping sea of her temperament: all that can be
      said is that it had not been stirred yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames could not permit Elsie's isolation to continue,
      and she said firmly to Harry, "Tell Miss Evans all about
      Cambridge," which straightened conversation out again, and
      allowed Mrs. Evans to direct all her glances and little
      sentences to Major Ames. As was usual with men who had the
      privilege of talking to her, he soon felt himself a vivid
      conversationalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, gardening was always a hobby of mine," he was saying,
      "and in the regiment they used to call me Adam. The grand
      old gardener, you know, as Tennyson says. Not that there
      was ever anything grand about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans' mouth quivered into a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor old, either, Major Ames," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames put down the glass of champagne he had just
      sipped, in order to give his loud, hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," he said, "I'm pretty vigorous yet, and can
      pull the heavy garden roller as well as a couple of
      gardeners could. I never have a gardener more than a couple
      of days a week. I do all the work myself. Capital exercise,
      rolling the lawn, and then I take a rest with a bit of
      weeding, or picking a bunch of flowers for Amy's table.
      Weeding, too--
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'An hour's weeding a day<br>
        Keeps the doctor away.'
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I defy you to get lumbago if you do a bit of weeding every
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a little shy smile quivered on Millie Evans' mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall tell my husband," she said. "I shall say you told
      me you spend an hour a day in weeding, so that you
      shouldn't ever set eyes on him. And then you make poetry
      about it afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now, I call that downright wicked of you," he said,
      "twisting my words about in that way. General, I want your
      opinion about that glass of champagne. It's a '96 wine, and
      wants drinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      The General applied his fish-like mouth to his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wants drinking, does it?" he said. "Well, it'll get it
      from me. Delicious! Goo' dry wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames turned to Millie Evans again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg your pardon, Mrs. Evans," he said, "but General
      Fortescue likes to know what's before him. Yes, downright
      wicked of you! I'm sure I wish Amy had asked Dr. Evans
      to-night, but there--you know what Amy is. She's got a
      notion that it will make a pleasanter dinner-table not to
      ask husband and wife always together. She says it's done a
      great deal in London now. But they can't put on to their
      tables in London such sweet-peas as I grow here in my bit
      of a garden. Look at those in front of you. Black Michaels,
      they are. Look at the size of them. Did you ever see such
      sweet-peas? I wonder what Amy is going to give us for
      dinner to-night. Bit of lamb next, is it? and a quail to
      follow. Hope you'll go Nap, Mrs. Evans; I must say Amy has
      a famous cook. And what do you think of us all down at
      Riseborough, now you've had time to settle down and look
      about you? I daresay you and your husband say some sharp
      things about us, hey? Find us very stick-in-the-mud after
      London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him one of those shy little deprecating glances
      that made him involuntarily feel that he was a most
      agreeable companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you are being wicked now!" she said. "Every one is
      delightful. So kind, so hospitable. Now, Major Ames, do
      tell me more about your flowers. Black Michaels, you said
      those were. I must go in for gardening, and will you begin
      to teach me a little? Why is it that your flowers are so
      much more beautiful than anybody's? At least, I needn't
      ask: it must be because you understand them better than
      anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames felt that this was an uncommonly agreeable
      woman, and for half a second contrasted her pleasant
      eagerness to hear about his garden with his wife's complete
      indifference to it. She liked flowers on the table, but she
      scarcely knew a hollyhock from a geranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," he said; "I don't say that my flowers, which
      you are so polite as to praise, don't owe something to my
      care. Rain or fine, I don't suppose I spend less than an
      average of four hours a day among them, year in, year out.
      And that's better, isn't it, than sitting at the club,
      listening to all the gossip and tittle-tattle of the
      place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you are like me," she said. "I hate gossip. It is so
      dull. Gardening is so much more interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as I tell Amy," he said, "if our friends come here
      expecting to hear all the tittle-tattle of the place, they
      will be in for a disappointment. Amy and I like to give our
      friends a hearty welcome and a good dinner, and pleasant
      conversation about really interesting things. I know little
      about the gossip of the town; you would find me strangely
      ignorant if you wanted to talk about it. But politics
      now--one of those beastly Radical members of Parliament
      lunched with us only the week before last, and I assure you
      that Amy asked him some questions he found it hard to
      answer. In fact, he didn't answer them: he begged the
      question, begged the question. There was one, I remember,
      which just bowled him out. She said, 'What is to happen to
      the parks of the landed gentry, if you take them away from
      the owners?' Well, that bowled him out, as they say in
      cricket. Look at Sir James's place, for instance, your
      cousin's place, Amy's cousin's place. Will they plant a row
      of villas along the garden terrace? And who is to live in
      them if they do? Grant that Lloyd George--she said
      that--grant that Lloyd George wants a villa there, that
      will be one villa. But the terrace there will hold a dozen
      villas. Who will take the rest of them? She asked him that.
      They take away all our property, and then expect us to
      build houses on other people's! Don't talk to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The concluding sentence was not intended to put a stop on
      this pleasant conversation; it was only the natural
      ejaculation of one connected with landed proprietors. Mrs.
      Evans understood it in that sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do tell me all about it," she said. "Of course, I am only
      a woman, and we are supposed to have no brains, are we not?
      and to be able to understand nothing about politics. But
      will they really take my cousin James's place away from
      him? I think Radicals must be wicked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More fools than knaves, I always say," said Major Ames
      magnanimously. "They are deluded, like the poor
      Suffragettes. Suffragettes now! A woman's sphere of
      influence lies in her home. Women are the queens of the
      earth; I've often said that, and what do queens want with
      votes? Would Amy have any more influence in Riseborough if
      she had a vote? Not a bit of it. Well, then, why go about
      smacking the faces of policemen and chaining yourself to a
      railing? If I had my way--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames became of lower voice and greater confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amy doesn't wholly agree with me," he said; "and it's a
      pleasure to thrash the matter out with somebody like
      yourself, who has sensible views on the subject. What use
      are women in politics? None at all, as you just said. It's
      for women to rock the cradle, and rule the world. I say,
      and I have always said, that to give them a vote would be
      to wreck their influence, God bless them. But Amy doesn't
      agree with me. I say that I will vote--she's a
      Conservative, of course, and so am I--I will vote as she
      wishes me to. But she says it's the principle of the thing,
      not the practice. But what she calls principle, I call want
      of principle. Home: that's the woman's sphere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard it so beautifully expressed," she said.
      "Major Ames, why don't you go in for politics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames felt himself flattered; he felt also that he
      deserved the flattery. Hence, to him now, it ceased to be
      flattery, and became a tribute. He became more
      confidential, and vastly more vapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lady," he said, "politics is a dirty business
      now-a-days. We can serve our cause best by living a quiet
      and dignified life, without ostentation, as you see, but by
      being gentlemen. It is the silent protest against these
      socialistic ideas that will tell in the long run. What
      should I do at Westminster? Upon my soul, if I found myself
      sitting opposite those Radical louts, it would take me all
      my time to keep my temper. No, no; let me attend to my
      garden, and give my friends good dinners,--bless my soul,
      Amy is letting us have an ice to-night--strawberry ice, I
      expect; that was why she asked me whether there were plenty
      of strawberries. <i>Glace de fraises;</i> she likes her
      menu-cards printed in French, though I am sure 'strawberry
      ice' would tell us all we wanted to know. What's in a name
      after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation had already shifted, and Major Ames turned
      swiftly to a dry-skinned Mrs. Brooks who sat on his left.
      She was a sad high-church widow who embroidered a great
      deal. Her dress was outlined with her own embroideries, so,
      too, were many altar-cloths at the church of St. Barnabas.
      She and Mrs. Ames had a sort of religious rivalry over its
      decoration; the one arranged the copious white lilies that
      crowned the cloth made by the other. Their rivalry was not
      without silent jealousy, and it was already quite well
      known that Mrs. Brooks had said that lilies of the valley
      were quite as suitable as Madonna lilies, which shed a
      nasty yellow pollen on the altar-cloth. But Madonna lilies
      were larger; a decoration required fewer "blooms." In other
      moods also she was slightly acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans turned slowly to her right, where Harry was
      sitting. She might almost be supposed to know that she had
      a lovely neck, at least it was hard to think that she had
      lived with it for thirty-seven years in complete
      unconsciousness of it. If she moved her head very quickly,
      there was just a suspicion of loose skin about it. But she
      did not move her head very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now let us go on talking," she said. "Have you told my
      little girl all about Cambridge? Tell me all about
      Cambridge too. What fun you must have! A lot of young men
      together, with no stupid women and girls to bother them. Do
      you play a great deal of lawn-tennis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry reconsidered for a moment his verdict concerning the
      wonderfulness of her. It was hardly happy to talk to a
      member of the Omar Club about games and the advantages of
      having no girls about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I don't play games much," he said. "The set I am in
      don't care for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tilted her head a little back, as if asking pardon for
      her ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know," she said. "I thought perhaps you liked
      games--football, racquets, all that kind of thing. I am
      sure you could play them beautifully if you chose. Or
      perhaps you like gardening? I had such a nice talk to your
      father about flowers. What a lot he knows about them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Flowers were better than games, anyhow; Harry put down his
      spoon without finishing his ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever noticed what a wonderful colour <i>La
      France</i> roses turn at twilight?" he asked. "All the
      shadows between the petals become blue, quite blue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they really? You must show me sometime. Are there some
      in your garden here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but father doesn't care about them so much because
      they are common. I think that is so strange of him. Sunsets
      are common, too, aren't they? There is a sunset every day.
      But the fact that a thing is common doesn't make it less
      beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what a nice idea," she said. "I am sure you thought of
      it. Do you talk about these things much at Cambridge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames began to collect ladies' eyes at this moment, and
      the conversation had to be suspended. Millie Evans, though
      she was rather taller than Harry, managed, as she passed
      him on the way to the door, to convey the impression of
      looking up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell me all about it," she said. "And show me
      those delicious roses turning blue at twilight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner had been at a quarter to eight, and when the men
      joined the women again in the drawing-room, light still
      lingered in the midsummer sky. Then Harry, greatly daring,
      since such a procedure was utterly contrary to all
      established precedents, persuaded Mrs. Evans to come out
      into the garden, and observe for herself the chameleonic
      properties of the roses. Then he had ventured on another
      violation of rule, since all rights of flower-picking were
      vested in his father, and had plucked her half-a-dozen of
      them. But on their return with the booty, and the
      establishment of the blue theory, his father, so far from
      resenting this invasion of his privileges, had merely
      said--
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rascal might have found you something choicer than
      that, Mrs. Evans. But we'll see what we can find you
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had again seemed to look up at Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can be lovelier than my beautiful roses," she
      said. "But it is sweet of you to think of sending me some
      more. Cousin Amy, look at the roses Mr. Harry has given
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriages arrived as usual that night at half-past ten, at
      which hour, too, a gaunt, grenadier-like maid of certain
      age, rapped loudly on the front door, and demanded Mrs.
      Brooks, whom she was to protect on her way home, and as
      usual carriages and the grenadier waited till twenty
      minutes to eleven. But even at a quarter to, no conveyance,
      by some mischance, had come for Mrs. Evans, and despite her
      protests, Major Ames insisted on escorting her and Elsie
      back to her house. Occasionally, when such mistakes
      occurred, it had been Harry's duty to see home the
      uncarriaged, but to-night, when it would have been his
      pleasure, the privilege was denied him. So, instead, after
      saying good-night to his mother, he went swiftly to his
      room, there to write a mysterious letter to a member of the
      Omar Club, and compose a short poem, which should, however
      unworthily, commemorate this amorous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing in the world more rightly sacred than the
      first dawnings of love in a young man, but, on the other
      hand, there is nothing more ludicrous if his emotions are
      inspired, or even tinged, by self-consciousness and the
      sense of how fine a young spark he is. And our unfortunate
      Harry was charged with this absurdity; all through the
      evening it had been present to his mind, how dashing and
      Byronic a tale this would prove at the next meeting of the
      Omar Khayyam Club; with what fine frenzy he would throw
      off, in his hour of inspiration after the yellow wine, the
      little heart-wail which he was now about to compose, as
      soon as his letter to Gerald Everett was written. And lest
      it should seem unwarrantable to intrude in the spirit of
      ridicule on a young man's rapture and despair, an extract
      from his letter should give solid justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I can't give names," he said, "because you know
      how such things get about; but, my God, Gerald, how
      wonderful she is. I saw her this afternoon for the first
      time, and she dined with us tonight. She understands
      everything--whatever I said, I saw reflected in her eyes,
      as the sky is reflected in still water. After dinner I took
      her out into the garden, and showed her how the shadows of
      the <i>La France</i> roses turn blue at dusk. I quoted to
      her these two lines--
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        'O, thou art fairer than the evening air,<br>
        Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars.'
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And I <i>think</i> she saw that I quoted <i>at</i> her. Of
      course, she turned it off, and said, 'What pretty lines!'
      but I think she saw. And she carried my roses home. Lucky
      roses!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gerald, I am miserable! I haven't told you yet. For she is
      married. She has a great stupid husband, years and years
      older than herself. She has, too, a great stupid daughter.
      There's another marvel for you! Honestly and soberly she
      does not look more than twenty-five. I will write again,
      and tell you how all goes. But I think she likes me; there
      is clearly something in common between us. There is no
      doubt she enjoyed our little walk in the dusk, when the
      roses turned blue. . . . Have you had any successes
      lately?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his letter, and before beginning his poem, lit
      the candle on his dressing-table, and examined his small,
      commonplace visage in the glass. It was difficult to
      arrange his hair satisfactorily. If he brushed it back it
      revealed an excess of high, vacant-looking forehead; if he
      let it drop over his forehead, though his resemblance to
      Keats was distinctly strengthened, its resemblance to
      seaweed was increased also. The absence of positive eyebrow
      was regrettable, but was there not fire in his rather pale
      and far-apart eyes? He rather thought there was. His nose
      certainly turned up a little, but what, if not that, did
      tip-tilted imply? A rather long upper-lip was at present
      only lightly fledged with an adolescent moustache, but
      there was decided strength in his chin. It stuck out. And
      having practised a frown which he rather fancied, he went
      back to the table in the window again, read a few stanzas
      of <i>Dolores,</i> in order to get into tune with passion
      and bitterness (for this poem was not going to begin or end
      happily) and wooed the lyric muse.
    </p>

      Major Ames, meantime, had seen Mrs. Evans to her door, and
      retraced his steps as far as the club, where he was in
      half-a-mind to go in, and get a game of billiards, which he
      enjoyed. He played in a loud, hectoring and unskilful
      manner, and it was noticeable that all the luck (unless, as
      occasionally happened, he won) was invariably on the side
      of his opponent. But after an irresolute pause, he went on
      again, and let himself into his own house. Amy was still
      sitting in the drawing-room, though usually she went to bed
      as soon as her guests had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pleasant evening, my dear," he said; "and your plan
      was a great success. Uncommonly agreeable woman Mrs. Evans
      is. Pretty woman, too; you would never guess she was the
      mother of that great girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was not considered pretty as a girl," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? Then she must have improved in looks afterwards.
      Lonely life rather, to be a doctor's wife, with your
      husband liable to be called away at any hour of the day or
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt Millie occupies herself very well," said
      Mrs. Ames. "Good-night, Lyndhurst. Are you coming up to
      bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not just yet. I shall sit up a bit, and smoke another
      cigar."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the window, and every now and then found himself
      saying half aloud, "Uncommonly agreeable woman." Just
      overhead Harry was tearing passion to shreds in the style
      (more or less) of Swinburne.

      Dr. Evans was looking out of the window of his dining-room
      as he waited the next morning for breakfast to be brought
      in, jingling a pleasant mixture of money and keys in his
      trouser pockets and whistling a tune that sounded vague and
      De Bussy-like until you perceived that it was really an air
      familiar to streets and barrel-organs, and owed its elusive
      quality merely to the fact that the present performer was a
      little uncertain as to the comparative value of tones and
      semitones. But this slightly discouraging detail was more
      than compensated for by the evident cheerfulness of the
      executant; his plump, high-coloured face, his merry eye,
      the singular content of his whole aspect betokened a
      personality that was on excellent terms with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His surroundings were as well furnished and securely
      comfortable as himself. The table was invitingly laid; a
      Sheffield-plate urn (Dr. Evans was an amateur in Georgian
      decoration and furniture) hissed and steamed with little
      upliftings of the lid under the pressure within, and a
      number of hot dishes suggested an English interpretation of
      breakfast. Fine mezzotints after the great English
      portrait-painters hung on the walls, and a Chippendale
      sideboard was spread with fruit dishes and dessert-plates.
      The morning was very hot, but the high, spacious room, with
      its thick walls, was cool and fresh, while its
      potentialities for warmth and cosiness in the winter were
      sponsored for by the large open fire-place and the stack of
      hot-water pipes which stood beneath the sideboard. Outside,
      the windows at which Dr. Evans stood looked out on to the
      large and secluded lawn, which had been the scene of the
      garden-party the day before. Red-brick walls ran along the
      two sides of it at right angles to the house: opposite, a
      row of espaliered fruit-trees screened off the homeliness
      of the kitchen-garden beyond, and the railway cutting which
      formed the boundary of this pleasant place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Evans had whistled the first dozen bars of the
      "Merry Widow Waltz" some six or seven times through,
      before, with the retarded consciousness that it was Sunday,
      he went on to "The Church's One Foundation," and though,
      with his usual admirable appetite, he felt the allure of
      the hot dishes, he waited, still whistling, for some other
      member of his household, wife or daughter, to appear. He
      was one of the most gregarious and clubbable of men, and no
      hecatomb of stalled oxen would have given him content, if
      he had had to eat his beef alone. A firm attachment to his
      domestic circle, combined with the not very exacting calls
      of his practice, but truly fervent investigations in the
      laboratory at the end of the garden, of the habits and
      economy of phagocytes, comfortably filled up, to the
      furthest horizon, the scenery of his mental territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not to wait long for his wife to appear, and he
      hailed her with his wonted cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, little woman," he said. "Slept well, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans did not practise at home all those arts of
      pleasing with which she was so lavish in other people's
      houses. Also, this morning she felt rather cross, a thing
      which, to do her justice, was rare with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very," she said. "I kept waking. It was stiflingly
      hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, my dear," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans busied herself with tea-making; her long,
      slender hands moved with extraordinary deftness and silence
      among clattering things, and her husband whistled the
      "Merry Widow Waltz" once or twice more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Wilfred, do stop that odious tune," she said, without
      the slightest hint of impatience in her voice. "It is bad
      enough on your pianola, which, after all, is in tune!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is more than can be said for my penny whistle?"
      asked he, good-humouredly. "Right you are, I'm dumb. Tell
      me about your party last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, haven't you been to enough Riseborough parties to
      know that there is nothing to tell about any party?" she
      asked. "I sat between Major Ames and the son. I talked
      gardening on one side with the father, and something which
      I suppose was enlightened Cambridge conversation on the
      other. Harry Ames is rather a dreadful sort of youth. He
      took me into the garden afterwards to show me something
      about roses. And the carriage didn't come. Major Ames saw
      me home. When did you get in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till nearly three. Very difficult maternity case. But
      we'll pull them both through."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie Evans gave a little shudder, which was not quite
      entirely instinctive. She emphasized it for her husband's
      benefit. Unfortunately, he did not notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have your tea now?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with an air mainly conjugal but tinged
      with professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit upset with the heat, little woman?" he asked. "You
      look a trifle off colour. We can't have you sleeping badly,
      either. Show me the man who sleeps his seven hours every
      night, and I'll show you who will live to be ninety."
    </p>
    <p>
      This prospect did not for the moment allure his wife
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I would sooner sleep less and die earlier," she
      said in her even voice, "though I'm sure Elsie will live to
      a hundred at that rate. You encourage her to be lazy in the
      morning, Wilfred. I'm sure any one can manage to be in time
      for breakfast at a quarter past nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, little woman," he said. "Let a growing girl sleep
      just as much as she feels inclined. I would sooner stint a
      girl's food than her sleep. Give the red corpuscles a
      chance, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie got up from the table, and went to the sideboard to
      get some fruit. Then suddenly it struck her that all this
      was hardly worth while. It seemed a stupid business to come
      down every morning and eat breakfast, to manage the
      household, to go for a walk, perhaps, or sit in the garden,
      and after completing the round of these daily futilities,
      to go to bed again and sleep, just for the recuperation
      that sleep gave, to enable her to do it all over again. But
      the strawberries looked cool and moist, and standing by the
      sideboard she ate a few of them. Just above it hung the
      oblong Sheraton mirror, which her husband had bought so
      cheaply at a local sale and had brought home so
      triumphantly. That, too, seemed to tell her a stale story,
      and the reflection of her young face, crowned with the
      shimmer of yellow hair, against the dark oak background of
      the panelling seemed without purpose or significance. She
      was doing nothing with her beauty that stayed so long with
      her. But it would not stay many years longer: this morning
      even there seemed to be a shadow over it, making it dim. .
      . . Soon nobody would care if she had ever been pretty or
      not; indeed, even now Elsie seemed by her height and the
      maturity of her manner to be reminding everybody of the
      fact that she herself must be approaching the bar which
      every woman has to cross when she is forty or thereabouts.
      . . . And, strange enough it may appear, these doubts and
      questionings which looked at Millie darkly from the
      Sheraton glass above the sideboard, selfish and elementary
      as they were, resembled "thought" far more closely than did
      the generality of those surface impressions that as a rule
      mirrored her mind. They were, too, rather actively
      disagreeable, and generally speaking, nothing disagreeable
      occurred to her. The experiences of every day might be
      mildly exhilarating, or mildly tedious. But, whatever they
      were, she was not accustomed to think closely about them.
      Now, for the moment, it seemed to her that some shadow,
      some vague presence confronted her, and menacingly demanded
      her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riseborough is notable for the number of its churches, and
      before long the air was mellow with bells. As a rule,
      Millie Evans went to church on Sunday morning with the same
      regularity as she ate hot roast beef for lunch when it was
      over, but this morning she easily let herself be persuaded
      to refrain from any act of public worship. It seemed quite
      within the bounds of possibility that she might feel faint
      during the psalms and, on her husband's advice, she settled
      to stop at home, leaving him and Elsie, who was quite
      unaware what faintness felt like, to attend. But it was not
      the fear of faintness that prompted her absence: she
      wanted, almost for the first time in her life, to be alone
      and to think. Even on the occasion of her marriage, she had
      not found it necessary to employ herself with original
      thought: her mother had done the thinking for her, and had
      advised her, as she felt quite sure, sensibly and well. Nor
      had she needed to think when she was expecting her only
      child, for on that occasion she had been perfectly content
      to do exactly as her husband told her. But now, at the age
      of thirty-seven, the sight of her own face in the glass had
      suggested to her certain possibilities, certain
      limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ill-health had, on infrequent Sundays, prevented her
      attendance at church, and now, following merely the
      dictates of habit, she took out with her to a basket chair
      below the big mulberry-tree in the garden, a Bible and
      prayer-book, out of which she supposed that she would read
      the psalms and lessons for the day. But the Bible remained
      long untouched, and when she opened it eventually at
      random, she read but one verse. It was at the end of
      Ecclesiastes that the leaves parted, and she read, "When
      desire shall fail, because man goeth to his long home."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough, for it was that, here succinctly
      expressed, which had been troubling her this morning,
      though so vaguely, that until she saw her symptoms written
      down shortly and legibly, she had scarcely known what they
      were. But certainly this line and a half described them. No
      doubt it was all very elementary; by degrees one ceased to
      care, and then one died. But her case was rather different
      from that, for she felt that with her desire had not
      failed, simply because she never had had desire. She had
      waked and slept, she had eaten and walked, she had had a
      child; but all these things had been of about the same
      value. Once she had had a tooth out, without gas; that was
      a slightly more vivid experience. But it was very soon
      over: she had not really cared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though she had not cared for any of those things, she
      had not been bored with the repetition of them. It had
      seemed natural that one thing should follow another, that
      the days should become weeks, and the weeks should become
      months, insensibly. When the months added themselves into
      years, she took notice of that fact by having a birthday,
      and Wilfred, as he gave her some little present in a
      morocco case, told her that she looked as young as when
      they first met, which was very nearly true. She had a
      quantity of these morocco cases now: he never omitted the
      punctual presentation of each. And the mental vision of all
      these morocco cases, some round, some square, some oblong,
      and the thought of their contents--a little pearl brooch, a
      sapphire brooch, a pair of emerald ear-rings, a jewelled
      hat-pin--suddenly came upon her with their cumulative
      effect. A lot of time had gone by; it chiefly lived in her
      now through the memory of the morocco cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      By virtue of her unemotional temperament and serene bodily
      health she looked very young still, and certainly did not
      feel old. But as the bells for church ceased to jangle and
      clash in the hot still air, leaving only for the ear the
      hum of multitudinous bees in the long flower-bed, it dawned
      on her that whatever she felt, and however she looked, she
      would soon be on the other side of that barrier which for
      woman marks the end of their essential and characteristic
      life. There were a few years left her yet out of the years
      of which she made so little use, and with a spasm, the
      keenest perhaps she had ever known, even including the
      extraction of the tooth without gas, the horror of
      middle-age fell upon her, making her shiver. All her life
      she had felt nothing: soon she would be incapable of
      feeling, except in so far as regret, that pale echo of what
      might once have been emotion, can be considered an affair
      of the heart. To feel, she readily perceived, implied the
      existence of something or somebody to feel about. But she
      did not know where to look for her participant. Long ago
      her husband had become as much part of that dead level of
      life as had her breakfast or her dressing for dinner. Never
      had he stirred her from her placid passivity, she had never
      yearned for him, in the sense in which a thirsty man
      desires water. She had no love of nature: "the primrose by
      the river's brim" might have been a violet for anything
      that she cared; charity, in its technical sense, was
      distasteful to her, because the curious smell in the houses
      of the poor made her only long to get away. It was hard to
      know where to turn to find an outlet for that drowsily
      awakening recognition of life that to-day, so late and as
      yet so feebly, stirred within her. Yet, though it stirred
      but feebly, there was movement there: it wanted to be alive
      for a little, before it was indubitably dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts went back to the topic concerning which she
      had told her husband that there was nothing to be
      told--namely, the dinner-party at the Ames' last night.
      Certainly there was nothing remarkable about it: she had
      conducted herself as usual, with the usual result. She was
      accustomed to deal out her little smiles and deferential
      glances and flattering speeches to those who sat next her
      at dinner, because in herself a mild amiability prompted
      her to make herself pleasant, and because, with so little
      trouble to herself, she could make a man behave as
      agreeably as he was capable of behaving. She attracted men
      very easily, cursorily one might say, without attaching any
      importance to the interest she aroused, and without looking
      further than the dinner-table for the fruits of the
      attraction she exercised. But this morning, this tardy and
      drowsy recognition of life, beside which, so to speak, lay
      the shadow of middle-age, gave her pause. Was there some
      fruition and development of herself, before the withered
      and barren years came to her, to be found there? It would
      be quite beyond the mark to say that, sitting here, she
      definitely proposed to herself to try to make herself
      emotionally interested in somebody else, in case that might
      add a zest to life, but she considered the effect which she
      so easily produced in others, and wondered what it meant to
      feel like that. Certainly Major Ames had enjoyed escorting
      her home; certainly Harry had felt a touch of <i>gauche</i>
      romance when he showed her the effect of twilight on the
      complexion of some rose or other. He had given her a whole
      bunch of roses, with an attempt at a pretty speech. Yes,
      that was it--the shadows in them looked pale-blue, and he
      had said that they were just the colour of her eyes. But
      the roses were pretty: she hoped that somebody had put them
      in water.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was already more than a little interested in her
      reflections: there was something original and exciting to
      her in them, and it was annoying to have them broken in
      upon by the parlour-maid who came towards her from the
      house. Personally, she thought it absurd not to keep
      men-servants, but Wilfred always maintained that a couple
      of good parlour-maids produced greater comfort with less
      disturbance, and yielding to him, as she always yielded to
      anybody who expressed a definite opinion, she had
      acquiesced in female service. But she always called the
      head parlour-maid Watkins, whereas her husband called her
      Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Major Ames wants to know if you will see him, ma'am," said
      Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ask him to come out," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watkins went back to the house and returned with Major Ames
      in tow, who carried a huge bouquet of sweet-peas. There
      then followed the difficulty of meeting and greeting
      gracefully and naturally which is usual when the visitor is
      visible a long way off. The Major put on a smile far too
      soon, and had to take it off again, since Mrs. Evans had
      not yet decided that it was time to see him. Then she began
      to smile, while he (without his smile) was looking
      abstractedly at the top of the mulberry-tree, as if he
      expected to find her there. He looked there a moment too
      long, for one of the lower branches suddenly knocked his
      straw hat off his head, and he said, "God bless my soul,"
      and dropped the sweet-peas. However, this was not an
      unmixed misfortune, for the recognition came quite
      naturally after that. She hoped he was not hurt, was he
      <i>sure</i> that silly branch had not hit his face? It must
      be taken off! <i>What</i> lovely flowers! And were they for
      her? They were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames replaced his hat rather hastily, after a swift
      man&oelig;uvre with regard to his hair which Mrs. Evans did
      not accurately follow. The fact was (though he believed the
      fact not to be generally known) that the top of Major Ames'
      head was entirely destitute of hair, and that the smooth
      crop which covered it was the produce of the side of his
      head--just above the ear--grown long, and brushed across
      the cranium so as to adorn it with seemingly local wealth
      and sleekness. The rough and unexpected removal of his hat
      by the bough of the mulberry-tree had caused a considerable
      portion of it to fall back nearly to the shoulder of the
      side on which it actually grew, and his hasty
      man&oelig;uvre with his gathered tresses was designed to
      replace them. Necessarily he put back his hat again
      quickly, in the manner of a boy capturing a butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind, and the condition of it, on this Sunday morning,
      would repay a brief analysis. Briefly, then, a sort of
      <i>aurora borealis</i> of youth had visited him: his heaven
      was streaked with inexplicable lights. He had told himself
      that a man of forty-seven was young still, and that when a
      most attractive woman had manifested an obvious interest in
      him, it was only reasonable to follow it up. He was not a
      coxcomb, he was not a loose liver; he was only a very
      ordinary man, well and healthy, married to a woman
      considerably older than himself, and living in a town
      which, in spite of his adored garden, presented but
      moderate excitements. But indeed, this morning call, paid
      with this solid tribute of sweet-peas, was something of an
      adventure, and had not been mentioned by him to his wife.
      He had seen her start for St. Barnabas, and then had
      hastily gathered his bouquet and set out, leaving Harry
      wandering dreamily about the cinder-paths in the kitchen
      garden, in the full glory of the discovery that the colour
      of the scarlet runners was like a clarion. Major Ames had
      plucked almost his rarest varieties, for to pluck the
      rarest, since he wished to save their first bloom for seed,
      would have been on the further side of quixotism and have
      verged on imbecility, but he had brought the best of his
      second-best. Last night, too, he had hinted at his own
      remissness in the matter of church attendance on
      Sunday-morning, and on his way up here had permitted
      himself to wonder whether Millie would prove (in
      consequence, perhaps, of that) to have abstained from
      worship also, expecting, or at least considering possible,
      a morning call from him. As a matter of fact she had not
      indulged in any such hopes, since it had been a matter of
      pure indifference to her whether he went to church on
      Sunday or not. But when he found on inquiry at the door
      that she was at home, it was scarcely unreasonable, on the
      part of a rather vain and gallantly minded man, to connect
      the fact with the information he had given.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he hastily readjusted his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own stupidity entirely," he said; "do not blame the
      tree. Yes, I have brought you just a few flowers, and
      though they are not worthy of your acceptance, they are not
      the worst bunch of sweet-peas I have ever seen, not the
      worst. These, Catherine the Great, for instance, are
      not--well--they do not grow quite in every garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans opened her blue eyes a little wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are they really for me, Major Ames?" she asked again.
      "It is good of you. My precious flowers! They must be put
      in water at once. Watkins, bring me one of the big
      flower-bowls out here. I will arrange them myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucky flowers, lucky flowers," chuckled Major Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's I who am lucky," said she, acknowledging this subtle
      compliment with a little smile. "I stop away from church
      rather lazily, and am rewarded by a pleasant visit and a
      beautiful nosegay. And what a charming party we had last
      night! I could hardly believe it when I came back here and
      found it was nearly half-past eleven. Such hours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames gave his great loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making fun of us, Mrs. Evans," he said; "'pon my
      word you are making fun of us and our quiet ways down at
      Riseborough. I'll be bound that when you were in London,
      half-past eleven was more the sort of time when you began
      to go out to your dances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I used to go out a good deal when I was quite young," she
      said. "Wilfred used quite to urge me to go out, and
      certainly people were very kind in asking me. I remember
      one night in the season, I was asked to two dinner-parties
      and a ball and an evening party. After all, it is natural
      to take pleasure in innocent gaiety when one is young."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames felt very hot after his walk, and, forgetting
      the adventure of his hair, nearly removed his straw hat.
      But providentially he remembered it again just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," Mrs. Evans, he said jovially, "you make me
      feel a hundred years old when you talk like that, as if
      your days of youth and success were over. Why, some one at
      your garden-party yesterday afternoon told me for a fact
      that Miss Elsie was the daughter of your husband's first
      wife. Wouldn't believe me when I said she was your
      daughter. Poor Sanders--it was Mr. Sanders who said it--had
      to pay ten shillings to me for his positiveness. He betted,
      you know, he insisted on betting. But really, any one who
      didn't happen to know would be right to make such a bet
      ninety-nine times out of a hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a little smile with lowered eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Elsie!" she said. "She is such a comfort to me. She
      quite manages the house for me, and spares me all the
      trouble. She always knows how much asparagus ought to cost,
      and what happens to strawberry ice after a party. I never
      was a good housekeeper. Wilfred always used to say to me,
      'Go out and enjoy yourself, my dear, and I'll pay the
      bills.' Of course, it was all his kindness, I know, but
      sometimes I wonder if it would not have been truer kindness
      to have made me think and contrive more. Elsie does it all
      now, but when my little girl marries it will be my turn
      again. Tell me, Major Ames, is it you or cousin Amy who
      makes everything go so beautifully at your house? I
      think--shall I say it--I think it must be you. When a man
      manages a house there is always more precision somehow: you
      feel sure that everything has been foreseen and provided
      for. Printed menu-cards, for instance--so <i>chic,</i> so
      perfectly <i>comme-il-faut."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Watkins had brought out a large dish, rather like a
      sponging-tin, for the sweet-peas, and Mrs. Evans had begun
      the really Herculean labour of putting them in water. A
      grille of wire network fitted over the rim of it: each pea
      was stuck in separately. She looked up from her task at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I right?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames was not really an untruthful man, but many men
      who are not really untruthful get through a wonderful lot
      of misrepresentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you mustn't give me the credit for that," he said
      (truthfully so far); "it's a dodge we always used to have
      at mess, so why not at one's own house also? It's better
      than written cards, which take a lot of time to copy out
      again and again, and then, you see, my dear Amy is not very
      strong at French, and doesn't want always to be bothering
      me to tell her whether there's an accent in one word, or
      two 's's' in another. Saves time and trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans applauded softly with pink finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I knew it was you!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, clearly (though almost without intention) Major Ames
      had gone too far to retreat: also retreat implied a flat
      contradiction of what Mrs. Evans said she knew, which would
      have been a rudeness from which his habitual gallantry
      naturally revolted. Consequently, being unable to retreat,
      he had to make himself as safe as possible, to entrench
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it's a little extravagance," he said. "Indeed, Amy
      thinks it is, and I never mention the subject of menu-cards
      to her. She's apt to turn the subject a bit abruptly on the
      word menu-card. Dear Amy! After all, it would be a very
      dull affair, our pleasant life down here, if we all
      completely agreed with each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little sigh, shaking her head, and smiling at
      her sweet-peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, how often I think that too," she said. "At least, now
      you say it, I feel I have often thought it. It is so true.
      Dear Wilfred is such an angel to me, you see! Whatever I
      do, he is sure to think right. But sometimes you wonder
      whether the people who know you best, really understand
      you. It is like--it is like learning things by heart. If
      you learn a thing by heart, you so often cease to think
      what it means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans, it must be confessed, did not mean anything
      very precisely by this: her life, that is to say, was not
      at all circumstanced in the manner that her speech implied
      it to be, except in so far that she often wished that more
      amusing things happened to her, and that she would not so
      soon be forty years old. But she certainly intended Major
      Ames to attach to her words their natural implication: she
      wanted to seem vaguely unappreciated. At the same time, she
      desired him to see that she in no way blamed her dear
      unconscious Wilfred. If Major Ames thought that, it would
      spoil a most essential feature of the picture she wished to
      present of herself. Why she wished to present it was also
      quite easy of comprehension. She wanted to be interesting,
      and was by nature silly. The fact that she was close on
      thirty-eight largely conduced to her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames made a perfectly satisfactory interpretation of
      it. He saw all the things he was meant to see, and nothing
      else. And it was deliciously delivered, so affectionately
      as regarded Wilfred, so shyly as regarded herself. He
      instantly made the astounding mental discovery that she was
      somehow not very happy, owing to a failure in domestic
      affinities. He felt also that it was intuitive of him to
      have guessed that, since she had not actually said it. And
      he was tremendously conscious of the seduction of her
      presence, as she sat there, cool and white on this hot
      morning, putting in the last of the sweet-peas he had
      brought her. She looked enchantingly young and fresh, and
      evidently she found something in him which disposed her to
      confidences. In justice to him, it may be said that he did
      not inquire in his own mind as to what that was, but it was
      easy to see she trusted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we all must feel that at times, my dear lady," he
      said, anxious to haul the circumstance of his own home into
      the discussion. "I suppose that all of us who are not quite
      old yet, not quite quite old yet, let us say, in order to
      include me, feel at times that life is not giving us all
      that it might give; that people do not really understand
      us. No doubt many people, and I daresay those, as you said,
      who know one best, do not understand one. And then we
      mustn't mind that, but march straight on, march straight
      on, according to orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up very straight in his chair as if about to march,
      as he made thrillingly noble remarks, and hit himself a
      couple of sounding blows with his clenched fist on his
      broad chest. Then a sudden suspicion seized him that he had
      displayed an almost too Spartan unflinchingness, as if
      soldiers had no hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then perhaps we shall meet some one who does
      understand us," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The critical observer, the cynic, and that rarest of all
      products, the entirely sincere and straightforward person,
      would have found in this conversation nothing that would
      move anything beyond his raillery or disgust. Here sitting
      under the mulberry-tree in this pleasant garden, on a
      Sunday morning, were two people, the man nearly fifty, the
      woman nearly forty, both trying, with God knows how many
      little insincerities by the way, to draw near to each
      other. Both had reached ages that were dangerous to such as
      had lived (even as they had) extremely respectable and
      well-conducted lives, without any paramount reason for
      their morality. About Major Ames' mode of life before he
      married, which, after all, was at the early age of
      twenty-five, nothing need be said, because there is really
      very little to say, and in any case the conduct of a young
      man not yet in his twenty-fifth year has almost nothing to
      do with the character of the same man when he is
      forty-seven. In that very long interval he had conducted
      himself always as a married man should, and those years,
      married as he was to a woman much his senior, had not been
      at all discreditably passed. This chronicle does not in the
      least intend to impute to him any high principled
      character, for he had nothing of Galahad in his
      composition. But he was not a satyr. Consequently, for this
      is part of the ironical composition of a man--just in the
      years with which we are dealing, at a time of life when a
      man might have been condoned for having sown wild oats and
      seen the huskiness of them, he was in that far more
      precarious position of not having sown them (except, so to
      speak, in the smallest of flower-pots), nor of having
      experienced the jejune quality of such a crop. But it is
      not implied that he now regretted the respectability of
      those twenty-two years. He did not do so: he had had a
      happy and contented life, but he would soon be old. Nor did
      he now at all contemplate adventure. Merely an Odysseus who
      had never voyaged wondered what voyaging was like. He was
      not in love with this seductive long-lashed face that bent
      over the sweet-peas he had brought her. But if he had the
      picking of those sweet-peas over again, he would probably
      have picked the very best, regardless of the fact that he
      wanted the seeds for next year's sowing. So as regards him
      the cynic's sneers would have been out of place; he
      contemplated nothing that the cynic would have called "a
      conquest." The sincere, straightforward gentleman would
      have been equally excessive in his disgust. There was
      nothing, except the slight absurdity of Major Ames' nature,
      to justify either laughter or tears. He was a moderate man
      of middle-age, about as well intentioned as most of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans, perhaps, was less laudable, and more deserved
      laughter and tears. She had consciously tried to produce a
      false impression without saying false things--a lamentable
      posture. She had wanted, as was her nature, to attract
      without being correspondingly attracted. She was prepared
      for him to go a little further, which is characteristic of
      the flirt. She succeeded, as the flirt usually does.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last sentence was received in silence, and he thought
      well to repeat it with slight variation. The theme was
      clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may meet some one who understands us," he said. "Who
      looks into us, not at us, eh? Who sees not what we wish
      only, but what we want."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the last sweet-pea into the wire-netting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, yes," she said; "how beautiful that distinction
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not aware of its being particularly beautiful, until
      she mentioned it, but then it struck him that it was rather
      fine. Also the respectability of all his long years tugged
      at him, as with a chain. He was quite conscious that he was
      encouraged, and so he was slightly terrified. He had not
      much power of imagination, but he could picture to himself
      a very uncomfortable home. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Providence came to his aid--probably Providence. Church
      time was spent, and two black Aberdeen terriers, followed
      by Elsie, followed by Dr. Evans, came out of the
      drawing-room door on to the lawn. They were all in the
      genial exhilaration that accompanies the sense of duty
      done. The dogs had been let out from the house, where they
      were penned on Sunday morning to prevent their unexpected
      appearance in church; the other two had been let out from
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Evans had most clearly left church behind him: he
      had also left in the house not only his top hat but his
      coat, as befitted the heat of the morning, and appeared,
      stout, and strong, and brisk. Elsie was less vigorous: she
      sat down on the grass as soon as she reached the shade of
      the tree. She had the good sense to shake hands with Major
      Ames first: otherwise her mother would have made remarks to
      him about her manners. But she was markedly less elderly
      now than she had been at the formal dinner-party of the
      night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Evans arrived last at the mulberry-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jove! what jolly flowers," he said. "That's you, Major
      Ames, isn't it? How de'do? Well, little woman, how goes it?
      You did well not to come to church. Awfully hot it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a very long sermon, Daddy," said Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-two minutes: I timed it. Very interesting, though.
      You'll stop to lunch, Major Ames, won't you? We lunch at
      one always on Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Major Ames knew quite well that there was going to be
      at his house the lunch that followed parties, the
      resurrection lunch of what was dead last night. There would
      be little bits of salmon slightly greyer than on the
      evening before, peeping out from the fresh salad that
      covered them. There would be some sort of
      <i>chaud-froid;</i> there would be a pink and viscous fluid
      which was the debilitated descendant of the strawberry ice
      which Amy had given them. There would also be several
      people, including Mrs. Altham, who had not been bidden to
      the feast last night, but who, since they came according to
      the authorized Riseborough version of festivities, to the
      lunch next day, would certainly be bidden to dinner on the
      next occasion. Also, he knew well, he would have to say to
      Mrs. Altham, "Amy has given us cold luncheon to-day. Well,
      I don't mind a cold luncheon on as hot a day as it is.
      <i>Chaud-froid</i> of chicken, Mrs. Altham. I think you'll
      find that Amy's cook understands <i>chaud-froid."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time he knew that <i>chaud-froid</i> meant a
      dinner-party on the night before. So did the viscous fluid
      in the jelly glasses, so did everything else. And of course
      Mrs. Altham knew: everybody knew all about the lunch that
      followed a dinner-party. Even if the dinner-party last
      night had been as secret as George the Fourth's marriage
      with Mrs. Fitzherbert, the lunch to-day would have made it
      as public as any function at St. Peter's, Eaton Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought over the unimaginable dislocation in all this
      routine that his absence would entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if I ought to," he said. "I fancy Amy told me she
      had a few friends to lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie Evans looked up at him. Infinitesimal as was the
      point as to whether he should lunch here or at home, she
      knew that she definitely entered herself against his wife
      at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, do stop," she said. "If Cousin Amy has a few friends
      why shouldn't we have one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up: he nearly took off his hat again, but again
      remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it as a command," he said. "Am I ordered to stop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Telephone to Mrs. Ames, Wilfred, and say that
      Major Ames is lunching with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>" les ordres de votre Majest,"</i> said he brightly,
      forgetting for the moment that his wife came to him for
      help with the elusive language of our neighbours. But the
      Frenchness of his bearing and sentiment, perhaps, diverted
      attention from the curious character of his grammar.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, as inevitable as the return of day that
      Mrs. Altham should start half-an-hour earlier than was
      necessary to go to church that morning, in order to return
      to Mrs. Brooks, who had been dining last night at the
      Ames', a couple of books that had been lent her a month or
      two ago, and that Mrs. Brooks should recount to her the
      unusual incident of Harry's taking Mrs. Evans into the
      garden after dinner, and giving her a gradually growing
      bouquet of roses torn from his father's trees. Indeed, it
      was difficult to settle satisfactorily which part of
      Harry's conduct was the most astounding, with such
      completeness had he revolted against both beneficiaries of
      the fifth commandment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They can't have been out in the garden for less than
      twenty minutes," said Mrs. Brooks; "and I shouldn't wonder
      if it was more. For we had scarcely settled ourselves after
      the gentlemen came in from the dining-room, when they went
      out, and I'm sure we had hardly got talking again after
      they came back, before my maid was announced. To be sure
      the gentlemen sat a long time after dinner before joining
      us, which I notice is always the case when General
      Fortescue is at a party, but it can't have been less than
      half-an-hour that they were in the garden now one comes to
      add it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks surveyed for a moment in silence her piece of
      embroidery. Not for a moment must it be supposed that she
      would have done embroidery for her own dress on Sunday
      morning; this was a frontal for the lectern at St.
      Barnabas, which would make it impossible for Mrs. Ames to
      decorate the lectern any more with her flowers. There was a
      cross, and a crown, and some initials, and some rays of
      light, and a heart, and some passion flowers, and a dove
      worked on it, with a profusion of gold thread that was
      positively American in its opulence. Hitherto, the lectern
      had always been the field of one of Mrs. Ames' most telling
      embellishments. When this embroidery was finished (which it
      soon would be) she would be driven from the lectern in
      disorder and discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very rich effect," said Mrs. Altham sympathetically.
      "Half-an-hour! Dear me! And then I think you said she came
      back with a dozen roses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks closed her eyes, and made a short calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than a dozen," she said. "I daresay there were twenty
      roses. It was very marked, very marked indeed. And if you
      ask me what I think of Mrs. Ames' plan of asking husband
      without wife and wife without husband, I must say I do not
      like it at all. Depend upon it, if Dr. Evans had come too,
      there would have been no walking about in the garden with
      our Master Harry. But far be it from me to say there was
      any harm in it, far! I hope I am not one who condemns other
      people's actions because I would not commit them myself.
      All I know is that the first time my late dear husband
      asked me to walk about the garden after dinner with him, he
      proposed to me; and the second time he asked me to walk in
      the garden with him he proposed again, and I accepted him.
      But then I was not engaged to anybody else at the time, far
      less married, like Mrs. Evans. But it is none of my
      business, I am glad to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, no, it does not concern us," said Mrs. Altham,
      with avidity; "and as you say, there may be no harm in it
      at all. But young men are very impressionable, even if most
      unattractive, and I call it distinct encouragement to a
      young man to walk about after dinner in the garden with
      him, and receive a present of roses. And I'm sure Mrs.
      Evans is old enough to be his mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks tacked down a length of gold thread which was
      to form part of the longest ray of all, and made another
      little calculation. It was not completely satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, she is old enough to know better," she said; "but
      I have noticed that being old enough to know better often
      makes people behave worse. Mind, I do not blame her: there
      is nothing I detest so much as this censorious attitude;
      and I only say that if I gave so much encouragement to any
      young man I should blame myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the dinner?" asked Mrs. Altham. "At least, I need not
      ask that, since I am going to lunch there, and so I shall
      soon know as well as you what there was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks smiled in a rather superior manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never know what I am eating," she said. And she looked
      as if it disagreed with her, too, whatever it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not particularly thrilling, for though it was
      generally known that Harry had an emotional temperament and
      wrote amorous poems, he appeared to Mrs. Altham an
      improbable Lothario. In any case, the slight interest that
      this aroused in her was nothing compared to that which
      awaited her and her husband when they arrived for lunch at
      Mrs. Ames'.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a long-standing feud between Mrs. Altham and
      her hostess on the subject of punctuality. About two years
      ago Mrs. Ames had arrived at Mrs. Altham's at least ten
      minutes late for dinner, and Mrs. Altham had very properly
      retorted by arriving a quarter of an hour late when next
      she was bidden to dinner with Mrs. Ames, though that
      involved sitting in a dark cab for ten minutes at the
      corner of the next turning. So, next time that Mrs. Altham
      "hoped to have the pleasure of seeing you and Major Ames at
      dinner on Thursday at a quarter to eight," she asked the
      rest of her guests at eight. With the effect that Mrs. Ames
      and her husband arrived a few minutes before anybody else,
      and Riseborough generally considered that Mrs. Altham had
      scored. Since then there had been but a sort of desultory
      pea-shooting kept up, such as would harm nobody, and to-day
      Mrs. Altham and her husband arrived certainly within ten
      minutes of the hour named. Mr. Pettit, who generally
      lunched with Mrs. Ames or Mrs. Brooks on Sunday, was
      already there with his sister. Harry was morosely fidgeting
      in a corner, and Mrs. Ames was the only other person
      present in the small sitting-room where she received her
      guests, instead of troubling them to go up to the
      drawing-room and instantly to go down again. She gave Mrs.
      Altham her fat little hand, and then made this remarkable
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are not waiting for anybody else, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which they went into lunch, and Harry sat at the head
      of the table, instead of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was in her most conversational mood, and it was
      not until the <i>chaud-froid,</i> consisting mainly of the
      legs of chickens pasted over with a yellow sauce that
      concealed the long blue hair-roots with which Nature has
      adorned their lower extremities, was being handed round,
      that Mrs. Altham had opportunity to ask the question that
      had been effervescing like an antiseptic lozenge on the tip
      of her tongue ever since she remarked the Major's absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where is Major Ames?" she asked. "I hope he is not
      ill? I thought he looked far from well at Mrs. Evans'
      garden-party yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames set her mind at rest with regard to the second
      point, and inflamed it on the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" she said. "Did you think he looked ill? How good
      of you to ask after him. But Lyndhurst is quite well. Mr.
      Pettit, a little more chicken? After your sermon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pettit had a shrewd, ugly, delightful face, very lean,
      very capable. Humanly speaking, he probably abhorred Mrs.
      Ames. Humanely speaking, he knew there was a great deal of
      good in her, and a quantity of debatable stuff. He smiled,
      showing thick white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before and after my sermon," he said. "Also before a
      children's service and a Bible class. I cannot help
      thinking that God forgot his poor clergymen when he defined
      the seventh day as one of rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames hid a small portion of her little face with her
      little hand. She always said that Mr. Pettit was not like a
      clergyman at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How naughty of you," she said. "But I must correct you.
      The seventh day has become the first day now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry gave vent to a designedly audible sigh. The Omar Club
      were chiefly atheists, and he felt bound to uphold their
      principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the sort of thing that confuses me," he said. "Mr.
      Pettit says Sunday was called a day of rest, and my mother
      says that God meant what we call Monday, or Saturday. I
      have been behaving as if it was Tuesday or Wednesday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pettit gave him a kindly glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, my dear boy," he said. "Spend your Tuesday or
      Wednesday properly and God won't mind whether it is
      Thursday or Friday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry pushed back his lank hair, and became Omar-ish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you fast on Friday, may I ask?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames looked pained, and tried to think of something to
      say. She failed. But Mrs. Altham thought without
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose Major Ames is away, Mr. Harry?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, though her intentions might easily be supposed
      to be amiable, she was not allowed the privilege of being
      replied to, for Mr. Pettit cheerfully answered Harry's
      question, without a shadow of embarrassment, just as if he
      did not mind what the Omar Khayyam Club thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do, my dear fellow," he said, "because our
      Lord and dearest friend died that day. He allows us to
      watch and pray with Him an hour or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry appeared indulgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curious," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pettit looked at him for just the space of time any one
      looks at the speaker, with cheerful cordiality of face, and
      then turned to his mother again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you at church next Sunday," he said, "with a fat
      purse, to be made thin. I am going to have an offertory to
      finance a children's treat. I want to send every child in
      the parish to the sea-side for a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry interrupted in the critical manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the sea-side?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pettit turned to him with unabated cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How right to ask!" he said. "Because the sea is His, and
      He made it! Also, they will build sand-castles, and pick up
      shells. You must come too, my dear Harry, and help us to
      give them a nice day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry felt that this was a Philistine here, who needed to
      be put in his place. He was not really a very rude youth,
      but one who felt it incumbent on him to oppose
      Christianity, which he regarded as superstition. A bright
      idea came into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But His hands prepared the dry land," he said, "on the
      same supposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; and as the dear mites have always seen the dry
      land," said Mr. Pettit, with the utmost good-humour, "we
      want to show them that God thought of something they never
      thought of. And then there are the sand-castles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was tired, and did not proceed to crush Mr. Pettit
      with the atheistical arguments that were but commonplace to
      the Omar Khayyam Club. He was not worth argument: you could
      only really argue with the enlightened people who
      fundamentally agreed with you, and he was sure that Mr.
      Pettit did not fulfil that requirement. So, indulgently, he
      turned to Mrs. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you at Mrs. Evans' garden-party yesterday," he said.
      "I think she is the most wonderful person I ever met. She
      was dining here last night, and I took her into the
      garden--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And showed her the roses," said Mrs. Altham, unable to
      restrain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry became a parody of himself, though that might seem to
      be a feat of insuperable difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I supposed it would get about," he said. "That is the
      worst of a little place like this. Whatever you do is
      instantly known."
    </p>
    <p>
      The slightly viscous remains of the strawberry ice were
      being handed, and Mr. Pettit was talking to Mrs. Ames and
      his sister from a pitiably Christian standpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you hear?" asked Harry, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely that she and you went out into the garden after
      dinner, and that you picked roses for her--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry pushed back his lank hair with his bony hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard all," he said. "There was nothing more than
      that. I did not see her home. Her carriage did not come:
      there was some mistake about it, I suppose. But it was my
      father who saw her home, not I."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid down the spoon with which he had been consuming the
      viscous fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you hear that I saw her home, Mrs. Altham," he said,
      "tell them it is not true. From what you have already told
      me, I gather there is talk going on. There is no reason for
      such talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, and then a line or two of the intensely
      Swinburnian effusion which he had written last night
      fermented in his head, making him infinitely more
      preposterous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you that at present there is no reason for such
      talk," he said earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mrs. Altham, with her wide interest in all that
      concerned anybody else, might be expected to feel the
      intensest curiosity on such a topic, but somehow she felt
      very little, since she knew that behind the talk there was
      really very little topic, and the gallant misgivings of
      poor, ugly Harry seemed to her destitute of any real
      thrill. On the other hand, she wanted very much to know
      where Major Ames was, and being endowed with the
      persistence of the household cat, which you may turn out of
      a particular arm-chair a hundred times, without producing
      the slightest discouragement in its mind, she reverted to
      her own subject again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure there is no reason for such talk, Mr. Harry,"
      she said, with strangely unwelcome conviction, "and I will
      be sure to contradict it if ever I hear it. I am so glad to
      hear Major Ames is not ill. I was afraid that his absence
      from lunch to-day might mean that he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Harry, as a matter of fact, had no idea where his
      father was, since the telephone message had been received
      by Mrs. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father is quite well," he said. "He was picking sweet-peas
      half the morning. He picked a great bunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham looked round: the table was decorated with the
      roses of the dinner-party of the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then where are the sweet-peas?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harry was not in the least interested in the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," he said. "Perhaps they are in the next
      room. I showed Mrs. Evans last night how the La France
      roses looked blue when dusk fell. She had never noticed it,
      though they turn as blue as her eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How curious!" said Mrs. Altham. "But I didn't see the
      sweet-peas in the next room. Surely if there had been a
      quantity of them I should have noticed them. Or perhaps
      they are in the drawing-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Mrs. Ames' voice was heard from the other
      end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then shall we have our coffee outside?" she said. "Harry,
      if you will ring the bell--"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the pushing back of chairs, and Mrs. Altham
      passed along the table to the French windows that opened on
      to the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear Major Ames has been picking the loveliest
      sweet-peas all the morning," she said to her hostess. "It
      would be such a pleasure to see them. I always admire Major
      Ames' sweet-peas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was unfortunate, for Mrs. Altham desired
      information herself, but by her speech she had only
      succeeded in giving information to Mrs. Ames, who guessed
      without the slightest difficulty where the sweet-peas had
      gone, which she had not yet known had been picked. She was
      already considerably annoyed with her husband for his
      unceremonious desertion of her luncheon-party, and was
      aware that Mrs. Altham would cause the fact to be as well
      known in Riseborough as if it had been inserted in the
      column of local intelligence in the county paper. But she
      felt she would sooner put it there herself than let Mrs.
      Altham know where he and his sweet-peas were. She had no
      greater objection (or if she had, she studiously concealed
      it from herself even) to his going to lunch in this
      improvising manner with Mrs. Evans than if he had gone to
      lunch with anybody else; what she minded was his
      non-appearance at an institution so firmly established and
      so faithfully observed as the lunch that followed the
      dinner-party. But at the moment her entire mind was set on
      thwarting Mrs. Altham. She looked interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, has he been picking sweet-peas?" she said. "I must
      scold him if it was only that which kept him away from
      church. I don't know what he has done with them. Very
      likely they are in his dressing-room: he often likes to
      have flowers there. But as you admire his sweet-peas so
      much, pray walk down the garden, and look at them. You will
      find them in their full beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, was not in the least what Mrs. Altham
      wanted, since she did not care two straws for the rest of
      the sweet-peas. But life was scarcely worth living unless
      she knew where those particular sweet-peas were. As for
      their being in his dressing-room, she felt that Mrs. Ames
      must have a very poor opinion of her intellectual
      capacities, if she thought that an old wife's tale like
      that would satisfy it. In this she was partly right: Mrs.
      Ames had indeed no opinion at all of her mind; on the other
      hand, she did not for a moment suppose that this suggestion
      about the dressing-room would content that feeble organ. It
      was not designed to: the object was to stir it to a wilder
      and still unsatisfied curiosity. It perfectly succeeded,
      and from by-ways Mrs. Altham emerged full-speed, like a
      motor-car, into the high-road of direct question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure they are lovely," she said. "And where is Major
      Ames lunching?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames raised the pieces of her face where there might
      have been eyebrows in other days. She told one of the
      truths that Bismarck loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not tell me before he went out," she said. "Perhaps
      Harry knows. Harry, where is your father lunching?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was ludicrous. As if it was possible that any wife
      in Riseborough did not know where her husband was lunching!
      Harry apparently did not know either, and Mrs. Ames,
      tasting the joys of the bull-baiter, goaded Mrs. Altham
      further by pointedly asking Parker, when she brought the
      coffee, if she knew where the Major was lunching. Of course
      Parker did not, and so Parker was told to cut Mrs. Altham a
      nice bunch of sweet-peas to carry away with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pleasant duty of thwarting undue curiosity being
      performed, Mrs. Ames turned to Mr. Pettit, though she had
      not quite done with Mrs. Altham yet. For she had heard on
      the best authority that Mrs. Altham occasionally indulged
      in the disgusting and unfeminine habit of cigarette
      smoking. Mrs. Brooks had several times seen her walking
      about her garden with a cigarette, and she had told Mrs.
      Taverner, who had told Mrs. Ames. The evidence was
      overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pettit, I don't think any of us mind the smell of
      tobacco," she said, "when it is out of doors, so pray have
      a cigarette. Harry will give you one. Ah! I forgot! Perhaps
      Mrs. Altham does not like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham hastened to correct that impression. At the
      same time she had a subtle and not quite comfortable sense
      that Mrs. Ames knew all about her and her cigarettes, which
      was exactly the impression which that lady sought to
      convey.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tactics were all sound enough in their way, but a
      profounder knowledge of human nature would have led Mrs.
      Ames not to press home her victory with so merciless a
      hand. In her determination to thwart Mrs. Altham's odious
      curiosity, she had let it be seen that she was thwarting
      it: she should not, for instance, have asked Parker if she
      knew of the Major's whereabouts, for it only served to
      emphasize the undoubted fact that Mrs. Ames knew (that
      might be taken for granted) and that she knew that Parker
      did not, for otherwise she would surely not have asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently Mrs. Altham (erroneously, as far as that went)
      came to the conclusion that the Major was lunching alone
      where his wife did not wish him to lunch alone. And in the
      next quarter of an hour, while they all sat on the
      verandah, she devoted the mind which her hostess so
      despised, to a rapid review of all houses of this
      description. Instantly almost, the wrong scent which she
      was following led her to the right quarry. She argued,
      erroneously, the existence of a pretty woman, and there was
      a pretty woman in Riseborough. It is hardly necessary to
      state that she made up her mind to call on that pretty
      woman without delay. She would be very much surprised if
      she did not find there an immense bunch of sweet-peas and
      perhaps their donor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames' guests soon went their ways, Mr. Pettit and his
      sister to the children's service at three, the Althams on
      their detective mission, and she was left to herself,
      except in so far as Harry, asleep in a basket chair in the
      garden, can be considered companionship. She was not gifted
      with any very great acuteness of imagination, but this
      afternoon she found herself capable of conjuring up
      (indeed, she was incapable of not doing so) a certain
      amount of vague disquiet. Indeed, she tried to put it away,
      and refresh her mind with the remembrance of her thwarting
      Mrs. Altham, but though her disquiet was but vague, and was
      concerned with things that had at present no real existence
      at all, whereas her victory over that inquisitive lady was
      fresh and recent, the disquiet somehow was of more pungent
      quality, and at last she faced it, instead of attempting
      any longer to poke it away out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie Evans was undeniably a good-looking woman,
      undeniably the Major had been considerably attracted last
      night by her. Undeniably also he had done a very strange
      thing in stopping to have his lunch there, when he knew
      perfectly well that there were people lunching with them at
      home for that important rite of eating up the remains of
      last night's dinner. Beyond doubt he had taken her this
      present of sweet-peas, of which Mrs. Altham had so
      obligingly informed her; beyond doubt, finally, she was
      herself ten years her husband's senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that Mrs. Ames was not imaginative, but
      indeed, there seemed to be sufficient here, when it was all
      brought together, to occupy a very prosaic and literal
      mind. It was not as if these facts were all new to her:
      that disparity of age between herself and her husband had
      long lain dark and ominous, like a distant thunder-cloud on
      the horizon of her mind. Hitherto, it had been stationary
      there, not apparently coming any closer, and not giving any
      hint of the potential tempest which might lurk within it.
      But now it seemed to have moved a little up the sky, and
      (though this might be mere fancy on her part), there came
      from it some drowsy and distant echo of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that her disquiet expressed itself
      in Mrs. Ames' mind in terms of metaphor like this, for she
      was practically incapable of metaphor. She said to herself
      merely that she was ten years older than her husband. That
      she had known ever since they married (indeed, she had
      known it before), but till now the fact had never seemed
      likely to be of any significance to her. And yet her
      grounds for supposing that it might be about to become
      significant were of the most unsubstantial sort. Certainly
      if Lyndhurst had not gone out to lunch to-day, she would
      never have dreamed of finding disquiet in the happenings of
      the evening before; indeed, apart from Harry's absurd
      expedition into the garden, the party had been a markedly
      successful one, and she had determined to give more of
      those undomestic entertainments. But the principle of them
      assumed a strangely different aspect when her husband
      accepted an invitation of the kind instead of lunching at
      home, and that aspect presented itself in vivid colours
      when she reflected that he was ten years her junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was a practical woman, and though her imagination
      had run unreasonably riot, so she told herself, over these
      late events, so that she already contemplated a contingency
      that she had no real reason to anticipate, she considered
      what should be her practical conduct if this remote state
      of affairs should cease to be remote. She had altogether
      passed from being in love with her husband, so much so,
      indeed, that she could not recall, with any sense of
      reality, what that unquiet sensation was like. But she had
      been in love with him years ago, and that still gave her a
      sense of possession over him. She had not been in the habit
      of guarding her possession, since there had never been any
      reason to suppose that anybody wanted to take it away, but
      she remembered with sufficient distinctness the sense that
      Lyndhurst's garden was becoming to him the paramount
      interest in his life. At the time that sense had been
      composed of mixed feelings: neglect and relief were its
      constituents. He had ceased to expect from her that
      indefinable sensitiveness which is one of the prime
      conditions of love, and the growing atrophy of his demands
      certainly corresponded with her own inclinations. At the
      same time, though this cessation on his part of the
      imperative need of her, was a relief, she resented it. She
      would have wished him to continue being in love with her on
      credit, so to speak, without the settlement of the bill
      being applied for. Years had passed since then, but to-day
      that secondary discontent assumed a primary importance
      again. It was more acute now than it had ever been, for her
      possession was not being quietly absorbed into the culture
      of impersonal flowers, but, so it seemed possible, was
      directly threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the situation which her imagination presented her
      with, practically put, and she proceeded to consider it
      from a practical standpoint. What was she to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the justice to acknowledge that the first clear
      signals of coolness in their mutual relations, now fifteen
      years ago, had been chiefly flown by her: she had
      essentially welcomed his transference of affection to his
      garden, though she had secretly resented it. At the least,
      the cooling had been condoned by her. Probably that had
      been a mistake on her part, and she determined now to
      rectify it. She, pathetically enough, felt herself young
      still, and to confirm herself in her view, she took the
      trouble to go indoors, and look at herself in the glass
      that hung in the hall. It was inevitable that she should
      see there not what she really saw, but what, in the main,
      she desired to see. Her hair, always slightly faded in
      tone, was not really grey, and even if there were signs of
      greyness in it there was nothing easier, if you could trust
      the daily advertisements in the papers, than to restore the
      colour, not by dyes, but by "purely natural means." There
      had been an advertisement of one such desirable lotion, she
      remembered, in the paper to-day, which she had noticed was
      supplied by any chemist. Certainly there was a little grey
      in her hair: that would be easy to remedy. That act of
      mental frankness led on to another. There were certain
      premonitory symptoms of stringiness about her throat and of
      loose skin round her mouth and eyes. But who could keep
      abreast of the times at all, and not know that there were
      skin-foods which were magical in their effect? There was
      one which had impressed itself on her not long before: an
      actress had written in its praise, affirming that her
      wrinkles had vanished with three nights' treatment. Then
      there was a little, just a little, sallowness of
      complexion, but after all, she had always been rather
      sallow. It was a fortunate circumstance: when she got hot
      she never got crimson in the face like poor Mrs. Taverner.
      . . . She was going to town next week for a night, in order
      to see her dentist, a yearly precaution, unproductive of
      pain, for her teeth were really excellent, regular in
      shape, white, undecayed. Lyndhurst, in his early days, had
      told her they were like pearls, and she had told him he
      talked nonsense. They were just as much like pearls still,
      only he did not tell her so. He, poor fellow, had had great
      trouble in this regard, but it might be supposed his
      trouble was over now, since artifice had done its utmost
      for him. She was much younger than him there, though his
      last set fitted beautifully. But probably Millie had seen
      they were not real. And then he was distinctly gouty, which
      she was not. Often had she heard his optimistic assertion
      that an hour's employment with the garden-roller rendered
      all things of rheumatic tendency an impossibility. But she,
      though publicly she let these random statements pass, and
      even endorsed them, knew the array of bottles that
      beleaguered the washing-stand in his dressing-room, where
      the sweet-peas were not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silent colloquy with the mirror in the hall occupied
      her some ten minutes, but the ten minutes sufficed for the
      arrival of one conclusion--namely, that she did not intend
      to be an old woman yet. Subtle art, the art of the
      hair-restorer (which was not a dye), the art of the
      skin-feeder must be invoked. She no longer felt at all old,
      now that there was a possibility of her husband's feeling
      young. And lip-salve: perhaps lip-salve, yet that seemed
      hardly necessary: a few little bitings and mumblings of her
      lips between her excellent teeth seemed to restore to them
      a very vivid colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to the verandah, where her little
      luncheon-party had had their coffee, and pondered the
      practical man&oelig;uvres of her campaign of invasion into
      the territory of youth which had once been hers. The lotion
      for the hair, as she verified by a consultation with the
      Sunday paper, took but a fortnight's application to
      complete its work. The wrinkle treatment was easily
      comprised in that, for it took, according to the eminent
      actress, no more than three days. It might therefore be
      wiser not to let the work of rejuvenation take place under
      Lyndhurst's eye, for there might be critical passages in
      it. But she could go away for a fortnight (a fortnight was
      the utmost time necessary for the wonderful lotion to
      restore faded colour) and return again after correspondence
      that indicated that she felt much better and younger.
      Several times before she had gone to stay alone with a
      friend of hers on the coast of Norfolk: there would be
      nothing in the least remarkable in her doing it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      An objection loomed in sight. If there was any reality in
      the supposition that prompted her desire to seem young
      again--namely, a possible attraction of her husband towards
      Millie Evans, she would but be giving facility and
      encouragement to that by her absence. But then, immediately
      the wisdom of the course, stronger than the objection to
      it, presented itself. Infinitely the wiser plan for her was
      to act as if unconscious of any such danger, to disarm him
      by her obvious rejection of any armour of her own. She must
      either watch him minutely or not at all. Mr. Pettit had
      alluded in his sermon that morning to the finer of the two
      attitudes when he reminded them that love thought no evil.
      It seemed to poor Mrs. Ames that if by her conduct she
      appeared to think no evil, it came to the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her behaviour towards Lyndhurst, when he should come back
      from Millie's house, followed as a corollary. She would be
      completely genial: she would hope he had had a pleasant
      lunch, and, if he made any apology for his absence, assure
      him that it was quite unnecessary. Her charity would carry
      her even further than that: she would say that his absence
      had been deplored by her guests, but that she had been so
      glad that he had done as he felt inclined. She would hope
      that Millie was not tired with her party, and that she and
      her husband would come to dine with them again soon. It
      must be while Harry was at home, for he was immensely
      attracted by Millie. So good for a boy to think about a
      nice woman like that.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames carried out her programme with pathetic fidelity.
      Her husband did not get home till nearly tea-time, and she
      welcomed him with a cordiality that would have been unusual
      even if he had not gone out to lunch at all. And to do him
      justice, it must be confessed that his wife's scheme, as
      already recounted, was framed to meet a situation which at
      present had no real existence, except in the mind of a wife
      wedded to a younger husband. There were data for the
      situation, so to speak, rather than there was danger of it.
      He, on his side, was well aware of the irregularity of his
      conduct, and was prepared to accept, without retaliation, a
      modicum of blame for it. But no blame at all awaited him;
      instead of that a cordiality so genuine that, in spite of
      the fact that a particularly good dinner was provided him,
      the possible parallel of the prodigal son did not so much
      as suggest itself to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had retired to his bedroom soon after dinner with a
      certain wildness of eye which portended poetry rather than
      repose, and after he had gone his father commented in the
      humorous spirit about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old Harry!" he said. "Case of lovely woman, eh, Amy?
      I was just the same at his age, until I met you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      This topic of Harry's admiration for Mrs. Evans, which his
      mother had intended to allude to, had not yet been touched
      on, and she responded cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think Harry is very much attracted by Millie, do you
      mean?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's not very difficult to see," he said. "Why,
      the rascal tore off a dozen of my best roses for her last
      night, though I hadn't the heart to scold him for it. Not a
      bad thing for a young fellow to burn a bit of incense
      before a charming woman like that. Keeps him out of
      mischief, makes him see what a nice woman is like. As I
      said, I used to do just the same myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me about it," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there was the Colonel's wife. God bless me, how I
      adored her. I must have been just about Harry's age, for I
      had only lately joined, and she was a woman getting on for
      forty. Good thing, too, for me, as I say, for it kept me
      out of mischief. They used to say she encouraged me, but I
      don't believe it. Every woman likes to know that she's
      admired, eh? She doesn't snub a boy who takes her out in
      the garden, and picks his father's roses for her. But we
      mustn't have Harry boring her with his attentions. That'll
      never do."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Mrs. Ames of singularly little consequence
      whether Harry bored Millie Evans or not. She would much
      have preferred to be assured that her husband did. But the
      subsequent conversation did not reassure her as to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice little woman, she is," he said. "Thoroughly nice
      little woman, and naturally enough, my dear, since she is
      your cousin, she likes being treated in neighbourly
      fashion. We had a great talk after lunch to-day, and I'm
      sorry for her, sorry for her. I think we ought to do all we
      can to make life pleasant for her. Drop in to tea, or drop
      in to lunch, as I did to-day. A doctor's wife, you know.
      She told me that some days she scarcely set eyes on her
      husband, and when she did, he could think of nothing but
      microbes. And there's really nobody in Riseborough, except
      you and me, with whom she feels--dear me, what's that
      French word--yes, with whom she feels in her proper
      <i>milieu.</i> I should like us to be on such terms with
      her--you being her cousin--that we could always telephone
      to say we were dropping in, and that she would feel equally
      free to drop in. Dropping in, you know: that's the real
      thing; not to be obliged to wait till you are asked, or to
      accept weeks ahead, as one has got to do for some formal
      dinner-party. I should like to feel that we mightn't be
      surprised to find her picking sweet-peas in the garden, and
      that she wouldn't be surprised to find you or me sitting
      under her mulberry-tree, waiting for her to come in. After
      all, intimacy only begins when formality ceases. Shall I
      give you some soda water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames did not want soda-water: she wanted to think. Her
      husband had completely expressed the attitude she meant to
      adopt, but her own adoption of it had presupposed a certain
      contrition on his part with regard to his unusual
      behaviour. But he gave her no time for thought, and
      proceeded to propose just the same sort of thing as she (in
      her magnanimity) had thought of suggesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner, now," he said. "Up till last night we have always
      been a bit formal about dinner here in Riseborough. If you
      asked General Snookes, you asked Mrs. Snookes; if you asked
      Admiral Jones, you asked Lady Jones. You led the way, my
      dear, about that, and what could have been pleasanter than
      our little party last night? Let us repeat it: let us be
      less formal. If you want to see Mr. Altham, ask him to
      come. Mrs. Altham, let us say, wants to ask me: let her ask
      me. Or if you meet Dr. Evans in the street, and he says it
      is lunch time, go and have lunch with him, without
      bothering about me. I shall do very well at home. I'm told
      that in London it is quite a constant practice to invite
      like that. And it seems to me very sensible."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had seemed very sensible to Mrs. Ames, when she
      had thought of it herself. It seemed a little more
      hazardous now. She was well aware that this plan had caused
      a vast amount of talk in Riseborough, the knowledge of
      which she had much enjoyed, since it was of the nature of
      subjects commenting on the movements of their queen,
      without any danger to her of dethronement. But she was not
      so sure that she enjoyed her husband's cordial endorsement
      of her innovation. Also, in his endorsement there was some
      little insincerity. He had taken as instance the chance of
      his wishing to dine without his wife at Mrs. Altham's, and
      they both knew how preposterous such a contingency would
      be. But did this only prepare the way for a further
      solitary excursion to Mrs. Evans'? Had Mrs. Evans asked him
      to dine there? She was immediately enlightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, we talked over your delightful dinner-party of
      last night," he said, "and agreed in the agreeableness of
      it. And she asked me to dine there, <i>en garon,</i> on
      Tuesday next. Of course, I said I must consult you first;
      you might have asked other people here, or we might be
      dining out together. I should not dream of upsetting any
      existing arrangement. I told her so: she quite understood.
      But if there was nothing going on, I promised to dine there
      <i>en garon."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      That phrase had evidently taken Major Ames' fancy; there
      was a ring of youth about it, and he repeated it with
      gusto. His wife, too, perfectly understood the secret smack
      of the lips with which he said it: she knew precisely how
      he felt. But she was wise enough to keep the consciousness
      of it completely out of her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means," she said; "we have no engagement for that
      night. And I am thinking of proposing myself for a little
      visit to Mrs. Bertram next week, Lyndhurst. I know she is
      at Overstrand now, and I think ten days on the east coast
      would do me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      He assented with a cordiality that equalled hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very wise, I am sure, my dear," he said. "I have thought
      this last day or two that you looked a little run down."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden misgiving seized her at this, for she knew quite
      well she neither looked nor felt the least run down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought perhaps you and Harry would take some little
      trip together while I was away," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind us, never mind us," said he. "We'll rub
      along, <i>en garon,</i> you know. I daresay some of our
      friends will take pity on us, and ask us to drop in."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not reassuring: nor would Mrs. Ames have been
      reassured if she could have penetrated at that moment
      unseen into Mrs. Altham's drawing-room. She and her husband
      had gone straight from Mrs. Ames' house that afternoon to
      call on Mrs. Evans, and had been told she was not at home.
      But Mrs. Altham of the eagle-eye had seen through the
      opened front door an immense bowl of sweet-peas on the hall
      table, and by it a straw hat with a riband of regimental
      colours round it. Circumstantial evidence could go no
      further, and now this indefatigable lady was looking out
      Major Ames in an old army list.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ames, Lyndhurst Percy," she triumphantly read out. "Born
      1860, and I daresay he is older than that, because if ever
      there was a man who wanted to be thought younger than his
      years, that's the one. So in any case, Henry, he is over
      forty-seven. And there's the front-door bell. It will be
      Mrs. Brooks. She said she would drop in for a chat after
      dinner."

      There was plenty to chat about that evening.

    <p>
      Mrs. Ames might or might not have been run down when she
      left Riseborough the following week, but nothing can be
      more certain than that she was considerably braced up seven
      days after that. The delicious freshness of winds off the
      North Sea, tempering the heat of brilliant summer suns, may
      have had something to do with it, and she certainly had
      more colour in her face than was usual with her, which was
      the legitimate effect of the felicitous weather. There was
      more colour in her hair also, and though that, no doubt,
      was a perfectly legitimate effect too, being produced by
      purely natural means, as the label on the bottle stated,
      the sun and wind were not accountable for this
      embellishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spent an afternoon in London--chiefly in Bond
      Street--on her way here, and had gone to a couple of
      addresses which she had secretly snipped out of the daily
      press. The expenditure of a couple of pounds, which was
      already yielding her immense dividends in encouragement and
      hope, had put her into possession of a bottle with a brush,
      a machine that, when you turned a handle, quivered
      violently like a motor-car that is prepared to start, and a
      small jar of opaque glass, which contained the miraculous
      skin-food. With these was being wrought the desired
      marvels; with these, as with a magician's rod, she was
      conjuring, so she believed, the remote enchantments of
      youth back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After quite a few days change became evident, and daily
      that change grew greater. As regards her hair, the cost,
      both of time and material, in this miracle-working, was of
      the smallest possible account. Morning and evening, after
      brushing it, she rubbed in a mere teaspoonful of a thin
      yellow liquid, which, as the advertisement stated, was
      quite free from grease or obnoxious smell, and did not
      stain the pillow. This was so simple that it really
      required faith to embark upon the treatment, for from the
      time of Hebrew prophets, mankind have found it easier to do
      "some great thing" than merely to wash in the Jordan. But
      Mrs. Ames, luckily, had shown her faith, and by the end of
      a week the marvellous lotion had shown its works. Till now,
      though her hair could not be described as grey, there was a
      considerable quantity of grey in it: now she examined it
      with an eye that sought for instead of shutting itself to
      such blemish, and the reward of its search was of the most
      meagre sort. There was really no grey left in it: it might
      have been, as far as colour could be taken as a test of
      age, the hair of a young woman. It was not very abundant in
      quantity, but the lotion had held out no promises on that
      score; quality, not quantity, was the sum of its beckoning.
      The application of the skin-food was more expensive: she
      had to use more and it took longer. Nightly she poured a
      can of very hot water into her basin, and with a towel over
      her head to concentrate the vapour, she steamed her face
      over it for some twenty minutes. Emerging red and hot and
      stifled, she wiped off the streams of moisture, and with
      finger-tips dipped in this marvellous cream, tapped and
      dabbed at the less happy regions between her eyebrows,
      outside her eyes, across her forehead, at the corners of
      her mouth, and up and down her neck. Then came the use of
      the palpitating machine; it whirred and buzzed over her,
      tickling very much. For half-an-hour she would make a
      patient piano of her face, then gently remove such of the
      skin-food as still stayed on the surface, and had not gone
      within to do its nurturing work. Certainly this was a
      somewhat laborious affair, but the results were highly
      prosperous. There was no doubt that to a perfectly candid
      and even sceptical eye, a week's treatment had produced a
      change. The wrinkles were beginning to be softly erased:
      there was a perceptible plumpness observable in the leaner
      places. Between the bouts of tapping and dabbing she sipped
      the glass of milk which she brought up to bed with her, as
      the deviser of the skin-food recommended. She drank another
      such glass in the middle of the morning, and digested them
      both perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these external signs appeared and grew there went on
      within her an accompanying and corresponding rejuvenation
      of spirit. She felt very well, owing, no doubt, to the
      brisk air, the milk, the many hours spent out-of-doors, and
      in consequence she began to feel much younger. An unwonted
      activity and lightness pervaded her limbs: she took daily a
      walk of a couple of hours without fatigue, and was the life
      and soul of the dinner-table, whose other occupants were
      her hosts, Mrs. Bertram, a cold, grim woman with a
      moustache, and her husband, milder, with whiskers. Their
      only passion was for gardening, and they seldom left their
      grounds; thus Mrs. Ames took her walks unaccompanied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles of firm sands, when the tide was low, subtended the
      cliffs on which Mr. Bertram's house stood, and often Mrs.
      Ames preferred to walk along the margin of the sea rather
      than pursue more inland routes, and to-day, after her large
      and wholesome lunch (the physical stimulus of the east
      coast, combined with this mental stimulus of her object in
      coming here, gave her an appetite of dimensions unknown at
      Riseborough) she took a maritime way. The tide was far out,
      and the lower sands, still shining and firm from the
      retained moisture of its retreat, made uncommonly pleasant
      walking. She had abandoned heeled footgear, and had bought
      at a shop in the village, where everything inexpensive,
      from wooden spades to stamps and sticking plaster, was
      sold, a pair of canvas coverings technically known as
      sandshoes. They laced up with a piece of white tape, and
      were juvenile, light, and easily removable. They, and the
      great sea, and the jetsam of stranded seaweed, and the
      general sense of youth and freshness, made most agreeable
      companions, and she felt, though neither Mr. nor Mrs.
      Bertram was with her, charmingly accompanied. Her small,
      toadlike face expressed a large degree of contentment, and
      piercing her pleasant surroundings as the smell of syringa
      pierces through the odour of all other flowers, was the
      sense of her brown hair and fast-fading wrinkles. That gave
      her an inward happiness which flushed with pleasure and
      interest all she saw. In the lines of pebbles left by the
      retreating tide was an orange-coloured cornelian, which she
      picked up, and put in her pocket. She could have bought the
      same, ready polished, for a shilling at the cheap and
      comprehensive shop, but to find it herself gave her a
      pleasure not to be estimated at all in terms of silver
      coinage. Further on there was an attractive-looking shell,
      which she also picked up, and was about to give as a
      companion to the cornelian, when a sudden scurry of
      claw-like legs about its aperture showed her that a
      hermit-crab was domiciled within, and she dropped it with a
      little scream and a sense of danger escaped both by her and
      the hermit-crab. There were attractive pieces of seaweed,
      which reminded her of years when she collected the finer
      sorts, and set them, with the aid of a pin, on
      cartridge-paper, spreading out their delicate fronds and
      fern-like foliage. There were creamy ripples of the quiet
      sea, long-winged gulls that hovered fishing; above all
      there was the sense of her brown hair and smoothed face.
      She felt years younger, and she felt she looked years
      younger, which was scarcely less solid a satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleased her, but not acutely or viciously, to think of
      Mrs. Altham's feelings when she made her rejuvenated
      appearance in Riseborough. It was quite certain that Mrs.
      Altham would suspect that she had been "doing something to
      herself," and that Mrs. Altham would burst with envy and
      curiosity to know what it was she had done. Although she
      felt very kindly towards all the world, she did not deceive
      herself to such an extent as to imagine that she would tell
      Mrs. Altham what she had done. Mrs. Altham was ingenious
      and would like guessing. But that lady occupied her mind
      but little. The main point was that in a week from now she
      would go home again, and that Lyndhurst would find her
      young. She might or might not have been right in fearing
      that Lyndhurst was becoming sentimentally interested in
      Millie Evans, and she was quite willing to grant that her
      grounds for that fear were of the slenderest. But all that
      might be dismissed now. She herself, in a week from now,
      would have recaptured that more youthful aspect which had
      been hers while he was still of loverlike inclination
      towards her. What might be called regular good looks had
      always been denied her, but she had once had her share of
      youth. To-day she felt youthful still, and once again, she
      believed, looked as if she belonged to the enchanted epoch.
      She had no intention of using this recapture promiscuously:
      she scarcely desired general admiration: she only desired
      that her husband should find her attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while, as she took her quick, short steps
      along these shining sands, she felt herself grow bitter
      towards Millie Evans. A sort of superior pity was mixed
      with the bitterness, for she told herself that poor Millie,
      if she had tried to flirt with Lyndhurst, would speedily
      find herself flirting all alone. Very likely Millie was
      guiltless in intention; she had only let her pretty face
      produce an unchecked effect. Men were attracted by a pretty
      face, but the owners of such faces ought to keep a curb on
      them, so to speak. Their faces were not their faults, but
      rather their misfortunes. A woman with a pretty face would
      be wise to make herself rather reserved, so that her manner
      would chill anybody who was inclined. . . . But the whole
      subject now was obsolete. If there had been any danger,
      there would not be any more, and she did not blame Millie.
      She must ask Millie to dine with them <i>en famille,</i>
      which was much nicer than <i>en garon,</i> as soon as she
      got back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be gathered from this account of Mrs. Ames'
      self-communings that deep down in her nature there lay a
      strain of almost farcical fatuousness. But she was not
      really fatuous, unless it is fatuous to have preserved far
      out into the plains of middle-age some vision of the blue
      mountains of youth. It is true that for years she had been
      satisfied to dwell on these plains; now, her fear that her
      husband, so much younger than herself, was turning his eyes
      to blue mountains that did not belong to him, made her
      desire to get out of the plains and ascend her own blue
      mountains again and wave to him from there, and encourage
      his advance. She felt exceedingly well, and in consequence
      told herself that in mind, as well as physical
      constitution, she was young still, while the effect of the
      bottles which she used with such regularity made her
      believe that the outward signs of age were erasible. She
      seemed to have been granted a new lease of life in a
      tenement that it was easy to repair. Her whole nature felt
      itself to be quickened and vivified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone far along the sands, and the tide was
      beginning to flow again. All round her were great empty
      spaces, a shipless sea, a cloudless sky, a beach with no
      living being in sight. A sudden unpremeditated impulse
      seized her, and without delay she sat down on the shore,
      and took off her shoes and stockings. Then, pulling up her
      skirts, she hastily ran down to the edge of the water,
      across a little belt of pebbles that tickled and hurt her
      soft-soled feet, and waded out into the liquid rims of the
      sea. She was astonished and amazed at herself that the idea
      of paddling had ever come into her head, and more amazed
      that she had had the temerity to put it into execution. For
      the first minute or two the cold touch of the water on her
      unaccustomed ankles and calves made her gasp a little, but
      for all the strangeness of these sensations she felt that
      paddling, playing like a child in the shallow waters,
      expressed the tone of her mind, just as the melody of a
      song expresses the words to which it is set. If she had had
      a spade, she would certainly have built a sand-castle and
      dug moats about it, and a smile lit up her small face at
      the thought of purchasing one at the universal shop, and
      furtively conveying it to these unfrequented beaches. And
      the smile almost ended in a blush when she tried to imagine
      what Riseborough society would say if it became known that
      their queen not only paddled in the sea, but seriously
      contemplated buying a wooden spade in order to conduct
      building operations on lonely shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paddling, though quite pleasant, was not so joyous as
      the impulse to paddle had been, and it was not long before
      she sat down again on the beach and tried to get the sand
      out of the small, tight places between her toes, and to dry
      her feet and plump little legs with a most exiguous
      handkerchief. But even in the midst of these troublesome
      operations, her mind still ran riot, and she planned to
      secrete about her person one of her smaller bedroom towels
      when she went for her walk next day. And she felt as if
      this act of paddling must have aided in the elimination of
      wrinkles. For who except the really young could want to
      paddle? To find that she had the impulse of the really
      young was even better than to cultivate, though with
      success, the appropriate appearance. All the way home this
      effervescence of spirit was hers, which, though it
      definitely sprang from the effects of the lotion, the
      skin-food and the tonic air, produced in her an illusion
      that was complete. She was certainly ascending her remote
      blue mountains again, and through a clarified air she could
      look over the plains, and see how very flat they had been.
      That must all be changed: there must be more variety and
      gaiety introduced into her days. For years, as she saw now,
      her life had been spent in small, joyless hospitalities, in
      keeping her place as accredited leader of Riseborough's
      socialities, in paying her share towards the expenses of
      the house. They did not laugh much at home: there had
      seemed nothing particular to laugh about, and certainly
      they did not paddle. She was forming no plan for paddling
      there now, irrespective of the fact that a muddy canal,
      which was the only water in the neighbourhood, did not
      encourage the scheme, but there must be introduced into her
      life and Lyndhurst's more of the spirit that had to-day
      prompted her paddling. Exactly what form it should take she
      did not clearly foresee, but when she had recaptured the
      spirit as well as the appearance of youth, there was no
      fear that it would find any difficulty in expressing itself
      suitably. All aglow, especially as to her feet, which
      tingled pleasantly, she arrived at her host's house again.
      They were both at work in the garden: Mrs. Bertram was
      killing slugs in the garden beds, Mr. Bertram worms on the
      lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames proved himself during the next week to be a good
      correspondent, if virtue in correspondents is to be
      measured by the frequency of their communications. His
      letters were not long, but they were cheerful, since the
      garden was coming on well in this delightful weather, which
      he hoped embraced Cromer also, and since he had on two
      separate occasions made a grand slam when playing Bridge at
      the club. He and Harry were jogging along quite pleasantly,
      but there had been no gaieties to take them out, except a
      tea-party with ices at Mrs. Brooks'. Unfortunately, some
      disaster had befallen the ices: personally, he thought it
      was salt instead of sugar, but Harry had been unwell
      afterwards, which suggested sour cream. But his
      indisposition had been but short, though violent. He
      himself had dropped in to dine <i>en garon</i> with the
      Evans', and the doctor was very busy. Finally (this came at
      the end of every letter), as the place was doing her so
      much good, why not stop for another week? He was sure the
      Bertrams (poor things!) would be delighted if she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that suggestion did not commend itself to Mrs. Ames.
      She had come here for a definite purpose, and when on the
      morning before her departure she looked very critically at
      herself in the glass, she felt that her purpose had been
      accomplished. Her skin had not, so much she admitted, the
      unruffled smoothness of a young woman's, but she had not
      been a young woman when she married. But search where she
      might in her hair, there was no sign of greyness in it all,
      while the contents of the bottle were not yet half used.
      But she would take back the more than moiety with her,
      since an occasional application when the hair had resumed
      its usual colour was recommended. It appeared to her that
      it undoubtedly had resumed its original colour: the change,
      though slight (for the grey had never been conspicuous),
      was complete; she felt equipped for youth again. And
      psychologically she felt equipped: every day since the
      first secret paddling she had paddled again in secret, and
      from a crevice in a tumble of fallen rock she daily
      extracted a small wooden spade, by aid of which, with many
      glancings around for fear of possible observers, she dug in
      the sand, making moats and ramparts. The "first fine
      careless rapture" of this, it must be admitted, had
      evaporated: after one architectural afternoon she had dug
      not because this elementary pursuit expressed what she
      felt, so much as because it expressed what she desired to
      feel. After all, she did not propose to rejuvenate herself
      to the extent of being nine or ten years old again. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The manner of her return to Riseborough demanded
      consideration: it was not sufficient merely to look up in a
      railway guide the swiftest mode of transit and adopt it,
      for this was not quite an ordinary entry, and it would
      never do to take the edge off it by making a travel-soiled
      and dusty first appearance. So she laid down a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bare facts about the trains were these. A train
      starting at a convenient hour would bring her to London a
      short half-hour before another convenient train from
      another and distant terminus started for Riseborough. It
      was impossible to make certain of catching this, so she
      wrote to her husband saying that she would in all
      probability get to Riseborough by a later train that
      arrived there at eight. She begged him not to meet her at
      the station, but to order dinner for half-past eight. It
      would be nice to be at home again. Then came the plan.
      Clearly it would never do to burst on him like that, to sit
      down opposite him at the dinner-table beneath the somewhat
      searching electric light there, handicapped by the fatigues
      of a hot journey only imperfectly repaired by a hasty
      toilet. She must arrive by the early train, though not
      expected till the later. Thus she would secure a quiet two
      hours for bathing, resting and dressing. If Lyndhurst did
      not expect her to arrive till eight it was a practical
      certainty that he would be at the club till that hour, and
      walk home in time to welcome her arrival. He would then
      learn that she had already come and was dressing. She would
      be careful to let him go downstairs first, and a minute
      later she would follow. He should see. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      So in order to catch this earlier train from town she left
      Cromer while morning was yet dewy, and had the peculiar
      pleasure, on her arrival at Riseborough, of seeing her
      husband, from the windows of her cab, passing along the
      street to the club. She had a moment's qualm that he would
      see her initialled boxes on the top, but by grace of a
      punctual providence Mrs. Brooks came out of her house at
      the moment, and the Major raised a gallant hat and spoke a
      cheerful word to her. Certainly he looked very handsome and
      distinguished, and Mrs. Ames felt a little tremor of
      anticipation in thinking of the chapters of life that were
      to be re-read by them. She felt confident also; it never
      entered her head to have any misgivings as to what the last
      fortnight, which had contained so much for her, might have
      contained for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had gone back to Cambridge for the July term the day
      before, and she found on her arrival that she had the house
      to herself. The afternoon had turned a little chilly, and
      she enjoyed the invigoration of a hot bath, and a
      subsequent hour's rest on her sofa. Then it was time to
      dress, and though the dinner was of the simplest conjugal
      character, she put on a dress she had worn but some
      half-dozen of times before, but which on this one occasion
      it was meet should descend from the pompous existence that
      was its destiny for a year or two to come. It was of daring
      rose-colour, the most resplendent possible, and never
      failed to create an impression. Indeed, she had, on one of
      its infrequent appearances, heard Lyndhurst say to his
      neighbour in an undertone, "Upon my soul, Amy looks very
      well to-night." And Amy meant to look very well again.
    </p>
    <p>
      All happened as she had planned. Shortly after eight
      Lyndhurst tapped at her door on his return from the club,
      but could not be admitted, and at half-past, having heard
      him go downstairs, she followed him. He had not dressed,
      according to their custom when they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames was writing a note when she entered, and only
      turned round in his chair, not getting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to see you home, my dear," he said. "Excuse me one
      moment. I must just direct this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him and waited while he scrawled an address.
      Then he got up and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just in time to catch the post," he said. "By Jove! Amy,
      you've put on the famous pink gown. I would have dressed if
      I had known. You're tired with your journey, I expect. It
      was a very hot day here, until a couple of hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the note to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And dinner's ready, I think," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down opposite each other at ends of the rather
      long table. There were no flowers on it, for it had not
      occurred to him to get the garden to welcome her
      home-coming, and the whole of her resplendency was visible
      to him. He began eating his soup vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital plan in summer to have dinner at half-past eight,"
      he said. "Gives one most of the daylight and not so long an
      evening afterwards. Excellent pea-soup, this. Fresh peas
      from my garden. The Evans' dine at eight-thirty. And how
      have you been, Amy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some indefinable chill of misgiving, against which she
      struggled, had laid cold fingers on her. Things were not
      going any longer as she had planned them. He had noticed
      her gown, but he had noticed nothing else. But then he had
      scarcely looked up since they had come into the
      dining-room. But now he finished his soup, and she
      challenged his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been very well indeed," she said. "Don't I look
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked her straight in the face, saw all that had seemed
      almost a miracle to her--the softened wrinkles, the
      recovered colour of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think you do," he said. "You've got a bit tanned
      too, haven't you, with the sun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold fingers closed a little more tightly on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I?" she said. "That is very likely. I was
      out-of-doors all day. I used to take quite long walks every
      afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the menu-card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you'll like the dinner I ordered you," he said.
      "Your cook and I had a great talk over it this morning.
      'She'll have been in the train all day,' I said, 'and will
      feel a little tired. Appetite will want a bit of tempting,
      eh?' So we settled on a grilled sole, and a chicken and a
      macdoine of fruit. Hope that suits you, Amy. So you used
      to take long walks, did you? Is the country pretty round
      about? Bathing, too. Is it a good coast for bathing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he looked at her as he spoke, and for the moment her
      heart-beat quickened, for it seemed that he could not but
      see the change in her. Then his sole required dissection,
      and he looked at his plate again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it is a good coast," she said. "There were a
      quantity of bathing-machines. I did not bathe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Very wise, I am sure. One has to be careful about
      chills as one gets on. I should have been anxious about
      you, Amy, if I had thought you would be so rash as to
      bathe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some instinct of protest prompted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There would have been nothing to be anxious about," she
      said. "I seldom catch a chill. And I often paddled."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his knife and fork and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You paddled!" he asked. "Nonsense, nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not meant to tell him, for her reasonable mind had
      informed her all the time that this was a secret expression
      of the rejuvenation she was conscious of. But it had
      slipped out, a thoughtless assertion of the youthfulness
      she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did indeed," she said, "and I found it very bracing and
      invigorating."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for a moment a certain bitterness welled up within
      her, born from disappointment at his imperceptiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see I never suffer from gout or rheumatism like you,
      Lyndhurst," she said. "I hope you have been quite free from
      them since I have been away."
    </p>
    <p>
      But his amusement, though it had produced this spirit of
      rancour in her, had not been in the least unkindly. It was
      legitimate to find entertainment in the thought of a
      middle-aged woman gravely paddling, so long as he had no
      idea that there was a most pathetic side to it. Of that he
      had no inkling: he was unaware that this paddling was
      expressive of her feeling of recaptured youth, just as he
      was unaware that she believed it to be expressed in her
      face and hair. But this remark was distinctly of the nature
      of an attack: she was retaliating for his laughter. He
      could not resist one further answer which might both soothe
      and smart (like a patent ointment) before he changed the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, I'm sure you are a wonderful woman for your
      years," he said. "By Jove! I shall be proud if I'm as
      active and healthy as you in ten years' time."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was soon over after this, and she left him, as
      usual, to have his cigarette and glass of port, and went
      into the drawing-room, and stood looking on the last fading
      splendour of the sunset in the west. The momentary
      bitterness in her mind had quite died down again: there was
      nothing left but a vague, dull ache of flatness and
      disappointment. He had noticed nothing of all that had
      caused her such tremulous and secret joy. He had looked on
      her smoothed and softened face, and seen no difference
      there, on her brown unfaded hair and found it unaltered. He
      had only seen that she had put her best gown on, and she
      almost wished that he had not noticed that, since then she
      might have had the consolation of thinking that he was ill.
      It was not, it must be premised, that she meant she would
      find pleasure in his indisposition, only that an
      indisposition would have explained his imperceptiveness,
      which she regretted more than she would have regretted a
      slight headache for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes she was incapable of more than blank and
      empty contemplation of the utter failure of that from which
      she had expected so much. Then, like the stars that even
      now were beginning to be lit in the empty spaces of the
      sky, fresh points in the dreary situation claimed her
      attention. Was he preoccupied with other matters, that he
      was blind to her? His letters, it is true, had been
      uniformly cheerful and chatty, but a preoccupied man can
      easily write a letter without betraying the preoccupation
      that is only too evident in personal intercourse. If this
      was so, what was the nature of his preoccupation? That was
      not a cheerful star: there was a green light in it. . . .
      Another star claimed her attention. Was it Lyndhurst who
      was blind, or herself who saw too much? She had no idea,
      till she came to look into the matter closely, how much
      grey hair was mingled with the brown. Perhaps he had no
      idea either: its restoration, therefore, would not be an
      affair of surprise and admiration. But the wrinkles. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      She faced round from the window as he entered, and made
      another call on her courage and conviction. Though he saw
      so little, she, quickened perhaps by the light of the green
      star, saw how good-looking he was. For years she had
      scarcely noticed it. She put up her small face to him in a
      way that suggested, though it did not exactly invite a
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so nice to be home again," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion that she meant to convey occurred to him,
      but, very reasonably, he dismissed it as improbable. A
      promiscuous caress was a thing long obsolete between them.
      Morning and evening he brushed her cheek with the end of
      his moustaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, we're all pleased," he said good-humouredly.
      "Shall I ring for coffee, Amy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," she said, "and when we have had coffee, will you
      fetch a shawl for me, and we will stroll in the garden. You
      shall show me what new flowers have come out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The intention of that was admirable, the actual proposal
      not so happy, since a glimmering starlight through the
      fallen dusk would not conduce to a perception of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll stroll in the garden by all means," he said, "if you
      think it will not be risky for you. But as to flowers, my
      dear, it will be easier to appreciate them when it is not
      dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she put up her face towards him. This time he might,
      perhaps, have taken the suggestion, but at the moment
      Parker entered with the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How foolish of me," she said. "I forgot it was dark. But
      let us go out anyhow, unless you were thinking of going
      round to the club."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, time for that, time for that," said he. "I expect you
      will be going to bed early after your long journey. I may
      step round then, and see what's going on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without conscious encouragement or welcome on her part, a
      suspicion darted into her mind. She felt by some process,
      as inexplicable as that by which certain people are aware
      of the presence of a cat in the room, that he was going
      round to see Mrs. Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have often gone round to the club in the
      evening since I have been away," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have looked in now and again," he said. "On other
      evenings I have dropped in to see our friends. Lonely old
      bachelor, you know, and Harry was not always very lively
      company. It's a good thing that boy has gone back to
      Cambridge, Amy. He was always mooning round after Mrs.
      Evans."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a fact: it had often been a slightly inconvenient
      one. Several times the Major had "dropped in" to see
      Millie, and found his son already there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you were rather pleased at that, Lyndhurst,"
      she said. "You told me you considered it not a bad thing:
      that it would keep Harry out of mischief."
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his coffee rather hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, within reason, within reason," he said. "Well, if we
      are to stroll in the garden, we had better go out. You
      wanted a shawl, didn't you? Very wise: where shall I find
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That diverted her again to her own personal efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are several in the second tray of my wardrobe," she
      said. "Choose a nice one, Lyndhurst, something that won't
      look hideous with my pink silk."
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile, as you might almost say, of coquetry, which
      accompanied this speech, faded completely as soon as he
      left the room, and her face assumed that business-like
      aspect, which the softest and youngest faces wear, when the
      object is to attract, instead of letting a mutual
      attraction exercise its inevitable power. Even though Mrs.
      Ames' object was the legitimate and laudable desire to
      attract her own husband, it was strange how common her
      respectable little countenance appeared. She had adorned
      herself to attract admiration: coquetry and anxiety were
      pitifully mingled, even as you may see them in haunts far
      less respectable than this detached villa, and on faces
      from which Mrs. Ames would instantly have averted her own.
      She hoped he would bring a certain white silk shawl: two
      nights ago she had worn it on the verandah after dinner at
      Overstrand, and the reflected light from it, she had
      noticed, as she stood beneath a light opposite a mirror in
      the hall, had made her throat look especially soft and
      plump. She stood underneath the light now waiting for his
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune was favourable: it was that shawl that he brought,
      and she turned round for him to put it on her shoulders.
      Then she faced him again in the remembered position,
      underneath the light, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I am ready, Lyndhurst," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the French window for her, and stood to let her
      pass out. Again she smiled at him, and waited for him to
      join her on the rather narrow gravel path. There was
      actually room for two abreast on it, for, on the evening of
      her dinner-party, Harry had walked here side by side with
      Mrs. Evans. But there was only just room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go first, Amy," he said, "or shall I? We can scarcely
      walk abreast here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she took his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, my dear," she said. "There: is there not heaps
      of room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt vaguely uncomfortable. It was not only the
      necessity of putting his feet down one strictly in front of
      the other that made him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything the matter, my dear?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was not cruel: it was scarcely even careless.
      He could hardly be expected to guess, for his perceptions
      were not fine. Also he was thinking about somebody else,
      and wondering how late it was. But even if he had had
      complete knowledge of the situation about which he was
      completely ignorant, he could not have dealt with it in a
      more peremptory way. The dreary flatness to which she had
      been so impassive a prey directly after dinner, the sense
      of complete failure enveloped her like impenetrable fog.
      Out of that fog, she hooted, so to speak, like an
      undervitalized siren.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only so glad to get back," she said, pressing his arm
      a little. "I hoped you were glad, too, that I was back.
      Tell me what you have been doing all the time I have been
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      This, like banns, was for the third time of asking. He
      recalled for her the days one by one, leaving out certain
      parts of them. Even at the moment, he was astonished to
      find how vivid his recollection of them was. On Thursday,
      when he had played golf in the morning, he had lunched with
      the Evans' (this he stated, for Harry had lunched there
      too) and he had culled probably the last dish of asparagus
      in the afternoon. He had dined alone with Harry that night,
      and Harry had toothache. Next day, consequently, Harry went
      to the dentist in the morning, and he himself had played
      golf in the afternoon. That he remembered because he had
      gone to tea with Mrs. Evans afterwards, but that he did not
      mention, for he had been alone with her, and they had
      talked about being misunderstood and about affinities. On
      Saturday Harry had gone back to Cambridge, but, having
      missed his train, he had made a second start after lunch.
      He had met Dr. Evans in the street that day, going up to
      the golf links, and since he would otherwise be quite alone
      in the evening, he had dined with them, "<i>en garon</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      This catalogue of trivial happenings took quite a long time
      in the recitation. But below the trivialities there was a
      lurking significance. He was not really in love with Millie
      Evans, and his assurance to himself on that point was
      perfectly honest. But (this he did not put so distinctly to
      himself) he thought that she was tremendously attracted by
      him. Here was an appeal to a sort of deplorable sense of
      gallantry--so terrible a word only can describe his
      terrible mind--and mentally he called her "poor little
      lady." She was pretty, too, and not very happy. It seemed
      to be incumbent on him to interest and amuse her. His
      "droppings in" amused her: when he got ready to drop out
      again, she always asked when he would come to see her next.
      These "droppings in" were clearly bright spots to her in a
      drab day. They were also bright spots to him, for he was
      more interested in them than in all his sweet-peas. There
      was a "situation" come into his life, something
      clandestine. It would never do, for instance, to let Amy or
      the estimable doctor get a hint of it. Probably they would
      misunderstand it, and imagine there was something to
      conceal. He had the secret joys of a bloodless intrigue.
      But, considering its absolute bloodlessness, he was
      amazingly wrapped up in it. It was no wonder that he did
      not notice the restored colour of Amy's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, or rather Mrs. Evans, had made a conditional
      appointment for to-night. If possible, the possibility
      depending upon Amy's fatigue, he was going to drop in for a
      chat. Primarily the chat was to be concerned with the
      lighting of the garden by means of Chinese lanterns, for a
      nocturnal fte that Mrs. Evans meant to give on her
      birthday. The whole garden was to be lit, and since the
      entertainment of an illuminated garden, with hot soup,
      quails and ices, under the mulberry-tree was obviously new
      to Riseborough, it would be sufficiently amusing to the
      guests to walk about the garden till supper-time. But there
      would be supererogatory diversions beyond that,
      bridge-tables in the verandah, a small band at the end of
      the garden to intervene its strains between the guests and
      the shrieks of South-Eastern expresses, and already there
      was an idea of fancy dress. Major Ames favoured the idea of
      fancy dress, for he had a red velvet garment, sartorially
      known as a Venetian cloak, locked away upstairs, which was
      a dazzling affair if white tights peeped out from below it.
      He knew he had a leg, and only lamented the scanty
      opportunities of convincing others of the fact. But the
      lighting of the garden had to be planned first: there was
      no use in having a leg in a garden, if the garden was not
      properly lit. But the whole affair was as yet a pledged
      secret: he could not, as a man of honour, tell Amy about
      it. Short notice for a fte of this sort was of no
      consequence, for it was to be a post-prandial
      entertainment, and the only post-prandial entertainment at
      present existent in Riseborough was going to bed. Thus
      everybody would be able to be happy to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rapid <i>rsum</i> of this made an undercurrent in his
      mind, as he went through, in speaking voice, the history of
      the last days. Up and down the narrow path they passed, she
      still with her hand in his arm, questioning, showing an
      inconceivable interest in the passage of the days from
      which he had left out all real points of interest. His
      patience came to an end before hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, my dear," he said, "it's getting a little
      chilly. Shall we go in, do you think? I'm sure you are
      tired with your journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more coming: she knew that. But even in
      the midst of her disappointment, she found consolation.
      Daylight would show the re-establishment of her
      youthfulness more clearly than electric light had done.
      Every one looked about the same by electric light. And
      though, in some secret manner, she distrusted his visit to
      the club, she knew how impolitic it would be to hint,
      however remotely, at such distrust. It was much better this
      evening to acquiesce in the imputation of fatigue. Nor was
      the imputation groundless; for failure fatigues any one
      when under the same conditions success would only
      stimulate. And in the consciousness of that, her bitterness
      rose once more to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't catch cold," she said. "Let us go in."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still only half-past ten: all this flatness and
      failure had lasted but a couple of hours, and Major Ames,
      as soon as his wife had gone upstairs, let himself out of
      the house. His way lay past the doors of the club, but he
      did not enter, merely observing through its lit windows
      that there were a good many men in the smoking-room. On
      arrival at the Doctor's he found that Elsie and her father
      were playing chess in the drawing-room, and that Mrs. Evans
      was out in the garden. He chose to go straight into the
      garden, and found her sitting under the mulberry, dressed
      in white, and looking rather like the Milky Way. She did
      not get up, but held out her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is nice of you," she said. "How is Cousin Amy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amy is very well," said he. "But she's gone to bed early,
      a little tired with the journey. And how is Cousin Amy's
      cousin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the basket chair close beside her which
      creaked with his weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have a special chair made for you," she said. "You
      are so big and strong. Have you seen Cousin Amy's cousin's
      husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I heard you were out here. So I came straight out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it will be better, then, if we go in, and tell him
      you are here," she said. "He might think it strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames jumped up with alacrity: with his alacrity was
      mingled a pleasing sense of adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means," he said. "Then we can come out again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely. He is playing chess with Elsie. I do not suppose
      he will interrupt his game."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Dr. Evans did not think anything in the least
      strange. On the whole, this was not to be wondered at,
      since he knew quite well that Major Ames was coming to talk
      over garden illumination with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, Major," he said; "kind of you to come. You
      and my little woman are going to make a pauper of me, I'm
      told. There, Elsie, what do you say to my putting my knight
      there? Check."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pig!" said Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then shall we go out, Major Ames?" said Millie. "Are you
      coming out, Wilfred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, little woman. I'm going to defeat your daughter
      indoors. Come and have a glass of whisky and soda with me
      before you go, Major."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out again accordingly into the cool starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilfred is so fond of chess," she said. "He plays every
      night with Elsie, when he is at home. Of course, he is
      often out."
    </p>
    <p>
      This produced exactly the effect that she meant. She did
      not comment or complain: she merely made a statement which
      arose naturally from what was going on in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Major Ames drew the inference that he was expected to
      draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad I could come round," he said. "Now for the lanterns.
      We must have them all down the garden wall, and not too far
      apart, either. Six feet apart, eh? Now I'll step the wall
      and we can calculate how many we shall want there. I think
      I step a full yard still. Not cramped in the joints yet."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It took some half hour to settle the whole scheme of
      lighting, which, since Major Ames was not going to pay for
      it, he recommended being done in a somewhat lavish manner.
      With so large a number of lanterns, it would be easily
      possible to see his leg, and he was strong on the subject
      of fancy dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be some queer turn-outs, I shouldn't wonder," he
      said; "but I expect there will be some creditable costumes
      too. By Jove! it will be quite the event of the year. Amy
      and I, with our little dinners, will have to take a back
      seat, as they say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope Cousin Amy won't think it forward of me," said
      Millie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames said that which is written "Pshaw." "Forward?"
      he cried. "Why, you are bringing a bit of life among us.
      Upon my word, we wanted rousing up a bit. Why, you are a
      public benefactor."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had sat down to rest again after their labour of
      stepping out the brick walls under the mulberry-tree, where
      the grass was dry, and only a faint shimmer of starlight
      came through the leaves. At the bottom of the garden a
      train shrieked by, and the noise died away in decrescent
      thunder. She leaned forward a little towards him, putting
      up her face much as Amy had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if only I thought I was making things a little
      pleasant," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it struck Major Ames that he was expected to kiss
      her. He leaned forward, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you know that," he said. "I wish I could thank you
      for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move, but in the dusk he could see she was
      smiling at him. It looked as if she was waiting. He made an
      awkward forward movement and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence a moment: she neither responded to him
      nor repelled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose people would say I ought not to have let you,"
      she said. "But there is no harm, is there? After all, you
      are a--a sort of cousin. And you have been so kind about
      the lanterns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames was thinking almost entirely about himself,
      hardly at all about her. An adventure, an intrigue had
      begun. He had kissed somebody else's wife and felt the
      devil of a fellow. But with the wine of this emotion was
      mingled a touch of alarm. It would be wise to call a halt,
      take his whisky and soda with her husband, and get home to
      Amy.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham waited with considerable impatience next day
      for the return of her husband from the club, where he went
      on most afternoons, to sit in an armchair from tea-time to
      dinner and casually to learn what had happened while he had
      been playing golf. She had been to call on Mrs. Ames in the
      afternoon, and in consequence had matter of considerable
      importance to communicate. She could have supported that
      retarded spate of information, though she wanted to burst
      as soon as possible, but she had also a question to ask
      Henry on which a tremendous deal depended. At length she
      heard the rattle of his deposited hat and stick in the
      hall, and she went out to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How late you are, Henry," she said; "but you needn't
      dress. Mrs. Brooks, if she does come in afterwards, will
      excuse you. Dinner is ready: let us come in at once. Now,
      you were at the club last night, after dinner. You told me
      who was there; but I want to be quite sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham closed his eyes for a moment as he sat down. It
      looked as if he was saying a silent grace, but appearances
      were deceptive. He was only thinking, for he knew his wife
      would not ask such a question unless something depended on
      it, and he desired to be accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he opened them again, and helped the soup with a name
      to each spoonful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "General Fortescue," he said. "Young Morton. Mr. Taverner,
      Turner, Young Turner."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was five spoonfuls--three for his wife, two for
      himself. He was not very fond of soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you were there all the time between ten and eleven?"
      asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till half-past eleven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there was no one else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham looked up brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The club waiter," he said, "and the page. The page has
      been dismissed for stealing sugar. The sugar bill was
      preposterous. That was how we found out. Did you mean to
      ask about that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear. Nor do I want to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment the parlour-maid left the room, and she spoke
      in an eager undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Ames told me that Major Ames went up to the club last
      night, when she went to bed at half-past ten," she said.
      "You told me at breakfast whom you found there, but I
      wanted to be sure. Call them Mr. and Mrs. Smith and then we
      can go on talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlour-maid came back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Smith apparently went up to the club at half-past
      ten," she said. "But he can't have gone to the club, for in
      that case you would have seen him. It has occurred to me
      that he didn't feel well, and went to the doctor's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems possible," said Mr. Altham, not without
      enthusiasm, understanding that "doctor" meant "doctor," and
      which doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have all noticed how many visits he has been paying
      to--to Dr. Jones," said Mrs. Altham, "during the time Mrs.
      Smith was away. But to pay another one on the very evening
      of her return looks as if--as if something serious was the
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, there's nothing whatever to show that Major Ames
      went to the doctor's last night," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham gave him an awful glance, for the parlour-maid
      was in the room, and this thoughtless remark rendered all
      the diplomatic substitution of another nomenclature
      entirely void and useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Smith, I should say," added Mr. Altham in some
      confusion, proceeding to make it all quite clear to Jane,
      in case she had any doubts about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suggest to me any other reasonable theory as to where he
      was, then," said Mrs. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't suggest where he was, my dear," said Mr. Altham,
      finding his legal training supported him, "considering that
      there is no evidence of any kind that bears upon the
      matter. But to know that a man was not in one given place
      does not show with any positiveness that he was at any
      other given place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, then, he went shopping at half-past ten last
      night," said Mrs. Altham, with deep sarcasm. "There are so
      many shops open then. The High Street is a perfect blaze of
      light."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham could be sarcastic, too, though he seldom
      exercised this gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It quite dazzles one," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham no doubt was vexed at her husband's sceptical
      attitude, and she punished him by refraining from
      discussing the point any further, and from giving him the
      rest of her news. But this severity punished herself also,
      for she was bursting to tell him. When Jane had finally
      withdrawn, the internal pressure became irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Ames has done something to her hair, Henry," she
      said; "and she has done something to her face. I had a good
      mind to ask her what she had used. I assure you there was
      not a grey hair left anywhere, and a fortnight ago she was
      as grey as a coot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coots are bald, not grey," remarked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is mere carping, Henry. She is brown now. Is this
      another fashion she is going to set us at Riseborough? What
      does it all mean? Shall we all have to plaster our faces
      with cold cream, and dye our hair blue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham was in a painfully literal mood this evening and
      could not disentangle information from rhetoric.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she dyed her hair blue?" he asked in a slightly
      awestricken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear: how can you be so stupid? And I told you just
      now she was brown. But at her age! As if anybody cared what
      colour her hair was. Her face, too! I don't deny that the
      wrinkles are less marked, but who cares whether she is
      wrinkled or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      These pleasant considerations were discontinued by the
      sound of the postman's tap on the front door, and since the
      postman took precedence of everybody and everything, Mr.
      Altham hurried out to see what excitements he had piloted
      into port. Unfortunately, there was nothing for him, but
      there was a large, promising-looking envelope for his wife.
      It was stiff, too, and looked like the receptacle of an
      invitation card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One for you, my dear," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham tore it open, and gave a great gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not guess in a hundred tries," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then be so kind as to tell me," remarked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham read it out all in one breath without stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Evans at home Thursday July 20 10 p.m. Shakespeare
      Fancy Dress well I never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while the silence of stupefaction reigned.
      Then Mr. Altham gave a great sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never been to a fancy dress ball," he said. "I
      think I should feel very queer and uncomfortable. What are
      we meant to do when we get there, Julia? Just stand about
      and look at each other. It will seem very strange. What
      would you recommend me to be? I suppose we ought to be a
      pair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham, to do her justice, had not thought seriously
      about her personal appearance for years. But, as she got up
      from the table, and consciously faced the looking-glass
      over the chimney-piece, it is idle to deny that she
      considered it now. She was not within ten years of Mrs.
      Ames' age, and it struck her, as she carefully regarded
      herself in a perfectly honest glass, that even taking into
      full consideration all that Mrs. Ames had been doing to her
      hair and her face, she herself still kept the proper
      measure of their difference of years between them. But it
      was yet too early to consider the question of her
      impersonation. There were other things suggested by the
      contemplation of a fancy-dress ball to be considered first.
      There was so much, in fact, that she hardly knew where to
      begin. So she whisked everything up together, in the manner
      of a sea-pie, in which all that is possibly edible is put
      in the oven and baked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be time enough to talk over that, my dear," she
      said, "for if Mrs. Evans thinks we are all going to lash
      out into no end of expense in getting dresses for her
      party, she is wrong as far as I, for one, am concerned. For
      that matter you can put on your oldest clothes, and I can
      borrow Jane's apron and cap, and we can go as Darby and
      Joan. Indeed, I do not know if I shall go at all--though,
      of course, one wouldn't like to hurt Mrs. Evans' feelings
      by refusing. Do you know, Henry, I shouldn't in the least
      wonder if we have seen the last of Mrs. Ames and all her
      airs of superiority and leadership. You may depend upon it
      that Mrs. Evans did not consult her before she settled to
      give a fancy dress party. It is far more likely that she
      and Major Ames contrived it all between them, while Mrs.
      Ames was away, and settled what they should go as, and I
      daresay it will be Romeo and Juliet. I should not be in the
      least surprised if Mrs. Ames did not go to the party at
      all, but tried to get something up on her own account that
      very night. It would be like her, I am sure. But whether
      she goes or not, it seems to me that we have seen the last
      of her queening it over us all. If she does not go, I
      should think she would be the only absentee, and if she
      does, she goes as Mrs. Evans' guest. All these years she
      has never thought of a fancy dress party--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham broke off in the middle of her address, stung
      by the splendour of a sudden thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or does all this staying away on her part," she said, "and
      dyeing her hair, and painting her face, mean that she knew
      about it all along, and was going to be the show-figure of
      it all? I should not wonder if that was it. As likely as
      not, she and Major Ames will come as Hamlet and Ophelia, or
      something equally ridiculous, though I am sure as far as
      the 'too too solid flesh' goes, Major Ames would make an
      admirable Hamlet, for I never saw a man put on weight in
      the manner he does, in spite of all the garden rolling,
      which I expect the gardener does for him really. But
      whatever is the truth of it all, and I'm sure every one is
      so secretive here in Riseborough nowadays, that you never
      know how many dined at such a place on such a night unless
      you actually go to the poulterer's and find out whether one
      chicken or two was sent,--what was I saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been saying a good deal. Mr. Altham correctly
      guessed the train of thought which she desired to recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of the secretiveness--" he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      That served the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear Henry," said his wife rapidly, "I accuse no
      one of secretiveness: if I did, you misunderstood me. All I
      meant was that when we have settled what we are to go as,
      we will tell nobody. There is very little sense in a fancy
      dress entertainment if you know exactly what you may
      expect, and as soon as you see a Romeo can say for certain
      that it is Major Ames, for instance; and I'm sure if he is
      to go as Romeo, it would be vastly suitable if Mrs. Ames
      went as Juliet's nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure that I shall like so much finery," said Mr.
      Altham, who was thinking entirely about his own dress, and
      did not care two straws about Major or Mrs. Ames. "It will
      seem very strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, my dear; we will dine in our fancy dresses for
      an evening or two before, and you will get quite used to
      it, whatever it is. Henry, do you remember my white satin
      gown, which I scarcely wore a dozen times, because it
      seemed too grand for Riseborough? It was too, I am sure:
      you were quite right. It has been in camphor ever since. I
      used to wear my Roman pearls with it. There are three rows,
      and the clasp is of real pearls. The very thing for
      Cleopatra."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recollect perfectly," said Mr. Altham. His mind
      instantly darted off again to the undoubted fact that
      whereas Major Ames was stout, he himself was very thin. If
      he had been obliged to describe his figure at that moment,
      he would have said it was boyish. The expense of a wig
      seemed of no account.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, white dress and pearls," said his wife.
      "You are not very encouraging. With that book of Egyptian
      antiquities, I can easily remodel the dress. And I remember
      reading in a Roman history that Cleopatra was well over
      thirty when Julius Csar was so devoted to her. And by the
      busts he must have been much balder than you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no use denying that this was a rather heavy blow.
      Ever since the mention of the word Cleopatra, he had seen
      himself complete, with a wig, in another character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Julius Csar was sixty," he observed, with pardonable
      asperity. "I do not see how I could make up as a man of
      sixty. And for that matter, my dear, though I am sure no
      one would think you were within five years of your actual
      age, I do not see how you could make up as a mere girl of
      thirty. Why should we not go as 'Antony and Cleopatra, ten
      years later'? It would be better than to go as Julius Csar
      arid Cleopatra ten years before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham considered this. It was true that she would
      find it difficult to look thirty, however many Roman pearls
      she wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know that it is such a bad idea of yours, Henry,"
      she said. "Certainly there is no one in the world who cares
      about her age, or wants to conceal it, less than I. And
      there is something original about your suggestion--Antony
      and Cleopatra ten years later--Ah, there is the bell, that
      will be Mrs. Brooks coming in. And there is the telephone
      also. Upon my word, we never have a moment to ourselves. I
      should not wonder if half Riseborough came to see us
      to-night. Will you go to the telephone and tell it we are
      at home? And not a word to anybody, Henry, as to what we
      are thinking of going as. There will be our surprise, at
      any rate, however much other people go talking about their
      dresses. If you are being rung up to ask about your
      costume, say that you haven't given it a thought yet."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For the next week Mrs. Altham was thoroughly in her
      element. She had something to conceal, and was in a
      delicious state of tension with the superficial desire to
      disclose her own impersonation, and the deep-rooted
      satisfaction of not doing so. To complete her happiness,
      the famous white satin still fitted her, and she was nearly
      insane with curiosity to know what Major and Mrs. Ames
      "were going to be," and what the whole history of the
      projected festivity was. In various other respects her
      natural interest in the affairs of other people was
      satiated. Mrs. Turner was to be Mistress Page, which was
      very suitable, as she was elderly and stout, and did not
      really in the least resemble Miss Ellen Terry. Mr. Turner
      had selected Falstaff, and could be recognized anywhere.
      Young Morton, with unwonted modesty, had chosen the part of
      the Apothecary in Romeo and Juliet. Mrs. Taverner was to be
      Queen Catherine, and--almost more joyous than all--she had
      persuaded Mrs. Brooks not to attempt to impersonate
      Cleopatra. What Mrs. Brooks' feelings would be when it
      dawned on her, as it not inconceivably might, that Mrs.
      Altham had seen in her a striking likeness to her
      conception of Hermione, because she did not want there to
      be two Cleopatras, did not particularly concern her. She
      had asked Mrs. Brooks to dinner the day after the
      entertainment, and her acceptance would bury the hatchet,
      if indeed there was such a thing as a hatchet about.
      Finally, she had called on Mrs. Evans, who had vaguely
      talked about Midsummer Night's Dream. Mrs. Altham had taken
      that to be equivalent to the fact that she would appear as
      Titania, and Mrs. Evans had distinctly intended that she
      should so take it. Indeed, the idea had occurred to her,
      but not very vividly. Her husband was going to be Timon of
      Athens. That, again, was quite satisfactory: nobody knew at
      all distinctly who Timon of Athens was, and nobody knew
      much about Dr. Evans, except that he was usually sent for
      in the middle of something. Probably the same thing
      happened to Timon of Athens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, within a couple of hours of the reception of Mrs.
      Evans' invitations, which all arrived simultaneously by the
      local evening post, a spirit of demoniacal gaiety, not less
      fierce than that which inspired Mrs. Altham, possessed the
      whole of those invited. Though it was gay, it was certainly
      demoniacal, for a quite prodigious amount of ill-feeling
      was mingled with it which from time to time threatened to
      wreck the proceedings altogether. For instance, only two
      days after all the invitations had been accepted, Mrs.
      Evans had issued a further intimation that there was to be
      dancing, and that the evening would open at a quarter past
      ten precisely with a quadrille in which it was requested
      that everybody would take part. It is easy to picture the
      private consternation that presided over that evening; how
      in one house, Mrs. Brooks having pushed her central
      drawing-room table to one side, all alone and humming to
      herself, stepped in perplexed and forgotten measures, and
      how next door Mrs. and Mr. Altham violently wrangled over
      the order of the figures, and hummed different tunes, to
      show each other, or pranced in different directions. For
      here was the bitter affair: these pains had to be suffered
      in loneliness, for it was clearly impossible to confess
      that the practice of quadrilles was so long past that the
      memory of them had vanished altogether. But luckily (though
      at the moment the suggestion caused a great deal of
      asperity in Mrs. Altham's mind) Mrs. Ames came to the
      rescue with the suggestion that as many of them, no doubt,
      had forgotten the precise manner of quadrilles, she
      proposed to hold a class at half-past four to-morrow
      afternoon, when they would all run through a quadrille
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! I thought as much!" said Mrs. Altham. "That means
      that neither Major nor Mrs. Ames can remember how the
      quadrille goes, and we, forsooth, must go and teach them.
      And she puts it that she is going to teach us! I am sure
      she will never teach me: I shall not go near the house. I
      do not require to be taught quadrilles by anybody, still
      less by Mrs. Ames. There is no answer," she added to Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham fidgeted in his chair. Last night he had been
      quite sure he was right, in points where he and his wife
      differed, and that the particular "setting partners" which
      they had shown each other so often did not come in the
      quadrille at all, but occurred in lancers, just before the
      ladies' chain. But she had insisted that both the setting
      to partners and ladies' chain came in quadrilles. This
      morning, however, he did not feel quite so certain about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might send a note to Mrs. Ames," he observed, "and
      tell her you are not coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No answer was asked for," said his wife excitedly. "She
      just said there was to be a quadrille practice at half-past
      four. Let there be. I am sure I have no objection, though I
      do think you might have thought of doing it first, Henry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she will like to know how many to expect," said Henry.
      "If it is to be at half-past four, she must be prepared for
      tea. It is equivalent to a tea-party, unless you suppose
      that the class will be over before five."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night Mrs. Altham had pondered her view about
      the ladies' chain. It would be an awful thing if Henry
      happened to be right, and if, on the evening of the dance
      itself, she presented her hand for the ladies' chain, and
      no chain of any sort followed. She decided on a magnanimous
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, I am not sure that I shall not go," she
      said, "just to see what Mrs. Ames' idea of a quadrille is.
      I should not wonder if she mixed it up with something quite
      different, which would be laughable. And after all, we
      ought not to be so unkind, and if poor Mrs. Ames feels she
      will get into difficulties over the quadrille, I am sure I
      shall be happy to help her out. No doubt she has summoned
      us like this, so that she need not show that she feels she
      wants to be helped. We will go, Henry, and I daresay I
      shall get out of her what she means to dress up as! But
      pray remember to say that we, at any rate, have not given a
      thought to our costumes yet. And on our way, we may as well
      call in at Mr. Roland's, for if I am to wear my three rows
      of pearls, he must get me a few more, since I find there is
      a good deal of string showing. I daresay that ordinary
      pearl beads would answer the purpose perfectly. I have no
      intention of buying more of the real Roman pearls. They
      belonged to my mother, and I should not like to add to
      them. And if you will insist on having some red stone in
      your cap, to make a buckle for the feather, I am sure you
      could not do better than get a piece of what he called
      German ruby that is in his shop now. I do not suppose
      anybody in Riseborough could tell it from real, and after
      all this is over, I would wear it as a pendant for my
      pearls. If you wish, I will pay half of it, and it is but a
      couple of pounds altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem a really handsome offer, but Henry had the
      sense to accept it. He wanted a stone to buckle the feather
      in a rather coquettish cap that they had decided to be
      suitable for Mark Antony, and did not really care what
      happened to it after he had worn it on this occasion, since
      it was unlikely that another similar occasion would arise.
      Deep in his mind had been an idea of turning it into a
      solitaire, but he knew he would not have the practical
      courage of this daring conception. It would want another
      setting, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other houses there were no fewer anticipatory triumphs
      and present perplexities. There was also, in some cases,
      wild and secret intrigue. For instance, a few evenings
      after, Mrs. Brooks next door, sorting out garments in her
      wardrobe from which she might devise a costume that should
      remind the beholder of Hermione, looked from her bedroom
      window, where her quest was in progress, and saw a strange
      sight in the next garden. There was a lady in white satin
      with pearls; there was a gentleman in Roman toga with a
      feathered cap. The Roman gentleman was a dubious figure;
      the lady indubitable. If ever there was an elderly
      Cleopatra, this was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks sat heavily down, after observing this sight.
      It certainly was Cleopatra in the next garden: as certainly
      it was a snake in the grass. In a moment her mind was made
      up. She saw why she had been discouraged from being
      Cleopatra; the false Mrs. Altham had wanted to be Cleopatra
      herself, without rival. But she would be Cleopatra too.
      Riseborough should judge between the effectiveness of the
      two representations. Of course, every one knew that Mrs.
      Altham had three rows of Roman pearls, which were nothing
      but some sort of vitreous enamel. But Mrs. Brooks, as
      Riseborough also knew, had five or six rows of real
      seed-pearls. It was impossible to <i>denigrer</i>
      seed-pearls: they were pearls, though small, and did not
      pretend to be anything different to what they were. But the
      Roman prefix, to any fair-minded person, invalidated the
      word "pearls." Besides, even as Cleopatra without pearls,
      she would have been willing to back herself against Mrs.
      Altham. Cleopatra ought to be tall, which she was. Also
      Cleopatra ought to be beautiful, which neither was. And
      Mrs. Altham had urged her to go as Hermione! Of course, she
      had to revise her toilet, but luckily it had progressed no
      further than the sewing of white rosettes on to a pair of
      slightly worn satin shoes, which were equally suitable for
      any of Shakespeare's heroines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week which had passed for Mr. and Mrs. Altham in a
      succession of so pleasing excitements and anxieties, had
      not been without incident to Mrs. Ames. When (by the same
      post that bore their invitations to the other guests) the
      announcement of the fancy dress ball reached her, and she
      read it out to her husband (even as Mrs. Altham had done)
      towards the end of dinner, he expressed his feelings with a
      good deal of pooh-ing and the opinion that he, at any rate,
      was past the years of dressing-up. This attitude (for it
      had been settled that the invitation was to come as a
      surprise to him) he somewhat overdid, and found to his
      dismay that his wife quite agreed with him, and was
      prepared as soon as dinner was over to write regrets. The
      reason was not far to seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am not what--what the servants call 'touchy,'"
      she said (and indeed, it was difficult to see what else the
      servants could call it), "but I must say that, considering
      the length of time we have been in Riseborough, and the
      number of entertainments we have provided for the people
      here, I think dear Millie might have consulted me--or you,
      of course, Lyndhurst, in my absence--as to any such novelty
      as a fancy dress ball. I have no wish to interfere in any
      way with any little party that dear Millie may choose to
      give, but I suppose since she can plan it without me, she
      can also enjoy it without me. I am aware I am by no means
      necessary to the success of any party. And since you think
      that you are a little beyond the age of dressing up,
      Lyndhurst--though I do not say I agree with you--I think we
      shall be happier at home that night. I will write quite
      kindly to dear Millie, and say we are engaged. No doubt the
      Althams would dine with us, as I do not imagine that she
      would care to get up in fancy dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames was not a quick thinker, but he saw several
      things without a pause. One was that he, at any rate, must
      certainly go, but that he did not much care whether Amy
      went or not. A second was that, having expressed surprise
      at the announcement of the party, it was too late now to
      say that he knew about it from the first, and was going to
      impersonate Antony, while Mrs. Evans was to be Cleopatra. A
      third was that something had to be done, a fourth that he
      did not know what.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will leave you to your cigarette, Lyndhurst," said his
      wife, rising, "and will write to dear Millie. Let us stroll
      in the garden again to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed out of the dining-room, he closed the door
      behind her, and she went straight to her writing-table in
      the drawing-room. Above it hung a looking-glass, and (still
      not in the frame of mind which servants call "touchy") she
      sat down to write the kind note. A considerable degree of
      sunset still lingered in the western sky, and there would
      be no need to light a candle to write by. There was light
      enough also for her to see a rosy-tinted image of herself
      in the glass, and she paused. She saw there, what she was
      aware Mrs. Altham had seen this afternoon--namely, the
      absence of grey in her hair, and the softened and liquated
      wrinkles of her face. True, not even yet had her husband
      observed, or at any rate commented on those refurbished
      signals of her youth, but Mrs. Ames had by no means yet
      despaired, and daily (as directed) tapped in the emollient
      cream. This rosy light of sunset gave her face a flush of
      delicate colour, and she unconsciously claimed for her own
      the borrowed enchantment of the light. . . . Then that
      which was not touchiness underwent a similar softening to
      that of her wrinkles. She knew she had been guilty of
      sarcastic intention when she said she was aware that her
      presence was not necessary to the success of any party. It
      would be unkind to dear Millie if she refused to go, for a
      dinner-party at home was no excuse at all; she could
      perfectly well go on there when carriages came at twenty
      minutes to eleven. Also it was absurd for Lyndhurst to say
      that he was past the age when "dressing up" is seemly. In
      spite of his hair, which he managed very well, he was still
      young enough in face to excuse the yielding to the
      temptation of embellishing himself, and a Venetian mantle
      would naturally conceal his tendency to corpulence. No
      doubt dear Millie had not meant to put herself forward in
      any way; no doubt she had not yet really grasped the fact
      that Mrs. Ames was acknowledged autocrat in all that
      concerned festivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this train of thought needed but a few seconds for
      passage, and, as she still regarded herself, the name of
      the heroines of enchantment sounded delicately in her
      brain. Juliet and Ophelia she passed over without a pang,
      for she was not so unfocussed of imagination as to see her
      reflection capable of recapturing the budding spring of
      those, or the slim youthfulness of Rosalind. She wanted no
      girlish role, nor did she read into herself the precocious
      dignity of Portia. But was there not one who came down the
      green Nile to the sound of flutes in a gilded barge--no
      girl, but a woman in the charm of her full maturity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea detailed itself in plan and man&oelig;uvre. She
      wanted to burst on Lyndhurst like that, to let him see in a
      flash of revelation how bravely she could support the rle
      of that sorceress. . . . At the moment the drawing-room
      door opened, and simultaneously they both began a sentence
      in identical words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, my dear, I've been thinking . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      They both stopped, and he gave his genial laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my soul, my dear Amy," he said, "I believe we always
      have the same thoughts. I'll tell you what you were going
      to say. You were going to say, 'I've been thinking it
      wouldn't be very kind to dear Millie'--that is what
      <i>you</i> would say, of course--not very kind to Mrs.
      Evans if we declined. And I agree with you, my dear. No
      doubt she should have consulted you first, or if you were
      away she might even, as you suggested, have mentioned it to
      me. But you can afford to be indulgent, my dear--after all,
      she is your cousin--and you wouldn't like to spoil her
      party, poor thing, by refusing to go. And if you go, why,
      of course, I shall put on one side my natural feelings
      about an old fogey like myself making a guy of himself, and
      I shall dress up somehow. I think I have an old costume
      with a Venetian cloak laid aside somewhere, though I
      daresay it's moth-eaten and rusty now, and I'll dress
      myself up somehow and come with you. I suppose there are
      some old stagers in Shakespeare--I must have a look at the
      fellow's plays again--which even a retired old soldier can
      impersonate. Falstaff, for instance--some stout old man of
      that sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of this speech, to say the least of it, was not, it is
      to be feared, quite absolutely ingenuous. But then, Major
      Ames was not naturally quite ingenuous. He had already
      satisfied himself that the old costume in question had been
      perfectly preserved by the naphthaline balls which he was
      careful to renew from time to time, and was not in the
      least moth-eaten or rusty. Again, since he had settled to
      go as Antony, it was not perfectly straightforward to make
      allusion to Falstaff. But after all, the speech expressed
      all he meant to say, and it is only our most fortunate
      utterances that can do as much. Indeed, perhaps it leaned
      over a little to the further side of expression, for it
      struck Mrs. Ames at that moment (struck her as violently
      and inexplicably as a cocoa-nut falling on her head) that
      the question of the Venetian cloak had not come into her
      husband's mind for the first time that evening. She felt,
      without being able to explain her feeling, that the idea of
      the fancy dress ball was not new to him. But it was
      impossible to tax him with so profound a duplicity; indeed,
      when she gave a moment's consideration to the question, she
      dismissed her suspicion. But the suspicion had been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him quite half-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have guessed quite right, Lyndhurst," she said; "I
      think it would be unkind to dear Millie if you and I did
      not go. I dare say she will have difficulty enough as it is
      to make a gathering. I will write at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was soon done, and even as she wrote, poor Mrs. Ames'
      vision of herself grew more roseate in her mind. But she
      must burst upon her husband, she must burst upon him.
      Supposing her preposterous suspicion of a moment before was
      true, there was all the more need for bursting upon him,
      for Cleopatraizing herself. . . . He, meantime, was
      wondering how on earth to keep the secret of his costume
      and his hostess's, should Amy proceed to discuss costumes,
      or suggest the King and Queen of Denmark as suitable for
      themselves. It might even be better to accept the situation
      as such, and tell Mrs. Evans that his wife wanted to go as
      "a pair" (so Mrs. Altham expressed it) and that it was more
      prudent to abandon the idea of a stray Antony and a stray
      Cleopatra meeting on the evening itself unpremeditatedly.
      But her next words caused all these difficulties to
      disappear; they vanished as completely as a watch or a
      rabbit under the wave of the conjurer's wand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames never licked envelopes; she applied water on a
      camel's-hair brush, from a little receptacle like a
      tear-bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense, my dear Lyndhurst," she said. "Fancy you
      going as Falstaff! You must think of something better than
      that! Dear me, it is a very bold idea of Millie's, but
      really it seems to me that we might have great fun. I do
      hope that all Riseborough will not talk their costumes over
      together, so that we shall know exactly what to expect.
      There is little point in a fancy dress ball unless there
      are some surprises. I must think over my costume too. I am
      not so fortunate as to have one ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up from the table, still with the roseate image of
      herself in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall not tell you who I am going to be," she
      said, "even when I have thought of something suitable. I
      shall keep myself as a surprise for you. And keep yourself
      as a surprise for me, Lyndhurst. Let us meet for the first
      time in our costumes when the carriage is at the door ready
      to take us to the party. Do you not think that would be
      fun? But you must promise me, my dear, that you will not
      make yourself up as Falstaff, or any old guy. Else I shall
      be quite ashamed of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell effusively (the heartiness of the action
      was typical of the welcome he gave to his wife's
      suggestion), and ordered the note to be sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! Amy," he said, "what a one you always are for
      thinking of things. And if you wish it, I'll try to make a
      presentable figure of myself, though I'm sure I should be
      more in place at home waiting for your return to hear all
      about it. But I'll do my best, I'll do my best, and I dare
      say the Venetian cloak isn't so shabby after all. I have
      always been careful to keep a bit of naphthaline in the box
      with it."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Flirtation may not be incorrectly defined as making the
      pretence of being in love, and yet it is almost too solid a
      word to apply to Major Ames' relations with Mrs. Evans
      during the week or two before the ball, and it would be
      more accurate to say that he was making the pretence of
      having a flirtation. Even as when he kissed her on that
      daring evening already described, he was thinking entirely
      about himself and the dashingness of this proceeding, so in
      the days that succeeded, this same inept futility and
      self-satisfaction possessed him. He made many secret visits
      to the house, entering like a burglar, in the middle of the
      afternoon, by an unfrequented passage from the railway
      cutting, at hours when she had told him that her husband
      and daughter would certainly be out, and the secrecy of
      those meetings added spice to them. He felt--so deplorable
      a frame of mind almost defies description--he felt a
      pleasing sense of wickedness which was endorsed, so to
      speak, by the certificate which attested to his complete
      innocence. As far as he was concerned, it was a mere farce
      of a flirtation. But the farce filled him with a kind of
      childish glee; he persuaded himself that his share in it
      was real, and that by a tragic fate he and the woman who
      were made for each other were forbidden to find the
      fruition of their affinity. It was an adventure without
      danger, a mine without gunpowder. For even on two occasions
      when he was paying one of these clandestine visits, Dr.
      Evans had unexpectedly returned and found them together.
      The poor blind man, it seemed, suspected nothing; indeed,
      his welcome had been extremely cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good of you to come and help my wife over her party," he
      said. "What you'd do without Major Ames, little woman, I
      don't know. Won't you stop for dinner, Major?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a suitable reply, and a digression to other
      matters, the Major's foolish eye would steal a look at
      Millie, and for a moment her eyes would meet his, and
      flutter and fall. And considering that there was not in all
      the world probably a worse judge of human nature than Major
      Ames, it is a strange thing that his mental comment was
      approximately true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear little woman," he said to himself; "she's deuced fond
      of me!"

    <p>
      Jupiter Pluvius, or Mr. J. Pluvius, by which name Major
      Ames was facetiously wont to allude to the weather, seemed
      amiably inclined to co-operate with Mrs. Evans' scheme, for
      the evening of her party promised to be ideal for the
      purpose. The few days previous had been very hot, and no
      particle of moisture lurked in the baked lawns, so that her
      guests would be able to wander at will without risk of
      contracting catarrh, or stains on such shoes as should
      prove to be white satin. Moreover, by a special kindness of
      Providence, there was no moon, so that the illumination of
      fairy-lights and Chinese lanterns would suffer no
      dispiriting comparison with a more potent brightness. Over
      a large portion of the lawn Mrs. Evans, at Major Ames'
      suggestion (not having to pay for these paraphernalia he
      was singularly fruitful in suggestions), had caused a
      planked floor to be laid; here the opening procession and
      quadrille and the subsequent dances would take place, while
      conveniently adjacent was the mulberry-tree under shade of
      which were spread the more material hospitalities. Tree and
      dancing-floor were copiously outlined with lanterns, and
      straight rows of fairy-lights led to them from the garden
      door of the house. Similarly outlined was the garden wall
      and the hedge by the railway-cutting, while the band
      (piano, two strings and a cornet of amazingly piercing
      quality) was to be concealed in the small <i>cul-de-sac</i>
      which led to the potting shed and garden roller. The
      shrubbery was less vividly lit; here Hamlets and Rosalinds
      could stray in sequestered couples, unharassed by too
      searching an illumination. Major Ames had paid his last
      clandestine visit this afternoon, and had expressed himself
      as perfectly pleased with the arrangements. Both Elsie and
      the doctor had been there.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The party had been announced to begin at half-past ten, and
      it was scarcely that hour when Mrs. Ames came downstairs
      from her bedroom where she had so long been busy since the
      end of the early dinner. Her arms were bare from finger-tip
      to her little round shoulders, over which were clasped,
      with handsome cairngorm brooches, the straps of her long
      tunic. But there was no effect of an excessive display of
      human flesh, since her arms were very short, and in
      addition they were plentifully bedecked. On one arm a
      metallic snake writhed from wrist to elbow, on the other
      there was clasped above the elbow a plain circlet of some
      very bright and shining metal. A net of blue beads
      altogether too magnificent to be turquoises, was pinned
      over her unfaded hair, and from the front of it there
      depended on her forehead a large pear-shaped pearl,
      suggestive of the one which the extravagant queen
      subsequently dissolved in vinegar. Any pearl, so scientists
      tell us, which is capable of solution in vinegar must be a
      curious pearl; that which Mrs. Ames wore in the middle of
      her forehead was curious also. Art had been specially
      invoked, over and above the normal skin-food to-night, in
      the matter of Mrs. Ames' face, and a formal Egyptian
      eyebrow, as indicated in the illustration to "Rameses" in
      the <i>Encyclopdia,</i> decorated in charcoal the place
      where her own eyebrow once was. Below her eye a touch of
      the same charcoal added brilliancy to the eye itself;
      several touches of rouge contributed their appropriate
      splendour to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long tunic which was held up over her shoulders by the
      cairngorm brooches, reached to her knee. It was a little
      tight, perhaps, but when you have only one Arab shawl, shot
      with copious gold thread, you have to make it go as far as
      it can, and after all, it went to her knees. A small fold
      of it was looped up, and fell over her yellow girdle, it
      was parted at the sides below the hips, and disclosed a
      skirt made of two Arab shawls shot with silver, which,
      stitched together, descended to her ankle. She did not mean
      to dance anything except the opening quadrille. Below this
      silver-streaked skirt appeared, as was natural, her pretty
      plump little feet. On them she wore sandals which exhibited
      their plumpness and prettiness and smallness to the fullest
      extent. A correct strap lay between the great toe and the
      next, and the straps were covered with silver paper. For
      years Riseborough had known how small were her shoes;
      to-night Riseborough should see that those shoes had been
      amply large enough for what they contained. Round her neck,
      finally, were four rows of magnificent pearl beads; no
      wonder Cleopatra thought nothing of dissolving one pearl,
      when its dissolution would leave intact so populous a
      company of similar treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came downstairs she heard a sudden noise in the
      drawing-room, as if a heavy man had suddenly stumbled. It
      required no more ingenuity than was normally hers to
      conjecture that Lyndhurst was already there, and had
      tripped himself up in some novel accoutrement. And at that,
      a sudden flush of excitement and anticipation invaded her,
      and she wondered what he would be like. As regards herself
      she felt the profoundest confidence in the success of her
      garniture. He could scarcely help being amazed, delighted.
      And an emotion never keenly felt by her, but as such long
      outworn, shook her and made her knees tremulous. She felt
      so young, so daring. She wished that at this moment he
      would come out, for as she descended the stairs he could
      not but see how small and soft were her feet. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost before her wish was formed, it was granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-smothered oath succeeded the stumbling noise, and
      Major Ames, in white Roman toga and tights came out into
      the hall. There was no vestige of Venetian cloak about him;
      he was altogether different from what she had expected. A
      profuse wig covered his head, the toga completely masked
      what the exercise with the garden roller had not completely
      removed, and below, his big calves rose majestic over his
      classical laced shoes. If ever there was a Mark Antony with
      a military moustache, he was not in Egypt nor in Rome, but
      here; by a divine chance, without consultation, he had
      chosen for himself the character complementary to hers. He
      looked up and saw her, she looked down and saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul," he said. "Amy! Cleopatra!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a happy little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul," she said. "Lyndhurst! Mark Antony!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long and an awful pause. It was quite clear to
      her that something had occurred totally unexpected. She had
      wanted to be unexpected, but there was something wrong
      about the quality of his surprise. Then such manliness as
      there was in him came to his aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," he said, "you have got yourself up
      splendidly, Amy. Cleopatra now, pearls and all, and
      sandals! Why, you'll take the shine out of them all! Here
      we go, eh? Antony and Cleopatra! Who would have thought of
      it! The cab's round, dear. We had better be starting, if
      we're to take part in the procession. Not want a cloak or
      anything? Antony and Cleopatra; God bless my soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was sufficient to allay the immediate embarrassment.
      True, he had not been knocked over by this apparition of
      her in the way she had meant, and the astonished pause, she
      was afraid, was not one of surrendering admiration. And
      yet, perhaps, he was feeling shy, even as she was; standing
      here in all this splendour of shining pantomime he might
      well feel her to be as strange to him, as she felt him to
      be to her. Moreover, she had not only to look Cleopatra,
      but to be Cleopatra, to behave herself with the gaiety and
      youth which her appearance gave him the right to expect. In
      the meantime he also had earned her compliments, for no man
      who thinks it worth while to assume a fancy dress has a
      soul so unhuman as to be unappreciative of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell back a step or two to regard him comprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said, "you are splendid; that toga suits you
      to admiration. And your arms look so well coming out of the
      folds of it. What great strong arms, Lyndhurst! You could
      pick up your little Cleopatra and carry her back--back to
      Egypt so easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of their irresponsibility which, as by a special
      Providence, broods over the audacity of assuming strange
      guises, descended on her. She could no more have made such
      a speech to him in her ordinary morning-clothes, nor yet in
      the famous rose-coloured silk, than she could have flown.
      But now her costume unloosed her tongue. And despite the
      dreadful embarrassment that he knew would await him when
      they got to the party, and a second Cleopatra welcomed
      them, this intoxication of costume (liable, unfortunately,
      to manifest itself not only in <i>vin gai)</i> mounted to
      his head also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ma reine!"</i> he said, feeling that French brought
      them somehow closer to the appropriate Oriental atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up her skirt with one hand, and gave him the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must be off, my Antony," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got into the cab; a somewhat jaded-looking horse was
      lashed into a slow and mournful trot, and they rattled away
      down the hard, dry road.
    </p>
    <p>
      A queue of carriages was already waiting to disembark its
      cargoes when they drew near the house, and leaning
      furtively and feverishly from the window, Mrs. Ames saw a
      Hamlet or two and some Titanias swiftly and shyly cross the
      pavement between two rows of the astonished proletariat.
      Beside her in the cab her husband grunted and fidgeted; she
      guessed that to him this entrance was of the nature of
      bathing on a cold day; however invigorating might be the
      subsequent swim, the plunge was chilly. But she little knew
      the true cause of his embarrassment and apprehension; had
      his military career ever entailed (which it had not) the
      facing of fire, it was probable, though his courage was of
      no conspicuous a kind, that he would have met the guns with
      greater blitheness than he awaited the moment that now
      inevitably faced him. Then came their turn; there was a
      pause, and then their carriage door was flung open, and
      they descended from the innocent vehicle that to him was as
      portentous as a tumbril. In a moment Cleopatra would meet
      Cleopatra, and he could form no idea how either Cleopatra
      would take it. The Cleopatra-hostess, as he knew, was going
      to wear sandals also; snakes were to writhe up her long
      white arms. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames adjusted the pear-shaped pearl on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think if we say half-past one it will be late enough,
      Lyndhurst," she said. "If we are not ready he can wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Lyndhurst that half-past one would probably be
      quite late enough.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The assemblage of guests took place in the drawing-room
      which opened into the garden; a waiter from the "Crown"
      inn, with a chin beard and dressed in a sort of white
      surplice and carrying a lantern in his hand, who might with
      equal reasonableness be supposed to be the Man in the Moon
      out of the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream,</i> or a
      grave-digger out of <i>Hamlet,</i> said "Character names,
      please, ma'am," and preceded them to the door of this
      chamber. He bawled out "Cleopatra and Mark Antony."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Cleopatra, a "different conception of this part,"
      as the <i>Kent Chronicle</i> said in its next issue, a
      Cleopatra dim and white and willowy, advanced to them. She
      looked vexed, but as she ran her eyes up and down Mrs.
      Ames' figure, like a practised pianist playing a chromatic
      scale, her vexation seemed completely to clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Cousin Amy," she said, "how perfectly lovely! I never
      saw--Wilfred, make your bow to Cleopatra. And Antony! Oh,
      Major Ames!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she made the chromatic scale, starting at the top, so
      to speak (his face), with a long note, and dwelling there
      again when she returned to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other arrivals followed, and this particular Antony and
      Cleopatra mingled with such guests as were already
      assembled. The greater part had gathered, and Mrs. Ames'
      habitual manner and bearing suited excellently with her
      regal role. The Turner family, at any rate, who were
      standing a little apart from the others, not being quite
      completely "in" Riseborough society, and, feeling rather
      hot and feverish in the thick brocaded stuffs suitable to
      Falstaff, Mistress Page and King Theseus, felt neither more
      nor less uncomfortable when she made a few complimentary
      remarks to them than they did when, with her fat
      prayer-book in her hand, she spoke to them after church on
      Sunday. Elsewhere young Morton, with a white face and a red
      nose, was the traditional Apothecary, and Mrs. Taverner was
      so copiously apparalled as Queen Catherine that she was
      looking forward very much indeed to the moment when the
      procession should go forth into the greater coolness of the
      night air. Then a stentorian announcement from the waiter
      at the Crown made every one turn again to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Antony and Cleopatra ten years later," he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause. Then entered Mr. and Mrs. Altham
      with high-held hands clasped at fingertips. They both
      stepped rather high, she holding her skirt away from her
      feet, and both pointing their toes as if performing a
      <i>pavanne.</i> This entry had been much rehearsed, and it
      was arresting to the point of producing a sort of
      stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans ran her eye up and down the pair, and was
      apparently satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mrs. Altham," she said, "how perfectly lovely!
      <i>And</i> Mr. Altham. But ten years later! You must not
      ask us to believe that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her husband and spoke quickly, with a look on
      her face less amiable than she usually wore in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilfred," she said, "tell the band to begin the opening
      march at once for the procession, in case there are any
      more--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he interrupted--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's another, Millie," he said cheerfully. "Yes, we'd
      better begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      His speech was drowned by the voice of the brazen-lunged
      waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cleopatra!" he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks entered with all the rows of seed-pearls.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Riseborough, if the census papers were consulted, might
      perhaps not prove to have an abnormally large percentage of
      inhabitants who had reached middle-age, but certainly in
      the festivities of its upper circles, maturity held an
      overwhelming majority over youth. It was so to-night, and
      of the half-hundred folk who thus masqueraded, there were
      few who were not, numerically speaking, of thoroughly
      discreet years. The diffused knowledge of this undoubtedly
      gave confidence to their gaiety, for there was no
      unconscious standard of sterling youth by which their
      slightly mature exhilaration could be judged and found
      deficient in genuine and natural effervescence. Thus,
      despite the somewhat untoward conjunction of four matronly
      Cleopatras, a spirit of extraordinary gaiety soon possessed
      the entire party. Odious comparisons might conceivably
      spring up mushroom-like tomorrow, and (unmushroom-like)
      continue to wax and flourish through many days and dinners,
      but to-night so large an environment of elderly people gave
      to every one of those elderly people a pleasant sense of
      not suffering but rather shining in comparison with the
      others. Even the Cleopatras themselves were content; Mrs.
      Ames, for instance, saw how sensible it was that Mrs.
      Altham should announce herself as a Cleopatra of ten years
      later, while Mrs. Altham, observing Mrs. Ames, saw how
      supererogatory her titular modesty had been, and wondered
      that Mrs. Ames cared to show her feet like that, while Mrs.
      Brooks knew that everybody was mentally contrasting her
      queenliness of height with Mrs. Ames' paucity of inches,
      and her abundance of beautiful hair with Mrs. Altham's
      obvious wig. While, all the time, Mrs. Evans, whom the
      appearance of a fourth Cleopatra had considerably upset for
      the moment, felt that at this rate she could easily
      continue being Cleopatra for more years than "the ten
      after," so properly assumed by Mrs. Altham. In the same way
      Major Ames, with his six feet of solid English bone and
      muscle, and his fifth decade of years still but
      half-consumed, felt that Mr. Altham had but provided a
      scale of comparison uncommonly flattering to himself.
      Simultaneously, Mr. Altham, with a laurel-wreath round his
      head, reflected how uncomfortable he would have felt if his
      laurel-wreath was anchored on no sounder a foundation than
      a wig, and wondered if gardening (on the principle that all
      flesh is grass) invariably resulted in so great a growth of
      tissue. But all these pleasant self-communings were,
      indeed, but a minor tributary to the real river of
      enjoyment that danced and chattered through the starlit
      hours of this July night. Somehow the whole assembly seemed
      to have shifted off themselves the natural and inevitable
      burden of their years; they danced and mildly flirted, they
      sat out in the dim shrubbery, and played on the sea-shore
      of life again, finding the sand-castles had become real
      once more. Mrs. Ames, for instance, had intended to dance
      nothing but the opening quadrille, but before the second
      dance, which was a waltz, had come to a close, she had
      accepted Mr. Altham's offer, and was slowly capering round
      with him. A little care was necessary in order not to put
      too unjust a strain on the sandal straps, but she exercised
      this precaution, and was sorry, though hot, when the dance
      came to an end. Then Major Ames, who had been piloting Mrs.
      Altham, joined them at the moselle-cup table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my word, Altham," he said, "I don't know what to say
      to you. You've taken my Cleopatra, but then I've taken
      yours. Exchange no robbery, hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife tapped him on the arm with her palmette fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lyndhurst, go along with you!" she said, employing an
      expression, the mental equivalent of which she did not know
      ever existed in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go along," he said. "But which is my Cleopatra?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, Mrs. Evans approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My two Cleopatras must excuse me," said this amazing man.
      "I am engaged for this next dance to the Cleopatra of us
      all. Ha! Ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered his arm to Mrs. Evans, and they went out of the
      cave of the mulberry-tree again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band had not yet struck up for the next dance, the
      majority of the guests were flocking under the
      mulberry-tree at the conclusion of the last, and for the
      moment they had the cool starlit dusk to themselves. And
      then, all at once, the Major's sense of boisterous
      enjoyment deserted him; he felt embarrassed with a secret
      knowledge that he was expected to say something in tune
      with this privacy. How that expectation was conveyed he
      hardly knew; the slight pressure on his arm seemed to
      announce it unmistakably. It reminded him that he was a
      man, and yet with all that gaiety and gallantry that were
      so conspicuous a feature in his behaviour to women in
      public, he felt awkward and ill at ease. He embarked on a
      course of desperate and fulsome eulogy, longing in his
      private soul for the band to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my soul, you are an enchantress, Millie!" he said.
      "You come to our staid, respectable old Riseborough, and
      before you have been here six months you take us all into
      fairyland. Positively fairyland. And--and I've never seen
      you looking so lovely as to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us stroll all round the garden," she said. "I want you
      to see it all now it is lit up. And the shrubbery is
      pretty, too, with--with the filter of starlight coming
      through the trees. Do tell me truthfully, like a friend, is
      it going all right? Are they enjoying themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kicking up their heels like two-year-olds," said Major
      Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How wicked of you to say that! But really I had one bad
      moment, when--when the last Cleopatra came in."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment. Then in her clear, silky voice--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old things!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mrs. Evans was not in any way a clever woman, but had
      she had the brains and the wit of Cleopatra herself, she
      could not have spoken three more consummately chosen words.
      All the cool, instinctive confidence of a younger woman,
      and a pretty woman speaking of the more elderly and plain
      was there; there, too, was the deliberate challenge of the
      coquette. And Major Ames was quite helpless against the
      simplicity of such art. Mere manners, the ordinary code of
      politeness, demanded that he should agree with his hostess.
      Besides, though he was not in any way in love with her, he
      could not resist the assumption that her words implied,
      and, after all, she was a pretty woman, whom he had kissed,
      and he was alone in the star-hung dusk with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear Amy!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie Evans gave a soft little sigh, as of a contented
      child. He had expressed with the most ruthless accuracy
      exactly what she wished him to feel. Then, in the manner of
      a woman whose nature is warped throughout by a slight but
      ingrained falsity, she spoke as if it was not she who had
      prompted the three words which she had almost made him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is enjoying herself so," she said. "I have never seen
      Cousin Amy look so thoroughly pleased and contented. I
      thought she looked so charming, too, and what dear, plump
      little feet she has. But, my dear, it was rather a surprise
      when you and she were announced. It looked as if this poor
      Cleopatra was going to be Antony-less! Dear me, what a
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a more direct appeal, and again Major Ames was
      powerless in her soft clutch. Hers was not exactly an iron
      hand in a velvet glove, but a hand made of fly-catching
      paper. She had taken her glove off now. And he was
      beginning to stick to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, again, had a perfectly satisfactory sound to her
      ears. The very abruptness and bluffness of it pleased her
      more than any protestation could have done. He was so
      direct, so shy, so manly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, you mustn't say those things," she said. "Ah, there
      is the band beginning, and it is our dance. But let us just
      walk through the shrubbery before we go back. The dusk and
      quiet are such a relief after the glare. Lyndhurst--ah,
      dear me. Cousin Lyndhurst I ought to say--you really must
      not go home till my little dance is quite finished. You
      make things go so well. Dear Wilfred is quite useless to
      me. Does he not look an old darling as Timon of Athens? A
      sort of mixture between George the Fourth in tights and a
      lion-tamer."

      Mrs. Evans was feeling more actively alive to-night than
      she had felt for years. Her tongue, which was generally a
      rather halting adjutant to her glances and little sinuous
      movements, was almost vivified to wit. Certainly her
      description of her husband had acuteness and a sense of the
      ludicrous to inspire it. Through the boughs of laburnums in
      the shrubbery they could see him now, escorting the tallest
      and oldest Cleopatra, who was Mrs. Brooks, to the end of
      the garden. Dimly, through the curtain of intervening
      gloom, they saw the populous wooden floor that had been
      laid down on the grass; Mrs. Ames--the dance was a
      polka--was frankly pirouetting in the arms of a redoubtable
      Falstaff. Mrs. Altham was wrestling with the Apothecary,
      and Elsie Evans, one of the few young people present, was
      vainly trying to galvanize General Fortescue, thinly
      disguised as Henry VII, into some semblance of activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans gave another sigh, a sigh of curious calibre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It all seems so distant," she said. "All the lights and
      dancing are less real than the shadows and the stillness."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not quite extemporaneous; she had thought over
      something of the sort. It had the effect of making Major
      Ames feel suddenly hot with an anxious kind of heat. He was
      beginning to perceive the truth of that which he had
      foppishly imagined in his own self-communings, namely, that
      this "poor little lady" was very, very much attached to
      him. He had often dwelt on the thought before with odious
      self-centred satisfaction; now the thought was less
      satisfactory; it was disquieting and mildly alarming. Like
      the fly on the fly-paper, with one leg already englued, he
      put down a second to get leverage with which to free the
      first, and found that it was adhering also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took such pleasure in all the preparations." she said.
      "You were so much interested in it all. Tell me, Cousin
      Lyndhurst, that you are not disappointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly possible for him to do less than what he did.
      What he did was little enough. He pressed the arm that lay
      in his rather close to his white toga, and an unwonted
      romanticism of speech rose to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have enchanted me," he said. "Me, us, all of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little laugh; in the dusk it sounded no louder
      than a breeze stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't have added that," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where she stood a diaper of light and shadow played over
      her. A little spray of laburnum between her face and the
      lights on the lawn outside, swaying gently in a breeze that
      had gone astray in this calm night, cast wavering shadows
      over her. Now her arms shone white under freckles of
      shadow, now it was her face that was a moon to him. Or
      again, both would be in shade and a diamond star on her
      bright yellow hair concentrated all the light into itself.
      All the elusive mysterious charm of her womanhood was
      there, made more real by the fantastic setting. He was
      kindled to a greater warmth than he had yet known, but, all
      the time, some dreadful creature in his semi-puritanical
      semi-immoral brain, told him that this was all "devilish
      naughty." He was as unused to such scruples as he was
      unused to such temptations, and in some curious fashion he
      felt as ashamed of the one as he felt afraid of the other.
      At length he summed up the whole of these despicable
      conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you give me just one kiss, Millie!" he said; "just
      one cousin-kiss, before we go and dance?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Such early worms next morning in Major Ames' garden as had
      escaped the early bird, must certainly have all been caught
      and laid out flat by the garden roller, so swift and
      incessant were its journeyings. For though the dawn had
      overspread the sky with the hueless tints of approaching
      day when Antony and Cleopatra were charioteered home again
      by a somnolent cabman; though Major Ames' repose had been
      of the most fragmentary kind, and though breakfast, in
      anticipation of late hours, had been ordered the night
      before at an unusual half-past nine, he found his bed an
      intolerable abode by seven o'clock, and had hoped to
      expatriate somewhat disquieting thoughts from his mind by
      the application of his limbs to severe bodily exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his wife had been the last guests to leave; indeed,
      after the others had gone they lingered a little, smoking a
      final cigarette. Even Mrs. Ames had been persuaded to light
      one, but a convulsive paroxysm of coughing, which made the
      pear-shaped pearl to quiver and shake like an aspen-leaf,
      led her to throw it away, saying she enjoyed it very much.
      He had danced with Mrs. Evans three or four times; three or
      four times they had sat in the cool darkness of the
      shrubbery, and he had said to her several things which at
      the moment it seemed imperative to say, but which he did
      not really mean. But as the evening went on he had meant
      them more; she had a helpless, childlike charm about her
      that began to stir his senses. And yet below that childlike
      confiding manner he was dimly aware that there was an eager
      woman's soul that sought him. Her charm was a weapon; a
      very efficient will wielded it. All the same, he reflected
      as the honest dews of toil poured from his forehead this
      morning in the hot early sunlight, he had not said very
      much . . . he had said that Riseborough was a different
      place since she--or had he said "they"? had come there;
      that her eyes looked black in the starlight,
      that--honestly, he could not remember anything more
      intimate than this. But that which had made his bed
      intolerable was the sense that the situation had not
      terminated last night, that his boat, so to speak, had not
      been drawn up safely ashore, but was still in the midst of
      accelerating waters. And yet it was in his own power to
      draw the boat ashore at any moment; he had but to take a
      decisive stroke to land, to step out and beach it, to
      return--surely it was not difficult--to his normal thoughts
      and activities. For years his garden, his club, his
      domestic concerns, his daily paper, had provided him with a
      sufficiency of pursuits; he had but to step back into their
      safe if monotonous circle, and look upon these disturbances
      as episodic. But already he had ceased to think of Mrs.
      Evans as "dear little woman" or "poor little woman";
      somehow it seemed as if she had got her finger--to use a
      prosaic metaphor--into his works. She was prodding about
      among the internal wheels and springs of his mechanism. Yet
      that was stating his case too strongly; it was that of
      contingency that he was afraid. But with the curious
      irresponsibility of a rather selfish and unimaginative man,
      the fact that he had allowed himself to prod about in her
      internal mechanism represented itself to him as an
      unimportant and negligible detail. It was only when she
      began prodding about in him, producing, as it were,
      extraordinary little whirrings and racings of wheels that
      had long gone slow and steady, that he began to think that
      anything significant was occurring. But, after all, there
      was nothing like a pull at the garden roller for giving a
      fellow an appetite for breakfast and for squashing worms
      and unprofitable reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though half-past nine had seemed "late enough for anybody,"
      as Mrs. Ames had said the evening before, it was not till
      nearly ten that she put an extra spoonful of tea into her
      silver teapot, for she felt that she needed a more than
      usually fortifying beverage, to nullify her disinclination
      for the day's routine. The sight of her Cleopatra costume
      also, laid upon the sofa in her bedroom, and shone upon by
      a cheerful and uncompromising summer sun, had awakened in
      her mind a certain discontent, a certain sense of
      disappointment, of age, of grievance. The gilt paper had
      moulted off one of the sandal-straps, a spilt dropping of
      strawberry-ice made a disfiguring spot on the tunic of Arab
      shawl, and she herself felt vaguely ungilded and
      disfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigarette, too--she had so often said in the most
      liberal manner that she did not think it wicked of women to
      smoke, but only horrid. Certainly she did not feel wicked
      this morning, but as certainly she felt disposed to
      consider anybody else horrid, and--and possibly wicked.
      Decidedly a cup of strong tea was indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames had gone upstairs again to have his bath, and to
      dress after his exercise in the garden, and came down a few
      minutes later, smelling of soap, with a jovial
      boisterousness of demeanour that smelt of unreality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, my dear Amy," he said. "And how do you feel
      after the party? I've been up a couple of hours; nothing
      like a spell of exercise to buck one up after late hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have your tea now, Lyndhurst?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have it now, or wait till I get it, eh? I'll have it now.
      Delicious! I always say that nobody makes tea like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now boisterous spirits at breakfast were not usual with
      Major Ames, and, as has been said, his wife easily detected
      a false air about them. Her vague sense of disappointment
      and grievance began to take more solid outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is delightful to see you in such good spirits,
      Lyndhurst," she observed, with a faint undertone of
      acidity. "Sitting up late does not usually agree with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was enough here to provoke repartee. Also his
      superficial boisterousness was rapidly disappearing before
      his wife's acidity, like stains at the touch of ammonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not, in this instance, seem to have agreed with
      you, my dear," he said. "I hope you have not got a
      headache. It was unwise of you to stop so late. However, no
      doubt we shall feel better after breakfast. Shall I give
      you some bacon? Or will you try something that appears to
      be fish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little kedjeree, please," said Mrs. Ames, pointedly
      ignoring this innuendo on her cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kedjeree, is it? Well, well, live and learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have any complaint to make about Jephson," said
      she, "pray do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not at all. One does not expect, a <i>cordon bleu.</i>
      But I dare say Mrs. Evans pays no more for her cook than we
      do, and look at the supper last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought the quails were peculiarly tasteless," said Mrs.
      Ames; "and if you are to be grand and have <i>pches  la
      Melba,</i> I should prefer to offer my guests real peaches
      and proper ice-cream, instead of tinned peaches and
      custard. I say nothing about the champagne, because I
      scarcely tasted it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, my dear, I'm sure you are quite right not to
      criticize it. All I can say is that I never want to eat a
      better supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mrs. Ames became aware that another piece of solid
      outline had appeared round her vague discontent and
      reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt you think that all Millie's arrangements are
      perfect in every way," she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you mean by that," said he, rather
      hotly; "but I do know that when a woman has been putting
      herself to all that trouble and expense to entertain her
      friends, her friends would show a nicer spirit if they
      refrained from carping and depreciating her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No amount of appreciation would make tinned peaches fresh,
      or turn custard into ice-cream," said Mrs. Ames, laying
      down the fork with which she had dallied with the kedjeree,
      which indeed was but a sordid sort of creation. "It is
      foolish to pretend that a thing is perfect when it is not.
      Nor do I consider her manners as a hostess by any means
      perfect. She looked as cross as two sticks when poor Mrs.
      Brooks appeared. I suppose she thought that nobody had a
      right to be Cleopatra besides herself. To be sure poor Mrs.
      Brooks looked very silly, but if everybody who looked silly
      last night should have stayed away, there would not have
      been much dancing done."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took several more sips of the strong tea, while he
      unfolded and appeared engrossed in the morning paper, and
      under their stimulating influence saw suddenly and
      distinctly how ill-advised was her attack. She had yielded
      to temporary ill-temper, which is always a mistake. It was
      true that in her mind she was feeling that Lyndhurst last
      night had spent far too much time with his hostess; in a
      word, she felt jealous. It was, therefore, abominably
      stupid, from a merely worldly point of view, to criticize
      and belittle Millie to him. If there was absolutely no
      ground for her jealousy--which at present was but a humble
      little green bud--such an attack was uncalled for; if there
      was ground it was most foolish, at this stage, at any rate,
      to give him the least cause for suspecting that it existed.
      But she was wise enough now, not to hasten to repair her
      mistake, but to repair it slowly and deliberately, as if no
      repair was going on at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must say the garden looked charming," she said after
      a pause. "Did she tell you, Lyndhurst, whether it was she
      or her husband who saw to the lighting? The scheme was so
      comprehensive; it took in the whole of the lawn; there was
      nothing patchy about it. I suspect Dr. Evans planned it; it
      looked somehow more like a man's work."
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of furtive guilt passed over the Major's face;
      luckily it was concealed by the <i>Daily Mail.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Evans told me himself that he had nothing to do with
      it," he said. "It was pretty, I thought; very pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the nights continue hot," said she, "it would be nice
      to have the garden illuminated one night, if dear Millie
      did not think we were appropriating her ideas. I do not
      think she would; she is above that sort of thing. Well,
      dear, I must go and order dinner. Have you any wishes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly it was wiser, from the Major's point of view, to
      accept this bouquet of olive branches. After all, Amy was
      far too sensible to imagine that there could be anything to
      rouse the conjugal watch-dog. Nor was there; hastily he
      told himself that. A cousinly kiss, which at the moment he
      would willingly have foregone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly last night he had been a little super-stimulated.
      There was the irresponsibility of fancy dress, there was
      the knowledge that Millie was not insensitive to him; there
      was the sense of his own big, shapely legs in tights, there
      was dancing and lanterns, and all had been potent
      intoxicants to Riseborough, which for so long had practised
      teetotalism with regard to such excitements. Amy herself
      had been so far carried away by this effervescence of
      gaiety as to smoke a cigarette, and Heaven knew how far
      removed from her ordinary code of conduct was such an
      adventure. Generously, he had forborne to brandish that
      cigarette as a weapon against her during this acrimonious
      episode at breakfast, and he had no conscious intention of
      hanging it, like Damocles' sword over her head, in case she
      pursued her critical and carping course against Millie. But
      whatever he had said last night, she had done that. Without
      meaning to make use of his knowledge, he knew it was in his
      power to do so. What would not Mrs. Altham, for instance,
      give to be informed by an eye-witness that Mrs. Ames had
      blown--it was no more than that--on the abhorred weed? So,
      conscious of a position that he could make offensive at
      will, he accepted the olive branch, and suggested a cold
      curry for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast at Mrs. Altham's reflected less complicated
      conditions of mind. Both she and her husband were extremely
      pleased with themselves, and in a state of passion with
      regard to everybody else. Since their attitude was typical
      of the view that Riseborough generally took of last night's
      festivity, it may be given compendiously in a rhetorical
      flight of Mrs. Altham's, with which her husband was in
      complete accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      In palliation, it may be mentioned that they had both
      partaken of large quantities of food at an unusual hour. It
      is through the body that the entry is made by the subtle
      gateways of the soul, and vitriolic comments in the morning
      are often the precise equivalent of unusual indulgence the
      night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm sure if I had known," said Mrs. Altham, "I
      should not have taken the trouble I did. Of course,
      everybody said 'How lovely your dress is,' simply to make
      one say the same to them. And I never want to hear the word
      Cleopatra again, Henry, so pray don't repeat it. Fancy Mrs.
      Ames appearing as Cleopatra, and us taking the trouble to
      say we were Antony and Cleopatra ten years later! Twenty
      years before would have been more the date if we had known.
      Perhaps I am wrong, but when a woman arrives at Mrs. Ames'
      time of life, whether she dyes her hair or not, she is
      wiser to keep her feet concealed, not to mention what she
      must have looked like in the face of half the tradesmen of
      Riseborough who were lining the pavements when she stepped
      out of her cab. I thought I heard a great roar of laughter
      as we were driving up the High Street; I should not wonder
      if it was the noise of them all laughing as she got out of
      her carriage. Of course, it was all very prettily done, as
      far as poor Mrs. Evans was concerned, but I wonder that Dr.
      Evans likes her to spend money like that, for, however
      unsuitable the supper was, I feel sure it was very
      expensive, for it was all truffles and aspic. There must
      have been a sirloin of beef in the cup of soup I took
      between two of the dances, and strong soup like that at
      dead of night fills one up dreadfully. And Mrs. Brooks
      appearing as another Cleopatra, after all I had said about
      Hermione! Well, I'm sure if she chooses to make a silly of
      herself like that, it is nobody's concern but hers. She
      looked like nothing so much as a great white mare with the
      staggers. If you are going up to the club, Henry, I should
      not wonder if I came out with you. It seems to me a very
      stuffy morning, and a little fresh air would do me good. As
      for the big German ruby in your cap, I don't believe a soul
      noticed it. They were all looking at Mrs. Evans' long white
      arms. Poor thing, she is probably very anmic; I never saw
      such pallor. I saw little of her the whole evening. She
      seemed to be popping in and out of the shrubbery like a
      rabbit all the time with Major Ames. I should not wonder if
      Mrs. Ames was giving him a good talking-to at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, like all the rest of Riseborough, and unlike the
      scorpion, there was a blessing instead of a sting in her
      tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But certainly it was all very pretty," she said; "though
      it all seemed very strange at the time. I can hardly
      believe this morning that we were all dressed up like that,
      hopping about out of doors. Fancy dress balls are very
      interesting; you see so much of human nature, and though I
      looked the procession up and down, Henry, I saw nobody so
      well dressed as you. But I suppose there is a lot of
      jealousy everywhere. And anyhow, Mrs. Evans has quite
      ousted Mrs. Ames now. Nobody will talk about anything but
      last night for the next fortnight, and I'm sure that when
      Mrs. Ames had the conjurer who turned the omelette into the
      watch, we had all forgotten about it three days afterwards.
      And after all, Mrs. Evans is a very pleasant and hospitable
      woman, and I wouldn't have missed that party for anything.
      If you hear anything at the club about her wanting to sell
      her Chinese lanterns and fairy-lights second-hand, Henry,
      or if you find any reason to believe that she had hired
      them out for the night from the Mercantile Stores, you
      might ask the price, and if it is reasonable get a couple
      of dozen. If the weather continues as hot as this we might
      illuminate the garden when we give our August dinner-party.
      At least, I suppose Mrs. Evans does not consider that she
      has a monopoly of lighting up gardens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry found himself quite in accord with the spirit of this
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will remember, my dear," he said; "if I hear anything
      said at the club. I shall go up there soon, for I should
      not be surprised if most of the members spent their morning
      there. I think I will have another cup of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have had two already," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was feeling a little irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then this will make three," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans, finally, had breakfast in her room. When she
      came downstairs, she found that her husband had already
      left the house on his visits, which was a relief. She felt
      that if she had seen his cheerful smiling face this
      morning, she would almost have hated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ordered dinner, and then went out into the garden.
      Workmen were already there, removing the dancing-floor, and
      her gardener was collecting the fairy-lights in trays, and
      carrying them indoors. Here and there were charred, burnt
      places on the grass, and below the mulberry-tree the
      <i>dbris</i> of supper had not yet been removed. But the
      shrubbery, as last night, was sequestered and cool, and she
      sat for an hour there on the garden bench overlooking the
      lawn. Little flakes of golden sunlight filtered down
      through the foliage, and a laburnum, delicate-sprayed,
      oscillated in the light breeze. She scarcely knew whether
      she was happy or not, and she gave no thought to that. But
      she felt more consciously alive than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Discussion about the fancy dress ball, as Mrs Altham had
      said, was paramount over all other topics for at least a
      fortnight after the event, and the great question which
      annually became of such absorbing interest during
      July--namely, as to where to spend August, was dwarfed and
      never attained to its ordinary proportions till quite late
      on in the month. These discussions did not, as a rule, bear
      fruit of any kind, since, almost without exception,
      everybody spent August exactly where August had been spent
      by him for the last dozen years or so, but it was clearly
      wise to consider the problem afresh every year, and be
      prepared, in case some fresh resort suggested itself, to
      change the habit of years, or at least to consider doing
      so. The lists of hotels at the end of Bradshaw, and little
      handbooks published by the South-Eastern Railway were, as a
      rule, almost the only form of literature indulged in during
      these evenings of July, and Mr. Altham, whose imagination
      was always fired by pictures of ships, often studied the
      sailings of River Plate steamers, and considered that the
      fares were very reasonable, especially steerage. The fact
      that he was an appalling bad sailor in no way diminished
      the zest with which he studied their sailings and the
      prices thereof. Subsequently he and Mrs. Altham always
      spent August at Littlestone-on-Sea, in a completely
      detached villa called Blenheim, where a capable
      Scotchwoman, who, to add colour to the illusion, maintained
      that her name really was Churchill, boarded and lodged them
      on solid food and feather beds. During July, it may be
      remarked, Mrs. Altham usually contrived to quarrel with her
      cook, who gave notice. Thus there was one mouth less to
      feed while they were away, and yearly, on their return,
      they had the excitement of new and surprising confections
      from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames, it may be remembered, had already enjoyed a
      fortnight's holiday at Overstrand this year, and the last
      week of July saw her still disinclined to make holiday
      plans. They had taken a sort of bungalow near Deal for the
      last year or two, which, among other advantages, was built
      in such a manner that any remark made in any part of the
      house could be heard in any other part of the house. It was
      enough almost for her to say, as she finished dressing, "We
      are ready for breakfast," to hear Parker replying from the
      kitchen, "The kettle's just on the boil, ma'am." This year,
      however, she had been late in inquiring whether it was
      vacant for August, and she found, when her belated letter
      was answered, that it was already engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact she broke to her husband and Harry, who had
      returned from Cambridge with hair unusually wild and lank,
      with tempered indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Considering how many years we have taken it," she said, "I
      must say that I think they should have told us before
      letting it over our heads like this. But I always thought
      that Mrs. Mackenzie was a most grasping sort of person who
      would be likely to take the first offer that turned up, and
      I'm sure the house was never very comfortable. I have no
      doubt we can easily find a better without much bother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bedroom ceiling always leaked," said Harry; "and there
      was nowhere to write at!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames had finished her breakfast and got up. She felt
      faintly in her mind that after the fancy dress ball it was
      time for her to do something original. Yet the whole idea
      was so novel. . . . Riseborough would be sure to say that
      they had not been able to afford a holiday. But, after all,
      that mattered very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know why we always take the trouble to go
      away to an uncomfortable lodging during August," she said,
      "and leave our own comfortable house standing vacant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames, had he been a horse, would have pricked up his
      ears at this. But the human ear being unadapted to such
      movements, he contented himself with listening avidly. He
      had seen little of Millie this last fortnight, and was
      beginning to realize how much he missed her presence.
      Between them, it is true, they had come near to an intimacy
      which had its dangers, which he really feared more than he
      desired, but he felt, with that self-deception that comes
      so easily to those who know nothing about themselves, that
      he was on his guard now. Meantime, he missed her, and
      guessed quite truly that she missed him. And, poor prig, he
      told himself that he had no right to cut off that which
      gave her pleasure. He could be Spartan over his own
      affairs, if so minded, but he must not play Lycurgus to
      others. And an idea that had privately occurred to him,
      which at the time seemed incapable of realization, suddenly
      leaped into the possible horizons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you always complain of the dampness of strange houses,
      Lyndhurst," she added; "and as Harry says, he has no place
      for writing and study. Why should we go away at all? I am
      sure, after the excitement of the last month, it would be a
      complete rest to remain here when everybody else is gone. I
      have not had a moment to myself this last month, and I
      should not be at all sorry to stop quietly here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames knew with sufficient accuracy the influence he
      had over his wife. He realized, that is to say, as far as
      regarded the present instance, that slight opposition on
      his part usually produced a corresponding firmness on hers.
      Accentuated opposition produced various results; sometimes
      he won, sometimes she. But mild remonstrance always
      confirmed her views in opposition to his. He had a plan of
      his own on this occasion, and her determination to remain
      in Riseborough would prove to be in alliance with it.
      Therefore he mildly remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would regret it before the month was out," he said.
      "For me, I'm an old campaigner, and I hope I can make
      myself comfortable anywhere. But you would get bored before
      the end of August, Amy, and when you get bored your
      digestion is invariably affected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to stop in Riseborough," said Harry. "I hate
      the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will go wherever your mother settles to go, my boy,"
      said Major Ames, still pursuing his plan. "If she wishes to
      go to Sheffield for August, you and I will go too, and--and
      no doubt learn something useful about cutlery. But don't
      try stopping in Riseborough, my dear Amy. At least, if you
      take my advice, you won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames was not very intelligent, but the highest
      intelligence could not have done better. He had learned the
      trick of slight opposition, just as a stupid dog with a
      Conservative master can learn to growl for Asquith by
      incessant repetition. When it has learned it, it does it
      right. The Major had done it right on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not see why Harry should not have a voice in the
      question of where we spend his vacation," she said.
      "Certainly your room at the bungalow, Lyndhurst, was
      comfortable enough, but that was the only decent room in
      the house. In any case we cannot get the bungalow for this
      August. Have you any other plans as to where we should go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was room for a little more of his policy of
      opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now, Brighton," he said. "Why not Brighton? There's
      a club there; I dare say I should get a little Bridge in
      the evening, and no doubt you would pick up some
      acquaintances, Amy. I think the Westbournes went there last
      year."
    </p>
    <p>
      This remarkable reason for going to Brighton made Mrs. Ames
      almost epigrammatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then we could go on to Margate," she remarked, "and
      curry favour there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means, my dear," said he. "I dare say the curry
      would be quite inexpensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames opened the door on to the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray let me know, Lyndhurst," she said, "if you have any
      serious proposition to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Major Ames' custom to start work in the garden
      immediately after breakfast, but this morning he got out
      one of his large-sized cheroots instead (these conduced to
      meditation), and established himself in a chair on the
      verandah. His mental development was not, in most regards,
      of a very high or complex order, but he possessed that
      rather rare attainment of being able to sit down and think
      about one thing to the exclusion of others. With most of us
      to sit down and think about one thing soon resolves itself
      into a confused survey of most other things; Major Ames
      could do better than that, for he could, and on this
      occasion did exclude all other topics from his mind, and at
      the end return, so to speak, "bringing his sheaves with
      him." He had made a definite and reasonable plan.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had communicated the interesting fact of his passion
      for Mrs. Evans to the Omar Khayyam Club, and was, of
      course, bound to prosecute his nefarious intrigue. He had
      already written several galloping lyrics, a little loose in
      grammar and rhyme, to his enchantress, which he had copied
      into a small green morocco note-book, the title-page of
      which he had inscribed as "Dedicated to M. E." This looked
      a Narcissus-like proceeding to any one who did not remember
      what Mrs. Evans' initials were. This afternoon, feeling the
      poetic afflatus blowing a gale within him, but having
      nothing definite to say, he decided to call on the inspirer
      of his muse, in order to gather fresh fuel for his fire.
      Arrayed in a very low collar, which showed the full extent
      of his rather scraggy neck, and adorned with a red tie, for
      socialism was no less an orthodoxy in the club than
      atheistic principles and illicit love, he set secretly out,
      and had the good fortune to find the goddess alone, and was
      welcomed with that rather timid, childlike deference that
      he had found so adorable before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how good of you to come and see me," she said, "when
      I'm sure you must have so many friends wanting you. I think
      it is so kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly she was timid; she did not know her power. Her eyes
      were bluer than ever; her hair was of palest gold, "As I
      remembered her of old," he thought to himself, referring to
      the evening at the end of June. Indeed, there was a poem
      dated June 28, rather a daring one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The kindness is entirely on your side," he said, "in
      letting me come, and"--he longed to say--"worship," but did
      not quite dare--"and have tea with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, that is a selfish sort of kindness," she said.
      "Let us go into the garden. I think it was very unkind of
      you, Mr. Harry, not to come to my dance last week. But of
      course you Cambridge men have more serious things to think
      about than little country parties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought about nothing else but your dance for days,"
      said he; "but my tutor simply refused to let me come down
      for it. A narrow, pedantic fellow, who I don't suppose ever
      danced. Tell me about your dress; I like to picture you in
      a fancy dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help appearing to wish to attract. It was as
      much the fault of the way her head was set on to her neck,
      of the colour of her eyes, as of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, quite a simple white frock," she said; "and a few
      pearls. They--they wanted me to go as Cleopatra. So
      silly--me with a grown-up daughter. But my husband
      insisted."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fancy dress ball had not been talked about at Mrs.
      Ames' lately, and he had heard nothing about it in the two
      days he had been at home. Both his parents had reason for
      letting it pass into the region of things that are done
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did mother and father go?" he asked. "I suppose they felt
      too old to dress up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. They came as Antony and Cleopatra. Have they not
      told you? Cousin Amy looked so--so interesting. And your
      father was splendid as Mark Antony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then was Dr. Evans Mark Antony too?" asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he was Timon of Athens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then who was your Mark Antony?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans felt herself flushing, and her annoyance at
      herself made her awkward in the pouring out of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that Harry's narrow, gimlet-like eyes were fixed
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See how stupid I am," she said. "I have spilled your tea
      in the saucer. Dear Mr. Harry, we had heaps of Cleopatras:
      Mrs. Altham was one, Mrs. Brooks was another. We danced
      with Hamlets, and--and anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      But this crude, ridiculous youth, she felt, had some idea
      in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did father and mother dance together all the evening?"
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt herself growing impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. Everybody danced with everybody. We had
      quadrilles; all sorts of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the mistaken instinct that makes us cautious in
      the wrong place, she determined to say a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your father was so kind to me," she said. "He helped
      me with all the arrangements. I could never have managed it
      except for him. We had tremendous days of talking and
      planning about it. Now tell me all about Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harry was scenting a sonnet of the most remarkable
      character. It might be called The Rivals, and would deal
      with a situation which the Omar Khayyam Club would
      certainly feel to be immensely "parful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose mother helped you, too?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Byronic, lacerating. She had to suffer as well as
      he . . . there was a pungent line already complete. "But
      who had suffered as much as me?" was the refrain. There
      were thrills in store for the Omar Khayyam Club. After a
      sufficiency of yellow wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin Amy was away," said Mrs. Evans. "She was staying at
      Cromer till just before my little dance. That is not far
      from Cambridge, is it? I suppose she came over to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry spared her, and did not press these questions. But
      enough had been said to show that she had broken faith with
      him. "Rivals" could suitably become quite incoherent
      towards the close. Incoherency was sometimes a great
      convenience, for exclamatory rhymes were not rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoothed the lank hair off his forehead, and tactfully
      changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I suppose you are soon going away now," he said. "I am
      lucky to have seen you at all. We are going to stop here
      all August, I think. My mother does not want to go away.
      Nor do I; not that they either of them care about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans' slight annoyance with him was suddenly merged
      in interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How wise!" she said. "It is so absurd to go to stay
      somewhere uncomfortably instead of remaining comfortably. I
      wish we were doing the same. But my husband always has to
      go to Harrogate for a few weeks. And he likes me to be with
      him. I shall think of you all and envy you stopping here in
      this charming Riseborough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You like it?" asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should I not with so many delightful people being
      friendly to me? Relations too; Cousin Amy, for instance,
      and Major Ames, and, let me see, if Mrs. Ames is my cousin,
      surely you are cousin Harry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry became peculiarly fascinating, and craned his long
      neck forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, leave out the 'cousin,'" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How sweet of you--Harry," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, so to speak, extracted the poison-fangs from the
      projected "Rivals," and six mysterious postcards were
      placed by the author's hand in the pillar-box that evening.
      Each consisted of one mystic sentence. "She calls me by my
      Christian name." By a most convenient circumstance, too apt
      to be considered accidental, there had here come to birth
      an octosyllabic line, of honeyed sweetness and simplicity.
      He was not slow to take advantage of it, and the moon
      setting not long before daybreak saw another completed gem
      of the M. E. series.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans that afternoon, like Major Ames that morning,
      "sat and thought," after Harry had left her. Independently
      of the fact that all admirers, even the weirdest, always
      found welcome in her pale blue eyes, she felt really
      grateful to Harry, for he had given her the information on
      which she based a plan which was quite as sound and simple
      as Major Ames', and was designed to secure the same object.
      Since the night of the fancy dress ball she had only seen
      him once or twice, and never privately, and the greater
      vitality which, by the wondrous processes of affinity, he
      had stirred in her, hungered for its sustenance. It cannot
      be said that she was even now really conscious in herself
      of disloyalty to her husband, or that she actually
      contemplated any breach of faith. She had not at present
      sufficient force of feeling to imagine a decisive
      situation; but she could at most lash her helm, so to
      speak, so that the action of the wind would take her boat
      in the direction in which she wished to go, and then sit
      idly on deck, saying that she was not responsible for the
      course she was pursuing. The wind, the tide, the currents
      were irresistibly impelling her; she had nothing to do with
      the rudder, having tied it, she did not touch it. Like the
      majority in this world of miserable sinners, she did not
      actively court the danger she desired, but she hung about
      expectant of it. At the same time she kept an anxious eye
      on the shore towards which she was driving. Was it really
      coming closer? If so, why did she seem to have made no way
      lately?
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day her plan betokened a more active hand in what she
      thought of as fate, but unfortunately, though it was as
      sound in itself as Major Ames', it was made independently
      and ignorantly of that which had prompted his slight
      opposition this morning, so that, while each plan was
      admirable enough in itself, the two, taken in conjunction,
      would, if successful, result in a fiasco almost sublime in
      its completeness. The manner of which was as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie, it so happened, was not at home that evening, and
      she and her husband dined alone, and strolled out in the
      garden afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will miss your chess this evening, dear," she said.
      "Or would it amuse you to give me a queen and a few bishops
      and knights, and see how long it takes you to defeat me? Or
      shall we spend a little cosy chatty evening together? I
      hope no horrid people will be taken ill, and send for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I, little woman," he said (she was getting to detest
      the appellation). "And as if I shouldn't enjoy a quiet
      evening of talk with you more than fifty games of chess!
      But, dear me, I shall be glad to get away to Harrogate this
      year! I need a month of it badly. I shall positively enjoy
      the foul old rotten-egg smell."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't talk of it," she said. "It is bad enough without
      thinking of it beforehand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little woman! Almost a pity you are not gouty too.
      Then we should both look forward to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on one of the shrubbery seats, and drew aside
      her skirts, making room for him to sit beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but as I am not gouty, Wilfred," she said. "It is no
      use wishing I was. And I do hate Harrogate so. I wonder--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little sigh and put her arm within his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's the little woman wondering now?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly like to tell you. You are always so kind to me
      that I don't know why I am afraid. Wilfred, would you think
      it dreadful of me, if I suggested not going with you this
      year? I'm sure it makes me ill to be there. You will have
      Elsie; you will play chess as usual with her all evening.
      You see all morning you are at your baths, and you usually
      are out bicycling all afternoon with her. I don't think you
      know how I hate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begun in her shy, tentative manner. But her voice
      grew more cold and decided. She put forward her arguments
      like a woman who has thought it all carefully over, as
      indeed she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what will you do with yourself, my dear?" he said. "It
      seems a funny plan. You can't stop here alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up, taking her hand from his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I should not be as lonely here as I am at
      Harrogate," she said. "We don't know anybody there, and if
      you think of it, I am really alone most of the time. It is
      different for you, because it is doing you good, and, as I
      say, you are bicycling with Elsie all the afternoon, and
      you play chess together in the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      A shade of trouble and perplexity came over the doctor's
      face; the indictment, for it was hardly less than that, was
      as well-ordered and digested as if it had been prepared for
      a forensic argument. And the calm, passionless voice went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of my day there," she said, going into orderly
      detail. "After breakfast you go off to your baths, and I
      have to sit in that dreadful sitting-room while they clear
      the things away. Even a hotel would be more amusing than
      those furnished lodgings; one could look at the people
      going in and out. Or if I go for a stroll in the morning, I
      get tired, and must rest in the afternoon. You come in to
      lunch, and go off with Elsie afterwards. That is quite
      right; the exercise is good for you, but what is the use of
      my being there? There is nobody for me to go to see, nobody
      comes to see me. Then we have dinner, and I have the
      excitement of learning where you and Elsie have been
      bicycling. You two play chess after dinner, and I have the
      excitement of being told who has won. Here, at any rate, I
      can sit in a room that doesn't smell of dinner, or I can
      sit in the garden. I have my own books and things about me,
      and there are people I know whom I can see and talk to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, and began walking up and down the path in front
      of the bench where they had been sitting, his kindly soul
      in some perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing wrong, little woman?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not. Why should you think that? I imagine there
      is reason enough in what I have told you. I do get so bored
      there, Wilfred. And I hate being bored. I am sure it is not
      good for me, either. Try to picture my life there, and see
      how utterly different it is from yours. Besides, as I say,
      it is doing you good all the time, and as you yourself
      said, you welcome the thought of that horrible smelling
      water."
    </p>
    <p>
      He still shuffled up and down in the dusk. That, too, got
      on her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray sit down, Wilfred," she said. "Your walking about
      like that confuses me. And surely you can say 'Yes' or 'No'
      to me. If you insist on my going with you, I shall go. But
      I shall think it very unreasonable of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't say 'Yes' or 'No' like that, little woman," he
      said. "I don't imagine you have thought how dull
      Riseborough will be during August. Everybody goes away, I
      believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she thought of telling him that the Ames' were
      going to stop here: then, with entirely misplaced caution,
      she thought wiser to keep that to herself. She, guilty in
      the real reason for wishing to remain here, though coherent
      and logical enough in the account she had given him of her
      reason, thought, grossly wronging him, that some seed of
      suspicion might hereby enter her husband's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is sure to be some one here," she said. "The
      Althams, for instance, do not go away till the middle of
      August."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not particularly care for them," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but they are better than nobody. All day at Harrogate
      I have nobody. It is not companionship to sit in the room
      with you and Elsie playing chess. Besides, the Westbournes
      will be at home. I shall go over there a great deal, I dare
      say. Also I shall be in my own house, which is comfortable,
      and which I am fond of. Our lodgings at Harrogate disgust
      me. They are all oilcloth and plush; there is nowhere to
      sit when they are clearing away."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was still clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is so odd for a married woman to stop alone like
      that," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is far odder for her husband to want her to
      spend a month of loneliness and boredom in lodgings," she
      said. "Because I have never complained, Wilfred, you think
      I haven't detested it. But on thinking it over it seems to
      me more sensible to tell you how I detest it, and ask you
      that I shouldn't go."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, little woman," he said at length. "You shall do
      as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the cold precision of her speech changed. She
      gave that little sigh of conscious content with which she
      often woke in the morning, and linked her arm into his
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that is dear of you," she said. "You are always such a
      darling to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a man to give grudging consents, or spoil a gift
      by offering it except with the utmost cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only hope you'll make a great success of it, little
      woman," he said. "And it must be dull for you at Harrogate.
      So that's settled, and we're all satisfied. Let us see if
      Elsie has come in yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear," she said again.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Evans was neither analytical regarding himself nor
      curious about analysis that might account for the action of
      others. Just as in his professional work he was rather
      old-fashioned, but eminently safe and sensible, so in the
      ordinary conduct of his life he did not seek for abstruse
      causes and subtle motives. It was quite enough for him that
      his wife felt that she would be excruciatingly bored at
      Harrogate, and less acutely desolate here. On the other
      hand, it implied violation of one of the simplest customs
      of life that a wife should be in one place and her husband
      in another. That was vaguely disquieting to him.
      Disquieting also was the cold, precise manner with which
      she had conducted her case. A dozen times only, perhaps, in
      all their married life had she assumed this frozen rigidity
      of demeanour; each time he had succumbed before it. In the
      ordinary way, if their inclinations were at variance, she
      would coax and wheedle him into yielding or, though quietly
      adhering to her own opinion, she would let him have his
      way. But with her calm rigidity, rarely assumed, he had
      never successfully combated; there was a steeliness about
      it that he knew to be stronger than any opposition he could
      bring to it. Nothing seemed to affect it, neither argument
      nor conjugal command. She would go on saying "I do not
      agree with you," in the manner of cool water dripping on a
      stone. Or with the same inexorable quietness she would
      repeat, "I feel very strongly about it: I think it very
      unkind of you." And a sufficiency of that always had
      rendered his opposition impotent: her will, when once
      really aroused, seemed to paralyse his. Once or twice her
      line had turned out conspicuously ill. That seemed to make
      no difference: the cold, precise manner was on higher plane
      than the material failure which had resulted therefrom. She
      would merely repeat, "But it was the best thing to do under
      the circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this instance he wondered a little that she had used
      this manner over a matter that seemed so little vital as
      the question of Harrogate, but by next morning he had
      ceased to concern himself further with it. She was
      completely her usual self again, and soon after breakfast
      set off to accomplish some little errands in the town,
      looking in on him in his laboratory to know if there were
      any commissions she could do for him. His eye at the moment
      was glued to his microscope: a culture of staphylococcus
      absorbed him, and without looking up, he said--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, thanks, little woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her pause: then she came across the room to him,
      and laid her cool hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilfred, you are such a dear to me," she said. "You're not
      vexed with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted his observations, and put his arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vexed?" he said. "I'll tell you when I'm vexed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him, dewily, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, then," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So her plan was accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair of the staphylococcus did not long detain the
      doctor, and presently after Major Ames was announced. He
      had come to consult Dr. Evans with regard to certain gouty
      symptoms into which the doctor inquired and examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing whatever to worry about," he said, after a
      very short investigation. "I should recommend you to cut
      off alcohol entirely, and not eat meat more than once a
      day. A fortnight's dieting will probably cure you. And take
      plenty of exercise. I won't give you any medicine. There is
      no use in taking drugs when you can produce the same effect
      by not taking other things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames fidgeted and frowned a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking," he said at length, "of taking myself more
      thoroughly in hand than that. I've never approved of
      half-measures, and I can't begin now. If a tooth aches have
      it out, and be done with it. No fiddling about for me. Now
      my wife does not want to go away this August, and it seemed
      to me that it would be a very good opportunity for me to
      go, as you do, I think, and take a course of waters. Get
      rid of the tendency, don't you know, eradicate it. What do
      you say to that? Harrogate now; I was thinking of
      Harrogate, if you approved. Harrogate does wonders for
      gout, does it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am certainly hoping that Harrogate will do wonders for
      me," he said. "I go there every year. And no doubt many of
      us who are getting on in years would be benefited by it.
      But your symptoms are very slight. I think you will soon
      get rid of them if you follow the course I suggest."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Major Ames showed a strange desire for Harrogate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I like to do things thoroughly," he said. "I like
      getting rid of a thing root and branch, you know. You see I
      may not get another opportunity. Amy likes me to go with
      her on her holiday in August, but there is no reason why I
      should stop in Riseborough. I haven't spoken to her yet,
      but if I could say that you recommended Harrogate, I'm sure
      she would wish me to go. Indeed, she would insist on my
      going. She is often anxious about my gouty tendencies, more
      anxious, as I often tell her, than she has any need to be.
      But an aunt of hers had an attack which went to her heart
      quite unexpectedly, and killed her, poor thing. I think,
      indeed, it would be a weight off Amy's mind if she knew I
      was going to take myself thoroughly in hand, not tinker and
      peddle about with diet only. So would you be able to
      recommend me to go to Harrogate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A course of Harrogate wouldn't be bad for any of us who
      eat a good dinner every night," said Dr. Evans. "But I
      think that if you tried--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames got up, waving all further discussion aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough, doctor," he said. "If it would do me good,
      I know Amy would wish me to go; you know what wives are.
      Now I'm pressed for time this morning, and so I am sure are
      you. By the way, you needn't mention my plan till I've
      talked it over with Amy. But about lodgings, now. Do you
      recommend lodgings or an hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Evans did not mention that his wife was not going to be
      with him this year, for, having obtained permission to say
      that Harrogate would do him good, Major Ames had developed
      a prodigious hurry, and a few moments after was going
      jauntily home, with the address of Dr. Evans' lodgings in
      his pocket. He trusted to his own powers of exaggeration to
      remove all possible opposition on his wife's part, and felt
      himself the devil of a diplomatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      So his plan was arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third factor in this network of misconceived plots
      occurred the same morning. Mrs. Ames, visiting the High
      Street on account of an advanced melon, met Cousin Millie
      on some similar errand to the butcher's on account of
      advanced cutlets, for the weather was trying. It was
      natural that she announced her intention of remaining in
      Riseborough with her family during August: it was natural
      also that Cousin Millie signified the remission from
      Harrogate. Cousin Amy was cordial on the subject, and
      returned home. Probably she would have mentioned this fact
      to her husband, if he had given her time to do it. But he
      was bursting with a more immediate communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't like to tell you before, Amy," he said, "because
      I didn't want to make you unnecessarily anxious. And
      there's no need for anxiety now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was not very imaginative, but it occurred to her
      that the newly-planted magnolia had not been prospering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No real cause for anxiety," he said. "But the fact is that
      I went to see Dr. Evans this morning--don't be frightened,
      my dear--and got thoroughly overhauled by him, thoroughly
      overhauled. He said there was no reason for anxiety,
      assured me of it. But I'm gouty, my dear, there's no doubt
      of it, and of course you remember about your poor Aunt
      Harriet. Well, there it is. And he says Harrogate. A bore,
      of course, but Harrogate. But no cause for anxiety: he told
      me so twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames gave one moment to calm, clear, oysterlike
      reflection, unhurried, unalarmed. There was no shadow of
      reason why she should tell him what Mrs. Evans' plans were.
      But it was odd that she should suddenly decide to stop in
      Riseborough, instead of going to Harrogate, having heard
      from Harry that the Ames' were to remain at home, and
      Lyndhurst as suddenly be impelled to go to Harrogate,
      instead of stopping in Riseborough. A curious coincidence.
      Everybody seemed to be making plans. At any rate she would
      not add to their number, but only acquiesce in those which
      were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lyndhurst, what an upset!" she said. "Of course,
      if you tell me there is no cause for anxiety, I will not be
      anxious. Does Dr. Evans recommend you to go to Harrogate
      now? You must tell me all he said. They always go in
      August, do they not? That will be pleasant for you. But I
      am afraid you will find the waters far from palatable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames felt that he had not made a sufficiently
      important impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I told Dr. Evans I could decide nothing till I
      had consulted you," he said. "It seems a great break-up to
      leave you and Harry here and go away like this. It was that
      I was thinking of, not whether waters are palatable or not.
      I have more than half a mind not to go. I daresay I shall
      worry through all right without."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs. Ames made a little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must do as Dr. Evans tells you to do," she said. "I am
      sure he is not faddy or fussy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames' experience of him this morning fully endorsed
      this. Certainly he had been neither, whatever the
      difference between the two might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, if both you and Dr. Evans are agreed," he
      said, "I mustn't set myself up against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now did he tell you where to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He gave me the address of his own lodgings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a convenient arrangement! Now, my dear, I beg you to
      waste no time. Send off a telegram, and pay the reply, and
      we'll pack you off to-morrow. I am sure it is the right
      thing to do."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden conviction, painfully real, that he was behaving
      currishly, descended on Major Ames. The feeling was so
      entirely new to him that he would have liked to put it down
      to an obsession of gout in a new place--the conscience, for
      instance, for he could hardly believe that he should be
      self-accused of paltry conduct. He felt as if there must be
      some mistake about it. He almost wished that Amy had made
      difficulties; then there would have been the compensatory
      idea that she was behaving badly too. But she could not
      have conducted herself in a more guilelessly sympathetic
      manner; she seemed to find no inherent improbability in Dr.
      Evans having counselled Harrogate, no question as to the
      advisability of following his advice. It was almost
      unpleasant to him to have things made so pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then this salutary impression was effaced, for anything
      that savoured of self-reproach could not long find
      harbourage in his mind. Instead, he pictured himself at
      Harrogate station, welcoming the Evans'. She would probably
      be looking rather tired and fragile after the journey, but
      he would have a cab ready for her, and tea would be
      awaiting them when they reached the lodgings. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c09" id="c09">CHAPTER IX</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A week later Mrs. Ames was sitting at breakfast, with Harry
      opposite her, expecting the early post, and among the gifts
      of the early post a letter from her husband. He had written
      one very soon after his arrival at Harrogate, saying that
      he felt better already. The waters, as Amy had conjectured,
      could not be described as agreeable, since their
      composition chiefly consisted of those particular
      ingredients which gave to rotten eggs their characteristic
      savour, but what, so said the valiant, did a bad taste in
      the mouth matter, if you knew it was doing you good? An
      excellent band encouraged the swallowing of this
      disagreeable fluid, and by lunch-time baths and drinking
      were over for the day. He was looking forward to the Evans'
      arrival; it would be pleasant to see somebody he knew. He
      would write again before many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The post arrived; there was a letter for her in the Major's
      large sprawling handwriting, and she opened it. But it was
      scarcely a letter: a blister of expletives covered the
      smoking pages . . . and the Evans'--two of them--had
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames' little toadlike face seldom expressed much more
      than a ladylike composure, but had Harry been watching his
      mother he might have thought that a shade of amusement
      hovered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter from your father," she said. "Rather a worried
      letter. The cure is lowering, I believe, and makes you feel
      out of sorts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was looking rather yellow and dishevelled. He had sat
      up very late the night before, and the chase for rhymes had
      been peculiarly fatiguing and ineffectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't feel at all well, either," he said. "And I don't
      think Cousin Millie is well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Mrs. Ames composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went to see her yesterday and she didn't attend. She
      seemed frightfully surprised to hear that father had gone
      to Harrogate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose Dr. Evans had not told her," remarked Mrs. Ames.
      "Please telephone to her after breakfast, Harry, and ask
      her to dine with us this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. How curious women are! One day they seem so glad to
      see you, another you are no more to them than foam on a
      broken wave."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of the fragments of last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On a broken what?" asked Mrs. Ames. The rustling of the
      turning leaf of the <i>Morning Post</i> had caused her not
      to hear. There was no sarcastic intention in her inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not matter," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should take a little dose, dear," she said, "if you feel
      like that. The heat upsets us all at times. Will you please
      telephone now, Harry? Then I shall know what to order for
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames' nature was undeniably a simple one; she had no
      misty profundities or curious dim-lit clefts on the round,
      smooth surface of her life, but on occasion simple natures
      are capable of curious complexities of feeling, the more
      elusive because they themselves are unable to register
      exactly what they do feel. Certainly she saw a connection
      between the non-arrival of dear Millie at Harrogate and the
      inflamed letter from her husband. She had suspected also a
      connection between dear Millie's decision to spend August
      at Riseborough and her belief that Major Ames was going to
      do so too. But the completeness of the fiasco sucked the
      sting out of the resentment she might otherwise have felt:
      it was impossible to be angry with such sorry conspirators.
      At the same time, with regard to her husband, she felt the
      liveliest internal satisfaction at his blistering
      communication, and read it through again. The thought of
      her own slighted or rather unperceived rejuvenescence added
      point to this; she felt that he had been "served out." Not
      for a moment did she suspect him of anything but the most
      innocent of flirtations, and she was disposed to credit
      dear Millie with having provoked such flirtation as there
      was. By this time also it must have been quite clear to
      both the thwarted parties that she was in full cognizance
      of their futile designs; clearly, therefore, her own
      <i>beau rle</i> was to appear utterly unconscious of it
      all, and, unconsciously, to administer nasty little jabs to
      each of them with a smiling face. "They have been making
      sillies of themselves," expressed her indulgent verdict on
      the whole affair. Then in some strange feminine way she
      felt a sort of secret pride in her husband for having had
      the manhood to flirt, however mildly, with somebody else's
      wife; but immediately there followed the resentment that he
      had not shown any tendency to flirt with his own, when she
      had encouraged him. But, anyhow, he had chosen the
      prettiest woman in Riseborough, and he was the handsomest
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her mood changed; the thought at any rate of
      administering some nasty little jabs presented itself in a
      growingly attractive light. The two sillies had been
      wanting to dance to their own tune; they should dance to
      hers instead, and by way of striking up her own tune at
      once she wrote as follows, to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "MY DEAREST LYNDHURST,<br>
      <br>
      "I can't tell you how glad I was to get your two letters,
      and to know how much good Harrogate is doing you. What an
      excellent thing that you went to Dr. Evans (please remember
      me to him), and that he insisted so strongly on your taking
      yourself thoroughly in hand."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, wondering exactly how strong this
      insistence had been. It was possible that it was not very
      strong. So much the more reason for letting the sentence
      stand. She now underlined the words "so strongly."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Of course the waters are disgusting to take, and I declare
      I can almost smell them when I read your vivid description,
      but, as you said in your first letter, what is a bad taste
      in the mouth when you know it is doing you good? And your
      second letter convinces me how right you were to go, and
      when things like gout begin to come out, it naturally makes
      you feel a little low and worried. I want you to stop there
      the whole of August, and get thoroughly rid of it.<br>
      <br>
      "Here we are getting along very happily, and I am so glad I
      did not go to the sea. Millie is here, as you will know,
      and we see a great deal of her. She is constantly dropping
      in, <i>en fille,</i> I suppose you would call it, and is in
      excellent spirits and looks so pretty. But I am not quite
      at ease about Harry (this is private). He is very much
      attracted by her, and she seems to me not very wise in the
      way she deals with him, for she seems to be encouraging him
      in his silliness. Perhaps I will speak to her about it, and
      yet I hardly like to."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs. Ames paused: she had no idea she had such a
      brilliant touch in the administration of these jabs. What
      she said might not be strictly accurate, but it was full of
      point.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "I remember, too, what you said, that it was so good for a
      boy to be taken up with a thoroughly nice woman, and that
      it prevented his getting into mischief, I am sure Harry is
      writing all sorts of poems to her, because he sighs a great
      deal, and has a most inky forefinger, for which I give him
      pumice-stone. But if she were not so nice a woman, and so
      far from anything like flirtatiousness, I should feel
      myself obliged to speak to Harry and warn him. She seems
      very happy and cheerful. I daresay she feels like me, and
      is rejoiced to think that Harrogate is doing her husband
      good.<br>
      <br>
      "Write to me soon again, my dear, and give me another
      excellent account of yourself. Was it not queer that you
      settled to go to Harrogate just when Millie settled not to?
      If you were not such good friends, one would think you
      wanted to avoid each other! Well, I must stop. Millie is
      dining with us, and I must order dinner."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She read through what she had written with considerable
      content. "That will be nastier than the Harrogate waters,"
      she thought to herself, "and quite as good for him." And
      then, with a certain largeness which lurked behind all her
      littlenesses, she practically dismissed the whole silly
      business from her mind. But she continued the use of the
      purely natural means for restoring the colour of the hair,
      and tapped and dabbed the corners of her eyes with the
      miraculous skin-food. That was a prophylactic measure; she
      did not want to appear "a fright" when Lyndhurst came back
      from Harrogate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was well aware that the famous fancy dress ball
      had caused her a certain loss of prestige in her capacity
      of queen of society in Riseborough. It had followed close
      on the heels of her innovation of asking husbands and wives
      separately to dinner, and had somewhat taken the shine out
      of her achievement, and indeed this latter had not been as
      epoch-making as she had expected. For the last week or two
      she had felt that something new was required of her, but as
      is often the case, she found that the recognition of such a
      truth does not necessarily lead to the discovery of the
      novelty. Perhaps the paltriness of Lyndhurst's conduct,
      leading to reflections on her own superior wisdom, put her
      on the path, for about this time she began to take a
      renewed interest in the Suffragette movement which, from
      what she saw in the papers, was productive of such
      adventurous alarums in London. For herself, she was
      essentially law-abiding by nature, and though, in
      opposition to Lyndhurst, sympathetically inclined to women
      who wanted the vote, she had once said that to throw stones
      at Prime Ministers was unladylike in itself, and only drew
      on the perpetrators the attention of the police to
      themselves, rather than the attention of the public to the
      problem. But a recrudescence of similar acts during the
      last summer had caused her to wonder whether she had said
      quite the last word on the subject, or thought the last
      thought. Certainly the sensational interest in such violent
      acts had led her to marvel at the strength of feeling that
      prompted them. Ladies, apparently, whose breeding--always a
      word of potency with Mrs. Ames--she could not question,
      were behaving like hooligans. The matter interested her in
      itself apart from its possible value as a novelty for the
      autumn. Also an election was probably to take place in
      November. Hitherto that section of Riseborough in which she
      lived had not suffered its tranquillity to be interrupted
      by political excitements, but like a man in his sleep,
      drowsily approved a Conservative member. But what if she
      took the lead in some political agitation, and what if she
      introduced a Suffragette element into the election? That
      was a solider affair than that a quantity of Cleopatras
      should skip about in a back garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had always felt a certain interest in the movement, but
      it was the desire to make a novelty for the autumn,
      peppered, so to speak, by an impatience at the futile
      treachery of her husband's Harrogate plans, and an ambition
      to take a line of her own in opposition to him, that
      presented their crusade in a serious light to her. The
      militant crusaders she had hitherto regarded as affected by
      a strange lunacy, and her husband's masculine comment,
      "They ought to be well smacked, by Jove!" had had the ring
      of common-sense, especially since he added, for the benefit
      of such crusaders as were of higher social rank, "They're
      probably mad, poor things."
    </p>
    <p>
      But during this tranquil month of August her more serious
      interest was aroused, and she bought, though furtively,
      such literature in the form of little tracts and addresses
      as was accessible on the subject. And slowly, though still
      the desire for an autumn novelty that would eclipse the
      memory of the congregations of Cleopatras was a moving
      force in her mind, something of the real ferment began to
      be yeasty within her, and she learned by private inquiry
      what the Suffragette colours were. Naturally the
      introduction of an abstract idea into her mind was a
      laborious process, since her life had for years consisted
      of an endless chain of small concrete events, and had been
      lived among people who had never seen an abstract idea
      wild, any more than they had seen an elephant in a real
      jungle. It was always tamed and eating buns, as in the Zoo,
      just as other ideas reached them peptonized by the columns
      of daily papers. But a wild thing lurked behind the
      obedient trunk; a wild thing lurked behind the reports of
      ludicrous performances in the Palace Yard at Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      August was still sultry, and Major Ames was still at
      Harrogate, when one evening she and Harry dined with
      Millie. Since nothing of any description happened in
      Riseborough during this deserted month, the introductory
      discussion of what events had occurred since they last met
      in the High Street that morning was not possible of great
      expansion. None of them had seen the aeroplane which was
      believed to have passed over the town in the afternoon, and
      nobody had heard from Mrs. Altham. Then Mrs. Ames fired the
      shot which was destined to involve Riseborough in smoke and
      brimstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lyndhurst and I," she said, "have never agreed about the
      Suffragettes, and now that I know something about them, I
      disagree more than ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie looked slightly shocked: she thought of Suffragettes
      as she thought of the persons who figure in police news.
      Indeed, they often did. She knew they wanted to vote about
      something, but that was practically all she knew except
      that they expressed their desire to vote by hitting people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about them," she said. "But are they not
      very unladylike?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are a disgrace to their sex," said Harry. "We soon
      made them get out of Cambridge! They tried to hold a
      meeting in the backs, but I and a few others went down
      there, and--well, there wasn't much more heard of them. I
      don't call them women at all. I call them females."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames had excellent reasons for suspecting romance in
      her son's account of his exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me exactly what happened in the backs at Cambridge,
      Harry," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry slightly retracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing much to tell," he said. "Our club felt
      bound to make a protest, and we went down there, as I said.
      It seemed to cow them a bit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then did the proctors come and cow you?" asked his
      inexorable mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe a proctor did come; I did not wait for that.
      They made a perfect fiasco, anyhow. They told me it was all
      a dead failure, and we heard no more about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that was all?" said Mrs. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And quite enough. I agree with father. They disgrace their
      sex!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you know as little about it as your father," she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely a man's judgment--" said Millie, making weak
      eyes at Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Millie, a man's judgment is not of any value, if he
      does not know anything about what he is judging. We have
      all read accounts in the papers, and heard that they are
      very violent and chain themselves up to inconvenient places
      like railings, and are taken away by policemen. Sometimes
      they slap the policemen, but surely there must be something
      behind that makes them like that. I am finding out what it
      is. It is all most interesting. They say that they have to
      pay their rates and taxes, but get no privileges. If a man
      pays rates and taxes he gets a vote, and why shouldn't a
      woman? It is all very well expressed. They seem to me to
      reason just as well as a man. I mean to find out much more
      about it all. Personally I don't pay rates and taxes,
      because that is Lyndhurst's affair, but if we had arranged
      differently and I paid for the house and the rates and
      taxes, why shouldn't I have a vote instead of him? And from
      what I can learn the gardener has a vote, just the same as
      Lyndhurst, although Lyndhurst does all the garden-rolling,
      and won't let Parkins touch the flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It all seems very confused and upside down," she said. "Do
      smoke, Harry, if you feel inclined. Will you have a
      cigarette, Cousin Amy? I am afraid I have none. I never
      smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was a little sore from his mother's handling, and was
      not unwilling to hit back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew mother smoked," he said. "Do you smoke,
      mother? How delightful! How Eastern! I never knew you were
      Eastern. I always thought you said it was not wicked for
      women to smoke, but only horrid. Do be horrid. I am sure
      Suffragettes smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames turned a swift appealing eye on Millie,
      entreating confidence. Then she lied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Millie, what are you thinking of?" she said. "Of
      course I never smoke, Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the appeal of the eyes had not taken effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But on the night of my little dance, Cousin Amy," she
      said, "surely you had a cigarette. It made you cough, and
      you said how nice it was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames wished she had not been so ruthless about the
      Suffragettes at Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a great difference between doing a thing once,"
      she said, "and making a habit of it. I think I did want to
      see what it was like, but I never said it was nice, and as
      for its being Eastern, I am sure I am glad to belong to the
      West. I always thought it unfeminine, and then I knew it. I
      did not feel myself again till I had brushed my teeth and
      rinsed my mouth. Now, dear Millie, I am really interested
      in the Suffragettes. Their demands are reasonable, and if
      we are unreasonable about granting them, they must be
      unreasonable too. For years they have been reasonable and
      nobody has paid any attention to them. What are they to do
      but be violent, and call attention to themselves? It is all
      so well expressed; you cannot fail to be interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilfred would never let me hit a policeman," said Millie.
      "And I don't think I could do it, even if he wanted me to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is not the aim of the movement to hit policemen,"
      said Mrs. Ames. "They are very sorry to have to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are sorrier afterwards," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames turned a small, withering eye upon her offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had waited to hear what they had to say instead of
      running away before the proctor came," she said, "you might
      have learnt a little about them, dear. They are not at all
      sorry afterwards; they go to prison quite cheerfully, in
      the second division, too, which is terribly uncomfortable.
      And many of them have been brought up as luxuriously as any
      of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not go to prison," said Mrs. Evans faintly, but
      firmly. "And even if I could, it would be very wrong of me,
      for I am sure it would injure Wilfred's practice. People
      would not like to go to a doctor whose wife had been in
      prison. She might have caught something. And Elsie would be
      so ashamed of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames gave the suppressed kind of sigh which was
      habitual with her when Lyndhurst complained that the water
      for his bath was not hot, although aware that the kitchen
      boiler was being cleaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you need not go to prison in order to be a
      Suffragette, dear Millie," she said. "Prison life is not
      one of the objects of the movement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans looked timidly apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know," she said. "It is so interesting to be
      told. I thought all the brave sort went to prison, and had
      breakfast together when they were let out. I am sure I have
      read about their having breakfast together."
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile quivered on her mouth. She was aware that
      Cousin Amy thought her very stupid, and there was a
      delicate pleasure in appearing quite idiotic like this. It
      made Cousin Amy dance with irritation in her inside, and
      explain more carefully yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Millie," she said, "but their having breakfast
      together has not much to do with their objects--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that," said Harry; "there is a club at
      Cambridge to which I belong, whose object is to dine
      together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is very greedy of you, dear," said Mrs. Ames, "and
      the Suffragettes are not like that. They go to prison and
      do all sorts of unladylike things for the sake of their
      convictions. They want to be treated justly. For years they
      have asked for justice, and nobody has paid the least
      attention to them; now they are making people attend. I
      assure you that until I began reading about them, I had
      very little sympathy with them. But now I feel that all
      women ought to know about them. Certainly what I have read
      has opened my eyes very much, and there are a quantity of
      women of very good family indeed who belong to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry pulled his handkerchief out of the sleeve of his
      dress-coat; he habitually kept it there. Just now the Omar
      Khayyam Club was rather great on class distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not see what that matters," he said. "Because a man's
      great-grandmother was created a duchess for being a king's
      mistress--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans and Mrs. Ames got up simultaneously; if anything
      Mrs. Ames got up a shade first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think we need go into that, Harry," said Mrs.
      Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie tempered the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you join us soon, Harry?" she said. "If you are too
      long I shall come and fetch you. We have been political
      to-night! Will it be too cold for you in the garden, Cousin
      Amy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Harry devoted several minutes' pitiful
      reflection to his mother's state of mind. In spite of her
      awakened interest in the Suffragette movement, she seemed
      to him deplorably old-fashioned. But with his second glass
      of port his thoughts assumed a rosier tone, and he
      determined to wait till Cousin Millie came to fetch him.
      Surely she meant him to do that: no doubt she wanted to
      have just one private word with him. She had often caught
      his eye during dinner, with a deprecating look, as if to
      say this tiresome rigmarole about Suffragettes was not her
      fault. He felt they understood each other. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a large Chippendale looking-glass above the
      sideboard, and he got up from the table and observed the
      upper part of his person which was reflected in it. A wisp
      of hair fell over his forehead; it might more rightly be
      called a plume. He appeared to himself to have a most
      interesting face, uncommon, arresting. He was interestingly
      and characteristically dressed, too, with a collar
      Byronically low, a soft frilled shirt, and in place of a
      waistcoat a black cummerbund. Then hastily he mounted on a
      chair in order to see the whole of his lean figure that
      seemed so slender. It was annoying that at this moment of
      critical appreciation a parlour-maid should look in to see
      if she could clear away. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing that so confirms individualism in any
      character as periods of comparative solitude. In men such
      confirmation is liable to be checked by the boredom to
      which their sex is subject, but women, less frequently the
      prey of this paralysing emotion, when the demands made upon
      them by household duties and domestic companionship are
      removed, enter very swiftly into the kingdoms of
      themselves. This process was very strongly at work just now
      with Millie Evans; superficially, her composure and
      meaningless smoothness were unaltered, so that Mrs. Ames,
      at any rate, almost wondered whether she had been right in
      crediting her with any hand in the Harrogate plans, so
      unruffled was her insipid and deferential cordiality, but
      down below she was exploring herself and discovering a
      capacity for feeling that astonished her by its intensity.
      All her life she had been content to arouse emotion without
      sharing it, liking to see men attentive to her, liking to
      see them attracted by her and disposed towards tenderness.
      They were more interesting like that, and she gently basked
      in the warmth of their glow, like a lizard on the wall. She
      had not wanted more than that; she was lizard, not vampire,
      and to sun herself on the wall, and then glide gently into
      a crevice again, seemed quite sufficient exercise for her
      emotions. Luckily or unluckily (those who hold that calm
      and complete respectability is the aim of existence would
      prefer the former adverb, those who think that development
      of individuality is worth the risk of a little scorching,
      the latter) she had married a man who required little or
      nothing more than she was disposed to give. He had not
      expected unquiet rapture, but a comfortable home with a
      "little woman" always there, good-tempered, as Millie was,
      and cheerful and pliable as, with a dozen exceptions when
      the calm precision came into play, she had always been.
      Temperamentally, he was nearly as undeveloped as she, and
      the marriage had been what is called a very sensible one.
      But such sensible marriages ignore the fact that human
      beings, like the shores of the bay of Naples, are
      periodically volcanic, and the settlers there assume that
      their little property, because no sulphurous signs have
      appeared on the surface, is essentially quiescent,
      neglecting the fact that at one time or another emotional
      disturbances are to be expected. But because many quiet
      years have passed undisturbed, they get to believe that the
      human and natural fires have ceased to smoulder, and are no
      longer alive down below the roots of their pleasant vines
      and olive trees. All her life up till now, Millie Evans had
      been like one of these quiescent estates; now, when
      middle-age was upon her, she began to feel the stir of
      vital forces. The surface of her life was still
      undisturbed, she went about the diminished business of the
      household with her usual care, and in the weeks of this
      solitary August knitted a couple of ties for her husband,
      and read a couple of novels from the circulating library,
      with an interest not more markedly tepid than usual. But
      subterranean stir was going on, though no fire-breathing
      clefts appeared on the surface. Subconsciously she wove
      images and dreams, scarcely yet knowing that it is out of
      such dreams that the events and deeds of life inevitably
      spring. She had scarcely admitted even to herself that her
      projects for August had gone crookedly: the conviction that
      Lyndhurst Ames had found himself gouty and in need of
      Harrogate punctually at the date when he knew that she
      might be expected there, sufficiently straightened them.
      The intention more than compensated the miscarriage of
      events.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, when her two guests had gone, the inevitable step
      happened: her unchecked impulses grew stronger and more
      definite, and out of the misty subconsciousness of her mind
      the disturbance flared upwards into the light of her
      everyday consciousness. With genuine flame it mounted; it
      was no solitary imagining of her own that had kindled it;
      he, she knew, was a conscious partner, and she had as sign
      the memory that he had kissed her. Somehow, deep in her
      awakening heart, that meant something stupendous to her. It
      had been unrealized at the time, but it had been like the
      touch of some corrosive, sweet and acid, burrowing down,
      eating her and yet feeding her. Up till now, it seemed to
      have signified little, now it invested itself with a
      tremendous significance. Probably to him it meant little;
      men did such things easily, but it was that which had
      burrowed within her, making so insignificant an entry, but
      penetrating so far. It was not a proof that he loved her,
      but it had become a token that she loved him. Otherwise, it
      could not have happened. There was something final in the
      beginning of it all. Then he had kissed her a second time
      on the night of the fancy dress ball. He had called that a
      cousinly kiss, and she smiled at the thought of that, for
      it showed that it required to be accounted for, excused.
      She felt a sort of tenderness for that fluttering,
      broken-winged subterfuge, so transparent, so undeceptive.
      If cousins kissed, they did not recollect their
      relationship afterwards, especially if there was no
      relationship. He had not kissed her because she was some
      sort of cousin to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was hardly stating the case correctly to say that he
      had kissed her. Doubtless, on that first occasion below the
      mulberry-tree it was his head that had bent down to hers,
      while she but remained passive, waiting. But it was she who
      had made him do it, and she gloried in the soft compulsion
      she had put on him. Even as she thought of it this evening,
      her eye sparkled. "He could not help it," she said to
      herself. "He could not help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the sequestered cloistral twilight of her soul there
      had stepped something that had slumbered there all her
      life, something pagan, something incapable of scruples or
      regrets, as void of morals as a nymph or Bacchanal on a
      Greek frieze. It did not trouble, so it seemed, to
      challenge or defy the traditions and principles in which
      she had lived all these years; it appeared to be ignorant
      of their existence, or, at the most, they were but shadows
      that lay in unsubstantial bars across a sunlit pavement. At
      present, it stood there trembling and quiescent, like a
      moth lately broken out from its sheathed chrysalis, but
      momently, now that it had come forth, it would grow
      stronger, and its crumpled wings expand into pinions
      feathered with silver and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she made no plans, she scarcely even turned her eyes
      towards the future, for the future would surely be as
      inevitable as the past had been. One by one the hot August
      days dropped off like the petals of peach blossom, which
      must fall before the fruit begins to swell. She neither
      wanted to delay or hurry their withering. There were but
      few days left, few petals left to fall, for within a week,
      so her husband had written, he would be back, vastly better
      for his cure, and Major Ames was coming with him. "I shall
      be so glad to see my little woman again," he had said.
      "Elsie and I have missed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally she tried to think about her husband, but she
      could not concentrate her mind on him. She was too much
      accustomed to him to be able to fix her thoughts on him
      emotionally. She was equally well accustomed to Elsie, or
      rather equally well accustomed to her complete ignorance
      about Elsie. She could no more have drawn a chart of the
      girl's mind than she could have drawn a picture of the
      branches of the mulberry-tree under which she so often sat,
      beholding the interlacement of its boughs but never really
      seeing them. Never had she known the psychical bond of
      motherhood; even the physical had meant little to her. She
      was Elsie's mother by accident, so to speak; and she was
      but as a tree from which a gardener has made a cutting,
      planting it near, so that sapling and parent stem grow up
      in sight of each other, but quite independently, without
      sense of their original unity. Even when her baby had lain
      at her breast, helpless, and still deriving all from her,
      the sweet intimate mystery of the life that was common to
      them both had been but a whispered riddle to her; and that
      was long ago, its memory had become a faded photograph that
      might really have represented not herself and her baby, but
      any mother and child. It was very possible that before long
      Elsie would be transplanted by marriage, and she herself
      would have to learn a little more about chess in order to
      play with her husband in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, hitherto, had been her emotional life: this summary
      of it and its meagre total is all that can justly be put to
      her credit. She liked her husband, she knew he was kind to
      her, and so, in its inanimate manner, was the food which
      she ate kind to her, in that it nourished and supported
      her. But her gratitude to it was untinged with emotion; she
      was not sentimental over her breakfast, for it was the
      mission of food to give support, and the mission of her
      husband had not been to her much more than that. Neither
      wifehood nor motherhood had awakened her womanhood. Yet, in
      that she was a woman, she was that most dangerous of all
      created or manufactured things, an unexploded shell, liable
      to blow to bits both itself and any who handled her. The
      shell was alive still, its case uncorroded, and its
      contents still potentially violent. That violence at
      present lay dark and quiet within it; its sheath was smooth
      and faintly bright. It seemed but a plaything, a
      parlour-ornament; it could stand on any table in any
      drawing-room. But the heart of it had never been penetrated
      by the love that could transform its violence into
      strength: now its cap was screwed and its fuse fixed. Until
      the damp and decay of age robbed it of its power, it would
      always be liable to wreck itself and its surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      These same days that for her were kindling dangerous stuff,
      passed for Mrs. Ames in a <i>crescendo</i> of awakening
      interest. All her life she had been wrapped round like the
      kernel of a nut, in the hard, dry husk of
      conventionalities, her life had been encased in a
      succession of minute happenings, and, literally speaking,
      she had never breathed the outer air of ideas. As has been
      noticed, she gave regular patronage to St. Barnabas'
      Church, and spent a solid hour or two every week in
      decorating it with the produce of her husband's garden,
      from earliest spring, when the faint, shy snowdrops were
      available, to late autumn, when October and November frosts
      finally blackened the salvias and chrysanthemums. But all
      that had been of the nature of routine: a certain
      admiration for the vicar, a passionless appreciation of his
      nobly ascetic life, his strong, lean face, and the fire of
      his utterances had made her attendance regular, and her
      contributions to his charities quite creditably profuse in
      proportion to her not very ample means. But she had never
      denied herself anything in order to increase them, while
      the time she spent over the flowers was amply compensated
      for when she saw the eclipse they made of Mrs. Brooks'
      embroideries, or when the lilies dropped their
      orange-staining pollen on to the altar-cloth. Stranger,
      perhaps, from the emotional point of view, had been her
      recently attempted rejuvenescence, but even that had been a
      calculated and materialistic effort. It had not been a
      manifestation of her love for her husband, or of a desire
      to awaken his love for her. It was merely a decorative
      effort to attract his attention, and prevent it wandering
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, with her kindled sympathy for the Suffragette
      movement, there was springing up in her the consciousness
      of a kinship with her sex whom, hitherto, she had regarded
      as a set of people to whom, in the matter of dinner-giving
      and entirely correct social behaviour, she must be an
      example and a law, while even her hospitalities had not
      been dictated by the spirit of hospitality but rather by a
      sort of pompous and genteel competition. Now she was
      beginning to see that behind the mere events of life, if
      they were to be worth anything, must lie an idea, and here
      behind this woman's crusade, with all its hooliganism, its
      hysteria, its apish fanaticism, lay an idea of justice and
      sisterhood. They seemed simple words, and she would have
      said off-hand that she knew what they meant. But, as she
      began faintly to understand them, she knew that she had
      been as ignorant of them as of what Australia really was.
      To her, as it was a geographical expression only, so
      justice was an abstract expression. But the meaning of
      justice was known to those who gave up the comforts and
      amenities of life for its sake, and for its sake cheerfully
      suffered ridicule and prison life and misunderstanding. And
      the fumes of an idea, to one who had practically never
      tasted one, intoxicated her as new wine mounts to the head
      of a teetotaler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideas are dangerous things, and should be kept behind a
      fireguard, for fear that the children, of whom this world
      largely consists, should burn their fingers, thinking that
      these bright, sparkling toys are to be played with. Mrs
      Ames, in spite of her unfamiliarity with them, did not fall
      into this error. She realized that if she was to warm
      herself, to get the glow of the fire in her cramped and
      frozen limbs, she must treat it with respect, and learn to
      handle it. That, at any rate, was her intention, and she
      had a certain capacity for thoroughness.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the last week of August that Major Ames was
      expected back, after three weeks of treatment. At first, as
      reflected in his letters, his experiences had been
      horrifying; the waters nauseated him, and the irritating
      miscarriage of the plan which was the real reason for his
      going to Harrogate, caused him fits of feeble rage which
      were the more maddening because they had to be borne
      secretly and silently. Also the lodgings he had procured
      seemed to him needlessly expensive, and all this efflux of
      bullion was being poured out on treatment which Dr. Evans
      had told him was really quite unnecessary. Regular and
      sparkling letters from his wife, in praise of August spent
      at Riseborough, continued to arrive and filled him with
      impotent envy. He, too, might be spending August at
      Riseborough if he had not been quite so precipitate. As it
      was, his mornings were spent in absorbing horrible draughts
      and gently stewing in the fetid waters of the Starbeck
      spring: his meals were plain to the point of grotesqueness,
      his evenings were spent in playing inane games of patience,
      while Elsie and the doctor pored silently over their
      chessboard, saying "Check" to each other at intervals. But
      through the days and their tedious uniformity there ran a
      certain unquietness and desire. It was clear that Millie,
      no less than he, had planned that they should be together
      in August, but his desire did not absorb him, rather it
      made him restless and anxious about the future. He did not
      even know if he was really in love with her; he did not
      even know if he wanted to be. The thought of her kindled
      his imagination, and he could picture himself in love with
      her: at the same time he was not certain whether, if the
      last two months could be lived over again, he would let
      himself drift into the position where he now found himself.
      There was neither ardour nor anything imperative in his
      heart; something, it is true, was heated, but it only
      smouldered and smoked. It was of the nature of such fire as
      bursts out in haystacks: it was born of stuffiness and
      packed confinement, and was as different as two things of
      the same nature can be, from the swift lambency and
      laudable flame of sun-kindled and breeze-fed flame. It
      disquieted and upset him; he could not soberly believe in
      the pictures his imagination drew of his being irresistibly
      in love with her: their colour quickly faded, their
      outlines were wavering and uncertain. And the background
      was even more difficult to fill in . . . how was the
      composition to be arranged? Where would Amy stand? What
      aspect would Riseborough wear? And then, after a long
      silence, Elsie said "Check."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames was due to arrive at Riseborough soon after four
      in the afternoon, and Mrs. Ames was at pains to be at home
      by that hour to welcome him and give him tea, and had
      persuaded Harry to go up to the station to meet him. She
      had gathered a charming decoration of flowers to make the
      room bright, and had put a couple more vases of them in his
      dressing-room. Before long a cab arrived from the station
      bearing his luggage, but neither he nor Harry occupied it.
      So it was natural to conclude that they were walking down,
      and she made tea, since they would not be many minutes
      behind the leisurely four-wheeler. She wanted very
      particularly to give him an auspicious and comfortable
      return: he must not think that, because this Suffragette
      movement occupied her thoughts so much, she was going to
      become remiss in care for him. But still the minutes went
      on, and she took a cup of tea herself, and found it already
      growing astringent. What could have detained him she could
      not guess, but certainly he should have another brew of tea
      made for him, for he hated what in moments of irritation he
      called tincture of tannin. Five o'clock struck, and the two
      quarters that duly followed it. Before that a conjecture
      had formed itself in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the rattle of his deposited hat and stick in the
      hall, and the rattle of the door-handle for his entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Amy," he said, "and here's your returned prodigal.
      Train late as usual, and I walked down. How are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well indeed, Lyndhurst," she said; "and there is no
      need to ask you how you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your luggage arrived nearly an hour ago," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten that detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hour ago? Surely not," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him one more pause in which he could say more, but
      nothing came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have had tea, I suppose," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Evans insisted on my dropping in to his house, and
      taking a cup there. That rogue Harry has stopped on. Well,
      well: we were all young once! You remember the old story I
      told you about the Colonel's wife when I was a lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered it perfectly. She felt sure also that he had
      not meant to tell her where he had been since his arrival
      at the station.
    </p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The day was of early October, and Dr. Evans, who was
      driving his swift, steady cob, harnessed to the light
      dogcart, along the flat road towards Norton, had leisure to
      observe the beauty of the flaming season. He had but a
      couple of visits to make, and neither of the cases caused
      him any professional anxiety. But it was with conscious
      effort that he commanded his obedient mind to cease
      worrying, and drink in the beneficent influence of this
      genial morning that followed on a night that had given them
      the first frost of the year. The road, after leaving
      Riseborough, ran through a couple of level miles of
      delectable woodland; ditches filled and choked with the
      full-grown grass and herbage of the summer bordered it on
      each side. On the left, the sun had turned the frozen
      night-dews into a liquid heraldry, on the right where the
      roadside foliage was still in shadow, the faceted jewels of
      the frost that hinted of the coming winter still stiffened
      the herbage, and was white on the grey beards of the
      sprawling clematis in the hedges. But high above these
      low-growing tangles of vegetation, an ample glory flamed,
      and the great beech forest was all ablaze with orange and
      red flame tremulous in the breeze. Here and there a
      yew-tree, tawny-trunked and green-velveted with undeciduous
      leaf, seemed like a black spot of unconsumed fuel in the
      fire of the autumn; here a company of sturdy oaks seemed
      like a group of square-shouldered young men amid the
      maidens of the woodland. It had its fairies too, the
      sylph-like birches, whose little leaves seemed shed about
      their white shapeliness like a shower of confetti. Then, in
      the more open glades, short and rabbit-cropped turf
      sparkled emerald-like amid the sober greys and browns of
      the withering heather and the russet antlers of the
      bracken. Now and then a rabbit with white scutt*, giving a
      dot-and-dash signal of danger to his family, would scamper
      into shelter at the rattle of the approaching dogcart. Now
      and then a pheasant, whose plumage seemed to reproduce in
      metal the tints of the golden autumn, strode with lowered
      head and tail away from the dangerous vicinity of man.
      Below the beeches the ground was uncarpeted by any
      vegetation, but already the "fallen glories" of the leaf
      were beginning to lie there, and occasionally a squirrel
      ran rustling across them, and having gained the security of
      his lofty ways among the trees, scolded Puck-like at the
      interruption that had made him leave his breakfast of the
      burst beech-nuts. To the right, below the high-swung level
      road, the ground declined sharply, and gave glimpses of the
      distant sun-burnished sea; above, small companies of
      feathery clouds, assembled together as if migrating for the
      winter, fluttered against the summer azure of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      * [Ed. note: An obsolete early Saxon word for a
      rabbit&rsquo;s white bob-tail.]
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Evans' alert and merry eye dwelt on those delectable
      things, and in obedience to his brain, noted and
      appreciated the manifold festivity of the morning, but it
      did so not as ordinarily, by instinct and eager impulses,
      but because he consciously bade it. It needed the spur; its
      alertness and its merriness were pressed on it, and by
      degrees the spur failed to stimulate it, and he fell to
      regarding the well-groomed quarters of his long-stepping
      cob, which usually afforded him so pleasant a contemplation
      of strong and harmonious muscularity. But this morning even
      they failed to delight him, and the rhythm of its firm trot
      made no music in his mind. There came a crease which
      deepened into a decided frown between his eyes, and he
      communed with the trouble in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were various lesser worries, not of sufficient
      importance to disturb seriously the equanimity of a busy
      and well-balanced man, and though each was trivial enough
      in itself, and distinctly had a humorous side to a mind
      otherwise content, the cumulative effect of them was not
      amusing. In the first place, there was the affair of Harry
      Ames, who, in a manner sufficiently ludicrous and calfish,
      had been making love to his wife. As any other sensible man
      would have done, Wilfred Evans had seen almost immediately
      on his return to Riseborough that Harry was disposed to
      make himself ridiculous, and had given a word of kindly
      warning to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snub him a bit, little woman," he had said. "We're having
      a little too much of him. It's fairer on the boy, too.
      You're too kind to him. A woman like you so easily turns a
      boy's head. And you've often said he is rather a dreadful
      sort of youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      But for some reason she took the words in ill part,
      becoming rather precise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you mean," she said. "Will you explain,
      please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy enough, my dear. He's here too much; he's dangling
      after you. Laugh at him a little, or yawn a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that he's in love with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's too big a word, little woman, though I'm sure
      you see what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I do. I think your suggestion is rather coarse,
      Wilfred, and quite ill-founded. Is every one who is polite
      and attentive supposed to be in love with me? I only ask
      for information."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think your own good sense will supply you with all
      necessary information," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her good sense apparently had done nothing of the kind,
      and eventually Dr. Evans had spoken to Harry's father on
      the subject. The visits had ceased with amazing abruptness
      after that, and Dr. Evans had found himself treated to a
      stare of blank unrecognition when he passed Harry in the
      street, and a curl of the lip which he felt must have been
      practised in private. But the Omar Khayyam Club would be
      the gainers, for they owed to it those stricken and
      embittered stanzas called "Parted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here comedy verged on farce, but the farce did not amuse
      him. He knew that his own interpretation of Harry's
      assiduous presence was correct, so why should his wife have
      so precisely denied that those absurd attentions meant
      nothing? There was nothing to resent in the sensible
      warning that a man was greatly attracted by her. Nor was
      there warrant for Colonel Ames' horror and dismay at the
      suggestion, when the doctor spoke to him about it.
      "Infamous young libertine" was surely a hyperbolical
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Evans unconsciously flicked the cob rather sharply with
      his whip-lash, to that excellent animal's surprise, for he
      was covering his miles in five minutes apiece, and the
      doctor conveyed his apologies for his unintentional hint
      with a soothing remark. Then his thoughts drifted back
      again. That was not all the trouble with the Ames' family,
      for his wife had had a quarrel with Mrs. Ames. This kindly
      man hated to quarrel with anybody, and, for his part,
      successfully refused to do so, and that his wife should
      find herself in such a predicament was equally distressing
      to him. No doubt it was all a storm in a tea-cup, but if
      you happen to be living in the tea-cup too, a storm there
      is just as upsetting as a gale on the high seas. It is
      worse, indeed, for on the high seas a ship can run into
      fairer weather, but there is no escape from these tea-cup
      disturbances. The entire tea-cup was involved: all
      Riseborough, which a year ago had seemed to him so suitable
      a place in which to pursue an unexacting practice, to
      conduct mild original work, in the peace and quiet of a
      small society and domestic comfort, was become a tempest of
      conflicting winds. "And all arising from such a pack of
      nonsense," as the doctor thought impatiently to himself,
      only just checking the whip-lash from falling again on the
      industrious cob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of Mrs. Ames in the Suffragette movement had
      given rise to all this. She had announced a drawing-room
      meeting to be held in her house, now a fortnight ago, and
      the drawing-room meeting had exploded in mid-career, like a
      squib, scattering sparks and combustible material over all
      Riseborough. It appeared that Mrs. Ames, finding that the
      comprehension of Suffragette aims extended to the
      middle-class circles in Riseborough, had asked the wives
      and daughters of tradesmen to take part in it. It wanted
      but little after that to make Mrs. Altham remark quite
      audibly that she had not known that she was to have the
      privilege of meeting so many ladies with whom she was not
      previously acquainted, and the sarcastic intention of her
      words was not lost upon her new friends. Tea seemed but to
      increase the initial inflammation, and the interest Mrs.
      Ames had intended to awake on the subject of votes for
      women was changed into an interest in ascertaining who
      could be most offensively polite, a very pretty game. It is
      not to be wondered at that, before twenty-four hours had
      passed, Mrs. Altham had started an anti-Suffragette league,
      and Millie, still strong in the conviction that under no
      circumstances could she go to prison, had allowed herself
      to be drawn into it. Next night at dinner she softly made a
      terrible announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I passed Cousin Amy in the street just now," she said;
      "she did not seem to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she didn't see you, little woman," said her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I did not seem to see her," added Millie, who had not
      finished her sentence. "But if she cares to come to see me
      and explain, I shall behave quite as usual to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, little woman!" said Dr. Evans in a
      conciliating spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I do not see what is the good of saying 'Come, come,'"
      she said, with considerable precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was sufficient to cause very sensible disquiet to
      a man who attached so proper an importance to peaceful and
      harmonious conditions of life, yet it was but a small thing
      compared to a far deeper anxiety that brooded over him.
      Till now he had not let himself directly contemplate it,
      but to-day, as he returned from his two visits, he made
      himself face this last secret trouble. He felt it was
      necessary for him to ascertain, for the sake of others no
      less than himself, what part, if any, of his disquiet was
      grounded on certainty, what part, if any, might be the
      figment of an over-anxious imagination. But he knew he was
      not anxious by temperament, nor given to imagine troubles.
      If anything, he was more prone, in his desire for a
      pleasant and studious life, to shut his eyes to the
      apparent approach of storm, trusting that it would blow by.
      He was anxious about Millie, not without cause; a hundred
      symptoms justified his anxiety. She who for so long had
      been of such imperturbable serenity of temper that a man
      who did not feel her charm might have called her jelly-fish
      was the prey of fifty moods a day. She had strange little
      fits of tenderness to him, with squalls of peevishness
      quite as strange. She was restless and filled with an
      energy that flamed and flickered and vanished, leaving her
      indolent and inert. She would settle herself for a morning
      of letter writing, and after tearing up a couple of notes,
      put on her gardening gloves and get as far as the
      herbaceous bed. Then she would find an imperative reason
      for going into the town, and so sit down at her piano to
      practise. Her appetite, usually of the steady reliable
      order, failed her, and she passed broken and tossing
      nights. Had she been a girl, he would have said those
      symptoms all pointed one way; and it would probably not
      have been difficult to guess who was the young man in
      question. Yet he could scarcely face the conclusion applied
      to his wife. It was a hideous thing that a husband should
      harbour such a suspicion, more hideous that the husband
      should be himself. And perhaps more hideous of all, that he
      should guess--again without difficulty--who was the man in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no conception what to do, or whether to do nothing;
      it seemed that action and inaction might alike end in
      disaster. And, again, the whole of his explanation of
      Millie's symptoms might be erroneous. There might be other
      explanations--indeed, there were others possible. As to
      that, time would show; at present the best course, perhaps
      the only right course, was to be watchful, yet not
      suspicious, observant, not prying. Rather than pry or be
      suspicious he would go to Millie herself, and without
      reservation tell her all that had been in his mind. He was
      well aware what the heroic attitude, the attitude of the
      virile, impetuous Englishman, dear to melodrama, would have
      been. It was quite easy for him to "tax" Major Ames with
      baseness, to grind his teeth at his wife, and then burst
      into manly tears, each sob of which seemed to rend him. But
      to his quiet, sensible nature, it seemed difficult to see
      what was supposed to happen next. In melodrama the curtain
      went down, and you started ten years later in Queensland
      with regenerated natures distributed broadcast. But in
      actual life it was impossible to start again ten years
      later, or ten minutes later. You had to go on all the time.
      Willingly would he, on this divine October morning, have
      started again, indefinitely later. The difficulty was how
      to go on now.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      His cases had not long detained him, and it was still not
      long after noon when the cob, still pleased and alert with
      motion, but with smoking flanks, drew up at his door. The
      clear chill of the morning had altogether passed, and the
      air in the basin or tea-cup of a town was still and sultry.
      There was a familiar hat on the table in the hall, a bunch
      of long-stemmed tawny chrysanthemums lay by it. And at that
      sight some distant echo of barbaric and simple man,
      deplorable to the smoothness of civilization and altogether
      obsolete, was resonant in him. He pitched the
      chrysanthemums into the street, where they flew like a
      shooting star close by the head of General Fortescue, who
      was tottering down to the club, and slammed the door. It
      was melodramatic and foolish enough, but the desire that
      prompted it was quite sincere and irresistible, and if at
      the moment Major Ames had been in that cool oak-panelled
      hall, there is little doubt that Dr. Evans would have done
      his best to pitch him out after his flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave himself a moment to recover from his
      superficial violence, and then went out into the garden.
      They were sitting together on the bench under the
      mulberry-tree, and Major Ames got up with his usual
      briskness as he approached. Somehow Dr. Evans felt as if he
      was being welcomed and made to feel at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning," said Major Ames. "Glorious day, isn't it? I
      just stepped over with a handful of flowers, and we've been
      having a bit of a chat, a bit of a chat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin Lyndhurst has very kindly come to talk over all
      these little disturbances," said Millie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I explain?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Evans took the seat that Major Ames had vacated,
      leaving him free to sit down in a garden chair opposite, or
      to stand, just as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is like this, Wilfred," she said. "Cousin Amy did not
      like my joining the anti-Suffragette league which Mrs.
      Altham started, and I have told Lyndhurst that I did not
      care a straw one way or the other, except that I could not
      go to prison to please Cousin Amy or any one else. But it
      looked like taking sides, she thought. So Lyndhurst thought
      it would make everything easy if I didn't join any league
      at all. I think it very clever and tactful of him to think
      of that, and I will certainly tell Mrs. Altham I find I am
      too busy. Of course, there is no quarrel between Cousin Amy
      and me, and Lyndhurst wants to assure us that he isn't
      mixed up in it, though there isn't any--and, of course, if
      Cousin Amy didn't see me the other day when I thought she
      pretended not to, it makes a difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie delivered herself of these lucid statements with her
      usual deferential air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is very kind of Cousin Lyndhurst to take so
      much trouble," she added. "He is stopping to lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames made a noble little gesture that disclaimed any
      credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's nothing, a mere nothing," he said, quite truly. "But
      I'm sure you hate little domestic jars as much as I do. As
      Amy once said, my profession was to be a man of war, but my
      instinct was to be a man of peace. Ha! Ha! I'm only
      delighted my little olive branch has--has met with
      success," he added rather feebly, being unable to think of
      any botanical metaphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor got up. It is to be feared that, in his present
      state of mind, he felt not the smallest admiration or
      gratitude for the work of Lyndhurst the Peacemaker, but
      only saw in it a purely personal desire to secure an
      uninterrupted <i>va et vient</i> between the two houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I haven't the slightest intention of quarrelling
      with anybody," he said. "It seems to me the most deplorable
      waste of time and energy, besides being very uncomfortable.
      Let us go in to lunch, Millie; I have to go out again at
      two o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Millie wrote an amiable and insincere little note to Mrs.
      Altham, which Major Ames undertook to deliver on his way
      home, explaining how, since Elsie had gone to Dresden to
      perfect herself in the German language, she herself had
      become so busy that she did not know which way to turn,
      besides missing Elsie very much. She felt, therefore, that
      since she would not be able to give as much time as she
      wished to this very interesting anti-Suffragette movement,
      it would be better not to give to it any time at all. This
      she wrote directly after her husband had gone out again,
      and brought to Major Ames, who was waiting for it. He, too,
      had said he would have to be off at once. She gave him the
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is," she said; "and so many thanks for leaving
      it. But you are not hurrying away at once, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not keeping you in?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled down the lace blinds over the window that looked
      into the street; the October sun, it is true, beat rather
      hotly into the room, but the instinct that dictated her
      action was rather a desire for privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if I would not sooner sit and talk to you," she said,
      "than go out. I have no one to go out with. I am rather
      lonely since Elsie has gone, and I daresay I shall not see
      Wilfred again till dinner-time. It is rather amusing that I
      have just written to Mrs. Altham to say how busy I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      He came and sat a little closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," he said, "I am in the same boat as you. I
      haven't set eyes on Amy all morning, and this afternoon I
      know she has a couple of meetings. It's extraordinary how
      this idea of votes for women has taken hold of her. Not a
      bad thing, though, as long as she doesn't go making a fool
      of herself in public, and as long as she doesn't have any
      more quarrels with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you have done if she had really wished to
      quarrel with me over Mrs. Altham's league?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what I told her. I said I would be no partner to it,
      and as long as you would receive me here <i>en garon</i> I
      should always come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was dear of you," she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I think we made a mistake in coming to settle
      here," she said; "but you know how obstinate Wilfred is,
      and how little influence I have with him. But then, again,
      I think of our friendship. I have not had many friends. I
      think, perhaps, I am too shy and timid with people. When I
      like them very much I find it difficult to express myself.
      It is rather sad not to be able to show what you feel quite
      frankly. It prevents your being understood by the people
      whom you most want to understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But beneath this profession of incompetence, it seemed to
      Major Ames that there lurked a very efficient strength. He
      felt himself being gradually overpowered by a superior
      force, a force that did not strike and disable and
      overbear, but cramped and paralysed the power of its
      adversary, enfolding him, clinging to him. There was still
      something in him, some part of his will which was hostile
      and opposed to her: it was just that which she assailed.
      And in alliance with that paralysing force was her
      attraction and charm--soft, yielding, feminine; the two
      advanced side by side, terrible twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer for a moment, and it flashed across his
      mind that this cool room, shaded from the street glare by
      the lace curtains, and suffused with the greenish glow of
      the sunlight reflected from the lawn outside, was like a
      trap. . . . She gave a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See how badly I express myself," she said. "You are
      puzzling, frowning. Don't frown, you look best when you are
      laughing. I get so tired of frowning faces. Wilfred so
      often frowns all dinner-time when he is thinking over
      something connected with microbes. And he frowns over his
      chess, when he cannot make up his mind whether to exchange
      bishops. We play chess every evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively she had drawn back a little, when she saw he
      did not advance to meet her, and spoke as if chess and the
      pathos of her dumbness to express friendship were things of
      equal moment. There was no calculation about it: it was the
      expression of one type, the eternal feminine attracted and
      wishing to attract. Her descent to these commonplaces
      restored his confidence; the room was a trap no longer, but
      the pleasant drawing-room he knew so well, with its
      charming mistress seated by him. It was almost inevitable
      that he should contrast the hot plushes and saddle-bag
      cushions of his own, its angular chairs and Axminster
      carpets with the cool chintzes here, the lace-shrouded
      windows, the Persian rugs. More marked was the contrast
      between the mistresses of the two houses. Amy had been
      writing at her davenport a good deal lately, and her short,
      stiff back had been the current picture of her. Here was a
      woman, dim in the half light, wanting to talk to him, to
      make timid confidences, to make him realize how much his
      friendship meant to her. His confidence returned with
      disarming completeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm sure I should find it dismal enough at home," he
      said, "if I hadn't somewhere to go to, knowing I should
      find a welcome. Mind you, I don't blame Amy. For years now,
      when we've been alone in the evening, she has done her
      work, and I have read the paper, and I daresay we haven't
      said a dozen words till Parker brought in the bedroom
      candles, or sometimes we play picquet--for love. But now
      evenings spent like that seem to me very prosy and dismal.
      Perhaps it's Harrogate that has made me a bit more supple
      and youthful, though I'm sure it's ridiculous enough that a
      tough old campaigner like me should feel such things--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans put forward her chin, raising her face towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why ridiculous?" she asked. "You must be so much
      younger than dear Cousin Amy. I wonder--I wonder if she
      feels that too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was there a very devilish suggestion, the more so
      because, in proportion to the suggestion, so very little
      was stated. It succeeded admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear Amy!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said that once before, when Cleopatra-Amy was
      contrasted with Cleopatra-Millie. But there was a
      significance in the repetition of it. Once the assumed
      identity of character had suggested the comment, now there
      was no assumed character. It concerned Millie and Amy
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evans put back her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure Cousin Amy ought to be very happy," she said
      softly. "You are so devoted to her, and all. I almost think
      you spoil her, Lyndhurst. It is all so romantic. Fancy
      being a woman, and as old as Cousin Amy, and yet having a
      young man so devoted. Harry, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a billow of confidence tinged with self-appreciation
      surged over Major Ames. After all, his wife was much older
      than him, for he was still a young man, and his youth was
      being expanded on sweet-peas and the garden roller. And he
      was stirred into a high flight of philosophical conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, what a puzzle life is!" he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to this high-water mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it might be so simple," she said. "It should be so
      easy to be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Major Ames knew where he was. In one sense he was
      worthy of the occasion, in another he did not feel up to
      all that it implied. He rose hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better go," he said rather hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had smoked five cigarettes since lunch. The
      hoarseness might easily have been the result of this
      indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not attempt to keep him, nor did she make it
      incumbent on him to give her a kiss, however cousinly. She
      did not even rise, but only looked up at him from her low
      chair as she gave him her hand, smiling a little secretly,
      as Mona Lisa smiles. But she felt quite satisfied with
      their talk; he would think over it, and find fresh signals
      and private beckonings in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and see me again," she said. There was a touch of
      imperativeness in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked through the lace curtain and saw him go out into
      the street. There was something in the gutter of the
      roadway which he inquired into with the end of his stick.
      It looked like a withered bunch of dusty chrysanthemums.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames, meantime, had lunched at home, and gone off
      immediately afterwards, as her husband had conjectured, to
      a meeting. In the last month the membership of her league
      had largely increased, and it was no longer possible to
      convene its meetings in her own drawing-room, for it
      numbered some fifty persons, including a dozen men of
      enlightened principles. Even at first, as has been seen,
      she had welcomed (thereby incurring Mrs. Altham's
      disapproval) several ladies with whom she did not usually
      associate, and now the gathering was entirely independent
      of all class distinctions. The wife of the station-master,
      for instance, was one of the most active members and walked
      up and down the platform with a large rosette of
      Suffragette colours selling current copies of the
      <i>Clarion.</i> And no less remarkable than this growth of
      the league was the growth of Mrs. Ames. She was neither
      pompous nor condescending to those persons whom, a couple
      of months ago, she would have looked upon as being barely
      existent, except if they were all in church, when she would
      very probably have shared a hymn-book with any of them, the
      "Idea" for which they had assembled galvanizing them,
      though strictly temporarily, into the class of existent
      people. Now, the idea which brought them together in the
      commodious warehouse, kindly lent and sufficiently
      furnished by Mr. Turner, had given them a permanent
      existence, and they were not automatically blotted out of
      her book of life the moment these meetings were over, as
      they would have been so short a time ago in church, when
      the last "Amen" was said. The bonds of her barren and
      barbaric conventionality were bursting; indeed, it was not
      so much that others, not even those of "her class," were
      becoming women to her, as that she was becoming a woman
      herself. She had scarcely been one hitherto; she had been a
      piece of perfect propriety. And how far she had travelled
      from her original conception of the Suffragette movement as
      suitable to supply a novelty for the autumn that would
      eclipse the memory of the Shakespearean ball, may be
      gathered from the fact that she no longer took the chair at
      these meetings, but was an ordinary member. Mr. Turner had
      far more experience in the duties of a chairman: she had
      herself proposed him and would have seconded him as well,
      had such a step been in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day the meeting was assembled to discuss the part which
      the league should take in the forthcoming elections. The
      Tory Government was at present in power, and likely to
      remain in office, while Riseborough itself was a fairly
      safe seat for the Tory member, who was Sir James
      Westbourne. Before polemical or obstructive measures could
      be decided on, it had clearly been necessary to ascertain
      Sir James' views on the subject of votes for women, and
      to-day his answer had been received and was read to the
      meeting. It was as unsatisfactory as it was brief, and
      their "obedient servant" had no sympathy with, and so
      declined to promise any support to, their cause. Mr. Turner
      read this out, and laid it down on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will ladies or gentlemen give us their views on the course
      we are to adopt?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen simultaneously rose, and simultaneously sat down
      again. The chairman asked Mrs. Brooks to address the
      meeting. Another and another succeeded her, and there was
      complete unanimity of purpose in their suggestions. Sir
      James' meetings and his speeches to his constituents must
      not be allowed to proceed without interruption. If he had
      no sympathy with the cause, the cause would show a marked
      lack of sympathy with him. Thereafter the league resolved
      itself into a committee of ways and means. The President of
      the Board of Trade was coming to support Sir James'
      candidature at a meeting the date of which was already
      fixed for a fortnight hence, and it was decided to make a
      demonstration in force. And as the discussion went on, and
      real practical plans were made, that strange fascination
      and excitement at the thought of shouting and interrupting
      at a public meeting, of becoming for the first time of some
      consequence, began to seethe and ferment. Most of the
      members were women, whose lives had been passed in
      continuous self-repression, who had been frozen over by the
      narcotic ice of a completely conventional and humdrum
      existence. Many of them were unmarried and already of
      middle-age; their natural human instincts had never known
      the blossoming and honey which the fulfilment of their
      natures would have brought. To the eagerness and sincerity
      with which they welcomed a work that demanded justice for
      their sex, there was added this excitement of doing
      something at last. There was an opportunity of expansion,
      of stepping out, under the stimulus of an idea, into an
      experience that was real. In kind, this was akin to
      martyrs, who rejoiced and sang when the prospects of
      persecution came near; as martyrs for the sake of their
      faith thought almost with glee of the rack and the burning,
      so, minutely, the very prospect of discomfort and rough
      handling seemed attractive, if, by such means, the cause
      was infinitesimally advanced. To this, a sincere and wholly
      laudable desire, was added the more personal stimulus. They
      would be doing something, instead of suffering the tedium
      of passivity, acting instead of being acted on. For it is
      only through centuries of custom that the woman, physically
      weak and liable to be knocked down, has become the servant
      of the other sex. She is fiercer at heart, more courageous,
      more scornful of consequences than he; it is only muscular
      inferiority of strength that has subdued her into the place
      that she occupies, that, and the periods when, for the
      continuance of the race, she must submit to months of
      tender and strong inaction. There she finds fruition of her
      nature, and there awakes in her a sweet indulgence for the
      strange, childish lust of being master, of parading, in
      making of laws and conventions, his adventitious power, of
      the semblance of sovereignty that has been claimed by man.
      At heart she knows that he has but put a tinsel crown on
      his head, and robed himself in spangles that but parody
      real gold. She lays a woman's hand on his child-head, and
      to please him says, "How wise you are, how strong, how
      clever." And the child is pleased, and loves her for it.
      And there is her weakness, for the most dominant thing in
      her nature is the need of being loved. From the beginning
      it must have been so. When Adam's rib was taken from him in
      sleep, he lost more than was left him, and woke to find all
      his finer self gone from him. He was left a blundering
      bumble-bee: to the rib that was taken from him clung the
      courage of the lioness, the wisdom of the serpent, the
      gentleness of the dove, the cunning of the spider, and the
      mysterious charm of the firefly that dances in the dusk.
      But to that rib also clung the desire to be loved.
      Otherwise, in the human race, the male would be slain
      yearly like the drone of the hive. But the strange thing
      that grew from the rib, like flowers from buried carrion,
      desired love. There was its strength and its weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It desired love, and in its desire it suffered all
      degradation to obtain it. And no leanness of soul entered
      into the gratification of its desire. Only when its desire
      was pinched and rationed, or when, by the operation of
      civilized law, all fruit of desire was denied it, so that
      the blossom of sex was made into one unfruitful bud, did
      revolt come. Long generations produced the germ, long
      generations made it active. At length it swam up to sight,
      from subaqueous dimnesses, feeble and violent, conscious of
      the justice of its cause and demanding justice. But what
      helped to make the desire for justice so attractive was the
      violence, the escape from self-repression that the demand
      gave opportunity for, to many who, all their lives, had
      been corked or wired down in comfort, which no woman cares
      about, or sealed up in spinster-hood and decorous emptiness
      of days. There was justice in the demand, and hysterical
      excitement in demanding.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To others, and in this little league of Riseborough there
      were many such, the prospect of making those demands was
      primarily appalling, and to none more than to poor Mrs.
      Ames, when the plan of campaign was discussed, decided on,
      and entrusted to the members of the league. It required
      almost more courage than the idea was capable of inspiring
      to face, even in anticipation, the thought of shouting
      "Votes for Women" when good-humoured Cousin James rose and
      said "Ladies and gentlemen!" Very possibly, as had often
      happened in Cousin James' previous candidatures, Lyndhurst
      would wish his wife to ask him and the President of the
      Board of Trade to dinner before the meeting, an occasion
      which would warrant the materialization of the most
      sumptuous of all the dinners tabulated on the printed
      menu-cards, while sherry would be given with soup, hock
      with fish, and a constant flow of champagne be kept up
      afterwards, until port time. In that case Cousin James
      would certainly ask them to sit on the platform, and they
      would roll richly to the town hall in his motor, all
      blazing with Conservative colours, while she, in a small
      bag, would be surreptitiously conveying there her great
      Suffragette rosette, and a small steel chain with a
      padlock. She would be sitting probably next the Mayor, who
      would introduce the speakers, and no doubt refer to "the
      presence of the fair sex" who graced the platform. During
      this she would have to pin her colours on her dress, chain
      herself up like Andromeda, snap the patent spring-lock of
      the padlock, and when Sir James rose . . . her imagination
      could not grapple with the picture: it turned sickly away,
      refusing to contemplate. And this to a cousin and a guest,
      who had just eaten the best salt, so to speak, of her
      table, from one who all her life had been so perfect a
      piece of propriety! She felt far too old a bottle for such
      new wine. Sitting surrounded by fellow-crusaders, and
      infected by the proximity of their undiluted enthusiasm, it
      would be difficult enough, but that she should chain
      herself, perhaps, to the very leg of the table which Cousin
      James would soon thump in the fervour of his oratory, as he
      announced all those Tory platitudes in which she so firmly
      believed, and which she must so shrilly interrupt, while
      sitting solitary in the desert of his sleek and staid
      supporters, was not only an impossible but an unthinkable
      achievement. Whatever horrors fate, that gruesome weaver of
      nightmares, might have in store for her, she felt that here
      was something that transcended imagination. She could not
      sit on the platform with Lyndhurst and Cousin James and the
      Mayor and Lady Westbourne, and do what was required of her,
      for the sake of any crusade. Curfew, so to speak, would
      have to ring that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Lyndhurst were dining alone the evening after this
      meeting of "ways and means," he in that state of mind which
      she not inaptly described as "worried" when she felt kind,
      and "cross" when she felt otherwise. He had come home hot
      from his walk, and, having sat in his room where there was
      no fire, when evening fell chilly, had had a smart touch of
      lumbago. Thus there were clearly two causes for complaint
      against Amy, and a third disturbing topic, for there was no
      shadow of doubt that it was his bouquet of chrysanthemums
      that he had found in the road outside Dr. Evans' house, and
      even before the lumbago had produced its characteristic
      pessimism, he had been unable to find any encouraging
      explanation of this floral castaway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I don't know what was the good of my spending all
      August," he said, "in that filthy hole of a Harrogate, at
      no end of expense, too, if I'm to be crippled all winter.
      But you urged me to so strongly: should never have thought
      of going there otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you have only been crippled for half-an-hour at
      present," she observed. "It is a great bore, but if only
      you will take a good hot bath to-night, and have a very
      light dinner, I expect you will be much better in the
      morning. Parker, tell them to see that there is plenty of
      hot water in the kitchen boiler."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll be the only warm thing in the house, if there is,"
      said he. "My room was like an ice-house when I came in.
      Positively like an ice-house. Enough to give a man
      pneumonia, let alone lumbago. Soup cold, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you should take more care of yourself," said Mrs.
      Ames placidly. "Why did you not light the fire instead of
      being cold? I'm sure it was laid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have it just burning up at dinner-time," said he,
      "when I no longer wanted it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still early in the course of dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Light the fire in the drawing-room, Parker," said Mrs.
      Ames. "Let there be a good fire when we come out of
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get roasted alive," said Major Ames, half to himself, but
      intending to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Ames' mind had been feasting for weeks past on
      things which had a solider existence than her husband's
      unreasonable strictures. Since this new diet had been hers,
      his snaps and growls had produced no effect: they often
      annoyed her into repartee, and as likely as not, a few
      months ago, she would have said that his claret seemed a
      very poor kind of beverage. But to-night she felt not the
      smallest desire to retort. She was very sorry for his
      lumbago, but felt no inclination to carry the war into his
      territories, or to tell him that if people, perspiring
      freely, and of gouty habit, choose to sit down without
      changing, and get chilly, they must expect reprisal for
      their imprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we will open the window, dear," she said, "if we find
      we are frizzling. But I don't think it will be too hot.
      Evenings are chilly in October. Did you have a pleasant
      lunch, Lyndhurst? Indeed, I don't know where you lunched. I
      ordered curry for you. I sat down at a quarter to two as
      you did not come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all so infinitesimal . . . yet it was the mental
      diet which had supported her for years. Perhaps after
      dinner they would play picquet. The garden, the kitchen,
      for years, except for gossip infinitely less real, these
      had been the topics. There had been no joy for him in the
      beauty of the garden, only a pleased sense of
      proprietorship, if a rare plant flowered, or if there were
      more roses than usual. For her, she had been vaguely
      pleased if Lyndhurst had taken two helpings of a dish, and
      both of them had been vaguely disquieted if Harry quoted
      Swinburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lunched with the Evans'," he said. "By the way, I met
      your cousin James Westbourne this afternoon, when I was on
      my walk. Extraordinarily cordial he gets when there's
      business ahead that brings him into Riseborough, and he
      wants to cadge a dinner or two. It's little notice he takes
      of us the rest of the year, and I'm sure it's a couple of
      years since he so much as sent you a brace of pheasants,
      and more than that since he asked me to shoot there. But as
      I say, when he wants to pick up a dinner or two in
      Riseborough, he's all heartiness, and saying he doesn't see
      half enough of us. He doesn't seem to strain himself in
      trying to see more, and there's seldom a week-end when he
      and that great guy of a wife of his don't have the house
      packed with people. I suppose we're not smart enough for
      them, except when it's convenient to dine in Riseborough.
      Then he's not above drinking a bottle of my champagne."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was eager in support of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure there's no call for you to open any more bottles
      for him, my dear," she said. "If Cousin James wants to see
      us, he can take his turn in asking us. And Harriet is a
      great guy, as you say, with her big fiddle-head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames shrugged his shoulders rather magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I don't grudge him his dinner," he said, "and, in
      point of fact, I told him he could come and dine with us
      before his first meeting. He's got some Cabinet Minister
      with him, and I said he could bring him too. You might get
      up a little party, that's to say if I'm not in bed with
      this infernal lumbago. And Cousin James will return our
      hospitality by giving us seats on the platform to hear him
      stamp and stammer and rant. An infernal bad speaker. Never
      heard a worse. Wretched delivery, nothing to say, and says
      it all fifty times over. Enough to make a man turn Radical.
      However, he'll have made himself at home with my Mumm, and
      perhaps he'll go to sleep himself before he sends us off."
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, represented the lumbago-view. Major Ames
      had been fulsomely cordial to Cousin James, and had himself
      urged the dinner that he represented now as being forced on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you actually asked him, Lyndhurst?" said Mrs. Ames
      rather faintly. "Did he say he would come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever know your Cousin James refuse a decent
      dinner?" asked Lyndhurst. "And he was kind enough to say he
      would like it at a quarter past seven. Cool, upon my word!
      I wish I had asked him if he'd have thick soup or clear,
      and if he preferred a wing to a leg. That's the sort of
      thing one never thinks of till afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was not attending closely: there was that below
      the surface which claimed all her mind. Consequently she
      missed the pungency of this irony, hearing only the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin James never takes soup at all," she said. "He told
      me it always disagreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames sighed; his lumbago felt less acute, his
      ill-temper had found relief in words, and he had long ago
      discovered that women had no sense of humour. On the whole,
      it was gratifying to find the truth of this so amply
      endorsed. For the moment it put him into quite a good
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I've been grumbling all dinner," he said.
      "Shall we go into the other room? There's little sense in
      my looking at the decanters, if I mayn't take my glass of
      port. Eh! That was a twinge!"
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no use, Henry," said Mrs. Altham on that same
      evening, "telling me it is all stuff and nonsense, when
      I've seen with my own eyes the parcel of Suffragette riband
      being actually directed to Mrs. Brooks; for pen and ink is
      pen and ink, when all is said and done. Tapworth measured
      off six yards of it on the counter-measure that gives two
      feet, for he gave nine lengths of it and put it in paper
      and directed it. Of course, if nine lengths of two feet
      doesn't make eighteen feet, which is six yards, I am wrong
      and you are right, and twice two no longer makes four. And
      there were two other parcels already done up of exactly the
      same shape. You will see if I am not right. Or do you
      suppose that Mrs. Brooks is ordering it just to trim her
      nightgown with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said anything about Mrs. Brooks' nightgown," said
      Henry, who, to do him justice, had been goaded into
      slightly Rabelaisian mood: "I never thought about Mrs.
      Brooks' nightgown. I didn't know she wore one--I mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham made what children would call "a face." Her
      eyes grew suddenly fixed and boiled, and her mouth assumed
      an acidulated expression as if with a plethora of
      lemon-juice. The "face" was due to the entry of the
      parlour-maid with the pudding. It was jelly, and was served
      in silence. Mrs. Altham waited till the door was quietly
      closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a question of Mrs. Brooks' nightgown," she said,
      "since we both agree that she would not order six yards of
      Suffragette riband to trim it. I spoke sarcastically,
      Henry, and you interpreted me literally, as you often do.
      It was the same at Littlestone in August, when the bacon
      was so salt one day that I said to Mrs. Churchill that a
      little bacon in the bath would be equivalent to
      sea-bathing. Upon which you must needs tell her next
      morning to send your bacon to the bath-room, which she did,
      and there was a plate of bacon on the sponge-tray, so
      extraordinary. But all that is beside the point, though
      what she can have thought of you I can't imagine. After
      all, your gift of being literal may help you now. Why does
      Mrs. Brooks want six yards of Suffragette riband, and why
      are there two similar parcels on Tapworth's counter? If I
      had had a moment alone I would certainly have looked at the
      other addresses, and seen where they were being sent. But
      young Tapworth was there all the time--that one with the
      pince-nez, and the ridiculous chin--and he put them into
      the errand-boy's basket, and told him to be sharp about it.
      So I had no chance of seeing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might have strolled along behind the boy to see where
      he went," suggested Mr. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He went on a bicycle," said Mrs. Altham, "and it is
      impossible to stroll behind a boy on a bicycle and hope to
      get there in time. But he went up the High Street. I should
      not in the least wonder if Mrs. Evans had turned
      Suffragette, after that note to me about her not having
      time to attend the anti-Suffragette meetings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Especially since there was only one," said Henry, in the
      literal mood that had been forced on him, "and nobody came
      to that. It would not have sacrificed very much of her
      time. Not that I ever heard it was valuable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What she can do with her day I can't imagine," said Mrs.
      Altham, her mind completely diverted by this new topic.
      "Her cook told Griffiths that as often as not she doesn't
      go down to the kitchen at all in the morning, and she's
      hardly ever to be seen shopping in the High Street before
      lunch, and what with Elsie gone to Dresden, and her husband
      away on his rounds all day, she must be glad when it's
      bedtime. And she's a small sleeper, too, for she told me
      herself that she considers six hours a good night, though I
      expect she sleeps more than she knows, and I daresay has a
      nap after lunch as well. Dear me, what were we talking
      about? Ah, yes, I was saying I should not wonder if she had
      turned Suffragette, though I can't recall what made me
      think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because Tapworth's boy went up the High Street on a
      bicycle," said Mr. Altham, who had a great gift of picking
      out single threads from the tangle of his wife's
      conversation; "though, after all, the High Street leads to
      other houses besides Mrs. Evans'. The station, for
      instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to want to find fault with everything I say,
      to-night, Henry. I don't know what makes you so contrary.
      But there it is: I saw eighteen yards of Suffragette riband
      being sent out when I happened to be in Tapworth's this
      morning, and I daresay that's but a tithe of what has been
      ordered, though I can't say as to that, unless you expect
      me to stand in the High Street all day and watch. And as to
      what it all means, I'll let you conjecture for yourself,
      since if I told you what I thought, you would probably
      contradict me again."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no wonder that Mrs. Altham was annoyed. She had been
      thrilled to the marrow by the parcels of Suffragette
      riband, and when she communicated her discovery, Henry, who
      usually was so sympathetic, had seen nothing to be thrilled
      about. But he had not meant to be unsympathetic, and
      repaired his error.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure, my dear, that you will have formed a very good
      guess as to what it means," he said. "Tell me what you
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you care to know," said she, "I think it all
      points to there being some demonstration planned, and I for
      one should not be surprised if I looked out of the window
      some morning, and saw Mrs. Ames and Mrs. Brooks and the
      rest of them marching down the High Street with ribands and
      banners. They've been keeping very quiet about it all, at
      least not a word of what they've been doing has come to my
      ears, and I consider that's a proof that something is going
      on and that they want to keep it secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham's legal mind cried out to him to put in the plea
      that a complete absence of news does not necessarily
      constitute a proof that exciting events are occurring, but
      he rightly considered that such logic might be taken to be
      a sign of continued "contrariness." So he gave an illogical
      assent to his wife's theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly it is odd that nothing more has been heard of it
      all," he said. "I wonder what they are planning. The
      election coming on so soon, too! Can they be planning
      anything in connection with that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham got up, letting her napkin fall on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henry, I believe you have hit it," she said. "Now what can
      it be? Let us go into the drawing-room, and thresh it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the best threshing-machines in the world cannot
      successfully fulfil their function unless there is some
      material to work upon; they can but show by their whirling
      wheels and rattling gear that they are capable of threshing
      should anything be provided for them. The poor Althams were
      somewhat in this position, for their rations of gossip were
      sadly reduced, their two chief sources being cut off from
      them. For ever since the mendacious Mrs. Brooks had
      appeared as Cleopatra, when she had as good as promised to
      be Hermione, chill politeness had taken the place of
      intimacy between the two houses, since there was no telling
      what trick she might not play next, while the very decided
      line which Mrs. Altham had taken when she found she was
      expected to meet people like tradesmen's wives had caused a
      complete rupture in relations with the Ames'. That
      Suffragette meetings were going on was certain, else what
      sane mind could account for the fact that only to-day a
      perfect stream of people, some of them not even known by
      sight to Mrs. Altham, and therefore probably of the very
      lowest origin, with Mrs. Ames and the wife of the
      station-master among them, had been seen coming out of Mr.
      Turner's warehouse. It was ridiculous "to tell me" that
      they had been all making purchases (nobody had told her),
      and such a supposition was thoroughly negatived by the
      subsequent discovery that the warehouse in question
      contained only a quantity of chairs. All this, however, had
      been threshed out at tea-time, and the fly-wheels buzzed
      emptily. Against the probability of an
      election-demonstration was the fact that the Unionist
      member, to whom these attentions would naturally be
      directed, was Mrs. Ames' cousin, though "cousin" was a
      vague word, and Mrs. Altham would not wonder if he was a
      very distant sort of cousin indeed. Still, it would be
      worth while to get tickets anyhow for the first of Sir
      James' meetings, when the President of the Board of Trade
      was going to speak, so as to be certain of a good place.
      <i>He</i> was not Mrs. Ames' cousin, so far as Mrs. Altham
      knew, though she did not pretend to follow the
      ramifications of Mrs. Ames' family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fly-wheels were allowed to run on in silence for some
      little while after this meagre material had been thoroughly
      sifted, in case anything further offered itself; then Mr.
      Altham proposed another topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were saying that you wondered how Mrs. Evans got
      through her time," he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no need for him to say another word, nor any
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham stooped like a hawk on the quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Major Ames," she said. "I'm sure I never pass the
      house but what he's either going in or coming out, and he
      does a good deal more of the going in than of the other, in
      my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry penetrated into the meaning of what sounded a rather
      curious achievement and corroborated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was there this morning," he said, "on the doorstep at
      eleven o'clock, or it might have been a quarter-past, with
      a bouquet of chrysanthemums big enough to do all Mrs. Ames'
      decorations at St. Barnabas. What is the matter, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Altham had literally bounced out of her chair, and
      was pointing at him a forefinger that trembled with a
      nameless emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a quarter-past one, or a few minutes later," she said,
      "that bouquet was lying in the middle of the road. Let us
      say twenty minutes past one, because I came straight home,
      took off my hat, and was ready for lunch. It was more like
      a haystack than a bouquet: I'm sure if I hadn't stepped
      over it, I should have tripped and fallen. And to think
      that I never mentioned it to you, Henry! How things piece
      themselves together, if you give them a chance! Now did you
      actually see Major Ames carry it into the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The door was opened to him, just as I came opposite," said
      Henry firmly, "and in he went, bouquet and all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then somebody <i>must</i> have thrown it out again," said
      Mrs. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up one hand, and ticked off names on its fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was then in the house?" she said. "Mrs. Evans, Dr.
      Evans, Major Ames. Otherwise the servants--how they can
      find work for six servants in that house I can't
      understand--and servants would never have thrown
      chrysanthemums into the street. So we needn't count the
      servants. Now can you imagine Mrs. Evans throwing away a
      bouquet that Major Ames had brought her? If so, I envy you
      your power of imagination. Or--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or can there have been a quarrel, and did she tell him she
      had too much of him and his bouquets? Or--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Evans," said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded portentously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turned out of the house, he and his bouquet," she said.
      "Dr. Evans is a powerful man, and Major Ames, for all his
      size, is mostly fat. I should not wonder if Dr. Evans
      knocked him down. Henry, I have a good mind to treat Mrs.
      Ames as if she had not been so insulting to me that day
      (and after all that is only Christian conduct) and to take
      round to her after lunch to-morrow the book she said she
      wanted to see last July. I am sure I have forgotten what it
      was, but any book will do, since she only wants it to be
      thought that she reads. After all, I should be sorry to let
      Mrs. Ames suppose that anything she can do should have the
      power of putting me out, and I should like to see if she
      still dyes her hair. After the chrysanthemums in the road I
      should not be the least surprised to be told that Major
      Ames is ill. Then we shall know all. Dear me, it is eleven
      o'clock already, and I never felt less inclined to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stepped downstairs to drink a mild whisky and soda
      after all this conversation and excitement, but while it
      was still half drunk, he felt compelled to run upstairs and
      tap at his wife's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not coming in, dear," he said, in answer to her
      impassioned negative. "But if you find Major Ames is not
      ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one will be more rejoiced than myself, Henry," said
      she, in a disappointed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry went gently downstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames was at home when the forgiving Mrs. Altham
      arrived on the following afternoon, bearing a copy of a
      book of which there were already two examples in the house.
      But she clearly remembered having wanted to see some book
      of which they had spoken together, last July, and it was
      very kind of Mrs. Altham to have attempted to supply her
      with it. Beyond doubt she had ceased to dye her hair, for
      the usual grey streaks were apparent in it, a proof (if
      Mrs. Altham wanted a proof, which she did not) that
      artificial means had been resorted to. And even as Mrs.
      Altham, with her powerful observation, noticed the
      difference in Mrs. Ames' hair, so also she noticed a
      difference in Mrs. Ames. She no longer seemed pompous:
      there was a kindliness about her which was utterly unlike
      her usual condescension, though it manifested itself only
      in the trivial happenings of an afternoon call, such as
      putting a cushion in her chair, and asking if she found the
      room, with its prospering fire, too hot. This also led to
      interesting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is scarcely cold enough for a fire to-day," she said,
      "but my husband is laid up with a little attack of
      lumbago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so sorry to hear that," said Mrs. Altham feverishly.
      "When did he catch it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He felt it first last night before dinner. It is
      disappointing, for he expected Harrogate to cure him of
      such tendencies. But it is not very severe: I have no doubt
      he will be in here presently for tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham felt quite convinced he would not, and hastened
      to glean further enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be very busy thinking of the election," she said.
      "I suppose Sir James is safe to get in. I got tickets for
      the first of his meetings this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be the one at which the President of the Board
      of Trade speaks," said Mrs. Ames. "My cousin and he dine
      with us first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham determined on more direct questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, it must require courage to be a politician
      nowadays," she said, "especially if you are in the Cabinet.
      Mr. Chilcot has been hardly able to open his mouth lately
      without being interrupted by some Suffragette. Dear me, I
      hope I have not said the wrong thing! I quite forgot your
      sympathies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is certainly a subject that interests me," said Mrs.
      Ames, "though as for saying the wrong thing, dear Mrs.
      Altham, why, the world would be a very dull place if we all
      agreed with each other. But I think it requires just as
      much courage for a woman to get up at a meeting and
      interrupt. I cannot imagine myself being bold enough. I
      feel I should be unable to get on my feet, or utter a word.
      They must be very much in earnest, and have a great deal of
      conviction to nerve them."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not very satisfactory; if anything was to be
      learned from it, it was that Mrs. Ames was but a tepid
      supporter of the cause. But what followed was still more
      vexing, for the parlour-maid announced Mrs. Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sorry to hear about Major Ames, dear cousin Amy," she
      said. "Wilfred told me he had been to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames made a kissing-pad, so to speak, of her small
      toad's face, and Millie dabbed her cheek on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Millie, how nice of you to call! Parker, tell the
      Major that tea is ready, and that Mrs. Evans and Mrs.
      Altham are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the time Major Ames arrived Mrs. Altham was there no
      longer. She was thoroughly disgusted with the
      transformation into chaff of all the beautiful grain that
      they had taken the trouble to thresh out the night before.
      She summed it up succinctly to her husband when he came
      back from his golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe the Suffragettes are going to do anything
      at all, Henry," she said, "and I shouldn't wonder if these
      chrysanthemums had nothing to do with anybody. The only
      thing is that her hair is dyed, because it was all speckled
      with grey again as thickly as yours, and I declare I left
      <i>The Safety of the Race</i> behind me, instead of
      bringing it back again, as I meant to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, who had won his match at golf, was naturally
      optimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you didn't actually see Major Ames?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but there was no longer any doubt about it all," she
      said. "I do not think I am unduly credulous, but it was
      clear there was nothing the matter with him except a touch
      of lumbago. And all this Suffragette business means nothing
      at all, in spite of the yards of riband. You may take my
      word for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there will be no point in going to Sir James'
      meeting," said Henry, "though the President of the Board of
      Trade is going to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless you want to hear the biggest windbag in the
      country buttering up the greatest prig in the county. I
      should be sorry to waste my time over it; and he is dining
      with the Ames', and so I suppose all there will be to look
      at will be the row of them on the platform, all swollen
      with one of Mrs. Ames' biggest dinners. We might have gone
      to bed at our usual time last night, for all the use that
      there has been in our talk. And it was you saw the
      chrysanthemums, from which you expected so much and thought
      it worth while to tell me about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Henry felt too much depressed at the utter flatness of
      all that had made so fair a promise, to enter any protest
      against the palpable injustice of these conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames' lumbago was of the Laodicean sort, neither hot
      nor cold. It hung about, occasionally stabbing him
      shrewdly, at times retreating in the Parthian mode, so that
      he was encouraged to drink a glass of port, upon which it
      shot at him again, and he had to get back to his stew of
      sloppy diet and depressing reflections. Most of all, the
      relations into which he had allowed himself to drift with
      regard to Millie filled him with a timorous yet exultant
      agitation, but he almost, if not quite, exaggerated his
      indisposition, in order to escape from the responsibility
      of deciding what should come of it. Damp and boisterous
      weather made it prudent for him to keep to the house, and
      she came to see him daily. Behind her demure quietness he
      divined a mind that was expectant and sure: there was no
      doubt as to her view of the situation that had arisen
      between them. She had played with the emotions of others
      once too often, and was caught in the agitation which she
      had so often excited without sharing in it. Mrs. Ames was
      generally present at these visits, but when it was quite
      certain that she was not looking, Millie often raised her
      eyes to his, and this disconcerting conviction lurked
      behind them. Her speech was equally disconcerting, for she
      would say, "It will be nice when you are well again," in a
      manner that quite belied the commonplace words. And this
      force that lay behind strangely controlled him.
      Involuntarily, almost, he answered her signals, gave
      himself the lover-like privilege of seeming to understand
      all that was not said. All the time, too, he perfectly
      appreciated the bad taste of the affair--namely, that a
      woman who was in love with him, and to whom he had given
      indications of the most unmistakable kind that he was on
      her plane of emotion, should play these unacted scenes in
      his wife's house, coming there to make pass his invalid
      hours, and that he should take his part in them. It was
      common, and he could not but contrast that commonness with
      the unconsciousness of his wife. Occasionally he was
      inclined to think, "Poor Amy, how little she sees," but as
      often it occurred to him that she was too big to be aware
      of such smallnesses as he and Millie were guilty of. And,
      in reality, the truth lay between these extreme views. She
      was not too big to be aware of it; she was quite aware of
      it, but she was big enough to appear too big to be aware of
      it. She watched, and scorned herself for her watching. She
      fed herself with suspicions, but was robust enough to spew
      them forth again. Also, and this allowed the robuster
      attitude to flourish, she was concerned with a nightmare of
      her own which daily grew more vivid and unescapable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A decade of streaming October days passed in this trying
      atmosphere of suspicion and uncertainty and apprehension.
      Of the three of them it was Major Ames who was most
      thoroughly ill at ease, for he had no inspiration which
      enabled him to bear this sordid martyrdom. He divined that
      Millie was evolving some situation in which he would be
      expected to play a very prominent part, and such ardour as
      was his he felt not to be of the adequate temperature, and
      he looked back over the peaceful days when his garden
      supplied him not only with flowers, but with the most
      poignant emotions known to his nature, almost with regret.
      It had all been so peaceful and pleasant in that
      land-locked harbour, and now she, like a steam-tug, was
      slowly towing him out past the pier-head into a waste of
      breakers. Strictly speaking, it was possible for him at any
      moment to cast the towing-rope off and return to his quiet
      anchorage, but he was afraid he lacked the moral power to
      do so. He had let her throw the rope aboard him, he had
      helped to attach it to the bollard, thinking, so to speak,
      that he was the tug and she the frail little craft. But
      that frail little craft had developed into an engined
      apparatus, and it was his turn to be towed, helpless and at
      least unwilling, and wholly uninspired. The others, at any
      rate, had inspiration to warm their discomfort: Mrs. Ames
      the sense of justice and sisterhood which was leavening her
      dumpy existence, Mrs. Evans the fire which, however strange
      and illicit are its burnings, however common and trivial
      the material from which it springs, must still be called
      love.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of Sir James' first meeting, and Mrs.
      Ames at six o'clock was satisfying herself that nothing had
      been omitted in the preparations for dinner. The printed
      menu-cards were in place, announcing all that was most
      sumptuous; the requisite relays of knives, spoons and forks
      were on the sideboard; the plates of opalescent glass for
      ice were to hand, and there was no longer anything
      connected with this terrible feast, that to her had the
      horror of a murderer's breakfast on the last morning of his
      life, which could serve to distract her mind any more.
      Millie was to dine with them and with them come to the
      meeting, but just now it did not seem to matter in the
      slightest what Millie did. All day Mrs. Ames had been
      catching at problematic straws that might save her: it was
      possible that Mr. Chilcot would be seized with sudden
      indisposition, and the meeting be postponed. But she
      herself had seen him drive by in Cousin James' motor,
      looking particularly hearty. Or Cousin James might catch
      influenza: Lady Westbourne already had it, and it was
      pleasantly infectious. Or Lyndhurst might get an attack of
      really acute lumbago, but instead he felt absolutely well
      again to-day, and had even done a little garden-rolling.
      One by one these bright possibilities had been
      extinguished--now no reasonable anchor remained except that
      dinner would acutely disagree with her (and that was hardly
      likely, since she felt incapable of eating anything) or
      that the motor which was to take them to the town hall
      would break down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past six she went upstairs to dress; she would thus
      secure a quarter of an hour before the actual operation of
      decking herself began, in which to be alone and really face
      what was going to happen. It was no use trying to face it
      in one piece: taken all together the coming evening had the
      horror and unreality of nightmare brooding over it. She had
      to take it moment by moment from the time when she would
      welcome her guests, whom, so it seemed to her, she was then
      going to betray, till the time when, perhaps four hours
      from now, she would be back again here in her room, and
      everything that had happened had woven itself into the
      woolly texture of the past, in place of being in the
      steely, imminent future. There was dinner to be gone
      through; that was only tolerable to think of because of
      what was to follow: in itself it would please her to
      entertain her cousin and so notable a man as a Cabinet
      Minister. Clearly, then, she must separate dinner from the
      rest, and enjoy it independently. But when she went down to
      dinner she must have left here in readiness the little
      black velvet bag . . . that was not so pleasant to think
      of. Yet the little black velvet bag had nothing to do yet.
      Then there would follow the drive to the town hall: that
      would not be unpleasant: in itself she would rather enjoy
      the stir and pomp of their arrival. Sir James would
      doubtless say to the scrutinizing doorkeeper, "These ladies
      are with me," and they would pass on amid demonstrations of
      deference. Probably there would be a little procession on
      to the platform . . . the Mayor would very likely lead the
      way with her, her and her little black velvet bag . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And then poor Mrs. Ames suddenly felt that if she thought
      about it any more she would have a nervous collapse. And at
      that thought her inspiration, so to speak, reached out a
      cool, firm hand to her. At any cost she was going through
      with this nightmare for the sake of that which inspired it.
      It was no use saying it was pleasant, nor was it pleasant
      to have a tooth out. But any woman with the slightest
      self-respect, when once convinced that it was better to
      have the tooth out, went to the dentist at the appointed
      hour, declined gas (Mrs. Ames had very decided opinions
      about those who made a fuss over a little pain), opened her
      mouth, and held the arms of the chair very firmly. One
      wanted something to hold on to at these moments. She
      wondered what she would find to hold on to this evening.
      Perhaps the holding on would be done by somebody else--a
      policeman, for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one more detail to attend to before dressing, and
      she opened the little black velvet bag. In it were two
      chains--light, but of steel: they had been sold her with
      the gratifying recommendation that either of them alone
      would hold a mastiff, which was more than was required. One
      was of such length as to go tightly round her waist: a
      spring lock with hasp passing through the last link of it,
      closing with an internal snap, obviated the necessity of a
      key. This she proposed to put on below the light cloak she
      wore before they started. The second chain was rather
      longer but otherwise similar. It was to be passed through
      the one already in place on her waist, and round the object
      to which she desired to attach herself. Another snap lock
      made the necessary connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that all was in order and, putting the big
      Suffragette rosette on top of the other apparatus, closed
      the bag: it was useless to try to accustom herself to it by
      looking; she might as well inspect the dentist's forceps,
      hoping thus to mollify their grip. Cloak and little velvet
      bag she would leave here and come up for them after dinner.
      And already the quarter of an hour was over, and it was
      time to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daring rose-coloured silk was to be worn on this
      occasion, and she hoped that it would not experience any
      rough treatment. Yet it hardly mattered: after to-night she
      would very likely never care to set eyes on it again, and
      emphatically Lyndhurst would find it full of disagreeable
      associations. And then she felt suddenly and acutely sorry
      for him and for the amazement and chagrin that he was about
      to feel. He could not fail to be burningly ashamed of her,
      to choke with rage and mortification. Perhaps it would
      bring on another attack of lumbago, which she would
      intensely regret. But she did not anticipate feeling in the
      least degree ashamed of herself. But she intensely wished
      it had not got to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she was ready: the rose-coloured silk glowed softly
      in the electric light, the pink satin shoes which "went
      with it" were on her plump, pretty little feet, the row of
      garnets was clasped round her neck. There was a good deal
      of colour in her face, and she was pleased to see she
      looked so well. The last time she had worn all these fine
      feathers was on the evening she returned home with brown
      hair and softened wrinkles from Overstrand. That was not a
      successful evening: it seemed that the rose-coloured silk
      was destined to shine on inauspicious scenes. But now she
      was ready: this was her last moment alone. And she plumped
      down on her knees by the bedside, in a sudden of despair at
      what lay before her, and found her lips involuntarily
      repeating the words that were used in the hugest and most
      holy agony that man's spirit has ever known, when for one
      moment He felt that even He could not face the sacrifice of
      Himself or to drink of the cup. But next moment she sprang
      from her knees again, her face all aflame with shame at her
      paltriness. "You wretched little coward!" she said to
      herself. "How dare you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner, that long expensive dinner, brought with it trouble
      unanticipated by Mrs. Ames. Mr. Chilcot, it appeared, was a
      teetotaler at all times, and never ate anything but a
      couple of poached eggs before he made a speech. He was
      also, owing to recent experiences, a little nervous about
      Suffragettes, and required reiterated assurances that
      unaccountable females had not been seen about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true that a week or two ago I received a letter
      asking me my views," said Sir James, "but I wrote a fairly
      curt reply, and have heard nothing more about it. My
      agent's pretty wide awake. He would have known if there was
      likely to be any disturbance. No thanks, Major, one glass
      of champagne is all I allow myself before making a speech.
      Capital wine, I know; I always say you give one the best
      glass of wine to be had in Kent. How's time, by the way?
      Ah, we've got plenty of time yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like to have five minutes' quiet before going on to the
      platform," said Mr. Chilcot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that will be all right. Perhaps we might have the
      motor five minutes earlier, Cousin Amy. No, no sweetbread
      thanks. Dear me, what a great dinner you are giving us."
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful and dismal atmosphere descended. Mr. Chilcot,
      thinking of his speech, frowned at his poached eggs, and,
      when they were finished, at the table-cloth. Cousin James
      refused dish after dish, Mrs. Ames felt herself incapable
      of eating, and Major Ames and Mrs. Evans, who was
      practically a vegetarian, were left to do the carousing.
      Wines went round untouched, silences grew longer, and an
      interminable succession of dishes failed to tempt anybody
      except Major Ames. At this rate, not one, but a whole
      series of luncheon-parties would be necessary to finish up
      the untouched dainties of this ill-starred dinner. Outside,
      a brisk tattoo of rain beat on the windows, and the wind
      having got up, the fire began to smoke, and Mr. Chilcot to
      cough. A readjustment of door and window mended this
      matter, but sluiced Cousin James in a chilly draught. Mr.
      Chilcot brightened up a little as coffee came round, but
      the coffee was the only weak spot in an admirable repast,
      being but moderately warm. He put it down. Mrs. Ames tried
      to repair this error.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it is not hot enough," she said. "Parker, tell
      them to heat it up at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin James looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, I think we ought to be off," he said. "I'm sure
      they can get a cup of coffee for Mr. Chilcot from the
      hotel. We might all go together unless you have ordered
      something, Cousin Amy. The motor holds five easily."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A smart, chill October rain was falling, and they drove
      through blurred and disconsolate streets. A few figures
      under umbrellas went swiftly along the cheerless pavements,
      a crowd of the very smallest dimensions, scarce two deep
      across the pavement opposite the town hall, watched the
      arrival of those who were attending the meeting. There was
      an insignificant queue of half-a-dozen carriages awaiting
      their disembarkments, but as the hands of the town hall
      clock indicated that the meeting was not timed to begin for
      twenty minutes yet, even Mr. Chilcot could not get agitated
      about the possibility of a cup of coffee before his effort.
      Through the rain-streaked windows Mrs. Ames could see how
      meagre, owing no doubt to the inclement night, was the
      assembly of the ticket-holders. It was possible, of course,
      that crowds might soon begin to arrive, but Riseborough
      generally made a point of being in its place in plenty of
      time, and she anticipated a sparsely attended room. Mrs.
      Brooks hurried by in mackintosh and goloshes, the cheerful
      Turner family, who were just behind them in a cab, dived
      into the wet night, and emerged again under the awning.
      Mrs. Currie (wife of the station-master), with her
      Suffragette rosette in a paper parcel, had a friendly word
      with a policeman at the door, and at these sights, since
      they indicated a forcible assemblage of the league, she
      felt a little encouraged. Then the car moved on and stopped
      again opposite the awning, and their party dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bustling official demanded their tickets, and was
      summarily thrust aside by another, just as bustling but
      more enlightened, who had recognized Sir James, and
      conducted them all to the Mayor's parlour, where that
      dignitary received them. There was coffee already provided,
      and all anxiety on that score was removed. Mr. Chilcot
      effaced himself in a corner with his cup and his notes,
      while the others, notably Sir James, behaved with that
      mixture of social condescension and official deference
      which appears to be the right attitude in dealing with
      mayors. Then the Mayoress said, "George, dear, it has gone
      the half-hour; will you escort Mrs. Ames?"
    </p>
    <p>
      George asked Mrs. Ames if he might have the honour, and
      observed--
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have but a thin meeting, I am afraid. Most
      inclement for October."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Ames pulled her cloak a little closer round her, in
      order to hide a chain that was more significant than the
      Mayor's, and felt the little black velvet bag beating time
      to her steps against her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked through the stark bare passages, with stone
      floors that exuded cold moisture in sympathy with the
      wetness of the evening, and came out into a sudden blaze of
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint applause from nearly empty benches heralded their
      appearance, and they disposed themselves on a row of plush
      arm-chairs behind a long oak table. The Mayor sat in the
      centre, to right and left of him Sir James and Mr. Chilcot.
      Just opposite Mrs. Ames was a large table-leg, which had
      for her the significance of the execution-shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her bag conveniently on her knees, and quietly
      unloosed the latch that fastened it. There were no more
      preparations to be made just yet, since the chain was quite
      ready, and in a curious irresponsible calm she took further
      note of her surroundings. Scarcely a hundred people were
      there, all told, and face after face, as she passed her
      eyes down the seats, was friendly and familiar. Mrs. Currie
      bowed, and the Turner family, in a state of the pleasantest
      excitement, beamed; Mrs. Brooks gave her an excited
      hand-wave. They were all sitting in encouraging vicinity to
      each other, but she was alone, as on the inexorable seas,
      while they were on the pier . . . Then the Mayor cleared
      his throat.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It had been arranged that the Mayor was to be given an
      uninterrupted hearing, for he was the local grocer, and it
      had, perhaps, been tacitly felt that he might adopt
      retaliatory measures in the inferior quality of the
      subsequent supplies of sugar. He involved himself in
      sentences that had no end, and would probably have gone on
      for ever, had he not, with commendable valour, chopped off
      their tails when their coils threatened to strangle him,
      and begun again. The point of it all was that they had the
      honour to welcome the President of the Board of Trade and
      Sir James Westbourne. Luckily, the posters, with which the
      town had been placarded for the last fortnight,
      corroborated the information, and no reasonable person
      could any longer doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rejoiced to see so crowded an assembly met
      together--this was not very happy, but the sentence had
      been carefully thought out, and it was a pity not to
      reproduce it--and was convinced that they would all spend a
      most interesting and enjoyable evening, which would
      certainly prove to be epoch-making. Politics were taken
      seriously in Riseborough, and it was pleasant to see the
      gathering graced by so many members of the fair sex. He
      felt he had detained them all quite long enough (no) and he
      would detain them no longer (yes), but call on the Right
      Honourable Mr. Chilcot (cheers).
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Chilcot rose, Mr. Turner rose also, and said in a
      clear, cheerful voice, "Votes for Women." He had a rosette,
      pinned a little crookedly, depending from his shoulder.
      Immediately his wife and daughter rose too, and in a sort
      of Gregorian chant said, "Women's rights," and a rattle of
      chains made a pleasant light accompaniment. From beneath
      her seat Mrs. Currie produced a banner trimmed with the
      appropriate colours, on which was embroidered "Votes for
      Women." But the folds clung dispiritingly together: there
      was never a more dejected banner. Two stalwart porters whom
      she had brought with her also got up, wiped their mouths
      with the backs of their hands, and said in low, hoarse
      tones, "Votes for Women."
    </p>
    <p>
      This lasted but a few seconds, and there was silence again.
      It was impossible to imagine a less impressive
      demonstration: it seemed the incarnation of
      ineffectiveness. Mr. Chilcot had instantly sat down when it
      began, and, though he had cause to be shy of Suffragettes,
      seemed quite undisturbed; he was smiling good-naturedly,
      and for a moment consulted his notes again. And then,
      suddenly, Mrs. Ames realized that she had taken no share in
      it; it had begun so quickly, and so quickly ended, that for
      the time she had merely watched. But then her blood and her
      courage came back to her: it should not be her fault, in
      any case, if the proceedings lacked fire. The Idea, all
      that had meant so much to her during these last months,
      seemed to stand by her, asking her aid. She opened the
      little black velvet bag, pinned on her rosette, passed the
      second chain (strong enough to hold a mastiff) through the
      first, and round the leg of the table in front of her,
      heard the spring lock click, and rose to her feet, waving
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Votes for Women!" she cried. "Votes for Women. Hurrah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly every one on the platform turned to her: she saw
      Lyndhurst's inflamed and astonished face, with mouth fallen
      open in incredulous surprise, like a fish in an aquarium:
      she saw Cousin James' frown of distinguished horror. Mrs.
      Evans looked as if about to laugh, and the Mayoress said,
      "Lor'!" Mr. Chilcot turned round in his seat, and his
      good-humoured smile faded, leaving an angry fighting face.
      But all this hostility and amazement, so far from cowing or
      silencing her, seemed like a draught of wine. "Votes for
      Women!" she cried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that the cry was taken up in earnest: by a desperate
      effort Mrs. Currie unfurled her banner, so that it floated
      free, her porters roared out their message with the
      conviction they put into their announcements to a stopping
      train that this was Riseborough, the Turner family
      gleefully shouted together: Mrs. Brooks, unable to adjust
      her rosette, madly waved it, and a solid group of
      enthusiasts just below the platform emitted loud and
      militant cries. All that had been flat and lifeless a
      moment before was inspired and vital. And Mrs. Ames had
      done it. For a moment she had nothing but glory in her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chilcot leaned over the table to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no idea," he said, "when I had the honour of dining
      with you that you proposed immediately afterwards to treat
      me with such gross discourtesy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Votes for Women!" shouted Mrs. Ames again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the cry was less vehemently taken up, for there
      was nothing to interrupt. Mr. Chilcot conferred a moment
      quietly with Sir James, and Mrs. Ames saw that Lyndhurst
      and Mrs. Evans were talking together: the former was
      spluttering with rage, and Mrs. Evans had laid her slim,
      white-gloved hand on his knee, in the attempt, it appeared,
      to soothe him. At present the endeavour did not seem to be
      meeting with any notable measure of success. Even in the
      midst of her excitement, Mrs, Ames thought how ludicrous
      Lyndhurst's face was; she also felt sorry for him. As well,
      she had the sense of this being tremendous fun: never in
      her life had she been so effective, never had she even for
      a moment paralysed the plans of other people. But she was
      doing that now; Mr. Chilcot had come here to speak, and she
      was not permitting him to. And again she cried "Votes for
      Women!"
    </p>
    <p>
      An inspector of police had come on to the platform, and
      after a few words with Sir James, he vaulted down into the
      body of the hall. Next moment, some dozen policemen tramped
      in from outside, and immediately afterwards the Turner
      family, still beaming, were being trundled down the
      gangway, and firmly ejected. Sundry high notes and muffled
      shoutings came from outside, but after a few seconds they
      were dumb, as if a tap had been turned off. There was a
      little more trouble with Mrs. Currie, but a few smart tugs
      brought away the somewhat flimsy wooden rail to which she
      had attached herself, and she was taken along in a sort of
      tripping step, like a cheerful dancing bear, with her
      chains jingling round her, after the Turners, and quietly
      put out into the night. Then Sir James came across to Mrs.
      Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin Amy," he said, "you must please give us your word
      to cause no more disturbance, or I shall tell a couple of
      men to take you away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Votes for Women!" shouted Mrs. Ames again. But the
      excitement which possessed her was rapidly dying, and from
      the hall there came no response except very audible
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry," said Cousin James
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a sudden overwhelming wave, the futility of
      the whole thing struck her. What had she done? She had
      merely been extremely rude to her two guests, had seriously
      annoyed her husband, and had aroused perfectly justifiable
      laughter. General Fortescue was sitting a few rows off: he
      was looking at her through his pince-nez, and his red,
      good-humoured face was all a-chink with smiles. Then two
      policemen, one of whom had his beat in St. Barnabas Road,
      vaulted up on to the platform, and several people left
      their places to look on from a more advantageous position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg your pardon, ma'am," said the St. Barnabas policeman,
      touching his helmet with imperturbable politeness. "She's
      chained up too, Bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill was a slow, large, fatherly-looking man, and examined
      Mrs. Ames' fetters. Then a broad grin broke out over his
      amiable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only just passed around the table-leg," he said.
      "Hitch up the table-leg, mate, and slip it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too true . . . patent lock and mastiff-holding chain
      were slipped down the table-leg, and Mrs. Ames, with the
      fatherly-looking policeman politely carrying her chains and
      the little velvet bag, was gently and inevitably propelled
      through the door which, a quarter of an hour ago, she had
      entered escorted by the Mayor, and down the stone passage
      and out into the dripping street. The rain fell heavily on
      to the rose-coloured silk dress, and the fatherly policeman
      put her cloak, which had half fallen off, more shelteringly
      round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better have a cab, ma'am, and go home quietly," he said.
      "You'll catch cold if you stay here, and we can't let you
      in again, begging your pardon, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames looked round: Mrs. Currie was just crossing the
      road, apparently on her way home, and a carriage drove off
      containing the Turner family. A sense of utter failure and
      futility possessed her: it was cold and wet, and a chilly
      wind flapped the awning, blowing a shower of dripping
      raindrops on to her. The excitement and courage that had
      possessed her just now had all oozed away: nothing had been
      effected, unless to make herself ridiculous could be
      counted as an achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call a cab for the lady, Bill," said her policeman
      soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was soon summoned, and Bill touched his helmet as she
      got in, and before closing the door pulled up the window
      for her. The cabman also knew her, and there was no need to
      give him her address. The rain pattered on the windows and
      on the roof, and the horse splashed briskly along through
      the puddles in the roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker opened the door to her, surprised at the speediness
      of her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, ma'am!" she exclaimed, "has anything happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing, Parker," said she, feeling that a dreadful
      truth underlay her words. "Tell the Major, when he comes
      in, that I have gone to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked for a moment into the dining-room. So short a
      time had passed that the table was not yet cleared: the
      printed menu-cards had been collected, but the coffee,
      which had not been hot enough, still stood untasted in the
      cups, and the slices of pineapple, cut, but not eaten, were
      ruinously piled together. The thought of all the luncheons
      that would be necessary to consume all this expensive food
      made her feel sick. . . . These little things had assumed a
      ridiculous size to her mind; that which had seemed so big
      was pitifully dwindled. She felt desperately tired, and
      cold and lonely.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "And what's to be done now?" said Major Ames, chipping his
      bacon high into the air above his plate. "If you didn't
      hear me, I said, 'What's to be done now?' I don't know how
      you can look Riseborough in the face again, and, upon my
      word, I don't see how I can. They'll point at me in the
      street, and say, 'That's Major Ames, whose wife made a fool
      of herself.' That's what you did, Amy. You made a fool of
      yourself. And what was the good of it all? Are you any
      nearer getting the vote than before, because you've
      screamed 'Votes for Women' a dozen times? You've only given
      a proof the more of how utterly unfit you are to have
      anything at all of your own, let alone a vote. I passed a
      sleepless night with thinking of your folly, and I feel
      infernally unwell this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      This clearly constituted a climax, and Mrs. Ames took
      advantage of the rhetorical pause that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Lyndhurst," she said; "I heard you snoring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's enough to make a man snore," he said. "Snore, indeed!
      Why couldn't you even have told me that you were going to
      behave like a silly lunatic, and if I couldn't have
      persuaded you to behave sanely, I could have stopped away,
      instead of looking on at such an exhibition? Every one will
      suppose I must have known about it, and have countenanced
      you. I've a good mind to write to the <i>Kent Chronicle</i>
      and say that I was absolutely ignorant of what you were
      going to do. You've disgraced us; that's what you've done."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a gulp of tea, imprudently, for it was much hotter
      than he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now I've burned my mouth!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames put down her napkin, left her seat, and came and
      stood by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry you are so much vexed," she said, "but I can't
      and I won't discuss anything with you if you talk like
      that. You are thinking about nothing but yourself, whether
      you are disgraced, and whether you have had a bad night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly you don't seem to have thought about me," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact I did," she said. "I knew you would
      not like it, and I was sorry. But do you suppose I liked
      it? But I thought most about the reason for which I did
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did it for notoriety," said Major Ames, with
      conviction. "You wanted to see your name in the papers, as
      having interrupted a Cabinet Minister's speech. You won't
      even have that satisfaction, I am glad to say. Your cousin
      James, who is a decent sort of fellow after all, spoke to
      the reporters last night and asked them to leave out all
      account of the disturbance. They consented; they are decent
      fellows too; they didn't want to give publicity to your
      folly. They were sorry for you, Amy; and how do you like
      half-a-dozen reporters at a pound a week being sorry for
      you? Your cousin James was equally generous. He bore no
      malice to me, and shook hands with me, and said he saw you
      were unwell when he sat down to dinner. But when a man of
      the world, as your Cousin James is, says he thinks that a
      woman is unwell, I know what he means. He thought you were
      intoxicated. Drunk, in fact. That's what he thought. He
      thought you were drunk. My wife drunk. And it was the
      kindest interpretation he could have put upon it. Mad or
      drunk. He chose drunk. And he hoped I should be able to
      come over some day next week and help him to thin out the
      pheasants. Very friendly, considering all that had
      happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames moved slightly away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to go?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I mean to go. He shows a very generous spirit,
      and I think I can account for the highest of his
      rocketters. He wants to smooth things over and be generous,
      and all that--hold out the olive branch. He recognizes that
      I've got to live down your folly, and if it's known that
      I've been shooting with him, it will help us. Forgive and
      forget, hey? I shall just go over there, <i>en garon,</i>
      and will patch matters up. I dare say he'll ask you over
      again some time. He doesn't want to be hard on you. Nor do
      I, I am sure. But there are things no man can stand. A
      man's got to put his foot down sometimes, even if he puts
      it down on his wife. And if I was a bit rough with you just
      now, you must realize, Amy, you must realize that I felt
      strongly, strongly and rightly. We've got to live down what
      you have done. Well, I'm by you. We'll live it down
      together. I'll make your peace with your cousin. You can
      trust me."
    </p>
    <p>
      These magnificent assurances failed to dazzle Mrs. Ames,
      and she made no acknowledgment of them. Instead, she went
      back rather abruptly and inconveniently to a previous
      topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell me that Cousin James believed I was drunk," she
      said. "Now you knew I was not. But you seem to have let it
      pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames felt that more magnanimous assurances might be
      in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are some things best passed over," he said. "Let
      sleeping dogs lie. I think the less we talk about last
      night the better. I hope I am generous enough not to want
      to rub it in, Amy, not to make you more uncomfortable than
      you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames sat down in a chair by the fireplace. A huge fire
      burned there, altogether disproportionate to the day, and
      she screened her face from the blaze with the morning
      paper. Also she made a mental note to speak to Parker about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making me very uncomfortable indeed, Lyndhurst,"
      she said; "by not telling me what I ask you. Did you let it
      pass, when you saw James thought I was drunk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he didn't say so in so many words. If he had said so,
      well, I dare say I should have--have made some sort of
      answer. And, mind you, it was no accusation he made against
      you; he made an excuse for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames' small, insignificant face grew suddenly very
      firm and fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not need to go into that," she said. "You saw he
      thought I was drunk, and said nothing. And after that you
      mean to go over and shoot his pheasants. Is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly it is. You are making a mountain out of--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am making no mountain out of anything. Personally, I
      don't believe Cousin James thought anything of the kind.
      What matters is that you let it pass. What matters is that
      I should have to tell you that you must apologize to me,
      instead of your seeing it for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames got up, pushing his chair violently back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here's a pretty state of things," he cried; "that
      you should be telling me to apologize for last night's
      degrading exhibition! I wonder what you'll be asking next?
      A vote of thanks from the Mayor, I shouldn't wonder, and an
      illuminated address. You teaching me what I ought to do! I
      should have thought a woman would have been only too glad
      to trust to her husband, if he was so kind, as I have been,
      as to want to get her out of the consequences of her folly.
      And now it's you who must sit there, opposite a fire fit to
      roast an ox, and tell me I must apologize. Apologies be
      damned! There! It's not my habit to swear, as you well
      know, but there are occasions--Apologies be damned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And a moment later the house shook with the thunder of the
      slammed front door.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames sat for a couple of minutes exactly where she
      was, still shielding her face from the fire. She felt all
      the chilling effects of the reaction that follows on
      excitement, whether the excitement is rapturous or as
      sickening as last night's had been, but not for a moment
      did she regret her share either in the events of the
      evening before or in the sequel of this morning. Last night
      had ended in utter fiasco, but she had done her best; this
      morning's talk had ended in a pretty sharp quarrel, but
      again she found it impossible to reconsider her share in
      it. Humanly she felt beaten and ridiculed and sick at
      heart, but not ashamed. She had passed a sleepless night,
      and was horribly tired, with that tiredness that seems to
      sap all pluck and power of resistance, and gradually her
      eyes grew dim, and the difficult meagre tears of middle
      age, which are so bitter, began to roll down her cheeks,
      and the hard inelastic sobs to rise in her throat. . . .
      Yet it was no use sitting here crying, lunch and dinner had
      to be ordered whether she felt unhappy or not; she had to
      see how extensive was the damage done to her pink satin
      shoes by the wet pavements last night; she had to speak
      about this ox-roasting fire. Also there was appointed a
      Suffragette meeting at Mr. Turner's house for eleven
      o'clock, at which past achievements and future plans would
      be discussed. She had barely time to wash her face, for it
      was unthinkable that Parker or the cook should see she had
      been crying, and get through her household duties, before
      it was time to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dried her eyes and went to the window, through which
      streamed the pale saffron-coloured October sunshine. All
      the stormy trouble of the night had passed, and the air
      sparkled with "the clear shining after rain." But the frost
      of a few nights before had blackened the autumn flowers,
      and the chill rain had beaten down the glory of her
      husband's chrysanthemums, so that the garden-beds looked
      withered and dishevelled, like those whose interest in life
      is finished, and who no longer care what appearance they
      present. The interest of others in them seemed to be
      finished also; it was not the gardener's day here, for he
      only came twice in the week, and Major Ames, who should
      have been assiduous in binding up the broken-stemmed,
      encouraging the invalids, and clearing away the havoc
      wrought by the storm, had left the house. Perhaps he had
      gone to the club, perhaps even now he was trying to make
      light of it all. She could almost hear him say, "Women get
      queer notions into their heads, and the notions run away
      with them, bless them. You'll take a glass of sherry with
      me, General, won't you? Are you by any chance going to Sir
      James' shoot next week? I'm shooting there one day." Or was
      he talking it over somewhere else, perhaps not making light
      of it? She did not know; all she knew was that she was
      alone, and wanted somebody who understood, even if he
      disagreed. It did not seem to matter that Lyndhurst utterly
      disagreed with her, what mattered was that he had
      misunderstood her motives so entirely, that the monstrous
      implication that she had been intoxicated seemed to him an
      excuse. And he was not sorry. What could she do since he
      was not sorry? It was as difficult to answer that as it was
      easy to know what to do the moment he was sorry. Indeed,
      then it would be unnecessary to do anything; the
      reconciliation would be automatic, and would bring with it
      something she yearned after, an opportunity of making him
      see that she cared, that the woman in her reached out
      towards him, in some different fashion now from that in
      which she had tried to recapture the semblance of youth and
      his awakened admiration. To-day, she looked back on that
      episode shamefacedly. She had taken so much trouble with so
      paltry a purpose. And yet that innocent and natural
      coquetry was not quite dead in her; no woman's heart need
      be so old that it no longer cares whether she is pleasing
      in her husband's eyes. Only to-day, it seemed to Mrs. Ames
      that her pains had been as disproportionate to her purpose
      as they had been to its result; now she longed to take
      pains for a purpose that was somewhat deeper than that for
      which she softened her wrinkles and refreshed the colour of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the window and the empty garden, wishing
      that the rain would be renewed, so that there would be an
      excuse for her to go to Mr. Turner's in a shut cab. As it
      was, there was no such excuse, and she felt that it would
      require an effort to walk past the club window, and to
      traverse the length of the High Street. Female Riseborough,
      on this warm sunny morning, she knew would be there in
      force, popping in and out of shops, and holding little
      conversations on the pavement. There would be but one topic
      to-day, and for many days yet; it would be long before the
      autumn novelty lost anything of its freshness. She wondered
      how her appearance in the town would be greeted; would
      people smile and turn aside as she approached, and whisper
      or giggle after she had gone by? What of the Mayor who,
      like an honest tradesman, was often to be seen at the door
      of his shop, or looking at the "dressing" of his windows? A
      policeman always stood at the bottom of the street,
      controlling the cross-traffic from St. Barnabas Road. Would
      he be that one who had helped to further her movements last
      night? . . . She almost felt she ought to thank him. . . .
      And then quite suddenly her pluck returned again, or it was
      that she realized that she did not, comparatively speaking,
      care two straws for any individual comment or by-play that
      might take place in the High Street, or for its accumulated
      weight. There were other things to care about. For them she
      cared immensely.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The High Street proved to be paved with incident. Turning
      quickly round the corner, she nearly ran into Bill, the
      policeman, off duty at this hour, and obviously giving a
      humorous recital of some sort to a small amused circle
      outside the public-house. It was abruptly discontinued when
      she appeared, and she felt that the interest that his
      audience developed in the sunny October sky, which they
      contemplated with faint grins, would be succeeded by
      stifled laughter after she had passed. A few paces further
      on, controlling the traffic of market-day, was her other
      policeman Bill, who smiled in a pleasant and familiar
      manner to her, as if there was some capital joke private to
      them. Twenty yards further along the street was standing
      the Mayor, contemplating his shop-window; he saw her, and
      urgent business appeared to demand his presence inside.
      After that there came General Fortescue tottering to the
      club; he crossed the street to meet her, and took off his
      hat and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! Mrs. Ames," he said, "I never enjoyed a meeting
      so much, and my wife's wild that she didn't go. What a
      lark! Made me feel quite young again. I wanted to shout
      too, and tell them to give the ladies a vote. Monstrously
      amusing! Just going to the club to have a chat about it
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went on his way, with his fat old body shaking with
      laughter. Then, feeling rather ill from this encounter, she
      heard rapid steps in pursuit of her, and Mrs. Altham joined
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. Ames," she said. "I could die of vexation that I
      was not there. Is it really true that you threw a glass of
      water at Mr. Chilcot and hit the policeman? Fancy, that it
      should have been such a terribly wet night, and Henry and I
      just sat at home, never thinking that five minutes in a cab
      would make such a difference. We sat and played patience; I
      should have been most impatient if I had known. And what is
      to happen next? It was so stupid of me not to join your
      league; I wonder if it is too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was quite dreadful; Mrs. Ames had been prepared for
      her husband's anger, and for pride and aversion from people
      like Mrs. Altham. What was totally unexpected and unwelcome
      was that she was supposed to have scored a sort of popular
      success, that Riseborough considered the dreadful fiasco of
      last night as an achievement, something not only to talk
      about, but a kind of new game, more exciting than croquet
      or criticism. She had begun by thinking of the Suffragette
      movement as an autumn novelty, but leanness came very near
      her soul when she found that it now appeared to others as
      she had first thought of it herself. She had travelled
      since then; she had seen the <i>hinterland</i> of it; the
      idea that rose up behind it, austere and beautiful and
      wise. All that these others saw was just the hysterical
      jungle that bounded the coast. To her this morning, after
      her experience of it, the hysterical jungle seemed--an
      hysterical jungle. If it was only by that route that the
      heights could be attained, then that route must be
      followed. She was willing to try it again. But was there
      not somewhere and somehow a better road?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not necessary to be particularly cordial to Mrs.
      Altham, and she held out no certain prospect of an
      immediate repetition of last night's scenes, nor of a
      desire for additional recruits. But further trials awaited
      her in this short walk. Dr. Evans, driving the
      high-stepping cob, wheeled round, and dismounted, throwing
      the reins to the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must just congratulate you," he said, "for Millie told
      me about last night. I've been telling her that if she had
      half your pluck, she would be the better for it. I hope you
      didn't catch cold; beastly night, wasn't it? Do let me know
      when it will come on again. I hate your principles, you
      know, but I love your practise. I shall come and shout,
      too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was perfectly awful. Nobody understood; they all
      sympathized with her, but cared not two straws for that
      which had prompted her to do these sensational things. . .
      . They liked the sensational things . . . it was fun to
      them. But it was no fun to those who believed in the
      principles which prompted them. They thought of her as a
      clown at a pantomime; they wanted to see Dan Leno. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She was some minutes late when she reached Mr. Turner's
      house, depressed and not encouraged by this uncomprehending
      applause that took as an excellent joke all the
      manifestations which had been directed by so serious a
      purpose. What to her was tragic and necessary, was to them
      a farce of entertaining quality. But now she would meet her
      coreligionists again, those who knew, those whose
      convictions, of the same quality as hers, were of such
      weight as to make her feel that even her quarrel with
      Lyndhurst was light in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jovial Turner family, father, mother, daughter, were in
      the drawing-room, and they hailed her as a heroine. If it
      had not been for her, there would have been no "scene" at
      all. Did the policemen hurt? Mr. Turner had got a small
      bruise on his knee, but it was quite doubtful whether he
      got it when he was taken out. Mrs. Turner had lost a small
      pearl ornament, but she was not sure whether she had put it
      on before going to the meeting. Miss Turner had a cold
      to-day, but it was certain that she had felt it coming on
      before they were all put out into the rain. None of them
      had seen the end; it was supposed that Mrs. Ames had thrown
      a glass of water at a policeman, and had hit Mr. Chilcot.
      They were all quite ready for Sir James' next meeting; or
      would he be a coward, and cause scrutiny to be held on
      those who desired admittance?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brooks arrived; she had not been turned out last
      night, but she had caught cold, and did not think that much
      had been achieved. Mr. Chilcot had made his speech,
      apparently a very clever one, about Tariff Reform, and Sir
      James had followed, without interruption, telling the half
      empty but sympathetic benches about the House of Lords.
      There had been no allusion made to the disturbance, or to
      the motives that prompted it. Also she had lost her
      Suffragette rosette. It must have been torn off her, though
      she did not feel it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Currie brought more life into the proceedings. She
      could get four porters to come to the next meeting, and
      could make another banner, as well as ensuring the proper
      unfurling of the first, which had stuck so unaccountably.
      It had waved quite properly when she had tried it an hour
      before, and it had waved quite properly (for it had been
      returned to her after she had been ejected) when she tried
      it again an hour later at home. Two banners expanding
      properly would be a vastly different affair from one that
      did not expand at all. Her husband had laughed fit to do
      himself a damage over her account of the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen more only of the league made an appearance, for
      clearly there was a reaction and a cooling after last
      night's conflagration, but all paid their meed of
      appreciation to Mrs. Ames. Their little rockets had but
      fizzed and spluttered until she "showed them the way," as
      Mrs. Currie expressed it. But to them even it was the
      ritual, so to speak, the disturbance, the shouting, the
      sense of doing something, rather than the belief that lay
      behind the ritual, which stirred their imaginations. Could
      the cause be better served by the endurance of an hour's
      solitary toothache, than by waving banners in the town
      hall, and being humanely ejected by benevolent policemen,
      there would have been less eagerness to suffer. And Mrs.
      Ames would so willingly have passed many hours of physical
      pain rather than suffer the heartache which troubled her
      this morning. And nobody seemed to understand; Mrs. Currie
      with her four porters and two banners, Mrs. Brooks with her
      cold in the head and odour of eucalyptus, the cheerful
      Turners who thought it would be such a good idea to throw
      squibs on to the platform, were all as far from the point
      as General Fortescue, chatting at the club, or even as
      Lyndhurst with the high-chipped bacon and the slammed front
      door. It was a game to them, as it had originally presented
      itself to her, an autumn novelty for, say, Thursday
      afternoon from five till seven. If only the opposite
      effects had been produced; if they all had taken it as
      poignantly as Lyndhurst, and he as cheerily as they!
    </p>
    <p>
      He, meantime, after slamming the front door, had stormed up
      St. Barnabas Road, in so sincere a passion that he had
      nearly reached the club before he remembered that he had
      hardly touched his breakfast or glanced at the paper. So,
      as there was no sense in starving himself (the starvation
      consisting in only having half his breakfast), he turned in
      at those hospitable doors, and ordered himself an omelette.
      Never in his life had he been so angry, never in the
      amazing chronicle of matrimony, so it seemed to him, had a
      man received such provocation from his wife. She had
      insulted the guests who had dined with her, she made a
      public and stupendous ass of herself, and when, next
      morning, he, after making such expostulations as he was
      morally bound to make, had been so nobly magnanimous as to
      assure her that he would patch it all up for her, and live
      it down with her, he had been told that it was for him to
      apologize! No wonder he had sworn; Moses would have sworn;
      it would have been absolutely wrong of him not to swear.
      There were situations in which it was cowardly for a man
      not to say what he thought. Even now, as he waited for his
      omelette, he emitted little squeaks and explosive
      exclamations, almost incredulous of his wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate his omelette, which seemed but to add fuel to his
      rage, and went into the smoking-room, where, over a club
      cigar, for he had actually forgotten to bring his own case
      with him, he turned to the consideration of practical
      details. It was not clear how to re-enter his house again.
      He had gone out with a bang that made the windows rattle,
      but it was hardly possible to go on banging the door each
      time he went in and out, for no joinery would stand these
      reiterated shocks. And what was to be done, even if he
      could devise an effective re-entry? Unless Amy put herself
      into his hands, and unreservedly took back all that she had
      said, it was impossible for him to speak to her. Somehow he
      felt that there were few things less likely to happen than
      this. Certainly it would be no good to resume storming
      operations, for he had no guns greater than those he had
      already fired, and if they were not of sufficient calibre,
      he must just beleaguer her with silence--dignified,
      displeased silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and saw that Mr. Altham was regarding him
      through the glass door; upon which Mr. Altham rapidly
      withdrew. Not long afterwards young Morton occupied and
      retired from the same observatory. A moment's reflection
      enabled Major Ames to construe this singular behaviour.
      They had heard of his wife's conduct, and were gluttonously
      feeding on so unusual a spectacle as himself in the club at
      this hour, and reconstructing in their monkey-minds his
      domestic disturbances. They would probably ascertain that
      he had breakfasted here. It was all exceedingly unpleasant;
      there was no sympathy in their covert glances, only
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who is not a brute, and Major Ames was not that,
      enjoys a quarrel with his wife, and no one who is not
      utterly self-centred, and he was not quite that either,
      fails to desire sympathy when such a quarrel has occurred.
      He wanted sympathy now; he wanted to pour out into friendly
      ears the tale of Amy's misdeeds, of his own magnanimity, to
      hear his own estimation of his conduct confirmed, fairly
      confirmed, by a woman who would see the woman's point of
      view as well as his. The smoking-room with these peeping
      Toms was untenable, but he thought he knew where he could
      get sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Millie was in and would see him; from habit, as he crossed
      the hall he looked to the peg where Dr. Evans hung his hat
      and coat, and, seeing they were not there, inferred that
      the doctor was out. That suited him; he wanted to confide
      and be sympathized with, and felt that Evans' breezy
      optimism and out-of-door habit of mind would not supply the
      kind of comfort he felt in need of. He wanted to be told he
      was a martyr and a very fine fellow, and that Amy was
      unworthy of him. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie was in the green, cool drawing-room, where they had
      sat one day after lunch. She rose as he entered and came
      towards him with a tremulous smile on her lips, and both
      hands outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lyndhurst," she said. "I am so glad you have come.
      Sit down. I think if you had not come I should have
      telephoned to ask if you would not see me. I should have
      suggested our taking a little walk, perhaps, for I do not
      think I could have risked seeing Cousin Amy. I know how you
      feel, oh, so well. It was abominable, disgraceful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly he had come to the right place. Millie understood
      him: he had guessed she would. She sat down close beside
      him, and for a moment held her hand over her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I have been so angry this morning," she said; "and it
      has given me a headache. Wilfred laughed about it all; he
      said also that what Amy did showed a tremendous lot of
      pluck. It was utterly heartless. I knew how you must be
      suffering, and I was so angry with him. He did not
      understand. Oh no, my headache is nothing; it will soon be
      gone--now."
    </p>
    <p>
      She faintly emphasized the last word, stroked it, so to
      speak, as if calling attention to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm broken-hearted about it," said Major Ames, which
      sounded better than to say, "I'm in a purple rage about
      it." "I'm broken-hearted. She's disgraced herself and me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; a woman can't do that sort of thing without the world
      believing that her husband knew about it. And that's not
      all. Upon my word I'm not sure whether what she did this
      morning isn't worse than what you saw last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she said, "if it doesn't hurt you too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided it did not hurt him too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I came down this morning," he said, "willing and
      eager to make the best of a bad job. So were we all: James
      Westbourne last night was just as generous, and asked the
      reporters to say nothing about it, and invited me to a
      day's shooting next week. Very decent of him. As I say, I
      came down this morning, willing to make it as easy as I
      could. Of course, I knew I had to give Amy a good talking
      to: I should utterly have failed in my duty to her as a
      husband if I did not do that. I gave her a blowing-up,
      though not half of what she deserved, but a blowing up.
      Even then, when I had said my say I told her we would live
      it down together, which was sufficiently generous, I think.
      But, for her good, I told her that James Westbourne said he
      saw she was unwell, and that when a man says that he means
      that she is drunk. Perhaps Westbourne didn't mean that, but
      that's what it sounded like. And would you believe it, just
      because I hadn't knocked him down and stamped on his face,
      she tells me I ought to apologize to her for letting such a
      suggestion pass. Well, I flared up at that: what man of
      spirit wouldn't have flared up? I left the house at once,
      and went and finished my breakfast at the club. I should
      have choked--upon my word, I should have choked if I had
      stopped there, or got an apoplexy. As it is, I feel
      devilish unwell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie got up, and stood for a moment in silence, looking
      out of the window, white and willowy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can never forgive Cousin Amy," she said at length.
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is hard," said Major Ames. "And after all these
      years! It isn't exactly the return one might expect,
      perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is infamous," said Millie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and sat down by him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. If she apologizes, I shall forgive her, and
      I shall try to forget. But I didn't think it of her. And if
      she doesn't apologize--I don't know. I can't be expected to
      eat my words: that would be countenancing what she has
      done. I couldn't do it: it would not be sincere. I'm
      straight, I hope: if I say a thing it may be taken for
      granted that I mean it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with her chin raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are wonderful," she said, "to be able even to
      think of forgiving her. If I had behaved like that, I
      should not expect Wilfred to forgive me. But then you are
      so big, so big. She does not understand you: she can't
      understand one thing about you. She doesn't know--oh, how
      blind some women are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was little wonder that by this time Major Ames was
      beginning to feel an extraordinarily fine fellow, nor was
      it more wonderful that he basked in the warm sense of being
      understood. But from the first Millie had understood him.
      He felt that particularly now, at this moment, when Amy had
      so hideously flouted and wronged him. All through this last
      summer, the situation of to-day had been foreshadowed; it
      had always been in this house rather than in his own that
      he had been welcomed and appreciated. He had been the
      architect and adviser in the Shakespeare ball, while at
      home Amy dealt out her absurd printed menu-cards without
      consulting him. And the garden which he loved--who had so
      often said, "These sweet flowers, are they really for me?"
      Who, on the other hand, had so often said, "The sweet-peas
      are not doing very well, are they?" And then he looked at
      Millie's soft, youthful face, her eyes, that sought his in
      timid, sensitive appeal, her dim golden hair, her mouth,
      childish and mysterious. For contrast there was the small,
      strong, toad's face, the rather beady eyes, the hair--grey
      or brown, which was it? Also, Millie understood; she saw
      him as he was--generous, perhaps, to a fault, but big, big,
      as she had so properly said. She always made him feel so
      comfortable, so contented with himself. That was the true
      substance of a woman's mission, to make her husband happy,
      to make him devoted to her, instead of raising hell in the
      town hall, and insisting on apologies afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've cheered me up, Millie," he said; "you've made me
      feel that I've got a friend, after all, a friend who feels
      with me. I'm grateful; I'm--I'm more than grateful. I'm a
      tough old fellow, but I've got a heart still, I believe.
      What's to happen to us all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was emotion, real and genuine emotion, that made Millie
      clever at that moment. Her mind was of no high order; she
      might, if she thought about a thing, be trusted to exhibit
      nothing more subtle than a fair grasp of the obvious. But
      now she did not think: she was prompted by an instinct that
      utterly transcended any achievement of which her brain was
      capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back to your house," she said, "and be ready for Cousin
      Amy to say she is sorry. Very likely she is waiting for you
      there now. Oh, Lyndhurst--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up at once: those few words made him feel completely
      noble; they made her feel noble likewise. The atmosphere of
      nobility was almost suffocating. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," he said; "you are always all that is right
      and good and delicious? Ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no question about the cousinly relations between
      them. So natural and spontaneous a caress needed no
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The house was apparently empty when he got back, but he
      made sufficiently noisy an entry to advise the
      drawing-room, in any case, that he was returned, and
      personally ready, since he did not enter "full of wrath,"
      like Hyperion, to accept apologies. Eventually he went in
      there, as if to look for a paper, in case of its being
      occupied, and, with the same pretext, strolled into his
      wife's sitting-room. Then, still casually, he went into his
      dressing-room, where he had slept last night, and satisfied
      himself that she was not in her bedroom. Her penitence,
      therefore, which would naturally be manifested by her
      waiting, dim-eyed, for his return, had not been of any
      peremptory quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out into the garden, and surveyed the damage of
      last night's rain. There was no need to punish the plants
      because Amy had been guilty of behaviour which her own
      cousin said was infamous: he also wanted something to
      employ himself with till lunch-time. As his hands worked
      mechanically, tying up some clumps of chrysanthemums which
      had a few days more of flame in their golden hearts,
      removing a dbris of dead leaves and fallen twigs, his mind
      was busy also, working not mechanically but eagerly and
      excitedly. How different was the sympathy with which he was
      welcomed and comforted by Millie from the misunderstandings
      and quarrels which made him feel that he had wasted his
      years with one who was utterly unappreciative of him. Yet,
      if Amy was sorry, he was ready to do his best. But he
      wondered whether he wanted her to be sorry or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past one the bell for lunch sounded, and, going
      into the drawing-room, he found that she had returned and
      was writing a note at her table. She did not look up, but
      said to him, just as if nothing had happened--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you go in and begin, Lyndhurst? I want to finish my
      note."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, but passed into the dining-room. In a
      little while she joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There seems to have been a good deal of rain in the
      night," she said. "I am afraid your flowers have suffered."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this did not look like penitence, and he had no
      reply for her. In some strange way this seemed to him the
      dignified and proper course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Ames spoke for the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, Lyndhurst, if we are not going to talk," she
      said, "I shall see what news there is. Parker, please fetch
      me the morning paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he hated her.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a name="c13" id="c13">CHAPTER XIII</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Major Ames was walking back home in the
      middle of the afternoon, returning from the house in which
      he had lately spent so considerable a portion of his time.
      But this was the last day on which he would go there, nor
      would he, except for this one time more, cross the
      threshold of his own house. The climax had come, and within
      an hour or two he and Millie were going to leave
      Riseborough together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that their decision had been made, it seemed to him
      that it had been inevitable from the first. Ever since the
      summer, when, from some mixture of genuine liking and false
      gallantry, he had allowed himself to drift into relations
      with her, the force that drew and held him had steadily
      increased in strength, and to-day it had proved itself
      irresistible. The determining factor no doubt had been his
      quarrel with his wife; that gave the impulse that had been
      still lacking, the final push which upset the equilibrium
      of that which was tottering and ready to fall over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene this afternoon had been both short and quiet, as
      such scenes are. Dr. Evans had been called up to town on
      business yesterday morning, returning possibly this evening
      but more probably to-morrow, and they had lunched alone.
      Afterwards Major Ames had again spoken of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The situation is intolerable," he had said. "I can't stand
      it. If it wasn't for you, Millie, I should go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not very happy, either," she said. "If it wasn't for
      you, I don't think I could stand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it was already inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too strong for us," she said. "We can't help it. I
      will face anything with you. We will go right away,
      Lyndhurst, and live, instead of being starved like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took both his hands in hers, completely carried away
      for the first time in her life by something outside
      herself. Treacherous and mean as was that course on which
      she was determined, she was, perhaps, a finer woman at this
      moment of supreme disloyalty than in all the years of her
      blameless married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never loved before, Lyndhurst," she said quietly,
      "nor have I ever known what it meant. Now I can't consider
      anything else; it doesn't matter what happens to Wilfred
      and Elsie. Nothing matters except you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This time it was not he who kissed her; it was she who
      pressed her mouth to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but little to settle, their plans were perfectly
      simple and ruthless. They would cross over to Boulogne that
      night, and, as soon as the law set them free, marry each
      other. A train to Folkestone left Riseborough in a little
      over an hour's time, running in connection with the boat.
      They could easily catch it. But it was wiser not to go to
      the station together: they would meet there.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked home through the gleaming October afternoon,
      Major Ames was conscious neither of struggle nor regret.
      The power which Millie had had over him all these months,
      so that it was she always who really took the lead, and
      urged him one step forward and then another, gripped him
      and led him on here to the last step of all. He still
      obeyed and followed that slender, fragile woman who so soon
      would be his; it was as necessary to do her bidding here as
      it had been to kiss her, when first, under the
      mulberry-tree, she had put up her face towards his. These
      last days seemed to have killed all sense of loyalty and
      manhood within him; he gave no thought at all to his wife,
      and thought of Harry only as Amy's son. Besides, he was not
      responsible: man though he was, he was completely in the
      hands of this woman. All his life he had had no real
      principles to direct him, he had lived a decent life only
      because no temptation to live otherwise had ever really
      come near him, and even now it was in no way the wickedness
      of what he purposed that at all dragged him back; it was
      mere timidity at taking an irrevocable step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy, he knew, was out: at breakfast she had announced to
      him that she did not expect to be in till dinner-time, and
      he had told her that he would be out for dinner. Such
      sentences dealing with household arrangements had been the
      sum of their discourse for the last days, and they were
      spoken not so much to each other as to the air, heard by,
      rather than addressed to any one in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the prospect of the life that should open for him,
      when once this irrevocable step had been taken, did not
      fill him with the resistless longing which, though it
      cannot excuse, at any rate accounts for the step itself.
      Millie, though throughout she had led him on until the
      climax was reached, had at least the authentic goad to
      drive her: life with him seemed to her to be real life: it
      was passionately that she desired it. But with him, apart
      from the force with which she dominated him, it was the
      escape from the very uncomfortable circumstances of home
      that chiefly attracted him. In a way, he loved her; he felt
      for her a warmth and a tenderness of stronger quality than
      he could remember having ever experienced before, and since
      it is not given to all men to love violently, it may be
      granted that he was feeling the utmost fire of which his
      nature was capable. But it was of sufficient ardour to burn
      up in his mind the rubbish of minor considerations and
      material exigencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabs were of infrequent occurrence at this far end of St.
      Barnabas Road, and meeting one by hazard just outside his
      house, he told the driver to wait. Then, letting himself
      in, he went straight up to his dressing-room. There was not
      time for him to pack his whole wardrobe, and a moderate
      portmanteau would be all he really needed. And here the
      trivialities began to wax huge and engrossing: though the
      afternoon was warm, it would no doubt be fresh, if not
      chilly on the boat, and it would certainly be advisable to
      take his thick overcoat, which at present had not left its
      summer quarters. Those were in a big cupboard in the
      passage outside, overlooking the garden, where it was
      packed away with prophylactic little balls of naphthaline.
      These had impregnated it somewhat powerfully, but it was
      better to be odorously than insufficiently clad. Passing
      the window he saw that the chrysanthemums had responded
      bravely to his comforting a few mornings ago: if there was
      no more frost they would be gay for another fortnight yet.
      Should he take a bouquet of them with him? He did not see
      why he should not have the enjoyment of them. Yet there was
      scarcely time to pick them: he must hurry on with the
      packing of his small portmanteau, which presented endless
      problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      A panama hat should certainly be included; also a pair of
      white tennis shoes, in which he saw himself promenading on
      the parade: a white flannel suit, though it was October,
      seemed to complete the costume. He need not cumber himself
      with a dress coat: a dinner jacket was all that would be
      necessary. She had told him she had six hundred a year of
      her own: he had another three. It was annoying that his
      sponge was rather ragged; he had meant to buy a new one
      this morning. Perhaps Parker could draw it together with a
      bit of thread. An untidy sponge always vexed him: it was
      unsoldierly and slovenly. "Show me a man's washhand-stand,"
      he had once said, "and I'll tell you about the owner." His
      own did not invite inspection, with its straggly sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for a moment all these trivialities stood away from
      him, and for an interval he saw where he stood and what he
      was doing--the vileness, the sordidness, the vulgarity of
      it. High principles, nobility of life were not subjects
      with which hitherto he had much concerned himself, and it
      would be useless to expect that they should come to his
      rescue now, but for this moment his kindliness, such as it
      was, his affection for his wife, such as it was, but above
      all the continuous, unbroken smug respectability of his
      days read him a formidable indictment. What could he plead
      against such an accusation? No irresistible or imperative
      necessity of soul that claimed Millie as his by right of
      love. He knew that his desire for her was not of that fiery
      order, for he could see, undazzled and unburned, the
      qualities which attracted him. He admired her frail beauty,
      the youth that still encompassed her, he fed with the
      finest appetite on the devotion and admiration which she
      brought him. He loved being the god and the hero of this
      attractive woman, and it was this, far more than the
      devotion he brought her, that dominated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respectability cried out against him and his foolishness.
      There would be no more strutting and swelling about the
      club among the mild and honourable men who frequented it,
      and looked up to him as an authority on India and
      gardening, nor any more of those pompous and satisfactory
      evenings when General Fortescue assured him that there was
      not such a good glass of port in Kent as that with which
      the Major supplied his guests. To be known as Major Ames,
      late of the Indian Army, had been to command respect; now,
      the less that he was known as Major Ames, late of
      Riseborough, the better would be the chance of being held
      in esteem. And to what sort of life would he condemn the
      woman, who for his sake was leaving a respectability no
      less solid than his own? To the companionship of such as
      herself, to the soiled doves of a French watering-place.
      That, of course, would be but a temporary habitation, but
      after that, what? Where was the society which would receive
      them, by which there would be any satisfaction in being
      received? Neither of them had the faintest touch of
      Bohemianism in their natures: both were of the school that
      is accustomed to silver teapots and life in houses with a
      garden behind. For a moment he hesitated as he folded back
      the sleeves of his dinner-jacket: then the tide of
      trivialities swept over him again, and he noticed that
      there was a spot of spilled wax on the cuff.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Among other engagements that Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Ames
      was occupied with the decoration of St. Barnabas' Church
      for the Sunday service next day, and she had gone there
      after lunch with an adornment of foliage tinted red by
      October, for she had not felt disposed to ask Lyndhurst if
      she might pick the remnant of his chrysanthemums. She, too,
      like him, felt the impossibility of the present situation,
      and, as she worked, she asked herself if it was in any way
      in her power to end this parody of domestic life. Every day
      she had made the attempt to begin the breaking of this
      ridiculous and most uncomfortable silence which lay between
      them, by the introduction of ordinary topics, hoping by
      degrees to build up again the breach that yawned between
      them, but at present she had got no sense of the slightest
      answering effort on his side. Psychically no less than
      conversationally he had nothing whatever to say to her. If
      in the common courtesies of daily life he had nothing for
      her, it seemed idle to hope to find further receptiveness
      if she opened discussion of their quarrel. Besides, a
      certain very natural pride blocked her way: he owed her an
      apology, and when she indicated that, he had sworn at her.
      It did not seem unreasonable (even when decorating a
      church) to expect the initiatory step to be taken by him.
      But what if he did not do so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames gave a little sigh, and her mouth and throat
      worked uncomfortably. The quarrel was so childish, yet it
      was serious, for it was not a light thing, whatever her
      provocation might have been, to pass days like these.
      Half-a-dozen times she went over the circumstances, and
      half-a-dozen times she felt that it was only just that he
      should make the advance to her, or at any rate behave with
      ordinary courtesy in answer to her ordinary civilities. It
      was true that the original dissension was due to her, but
      she believed with her whole heart in the cause for which
      she provoked it. All these last months she had felt her
      nature expand under the influence of this idea: she knew
      herself to be a better and a bigger woman than she had
      been. She believed in the rights of her sex, but had they
      not their duties too? It was nearly twenty-five years since
      she had voluntarily undertaken a certain duty. What if that
      came first, before any rights or privileges? What if that
      which she had undertaken then as a duty was in itself a
      right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even then, what could she do? In itself, she was very
      far from being ashamed of the part she had taken, yet was
      it possible to weigh this independently, without
      considering the points at which it conflicted with duties
      which certainly concerned her no less? She could not hope
      to convince her husband of the justice of the cause, nor of
      the expediency of promoting it in ways like these. For
      herself, she knew the justice of it, and saw no other
      expedient for promoting it. Those who had worked for the
      cause for years said that all else had been tried, that
      there remained only this violent crusading. But was not she
      personally, considering what her husband felt about it,
      debarred from taking part in the crusade? She had deeply
      offended and vexed him. Could anything but the stringency
      of moral law justify that? Nothing that he had done,
      nothing that he could do, short of the violation of the
      essential principles of married life, could absolve her
      from the accomplishment of one tittle of her duty towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, in spite of her perplexity and the difficulty
      of her decision, Mrs. Ames smiled at herself for the mental
      use of all these great words like duty and privilege, over
      so small an incident. For what had happened? She had been a
      militant Suffragette on one occasion only, and at breakfast
      next morning he had, in matters arising therefrom, allowed
      himself to swear at her. Yet it seemed to her that, with
      all the pettiness and insignificance of it, great laws were
      concerned. For the law of kindness is broken by the most
      trumpery exhibition of inconsiderateness, the law of
      generosity by the most minute word of spite or backbiting.
      Indeed, it is chiefly in little things, since most of us
      are not concerned with great matters, that these violations
      occur, and in cups of cold water that they are fulfilled.
      And for once Mrs. Ames did not finish her decoration with
      tidiness and precision, a fact clearly noted by Mrs. Altham
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a Suffragette meeting at four, but she was
      prepared to be late for that, or, if necessary, to fail in
      attendance altogether. In any case, she would call in at
      home on her way there, on the chance that her husband might
      be in. She made no definite plan: it was impossible to
      forecast her share in the interview. But she had determined
      to try to suffer long, to be kind . . . to keep the promise
      of twenty-five years ago. There was a cab drawn up at the
      entrance, and it vaguely occurred to her that Millie might
      be here, for she had not seen her for some days, and it was
      possible she might have called. Yet it was hardly likely
      that she would have waited, since the servants would have
      told her that she herself was not expected home till
      dinner-time. Or was Lyndhurst giving her tea? And Mrs. Ames
      grew suddenly alert again about matters to which she had
      scarcely given a thought during these last months.
    </p>
    <p>
      She let herself in, and went to the drawing-room: there was
      no one there, nor in the little room next it where they
      assembled before dinner on nights when they gave a party.
      But directly overhead she heard steps moving: that was in
      Lyndhurst's dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up there, knocked, and in answer to his assent
      went in. The portmanteau was nearly packed, he stood in
      shirt-sleeves by it. In his hand was his sponge-bag--he had
      anticipated the entry of Parker with the stitched sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked from the portmanteau to him, and back and back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going away, Lyndhurst?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a ghastly attempt to devise a reasonable answer,
      and thought he succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm going--going to your cousin's to shoot. I told
      you he had asked me. You objected to my going, but I'm
      going all the same. I should have left you a note. Back
      to-morrow night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she felt she knew all, as certainly as if he had told
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since when has Cousin James been giving shooting parties
      on Sunday?" she asked. "Please don't lie to me, Lyndhurst.
      It makes it much worse. You are not going to Cousin James,
      and--you are not going alone. Shall I tell you any more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not guessing: all the events of the last month, the
      Shakespeare ball, Harrogate, their own quarrel, and on the
      top this foolish lie about a shooting party made a series
      of data which proclaimed the conclusion. And the suddenness
      of the discovery, the magnitude of the issues involved, but
      served to steady her. There was an authentic valour in her
      nature; even as she had stood up to interrupt the political
      meeting, without so much as dreaming of shirking her part,
      so now her pause was not timorous, but rather the rallying
      of all her forces, that came eager and undismayed to her
      summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Lyndhurst did not want to be told any more: he
      did not, at any rate, ask for it. Just then Parker came in
      with the mended sponge. She gave it him, and he stood with
      sponge-bag in one hand, sponge in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I bring up tea, ma'am?" she said to Mrs. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, take it to the drawing-room now. And send the cab
      away. The Major won't want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lyndhurst crammed the sponge into its bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall want the cab, Parker," he said. "Don't send it
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames whisked round on Parker with amazing rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as I tell you, Parker," she said, "and be quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mere conflict of will that, for the next five
      seconds, silently raged between them, but as definite and
      as hard-hitting as any affair of the prize ring. And it was
      impossible that there should be any but the one end to it,
      for Mrs. Ames devoted her whole strength and will to it,
      while from the first her husband's heart was not in the
      battle. But she was fighting for her all, and not only her
      all, but his, and not only his, but Millie's. Three
      existences were at stake, and the ruin of two homes was
      being hazarded. And when he spoke, she knew she was
      winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go," he said. "She will be waiting at the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will wait to no purpose," said Mrs. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will be"--no word seemed adequate--"be furious," he
      said. "A man cannot treat a woman like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Any blow would do: he had no defence: she could strike him
      as she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elsie comes home next week," she said. "A pleasant
      home-coming. And Harry will have to leave Cambridge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I love her!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, my dear," she said. "Men don't ruin the women
      they love. Men, I mean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That stung; she meant that it should.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But men keep their word," he said. "Let me pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your word to me," said she, "and try to help poor
      Millie to keep hers to her husband. It is not a fine thing
      to steal a man's wife, Lyndhurst. It is much finer to be
      respectable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respectable!" he said. "And to what has respectability
      brought us? You and me, I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to disgrace, anyhow," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too late," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never quite too late, thank God," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames gave a little sigh. She knew she had won, and
      quite suddenly all her strength seemed to leave her. Her
      little trembling legs refused to uphold her, a curious
      buzzing was in her ears, and a crinkled mist swam before
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lyndhurst, I'm afraid I am going to make a goose of myself
      and faint," she said. "Just help me to my room, and get
      Parker--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She swayed and tottered, and he only just caught her before
      she fell. He laid her down on the floor and opened the door
      and window wide. There was a flask of brandy in his
      portmanteau, laid on the top, designed to be easily
      accessible in case of an inclement crossing of the Channel.
      He mixed a tablespoonful of this with a little water, and
      as she moved, and opened her eyes again, he knelt down on
      the floor by her, supporting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a sip of this, Amy," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear," she said. "I am better. So silly of
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another sip, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to make me drunk, Lyndhurst," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she smiled: it would be a pity to lose the opportunity
      for a humorous allusion to what at the time had been so far
      from humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really drunk, this time," she said. "And then you can tell
      Cousin James he was right."
    </p>
    <p>
      She let herself rest longer than was physically necessary
      in the encircling crook of his arm, and let herself keep
      her eyes closed, though, if she had been alone, she would
      most decidedly have opened them. But those first few
      minutes had somehow to be traversed, and she felt that
      silence bridged them over better than speech. It was
      appropriate, too, that his arm should be round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, I am better," she said at length. "Let me get up,
      Lyndhurst. Thank you for looking after me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She got on to her feet, but then sat down again in his
      easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite steady yet?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very nearly. I shall be quite ready to come downstairs and
      give you your tea by the time you have unpacked your little
      portmanteau."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not even look at him, but sat turned away from him
      and the little portmanteau. But she heard the rustle of
      paper, the opening and shutting of drawers, the sound of
      metallic articles of toilet being deposited on
      dressing-table and washing-stand. After that came the click
      of a hasp. Then she got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now let us have tea," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if Millie comes?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been determined that he should mention her name
      first. But when once he had mentioned it she was more than
      ready to discuss the questions that naturally arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean she may come back here to see what has happened
      to you?" she asked. "That is well thought of, dear. Let us
      see. But we will go downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought intently as they descended the staircase, and
      busied herself with tea-making before she got to her
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will ask for you," she said, "if she comes, and it
      would not be very wise for you to see her. On the other
      hand, she must be told what has happened. I will see her,
      then. It would be best that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Ames got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't have that," he said. "I can't have that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you have got to have it. You are in a dreadful
      mess. I, as your wife, am the only person who can get you
      out of it. I will do my best, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to tell Parker to tell Millie that you are at
      home if she asks for you, and to show her in here," she
      said. "There is no other way that I can see. I do not
      intend to have nothing more to do with her. At least I want
      to avoid that, if possible, for that is a weak way out of
      difficulties. I shall certainly have to see her some time,
      and there is no use in putting it off. I am afraid,
      Lyndhurst, that you had better finish your tea at once, or
      take it upstairs. Take another cup upstairs; you have had
      but one, and drink it in your dressing-room, in the
      comfortable chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an extraordinary wisdom in this minute attention
      to detail, and it was by this that she was able to rise to
      a big occasion. It was necessary that he should feel that
      her full intention was to forgive him, and make the best of
      the days that lay before them. She had no great words and
      noble sentiment with which to convey this impression, but,
      in a measure, she could show him her mind by minute
      arrangements for his comfort. But he lingered, irresolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have got to trust me," she said. "Do as I tell you, my
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not long to wait after he had gone upstairs. She
      heard the ring at the bell, and next moment Millie came
      into the room. Her face was flushed, her breathing hurried,
      her eyes alight with trouble, suspense, and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lyndhurst," she began. "I waited--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she saw Mrs. Ames, and turned confusedly about, as if
      to leave the room again. But Amy got up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sit down at once, Millie," she said. "We have got
      to talk. So let us make it as easy as we can for each
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie was holding her muff up to her face, and peered at
      her from above it, wild-eyed, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't you I want," she said. "Where is Lyndhurst? I--I
      had an appointment with him. He was late--we--we were going
      a drive together. What do you know, Cousin Amy?" she almost
      shrieked; "and where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Millie, as I tell you," said Mrs. Ames very
      quietly. "There is nothing to be frightened at. I know
      everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were going a drive," began Millie again, still looking
      wildly about. "He did not come, and I was frightened. I
      came to see where he was. I asked you if you knew--if you
      knew anything about him, did I not? Why do you say you know
      everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mrs. Ames saw that there was something here
      infinitely more worthy of pity than she had suspected.
      There was no question as to the agonized earnestness that
      underlay this futile, childish repetition of nonsense. And
      with that there came into her mind a greater measure of
      understanding with regard to her husband. It was not so
      wonderful that he had been unable to resist the face that
      had drawn him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us behave like sensible women, Millie," she said. "You
      have come down from the station. Lyndhurst was not there.
      Do you want me to tell you anything more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie wavered where she stood, then she stumbled into a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he given me up?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if you care to put it like that. It would be truer to
      say that he has saved you and himself. But he is not coming
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You made him?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I helped to make him," said Mrs. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie got up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see him," she said. "You don't understand,
      Cousin Amy. He has got to come. I don't care whether it is
      wicked or not. I love him. You don't understand him either.
      You don't know how splendid he is. He is unhappy at home;
      he has often told me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames took hold of the wretched woman by both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are raving, Millie," she said. "You must stop being
      hysterical. You hardly know whom you are talking to. If you
      do not pull yourself together, I shall send for your
      husband, and say you have been taken ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Millie gave a sudden gasp of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am not so stupid as you think!" she said. "Wilfred
      is away. Where is Lyndhurst?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames did not let go of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Millie," she said, "if you are not sensible at once, I
      will tell you what I shall do. I shall call Parker, and
      together we will put you into your cab, and you shall be
      driven straight home. I am perfectly serious. I hope you
      will not oblige me to do that. You will be much wiser to
      pull yourself together, and let us have a talk. But
      understand one thing quite clearly. You are not going to
      see Lyndhurst."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension of those wide, childish eyes slowly relaxed,
      and her head sank forward, and there came the terrible and
      blessed tears, in wild cataract and streaming storm. And
      Mrs. Ames, looking at her, felt all her righteousness
      relax; she had only pity for this poor destitute soul, who
      was blind to all else by force of that mysterious longing
      which, in itself, is so divine that, though it desires the
      disgraceful and the impossible, it cannot wholly make
      itself abominable, nor discrown itself of its royalty.
      Something of the truth of that, though no more than mere
      fragments and moulted feather, came to Mrs. Ames now, as
      she sat waiting till the tempest of tears should have
      abated. The royal eagle had passed over her; as sign of his
      passage there was this feather that had fallen, and she
      understood its significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the tears ceased and the sobs were still, and Millie
      raised her dim, swollen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better go home," she said. "I wonder if you would
      let me wash my face, Cousin Amy. I must be a perfect
      fright."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Millie," said she; "but there is no hurry. See,
      shall I send your cab back to your house? It has your
      luggage on it; yes? Then Parker shall go with it, and tell
      them to take it back to your room and unpack it, and put
      everything back in place. Afterwards, when we have talked a
      little, I will walk back with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the comfort of having little things attended to
      reached Millie, that and the sense that she was not quite
      alone. She was like a child that has been naughty and has
      been punished, and she did not much care whether she had
      been naughty or not. What she wanted primarily was to be
      comforted, to be assured that everybody was not going to be
      angry with her for ever. Then, returning, Mrs. Ames made
      her some fresh tea, and that comforted her too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't see how I can ever be happy again," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something childlike about this, as well as
      childish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Millie," said the other. "None of us three see that
      exactly. We shall all have to be very patient. Very patient
      and ordinary."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must tell you one thing," said Millie, "though I daresay
      that will make you hate me more. But it was my fault from
      the first. I led him on--I--I didn't let him kiss me, I
      made him kiss me. It was like that all through!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that Mrs. Ames was waiting for something more, and
      she knew exactly what it was. But it required a greater
      effort to speak of that than she could at once command. At
      last she raised her eyes to those of Mrs. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, never," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," she said baldly. "Now, as I said, we have got to
      be patient and ordinary. We have got, you and I, to begin
      again. You have your husband, so have I. Men are so easily
      pleased and made happy. It would be a shame if we failed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the helpless, puzzled look came over Millie's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't see how to begin," she said. "Tomorrow, for
      instance, what am I to do all to-morrow? I shall only be
      thinking of what might have happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames took up her soft, unresisting, unresponsive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, by all means, think what might have happened," she
      said. "Utter ruin, utter misery, and--and all your fault.
      You led him on, as you said. He didn't care as you did. He
      wouldn't have thought of going away with you, if he hadn't
      been so furious with me. Think of all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some straggler from that host of sobs shook Millie for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps Wilfred would take me away instead," she said. "I
      will ask him if he cannot. Do you think I should feel
      better if I went away for a fortnight, Cousin Amy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ames' twisted little smile played about her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said. "I think that is an excellent plan. I am
      quite sure you will feel better in a fortnight, if you can
      look forward like that, and want to be better. And now
      would you like to wash your face? After that, I will walk
      home with you."
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c14" id="c14">CHAPTER XIV</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was a brisk morning in November, and Mr. and Mrs.
      Altham, who breakfasted at half-past eight in the summer,
      and nine in the winter, were seated at breakfast, and Mr.
      Altham was thinking how excellent was the savour of grilled
      kidneys. But he was not sure if they were really wholesome,
      and he was playing an important match at golf this
      afternoon. Perhaps two kidneys approached the limits of
      wisdom. Besides, his wife was speaking of really absorbing
      things; he ought to be able to distract his mind from the
      kidneys he was proposing to deny himself, under the sting
      of so powerful a counter-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to think that Mrs. Ames isn't going to be a
      Suffragette any more!" she said. "I met Mrs. Turner when I
      took my walk just now, and she told me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A word of explanation is necessary. The fact was that
      Swedish exercises, and a short walk on an empty stomach,
      were producing wonderful results in Riseborough at the
      moment, especially among its female inhabitants. They now,
      instead of meeting in the High Street before lunch, to
      stand about on the pavement and exchange news, met there
      before breakfast, when on these brisk autumn mornings it
      was wiser not to stand about. They therefore skimmed
      rapidly up and down the street together, in short skirts
      and walking boots. Rain and sunny weather, in this first
      glow of enthusiasm, were alike to them, and they had their
      baths afterwards. These exercises gave a considerable
      appetite for breakfast, and produced a very pleasant and
      comfortable feeling of fatigue. But this fatigue was a
      legitimate, indeed, a desirable effect, for their systems
      naturally demanded repose after exertion, and an hour's
      rest after breakfast was recommended. Thus this getting up
      earlier did not really result in any actual saving of time,
      though it made everybody feel very busy, and they all went
      to bed a little earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham found he got on very nicely without these
      gymnastics, but then he played golf after lunch. It was no
      use playing tricks with your health if it was already
      excellent: you might as well poke about in the works of a
      punctual watch. He had already had a pretty sharp lesson on
      this score, over the consumption of sour milk. It had made
      him exceedingly unwell, and he had sliced his drive for a
      fortnight afterwards. Just now he weaned his mind from the
      thoughts of kidneys, and gave it in equitable halves to
      marmalade and his wife's conversation. To enjoy either,
      required silence on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She went to a meeting yesterday," said Mrs. Altham, "so
      Mrs. Turner told me, and said that though she had the
      success of the cause so deeply at heart as ever, she would
      not be able to take any active part in it. That is a very
      common form of sympathy. I suppose, from what one knows of
      Mrs. Ames, we might have expected something of the sort. Do
      you remember her foolish scheme of asking wives without
      husbands, and husbands without wives? I warned you at the
      time, Henry, not to take any notice of it, because I was
      sure it would come to nothing, and I think I may say I am
      justified. I don't know what <i>you</i> think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Altham, by a happy coincidence, had finished
      masticating his last piece of toast at this moment, and was
      at liberty to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think anything about it at present," said he. "I
      daresay you are quite right, but why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham gave a little shrill laugh. The sprightliness
      at breakfast produced by this early walk and the exercises
      was very marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare," she said, "that I had forgotten to tell you.
      Mrs. Ames wrote to ask us both to dine on Saturday. I had
      quite forgotten! There is something in the air before
      breakfast that makes one forgetful of trifles. It says so
      in the pamphlet. Worries and household cares vanish, and it
      becomes a joy to be alive. I don't think we have any
      engagement. Pray do not have a third cup of tea, Henry.
      Tannin combines the effects of stimulants and narcotics. A
      cup of hot water, now--you will never regret it. Let me
      see! Yes, dinner at the Ames' on Saturday, and she isn't a
      Suffragette any longer. As I said, one might have guessed.
      I daresay her husband gave her a good talking-to, after the
      night when she threw the water at the policeman. I should
      not wonder if there was madness in the family. I think I
      heard that Sir James' mother was very queer before she
      died!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She lived till ninety," remarked Mr. Altham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is often the case with deranged people," said Mrs.
      Altham. "Lunatics are notoriously long-lived. There is no
      strain on the brain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she wasn't any relation of Mrs. Ames," continued
      Henry. "Mrs. Ames is related to the Westbournes. She has no
      more to do with Sir James' mother than I have to do with
      yours. I will take tea, my dear, not hot water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to catch me up, Henry," said she, "and prove I am
      wrong somehow. I was only saying that very likely there is
      madness in Mrs. Ames' family, and I was going to add that I
      hoped it would not come out in her. But you must allow that
      she has been very flighty. You would have thought that an
      elderly woman like that could make up her mind once and for
      all about things, before she made an exhibition of herself.
      She thinks she is like some royal person who goes and opens
      a bazaar, and then has nothing more to do with it, but
      hurries away to Leeds or somewhere to unveil a memorial.
      She thinks it is sufficient for her to help at the
      beginning, and get all the advertisement, and then drop it
      all like cold potatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hot," said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hot or cold: that is just like her. She plays hot and
      cold. One day she is a Suffragette and the next day she
      isn't. As likely as not she will be a vegetarian on
      Saturday, and we shall be served with cabbages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Major Ames went over to Sir James' to shoot,--she wasn't
      asked," said Henry, reverting to a previous topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are!" exclaimed Mrs. Altham. "That will account
      for her abandoning this husband and wife theory. I am sure
      she did not like that, she being Sir James' relative and
      not being asked. But I never could quite understand what
      the relationship is, though I daresay Mrs. Ames can make it
      out. There are people who say they are cousins, because a
      grandmother's niece married the other grandmother's nephew.
      We can all be descendants of Queen Elizabeth or of Charles
      the Second at that rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be easier to be a descendant of Charles the
      Second than of Queen Elizabeth, my dear," remarked Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham pursed her lips up for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think we need enter into that," she said. "I was
      asking you if you wished to accept Mrs. Ames' invitation
      for Saturday. She says she expects Sir James and his wife,
      so perhaps we shall hear some more about this wonderful
      relationship, and Dr. Evans and his wife and one or two
      others. To my mind that looks rather as if the husband and
      wife plan was not quite what she expected it would be. And
      giving up all active part in the Suffragette movement, too!
      But I daresay she feels her age, though goodness only knows
      what it is. However, it is clearly going to be a grand
      party on Saturday, and the waiter from the Crown will be
      there to help Parker, going round and pouring a little foam
      into everybody's glass. I do not know where Major Ames gets
      his champagne from, but I never get anything but foam. But
      I am sure I do not wish to be unkind, and certainly poor
      Major Ames does not look well. I daresay he has worries we
      do not know of, and, of course, there is no reason why he
      should speak of them to us. The Evans', too! I never
      satisfied myself as to why they went away in October. They
      must have been away nearly three weeks, for it was only
      yesterday that I saw them driving down from the station,
      with so much luggage on the top of the cab I wonder it did
      not fall over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't have been yesterday, my dear," said Mr. Altham,
      "because you spoke of it to me two days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it your own way, Henry," said she. "I am
      quite willing that you should think it was a twelvemonth
      ago, if you choose. But I suppose you will not dispute that
      they went away in October, which is a very odd time to take
      for a holiday. Of course, Mrs. Evans stopped here all
      August, or so she says, and she might answer that she
      wanted a little change of air. But for my part, I think
      there must have been something more, though, as I say, I
      cannot guess what it is. Luckily, it is no concern of mine,
      and I need not worry my head about it. But I have always
      thought Mrs. Evans looked far from strong, and it seems odd
      that a doctor's wife should not be more robust, when she
      has all his laboratory to choose from."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry lit his cigarette, and strolled to the window. The
      lawn was still white with the unmelted hoar-frost, and the
      gardener was busy in the beds, putting things tidy for the
      winter. This consisted in plucking up anything of vegetable
      origin and carrying it off in a wheelbarrow. Thus the beds
      were ready to receive the first bedded-out plants next May.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember, my dear," said Henry, "that you once thought
      that there had been some--some understanding between Mrs.
      Evans and Major Ames, and some misunderstanding between
      Major Ames and Dr. Evans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham brought her eyebrows together and put her
      finger on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seem to remember some ridiculous story of yours, Henry,
      about a bunch of chrysanthemums in the road outside Dr.
      Evans' house, how you had seen Major Ames take them in, and
      there they were afterwards in the road. I seem to remember
      your being so much excited about it that I made a point of
      going round to Mrs. Ames' next day with--with a book. I
      think that at the time--correct me if I am wrong--I
      convinced you that there was nothing whatever in it. . . .
      Or have you seen or heard anything since that makes you
      think differently?" she added rather more briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, nothing whatever," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad, very glad," she said. "At any rate, we know in
      Riseborough that we are safe from that sort of thing. I
      declare when I went to London last week, I hardly slept
      with thinking of the dreadful things that might be going on
      round me. Dear me, it is nearly ten o'clock. I do not know
      whether the hours or the days go quickest! It is always
      half-an-hour later than I expect it to be, and here we are
      in November already. I shall rest for an hour, Henry, and I
      will write to Mrs. Ames before lunch saying we shall be
      delighted to come on Saturday. November the twelfth, too!
      Nearly half November will be gone by then, and that leaves
      us but six weeks to Christmas, and it will be as much as we
      shall be able to manage to get through all that has to be
      done before that. But with these Swedish exercises, I
      declare I feel younger every day, and more able to cope
      with everything. You should take to them, Henry; by eleven
      o'clock they are finished and you have had your rest. With
      a little management you would find time for everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sat over the dining-room fire, considering this. As
      has been mentioned, he did not want to make any change in
      his excellent health, but, on the other hand, a little rest
      after breakfast would be pleasant, and when that was over
      it would be almost time to go to the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was impossible to settle a question like that
      offhand. After he had read the paper he would think about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Altham came hurrying back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henry, you would never guess what I have seen!" she said.
      "I glanced out of the window in the hall on the way to my
      room, and there was Mrs. Ames wobbling about the road on a
      bicycle. Major Ames was holding it upright with both hands,
      and it looked to be as much as he could manage. Yet she has
      no time for Suffragettes! I should be sorry if I thought I
      should ever make such a hollow excuse as that. And at her
      age, too! I had no time to call you, but I dare say she
      will be back soon if you care to watch. The window-seat in
      the hall is quite comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry took his paper there.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
