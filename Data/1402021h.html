  <h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">I. &mdash; WITHOUT REGRETS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE day before the disaster, Iris Carr had her
  first premonition of danger. She was used to the protection of a
  crowd, whom&mdash;with unconscious flattery&mdash;she called "her
  friends." An attractive orphan of independent means, she had been
  surrounded always with clumps of people. They thought for
  her&mdash;or rather, she accepted their opinions, and they
  shouted for her&mdash;since her voice was rather too low in
  register, for mass social intercourse.</p>

  <p>Their constant presence tended to create the illusion that she
  moved in a large circle, in spite of the fact that the same faces
  recurred with seasonal regularity. They also made her pleasantly
  aware of popularity. Her photograph appeared in the pictorial
  papers through the medium of a photographer's offer of publicity,
  after the Press announcement of her engagement to one of the
  crowd.</p>

  <p>This was Fame.</p>

  <p>Then, shortly afterwards, her engagement was broken, by mutual
  consent&mdash;which was a lawful occasion for the reproduction of
  another portrait. More Fame. And her mother, who died at her
  birth, might have wept or smiled at these pitiful flickers of
  human vanity, arising, like bubbles of marsh-gas, on the darkness
  below.</p>

  <p>When she experienced her first threat of insecurity, Iris was
  feeling especially well and happy after an unconventional health-
  holiday. With the triumph of near-pioneers, the crowd had swooped
  down on a beautiful village of picturesque squalor, tucked away
  in a remote corner of Europe, and taken possession of it by the
  act of scrawling their names in the visitors' book.</p>

  <p>For nearly a month they had invaded the only hotel, to the
  delighted demoralisation of the innkeeper and his staff. They
  scrambled up mountains, swam in the lake, and sunbathed on every
  available slope. When they were indoors, they filled the bar,
  shouted against the wireless, and tipped for each trifling
  service. The proprietor beamed at them over his choked cash-
  register, and the smiling waiters gave them preferential
  treatment, to the legitimate annoyance of the other English
  guests.</p>

  <p>To these six persons, Iris appeared just one of her crowd, and
  a typical semi-Society girl&mdash;vain, selfish, and useless.
  Naturally, they had no knowledge of redeeming points&mdash;a
  generosity which made her accept the bill, as a matter of course,
  when she lunched with her "friends," and a real compassion for
  such cases of hardship which were clamped down under her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>But while she was only vaguely conscious of fugitive moments
  of discontent and self-contempt, she was aware of a fastidious
  streak, which kept her aloof from any tendency to saturnalia. On
  this holiday she heard Pan's pipes, but had no experience of the
  kick of his hairy hind quarters.</p>

  <p>Soon the slack convention of the crowd had been relaxed. They
  grew brown, they drank and were merry, while matrimonial
  boundaries became pleasantly blurred. Surrounded by a mixed bag
  of vague married couples, it was a sharp shock to Iris when one
  of the women&mdash;Olga&mdash;suddenly developed a belated sense
  of property, and accused her of stealing a husband.</p>

  <p>Besides the unpleasantness of the scene, her sense of justice
  was outraged. She had merely tolerated a neglected male, who
  seemed a spare part in the dislocated domestic machine. It was
  not her fault that he had lost his head.</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, at this crisis, she failed to notice
  any signs of real loyalty among her friends, who had plainly
  enjoyed the excitement. Therefore, to ease the tension, she
  decided not to travel back to England with the party, but to stay
  on for two days longer, alone.</p>

  <p>She was still feeling sore, on the following day, when she
  accompanied the crowd to the little primitive railway station.
  They had already reacted to the prospect of a return to
  civilisation. They wore fashionable clothes again, and were
  roughly sorted into legitimate couples, as a natural sequence to
  the identification of suitcases and reservations.</p>

  <p>The train was going to Trieste, which was definitely on the
  map. It was packed with tourists, who were also going back to
  pavements and lamp-posts. Forgetful of hillside and starlight,
  the crowd responded to the general noise and bustle. It seemed to
  recapture its old loyalty as it clustered round Iris.</p>

  <p>"Sure you won't be bored, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Change your mind and hop on."</p>

  <p>"You've simply <i>got</i> to come."</p>

  <p>As the whistle was blown, they tried to pull her into their
  carriage&mdash;just as she was, in shorts and nailed boots, and
  with a brown glaze of sunburn on her unpowdered face. She fought
  like a boxing-kangaroo to break free, and only succeeded in
  jumping down as the platform was beginning to slide past the
  window.</p>

  <p>Laughing and panting from the struggle, she stood and waved
  after the receding train, until it disappeared round the bend of
  the gorge.</p>

  <p>She felt almost guilty as she realised her relief at parting
  from her friends. But, although the holiday had been a success,
  she had drawn her pleasure chiefly from primeval
  sources&mdash;sun, water, and mountain-breeze. Steeped in Nature,
  she had vaguely resented the human intrusion.</p>

  <p>They had all been together too closely and too intimately. At
  times, she had been conscious of jarring notes&mdash;a woman's
  high thin laugh&mdash;the tubby outline of a man's body, poised
  to dive&mdash;a continual flippant appeal to "My God."</p>

  <p>It was true that while she had grown critical of her friends
  she had floated with the current. Like the others, she had raved
  of marvellous scenery, while she accepted it as a matter of
  course. It was a natural sequence that, when one travelled off
  the map, the landscape improved automatically as the standard of
  sanitation lapsed.</p>

  <p>At last she was alone with the mountains and the silence.
  Below her lay a grass-green lake, sparkling with diamond
  reflections of the sun. The snowy peaks of distant ranges were
  silhouetted against a cornflower-blue sky. On a hill rose the
  dark pile of an ancient castle, with its five turrets pointing
  upwards, like the outspread fingers of a sinister hand.</p>

  <p>Everywhere was a riot of colour. The station garden foamed
  with exotic flowers&mdash;flame and yellow&mdash;rising from
  spiked foliage. Higher up the slope, the small wooden hotel was
  painted ochre and crimson lake. Against the green wall of the
  gorge rose the last coil of smoke, like floating white
  feathers.</p>

  <p>When it had faded away, Iris felt that the last link had been
  severed between her and the crowd. Blowing a derisive kiss, she
  turned away and clattered down the steep stony path. When she
  reached the glacier-fed river, she lingered on the bridge, to
  feel the iced air which arose from the greenish-white boil.</p>

  <p>As she thought of yesterday's scene, she vowed that she never
  wanted to see the crowd again. They were connected with an
  episode which violated her idea of friendship. She had been a
  little fond of the woman, Olga, who had repaid her loyalty by a
  crude exhibition of jealousy.</p>

  <p>She shrugged away the memory. Here, under the limitless blue,
  people seemed so small&mdash;their passions so paltry. They were
  merely incidental to the passage from the cradle to the grave.
  One met them and parted from them, without regrets.</p>

  <p>Every minute the gap between her and them was widening. They
  were steaming away, out of her life. At the thought, she thrilled
  with a sense of new freedom, as though her spirit were liberated
  by the silence and solitude.</p>

  <p>Yet, before many hours had passed, she would have bartered all
  the glories of Nature to have called them back again.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE THREAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOME four hours later Iris lay spread-eagled on
  a slope of the mountain, high above the valley. Ever since she
  had left the chill twilight of the gorge, at a shrine which
  marked a union of paths, she had been climbing steadily upwards,
  by a steep zigzag track.</p>

  <p>After she had emerged from the belt of shadow, the sun had
  beat fiercely through her, but she did not slacken her pace. The
  fury of her thoughts drove her on, for she could not dislodge
  Olga from her mind.</p>

  <p>The name was like a burr on her brain. <i>Olga</i>. Olga had
  eaten her bread, in the form of toast&mdash;for the sake of her
  figure&mdash;and had refused her salt, owing to a dietetic fad.
  This had made trouble in the kitchen. Olga had used her
  telephone, and mis-used her car. Olga had borrowed her fur coat,
  and had lent her a superfluous husband.</p>

  <p>At the memory of Olga's Oscar, Iris put on a sprint.</p>

  <p>"As if I'd skid for a man who looks like Mickey Mouse," she
  raged.</p>

  <p>She was out of breath when, at last, she threw herself down on
  the turf and decided to call it a day. The mountain which had
  challenged her kept withdrawing as she advanced, so she had to
  give up her intention to reach the top.</p>

  <p>As she lay with her eyes almost closed, listening to the ping
  of the breeze, her serenity returned. A clump of harebells,
  standing out against the skyline, seemed hardened and magnified
  to a metallic belfry, while she, herself, was dwarfed and welded
  into the earth&mdash;part of it, like the pebbles and the roots.
  In imagination she could almost hear the pumping of a giant heart
  underneath her head.</p>

  <p>The moment passed, for she began to think of Olga again. This
  time, however, she viewed her from a different standpoint, for
  the altitude had produced the usual illusion of superiority. She
  reminded herself that the valley was four thousand feet above
  sea-level, while she had mounted about five thousand feet.</p>

  <p>On the basis of this calculation she could afford to be
  generous, since she was nine thousand feet taller than her former
  friend&mdash;assuming, of course, that Olga was obliging enough
  as to remain at sea-level.</p>

  <p>She decided to wash out the memory as unworthy of further
  anger.</p>

  <p>"But never again," she said. "After this, I'll never help any
  one again."</p>

  <p>Her voice had the passionate fervour of one who dedicates
  herself to some service. With the virtuous feeling of having
  profited by a lesson, for which heavy fees had been paid, she
  smoked a cigarette before the return journey. The air was so
  clear that mountains she had never seen before quivered out of
  invisibility and floated in the sky, in mauve transparencies. Far
  below she could see an arm of the lake&mdash;no longer green, but
  dimmed by distance to a misted blue.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly she rose to her feet. It was time to go.</p>

  <p>The descent proved not only monotonous, but painful, for the
  continual backward jolt of her weight threw a strain on
  unexercised muscles. Her calves began to ache and her toes were
  stubbed on the stony path.</p>

  <p>Growing impatient, she decided to desert the zigzag, in favour
  of a direct short-cut down the face of the mountain. With the
  lake as a guide to direction, she hurled herself down the
  slope.</p>

  <p>It was a bold venture, but almost immediately she found that
  the gradient was too steep. As she was going too quickly to stop,
  her only course was to drop down to a sitting posture and
  glissade over the slippery turf&mdash;trusting to luck.</p>

  <p>From that moment things happened quickly. Her pace increased
  every second, in spite of her efforts to brake with her feet.
  Patches of blue and green sped past her, as the valley rushed up
  to meet her, and smashed into the sky. Bumping over the rough
  ground, she steered towards a belt of trees at the bottom, in the
  hope that they might save her from a complete spill.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately they proved to be rotten from age, and she
  crashed through them, to land with a bump in the middle of the
  stony pass.</p>

  <p>Her fall had been partially broken, but she felt very sore and
  shaken as she scrambled to her feet. In spite of her injuries,
  she did not forget to give the forced laugh which had been
  drilled into her, at school, as the accompaniment to any game's
  casualty.</p>

  <p>"Rather amusing," she murmured, picking splinters out of her
  legs.</p>

  <p>But she was pleased to notice the shrine, a few yards farther
  up the track, for this was a definite tribute to her steering. As
  she was not far from the hotel, she clattered down the gully,
  thinking of the comforts which awaited her. A long cold drink, a
  hot bath, dinner in bed. When she caught sight of a gleam of
  water, at the bend of the gorge, in her eagerness she broke into
  a limping run.</p>

  <p>She rounded the corner and then stopped, staring before her in
  utter bewilderment. All the familiar landmarks had disappeared,
  as though some interfering person had passed an india-rubber over
  the landscape. There were no little wooden houses, no railway
  station, no pier, no hotel.</p>

  <p>With a pang of dismay she realised that she had steered by a
  faulty compass. This was not their familiar green lake, in which
  she and her friends had bathed daily. Instead of being deep and
  ovoid in shape, it was a winding pale-blue mere, with shallow
  rushy margins.</p>

  <p>In the circumstances, there was but one thing to
  do&mdash;retrace her steps back to the shrine and follow the
  other gully.</p>

  <p>It was definitely amusing and she achieved quite a creditable
  laugh before she began to plod slowly upwards again.</p>

  <p>Her mood was too bleak for her to appreciate the savage
  grandeur of the scenery. It was a scene of stark desolation,
  riven by landslips and piled high with shattered rocks. There was
  no crop of vegetation amid the boulders&mdash;no chirp of bird.
  The only sounds were the rattle of loose stones, dislodged by her
  feet, and the splash of a shrunken torrent, which foamed over its
  half-dried course, like a tangled white thread.</p>

  <p>Used to perpetual company, Iris began to long for faces and
  voices. In her loneliness, she was even reduced to the flabbiness
  of self-pity. She reminded herself that, when she returned to
  England, she would not go home, like others. She would merely go
  back.</p>

  <p>At present she was living at an hotel, for she had sublet her
  small luxury flat. Although her mode of living was her own
  choice, at such a time and such a place she felt that she paid a
  high price for freedom.</p>

  <p>Her mood did not last, for, at the top of the pass, she was
  faced with a call upon her fortitude. Casting about, to pick up
  her bearings, she made the discovery that the shrine was
  different from the original landmark where she had struck the
  mountain zigzag.</p>

  <p>This time she did not laugh, for she felt that humour could be
  carried too far. Instead she was furious with herself. She
  believed that she knew these mountains, because, with the others,
  she had clattered up and down the gorges, like a pack of wild
  goats.</p>

  <p>But she had merely followed&mdash;while others led. Among the
  crowd was the inevitable leader&mdash;the youth with the map.</p>

  <p>Thrown on her own resources, she had not the least idea of her
  direction. All she could do was to follow the gorge up to its
  next ramification and trust to luck.</p>

  <p>"If I keep on walking, I must get somewhere," she argued.
  "Besides, no one can get lost who has a tongue."</p>

  <p>She had need of her stoicism, for she had grown desperately
  weary, in addition to the handicap of a sore heel. When, at last,
  she reached a branch which gave her a choice of roads, she was
  too distrustful of her own judgement to experiment. Sitting down
  on a boulder, she waited on the chance of hailing some passer-
  by.</p>

  <p>It was her zero-hour, when her independence appeared only the
  faculty to sign cheques drawn on money made by others&mdash;and
  her popularity, but a dividend of the same cheques.</p>

  <p>"I've been carried all my life," she thought. "And even if
  some one comes, I'm the world's worst linguist."</p>

  <p>The description flattered her, for she had not the slightest
  claim to the title of linguist. Her ignorance of foreign
  languages was the result of being finished at Paris and Dresden.
  During the time she was at school, she mixed exclusively with
  other English girls, while the natives who taught her acquired
  excellent English accents.</p>

  <p>This was her rendering of the line in the National
  Anthem&mdash;"Send us victorious."</p>

  <p>Patriotism did not help her now, for she felt slightly
  doubtful when a thick-set swarthy man, wearing leather shorts and
  dirty coloured braces, swung up the pass.</p>

  <p>Among Iris' crowd was a youth who was clever at languages.
  From his knowledge of common roots, he had managed to use German
  as a kind of liaison language; but he had to draw on his
  imagination in order to interpret and be understood.</p>

  <p>Iris had a vivid recollection of how the crowd used to hoot
  with derision at his failures, when she called out to the man in
  English and asked him to direct her to the village.</p>

  <p>He stared at her, shrugged, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Her second attempt&mdash;in a louder key&mdash;met with no
  better success. The peasant, who seemed in a hurry, was passing
  on, when Iris barred his way.</p>

  <p>She was acutely aware of her own impotence, as though she were
  some maimed creature, whose tongue had been torn out. But she had
  to hold his attention, to compel him to understand. Feeling that
  she had lapsed from the dignity of a rational being, she was
  forced to make pantomimic gestures, pointing to the alternative
  routes in turn, while she kept repeating the name of the
  village.</p>

  <p>"He must get that, unless he's an idiot," she thought.</p>

  <p>The man seemed to grasp her drift, for he nodded several
  times. But, instead of indicating any direction, he broke into an
  unfamiliar jargon.</p>

  <p>As Iris listened to the torrent of guttural sounds, her nerve
  snapped suddenly. She felt cut off from all human intercourse, as
  though a boundary-line had been wiped out, and&mdash;instead of
  being in Europe&mdash;she were stranded in a corner of Asia.</p>

  <p>Without money and without a common language, she could wander
  indefinitely. At that moment she might be headed away from the
  village and into the wilds. The gorge had many tributary
  branches, like the windings of an inland sea.</p>

  <p>As she grew afraid, the peasant's face began to waver, like
  the illusion of some bad dream. She noticed that his skin
  glistened and that he had a slight goitre; but she was definitely
  conscious of his steamy goatish smell, for he was sweating from
  his climb.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand you," she cried hysterically. "I can't
  understand one word. Stop. Oh, <i>stop</i>. You'll drive me
  mad."</p>

  <p>In his turn the man heard only a string of gibberish. He saw a
  girl, dressed like a man, who was unattractively
  skinny&mdash;according to the local standard of beauty&mdash;with
  cut dirty knees. She was a foreigner, although he did not know
  her nationality. Further, she was worked up to a pitch of
  excitement, and was exceptionally stupid.</p>

  <p>She did not seem to grasp that she was telling him less than
  half the name of the village, whereas three different hamlets had
  the same prefix. He had explained this to her, and asked for the
  full word.</p>

  <p>Iris could not have supplied it even if she had understood the
  man. The name of the village was such a tongue-twister that she
  had never tried to disentangle it, but, like the rest, had called
  it by its first three syllables.</p>

  <p>The position was stalemate. With a final grimace and shrug,
  the peasant went on his way, leaving Iris alone with the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>They overhung her like a concrete threat. She had bought
  picture postcards of them and broadcast them with the stereotyped
  comment&mdash;"Marvellous scenery." Once she had even scrawled
  "This is my room," and marked a peak with a derisive cross.</p>

  <p>Now&mdash;the mountains were having their revenge. As she
  cowered under the projecting cliffs, she felt they had but to
  shake those towering brows, to crush her to powder beneath an
  avalanche of boulders. They dwarfed her to insignificance. They
  blotted out her individuality. They extinguished her spirit.</p>

  <p>The spell was broken by the sound of English voices. Round the
  bend of the pass came the honeymoon couple, from the hotel.</p>

  <p>This pair of lovers was respected even by the crowd, for the
  completeness of their reserve and the splendour of their
  appearance. The man was tall, handsome, and of commanding
  carriage. His voice was authoritative, and he held his head at an
  angle which suggested excessive pride. Waiters scampered at his
  nod, and the innkeeper&mdash;probably on the strength of his
  private sitting-room&mdash;called him "Milord."</p>

  <p>His wife was almost as tall, with a perfect figure and a
  flawless face. She wore beautiful clothes which were entirely
  unsuitable for the wilds; but it was obvious that she dressed
  thus as a matter of course, and to please only her husband.</p>

  <p>They set their own standard and appeared unconscious of the
  other visitors, who accepted them as belonging to a higher social
  sphere. It was suspected that the name "Todhunter," under which
  they had registered, was a fiction to preserve their
  anonymity.</p>

  <p>They passed Iris almost without notice. The man raised his hat
  vaguely, but his glance held no recognition. His wife never
  removed her violet eyes from the stony track, for her heels were
  perilously high.</p>

  <p>She was speaking in a low voice, which was vehement in spite
  of its muffled tone.</p>

  <p>"No darling. Not another day. Not even for <i>you</i>. We've
  stayed too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Iris lost the rest of the sentence. She prepared to follow
  them at a discreet distance, for she had become acutely aware of
  her own wrecked appearance.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the honeymoon pair had restored her sense of
  values. Their presence was proof that the hotel was not far away,
  for they never walked any distance. At the knowledge, the
  mountains shrank back to camera-subjects, while she was
  reconstructed, from a lost entity, to a London girl who was
  critical about the cut of her shorts.</p>

  <p>Very soon she recognised the original shrine, whence she had
  deserted the pass. Limping painfully down the track, presently
  she caught the gleam of the darkening lake and the lights of the
  hotel, shining through the green gloom.</p>

  <p>She began to think again of a hot bath and dinner as she
  remembered that she was both tired and hungry.</p>

  <p>But although apparently only the physical traces of her
  adventure remained, actually, her sense of security had been
  assailed&mdash;as if the experience were a threat from the
  future, to reveal the horror of helplessness, far away from all
  that was familiar.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">III. &mdash; CONVERSATION
  PIECE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the honeymoon pair returned to the hotel
  the four remaining guests were sitting outside on the gravelled
  square, before the veranda. They were enjoying the restful
  interlude of "between the lights." It was too dark to write
  letters, or read&mdash;too early to dress for dinner. Empty cups
  and cake crumbs on one of the tables showed that they had taken
  afternoon tea in the open and had not moved since.</p>

  <p>It was typical of two of them, the Misses Flood-Porter, to
  settle. They were not the kind that flitted, being in the fifties
  and definitely set in their figures and their habits. Both had
  immaculately waved grey hair, which retained sufficient samples
  of the original tint to give them the courtesy-title of blondes.
  They had also, in common, excellent natural complexions and
  rather fierce expressions.</p>

  <p>The delicate skin of the elder&mdash;Miss Evelyn&mdash;was
  slightly shrivelled, for she was nearly sixty, while Miss Rose
  was only just out of the forties. The younger sister was taller
  and stouter; her voice was louder, her colour deeper. In an
  otherwise excellent character, was a streak of amiable bully,
  which made her inclined to scold her partner at contract.</p>

  <p>During their visit, they had formed a quartette with the
  Reverend Kenneth Barnes and his wife. They had travelled out on
  the same train, and they planned to return to England together.
  The vicar and his wife had the gift of pleasant companionship,
  which the Misses Flood-Porter&mdash;who were without
  it&mdash;attributed to mutual tastes and prejudices.</p>

  <p>The courtyard was furnished with iron chairs and tables,
  enamelled in brilliant colours, and was decorated with tubs of
  dusty evergreen shrubs. As Miss Flood-Porter looked round her,
  she thought of her own delightful home in a Cathedral city.</p>

  <p>According to the papers, there had been rain in England, so
  the garden should look its best, with vivid green grass and lush
  borders of asters and dahlias.</p>

  <p>"I'm looking forward to seeing my garden again," she said.</p>

  <p>"Ours," corrected her sister, who was John Blunt.</p>

  <p>"And I'm looking forward to a comfortable chair," laughed the
  vicar. "Ha. Here comes the bridal pair."</p>

  <p>In spite of a sympathetic interest in his fellows he did not
  call out a genial greeting. He had learned from his
  first&mdash;and final&mdash;rebuff that they had resented any
  intrusion on their privacy. So he leaned back, puffing at his
  pipe, while he watched them mount the steps of the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Handsome pair," he said in an approving voice.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who they <i>really</i> are," remarked Miss Flood-
  Porter. "The man's face is familiar to me. I know I've seen him
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"On the pictures, perhaps," suggested her sister.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you go?" broke in Mrs. Barnes eagerly, hoping to claim
  another taste in common, for she concealed a guilty passion for
  the cinema.</p>

  <p>"Only to see George Arliss and Diana Wynyard," explained Miss
  Flood-Porter.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," said the vicar. "He's certainly not George
  Arliss, and neither is she Diana."</p>

  <p>"All the same, I feel certain there is some mystery about
  them," persisted Miss Flood-Porter.</p>

  <p>"So do I," agreed Mrs. Barnes. "I&mdash;I wonder if they are
  really married."</p>

  <p>"Are <i>you</i>?" asked her husband quickly.</p>

  <p>He laughed gently when his wife flushed to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to startle you, my dear," he said, "but isn't it
  simpler to believe that we are all of us what we assume to be?
  Even parsons and their wives." He knocked the ashes out of his
  pipe, and rose from his chair. "I think I'll stroll down to the
  village for a chat with my friends."</p>

  <p>"How can he talk to them when he doesn't know their language?"
  demanded Miss Rose bluntly, when the vicar had gone from the
  garden.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he <i>makes</i> them understand," explained his wife
  proudly. "Sympathy, you know, and common humanity. He'd rub noses
  with a savage."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we drove him away by talking scandal," said Miss
  Flood-Porter.</p>

  <p>"It was my fault," declared Mrs. Barnes. "I know people think
  I'm curious. But, really, I have to force myself to show an
  interest in my neighbour's affairs. It's my protest against our
  terrible national shyness."</p>

  <p>"But we're proud of that," broke in Miss Rose. "England does
  not need to advertise."</p>

  <p>"Of course not...But we only pass this way once. I have to
  remind myself that the stranger sitting beside me may be in some
  trouble and that I might be able to help."</p>

  <p>The sisters looked at her with approval. She was a slender
  woman in the mid-forties, with a pale oval face, dark hair, and a
  sweet expression. Her large brown eyes were both kind and
  frank&mdash;her manner sincere.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to connect her with anything but rigid
  honesty. They knew that she floundered into awkward explanations,
  rather than run the risk of giving a false impression.</p>

  <p>In her turn, she liked the sisters. They were of solid worth
  and sound respectability. One felt that they would serve on
  juries with distinction, and do their duty to their God and their
  neighbour&mdash;while permitting no direction as to its
  nature.</p>

  <p>They were also leisured people, with a charming house and
  garden, well-trained maids and frozen assets in the bank. Mrs.
  Barnes knew this, so, being human, it gave her a feeling of
  superiority to reflect that the one man in their party was her
  husband.</p>

  <p>She could appreciate the sense of ownership, because, up to
  her fortieth birthday, she had gone on her yearly holiday in the
  company of a huddle of other spinsters. Since she had left
  school, she had earned her living by teaching, until the miracle
  happened which gave her&mdash;not only a husband&mdash;but a
  son.</p>

  <p>Both she and her husband were so wrapped up in the child that
  the vicar sometimes feared that their devotion was tempting Fate.
  The night before they set out on their holiday he proposed a
  pact.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, looking down at the sleeping boy in his cot.
  "He is beautiful. But...It is my privilege to read the
  Commandments to others. Sometimes, I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," interrupted his wife. "Idolatry."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am as guilty as you," he admitted. "So I mean to discipline
  myself. In our position, we have special opportunities to
  influence others. We must not grow lop-sided, but develop every
  part of our nature. If this holiday is to do us real good, it
  must be a complete mental change...My dear, suppose we agree not
  to talk exclusively of Gabriel, while we are away?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes agreed. But her promise did not prevent her from
  thinking of him continually. Although they had left him in the
  care of a competent grandmother, she was foolishly apprehensive
  about his health.</p>

  <p>While she was counting the remaining hours before her return
  to her son, and Miss Flood-Porter smiled in anticipation of
  seeing her garden, Miss Rose was pursuing her original train of
  thought. She always ploughed a straight furrow, right to its
  end.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand how any one can tell a lie," she declared.
  "Unless, perhaps, some poor devil who's afraid of being sacked.
  But&mdash;people like <i>us</i>. We know a wealthy woman who
  boasts of making false declarations at the Customs. Sheer
  dishonesty."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, Iris appeared at the gate of the hotel garden.
  She did her best to skirt the group at the table, but she could
  not avoid hearing what was said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should not judge others," remarked Mrs. Barnes in
  the clear carrying voice of a form-mistress. "I've never felt the
  slightest temptation to tell a lie."</p>

  <p>"Liar," thought Iris automatically.</p>

  <p>She was in a state of utter fatigue, which bordered on
  collapse. It was only by the exercise of every atom of willpower
  that she forced herself to reach the hotel. The ordeal had
  strained her nerves almost to breaking-point. Although she longed
  for the quiet of her room, she knew she could not mount the
  stairs without a short rest. Every muscle felt wrenched as she
  dropped down on an iron chair and closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"If any one speaks to me, I'll scream," she thought.</p>

  <p>The Misses Flood-Porter exchanged glances and turned down the
  corners of their mouths. Even gentle Mrs. Barnes' soft brown eyes
  held no welcome, for she had been a special victim of the crowd's
  bad manners and selfishness.</p>

  <p>They behaved as though they had bought the hotel and the other
  guests were interlopers, exacting preferential
  treatment&mdash;and getting it&mdash;by bribery. This
  infringement of fair-dealing annoyed the other tourists, as they
  adhered to the terms of their payment to a travelling agency,
  which included service.</p>

  <p>The crowd monopolised the billiard-table and secured the best
  chairs. They were always served first at meals; courses gave out,
  and bath-water ran luke-warm.</p>

  <p>Even the vicar found that his charity was strained. He did his
  best to make allowance for the animal spirits of youth, although
  he was aware that several among the party could not be termed
  juvenile.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Iris' so-called friends included two persons
  who were no testimonial for the English nation; and since it was
  difficult to distinguish one girl in a bathing-brief from
  another, Mrs. Barnes was of the opinion that they were all doing
  the same thing&mdash;getting drunk and making love.</p>

  <p>Her standard of decency was offended by the sun-
  bathing&mdash;her nights disturbed by noise. Therefore she was
  specially grateful for the prospect of two peaceful days, spent
  amid glorious scenery and in congenial company.</p>

  <p>But, apparently, there was not a complete clearance of the
  crowd; there was a hangover, in this girl&mdash;and there might
  be others. Mrs. Barnes had vaguely remarked Iris, because she was
  pretty, and had been pursued by a bathing-gentleman with a
  matronly figure.</p>

  <p>As the man was married, his selection was not to her credit.
  But she seemed to be so exhausted that Mrs. Barnes' kindly heart
  soon reproached her for lack of sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Are you left all alone?" she called, in her brightest
  tones.</p>

  <p>Iris shuddered at the unexpected overture. At that moment the
  last thing in the world she wanted was mature interest, which, in
  her experience, masked curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, what a shame. Aren't you lonely?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But you're rather young to be travelling without friends.
  Couldn't any of your people come with you?"</p>

  <p>"I have none."</p>

  <p>"No family at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, and no relatives. Aren't I lucky?"</p>

  <p>Iris was not near enough to hear the horrified gasp of the
  Misses Flood-Porter; but Mrs. Barnes' silence told her that her
  snub had not miscarried. To avoid a further inquisition, she made
  a supreme effort to rise, for she was stiffening in every joint,
  and managed to drag herself into the hotel and upstairs to her
  room.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes tried to carry off the incident with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've blundered again," she said. "She plainly
  resented me. But it seemed hardly human for us to sit like
  dummies, and show no interest in her."</p>

  <p>"Is she interested in <i>you</i>?" demanded Miss Rose. "Or in
  us? That sort of girl is utterly selfish. She wouldn't raise a
  finger, or go an inch out of her way, to help any one."</p>

  <p>There was only one answer to the question, which Mrs. Barnes
  was too kind to make. So she remained silent, since she could not
  tell a lie.</p>

  <p>Neither she&mdash;nor any one else&mdash;could foretell the
  course of the next twenty-four hours, when this
  girl&mdash;standing alone against a cloud of
  witnesses&mdash;would endure such anguish of spirit as threatened
  her sanity, on behalf of a stranger for whom she had no personal
  feeling.</p>

  <p>Or rather&mdash;if there was actually such a person as Miss
  Froy.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">IV. &mdash; ENGLAND CALLING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BECAUSE she had a square on her palm, which,
  according to a fortune-teller, signified safety, Iris believed
  that she lived in a protected area. Although she laughed at the
  time, she was impressed secretly, because hers was a specially
  sheltered life.</p>

  <p>At this crisis, the stars, as usual, seemed to be fighting for
  her. The mountains had sent out a preliminary warning. During the
  evening, too, she received overtures of companionship, which
  might have delivered her from mental isolation.</p>

  <p>Yet she deliberately cut every strand which linked her with
  safety, out of mistaken loyalty to her friends.</p>

  <p>She missed them directly she entered the lounge, which was
  silent and deserted. As she walked along the corridor, she passed
  empty bedrooms, with stripped beds and littered floors.
  Mattresses hung from every window and the small verandas were
  heaped with pillows.</p>

  <p>It was not only company which was lacking, but moral support.
  The crowd never troubled to change for the evening, unless
  comfort suggested flannel trousers. On one occasion, it had
  achieved the triumph of a complaint, when a lady appeared at
  dinner dressed in her bathing-slip.</p>

  <p>The plaintiffs had been the Misses Flood-Porter, who always
  wore expensive but sober dinner-gowns. Iris remembered the
  incident, when she had finished her bath. Although slightly
  ashamed of her deference to public opinion, she fished from a
  suitcase an unpacked afternoon frock of crinkled crêpe.</p>

  <p>The hot soak and rest had refreshed her, but she felt lonely,
  as she leaned over the balustrade. Her pensive pose and the
  graceful lines of her dress arrested the attention of the
  bridegroom&mdash;Todhunter, according to the register&mdash;as he
  strolled out of his bedroom.</p>

  <p>He had not the least knowledge of her identity, or that he had
  acted as a sort of guiding-star to her, in the gorge. He and his
  wife took their meals in their private sitting-room and never
  mingled with the crowd. He concluded, therefore, that she was an
  odd guest whom he had missed in the general scramble.</p>

  <p>Approving her with an experienced eye, he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Quiet, to-night," he remarked. "Refreshing change after the
  din of that horrible rabble."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the girl looked coldly at him.</p>

  <p>"It is quiet," she said. "But I happen to miss my
  friends."</p>

  <p>As she walked downstairs she felt defiantly glad that she had
  made him realise his blunder. Championship of her friends
  mattered more than the absence of social sense. But, in spite of
  her triumph, the incident was vaguely unpleasant.</p>

  <p>The crowd had gloried in its unpopularity, which seemed to it
  a sign of superiority. It frequently remarked in complacent
  voices, "We're not popular with these people," or "They don't
  really like us." Under the influence of its mass-hypnotism, Iris
  wanted no other label. But now that she was alone, it was not
  quite so amusing to realise that the other guests, who were
  presumably decent and well-bred, considered her an outsider.</p>

  <p>Her mood was bleakly defiant when she entered the restaurant.
  It was a big bare room, hung with stiff deep-blue wallpaper,
  patterned with conventional gilt stars. The electric lights were
  set in clumsy wrought-iron chandeliers, which suggested a
  Hollywood set for a medieval castle. Scarcely any of the tables
  were laid, and only one waiter drooped at the door.</p>

  <p>In a few days, the hotel would be shut up for the winter. With
  the departure of the big English party, most of the holiday staff
  had become superfluous and had already gone back to their homes
  in the district.</p>

  <p>The remaining guests appeared to be unaffected by the air of
  neglect and desolation inseparable from the end of the season.
  The Misses Flood-Porter shared a table with the vicar and his
  wife. They were all in excellent spirits and gave the impression
  of having come into their own, as they capped each other's jokes,
  culled from Punch.</p>

  <p>Iris pointedly chose a small table in a far corner. She smoked
  a cigarette while she waited to be served. The others were
  advanced in their meal and it was a novel sensation for one of
  the crowd to be in arrears.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes, who was too generous to nurse resentment for her
  snub, looked at her with admiring eyes.</p>

  <p>"How pretty that girl looks in a frock," she said.</p>

  <p>"<i>Afternoon frock</i>," qualified Miss Flood-Porter. "We
  always make a point of wearing evening dress for dinner, when
  we're on the Continent."</p>

  <p>"If we didn't dress, we should feel we were letting England
  down," explained the younger sister.</p>

  <p>Although Iris spun out her meal to its limit, she was driven
  back ultimately to the lounge. She was too tired to stroll and it
  was early for bed. As she looked round her, she could hardly
  believe that, only the night before, it had been a scene of
  continental glitter and gaiety&mdash;although the latter quality
  had been imported from England. Now that it was no longer filled
  with friends, she was shocked to notice its tawdry theatrical
  finery. The gilt cane chairs were tarnished, the crimson plush
  upholstery shabby.</p>

  <p>A clutter of cigarette stubs and spent matches in the palm
  pots brought a lump to her throat. They were all that remained of
  the crowd.</p>

  <p>As she sat apart, the vicar&mdash;pipe in mouth&mdash;watched
  her with a thoughtful frown. His clear-cut face was both strong
  and sensitive, and an almost perfect blend of flesh and spirit.
  He played rough football with the youths of his parish, and,
  afterwards, took their souls by assault; but he had also a real
  understanding of the problems of his women-parishioners.</p>

  <p>When his wife told him of Iris' wish for solitude, he could
  enter into her feeling, because, sometimes, he yearned to escape
  from people and even from his wife. His own inclination was to
  leave her to the boredom of her own company; yet he was touched
  by the dark lines under her eyes and her mournful lips.</p>

  <p>In the end, he resolved to ease his conscience at the cost of
  a rebuff. He knew it was coming, because, as he crossed the
  lounge, she looked up quickly, as though on guard.</p>

  <p>"Another," she thought.</p>

  <p>From a distance she had admired the spirituality of his
  expression; but, to-night, he was numbered among her hostile
  critics.</p>

  <p>"Horrible rabble." The words floated into her memory, as he
  spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"If you are travelling back to England alone, would you care
  to join our party?"</p>

  <p>"When are you going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Day after to-morrow, before they take off the last through
  train of the season."</p>

  <p>"But I'm going to-morrow. Thanks so much."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll wish you a pleasant journey."</p>

  <p>The vicar smiled faintly at her lightning decision as he
  crossed to a table and began to address luggage-labels.</p>

  <p>His absence was his wife's opportunity. In her wish not to
  break her promise, she had gone to the other extreme and had not
  mentioned her baby to her new friends, save for one casual
  allusion to "our little boy." But, now that the holiday was
  nearly over, she could not resist the temptation of showing his
  photograph, which had won a prize in a local baby
  competition.</p>

  <p>With a guilty glance at her husband's back she drew out of her
  bag a limp leather case.</p>

  <p>"This is my large son," she said, trying to hide her
  pride.</p>

  <p>The Misses Flood-Porter were exclusive animal-lovers and not
  particularly fond of children. But they said all the correct
  things with such well-bred conviction that Mrs. Barnes' heart
  swelled with triumph.</p>

  <p>Miss Rose, however, switched off to another subject directly
  the vicar returned from the writing-table.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in warning dreams, Mr. Barnes?" she asked.
  "Because, last night, I dreamed of a railway smash."</p>

  <p>The question caught Iris' attention and she strained to hear
  the vicar's reply.</p>

  <p>"I'll answer your question," he said, "if you'll first answer
  mine. What <i>is</i> a dream? Is it stifled
  apprehension&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said a bright voice in Iris' ear, "I wonder if you
  would like to see the photograph of my little son, Gabriel?"</p>

  <p>Iris realised dimly that Mrs. Barnes&mdash;who was keeping up
  England in limp brown lace&mdash;had seated herself beside her
  and was showing her the photograph of a naked baby.</p>

  <p>She made a pretence of looking at it while she tried to listen
  to the vicar.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel," she repeated vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, after the Archangel. We named him after him."</p>

  <p>"How sweet. Did he send a mug?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes stared incredulously, while her sensitive face
  grew scarlet. She believed that the girl had been intentionally
  profane and had insulted her precious little son, to avenge her
  boredom. Pressing her trembling lips together she rejoined her
  friends.</p>

  <p>Iris was grateful when the humming in her ears ceased. She was
  unaware of her slip, because she had only caught a fragment of
  Mrs. Barnes' explanation. Her interest was still held by the talk
  of presentiments.</p>

  <p>"Say what you like," declared Miss Rose, sweeping away the
  vicar's argument, "I've common sense on my side. They usually try
  to pack too many passengers into the last good train of the
  season. I know I'll be precious glad when I'm safely back in
  England."</p>

  <p>A spirit of apprehension quivered in the air at her words.</p>

  <p>"But you aren't really afraid of an accident?" cried Mrs.
  Barnes, clutching Gabriel's photograph tightly.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Miss Flood-Porter answered for her sister.
  "Only, perhaps we feel we're rather off the beaten track here,
  and so very far from home. Our trouble is we don't know a word of
  the language."</p>

  <p>"She means," cut in Miss Rose, "we're all right over
  reservations and coupons, so long as we stick to hotels and
  trains. But if some accident happened to make us break our
  journey, or lose a connection, and we were stranded in some small
  place, we should feel <i>lost</i>. Besides it would be awkward
  about money. We didn't bring any travellers' cheques."</p>

  <p>The elder sister appealed to the vicar.</p>

  <p>"Do you advise us to take my sister's dream as a warning and
  travel back to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"No, <i>don't</i>," murmured Iris under her breath.</p>

  <p>She waited for the vicar's answer with painful interest, for
  she was not eager to travel on the same train as these
  uncongenial people, who might feel it their duty to befriend
  her.</p>

  <p>"You must follow your own inclinations," said the vicar. "But
  if you do leave prematurely, you will not only give a victory to
  superstition, but you will deprive yourself of another day in
  these glorious surroundings."</p>

  <p>"And our reservations, are for the day after to-morrow,"
  remarked Miss Rose. "We'd better not risk any muddles...And now,
  I'm going up to pack for my journey back to dear old
  England."</p>

  <p>To the surprise of every one her domineering voice suddenly
  blurred with emotion. Miss Flood-Porter waited until she had gone
  out of the lounge, before she explained.</p>

  <p>"Nerves. We had a very trying experience, just before we came
  away. The doctor ordered a complete change so we came here,
  instead of Switzerland."</p>

  <p>Then the innkeeper came in, and, as a compliment to his
  guests, fiddled with his radio, until he managed to get London on
  the long wave. Amid a machine-gun rattle of atmospherics, a
  familiar mellow voice informed them, "You have just been
  listening to..."</p>

  <p>But they had heard nothing.</p>

  <p>Miss Flood-Porter saw her garden, silvered by the harvest
  moon. She wondered whether the chrysanthemum buds, three to a
  pot, were swelling, and if the blue salvias had escaped the
  slugs.</p>

  <p>Miss Rose, briskly stacking shoes in the bottom of a suitcase,
  quivered at a recollection. Again she saw a gaping hole in a
  garden-bed, where overnight had stood a cherished clump of white
  delphiniums...It was not only the loss of their treasure, but the
  nerve-racking ignorance of where the enemy would strike
  next...</p>

  <p>The Vicar and his wife thought of their baby, asleep in his
  cot. They must decide whether they should merely peep at him, or
  risk waking him with a kiss.</p>

  <p>Iris remembered her friends in the roaring express, and was
  suddenly smitten with a wave of home-sickness.</p>

  <p>England was calling.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">V. &mdash; THE NIGHT EXPRESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IRIS was awakened that night, as usual, by the
  express screaming through the darkness. Jumping out of bed, she
  reached the window in time to see it outline the curve of the
  lake with a fiery wire. As it rattled below the hotel, the golden
  streak expanded to a string of lighted windows, which, when it
  passed, snapped together again like the links of a bracelet.</p>

  <p>After it had disappeared round the gorge, she followed its
  course by its pall of quivering red smoke. In imagination, she
  saw it shooting through Europe, as though it were an explosive
  shuttle ripping through the scorched fabric of the map. It caught
  up cities and threaded them on a gleaming whistling string.
  Illuminated names flashed before her eyes and were
  gone&mdash;Bucharest, Zagreb, Trieste, Milan, Basle, Calais.</p>

  <p>Once again she was flooded with home-hunger, even though her
  future address were an hotel. Mixed with it was a gust of
  foreboding&mdash;which was a legacy from the mountains.</p>

  <p>"Suppose&mdash;something&mdash;happened, and I never came
  back."</p>

  <p>At that moment she felt that any evil could block the way to
  her return. A railway crash, illness, or crime were
  possibilities, which were actually scheduled in other lives. They
  were happening all round her and at any time a line might give
  way in the protective square in her palm.</p>

  <p>As she lay and tossed, she consoled herself with the reminder
  that this was the last time she would lie under the lumpy feather
  bed. Throughout the next two nights she, too, would be rushing
  through dark landscape, jerked out of every brief spell of sleep
  by the flash of lights, whenever the express roared through a
  station.</p>

  <p>The thought was with her when she woke, the next morning, to
  see the silhouette of mountain-peaks iced against the flush of
  sunrise.</p>

  <p>"I'm going home to-day," she told herself exultantly.</p>

  <p>The air was raw when she looked out of her window. Mist was
  rising from the lake which gleamed greenly through yellowed fans
  of chestnut trees. But in spite of the blue and gold glory of
  autumn she felt indifferent to its beauty.</p>

  <p>She was also detached from the drawbacks of her room, which
  usually offended her critical taste. Its wooden walls were
  stained a crude shade of raw sienna, and instead of running water
  there was a battered washstand which bore a tin can, covered with
  a thin towel.</p>

  <p>In spirit, Iris had already left the hotel. Her journey was
  begun before she started. When she went down to the restaurant
  she was barely conscious of the other guests, who, only a few
  hours before, had inspired her with antipathy.</p>

  <p>The Misses Flood-Porter, who were dressed for writing letters
  in the open, were breakfasting at a table by the window. They did
  not speak to her, although they would have bowed as a matter of
  courtesy, had they caught her eye.</p>

  <p>Iris did not notice the omission, because they had gone
  completely out of her life. She drank her coffee in a silence
  which was broken by occasional remarks from the sisters, who
  wondered whether the English weather were kind for a local
  military wedding.</p>

  <p>Her luck held, for she was spared contact with the other
  guests, who were engrossed by their own affairs. As she passed
  the bureau, Mrs. Barnes was calling a waiter's attention to a
  letter in one of the pigeon-holes. Her grey jersey-suit, as well
  as her packet of sandwiches, advertised an excursion.</p>

  <p>The vicar, who was filling his pipe on the veranda, was also
  in unconventional kit&mdash;shorts, sweater, nailed boots, and
  the local felt hat&mdash;adorned with a tiny blue
  feather&mdash;which he had bought as a souvenir of his
  holiday.</p>

  <p>His smile was so happy that Iris thought he looked both
  festive and good, as though a saint had deserted his shrine,
  knocking his halo a trifle askew in the process, in order to put
  a coat of sunburn over his pallid plaster.</p>

  <p>Her tolerance faded as she listened to a dialogue which was
  destined to affect her own future.</p>

  <p>"Is that a letter from home?" called the vicar.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied his wife, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"I thought Grandma told us to expect no more letters...What's
  she writing about?"</p>

  <p>"She wants me to do a little shopping for her, on our way
  through London. Some Margaret Rose silk. The little Princess, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"But you'll be tired. It's not very considerate."</p>

  <p>"No." Mrs. Barnes' voice was exceptionally sharp. "It's not.
  Why didn't she think?"</p>

  <p>Iris condoned her own ungracious conduct of the preceding
  night, as she left them to their discussion. She told herself
  that he was justified in protecting herself from the boredom of
  domestic trifles.</p>

  <p>As she strolled past the front of the hotel, she had to draw
  back to avoid trespassing on the privacy of the honeymoon pair,
  whose sitting-room opened on to the veranda. They were
  breakfasting in the open air, off rolls and fruit. The man was
  resplendent in a Chinese dressing-gown, while his wife wore an
  elaborate wrapper over satin pyjamas.</p>

  <p>The Todhunters annoyed Iris, because they affected her with
  vague discontent. She was conscious of the same unacknowledged
  blank when she watched a love-scene played by two film stars.
  Theirs was passion&mdash;perfectly dressed, discreetly censored
  and with the better profile presented to the camera.</p>

  <p>She felt a responsive thrill when the man looked into his
  bride's eyes with intense personal interest.</p>

  <p>"Has it been perfect?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Todhunter knew exactly how long to pause before her
  reply.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>It was faultless timing for he understood what she did not
  say.</p>

  <p>"Not perfect, then," he remarked. "But, darling, is
  anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Iris passed out of earshot, while she was still slightly
  envious. Her own experience of love had been merely a succession
  of episodes which led up to the photographic farce of her
  engagement.</p>

  <p>The morning seemed endless, but at length it wore away. She
  had little to pack, because&mdash;following tradition&mdash;her
  friends had taken the bulk of her luggage with them, to save her
  trouble. An hour or two were killed, or rather drowned, in the
  lake, but she was too impatient to lie in the sun.</p>

  <p>After she had changed for her journey, she went down to the
  restaurant. The dish of the day was attractively jellied and
  garnished with sprigs of tarragon, chervil, and chopped eggs; but
  she suspected that it was composed of poached eels. Turning away,
  with a shudder, she took possession of a small buttercup-painted
  table in the gravelled garden, where she lunched on potato soup
  and tiny grapes.</p>

  <p>The sun flickered through the dense roof of chestnuts, but the
  iron chair was too hard and cold for comfort. Although the
  express was not due for more than an hour, she decided to wait
  for it at the railway station, where she could enjoy a view.</p>

  <p>She had worked herself up to a fever, so that the act of
  leaving the hotel seemed to bring her a step nearer to her
  journey. It gave her acute pleasure to pay her bill and tip the
  stragglers of the staff. Although she saw none of her fellow-
  guests, she hurried through the garden like a truant from school,
  as though she feared she might be detained, at the last
  minute.</p>

  <p>It was strange to wear a sophisticated travelling-suit and
  high heels again, as she jolted down the rough path, followed by
  a porter with her baggage. The sensation was not too comfortable
  after weeks of liberty, but she welcomed it as part of her return
  to civilisation. When she was seated on the platform, her
  suitcase at her feet, and the shimmer of the lake below, she was
  conscious of having reached a peak of enjoyment.</p>

  <p>The air was water-clear and held the sting of altitude. As the
  sun blazed down on her, she felt steeped in warmth and drenched
  in light. She took off her hat and gazed at the signal post,
  anticipating the thrill of its drop, followed by the first
  glimpse of a foreshortened engine at the end of the rails.</p>

  <p>There were other people on the platform, for the arrival of
  the express was the main event of the day. It was too early for
  the genuine travellers, but groups of loiterers, both visitors
  and natives, hung round the fruit- and paper-stalls. They were a
  cheerful company and noisy in many languages. Iris heard no
  English until two men came down the road from the village.</p>

  <p>They leaned over the palings behind her, to continue an
  argument. She did not feel sufficient interest, at first, to turn
  and see their faces, but their voices were so distinctive that,
  presently, she could visualise them.</p>

  <p>The one whom she judged the younger had an eager untidy voice.
  She felt sure that he possessed an active brain, with a rush of
  ideas. He spoke too quickly and often stumbled for a word,
  probably not because his terms were limited, but because he had a
  choice of too many.</p>

  <p>Gradually he won her sympathy, partly because his mind seemed
  in tune&mdash;or rather, in discord&mdash;with hers and partly
  because she disliked the other speaker instinctively. His accent
  was pedantic and consciously cultured. He spoke deliberately,
  with an irritating authority, which betrayed his inflexible mind.
  "Oh, no, my dear Hare." Iris felt it should have been 'Watson.'
  "You're abysmally wrong. It has been proved conclusively that
  there can be no fairer or better system of justice than trial by
  jury."</p>

  <p>"Trial by fatheads," spluttered the younger voice. "You talk
  of ordinary citizens. No one is ordinary, but a bag of his
  special prejudices. One woman's got a spite against her
  sex&mdash;one man's cranky on morality. They all damn the
  prisoner on different issues. And they've all businesses or homes
  which they want to get back to. They watch the clock and grasp
  the obvious."</p>

  <p>"They are directed by the judge."</p>

  <p>"And how much of his direction do they remember? You know how
  your own mind slips when you're listening to a string of words.
  Besides, after he's dotted all the is and crossed the is for
  them, they stampede and bring him in the wrong verdict."</p>

  <p>"Why should you assume it is wrong? They have formed their own
  conclusion on the testimony of the witnesses."</p>

  <p>"Witnesses." In his heat the young man thumped the railing.
  "The witness is the most damnable part of the outfit. He may be
  so stupid as to be putty in the hands of some wily lawyer, or he
  may be smart and lie away some wretched man's life, just to read
  about his own wonderful memory and powers of observation and see
  his photograph in the papers. They're all out for publicity."</p>

  <p>The elder man laughed in a superior manner which irritated his
  companion to the personal touch.</p>

  <p>"When I'm accused of bumping you off, professor, I'd rather be
  tried by a team of judges who'd bring trained legal minds and
  impartial justice to bear on the facts."</p>

  <p>"You're biased," said the Professor, "...Let me try to
  convince you. The Jury is intelligent in bulk, and can judge
  character. Certain witnesses are reliable, while others must be
  viewed with suspicion. For instance, how would you describe that
  dark woman with the artificial lashes?"</p>

  <p>"Attractive."</p>

  <p>"Hum. I should call her meretricious and so would any average
  man of the world. Now, we'll assume that she and that English
  lady in the Burberry are giving contrary evidence. One of the two
  must be telling a lie."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree. It may depend on the point of view. The man in
  the street, with his own back garden, is ready to swear to lilac
  when he sees it; but when he goes to a botanical garden he finds
  it's labelled syringa."</p>

  <p>"The generic name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. But if one honest John Citizen swears syringa
  is white, while another swears it's mauve, you'll grant that
  there is an opportunity for confusion. Evidence may be like
  that."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you wandered from my point?" asked the conventional
  voice. "Put those two women, separately, into the witness-box.
  Now <i>which</i> are you going to believe?"</p>

  <p>In her turn, Iris compared the hypothetical witnesses. One was
  a characteristic type of county Englishwoman, with an athletic
  figure and a pleasant intelligent face. If she strode across the
  station as though she possessed the right of way, she used it
  merely as a short cut to her legitimate goal.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the pretty dark woman was an obvious
  loiterer. Her skin-tight skirt and embroidered peasant blouse
  might have been the holiday attire of any continental lady; but,
  in spite of her attractive red lips and expressive eyes, Iris
  could not help thinking of a gipsy who had just stolen a chicken
  for the pot.</p>

  <p>Against her will, she had to agree with the professor. Yet she
  felt almost vexed with the younger man when he ceased to argue,
  because she had backed the losing side.</p>

  <p>"I see your point," he said. "The British waterproof wins
  every time. But Congo rubber was a bloody business and too
  wholesale a belief in rubber-proofing may lead to a bloody mix-
  up...Come and have a drink."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, if you will allow me to order it. I wish to avail
  myself of every opportunity of speaking the language."</p>

  <p>"Wish I could forget it. It's a disgusting one&mdash;all
  spitting and sneezing. You lecture on Modern Languages, don't
  you? Many girl students in your classes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes...Unfortunately."</p>

  <p>Iris was sorry when they moved away, for she had been idly
  interested in their argument. The crowd on the platform had
  increased, although the express was not due for another twenty-
  five minutes, even if it ran to time. She had now to share her
  bench with others, while a child squatted on her suitcase.</p>

  <p>Although spoiled by circumstances she did not resent the
  intrusion. The confusion could not touch her because she was held
  by the moment. The glow of sunshine, the green flicker of trees,
  the gleam of the lake, all combined to hypnotise her to a
  condition of stationary bliss.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to warn her of the attack. When she least
  expected it, the blow fell.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she felt a violent pain at the back of her neck.
  Almost before she realised it, the white-capped mountains rocked,
  the blue sky turned black, and she dropped down into
  darkness.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE WAITING-ROOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Iris became conscious, her sight returned,
  at first, in patches. She saw sections of faces floating in the
  air. It seemed the same face&mdash;sallow-skinned, with black
  eyes and bad teeth.</p>

  <p>Gradually she realised that she was lying on a bench in a dark
  kind of shed while a ring of women surrounded her. They were of
  peasant type, with a racial resemblance, accentuated by inter-
  marriage.</p>

  <p>They stared down at her with indifferent apathy, as though she
  were some street spectacle&mdash;a dying animal or a man in a
  fit. There was no trace of compassion in their blank faces, no
  glint of curiosity in their dull gaze. In their complete
  detachment they seemed devoid of the instincts of human
  humanity.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" she asked wildly.</p>

  <p>A woman in a black overall suddenly broke into guttural
  speech, which conveyed no iota of meaning to Iris. She listened
  with the same helpless panic which had shaken her yesterday in
  the gorge. Actually the woman's face was so close that she could
  see the pits in her skin and the hairs sprouting inside her
  nostrils; yet their fundamental cleavage was so complete that
  they might have been standing on different planets.</p>

  <p>She wanted some one to lighten her darkness&mdash;to raise the
  veil which baffled her and blinded her. <i>Something</i> had
  happened to her of which she had no knowledge.</p>

  <p>Her need was beyond the scope of crude pantomime. Only some
  lucid explanation could clear the confusion of her senses. In
  that moment she thought of the people at the hotel, from whom she
  had practically ran away. Now she felt she would give years of
  her life to see the strong saintly face of the clergyman looking
  down at her, or meet the kind eyes of his wife.</p>

  <p>In an effort to grip reality she looked round her. The place
  was vaguely familiar, with dark wooden walls and a sanded floor,
  which served as a communal spittoon. A bar of dusty sunlight,
  slanting through a narrow window, glinted on thick glasses
  stacked upon a shelf and on a sheaf of fluttering handbills.</p>

  <p>She raised her head higher and felt a throb of dull pain,
  followed by a rush of dizziness. For a moment she thought she was
  going to be sick; but the next second nausea was overpowered by a
  shock of memory.</p>

  <p>This was the waiting-room at the station. She had lingered
  here only only yesterday, with the crowd, as it gulped down a
  final drink. Like jolting trucks banging through her brain her
  thoughts were linked together by the connecting sequence of the
  railway. She remembered sitting on the platform, in the sunshine,
  while she waited for a train.</p>

  <p>Her heart began to knock violently. She was on her way back to
  England. Yet she had not the least idea as to what had happened
  after her black-out, or how long ago it had occurred. The express
  might have come&mdash;and gone&mdash;leaving her behind.</p>

  <p>In her overwrought state the idea seemed the ultimate
  catastrophe. Her head swam again and she had to wait for a mist
  to clear from her eyes before she could read the figures on her
  tiny wrist watch.</p>

  <p>To her joy she discovered that she had still twenty-five
  minutes in which to pull herself together before her journey.
  "What happened to me?" she wondered. "What made me pass out? Was
  I attacked."</p>

  <p>Closing her eyes, she tried desperately to clear her brain.
  But her last conscious moment held only a memory of blue sky and
  grass-green lake, viewed as though through a crystal.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she remembered her bag and groped to find it. To her
  dismay it was not beside her, nor could she see it anywhere on
  the bench. Her suitcase lay on the floor, and her hat had been
  placed on top of it, as though to prove the limit of her
  possessions.</p>

  <p>"My bag," she screamed, wild-eyed with panic. "Where's my
  bag?"</p>

  <p>It held not only her money and tickets, but her passport.
  Without it, it was impossible for her to continue her journey.
  Even if she boarded the train, penniless, she would be turned
  back at the first frontier.</p>

  <p>The thought drove her frantic. She felt sure that these ring
  women had combined to rob her when she was helpless and at their
  mercy. When she sprang from the bench they pulled her down
  again.</p>

  <p>The blood rushed to her head and she resisted them fiercely.
  As she struggled she was conscious of a whirl of
  confusion&mdash;of throbbing pain, rising voices, and lights
  flashing before her eyes. There were breathless panting noises,
  as an undercurrent to a strange rushing sound, as though an
  imprisoned fountain had suddenly burst through the ground.</p>

  <p>In spite of her efforts, the woman in the black pinafore
  dragged her down again, while a fat girl, in a bursting bodice,
  held a glass to her lips. When she refused to swallow they
  treated her like a child, tilting her chin and pouring the spirit
  down her throat.</p>

  <p>It made her cough and gasp, until her head seemed to be
  swelling with pain. Terrified by this threat of another attack,
  she relaxed in helpless misery. Her instinct warned her that, if
  she grew excited, at any moment, the walls might rock&mdash;like
  the snow-mountains&mdash;as a prelude to total extinction.</p>

  <p>Next time she might not wake up. Besides, she dared not risk
  being ill in the village, alone, and so far away from her
  friends. If she returned to the hotel she could enlist the
  financial help of the English visitors, while, doubtless, another
  passport could be procured; but it meant delay.</p>

  <p>In addition, these people were all strangers to her, whose
  holiday was nearly ended. In another day they would be gone,
  while she might be stranded there, indefinitely, exposed to
  indifference, and even neglect. The hotel, too, was closing down
  almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't be ill," thought Iris. "I must get away at once,
  while there is still time."</p>

  <p>She felt sure that, if she could board the train, the mere
  knowledge that she was rolling, mile by mile, back to
  civilisation, would brace her to hold out until she reached some
  familiar place. She thought of Basle on the milky jade Rhine,
  with its excellent hotels where English was spoken and where she
  could be ill, intelligibly, and with dignity.</p>

  <p>Everything hung upon the catching of this train. The issue at
  stake made her suddenly desperate to find her bag. She was
  struggling to rise again, when she became conscious that some one
  was trying to establish contact with her.</p>

  <p>It was an old man in a dirty blouse, with a gnarled elfin
  face&mdash;brown and lined as the scar on a tree-trunk, from
  which a branch had been lopped. He kept taking off his greasy hat
  and pointing, first upwards, and then to her head.</p>

  <p>All at once she grasped his meaning. He was telling her that
  while she sat on the platform she had been attacked with
  sunstroke.</p>

  <p>The explanation was a great relief, because she was both
  frightened and baffled by the mystery of her illness. She rarely
  ailed and had never fainted before. Besides, it had given her
  proof, that in spite of her own misgiving, the channels were not
  entirely blocked, provided the issues were not too involved.</p>

  <p>Although she still felt sick with anxiety about her train, she
  managed to smile faintly at the porter. As though he had been
  waiting for some sign of encouragement, he thrust his hand into
  the neck of his dirty blouse and drew out her bag.</p>

  <p>With a cry, she snatched it from him. Remembering the crowd on
  the platform, she had no hope of finding her money; but there was
  a faint chance that her passport had not been stolen.</p>

  <p>She tore at the zip-fastener with shaking fingers, to find, to
  her utter amazement, that the contents were intact. Tickets,
  money, passport&mdash;even her receipted hotel-bill, were still
  there.</p>

  <p>She had grossly maligned the native honesty, and she hastened
  to make amends. Here, at last, was a situation she understood. As
  usual, some one had come to her rescue, true to the tradition of
  the protective square in her palm. Her part, which was merely to
  overpay for services rendered, was easy.</p>

  <p>The women received their share of the windfall with stolid
  faces. Apparently they were too stunned with astonishment to show
  excitement or gratitude. The old porter, on the other hand,
  beamed triumphantly and gripped Iris' suitcase, to show that he,
  too, had grasped the situation.</p>

  <p>In spite of her resistance to it, the raw spirit, together
  with her change of circumstance, had revived Iris considerably.
  She felt practically restored again and mistress of herself as
  she showed her ticket to the porter.</p>

  <p>The effect on him was electric. He yammered with excitement,
  as he grabbed her arm and rushed with her to the door. Directly
  they had passed through it, Iris understood the origin of the
  curious pervading noise which had helped to complicate her
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>It was the gush of steam escaping from an engine. While she
  had let the precious minutes slip by, the express had entered the
  station.</p>

  <p>Now it was on the point of departure.</p>

  <p>The platform was a scene of wild confusion. Doors were being
  slammed. People were shouting farewells and crowding before the
  carriages. An official waved a flag and the whistle shrilled.</p>

  <p>They were one minute too late. Iris realised the fact that she
  was beaten, just as the porter&mdash;metaphorically snatched at
  the psychological moment, and was swung away with it on its
  flight. He took advantage of the brief interval between the first
  jerk of the engine and the revolution of the wheels to charge the
  crowd, like an aged tiger.</p>

  <p>There was still strength and agility in his sinewy old frame
  to enable him to reach the nearest carriage and wrench open the
  door.</p>

  <p>His entrance was disputed by a majestic lady in black. She was
  a personage to whom&mdash;as a peasant&mdash;his bones
  instinctively cringed. On the other hand, his patron had paid him
  a sum far in excess of what he earned in tips during the whole of
  a brief season.</p>

  <p>Therefore, his patron must have her place. Ducking under the
  august lady's arm, he hurled Iris' suitcase into the compartment
  and dragged her inside after it.</p>

  <p>The carriage was moving when he scrambled out, to fall in a
  heap on the platform. He was unhurt, however, for when she looked
  back to wave her thanks, he grinned at her like a toothless
  gnome.</p>

  <p>Already he was yards behind. The station slid by, and the lake
  began to lap against the piles of the rough landing-stage. It
  rippled past the window in a sheet of emerald, ruffled by the
  breeze and burnished by the sun. As the train swung round the
  curve of the rails to the cutting in the rocks, Iris looked back
  for a last view of the village&mdash;a fantastic huddle of
  coloured toy-buildings, perched on the green shelf of the
  valley.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">VII. &mdash; PASSENGERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the train rattled out of the cliff tunnel and
  emerged in a green tree-choked gorge, Iris glanced at her watch.
  According to the evidence of its hands, the Trieste express was
  not yet due at the village station.</p>

  <p>"It must have stopped when I crashed," she decided. "Sweet
  luck. It might have lost me my train."</p>

  <p>The reminder made her feel profoundly grateful to be actually
  on her way back to England. During the past twenty four hours she
  had experienced more conflicting emotion than in a lifetime of
  easy circumstance and arrangement. She had known the terrifying
  helplessness of being friendless, sick and penniless&mdash;with
  every wire cut. And then, at the worst, her luck had turned, as
  it always did.</p>

  <p>From force of contrast the everyday business of transport was
  turned into a temporary rapture. Railway travel was no longer an
  infliction, only to be endured by the aid of such palliatives as
  reservations, flowers, fruit, chocolates, light literature, and a
  group of friends to shriek encouragement.</p>

  <p>As she sat, jammed in an uncomfortable carriage, in train
  which was not too clean, with little prospect of securing a
  wagon-lit at Trieste, she felt the thrill of a first journey.</p>

  <p>The scenery preserved its barbarous character in rugged
  magnificence. The train threaded its way past piled-up chunks of
  disrupted landscape, like a Doré steel-engraving of Dante's
  Inferno. Waterfalls slashed the walls of granite precipices with
  silver-veining. Sometimes they passed arid patches, where dark
  pools, fringed with black-feathered rushes, lay in desolate
  hollows.</p>

  <p>Iris gazed at it through the screen of the window&mdash;glad
  of the protective pane of glass. This grandeur was the wreckage a
  world shattered by elemental-force, and reminded her it she had
  just been bruised by her first contact with reality.</p>

  <p>She still shrank from the memory of first facts, even although
  the nightmare railway station was the thick of the mountain away.
  Now that it was slipping farther behind the coils of the rails
  with every passing minute, she could dare to estimate the narrow
  margin by which she had escaped disaster.</p>

  <p>Amid the crowd at the station there must have been a
  percentage of dishonest characters, ready to take advantage of
  the providential combination of an unconscious
  foreigner&mdash;who did not count&mdash;and an expensive handbag
  which promised a rich loot. Yet the little gnome-like porter
  chanced to the man on the spot.</p>

  <p>"Things always do turn out for me," she thought. "But&mdash;it
  must be appalling for some of the others."</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had realised the fate of those
  unfortunates who had no squares in their palms. If there were
  railway accident, she knew that she would be in the un-wrecked
  middle portion of the train, just as inevitably as certain other
  passengers were doomed to be in the telescoped coaches.</p>

  <p>As she shuddered at the thought, she glanced idly at the woman
  who sat opposite to her. She was a negative type in every
  respect&mdash;middle-aged, with a huddle of small indefinite
  features, and vague colouring. Some one drew a face and then
  rubbed it nearly out again. Her curly hair was faded and her skin
  was bleached to oatmeal.</p>

  <p>She was not sufficiently a caricature to suggest a stage
  spinster. Even her tweed suit and matching hat were not too
  dowdy, although lacking any distinctive note.</p>

  <p>In ordinary circumstances, Iris would not have spared her
  second glance or thought. To-day, however, she gazed at her with
  compassion.</p>

  <p>"If <i>she</i> were in a jam, no one would help her out," she
  thought.</p>

  <p>It was discomforting to reflect that the population of the
  globe must include a percentage of persons without friends,
  money, or influence; nonentities who would never be missed, and
  who would sink without leaving a bubble.</p>

  <p>To distract her thoughts, Iris tried to look at the scenery
  again. But the window was now blocked by passengers, who were
  unable to find seats, so stood in the corridor. For the first
  time, therefore, she made a deliberate survey of the other
  occupants of her compartment.</p>

  <p>They were six in number&mdash;the proper quota&mdash;which she
  had increased to an illegal seven. Her side was occupied by a
  family party&mdash;two large parents and one small daughter of
  about twelve.</p>

  <p>The father had a shaven head, a little waxed moustache, and
  several chins. His horn-rimmed glasses and comfortable air gave
  him the appearance of a prosperous citizen. His wife had an oiled
  straight black fringe, and bushy eyebrows which looked as though
  they had been corked. The child wore babyish socks, which did not
  match her adult expression. Her hair had apparently been set,
  after a permanent wave, for it was still secured with clips.</p>

  <p>They all wore new and fashionable suits, which might have been
  inspired by a shorthand manual. The father wore stripe&mdash;the
  mother, spots&mdash;and the daughter, checks. Iris reflected idly
  that if they were broken up, and reassembled, in the general
  scramble, they might convey a message to the world in
  shorthand.</p>

  <p>On the evidence, it would be a motto for the home, for they
  displayed a united spirit, as they shared a newspaper. The mother
  scanned the fashions; the little girl read the children's page;
  and from the closely-printed columns Iris guessed that the head
  of the family studied finance.</p>

  <p>She looked away from them to the opposite side of the
  carriage. Sitting beside the tweed spinster was a fair pretty
  girl, who appeared to have modelled herself from the photograph
  of any blonde film actress. There were the same sleek waves of
  hair, the large blue eyes&mdash;with supplemented lashes, and the
  butterfly brows. Her cheeks were tinted and her lips painted to
  geranium bows.</p>

  <p>In spite of the delicacy of her features, her beauty was
  lifeless and standardised. She wore a tight white suit, with high
  black satin blouse, while her cap, gauntlet-gloves and bag were
  also black. She sat erect and motionless, holding a rigid pose,
  as though she were being photographed for a "still."</p>

  <p>Although her figure was reduced almost to starvation-point,
  she encroached on the tweed spinster's corner, in order to leave
  a respectful gap between herself and the personage had opposed
  Iris' entrance.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that this majestic lady belonged to the
  ruling classes. Her bagged eyes were fierce with pride, and her
  nose was an arrogant beak. Dressed and semi-veiled in heavy
  black, her enormous bulk occupied nearly half the seat.</p>

  <p>To Iris' astonishment, she was regarding her with a fixed
  stare of hostility. It made her feel both guilty and self-
  conscious.</p>

  <p>"I know I crashed the carriage," she thought. "But <i>she's
  got</i> plenty of room. Wish I could explain, for my own
  satisfaction."</p>

  <p>Leaning forward, she spoke impulsively to the personage.</p>

  <p>"Do you speak English?"</p>

  <p>Apparently the question was an insult, for the lady closed
  heavy lids with studied insolence, as though she could not endure
  a plebeian spectacle.</p>

  <p>Iris bit her lip as she glanced at the other passengers. The
  family party kept their eyes fixed on their paper&mdash;the tweed
  spinster smoothed her skirt, the blonde beauty stared into space.
  Somehow, Iris received an impression that this well-bred
  unconsciousness was a tribute of respect to the personage.</p>

  <p>"Is she the local equivalent to the sacred black bull?" she
  wondered angrily. "Can't any one speak until she does?...Well, to
  me, she's nothing but a fat woman with horrible kid gloves."</p>

  <p>She tried to hold on to her critical attitude, but in vain. An
  overpowering atmosphere of authority seemed to filtrate from the
  towering black figure.</p>

  <p>Now that her excitement was wearing off, she began to feel the
  after-effects of her slight sunstroke. Her head ached and back of
  her neck felt as stiff as though it had been reinforced by an
  iron rod. The symptoms warned her to be careful. With the threat
  of illness still hanging over her, she knew she should store up
  every scrap of nervous force, and not waste her reserves in
  fanciful dislikes.</p>

  <p>Her resolution did not save her from increasing discomfort.
  The carriage seemed not only stuffy, but oppressive with black
  widow's personality. Iris felt positive that she was a clotted
  mass of prejudices&mdash;an obstruction in the healthy life-
  stream of the community. Her type was always a clog on
  progress.</p>

  <p>As her face grew damp, she looked toward the closed windows of
  the compartment. The corridor-end, where she sat, was too crowded
  to admit any of the outer air, so she struggled to her feet and
  caught the other strap.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?" she asked with stressed courtesy, hoping, from
  her intonation, that the other passengers would grasp the fact
  that she was asking their permission before letting down the
  glass.</p>

  <p>As she expected, the man of the family party rose and took the
  strap from her. Instead of finishing the job, however, he glanced
  respectfully at the personage, as though she were sacrosanct, and
  then frowned at Iris, shaking his head the while.</p>

  <p>Feeling furious at the opposition, Iris returned to her
  corner.</p>

  <p>"I've got to take it," she thought. "Take it on the chin. I'm
  the outsider here."</p>

  <p>It was another novel sensation for the most popular member of
  the crowd, to be in a minority. Besides having to endure the lack
  of ventilation, the inability to explain her actions, or express
  a wish, gave her the stunted sense of being deprived of two
  faculties&mdash;speech and hearing.</p>

  <p>Presently the door was opened and a tall man squeezed into the
  carriage. Although she realised that her feelings had grown
  super-sensitive, Iris thought she had never seen a more repulsive
  face. He was pallid as potter's clay, with dead dark eyes, and a
  black spade beard.</p>

  <p>He bowed to the personage and began to talk to her, standing
  the while. His story was evidently interesting, for Iris noticed
  that the other passengers, including the child, were all
  listening with close interest.</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, his glasses flashed round the compartment,
  and finally rested on her. His glance was penetrating, yet
  impersonal, as though she were a specimen on a microscope-slide.
  Yet, somehow, she received the impression that she was not a
  welcome specimen, nor one that he had expected to see.</p>

  <p>Stooping so that his lips were on a level with the personage's
  ear, he asked a low-toned question. She replied in a whisper, so
  that Iris was reminded of two blowflies buzzing in a bottle.</p>

  <p>"Am I imagining things, or do these people really dislike me?"
  she wondered.</p>

  <p>She knew that she was growing obsessed by this impression of a
  general and secret hostility. It was manifestly absurd,
  especially as the man with the black spade beard had not seen her
  before. She had merely inconvenienced some strangers, from whom
  she was divided by the barrier of language.</p>

  <p>Shutting her eyes, she tried to forget the people in the
  carriage. Yet the presence of the man continued to affect her
  with discomfort. His white face seemed to break through her
  closed lids, and float in the air before her.</p>

  <p>It was a great relief when the buzzing ceased and she heard
  him go out of the compartment. Directly he had left, she grew
  normal again, and was chiefly conscious of a very bad headache.
  The most important things in life were tea and cigarettes; yet
  she dared not smoke because of the threat of sickness, while tea
  seemed a feature of a lost civilisation. The train was now
  rushing through a deserted country of rock and pine. The nearest
  reminder of habitation was an occasional castle of great
  antiquity, and usually in ruins. As she was gazing out at the
  fantastic scenery, an official poked his head in at the door and
  shouted something which sounded like blasphemy.</p>

  <p>The other passengers listened in apathy, but Iris began to
  open her bag, in case tickets or passport were required. As she
  did so, she was amazed to hear a crisp English voice.</p>

  <p>The tweed spinster had risen from her seat and was asking her
  a question.</p>

  <p>"Are you coming to the restaurant-car to get tea?"</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; TEA-INTERVAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IRIS was too stunned with surprise to reply. She
  looked incredulously at the sandy, spiny stretches, flowing past
  the window, as though expecting to see them turn to Swiss
  chalets, or blue Italian lakes.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she gasped, "you're English."</p>

  <p>"Of course. I thought I looked typical...Are you coming to
  tea?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>As Iris followed her guide out of the carriage, she was rather
  disconcerted to find that their compartment was at the end of the
  corridor. It looked as though her protective square had not
  insured her against railway smashes, after all.</p>

  <p>"Are we next to the engine?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," the tweed lady assured her. "There are ordinary
  coaches in between. It's an extra long train, because of the end
  of the season rush. They had to pack them in with a shoe-
  horn."</p>

  <p>Apparently she was the type that collected information, for
  she began to broadcast almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Just glance at the next carriage to ours as you go
  by&mdash;and I'll tell you something."</p>

  <p>Although Iris felt no curiosity, she obeyed. Afterwards she
  was sorry, because she could not forget what she saw.</p>

  <p>A rigid figure, covered with rugs, lay stretched on the length
  of one seat. It was impossible to tell whether it were a man or a
  woman, for head, eyes and forehead were bandaged, and the
  features concealed by a criss-cross of plaster strips. Apparently
  the face had been gashed to mutilation-point.</p>

  <p>Iris recoiled in horror, which was increased when she realised
  that the pallid man with the spade beard was in charge of the
  invalid. Beside him was a nun, whose expression was so callous
  that it was difficult to connect her with any act of mercy.</p>

  <p>While they chatted together, the patient feebly raised one
  hand. Although they saw the movement, they ignored it. They might
  have been porters, responsible for the transport of a bit of
  lumber, instead of a suffering human being.</p>

  <p>The fluttering fingers affected Iris with a rush of acute
  sympathy. She shrank from the thought that&mdash;had the cards
  fallen otherwise&mdash;she, too, might be lying, neglected by
  some indifferent stranger.</p>

  <p>"That nun looks a criminal," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"She's not a nun," the tweed lady informed her, "she's a
  nursing-sister."</p>

  <p>"Then I pity her patient. Ghastly to be ill on a journey. And
  she's not a spectacle. Why can't they pull down the blind?"</p>

  <p>"It would be dull for them."</p>

  <p>"Poor devil. I suppose it's a man?"</p>

  <p>Iris was so foolishly anxious to break the parallel between
  the motionless figure and herself, that she was disappointed when
  her companion shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, a woman. They got in at our station, higher up. The
  doctor was telling the baroness about it. She's just been
  terribly injured in a motor smash, and there's risk of serious
  brain injury. So the doctor's rushing her to Trieste, for tricky
  operation. It's a desperate chance to save her reason and her
  life."</p>

  <p>"Is that man with the black beard a doctor?" asked Iris.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Very clever, too."</p>

  <p>"Is he? I'd rather have a vet."</p>

  <p>The tweed lady, who was leading, did not hear her muttered
  protest. They had to force their way through the blocked
  corridors, and had covered about half the distance, when the
  spinster collided with a tall dark lady in grey, who was standing
  at the door of a crowded carriage.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," she apologised. "I was just looking out to
  see if our tea was coming. I gave the order to an attendant."</p>

  <p>Iris recognised Mrs. Barnes' voice, and shrank back, for she
  was not anxious to meet the vicar and his wife.</p>

  <p>But her companion gave a cry of delight.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're English, too," she said. "This is my lucky
  day."</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Barnes' soft brown eyes seemed to invite confidence,
  she added, "I've been in exile for a year."</p>

  <p>"Are you on your way home?" asked Mrs. Barnes, with ready
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I can't believe it. It's far too good to be true.
  Shall I send a waiter with your tea?"</p>

  <p>"That would be really kind. My husband is such a wretched
  traveller. Like so many big strong men."</p>

  <p>Iris listened impatiently, for her temples were beginning to
  throb savagely. Now that Mrs. Barnes had managed to introduce her
  husband's name into the conversation, she knew that her own tea
  might be held up indefinitely.</p>

  <p>"Aren't we blocking the way?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes recognised her with rather a forced smile, for the
  Gabriel episode still rankled.</p>

  <p>"Surprised to see us?" she asked. "We decided, after all, not
  to wait for the last through train. And our friends&mdash;Miss
  Flood-Porters, came with us. In fact, we're a full muster, for
  the honeymooners are here, too."</p>

  <p>Iris had struggled a little farther down the surging corridor,
  when the tweed lady spoke to her over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What a sweet face your friend has. Like a suffering
  madonna."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, she's very bright," Iris assured her. "And she's
  definitely not a friend."</p>

  <p>They crossed the last dangerously clanking connecting-way, and
  entered the restaurant-car, which seemed full already. The Misses
  Flood-Porter&mdash;both wearing well-cut white linen travelling-
  coats&mdash;had secured a table and were drinking tea.</p>

  <p>Their formal bow, when Iris squeezed by them, was conditional
  recognition before the final fade-out.</p>

  <p>"We'll speak to you during the journey," it seemed to say,
  "but at Victoria we become strangers."</p>

  <p>As Iris showed no inclination to join them, Miss Rose could
  not resist the temptation to manage a situation.</p>

  <p>"Your friend is trying to attract your attention," she called
  out.</p>

  <p>Iris turned and saw that her companion had discovered the last
  spare corner&mdash;a table wedged against the wall&mdash;and was
  reserving a place for herself. When she joined her, the little
  lady was looking round her with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"I ordered the tea for your nice friends," she said. "Oh,
  isn't all this <i>fun</i>?"</p>

  <p>Her pleasure was so spontaneous and genuine that Iris could
  not condemn it as gush. She stared doubtfully at the faded old-
  gold plush window-curtains, the smutty tablecloth, the glass dish
  of cherry jam&mdash;and then she glanced at her companion.</p>

  <p>She received a vague impression of a little puckered face; but
  there was a sparkle in the faded blue eyes, and an eager note in
  the voice, which suggested a girl.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, when she was trying to collect evidence of what
  she believed must be an extraordinary conspiracy, it was this
  discrepancy between a youthful voice and a middle-aged spinster,
  which made her doubt her own senses. In any case, her
  recollection was far from clear, for she did not remember looking
  consciously at her companion again.</p>

  <p>The sun was blazing in through the window, so that she shaded
  her eyes with one hand most of the time she was having tea. But
  as she listened to the flow of excited chatter, she had the
  feeling that she was being entertained by some one much younger
  than herself.</p>

  <p>"Why do you like it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because it's travel. We're moving. Everything's moving."</p>

  <p>Iris also had the impression that the whole scene was
  flickering like an early motion-picture. The waiters swung down
  the rocking carriage, balancing trays. Scraps of country flew
  past the window. Smuts rained down on the flakes of butter and
  the sticky cakes. Dusty motes quivered in the rays of the sun,
  and the china shook with every jerk of the engine.</p>

  <p>As she tried to drink some tea before it was all shaken over
  the rim of her cup, she learned that her companion was an English
  governess&mdash;Miss Winifred Froy&mdash;and was on her way home
  for a holiday. It came as a shock of surprise to know that this
  adult lady actually possessed living parents.</p>

  <p>"Pater and Mater say they can talk of nothing else but my
  return," declared Miss Froy. "They're as excited as children. And
  so is Sock."</p>

  <p>"Sock?" repeated Iris.</p>

  <p>"Yes, short for Socrates. The Pater's name for him. He is our
  dog. He's an Old English sheep-dog&mdash;not pure&mdash;but so
  appealing. And he's really devoted to me. Mater says he
  understands that I'm coming home, but not <i>when</i>. So the old
  duffer meets every train. And then the darling comes back, with
  his tail down, the picture of depression. Pater and Mater are
  looking forward to seeing his frantic joy the night I <i>do</i>
  come."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to see him," murmured Iris.</p>

  <p>The old parents' happiness left her unmoved, but she was
  specially fond of dogs. She got a clear picture of Sock&mdash;a
  shaggy mongrel&mdash;absurdly clownish and overgrown, with amber
  eyes beaming under his wisps, and gambolling like a puppy in the
  joy of reunion.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Miss Froy broke off, at a recollection.</p>

  <p>"Before I forget I want to explain why I did not back you up
  about the window. No wonder you thought I could not be English.
  It was stuffy&mdash;but I didn't like to interfere, because of
  the baroness."</p>

  <p>"D'you mean the appalling black person?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the baroness. I'm under an obligation to her. There was
  a muddle about my place in the train. I'd booked second-class,
  but there wasn't a seat left. So the baroness most kindly paid
  the difference, so that I could travel first-class, in her
  carriage."</p>

  <p>"Yet she doesn't look kind," murmured Iris.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she is rather overwhelming. But she's a member of the
  family to which I had the honour of being governess...It's not
  wise to mention names in public, but I was governess to the very
  highest in the place. These remote districts are still feudal,
  and centuries behind us. You can have no idea of the <i>power</i>
  of the&mdash;of my late employer. What he says <i>goes</i>. And
  he hasn't got to speak. A nod is enough."</p>

  <p>"Degrading," muttered Iris, who resented authority.</p>

  <p>"It is," agreed Miss Froy. "But it's in the atmosphere, and
  after a time one absorbs it and one grows spineless. And that's
  not English...I feel so reinforced, now I've met you. We must
  stick together."</p>

  <p>Iris made no promise. Her fright had not changed her
  fundamentally, only weakened her nerve. She had the modern
  prejudice in favour of youth, and had no intention of being tied
  to a middle-aged spinster for the rest of the journey.</p>

  <p>"Are you going back again?" she asked distantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but not to the castle. It's rather awkward, but I wanted
  another twelve months to perfect my accent, so I engaged to teach
  the children of the&mdash;Well, we'll call him the leader of the
  opposition."</p>

  <p>She lowered her voice to a whisper.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, there is a small but growing Communist element,
  which is very opposed to my late employer. In fact, they've
  accused him of corruption and all sorts of horrors. I don't ask
  myself if it's true, for it's not my business. I only know he's a
  marvellous man, with wonderful charm and personality. Blood
  tells...Shall I tell you something rather indiscreet?"</p>

  <p>Iris nodded wearily. She was beginning to feel dazed by the
  heat and incessant clatter. Her tea had not refreshed her, for
  most of it had splashed into her saucer. The engine plunged and
  jolted over the metals with drunken jerks, belching out wreaths
  of acrid smoke which streamed past the windows.</p>

  <p>Miss Froy continued her serial, while Iris listened in bored
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"I was terribly anxious to say 'Good-bye' to the&mdash;to my
  employer, so that I could assure him that my going over to the
  enemy&mdash;so to speak&mdash;was not treachery. His valet and
  secretary both told me that he was away at his hunting-lodge. But
  somehow I felt that they were putting me off. Anyway, I lay awake
  until early morning, before it was light, when I heard water
  splashing in the bathroom...Only one, my dear, for the castle
  arrangements were primitive, although my bedroom was like a stage
  royal apartment, all gilding and peacock-blue velvet, with a huge
  circular mirror let into the ceiling...Well, I crept out, like a
  mouse, and met him in the corridor. There we were, plain man and
  woman&mdash;I in my dressing-gown, and he in his bath-robe, and
  with his hair all wet and rough...But he was charming. He
  actually shook my hand and thanked me for my services."</p>

  <p>Miss Froy stopped to butter the last scrap of roll. As she was
  wiping her sticky fingers, she heaved a sigh of happiness.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," she said, "what a relief it was to leave
  under such pleasant circumstances. I always try to be on good
  terms with every one. Of course, I'm insignificant, but I can say
  truthfully that I have not got an enemy in the world."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">IX. &mdash; COMPATRIOTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"AND now," said Miss Froy, "I supposed we had
  better go back to our carriage, and make room for others." The
  waiter, who was both a judge of character and an opportunist,
  presented the bill to Iris. Unable to decipher the sprawling
  numerals, she laid down a note and rose from her seat.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you waiting for your change?" asked Miss Froy.</p>

  <p>When Iris explained that she was leaving it for a tip, she
  gasped.</p>

  <p>"But it's absurd. Besides, they've already charged their
  percentage on the bill...As I'm more familiar with the currency,
  hadn't I better settle up for everything? I'll keep an account,
  and we can get straight at our journey's end."</p>

  <p>The incident was fresh evidence of the smooth working of the
  protective-square system. Although Iris was travelling alone, a
  competent courier had presented herself, to rid her of all
  responsibilities and worries.</p>

  <p>"She's decent, although she's a crashing bore," she decided,
  as she followed Miss Froy down the swaying restaurant-car.</p>

  <p>She noticed that the Misses Flood-Porter, who had not finished
  their leisurely tea, took no notice of herself, but looked
  exclusively at her companion.</p>

  <p>Miss Froy returned Miss Rose's stare with frank interest.</p>

  <p>"Those people are English," she whispered to Iris, not knowing
  that they had met before. "They're part of an England that is
  passing away. Well-bred privileged people, who live in big
  houses, and don't spend their income. I'm rather sorry they're
  dying out."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Iris.</p>

  <p>"Because, although I'm a worker myself, I feel that nice
  leisured people stand for much that is good. Tradition, charity,
  national prestige. They may not think you're their equal, but
  their sense of justice sees that you get equal rights."</p>

  <p>Iris said nothing, although she admitted to herself that,
  while they were at the hotel, the Misses Flood-Porter were more
  considerate of person and property than her own friends.</p>

  <p>When they made their long and shaky pilgrimage through the
  train, she was amazed by Miss Froy's youthful spirits.</p>

  <p>Her laugh rang out whenever she was bumped against other
  passengers, or was forced, by a lurch of the engine, to clutch a
  rail.</p>

  <p>After they had pushed their way to a clearer passage, she
  lingered to peep through the windows of the reserved
  compartments. One of these specially arrested her attention and
  she invited Iris to share her view.</p>

  <p>"Do have a peek," she urged. "There's a glorious couple, just
  like film stars come to life."</p>

  <p>Iris was feeling too jaded to be interested in anything but a
  railway collision; but as she squeezed her way past Miss Froy,
  she glanced mechanically through the glass and recognised the
  bridal pair from the hotel.</p>

  <p>Even within the limits of the narrow coupé, the Todhunters had
  managed to suggest their special atmosphere of opulence and
  exclusion. The bride wore the kind of elaborate travelling-
  costume which is worn only on journeys inside a film studio, and
  had assembled a drift of luxurious possessions.</p>

  <p>"Fancy," thrilled Miss Froy, "they've got hot-house fruit with
  their tea. Grapes and nectarines...He's looking at her with his
  soul in his eyes, but I can only see her profile. It's just like
  a beautiful statue. Oh, lady, please turn your head."</p>

  <p>Her wish was granted, for, at that comment, Mrs. Todhunter
  chanced to glance towards the window. She frowned when she saw
  Miss Froy and spoke to her husband, who rose instantly and pulled
  down the blind.</p>

  <p>Although she was not implicated, Iris felt ashamed of the
  incident; but Miss Froy only bubbled with amusement.</p>

  <p>"He'll know me again," she said. "He looked at me as if he'd
  like to annihilate me. Quite natural. I was the World&mdash;and
  he wants to forget the World, because he's in paradise. It must
  be wonderful to be exclusively in love."</p>

  <p>"They may not be married," remarked Iris. "Any one can buy a
  wedding-ring."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;guilty love? Oh, no, they're too glorious.
  What name did they register under?"</p>

  <p>"Todhunter."</p>

  <p>"Then they <i>are</i> married. I'm so glad. If it was an
  irregular affair, they would have signed 'Brown,' or 'Smith.' It's
  always done."</p>

  <p>As she listened to the gush of words behind her, Iris was
  again perplexed by the discrepancy between Miss Froy's
  personality and her appearance. It was as though a dryad were
  imprisoned within the tree-trunk of a withered spinster.</p>

  <p>When they reached the end of the corridor, a morbid impulse
  made her glance towards the carriage which held the invalid. She
  caught a glimpse of a rigid form and a face hidden by its mass of
  adhesions, before she looked quickly away, to avoid the eyes of
  the doctor.</p>

  <p>They frightened her, because of their suggestion of baleful
  hypnotic force. She knew that they would be powerless to affect
  her in ordinary circumstances; but she was beginning to feel
  heady and unreal, as though she were in a dream, where every
  emotion is intensified.</p>

  <p>In all probability this condition was a consequent symptom
  <i>of</i> her sunstroke, and was due, partly, to her struggle to
  hold out, until she could collapse safely at her journey's end.
  She was directing her will-power towards one aim only, and
  therefore draining herself of energy.</p>

  <p>As a result she was susceptible to imaginary antagonism. When
  she caught sight of a blur of faces inside the gloom of her
  carriage, she shrank back, unwilling to enter.</p>

  <p>She received unexpected support from Miss Froy, who seemed to
  divine her reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Don't let's sit mum like charity-children any longer," she
  whispered. "Even if I am under an obligation to the baroness, I
  am going to remember that these people are only foreigners. They
  shan't impress me. We're English."</p>

  <p>Although the reminder was patriotism reduced to its lowest
  term of Jingoism, it braced Iris to enter the compartment with a
  touch of her old abandon. Precaution forgotten, she lit a
  cigarette without a glance at the other passengers.</p>

  <p>"Have you travelled much?" she asked Miss Froy.</p>

  <p>"Only in Europe," was the regretful reply. "Mater doesn't
  really like me going so far from home, but she holds the theory
  that the younger generation must not be denied their freedom.
  Still, I've promised to stick to Europe, although, whenever I'm
  near a boundary, I just ache to hop over the line to Asia."</p>

  <p>"Is your mother very old?"</p>

  <p>"No, she's eighty years young. A real sport, with the spirit
  of the modern girl. Pater is seventy-seven. He never let her know
  he was younger than she, but it leaked out when he had to retire
  at sixty-five. Poor Mater was terribly upset. She said, 'You have
  made me feel a cradle-snatcher.'...Oh, I can't believe I'm really
  going to see them again soon."</p>

  <p>As she listened, Iris watched the smoke curling up from her
  cigarette. Occasionally she saw a vague little puckered face
  swaying amid the haze, like an unsuccessful attempt at
  television. Out of gratitude for services rendered&mdash;and
  still to come&mdash;she tried to appreciate the old parents, but
  she grew very bored by the family saga.</p>

  <p>She learned that Pater was tall and thin, and looked
  classical, while Mater was short and stout, but dignified.
  Apparently Pater had unquenchable ardour and energy, for at the
  age of seventy he began to learn Hebrew.</p>

  <p>"He's made a detailed time-table for every month of his life,
  up to ninety," explained Miss Froy. "That's what comes of being a
  schoolmaster. Now, Mater is passionately fond of novels. Love
  ones, you know. She makes a long bus journey every week to change
  her library book. But she says she can't imagine them properly
  unless she makes me the heroine."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you had a marvellous time," said Iris.</p>

  <p>Miss Froy resented the attempt to be tactful.</p>

  <p>"Have, and had," she declared. "Pater was a parson before he
  kept a school, and his curates always proposed to me. I expect it
  is because I have fair curly hair...And I still have the
  excitement and hope of the eternal quest. I never forget that a
  little boy is born for every little girl. And even if we haven't
  met yet, we are both growing old together, and if we're fated to
  meet, we <i>shall</i>."</p>

  <p>Iris thought sceptically of the mature men who refuse to
  adhere to the calendar, as she listened with rising resentment.
  She wanted quiet&mdash;but Miss Froy's voice went on and on, like
  the unreeling of an endless talking-picture.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, Miss Froy recaptured her interest, for she
  began to talk of languages.</p>

  <p>"I speak ten, including English," she said. "At first, when
  you're in a strange country, you can't understand one word, and
  you feel like a puppy thrown into a pond. You flounder and
  struggle, so unless you want to drown you've simply got to pick
  it up. By the end of a year you're as fluent as a native. But I
  always insist on staying a second year, for the sake of idiomatic
  polish."</p>

  <p>"I expect foreigners to speak English," declared Iris.</p>

  <p>"When you're off the map they may not, and then you might find
  yourself in a terrible fix. Shall I tell you a true story?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for encouragement, Miss Froy spun a yarn which
  was not calculated to cool Iris' inflamed nerves. It was all very
  vague and anonymous, but the actual honor was stark.</p>

  <p>A certain woman had been certified as insane, but owing to a
  blunder the ambulance went to the wrong house and forcibly took
  away an Englishwoman, who did not understand a word of the
  language, or of her destination. In her indignation and horror at
  finding herself in a private asylum, she became so vehement and
  violent that she was kept, at first, under the influence of
  drugs.</p>

  <p>When the mistake was found out, the doctor&mdash;who was a
  most unscrupulous character, was afraid to admit it. At the time
  he was in financial difficulties, and he feared it might ruin his
  reputation. So he planned to detain the Englishwoman until he
  could release her as officially cured.</p>

  <p>"But she couldn't know she wasn't in for life," explained Miss
  Froy, working up the agony. "The horror of it would probably have
  driven her really insane, only a nurse exposed the doctor's plot,
  out of revenge...But can you imagine the awful position of that
  poor Englishwoman? Trapped, with no one to make inquiries about
  her, or even to know she had disappeared, for she was merely a
  friendless foreigner, staying a night here and a night there, at
  some Pension. She didn't understand a word&mdash;she couldn't
  explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please <i>stop</i>," broke in Iris. "I can imagine it all.
  Vividly. But would you mind if we stopped talking?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly. Aren't you well? It's difficult to be sure,
  with your sunburn, but I thought you looked green, once or
  twice."</p>

  <p>"I'm very fit, thanks. But my head aches a bit. I've just had
  a touch of sunstroke."</p>

  <p>"Sunstroke? When?"</p>

  <p>Knowing that Miss Froy's curiosity had to be appeased, Iris
  gave a brief account of her attack. As she did so, she glanced
  round the carriage. It was evident, from the blank faces,
  that&mdash;with one exception&mdash;the passengers did not
  understand English.</p>

  <p>Iris could not be certain about the baroness. She had the
  slightly stupid expression of an autocrat who has acquired power
  through birth, and not enterprise; yet there was a gleam of
  intelligence in her eyes that betrayed secret interest in the
  story.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you poor soul," cried Miss Froy, who overflowed with
  sympathy. "Why didn't you stop me chattering before? I'll give
  you some aspirin."</p>

  <p>Although she hated any fuss, it was a relief to Iris when she
  was able to sit back in her corner, while Miss Froy hunted the
  contents of her bag.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you had better have dinner in the restaurant-
  car," she decided. "I'll bring you something here, later. Now,
  swallow these tablets, and then try to get a little nap."</p>

  <p>After Iris had closed her eyes, she could still hear Miss Froy
  fluttering about her, like a fussy little bird, on guard.</p>

  <p>It gave her a curious sense of protection, while the carriage
  was so warm that she soon became pleasantly drowsy.</p>

  <p>As the drug began to take effect, her thoughts grew jumbled,
  while her head kept jerking forward. Presently she lost
  consciousness of place, as she felt herself moving onwards with
  the motion of the train, as though she were riding. Sometimes she
  took a fence, when the seat seemed to leap under her, leaving her
  suspended in the air.</p>

  <p>Clankety-clankety-clank. On and on. She kept moving steadily
  upwards. Clankety-clankety-clank. Then the rhythm of the train
  changed, and she seemed to be sliding backwards down a long
  slope. Click-click-click-click. The wheels rattled over the
  rails, with a sound of castanets.</p>

  <p>She was sinking deeper and deeper, while the carriage vibrated
  like the throbbing of an airplane. It was bearing her
  away&mdash;sweeping her outside the carriage&mdash;to the edge of
  a drop...</p>

  <p>With a violent start she opened her eyes. Her heart was
  leaping, as though she had actually fallen from a height. At
  first she wondered where she was; then as she gradually
  recognised her surroundings, she found that she was staring at
  the baroness.</p>

  <p>In slight confusion she looked away quickly to the opposite
  seat.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Miss Froy's place was empty.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">X. &mdash; THE VACANT SEAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IRIS was ungratefully glad of Miss Froy's
  absence. Her doze had confused rather than refreshed her, and she
  felt she could not endure another long installment of family
  history She wanted peace; and while it was impossible to have
  quiet amid the roar and rush of the train, she considered herself
  entitled, at least, to personal privacy.</p>

  <p>As regarded the other passengers, she was free from any risk
  of contact. Not one of them took the slightest notice of her. The
  baroness slept in her corner&mdash;the others sat motionless and
  silent. Inside the carriage, the atmosphere was warm and airless
  as a conservatory.</p>

  <p>It soothed Iris to a tranquil torpidity. She felt numbed to
  thought and feeling, as though she were in a semi-trance and
  incapable of raising a finger, or framing two consecutive words.
  Patches of green scenery fluttered past the window, like a flock
  of emerald birds. The baroness' heavy breathing rose and fell
  with the regularity of a tide.</p>

  <p>Iris vaguely dreaded Miss Froy's return, which must destroy
  the narcotic spell. At any moment, now, she might hear the brisk
  step in the corridor. Presumably Miss Froy had gone to wash, and
  had been obliged to wait her turn, owing to the crowd.</p>

  <p>Hoping for the best, Iris closed her eyes again. At first she
  was apprehensive whenever any one passed by the widow, but each
  false alarm increased her sense of security. Miss Froy ceased to
  be a menace and shrank to a mere name. The octogenarian parents
  went back to their rightful place inside some old photograph-
  album. Even Sock&mdash;that shaggy absurd mongrel, whom Iris had
  grown to like&mdash;was blurred to an appealing memory.</p>

  <p>Clankety-clankety-clank. The sound of breathing swelled to the
  surge of a heavy sea, sucking at the rocks. Muted by the thunder
  of the train, it boomed in unison with the throb of the engine.
  Clankety-clankety-clank.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the baroness' snores arose to an elephantine trumpet
  which jerked Iris awake. She started up in her seat&mdash;tense
  with apprehension and with every faculty keyed up. The shock had
  vibrated some seventh sense which made her expectant of disaster,
  as she glanced swiftly at Miss Froy's place.</p>

  <p>It was still empty.</p>

  <p>She was surprised by her pang of disappointment. Not long ago
  she had been praying for Miss Froy's return to be delayed; but
  now she felt lonely and eager to welcome her.</p>

  <p>"I expect I'll soon be cursing her again," she admitted to
  herself. "But, anyway, she is human."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the blonde beauty, who was beginning to remind
  her of a wax model in a shop window. Not a flat wave of her
  honey-gold hair was out of place. Even her eyes had the
  transparency of blue wax.</p>

  <p>Chilled by the contrast to the vital little spinster, Iris
  looked at her watch. The late hour, which told her that she had
  slept longer than she had suspected, also made her feel rather
  worried about Miss Froy's prolonged absence.</p>

  <p>"She's had enough time to take a bath," she thought.
  "I&mdash;I hope nothing's wrong."</p>

  <p>The idea was so disturbing that she exerted all her common
  sense to dislodge it.</p>

  <p>"Absurd," she told herself. "What could happen to her? It's
  not night, when she might open the wrong door by mistake, and
  step out of the train in the dark. Besides, she's an experienced
  traveller&mdash;not a helpless fool like myself. And she knows
  about a hundred languages."</p>

  <p>A smile flickered over her lips as she remembered one of the
  little spinster's confidences.</p>

  <p>"Languages give me a sense of power. If an international
  crisis arose in a railway carriage, and there were no
  interpreters, I could step into the breach and, perhaps, alter
  the destinies of the world."</p>

  <p>The recollection suggested an explanation for Miss Froy's
  untenanted seat. Probably she was indulging her social instincts
  by talking to congenial strangers. She was not divided from them
  by any barrier of language. Moreover, she was in holiday mood and
  wanted to tell every one that she was going home.</p>

  <p>"I'll give her another half-hour," decided Iris. "She must be
  back by then."</p>

  <p>As she looked out of the window, the clouded sky of late
  afternoon filled her with melancholy. The train had been
  gradually descending from the heights, and was now steaming
  through a lush green valley. Mauve crocuses cropped up amid thick
  pastures, which were darkened by moisture. The scene was
  definitely autumnal and made her realise that summer was
  over.</p>

  <p>The time slipped away too quickly, because she dreaded
  reaching the limit which she had appointed. If Miss Froy did not
  return she would have to make a decision, and she did not know
  what to do. Of course, as she reminded herself, it was not really
  her business at all; but her uneasiness grew with the passing of
  each five minutes of grace.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a stir among the other passengers. The
  little girl began to whine fretfully, while the father appeared
  to reason with her. Iris guessed that she had complained of
  sleepiness, and had been persuaded to take a nap, when she saw
  the mother's preparations to keep her daughter's trim appearance
  intact.</p>

  <p>After the black patent belt and the organdie collar had been
  removed, she drew out a net and arranged it carefully over the
  little girl's permanent wave. The blonde beauty showed her first
  signs of animation as she watched the process, but her interest
  died when the matron pulled off her child's buckled shoes and
  replaced them with a pair of shabby bedroom-slippers.</p>

  <p>Finally she pointed to Miss Froy's vacant place.</p>

  <p>Iris felt a rush of disproportionate resentment when she saw
  the little girl sitting in the spinster's seat. She wished she
  could protest by signs, but was too self-conscious to risk making
  an exhibition of herself.</p>

  <p>"When she comes back, Miss Froy will soon turn her out," she
  thought.</p>

  <p>Upon reflection, however, she was not so sure of direct
  action. When she remembered the friendly spirit Miss Froy
  displayed towards every one, she felt certain that she had
  already established a pleasant understanding with her fellow
  passengers.</p>

  <p>The little girl was so heavy with sleep that she closed her
  eyes directly she curled up in her corner. The parents looked at
  each other and smiled. They caught the blonde beauty's attention,
  and she, too, nodded with polite appreciation. Only Iris remained
  outside the circle.</p>

  <p>She knew that she was unjustly prejudiced, since she was the
  real interloper, yet she hated this calm appropriation of Miss
  Froy's place. It was as though the other passengers were taking
  unfair advantage of her absence&mdash;since she could not turn
  out a sleeping child.</p>

  <p>Or even as though they were acting on some secret
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>They were behaving as though they knew she was not coming
  back. In a panic, Iris looked at her watch, to find, to her
  dismay, that the half-hour had slipped away.</p>

  <p>The lapse of time was registered outside the window. The
  overcast sky had grown darker and the first mists were beginning
  to collect in the corners of the green saturated fields. Instead
  of crocuses, she saw the pallid fungoid growths of toadstools or
  mushrooms.</p>

  <p>As the sadness of twilight stole over her, Iris began to
  hunger for company. She wanted cheerful voices, lights, laughter;
  but although she thought wistfully of the crowd, she was even
  more anxious to see a little lined face and hear the high rushing
  voice.</p>

  <p>Now that she was gone, she seemed indefinite as a dream. Iris
  could not reconstruct any clear picture of her, or understand why
  she should leave such a blank.</p>

  <p>"What was she <i>like</i>?" she wondered.</p>

  <p>At that moment she chanced to look up at the rack. To her
  surprise, Miss Froy's suitcase was no longer there.</p>

  <p>In spite of logic, her nerves began to flutter at this new
  development. While she told herself that it was obvious that Miss
  Froy had moved to another compartment, the circumstances did not
  fit in. To begin with, the train was so overcrowded that it would
  be difficult to find an empty unreserved place.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Miss Froy had mentioned some muddle about
  her seat. It was barely possible that it had proved available,
  after all.</p>

  <p>"No," decided Iris, "the baroness had already paid the
  difference for her to travel first. And I'm sure she wouldn't
  leave me without a word of explanation. She talked of bringing me
  dinner. Besides, I owe her for my tea. I'm simply bound to find
  her."</p>

  <p>She looked at the other passengers, who might hold the key to
  the mystery. Too distracted now to care about appearances, she
  made an effort to communicate with them. Feeling that "English"
  was the word which should have lightened their darkness, she
  started in German.</p>

  <p>"Wo ist die dame <i>English</i>?"</p>

  <p>They shook their heads and shrugged, to show that they did not
  understand. So she made a second attempt.</p>

  <p>"Où est la dame <i>English</i>?"</p>

  <p>As no sign of intelligence dawned on their faces, she spoke to
  them in her own language.</p>

  <p>"Where is the English lady?"</p>

  <p>The effort was hopeless. She could not reach them, and they
  showed no wish to touch her. As they stared at her, she was
  chilled by their indifference, as though she were outside the
  pale of civilised obligations.</p>

  <p>Feeling suddenly desperate, she pointed to Miss Froy's seat,
  and then arched her brows in exaggerated inquiry. This time she
  succeeded in arousing an emotion, for the man and his wife
  exchange amused glances, while the blonde's lip curled with
  disdain. Then, as though she scented entertainment, the little
  girl opened her black eyes and broke into a snigger, which she
  suppressed instantly at a warning glance from her father.</p>

  <p>Stung by their ridicule, Iris glared at them, as she crossed
  to the baroness and shook her arm.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, please," she entreated.</p>

  <p>She heard a smothered gasp from the other passengers, as
  though she had committed some act of sacrilege. But she was too
  overwrought to remember to apologise, when the baroness raised
  her lids and stared at her with outraged majesty.</p>

  <p>"Where is Miss Froy?" asked Iris.</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy?" repeated the baroness. "I do not know any one who
  has that name."</p>

  <p>Iris pointed to the seat which was occupied by the little
  girl.</p>

  <p>"She sat <i>there</i>," she said.</p>

  <p>The baroness shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You make a mistake," she declared. "No English lady has sat
  there ever."</p>

  <p>Iris' head began to reel.</p>

  <p>"But she <i>did</i>," she insisted. "I talked to her. And we
  went and had tea together. You must remember."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to remember." The baroness spoke with slow
  emphasis. "I do not understand what you mean at all. I tell you
  this...There has been no English lady, here, in this carriage,
  never, at any time, except you. You are the only English lady
  here."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">XI. &mdash; NEEDLE IN A
  HAYSTACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IRIS opened her lips only to close them again.
  She had the helpless feeling of being shouted down by some
  terrific blast of sound. The baroness had made a statement which
  was an outrage on the evidence of her senses; but it was backed
  up by the force of an over-powering authority.</p>

  <p>As she held the girl's eye, challenging her denial, Iris
  looked at the leaden eyelids, the deep lines graven from nose to
  chin&mdash;the heavy obstinate chin. The lips were drawn down in
  a grimace which reminded her of a mask of the Muse of
  Tragedy.</p>

  <p>She realised that further protest was useless. The baroness
  would flatten down any attempt at opposition with relentless
  pressure. The most she could do was to acknowledge defeat with a
  shrug which disdained further argument.</p>

  <p>Her composure was only bluff for she felt utterly bewildered
  as she sank back in her seat. She was scarcely conscious of
  slides of twilight scenery streaming past the window, or of the
  other passengers. A village shot out of the shadows and vanished
  again in the dimness. She caught the flash of a huddle of dark
  roofs and the white streak of a little river, which boiled under
  a hooded bridge.</p>

  <p>The next second the church tower and wooden houses were left
  behind as the express rocked on its way back to England. It
  lurched and shrieked as though in unison with the tangle of Iris'
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"No Miss Froy? Absurd. The woman must be mad. Does she take me
  for a fool?...But why does she say it? <i>Why</i>?"</p>

  <p>It was this lack of motive which worried her most. Miss Froy
  was such a harmless little soul that there could be no reason for
  her suppression. She was on friendly terms with every one.</p>

  <p>Yet the fact remained that she had disappeared, for Iris was
  positive now that she would not come back to the carriage. In a
  sudden fit of nerves she sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"She must be somewhere on the train," she argued. "I'll find
  her."</p>

  <p>She would not admit it, but her own confidence was flawed by
  the difficulty of finding a reason for Miss Froy's absence. She
  had taken Iris under her wing, so that it was entirely out of
  line with her character as a kindly little busybody for her to
  withdraw in such an abrupt and final manner.</p>

  <p>"Does she think I might be sickening from some infectious
  disease?" she wondered. "After all, she's so terribly keen to get
  back to her old parents and the dog, that she wouldn't dare run
  risks of being held up. Naturally she would sacrifice me."</p>

  <p>Her progress down the train was a most unpleasant experience.
  It had been difficult when Miss Froy acted the part of a fussy
  little tug and had cleared a passage for her. Now that more
  passengers had grown tired of sitting in cramped compartments and
  had emerged to stretch, or smoke, the corridor was as closely
  packed with tourists as a melon with seeds.</p>

  <p>Iris did not know how to ask them to step aside and she did
  not like to push. Moreover, the fact that she was attractive did
  not escape the notice of some of the men. Each time a swerve of
  the express caused her to lurch against some susceptible
  stranger, he usually believed that she was making overtures.</p>

  <p>Although she grew hot with annoyance her chief emotion was one
  of futility. She had no hope of finding Miss Froy in such
  confusion. Whenever she passed each fresh compartment to peer
  inside she always saw the same blur of faces.</p>

  <p>Because she was beginning to run a temperature, these faces
  appeared as bleared and distorted as creations of a nightmare. It
  was a relief when she worked her way down the train, in an
  unavailing search, to see the vicar and his wife in one of the
  crowded carriages.</p>

  <p>They were sitting opposite each other. Mr. Barnes had closed
  his eyes and his face was set. In spite of his sunburn it was
  plain that he was far from well and was exerting his will-power
  to subdue his symptoms.</p>

  <p>His wife watched him with strained attention. She looked wan
  and miserable, as though&mdash;in imagination&mdash;she was
  sharing his every pang of train-sickness.</p>

  <p>She did not smile when Iris struggled inside and spoke to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to bother you but I'm looking for my friend."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes?"</p>

  <p>There was the familiar forced brightness in Mrs. Barnes' voice
  but her eyes were tragic.</p>

  <p>"You remember her?" prompted Iris. "She sent the waiter with
  your tea."</p>

  <p>The vicar came to life.</p>

  <p>"It was kind indeed," he said. "Will you give her my special
  thanks?"</p>

  <p>"When I find her," promised Iris. "She went out of the
  carriage some time ago&mdash;and she hasn't come back."</p>

  <p>"I haven't noticed her pass the window," said Mrs. Barnes.
  "Perhaps she went to wash. Anyway, she couldn't possibly be
  lost."</p>

  <p>Iris could see that she was concentrating on her husband and
  had no interest in some unknown woman.</p>

  <p>"Can I find her for you?" offered the vicar manfully,
  struggling to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not." His wife's voice was sharp. "Don't be absurd,
  Kenneth. You don't know what she looks like."</p>

  <p>"That's true. I should be more hindrance than help."</p>

  <p>The vicar sank back gratefully and looked up at Iris with a
  forced smile.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it humiliating to be such a wretched traveller?" he
  asked</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't talk," advised his wife.</p>

  <p>Iris took the hint and went out of the compartment. She, too,
  considered the vicar's weakness was a major misfortune. He was
  not only a man of high principle but she was sure that he
  possessed imagination and sympathy; yet she was unable to appeal
  to him for help because nature had laid him low.</p>

  <p>Because she was beginning to fear that she faced failure she
  grew more frantic with determination to find Miss Froy. If she
  failed she was loaded with a heavy responsibility.</p>

  <p>Of all the people in the train she&mdash;alone&mdash;seemed
  conscious of the disappearance of a missing passenger.</p>

  <p>She shrank from the prospect of trying to arouse these callous
  strangers from their apathy. As she clung to rails and was
  buffeted by the impacts of other tourists pushing their way past
  her, she hated them all. In her strung-up condition she could not
  realise that these people might experience her own sensations
  were they suddenly placed in a crowded London Tube or New York
  Subway and jostled by seemingly hostile and indifferent
  strangers.</p>

  <p>When she reached the reserved portion of the train, the blind
  was still pulled down over the Todhunters' window, but she
  recognised the Misses Flood-Porter in one of the reserved coupés.
  They sat on different sides of the tiny compartment&mdash;each
  with her feet stretched out on the seat. The elder lady wore
  horn-rimmed glasses and was reading a Tauchnitz, while Miss Rose
  smoked a cigarette.</p>

  <p>They looked very content with life and although kindhearted,
  the sight of others standing in the corridors subtly enhanced
  their appreciation of their own comfort.</p>

  <p>"Smug," thought Iris bitterly.</p>

  <p>They made her realise her own position. She reminded herself
  that her place, too, was in a reserved compartment, instead of
  fighting her way into the privacy of strange people.</p>

  <p>"Why am I taking it?" she wondered as she met the unfriendly
  glance of the ladies. Miss Rose's was perceptibly more frigid as
  though she were practising gradations, in preparation for the cut
  direct, at Victoria Station.</p>

  <p>At last she had combed the train with the exception of the
  restaurant-car. Now that tea was finished it was invaded by men
  who wanted to drink and smoke in comfort.</p>

  <p>As she lingered at the entrance to make sure that Miss Froy
  was not inside seeking her soul-mate of whom she had spoken, a
  hopeful young man touched Iris' arm. He said something
  unintelligible which she translated as an invitation to
  refreshment, and leered into her face.</p>

  <p>Furious at the liberty she shook him off and was on the point
  of turning away, when, amid the rumble of masculine voices, she
  distinguished the distinctive vowels of an Oxford accent.</p>

  <p>She was trying to locate it when she caught sight of the
  spade-bearded doctor. His bald, domed head, seen through the murk
  of smoke, reminded her of a moon rising through the mist. His
  face was blanched and bony&mdash;his dead eyes were magnified by
  his thick glasses.</p>

  <p>As they picked her out with an impersonal gaze, she felt as
  though she had been pinned down and classified as a type.</p>

  <p>Suddenly&mdash;for no reason at all&mdash;she thought of the
  doctor in Miss Froy's tale of horror.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">XII. &mdash; WITNESSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH she was conscious of the interest she
  aroused, Iris was too overwrought to care. Raising her voice she
  made a general appeal.</p>

  <p>"Please. Is there any one English here?"</p>

  <p>The spectacle of a pretty girl in distress made a young man
  leap to his feet. He was of rather untidy appearance with a
  pleasant ordinary face and audacious hazel eyes.</p>

  <p>"Can I be of use?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>The voice was familiar to Iris. She had heard it at the
  railway station, just before her sunstroke. This was the young
  man who had been opposed to trial by jury. He looked exactly as
  she had pictured him; he had even a rebellious tuft of hair, of
  the kind that lies down under treatment, as meekly as a trained
  hound, but which springs up again, immediately the brush is put
  away.</p>

  <p>In other circumstances she would have been attracted to him
  instinctively; but in this crisis he seemed to lack ballast.</p>

  <p>"Gets fresh with barmaids and cheeks traffic-cops," she
  reflected swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" prompted the young man.</p>

  <p>To her dismay Iris found it difficult to control her voice or
  collect her thoughts when she tried to explain the situation.</p>

  <p>"It's all rather complicated," she said shakily. "I'm in a
  jam. At least, it's nothing to do with me. But I'm sure there's
  some horrible mistake and I can't speak a word of this miserable
  language."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said the young man encouragingly. "I speak
  the lingo. Just put me wise to the trouble."</p>

  <p>While Iris still hesitated, doubtful of her choice of
  champion, a tall, thin man rose reluctantly from his seat, as
  though chivalry were a painful duty. In this case his academic
  appearance was not misleading, for directly he spoke Iris
  recognised the characteristic voice of the professor of modern
  languages.</p>

  <p>"May I offer my services as an interpreter?" he asked
  formally.</p>

  <p>"He's no good," broke in the young man. "He only knows
  grammar. But I can swear in the vernacular and we may need a spot
  of profanity."</p>

  <p>Iris checked her laugh for she realised that she was on the
  verge of hysteria.</p>

  <p>"An Englishwoman has disappeared from the train," she told the
  professor. "She's a <i>real</i> person, but the baroness
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice suddenly failed as she noticed that the doctor was
  looking at her with fixed attention. The professor's glacial eye
  also reminded her that she was making an exhibition of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Could you pull yourself together to make a coherent
  statement?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The chill in his voice was tonic for it braced her to compress
  the actual situation into a few words. This time she was careful
  to make no allusion to the baroness but confined herself to Miss
  Froy's non-return to the carriage. To her relief the professor
  appeared to be impressed for he rubbed his long chin gravely.</p>

  <p>"You said&mdash;an <i>English</i> lady?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Iris eagerly. "Miss Froy. She's a
  governess."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes...Now, are you absolutely certain that she is nowhere
  on the train?"</p>

  <p>"Positive. I've looked everywhere."</p>

  <p>"H'm. She would not be likely to leave her reserved seat for
  an inadequate reason. At what time precisely did she leave the
  compartment?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I was asleep. When I woke up she wasn't
  there."</p>

  <p>"Then the first step is to interview the other passengers. If
  the lady does not return by that time, I may consider calling the
  guard and asking for an official examination of the train."</p>

  <p>The young man winked at Iris, to direct her attention to the
  fact that the professor was in his element.</p>

  <p>"Gaudy chance for you to rub up the lingo, professor," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The remark reminded Iris that while the professor's
  acquaintance with the language would be academic, the young man
  probably possessed a more colloquial knowledge. This was
  important, since she was beginning to think that the confusion
  over Miss Froy sprang from the baroness' imperfect command of
  English. Her accent was good, but if she could not understand all
  that was said she would never admit ignorance.</p>

  <p>Determined to leave nothing to chance, Iris appealed to the
  frivolous youth.</p>

  <p>"Will you come, too, and swear for us?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Like a bird," he replied. "A parrot, I mean, of course. Lead
  on, professor."</p>

  <p>Iris' spirits rose as they made their way back through the
  train. Although she was still worried about Miss Froy, her
  companion infused her with a sense of comradeship.</p>

  <p>"My name's 'Hare,'" he told her. "Much too long for you to
  remember. Better call me Maximilian&mdash;or, if you prefer it,
  Max. What's yours?"</p>

  <p>"Iris Carr."</p>

  <p>"Mrs.?"</p>

  <p>"Miss."</p>

  <p>"Good. I'm an engineer, out here. I'm building a dam up in
  some mountains."</p>

  <p>"What fun. I'm nothing."</p>

  <p>Full of confidence in the support of her compatriots, Iris
  felt exultant as they neared her carriage. Tourists&mdash;seated
  on their suitcases&mdash;blocked the way and children chased each
  other, regardless of adult toes. As a pioneer Hare was better
  than Miss Froy. While she hooted to warn others of their
  approach, he rammed a clear passage, like an ice-plough.</p>

  <p>The professor stood aside to allow Iris to enter the
  compartment first. She noticed immediately that the spade-bearded
  doctor was seated beside the baroness and was talking to her in
  low rapid tones. He must have left the restaurant-car in a
  hurry.</p>

  <p>The fact made her feel slightly uneasy.</p>

  <p>"He's one jump ahead of me," she thought.</p>

  <p>The family party shared a bag of nectarines and took no notice
  of her, while the blonde was absorbed in rebuilding the curves of
  her geranium lips. The baroness sat unmoved as a huge black
  granite statue.</p>

  <p>There was a glint in Iris' eyes when she made her
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"Two English gentlemen have come to make some inquiries about
  Miss Froy."</p>

  <p>The baroness reared up her head and glared at her, but made no
  comment. It was impossible to tell whether the announcement were
  a shock.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly allow me to enter?" asked the professor.</p>

  <p>In order to make more room for the investigation, Iris went
  out into the corridor. From where she stood she could see the
  invalid's carriage and the nursing-sister who sat at the window.
  In spite of her preoccupation, she noticed that the woman's face
  was not repulsive but merely stolid.</p>

  <p>"Am I exaggerating everything?" she wondered nervously.
  "Perhaps, after all, I'm not reliable."</p>

  <p>In spite of her pity for the wretched patient it was a real
  relief when the original nurse, with the callous expression,
  appeared at the door. The fog of mystery, together with the throb
  of her temples, combined to make her feel uncertain of
  herself.</p>

  <p>She smiled when Hare spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to listen-in," he told her. "The professor's bound
  to be a don at theory, but he might slip up in practice, so I'll
  check up for you."</p>

  <p>Iris looked over his shoulder as she tried to follow the
  proceedings. The professor seemed to carry out his investigation
  with thoroughness, patience and personal dignity. Although he
  bowed to the baroness with respect, before he explained the
  situation, he conveyed an impression of his own importance.</p>

  <p>The personage inclined her head and then appeared to address a
  general question to her fellow passengers. Iris noticed how her
  proud gaze swept each face and that her voice had a ring of
  authority.</p>

  <p>Following her lead the professor interrogated every person in
  turn&mdash;only to receive the inevitable shake of the head which
  appeared the language of the country. Remembering her own
  experience Iris whispered to Hare.</p>

  <p>"Can't they understand him?"</p>

  <p>He replied by a nod which told her that he was listening
  closely and did not wish to be disturbed. Thrown on her own
  resources she made her own notes and was amused to remark
  that&mdash;in spite of being accustomed to teach mixed
  classes&mdash;the professor was scared of the ladies, including
  the little girl.</p>

  <p>Very soon he confined his questions to the business man who
  answered with slow deliberation. He was obviously trying to be
  helpful to a foreigner, who might have difficulty in
  understanding him. In the end he produced his card and gave it to
  the professor, who read it, and then returned it with a bow of
  thanks.</p>

  <p>In spite of the general atmosphere of politeness Iris grew
  impatient and tugged Hare's arm.</p>

  <p>"Is he finding out anything about Miss Froy?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She was unpleasantly surprised by his grave face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's rather involved," he told her. "All about where is
  the pen of the aunt of my gardener?"</p>

  <p>Her confidence began to cloud as she grew conscious of an
  unfriendly atmosphere. The baroness did not remove her eyes from
  her face during her short speech, to which the professor listened
  with marked respect. At its end she made a sign to the doctor, as
  though ordering him to support her statement.</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had been a silent witness of the scene. His white
  impassive face and dead eyes made him resemble one newly-returned
  from the grave, to attend a repeat performance of the revue of
  life&mdash;to its eternal damnation.</p>

  <p>But as he began to talk at his patron's bidding he grew vital
  and even vehement, for he used his hands to emphasise his
  words.</p>

  <p>When he had finished speaking the professor turned to
  Iris.</p>

  <p>"You appear to have made an extraordinary mistake," he said.
  "No one in this carriage knows anything about the lady you
  <i>say</i> is missing."</p>

  <p>Iris stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me I invented her?" she asked angrily.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know what to think."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll tell you. All these people are telling lies."</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke Iris realised the absurdity of her charge.
  It was altogether too wholesale. No rational person could believe
  that the passengers would unite to bear false witness. The family
  party in particular looked solid and respectable, while the
  father was probably the equivalent to her own lawyer.</p>

  <p>The professor was of the same opinion, for his manner grew
  stiffer.</p>

  <p>"The people whom you accuse of being liars are citizens of
  good standing," he said, "and are known personally to the
  baroness, who vouches for their integrity. The gentleman is not
  only a well-known banker in the district, but is also the
  baroness' banker. The young lady"&mdash;he glanced warily at the
  blonde&mdash;"is the daughter of her agent."</p>

  <p>"I can't help that," protested Iris. "All I know is that I'm
  owing Miss Froy for my tea. She paid for me."</p>

  <p>"We can check up on that," interrupted Hare. "If she paid,
  you'll be so much to the good. Just count up your loose
  cash."</p>

  <p>Iris shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how much I had," she confessed. "I'm hopeless
  about money. I'm always getting R.D. cheques."</p>

  <p>Although the professor's mouth turned down at the admission,
  he intervened in proof of his sense of fair play.</p>

  <p>"If you had tea together," he said, "the waiter should
  remember your companion. I'll interview him next, if you will
  give me a description of the lady."</p>

  <p>Iris had been dreading this moment because of her clouded
  recollection of Miss Froy. She knew that she had barely glanced
  at her the whole time they were together During tea she had been
  half-blinded by the sun, and when they returned to the carriage
  she had kept her eyes closed on account of her headache. On their
  way to and from the restaurant-car, she had always been either in
  front or behind her companion.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you much," she faltered. "You see, there's
  nothing much about her to catch hold of. She's middle-aged, and
  ordinary&mdash;and rather colourless."</p>

  <p>"Tall or short? Fat or thin? Fair or dark?" prompted Hare.</p>

  <p>"Medium. But she said she had fair curly hair."</p>

  <p>"'Said?'" repeated the professor. "Didn't you notice it for
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I think it looked faded. I remember she had blue
  eyes, though."</p>

  <p>"Not very enlightening, I'm afraid," remarked the
  professor.</p>

  <p>"What did she wear?" asked Hare suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Tweed. Oatmeal, flecked with brown. Swagger coat, finger-
  length, with patch pockets and stitched cuffs and scarf. The ends
  of the scarf were fastened with small blue-bone buttons and she
  wore a natural tussore shirt-blouse, stitched with blue&mdash;a
  different shade&mdash;with a small blue handkerchief in the
  breast-pocket. I'm afraid I didn't notice details much. Her hat
  was made of the same material, with a stitched brim and a
  Récamier crown, with a funny bright-blue feather stuck through
  the band."</p>

  <p>"Stop," commanded Hare. "Now that you've remembered the hat,
  can't you make another effort and put a face under it?"</p>

  <p>He was so delighted with the result of his experiment that his
  dejection was ludicrous when Iris shook her head in the old
  provoking manner.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't remember any face. You see, I had such a frantic
  headache."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," commented the professor dryly. "Cause and effect,
  I'm afraid. The doctor has been telling us that you had a slight
  sunstroke."</p>

  <p>As though awaiting his cue the doctor&mdash;who had been
  listening intently&mdash;spoke to Iris.</p>

  <p>"That blow of the sun explains all," he said, speaking in
  English, with slow emphasis. "It has given you a delirium. You
  saw some one who is not there. Afterwards, you went to sleep, and
  you dream. Then, presently, you awake and you are much better. So
  you saw Miss Froy no more...She is nothing but a delirium&mdash;a
  dream."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; A DREAM WITHIN A
  DREAM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT first Iris was too surprised to protest. She
  had the bewildered sensation of being the one sane person in a
  mad world. Her astonishment turned to indignation when the
  professor caught Hare's eye and gave a nod of mutual
  understanding.</p>

  <p>Then he spoke to Iris in a formal voice.</p>

  <p>"I think we may accept that as final. If I had known the
  circumstances I should not have intervened. I hope you will soon
  feel better."</p>

  <p>"We'd better clear and let Miss Carr get some quiet,"
  suggested Hare, with a doubtful grin.</p>

  <p>Iris felt as though she were being smothered with featherbed
  opposition. Controlling her anger she forced herself to speak
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's not so simple as that. As far as I'm
  concerned the matter's by no means ended. Why should you imagine
  I'm telling a lie?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," the professor assured her. "I am convinced it is
  your mistake. But, since you've raised the point of fairness, you
  must admit that the weight of evidence is against you. I have to
  be fair...Can you explain why six persons should lie?"</p>

  <p>Iris had a sudden flash of intuition.</p>

  <p>"I can't," she said, "unless one person started the lie, and
  the others are backing her up. In that case it's only her word
  against mine. And as I'm English and you're English and this
  concerns an Englishwoman, it's your duty to believe me."</p>

  <p>As she spoke Iris challenged the baroness in an accusing
  stare. Although the personage heard the charge with complete
  composure, the professor coughed in protest.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't confuse patriotism with prejudice," he said.
  "Besides your insinuation is absurd. What motive would the
  baroness have for telling a lie?"</p>

  <p>Iris' brain began to swim.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said weakly. "It's all such a mystery. No
  one could want to injure Miss Froy. She's too insignificant.
  Besides, she was proud of having no enemies. And she told me
  herself that the baroness had been kind."</p>

  <p>"What have I done?" asked the baroness blandly.</p>

  <p>"She said that there was a muddle about her place and you paid
  the excess-fare for her to travel in here."</p>

  <p>"That was charming of me. I'm gratified to hear of my
  generosity. Unfortunately I know nothing of it. But the ticket-
  collector should be able to refresh my memory."</p>

  <p>The professor turned to Iris dutifully.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" he asked. "You are making things rather
  difficult by persisting in this attitude. But, if you insist, I
  will question the man."</p>

  <p>"I'll dig him out," offered Hare.</p>

  <p>Iris knew that he wanted a chance to escape. She felt that his
  sympathies were with her while he withheld his faith.</p>

  <p>After he had gone the professor began to talk to the baroness
  and the doctor, presumably for the sake of further practice.
  Suspicious of every glance and inflection, Iris believed that he
  was explaining the delicacy of his position and stressing the
  absurdity of the charge, for the baroness looked almost as
  benevolent as a sated tigress that kills just for the sport.</p>

  <p>She was glad when Hare&mdash;his rebellious tuft sticking out
  like a feather&mdash;battled his way down the corridor, followed
  by the ticket-collector. He was a sturdy young man, in a very
  tight uniform and he reminded Iris of a toy soldier, with two
  blobs of crimson-colour on his broad cheeks and a tiny black
  waxed moustache.</p>

  <p>As he entered the baroness spoke to him sharply and then waved
  to the professor to continue.</p>

  <p>By this time Iris' nerve was shattered; she was so sure that
  the ticket-collector would prove another victim to mass-hypnotism
  that she was prepared when Hare made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"He's telling the old, old story," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course he is." Iris tried to laugh. "I expect he was one
  of her peasants. He looks bucolic. She seems to own the
  lot&mdash;including you and the professor."</p>

  <p>"Now, don't get het up," he urged. "I know just what you are
  feeling, because I've been through this myself. I'll tell you
  about it, if I can dislodge this young lady."</p>

  <p>The little girl, who had been making precocious eyes at Hare,
  responded to his invitation to move with shrugs and pouts of
  protest. All the same she reluctantly went back to her original
  place, while he squeezed into the corner originally occupied by
  the elusive spinster.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up," he said. "Unless your Miss Froy was invisible,
  other people in the train must have seen her."</p>

  <p>"I know," nodded Iris. "But I can't think. My brain's too
  sticky."</p>

  <p>The professor, who was just leaving the compartment, caught
  the drift of Hare's argument, for he turned back to speak to
  Iris.</p>

  <p>"If you can produce some definite proof of this lady's
  existence, I'm still open to conviction. But I sincerely hope
  that you will not expose us and yourself to further
  ridicule."</p>

  <p>Iris felt too limp for defiance.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said meekly. "Where shall I find you?"</p>

  <p>"In the reserved portion."</p>

  <p>"We're sharing a bunny-hutch," supplemented Hare. "Didn't you
  know we're rich? We started a prosperity chain."</p>

  <p>"I hate that man," burst out Iris when the professor had
  gone.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," protested Hare, "he's not a bad old fossil. You've
  got him scared stiff because you're young and attractive."</p>

  <p>Then the grin faded from his lips.</p>

  <p>"I want to bore you with a true story," he said. "Some years
  ago, I was playing in an international at Twickenham. Just before
  the match both teams were presented to the Prince of Wales and he
  shook hands with all of us. Well, after I'd scored the winning
  try&mdash;I had to slip that in&mdash;I got kicked on the head in
  a scrum and passed out. Later on, when I was fairly comfortable
  in a private ward at the hospital, the nurse came in, all of a
  flutter, and said there was a special visitor to see me."</p>

  <p>"The Prince?" asked Iris, trying to force an intelligent
  interest.</p>

  <p>"The same. Of course, he didn't stay more than a minute. Just
  smiled at me and said he hoped I'd soon be all right and he was
  sorry about my accident. I was so steamed up I thought I wouldn't
  sleep a wink, but I dropped off the instant he had gone. Next
  morning the nurses said, 'Weren't you pleased to see your
  captain?'"</p>

  <p>"Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the captain of the team. It was definitely not the
  Prince...And yet I saw him as plainly as I see you. He shook
  hands with me and said something nice about my try. He was
  <i>real</i>. And that's what a spot of head trouble can do to the
  best of us."</p>

  <p>Iris set her lips obstinately.</p>

  <p>"I thought you believed in me," she said. "But you're like the
  rest. Please go away."</p>

  <p>"I will, because I'm sure you ought to keep quiet. Try and get
  some sleep."</p>

  <p>"No. I've got to think this out. If I let myself believe all
  of you, I should be afraid I was getting mental. And I'm not. I'm
  <i>not</i>."</p>

  <p>"Now take it easy."</p>

  <p>"What a soothing nurse you'd make. You only want a silly cap.
  Listen." Iris dropped her voice. "I'm extra in the dark, because
  I couldn't understand these questions. Do you really know the
  language?"</p>

  <p>"Better than English now. And it was so elementary that even
  the professor couldn't slip up. Sorry&mdash;but there are no
  holes anywhere...But you look all in. Let me get you a life-
  saver."</p>

  <p>"No. Miss Froy promised she'd get me something and I prefer to
  wait for her."</p>

  <p>Her defiant eyes told Hare that she was nailing her colours to
  the mast. Since he regarded Miss Froy as a kind of ghost, he did
  not think that Iris would derive benefit from anything she might
  bring, so he resolved to renew his offer later. Meanwhile he
  could serve her best by leaving her alone.</p>

  <p>Just as he was going he remembered something and beckoned Iris
  into the corridor.</p>

  <p>"There was just one bit I didn't tumble to," he confessed.
  "The baroness spoke to the ticket chap in a dialect which was
  Chinese to me."</p>

  <p>"Then that proves they came from the same district," cried
  Iris triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Hum. But as we don't know what she said it's not too helpful.
  Salaams. See you later."</p>

  <p>After Hare had gone Iris crouched in her corner, rocking with
  the vibration of the train. It was clattering through a
  succession of short tunnels and the air was full of sound, as
  though a giant roller were flattening out the sky. The noise
  worried her acutely. She had scarcely eaten all day and was
  beginning to feel exhausted. But although she was unused to being
  ill, and was consequently frightened, she was far more alarmed by
  the jangling of her brain.</p>

  <p>She started violently when a nursing-sister appeared in the
  doorway and beckoned to the doctor. She hardly noticed the relief
  of his absence, because her thoughts raced in a confused circle
  round the central incident of the black-out.</p>

  <p>"I was on the platform, one second&mdash;and the next second I
  went out. Where did I go? Was the waking up in the waiting-room,
  and all those women, and the funny little old
  porter&mdash;<i>real</i>? Of course they were, or I should not be
  on the train...</p>

  <p>"But I met Miss Froy <i>afterwards</i>. They say she's only my
  dream. So, if she's a dream, it means that I've dreamed the
  waiting-room and the train and that I'm not on the train at all.
  I'm not awake yet...If it was true, it would be enough to drive
  any one mad."</p>

  <p>She resolutely fought back the rising tide of hysteria.</p>

  <p>"But it's absurd. I am awake and I'm here in this train. So I
  <i>did</i> meet Miss Froy...Only I'm up against some mystery and
  I have to fight a pack of lies. All right, then, I
  <i>will</i>."</p>

  <p>At this stage her concern was for herself, rather than for
  Miss Froy. She had been spoiled since her birth, so it was
  natural for her to be selfish; and because that self was a gay
  and charming entity, the world had united to keep her fixed at
  her special angle.</p>

  <p>But now her ego was getting involved with the fate of an
  obscure and unattractive spinster. Once again she began to review
  the incidents of their meeting. And then, suddenly, her clouded
  brain cleared and a sealed cell in her memory became
  unblocked.</p>

  <p>The baroness looked at her as she sprang from her seat. "Is
  madame worse?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Better, thanks," replied Iris. "And I'm going to test some
  English memories, just for a change. I'm going to talk to some
  English visitors from my hotel who saw me with Miss Froy."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; FRESH EVIDENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOW that she was about to establish Miss Froy's
  existence, Iris began to wonder what had become of her. When she
  remembered her exhaustive search of the train it seemed positive
  that she could not be there. But it was also impossible for her
  to be anywhere else.</p>

  <p>The corridors and carriages were thronged with tourists, so
  that she could not open a door or window to jump out, without
  attracting immediate attention. It was equally certain that no
  one could make a parcel of her and dump her on the permanent way,
  without becoming an object of general interest.</p>

  <p>There was no place for her to hide&mdash;nor could Iris
  conceive any motive for such a course. In short, she was
  protected from any form of injury&mdash;accidental or
  intentional&mdash;by the presence of a cloud of witnesses.</p>

  <p>In despair Iris shelved the problem.</p>

  <p>"She can't be proved missing until it's proved that she was
  there in the first place," she argued. "That's my job. After
  that, the others must carry on."</p>

  <p>As she remembered the professor's standard for reliable
  evidence she felt she could understand a showman's pride in his
  exhibits. Her witnesses must satisfy the most exacting
  taste&mdash;being British to the core.</p>

  <p>The baroness looked at her when she opened her bag and drew
  out her pocket-mirror and lipstick. Although her detachment was
  complete and her face void of expression, she somehow conveyed an
  impression of secret activity, as though she were spinning mental
  threads.</p>

  <p>"She's pitting her brain against mine," thought Iris, in a
  sudden flurry. "I must get in first."</p>

  <p>Directly she began to hurry she went to pieces again. Her
  hands shook so that she painted her mouth with a streak of vivid
  red&mdash;more suggestive of crushed fruit than the crimson
  blossom after which the tint was named. Unable to find her comb
  she gave up the attempt and dashed out into the corridor.</p>

  <p>Men stared at her and women muttered complaints as she pushed
  them aside without apology. As a matter of fact she was hardly
  conscious of them, except as so many obstacles in her way. After
  so much delay, every wasted moment was a personal reproach. In
  her excitement she could only see&mdash;a long way off&mdash;the
  blurred figure of a little spinster.</p>

  <p>She must hurry to reach it. But faces kept coming in between
  her and her goal&mdash;faces that grinned or scowled&mdash;the
  faces of strangers. They melted away like a mist, only to give
  place to other faces. There was a flash of eyes and teeth&mdash;a
  jam of bodies. She thrust and struggled, while her cheeks burned
  and a wave of hair fell across her cheeks.</p>

  <p>When at last she won through to the clearer stretch of
  corridor, the sight of the professor&mdash;smoking, while he
  looked through the window&mdash;reminded her of the conventions.
  She felt ashamed of her haste and she spoke breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like a jigsaw? It was that devastating crowd. They
  wouldn't let me through."</p>

  <p>The professor did not smile, for in spite of a picturesque
  attraction, her wild hair and brilliant colour produced a wanton
  effect which did not appeal to him. Neither did Mr. Todhunter
  approve her, as he criticised her through the open door of his
  coupé.</p>

  <p>Although he claimed to be a judge of feminine charm, he was of
  the type that prefers a lily-pond to a waterfall. He never
  lingered before an unframed picture, for he exacted the correct
  setting for beauty. Abandon was only permissible in a negligée
  and definitely bad form on a train journey. Although he had often
  seen Iris, when she looked like a member of an undress beauty
  chorus, he had never noticed her until the evening when she wore
  a becoming frock.</p>

  <p>"Who's the girl?" asked the bride as she flicked over the
  pages of a pictorial paper.</p>

  <p>He lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"One of the mob from the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Help."</p>

  <p>In the next coupé Miss Rose Flood-Porter raised her head from
  the soft leather cushion without which she never travelled. Her
  movement roused her sister from her doze, and she, too, strained
  to listen.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of her audience Iris spoke to the professor in a
  high excited voice.</p>

  <p>"Your marvellous witnesses have let you down. They were all
  telling lies. The six of them."</p>

  <p>He looked at her burning cheeks with cold concern.</p>

  <p>"Is your head worse?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I'm perfectly fit...And I can prove Miss Froy was
  with me, because the English visitors from my hotel saw her, too.
  We'll get in touch with the English Consul when we reach Trieste
  and he'll hold up the train for a thorough examination. Oh,
  you'll see."</p>

  <p>Iris thrilled at the prospect of her triumph. At that moment
  she seemed to see the Union Jack fluttering overhead and hear the
  strains of the National Anthem.</p>

  <p>The professor smiled with dreary patience.</p>

  <p>"I'm waiting to be convinced," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Then you shall be." Iris swung round to find herself facing
  Mr. Todhunter. "You'll help me find Miss Froy, won't you?" she
  asked confidently.</p>

  <p>He smiled down indulgently at her but he did not reply at
  once. It was the pause of deliberation and was characteristic of
  his profession.</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted to co-operate with you," he told her.
  "But&mdash;who is Miss Froy?"</p>

  <p>"An English governess who is missing from the train. You must
  remember her. She peeped in at your window and you jumped up and
  drew down the blind."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I should have done in the circumstances.
  Only, in this case, the special circumstances did not arise. No
  lady did me the honour to linger by my window."</p>

  <p>His words were so unexpected that Iris caught her breath, as
  though she were falling through space.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you <i>see</i> her?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But your wife called your attention to her. You were both
  annoyed."</p>

  <p>The beautiful Mrs. Todhunter, who had been listening, broke in
  with none of her habitual languor.</p>

  <p>"We are not a peep-show and no one looked in...Do you mind if
  we shut the door? I want to rest before dinner."</p>

  <p>The professor turned to Iris with forced kindness.</p>

  <p>"You're tired," he said. "Let me take you back to your
  carriage."</p>

  <p>"No." Iris shook off his hand. "I won't let the matter rest.
  There are others. These ladies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dashing into the next coupé where the Misses Flood-Porter now
  sat upright in dignity, she appealed to them.</p>

  <p>"You'll help me find Miss Froy, won't you? She's
  <i>English</i>."</p>

  <p>"May I explain?" interposed the professor as the ladies looked
  to him for enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Iris could hardly control her impatience as she listened to
  the cultured drawl. Her eyes were fixed on the solid fresh faces
  of the sisters. Then Miss Rose spoke.</p>

  <p>"I have no recollection of your companion. Some one may have
  been with you, but I was not wearing my glasses."</p>

  <p>"Neither was I," remarked Miss Flood-Porter. "So you can
  understand that we shall not be able to help you. It would be
  against our principles to identify some one of whom we were not
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Most unfair," commented Miss Rose. "So, please, don't refer
  to us. If you do, we must refuse to interfere."</p>

  <p>Iris could hardly believe her ears.</p>

  <p>"But isn't it against your principles not to raise a finger to
  help an Englishwoman who may be in danger?" she asked hotly.</p>

  <p>"Danger?" echoed Miss Rose derisively. "What could happen to
  her on a crowded train? Besides, there are plenty of other people
  who are probably more observant than ourselves. After all, there
  is no reason why we should be penalised because we are
  English."</p>

  <p>Iris was too bewildered by the unexpected collapse of her
  hopes, to speak. She felt she had been betrayed by her
  compatriots. They might boast of wearing evening dress for the
  honour of their country, but they had let down England. The Union
  Jack lay shredded in tatters and the triumphant strains of the
  National Anthem died down to the screech of a tin whistle.</p>

  <p>She hated them all so fiercely that when the vicar's wife put
  her head round the door she could only glare at her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes gave a general smile as she explained her
  presence.</p>

  <p>"My husband is sleeping now, so I thought I'd run in for a
  chat. When we travel, I'm first in command, which is a new
  experience for me and only comes once a year."</p>

  <p>She spoke eagerly as though to justify her husband's weakness.
  Then she turned to Iris, who was following the professor from the
  coupé.</p>

  <p>"Don't let me drive you away."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could keep me." Iris spoke with bitter hopelessness.
  "Of course, you didn't see Miss Froy?"</p>

  <p>"Was that the little lady in tweed, with a blue feather in her
  hat?" asked Mrs. Barnes. "Why, <i>of course,</i> I remember her,
  and her kindness. We were so grateful for the tea."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">XV. &mdash; TRANSFORMATION
  SCENE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HER relief was so overwhelming that Iris felt on
  the verge of tears as she turned to the professor. "Are you
  convinced now?" she asked shakily.</p>

  <p>The professor glanced at the vicar's wife with almost an
  apologetic air, for the lady was a familiar type which he admired
  and approved, when it was safely married to some one else.</p>

  <p>"The question is unnecessary," he said. "It was simply a
  matter of getting corroborative evidence. I'm sorry to have
  doubted your word in the first place. It was due to the
  unfortunate circumstances of your sunstroke."</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do?" insisted Iris.</p>

  <p>Having made one blunder, the professor was not inclined to be
  precipitate.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better consult Hare," he said. "He is an expert
  linguist and has quite a fair brain, although he may appear
  irresponsible at times."</p>

  <p>"Let's find him at once," urged Iris.</p>

  <p>In spite of her haste she stopped to speak impulsively to the
  vicar's wife.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so very much. You don't know what this means to
  me."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad&mdash;but why are you thanking me?" asked Mrs.
  Barnes, in surprise.</p>

  <p>Leaving Miss Rose to explain Iris followed the professor. Hare
  was frankly incredulous when they ran him to earth in the
  restaurant car.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul," he explained, "Miss Froy popping up again?
  There's something about that good woman that keeps me guessing. I
  don't mind admitting that I never really believed in the old
  dear. But what's happened to her?"</p>

  <p>The professor took off his glasses to polish them. Without
  them his eyes appeared weak, rather than cold, while the painful
  red ridges on either side of his nose aroused Iris' compassion.
  She felt quite friendly towards him, now that they were united in
  a common cause&mdash;the restitution of Miss Froy.</p>

  <p>"The Misses Flood-Porter didn't want to be drawn in," she
  declared. "That was clear. But why did those six foreigners all
  tell lies about her?"</p>

  <p>"It must be some misunderstanding," said the professor
  nervously. "Perhaps I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't," cut in Hare. "You were a clinking
  interpreter, professor. You didn't slip up on a thing."</p>

  <p>Iris liked him for the ready good nature which prompted him to
  reassure the professor because she was sure that he considered
  him privately a pompous bore.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to play the good old game of 'Spot the lady,'"
  went on Hare "My own idea is, she's disguised as the doctor. That
  black beard is so obvious that she's making it too easy...Or she
  may be pulling the train, dressed up as a ladylike engine. I'd
  put nothing past Miss Froy."</p>

  <p>Iris did not laugh.</p>

  <p>"You're not amusing," she said, "because you seem to forget
  that, besides being a real person, she is still missing. We must
  <i>do</i> something."</p>

  <p>"Admittedly," agreed the professor. "But it's a perplexing
  problem, and I do not care to act without careful
  consideration."</p>

  <p>"He means he wants to smoke," explained Hare. "All right,
  professor. I'll take care of Miss Carr, while you squeeze out
  some brain juice."</p>

  <p>He grinned across the ash-dusted table at Iris, when the
  professor had gone.</p>

  <p>"Have I got it right?" he asked. "Is this Miss Froy a complete
  stranger to you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"Yet you're nearly going crackers over her. You must be the
  most unselfish person alive. Really, it's almost unnatural."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not," admitted Iris truthfully. "It's rather the
  other way round. That's the amusing part. I can't understand
  myself a bit."</p>

  <p>"Well, how did it start?"</p>

  <p>"In the usual way. She was very kind to me&mdash;helpful, and
  all that, so that at first, I missed her because she wasn't at
  the back of me any more. And then, when every one declared I
  dreamed her, it all turned to a horrible nightmare. It was like
  trying to explain that every one was out of step but myself."</p>

  <p>"Hopeless. But why had you to prove that she was there?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, can't you understand? If I didn't, I could never feel
  that anything, or any one, was <i>real</i> again?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't fly off the handle," remarked Hare stolidly. "I
  should know it was a post-symptom of brain injury, and therefore
  perfectly logical."</p>

  <p>"But you can't compare your own experience with mine,"
  protested Iris. "You saw a real person and mistook him for the
  Prince. But I was supposed to have talked to the thin air, while
  the thin air answered back...I can't tell you what a
  <i>relief</i> it was when Mrs. Barnes remembered her."</p>

  <p>She smiled with happiness as she looked out of the window. Now
  that she was safely anchored to a rational world again, after
  spinning amid mists of fantasy, the gloomy surroundings had no
  power to depress her. The afternoon had drawn in early, so that
  the period of twilight was protracted and it added the final
  touch of melancholy to the small town through which the express
  was slowly steaming.</p>

  <p>Whenever they crossed a street, Iris could see mean shops,
  with pitifully shrunken wares&mdash;cobbled roads&mdash;and
  glimpses of a soupy swollen river through the gaps between the
  buildings. The houses&mdash;clinging to the rocky hillside, like
  tufts of lichen on a roof&mdash;seemed semi-obliterated by time
  and weather. Long ago, wood and plaster had been painted grey,
  but the rain had washed and the sun had peeled some of the walls
  to a dirty white. Every aspect betrayed poverty and
  desolation.</p>

  <p>"What a horrible place," shuddered Iris, as they passed tall
  rusty iron gates which enclosed a dock-grown garden. "I wonder
  who can live here, besides suicides."</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy," suggested Hare.</p>

  <p>He expected an outburst, but Iris was not listening to
  him.</p>

  <p>"When do we reach Trieste?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two-ten."</p>

  <p>"And it's five to six now. We mustn't waste any more time. We
  <i>must</i> find her...It sounds exactly like some sloppy
  picture, but her people are expecting her home. They're old and
  rather pathetic. And the fool of a dog meets every train."</p>

  <p>She stopped&mdash;aghast at the sound of her choked voice. To
  her surprise she found that she was actually affected by the
  thought of the parents' suspense. As emotion was treason to the
  tradition of the crowd, she felt ashamed of her weakness.</p>

  <p>"I'll have that drink, after all," she declared, blinking the
  moisture from her eyes. "I feel all mushy&mdash;and that's
  absurd. Old people aren't nearly as pathetic as young ones.
  They're nearly through&mdash;and we've got it all to come."</p>

  <p>"You do want a drink," agreed Hare. "I'll dig out a
  waiter."</p>

  <p>As he was rising Iris pulled him back.</p>

  <p>"Don't go now," she whispered. "There's that horrible
  doctor."</p>

  <p>The spade-bearded gentleman seemed to be searching for some
  one; and directly his glasses flashed over the young couple his
  quest was finished. He crossed directly to their table and bowed
  to Iris.</p>

  <p>"Your friend has returned to the carriage," he said.</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy?" Iris forgot her repulsion in her excitement. "How
  marvellous. Where was she?"</p>

  <p>He spread his hands and shrugged.</p>

  <p>"All the time she was so near. In the next carriage, talking
  with my nurses."</p>

  <p>"Yes," declared Iris, laughing, "that's just where she would
  be. The first place I ought to have looked in, and didn't."</p>

  <p>"Hum." Hare rubbed his chin doubtfully. "It's all very rum.
  Sure it's the right one?"</p>

  <p>"She is the lady who accompanied madame to the restaurant-
  car," replied the doctor. "A little short lady&mdash;not young,
  but not very old, with a blue feather in her hat."</p>

  <p>"That's Miss Froy," cried Iris.</p>

  <p>"But why was there all the mystery?" persisted Hare. "No one
  knowing a thing about her&mdash;and all that."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that was because we did not understand madame."</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged deprecatingly. "She talked so fast and she
  talked of an English lady. Now the lady is German, may be, or
  Austrian&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but she is not English."</p>

  <p>Iris nodded to Hare.</p>

  <p>"I made the same mistake, myself, at first," she told him.
  "She looks anything and she speaks every language. Come on and
  you shall check up on her."</p>

  <p>The journey along the train was growing so familiar that Iris
  felt she could make it blindfolded. As she passed by the Barnes'
  compartment she peeped inside. The vicar looked grimly heroic,
  with folded arms and knotted brow, while his wife showed visible
  signs of strain. Her eyes were sunken in black circles, but she
  smiled bravely at Iris.</p>

  <p>"Still looking for your friend?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," called Iris. "She's found."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank God."</p>

  <p>"I didn't like that holy woman," Iris confided to Hare as they
  struggled on again, "but her stock has simply soared with me.
  She's really kind."</p>

  <p>When they reached the reserved coupés, Iris insisted on
  collecting the professor, to whom she told her news.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come, too, and meet my Miss Froy," she said.
  "She'll be thrilled when she hears of the sensation she's
  made."</p>

  <p>"A desire to attract attention seems a feminine
  characteristic," observed the professor acidly.</p>

  <p>Iris only laughed with excitement as her heart gave a sudden
  bound.</p>

  <p>"There she is," she cried. "There she is, at the end of the
  corridor."</p>

  <p>Once again she was overwhelmed by the derided human element as
  she saw the familiar flat figure in the light tweed suit.</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy," she cried huskily.</p>

  <p>The lady turned so that Iris saw her face. At the sight she
  recoiled with a cry of horror.</p>

  <p>"That's not Miss Froy," she said.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; STAR WITNESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS Iris stared at the face of a stranger, she
  was plunged back into the inky darkness of the tunnel. She
  believed that she had emerged into the daylight and her heart was
  still singing for the joy of deliverance. But she had been
  deceived by a ray of sunshine striking through a shaft in the
  roof.</p>

  <p>The horror persisted. Blackness was behind her and
  before&mdash;deadening her faculties and confusing her senses.
  She felt that she was trapped in a nightmare which would go on
  for ever, unless she could struggle free.</p>

  <p>Miss Froy. She must hold on to Miss Froy. At that moment she
  suddenly remembered her elusive face distinctly in its strange
  mixture of maturity and arrested youth, with blue saucer eyes and
  small features all scratched and faded faintly by time.</p>

  <p>An impostor stood before her, wearing Miss Froy's oatmeal
  tweed suit. The face under the familiar hat was sallow&mdash;the
  black eyes expressionless. It looked wooden, as though it could
  not weep, and had never smiled.</p>

  <p>Breaking out of her nightmare, Iris challenged her.</p>

  <p>"You are not Miss Froy."</p>

  <p>"No," replied the woman in English, "I have not heard that
  name ever before. I am Frau Kummer, as I told you, when we had
  our tea together."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie. I never had tea with you. You're a complete
  stranger to me."</p>

  <p>"A stranger, certainly, such as one meets on a journey. But we
  talked together. Only a little because your poor head ached."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>The significance of the doctor's exclamation was deliberately
  stressed. It made Iris quiver with apprehension, even while it
  put her on her guard.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't let them get me down," she thought. Then she turned
  desperately to the professor.</p>

  <p>"This is not Miss Froy," she said vehemently.</p>

  <p>"The lady has told us that herself," remarked the professor
  impatiently. "In fact, with the exception of yourself, no one
  appears to have heard the somewhat uncommon name of 'Froy.'"</p>

  <p>It was obvious that he believed that Miss Froy lived at the
  sign of The Unicorn, in the congenial company of Mrs. Harris and
  the Spanish prisoner.</p>

  <p>"But she's wearing her clothes," persisted Iris, trying to
  keep her voice from quivering. "Why? <i>Why?</i> What's become of
  Miss Froy? It's some conspiracy&mdash;and I'm afraid...She says
  we had tea together, but we didn't. The waiter knows. Send for
  him."</p>

  <p>To her dismay Hare did not bound off on his mission like a
  Hermes in nailed boots. Instead, he twisted his lip and looked
  sheepish.</p>

  <p>"Why not call it a day and get some rest?" he suggested in the
  soothing tone which infuriated Iris.</p>

  <p>No one believed her&mdash;and the combined force of their
  incredulity made her doubt herself. The darkness seemed to be
  closing round her again when she remembered her supporting
  witness&mdash;the vicar's wife.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Barnes," she said faintly.</p>

  <p>"I'll fetch her," offered the professor, who was anxious to
  put an end to the scene.</p>

  <p>Although he was kind-hearted and eminently just&mdash;when he
  knew his bearings&mdash;he was prejudiced against Iris, because
  of an unfortunate incident which marred the close of his last
  term. One of his most brilliant pupils&mdash;a plain, sedate
  young person, about whose progress he had been almost
  enthusiastic&mdash;had suddenly gone back on him and involved him
  in a very unpleasant emotional scene.</p>

  <p>When she came to his study to wish him good-bye, she had
  broken down completely, assuring him that she had worked solely
  to please him, and that she could not face the thought of their
  parting.</p>

  <p>As he had insisted on keeping the door open, from motives of
  prudence, a version of the affair had been put into circulation,
  to his intense annoyance. Therefore he cursed his luck in being
  involved with another hysterical girl, as he passed the coupé
  occupied by the Misses Flood-Porter.</p>

  <p>Through the glass he could see Mrs. Barnes, who had returned
  to finish her interrupted chat, so he entered.</p>

  <p>"More trouble for you, I'm afraid," he warned her. "That very
  emotional young lady now wants you to identify some one. I wonder
  if you would mind coming with me to her compartment?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Edna Barnes. "Is it the kind little lady in
  parchment tweed, speckled with brown and a blue feather in her
  hat?"</p>

  <p>"Presumably. I seem to recollect the feather." The professor
  looked down at her strained brown eyes and added kindly. "You
  look very pale. Not ill, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no." Mrs. Barnes' voice was extra cheerful. "It's my
  husband who is ill. But I'm bearing his pain for him, so that he
  can sleep."</p>

  <p>"Absent treatment?"</p>

  <p>"Something of the kind, perhaps. When you're married&mdash;if
  there is a real bond&mdash;you share more than an income."</p>

  <p>"Well, I call it silly," broke in Miss Rose. "He's far
  stronger than you are."</p>

  <p>The professor, however, looked at her sweet face with
  additional respect.</p>

  <p>"I don't like to worry you with this matter," he said. "In my
  opinion, the girl is hysterical and wants to be in the limelight.
  She says now that the lady is not the original one, who,
  according to her&mdash;is still missing."</p>

  <p>"We'll hope she is the right one, for your sake," remarked
  Miss Flood-Porter placidly. "If not, she'll keep you hanging
  about at Trieste, and you'll miss your connection to Milan."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes pressed her hand over her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hope not," she cried. "My husband wants to get this
  wretched journey over. Still, one has to do one's
  duty&mdash;whatever the cost."</p>

  <p>"But it's so futile," declared Miss Rose. "From your
  description, this missing governess is no chicken and an
  experienced traveller. She's either lying low and has given the
  girl the slip for some good reason of her own, or else it's all
  moonshine."</p>

  <p>"Indubitably the latter," remarked the professor, as he
  accompanied Mrs. Barnes out into the corridor.</p>

  <p>Here they met the vicar who had come in search of his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"This <i>is</i> my husband," cried Mrs. Barnes, her face
  lighting up. "Did you think I'd deserted you, Ken?"</p>

  <p>While they lingered to chat, Iris sat awaiting the return of
  Hare with the waiter. She had no real hope of the issue, since
  she had begun to regard all the officials as being tools of the
  baroness. A mysterious power was operating on a wholesale scale,
  to her own confusion. In proof of this, opposite to her was the
  horrible changeling who wore Miss Froy's clothing. Yet the
  incident was inexplicable, since she could find no motive for
  such a clumsy subterfuge.</p>

  <p>Every detail of the woman's figure corresponded so exactly
  with her recollection of Miss Froy, as she stared at the familiar
  blue bone buttons, that the first real doubt began to sap her
  confidence. She asked herself whether she were, in reality, the
  victim of some hallucination. Hare's story about the prince
  proved that it was no uncommon experience.</p>

  <p>She was feeling so limp that it seemed almost the easiest way
  out of her troubles. After all, she would have her work cut out
  to fight the constant threat of overhanging illness, without the
  additional worry of a problematical Miss Froy.</p>

  <p>"I shall soon know," she thought, as Hare returned with a
  waiter in tow.</p>

  <p>"You said the chap with the fair hair," he said to Iris. "I've
  bagged the only blond in the whole collection. By the way, he is
  proud of speaking English."</p>

  <p>Iris remembered the youth directly she saw the straw-coloured
  plastered hair and slanting forehead. He wore glasses, and looked
  more like a student or clerk.</p>

  <p>"Do you really understand English?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, madame," he replied eagerly. "I have my
  certificates, both for grammar and the conversational test."</p>

  <p>"Well, do you remember waiting on me at tea? Have you a
  reliable memory for faces?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame."</p>

  <p>"Then I want you to look at this lady&mdash;" Iris pointed to
  Kummer and added, "Don't look at her clothes, but look at her
  face. Now tell me&mdash;is that the lady who was having tea with
  me?"</p>

  <p>The waiter hesitated slightly, while his pale eyes grew
  momentarily blank. Then he nodded with decision.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame."</p>

  <p>"You're <i>sure</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame, I am positive sure."</p>

  <p>As Iris made no comment, Hare tipped the youth and sent him
  away. Although the interview had corresponded with his own
  forecast, he felt acutely uncomfortable. He glanced uneasily at
  the baroness and the doctor, but their faces only registered
  enforced patience, as they waited for the end of the
  infliction.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a muffled cry rang out from the next carriage.
  Instantly, the doctor sprang up from his seat and hurried back to
  his patient.</p>

  <p>The sound was so unhuman and inarticulate, with its dulled yet
  frantic reiteration of "M-m-m-m," that Iris was reminded of some
  maimed animal, protesting against suffering it could not
  understand. She had forgotten about the poor broken
  body&mdash;trussed and helpless in the next carriage&mdash;lying
  in complete dependence on two callous women.</p>

  <p>The recollection caused all her latent distrust of the doctor
  to flare up again. She asked herself what awaited the patient at
  her journey's end? Did she guess that she was being hurried to
  some operation&mdash;doomed to failure, yet recommended solely as
  an experiment, to satisfy scientific curiosity?</p>

  <p>Iris had still sufficient sense to know that she was indulging
  in neurotic and morbid speculation, so she hurriedly smashed up
  the sequence of her thoughts. As a characteristic voice told her
  of the approach of the professor, she tilted her chin
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Barnes remembered Miss Froy when all the rest pretended
  to forget her," she said to Hare. "I know she couldn't tell a
  lie. So I don't care two hoots for all the rest. I'm banking on
  <i>her</i>."</p>

  <p>Edna Barnes advanced, her arm linked within that of her
  husband, as though for support. As a matter of fact, he was
  really leaning on her, for the shaking of the train made him feel
  rather giddy. Although still resolute, his face showed something
  of the strain of a knight approaching the end of his vigil.</p>

  <p>"I understand you want us to identify a friend of yours," he
  said to Iris, taking command of the situation as a matter of
  course.</p>

  <p>Then he looked down at his wife.</p>

  <p>"Edna, my dear," he asked, "is this the lady?"</p>

  <p>Unlike the waiter, Mrs. Barnes did not hesitate. Her
  recognition was instantaneous.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>The vicar came forward with outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of this opportunity to thank you for your
  kindness," he said.</p>

  <p>Miss Kummer stolidly accepted the tribute paid to Miss Froy.
  Or&mdash;was she really Miss Froy? Iris felt a frantic beating,
  as though of wings inside her head, as she slipped down into a
  roaring darkness.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; THERE WAS NO MISS
  FROY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE immediate effect of Iris' faint was to
  steady her nerves. When she recovered consciousness, to find
  someone forcing her head down below the level of her knees, she
  felt thoroughly ashamed of her weakness. There was not a trace of
  hysteria in her voice as she apologised.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to be such a crashing bore. I'm quite all right
  now."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you had better lie down?" asked Mr. Barnes.
  "I'm sure the Miss Flood-Porters would be only too glad to lend
  you their reserved compartment."</p>

  <p>Iris was by no means so sure that the ladies measured up to
  the vicar's own standard of charity; yet she felt a great need of
  some quiet place, where she could straighten out the tangle in
  her brain.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you," she said to Hare, leaving him to do
  the rest.</p>

  <p>As she anticipated, he jumped at the opportunity. "Sorry to
  eject you, professor," he said, "but our bunny-hutch is booked
  for the next half-hour."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," murmured the professor grimly.</p>

  <p>After swallowing some brandy from the vicar's flask, Iris
  staggered up from her seat. Her knees felt shaky and her temples
  were still cold; but the brief period of unconsciousness had
  relieved the pressure on her heart, so that she was actually
  better.</p>

  <p>As she and Hare&mdash;linked together, to the general
  inconvenience&mdash;lurched down the corridor, she noticed that
  the lights were now turned on. This arbitrary change from day to
  night, seemed to mark a distinct stage in the journey. Time was
  speeding up with the train. The rushing landscape was dark as a
  blurred charcoal-drawing, while a sprinkle of lights showed that
  they had reached a civilised zone, of which the wretched little
  town was the first outpost.</p>

  <p>Now that the outside world was shut out, the express seemed
  hotter and smokier. At first the confined space of the coupé
  affected Iris with a sense of claustrophobia.</p>

  <p>"Open the window wide," she gasped.</p>

  <p>"There's plenty of air coming in through the top," grumbled
  Hare, as he obeyed. "You'll be so smothered in smuts that your
  own mother wouldn't know you."</p>

  <p>"I haven't one," said Iris, suddenly feeling very sorry for
  herself. "But I'm not here to be pathetic. There's something too
  real and serious at stake...I want to remind you of something you
  said this morning at the railway station. You were having an
  argument with the professor, and I overheard it. You said trial
  by jury was unfair, because it depended on the evidence of
  witnesses."</p>

  <p>"I did," said Hare. "And I stick to every word."</p>

  <p>"And then," went on Iris, "the professor talked about reliable
  evidence, and he compared two women. One was English and
  county&mdash;the sort that collect fir-cones and things when she
  goes for a walk. The other had bought her eyelashes and was
  dark."</p>

  <p>"I remember <i>her.</i> Pretty woman, like a juicy black
  cherry."</p>

  <p>"But the professor damned her...And that's exactly what has
  happened now. I'd damned as a tainted witness, while he is
  prejudiced in favour of all those British matrons and Sunday
  school teachers."</p>

  <p>"That's only because they're plain Janes, while you've quite a
  different face&mdash;and thank heaven for it."</p>

  <p>Hare's attempt to soothe Iris was a failure, for she flared
  up.</p>

  <p>"I hate my face. It's silly and it means nothing. Besides, why
  should I be judged on face value if it goes against me? It's not
  fair. You said it wasn't fair. You told the professor it would
  lead to a bloody mix-up...You can't blow hot and cold. Unless
  you're a weather-cock, you've simply got to stand by me."</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll stand by. What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>Iris laid her hot palms on the sticky old-gold plush seat and
  leaned forward, so that her eyes looked into his.</p>

  <p>"I say there <i>is</i> a Miss Froy," she told him. "You've got
  to believe me. But my head feels like a three-ring circus, and
  I've grown confused. Will you go over it with me, so that I can
  get it clear?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear your version," Hare told her.</p>

  <p>He smoked thoughtfully as she went over the story of her
  meeting with the alleged Miss Froy, up to the time of her
  disappearance.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got one definite fact," he told her. "What
  the&mdash;the lady told you about the big boss is right. I can
  make an accurate guess as to her employer. At this moment a
  certain noble Johnny is in the local limelight over charges of
  bribery, tampering with contracts, and funny little things like
  that. The latest is he's accused of bumping off the editor of the
  revolutionary rag which brought the charges."</p>

  <p>He picked up a flimsy yellow sheet of badly printed
  newspaper.</p>

  <p>"It's in the stop press," he explained, "but as he was at his
  hunting-lodge at the time, the final sensation's squashed.
  However, nobody will bother. It's quite true about the feudal
  system being in force in these remote districts."</p>

  <p>"But it proves me right," cried Iris in great excitement. "How
  could I know all about her employer, unless Miss Froy told me?
  And there's something else. When I told Miss Froy about my
  sunstroke the baroness was listening. She couldn't know about it
  in any other way. So Miss Froy was there in the carriage with
  me."</p>

  <p>She looked so radiant that Hare hated to crush her
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he said, "that it only proves that Miss Kummer
  was there. She told you about her employer, and perhaps a spot of
  family history when you were having tea with her. Later on, you
  mentioned your sunstroke to her...If you remember, when you came
  on the train, directly after your sunstroke, you were under the
  impression that all the other passengers were foreigners. Then
  you dozed and woke up all confused, and suddenly, Miss Froy, an
  Englishwoman, comes to life."</p>

  <p>"But she had blue eyes and giggled like a schoolgirl,"
  protested Iris. "Besides, there were her old parents and the dog.
  I couldn't have made them up."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Don't you ever dream?"</p>

  <p>Dejectedly, Iris conceded the point.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Yes, you must be right."</p>

  <p>"I must remind you," continued Hare, "that Kummer was
  positively identified by the parson as the lady who sent them
  their tea. Now, I'm the last person to be biased, because all my
  uncles and fathers are parsons, and I've met them at
  breakfast&mdash;but the church does imply a definite standard. We
  insist on parsons having a higher moral code than our own and we
  try them pretty hard; but you must admit they don't often let us
  down."</p>

  <p>"No," murmured Iris.</p>

  <p>"Besides that parson has such a clinking face. Like God's good
  man."</p>

  <p>"But he never saw Miss Froy," Iris reminded him. "He was
  speaking for his wife."</p>

  <p>Hare burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"You have me there," he said. "Well, that shows how we can
  slip up. He took the stage so naturally, that he got us all
  thinking he was the witness."</p>

  <p>"If you're wrong over one thing, you can be wrong over
  another," suggested Iris hopefully.</p>

  <p>"True. Let's go into it again. You suggest that the baroness
  got rid of Miss Froy&mdash;never mind how&mdash;and that the
  other passengers, being local people and in awe of the family,
  would back her up. So far, you are right. They would."</p>

  <p>"Only it seems such a clumsy plot," said Iris. "Dressing up
  some one quite different and passing her off as Miss Froy."</p>

  <p>"But that bit was an eleventh hour twist," explained Hare.
  "Remember, you upset their apple-cart, barging in at the last
  minute. When you made a fuss about Miss Froy, they denied her
  existence, at first. You were just a despised foreigner, so they
  thought they could get away with it. But when you said that other
  English people had seen her, they had to produce some
  one&mdash;and trust to luck that your friends had never heard of
  Pelman."</p>

  <p>He was talking of Miss Froy as though he took her existence
  for granted. It was such a novelty, that, in her relief, Iris'
  thoughts slipped off in another direction.</p>

  <p>"Can't you get that bit of hair to lie down?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "neither by kindness nor threats. It's my
  secret sorrow. Thank you. That's the first bit of interest you've
  shown in me."</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy is bringing us together, isn't she? You see, you
  believe in her too."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wouldn't go quite so far. But I promised to believe
  in you&mdash;false lashes and all&mdash;against the Flood-Porter
  Burberry. In that case, we must accept a plot, inspired by the
  all-highest, and carried out by his relative, the
  baroness&mdash;in connection with the doctor, to bump off Miss
  Froy...So, naturally, that wipes out all the native
  evidence&mdash;train-staff and all."</p>

  <p>"You are really rather marvellous," Iris told him.</p>

  <p>"Wait before you hand out bouquets. We pass on to that English
  crowd. The Misses Flood-Porter seem typical John Bulls. What are
  they like?"</p>

  <p>"They've been to the right school and know the best
  people."</p>

  <p>"Are they decent?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then they'd do the decent thing. I'm afraid that is one up
  against Miss Froy...Now we'll pass the honeymoon couple&mdash;who
  are presumably not normal&mdash;and come to the vicar's wife.
  What about her?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Remember, you're on oath, and I'm believing you."</p>

  <p>"Well,"&mdash;Iris hesitated&mdash;"I don't think she could
  tell a lie."</p>

  <p>"And I'm positive she wouldn't. I mix with publicans and
  sinners and know very little about saints. But, to me, she looks
  like a real good woman. Besides, she supported you the first
  time. That shows she has no axe to grind. She said Miss Kummer
  was the lady who accompanied you to tea. Don't you think we must
  believe her?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so...Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, the weight of evidence is against Miss Froy. But
  since I've declared my distrust of evidence&mdash;however
  convincing it may sound&mdash;I'm going to wash out the lot. To
  my mind, the whole point is&mdash;motive."</p>

  <p>Iris saw Miss Froy fading away as Hare went on with his
  inquisition.</p>

  <p>"I understand Miss Froy was quite small beer. Would she be
  mixed up in any plot?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Iris. "She was against the Red element."</p>

  <p>"And neither young nor pretty? So she wasn't kidnapped by the
  order of the high hat?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd."</p>

  <p>"Any enemies?"</p>

  <p>"No, she boasted of being friends with every one."</p>

  <p>"Hum. It's hardly a motive for murder, but was the family
  annoyed because she was going to teach in the opposition
  camp?"</p>

  <p>"No. She told me how her employer shook hands with her when he
  said 'Good-bye,' and thanked her for her services."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;is it clear to you now? Unless you can show me a
  real motive for a high life conspiracy against a poor but honest
  governess, I'm afraid there's an end of Miss Froy. Do you
  agree?"</p>

  <p>There was a long pause while Iris tried to battle against the
  current that was sweeping Miss Froy away. She told herself that
  so many people, with diverse interests, could not combine to lie.
  Besides, as Hare had said, what was the motive?</p>

  <p>It was useless to struggle any longer and she let herself be
  swung out with the tide.</p>

  <p>"You must be right," she said. "One can't go against
  <i>facts</i>...Yet, she was so real. And her old parents and the
  dog were real, too."</p>

  <p>She had the feeling that she had just slain something fresh
  and joyous&mdash;that fluttered and fought for life&mdash;as she
  added, "You've won. There is no Miss Froy."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THE SURPRISE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. FROY would have been furious had she known
  that any one doubted her reality.</p>

  <p>While Iris was sighing for the passing of a pleasant ghost,
  she was at home in the depths of the country, and entertaining
  friends in her drawing-room.</p>

  <p>It was a small room with diamond-paned windows&mdash;hung with
  creepers&mdash;which made it rather dark; but in spite of the
  shabby carpet, it was a gracious place, where odd period chairs
  fraternised with homely wickerwork, and a beautiful red lacquer
  cabinet lent the colour which the faded chintz could not
  supply.</p>

  <p>Pots of fine golden chrysanthemums, grown by Mr. Froy,
  screened the empty iron grate. The guests might have preferred a
  fire, for there was that slight chill&mdash;often associated with
  old country houses&mdash;suggestive of stone flags. Yet the sun
  could be seen, through the curtain of greenery, shining on the
  flower-beds outside; for, although the electric lamps were
  gleaming in the express, the daylight still lingered farther
  north.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy was short and stout, with grey hair and great
  dignity. In addition to having a dominant personality, to-day she
  felt extra full of vitality. It was born of her excitement at the
  thought that her daughter was actually on her way home.</p>

  <p>The postcard was on the marble mantel shelf, propped up
  against the massive presentation clock. On its back was printed a
  crudely coloured picture of mountains, with grass-green bases and
  white tops, posed against a brilliant blue sky. Scribbled across
  the heavens, in a round unformed handwriting, was the
  message.</p>

  <p>"Home Friday night. Isn't it topping?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy showed it to her guests.</p>

  <p>"Everything is 'topping' to my daughter," she explained with
  proud indulgence. "I'm afraid at one time it used to be
  'ripping.'"</p>

  <p>A visitor looked at the string of consonants printed at the
  base of the picture&mdash;shied at them&mdash;and
  compromised.</p>

  <p>"Is she <i>there</i>?" she asked, pointing to the line.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Mrs. Froy reeled off the name rapidly and aggressively.
  She did it to impress, for it was only the home-interpretation of
  Winnie's address. But, on her return, their daughter would give
  them the correct pronunciation, and put them through their paces
  while they tried to imitate her own ferocious gargling.</p>

  <p>Then the room would know more of the laughter on which it had
  thriven and grown gracious.</p>

  <p>"My daughter is a great traveller," went on Mrs. Froy. "Here
  is her latest photograph. Taken at Budapest."</p>

  <p>The portrait was not very revealing since it was expensive. It
  hinted at the lower half of a small vague face, and a hat which
  photographed very well.</p>

  <p>"She looks quite cosmopolitan with her eyes covered by her
  hat," remarked Mrs. Froy. "Now, this is the Russian one...This
  one was taken at Madrid, on her birthday...Here she is in
  Athens."</p>

  <p>The collection was chiefly a geographical trophy, for while
  Mrs. Froy was proud of the printing on the mounts, she secretly
  resented the middle-aged stranger, who&mdash;according to
  her&mdash;was not in the least like her daughter.</p>

  <p>She ended the parade by stretching to reach a faded portrait
  in a silver frame, which stood on a shelf. It was taken at
  Ilfracombe, and showed a young girl with a slim neck and a
  smiling face, framed by a mass of curling fair hair.</p>

  <p>"This is my favourite," she declared. "Now, this really is
  Winnie."</p>

  <p>It was the girl who had taught in Sunday school, giggled at
  churchwardens, and refused her father's curates, before she
  spread adventurous wings and fluttered away.</p>

  <p>But she always returned to the nest.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy looked again at the clock. She tried to picture
  Winnie in a grand continental express, which stamped proudly all
  over the map of Europe. The poor girl would have to endure two
  nights in the train, but she always vowed she loved the
  experience. Besides, she knew all the little dodges of an
  experienced traveller, to secure comfort.</p>

  <p>Although a gregarious soul, Mrs. Froy began to wonder when her
  guests would go. There had been a hospitable big tea round the
  dining-room table, with blackberry pie, and a guest had made a
  stain on the best tablecloth. Although she had guiltily pushed
  her plate over it, Mrs. Froy had seen it. And since every
  minute's delay in rubbing salt into the mark would make its
  removal more difficult, she had found it difficult to maintain
  the myopia of a hostess.</p>

  <p>Besides she wanted to watch the clock alone, and gloat over
  the fact that every minute was bringing Winnie's return
  nearer.</p>

  <p>Although her fingers were itching to remove the tablecloth,
  after she had escorted her visitors to the gate, she did not
  return immediately to the house. In front of her was the field
  where she gathered mushrooms every morning. It was vividly green,
  and the black shadows of the elms were growing longer as the sun
  dipped lower.</p>

  <p>It was rather melancholy and lonely, so that she thought of
  her husband.</p>

  <p>"I wish Theodore would come home."</p>

  <p>Apparently he heard her wish for he appeared suddenly at the
  far end of the meadow&mdash;his tall thin black figure striding
  over the grass, as though he were in competition with the elm-
  shadows.</p>

  <p>Around him capered a dog which had some connection with the
  breed of Old English sheepdog; but his original line had slipped
  and he was suppressed in the family tree. During a recent hot
  spell, his shaggy coat had been clipped, transforming him to a
  Walt Disney creation.</p>

  <p>Sock was the herald and toastmaster of the family. Directly he
  espied the little dumpy grey lady at the garden gate, he made a
  bee-line towards her and circled round her, barking excitedly to
  tell her that the master was coming home.</p>

  <p>Having done his duty at her end of the field, he tore back to
  Mr. Froy with the glad news that the mistress of the house was
  waiting for him. As he gradually drew them together, both his
  owners were laughing at his elephantine gambols.</p>

  <p>"It must be a great relief to the poor fellow, getting rid of
  that thatch," said Mr. Froy. "He evidently feels very cool and
  light now."</p>

  <p>"He probably imagines he is a fairy," remarked his wife. "Look
  at him floating through the air like a puff of thistledown."</p>

  <p>"The dear old fool...Won't Winsome laugh?"</p>

  <p>"Won't she?"</p>

  <p>In imagination, both heard the joyous girlish peal.</p>

  <p>"And won't she be thrilled with her room?" went on Mrs. Froy.
  "Theo, I've a confession. The carpet came when you were out...And
  I am only human."</p>

  <p>Mr. Froy hid his disappointment.</p>

  <p>"You mean, you've unpacked it?" he asked. "Well, my dear, I
  deserved it for running away with Sock, instead of staying and
  helping you to entertain your visitors."</p>

  <p>"Come upstairs and see it. It looks like moss."</p>

  <p>They had bought a new carpet for Winifred's bedroom, as a
  surprise for her return. It represented stringent personal
  economy, since with a rigid income, any extra purchase meant
  taking a bite out of the weekly budget.</p>

  <p>So he had cut down his allowance of tobacco, and she had given
  up her rare visits to the cinema. But now that the forty days
  were over, these good things would have been nothing but ashes
  and counterfoils.</p>

  <p>The carpet remained&mdash;a green art-square.</p>

  <p>When they reached the bedroom, Mr. Froy looked round him with
  proud satisfied eyes. It was a typical schoolgirl's bedroom, with
  primrose washed walls and sepia photogravures of Greuze's
  beauties&mdash;limpid-eyed and framed in dark stained oak. The
  modern note was there also in photographs of Conrad Veidt and
  Robert Montgomery, together with school groups and Winnie's
  hockey-stick.</p>

  <p>The faded yellow-rosebud cretonne curtains and bedspread were
  freshly washed and ironed; a cake of green soap was displayed on
  the washstand; and two green candles&mdash;never to be
  lit&mdash;were stuck into the glass candlesticks before the
  mirror of the toilet-table.</p>

  <p>"We've made it look very nice," said Mr. Froy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it's not finished yet."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy pointed to the narrow oak bed, where two lumps at
  the top and the bottom told of hot water bottles.</p>

  <p>"It won't be finished until there's something inside that
  bed," she said. "I can't believe that in two nights' time I shall
  be slipping in to kiss her 'Good-night.'"</p>

  <p>"Only the first night," advised Mr. Froy. "Remember our
  daughter is the modern girl. Her generation avoids
  sentiment."</p>

  <p>"Yes, for all her heart, Winnie is modern," agreed his wife.
  "That is why she gets on so well with every one&mdash;high and
  low. You may depend on it, that even on her journey, by now she
  has made some useful friends who may be helpful at a pinch. I
  expect she knows all the best people on the train. And by 'best'
  I mean it in every sense of the word...I wonder where she is at
  this moment."</p>

  <p>Well for Mrs. Froy that she did not know.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; THE HIDDEN
  HAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN THE PROFESSOR's opinion, the Misses Flood-
  Porter were representative of the best people. At home he had the
  reputation of being unsociable and self-sufficient; but directly
  he travelled he developed a distrust of unfamiliar contacts, and
  a timidity which sought instinctively the security of his own
  class.</p>

  <p>He wanted to hear his own accent reproduced by some
  one&mdash;however uncongenial&mdash;who had been to his college,
  or lunched at his club, or who knew a cousin of one of his
  acquaintances.</p>

  <p>As he smoked in the corridor after his banishment, he glanced
  rather wistfully at the compartment where the sisters sat. Miss
  Rose&mdash;although his senior&mdash;was sufficiently near his
  age to be a potential danger. But her face dispelled any fears of
  dormant hysteria. It was slightly underhung and the firm outline
  of her protruding lip and chin was reassuring.</p>

  <p>Although he recoiled automatically when the elder lady caught
  his eye and invited him to come in with a smiling gesture, he
  entered and sat down rather stiffly beside Miss Rose.</p>

  <p>"Are you being kept out of your reserved carriage by that
  girl?" asked Miss Rose bluntly.</p>

  <p>When the professor explained the situation both sisters were
  indignant.</p>

  <p>"Fainted?" Miss Rose's tone was incredulous. "She was laughing
  when she passed, arm in arm with that youth. It's all too
  mysterious for me. Only I sincerely hope she won't stir up a fuss
  and get us all hung up at Trieste, for nothing."</p>

  <p>"It's her dog," explained the elder sister in an aside.</p>

  <p>Miss Rose caught her lower lip between her teeth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's Scottie," she said defiantly. "I'll own up I'm not
  quite normal over him. But he's so devoted to me&mdash;and he
  pines. The only other person I can trust him to is the
  butler."</p>

  <p>"Strange," remarked the professor. "My own dog has a marked
  aversion to butlers. Particularly, to my uncle's."</p>

  <p>The social temperature rose several degrees, and Miss Rose
  grew confidential.</p>

  <p>"It's like this. Coles&mdash;our butler&mdash;is due to go on
  a cruise, directly I come back. It's a new experience for him and
  he is thrilled. If I'm overdue he will probably stay at home with
  Scottie, and, of course, I don't want him to lose his
  holiday...On the other hand, if he went, poor little Scottie
  would be frantic. He would feel he had lost every friend."</p>

  <p>"We have an excellent staff," supplemented Miss Flood Porter,
  "but, unfortunately, none of them likes animals."</p>

  <p>The professor's long face wrinkled up in a smile which made
  him resemble a benevolent horse.</p>

  <p>"I can enter into your feelings," he told them. "I confess
  that my own dog makes me lose my sense of proportion. I rarely go
  abroad, because I cannot take her with me owing to quarantine
  regulations. But this year a complete change seemed
  indicated."</p>

  <p>The sisters exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that strange?" declared Miss Flood-Porter. "That is
  exactly our own position."</p>

  <p>Miss Rose flinched and changed the subject quickly. "What's
  your dog?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sealyham. White."</p>

  <p>The professor was sitting bolt upright no longer. Introduced
  by butlers, and their friendship cemented by the common ownership
  of dogs, he felt he was in congenial company. So he relaxed to
  gossip.</p>

  <p>"A position of responsibility towards the extraordinary young
  lady seems to have been thrust upon me," he said. "She appears
  bent on making things very awkward for every one. I understand
  she was staying at the same hotel as you...What opinion did you
  form of her?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," said Miss Rose bluntly. "I'm prejudiced. So,
  perhaps, I shouldn't be fair."</p>

  <p>Her sister made the explanation.</p>

  <p>"We know nothing about <i>her,</i> but she was with a party of
  near-nudists, who drank all day and night, and were a complete
  nuisance. The noise was worse than a pneumatic road-drill. And we
  came so far especially to get perfect rest and quiet."</p>

  <p>The professor clicked.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand your feelings," he said. "The point
  is&mdash;did she strike you as hysterical?"</p>

  <p>"I only know there was a disgraceful scene on the lake
  yesterday. Two women screaming about a man. She was one."</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised," commented the professor. "At present she
  is either telling a pack of lies to get into the limelight, or
  she is suffering from slight delirium as a result of sunstroke.
  The latter is the charitable view. But it involves
  responsibility. After all, we are her compatriots."</p>

  <p>Miss Rose began to fidget. When she opened her case and drew
  out a cigarette, her fingers were not quite steady.</p>

  <p>"Suppose&mdash;she is telling the truth?" she asked. "It's not
  fair for us to leave the girl behind us at Trieste without any
  backing...I'm worried stiff not knowing <i>what</i> to do."</p>

  <p>Had Mrs. Froy been listening, she would have clapped her gouty
  old hands. At last Miss Rose's attitude was coming into line with
  her expectations. The best people would be looking after Winnie.
  So no harm could possibly come to her...But all the same, "Keep
  her safe&mdash;and bring her home to us."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the professor was proof against the power of
  prayer. He wrinkled up his face in a sceptical grimace.</p>

  <p>"Her story is too unfounded for me to credit it," he said.
  "But even if the vanished governess were not a myth, I cannot
  conceive any cause for anxiety on her behalf. Her disappearance
  must be voluntary, because if she had come to any harm, or met
  with an accident, it would have been notified at once by an eye-
  witness."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed Miss Flood-Porter. "The train is so crowded
  that if she knew the ropes, she could play 'hide and seek'
  indefinitely with the ticket-collector."</p>

  <p>"Therefore," summed up the professor, "if she <i>is</i>
  hiding, she must have some strong personal reason for such a
  course. My own feeling is never to interfere with private issues.
  It would be extremely tactless and inconsiderate of us to start a
  general search for her."</p>

  <p>Miss Rose drew deeply at her cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Then you don't think me definitely feeble to put Scottie's
  interests first?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I should consider that you were letting your dog down if you
  sacrificed him to such an absolutely preposterous issue," replied
  the professor.</p>

  <p>"That goes for me. Thank you, professor." Miss Rose examined
  her firm pink hands. "I'm smutty. I'd better wash."</p>

  <p>When she had lurched out into the corridor, Miss Flood-Porter
  spoke to the professor confidentially.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't mention it before my sister&mdash;she is so
  sensitive on the subject&mdash;but we've just been through a
  nerve-shattering experience. And I don't see that we did a
  pennorth of good...Am I boring you?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least."</p>

  <p>Miss Flood-Porter began her story of those events which played
  their part in shaping the conduct of the sisters, and
  so&mdash;indirectly&mdash;affected the destiny of a stranger.</p>

  <p>"We live in a very quiet neighbourhood, close to the
  cathedral. It was ruined for every one when a terrible person
  came to live there. A War profiteer&mdash;at least, I call them
  all that. One day, when he was scorching in his car&mdash;drunk,
  as usual&mdash;he knocked down a woman. We saw the accident, and
  our evidence got him six months' imprisonment, as it was a bad
  case."</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you on your public spirit."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we, too, were quite pleased with ourselves, until
  he came out. After that we were marked people. This
  man&mdash;aided by his two boys&mdash;persecuted us in every kind
  of way. Windows were smashed&mdash;flower beds
  raided&mdash;horrible things thrown over the garden
  walls&mdash;obscene messages chalked on the gates. We could never
  catch them in the act, although we appealed to the police and
  they had a special watch kept on the premises...After a time it
  got on our nerves. It did not matter where we were, or what we
  were doing, we were always listening for another crash. It
  affected my sister most, as she was terrified lest one of her pet
  animals might be the next victim. Luckily, before it came to
  that, the man left the town."</p>

  <p>Miss Flood-Porter stopped, overcome by the memories she had
  raised.</p>

  <p>It began on the morning when she went out into the garden, to
  find that her unique white delphiniums had been uprooted during
  the night.</p>

  <p>After that there was the ever-increasing tension&mdash;the
  constant annoyance&mdash;the cumulative pecuniary loss&mdash;the
  futility of repairs, when panes of glass were replaced, only to
  be smashed again. It was like standing at a cross-roads in windy
  weather and being buffeted by an invisible weather-cock, which
  whirled round again after it had struck its blow. There were
  flutters of apprehension whenever the fiendish boys scorched by
  them on their bicycles, grinning with impudent triumph. And the
  time came when their nerve was worn down, so that their
  imaginations raced away with them and they grew fearful of worse
  evils in store.</p>

  <p>It ended on the evening when Miss Flood-Porter found her
  sister Rose in tears. If the Rock of Gibraltar had suddenly
  shaken like a jelly, she could not have been more aghast.</p>

  <p>She looked up to meet the professor's sympathetic eye.</p>

  <p>"Can you blame us," she asked, "when I tell you that, after
  that, we made a vow never to interfere in anything
  again&mdash;unless it was a case of cruelty to animals or
  children?"</p>

  <p>As Iris passed the window, in token that he was free to return
  to his own compartment, the professor rose.</p>

  <p>"Tell your sister," he advised, "not to worry any more, but to
  get back to her dog as quickly as possible. No one is going to
  suffer in any way. In case of any further complications, you can
  trust me to take charge."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, when Miss Flood-Porter repeated the
  message, Miss Rose was greatly relieved.</p>

  <p>"Now I can go home to Scottie with a <i>clear</i> conscience,"
  she said. "Any one must have complete confidence in the
  professor."</p>

  <p>She forgot one important point. The professor was working on
  the basis that Miss Froy was a fiction of hysteria&mdash;while
  both the sisters had seen her in the flesh.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20">XX. &mdash; STRANGERS
  INTERVENE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER Miss Froy had shrivelled to a never-never,
  Iris was thrown back on herself again. When her first relief at
  shelving the riddle had passed, she grew worried by her own
  sensations. Her knees were shaky, while her head felt light and
  empty as a blown egg-shell.</p>

  <p>Miss Froy would have known that, in addition to the after
  effects of sunstroke, the girl was exhausted for lack of light
  nourishment. At this juncture she was a dead loss to Iris, for
  Hare&mdash;with the best intentions&mdash;could only offer
  stimulants.</p>

  <p>As she clung to the shaking rail, fighting off recurrent
  spells of giddiness, Iris told herself that she must forcibly
  hang out until she reached Basle.</p>

  <p>"It would be fatal if I collapsed," she thought fearfully.
  "Max is too young to be any good. Some busybody would push me out
  at the first station, and pack me off to the local hospital."</p>

  <p>And anything might happen to her there, as in Miss Froy's
  terrible story. Or did Miss Kummer tell it to her?</p>

  <p>It was an ordeal to stand, but although she had insisted on
  leaving Hare&mdash;when she found that both talking and listening
  had become a strain&mdash;she shrank from the thought of return
  to her own compartment. It was too near the doctor and too remote
  from her compatriots. At the far end of the corridor she felt
  bottled up in enemy territory.</p>

  <p>Besides&mdash;it was haunted by the ghost of a little tweed
  spinster, of whom it was not wise to think too long.</p>

  <p>The high-pitched conversation of the Misses Flood-
  Porter&mdash;audible through the open door&mdash;was a
  distraction.</p>

  <p>"I've written to Captain Parker, to meet us with his car at
  Victoria, to push us through the customs," said Miss Flood-
  Porter.</p>

  <p>"Hope he'll be there," fussed Miss Rose. "If he fails us, we
  may lose our connection. And I've written to cook that dinner is
  to be ready at seven-thirty to the dot."</p>

  <p>"What did you order?"</p>

  <p>"Not chicken. Definitely. It will be some time before I can
  endure one again. I said a nice cutlet of salmon and a small leg
  of lamb. Peas, if possible. If it is too late for them, French
  beans and marrow. I left the sweet to cook."</p>

  <p>"That sounds very good. I'm longing to eat a plain English
  dinner again."</p>

  <p>"So am I."</p>

  <p>There was a short pause before Miss Rose began to worry
  anew.</p>

  <p>"I do hope there'll be no muddle over our wagon-lits at
  Trieste."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear," cried her sister, "don't suggest such a thing.
  I couldn't face the idea of sitting bolt upright all night.
  Didn't you hear the manager telephone for them?"</p>

  <p>"I stood by him while he was doing it. Of course, I could not
  understand anything. But he assured me positively that they were
  being reserved for us."</p>

  <p>"Well, we must hope for the best...I've been looking through
  my engagement-book. It's the bishop's last garden party, the day
  after we get back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we <i>couldn't</i> miss that."</p>

  <p>Iris' half-smile was bitter as she listened to the
  characteristic chatter of two inexperienced women-travellers, who
  felt very far from their beaten track.</p>

  <p>"And I expected <i>them</i> to risk losing their reservations
  and spoiling their dinner," she thought. "What a hope."</p>

  <p>Once again she flattened herself against the window, as the
  flaxen-haired waiter came down the corridor. Miss Rose saw him
  pass for she bounded out after him.</p>

  <p>"Stop," she cried in her most imperious tone. "You speak
  English?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame."</p>

  <p>"Then get me some matches, please. Matches."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, madame."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he really understood her," thought Iris, who had
  grown sceptical of every one.</p>

  <p>Her doubts were unfounded, for after a brief interval the
  waiter returned with a box of matches. He used one to light Miss
  Rose's cigarette and handed her the remainder with a bow.</p>

  <p>"The engine-driver is fulfilling his obligations and the
  express will reach Trieste within the scheduled time," he
  informed Miss Rose, who remarked, "Oh, definitely good."</p>

  <p>He seemed anxious to oblige every one. When Iris in her turn
  called out to him, he wheeled round smartly as though eager for
  service.</p>

  <p>As he recognised her, however, a change came over his face.
  His smile faded, his eyes shifted, and he appeared to conquer an
  impulse to bolt.</p>

  <p>All the same he listened obediently as she gave her order.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to the dining-car for dinner?" she told him. "I
  want you to bring me something to my carriage&mdash;right at the
  end of the corridor. A cup of soup or Bovril, or Ovaltine.
  Nothing solid. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, madame."</p>

  <p>He bowed himself away. But he never brought the soup...</p>

  <p>Iris forgot her order directly she had given it. A stream of
  passengers had begun to file steadily past her, crushing her
  against the side of the corridor. Since every one was heading in
  the same direction, she glanced at her watch.</p>

  <p>The time told her that the first dinner was about to be
  served.</p>

  <p>"Only three hours now to Trieste," she thought
  gladly&mdash;goaded no longer by the thought of wasted
  minutes.</p>

  <p>Where she stood she was very much in the way of the
  procession, and&mdash;since the majority was hungry&mdash;she was
  resented as an obstacle. She met with ruthless treatment, but it
  was useless to fight her way out against the human current. When
  she made the attempt she was nearly knocked down, as some of the
  rougher element began to push.</p>

  <p>No one appeared to notice her plight as she tried to get out
  of the jam. The train was racing at top speed, and she was shaken
  and bruised as she gripped the rail. Terrified of being crushed,
  her palms were sticky and her heart leaped with panic.</p>

  <p>At last the pressure was relaxed and she breathed more freely,
  as she waited for the better-behaved passengers to pass.
  Presently a combination of strokes, dots and dashes, in black and
  white, told her that the family party&mdash;linked
  together&mdash;was on its way to dinner. Free from the
  restraining presence of the baroness, they talked and laughed,
  evidently in high spirits at the prospect of their meal.</p>

  <p>Although the parents were sufficiently big to inflict some
  merciless massage as they squeezed past her, Iris was glad to see
  them, for she argued that they must be in the tail of the
  procession. Then the blonde slipped by&mdash;cool as a dripping
  icicle&mdash;with unshatterable composure and without one ruffled
  hair.</p>

  <p>Although the corridor was practically clear, Iris still
  lingered, unable to face the prospect of being alone in the
  carriage with the baroness. To her relief, however, the personage
  herself came in sight, accompanied by the doctor. Sure of getting
  a seat in the dining-car&mdash;however late her
  entrance&mdash;she had waited for the mob to disperse.</p>

  <p>As her vast black figure surged past Iris, a simile floated
  into the girl's mind. An insect and a relentless foot.</p>

  <p>The doctor threw her a keen professional glance which noted
  each symptom of distress. With a formal bow he passed on his way,
  and she was able to bump and sway along the corridors, back to
  the empty carriage.</p>

  <p>She had barely seated herself, after an involuntary glance at
  Miss Froy's empty corner, when Hare hurried in.</p>

  <p>"Coming to first dinner?" he asked. "I warn you, the second
  one will be only the scrapings."</p>

  <p>"No," she told him, "the waiter's bringing me some soup here.
  I've been in a rough-house and I simply couldn't stand the
  heat."</p>

  <p>He looked at her as she wiped her damp brow.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, you look all in. Let me get you a spot. No?...Well,
  then, I've just had an intriguing experience. On my way here, a
  woman's trembling hand was laid on my sleeve and a woman's
  piteous voice whispered, 'Could you do something for me?' I
  turned and looked into the beautiful eyes of the vicar's wife.
  Needless to say, I pledged myself to the service of the
  distressed lady."</p>

  <p>"Did she want a hot water bottle for her husband?" asked
  Iris.</p>

  <p>"No, she wanted me to send a telegram for her directly we
  reached Trieste. But now comes the interesting bit. I'm not to
  let her husband know or suspect anything. After that, I can't
  hint at the message."</p>

  <p>"Who wants to know it?" asked Iris dully.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I see you really are flat. I won't worry you any more.
  Chin-chin."</p>

  <p>Hare left the compartment, only to pop his head again round
  the corner of the door.</p>

  <p>"There's the ugliest ministering angel I've ever seen in the
  next carriage," he told her. "But what I really came back for was
  this. Do you know who 'Gabriel' is?"</p>

  <p>"An archangel."</p>

  <p>"I see. You're definitely <i>not</i> in the know."</p>

  <p>As the time passed and no waiter appeared with her soup, Iris
  came to the conclusion that he was too rushed to remember her
  order. But she felt too limp to care. All that mattered was the
  crawling hands of her watch, which drew her imperceptibly nearer
  to Trieste.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the fair waiter possessed a heart of
  gold, together with a palm which twitched an instinctively as a
  divining-twig in the direction of a tip. He would have found time
  to rush in that cup of soup, whatever the demand on his resource.
  The only drawback was he knew nothing about the order.</p>

  <p>Like most of his fellow-countrymen, he had been made a good
  linguist by the method of interchange between families of
  different nationalities. As he was ambitious, he felt that one
  extra language might turn the scale in his favour, when he
  applied for a job. Accordingly, he learned English from his
  teacher, who had taught himself the language from a book of
  phonetic pronunciation.</p>

  <p>The waiter, who was an apt pupil, passed his school
  examination and was able to rattle off strings of English
  phrases, but the first time he heard the language spoken by a
  Briton, he was unable to understand it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately English tourists were rare and most of their
  conversation was limited to the needs of their meals. While his
  ear was growing accustomed, therefore, he managed to keep his job
  by bluff and by being a good guesser.</p>

  <p>Miss Rose's unlighted cigarette gave him the clue that she
  wanted matches. Moreover her voice was loud and she was
  brief.</p>

  <p>But in Iris, he met his Waterloo. Her low husky voice and
  unfamiliar words beat him completely. After his first nerve-
  racking experience, he could only fall back on the mechanical,
  "Yes, madame," and rush to take cover.</p>

  <p>Before the other passengers returned to the carriage, Iris had
  another visitor&mdash;the professor. He took off his glasses to
  polish them nervously, while he explained the nature of his
  mission.</p>

  <p>"Hare has been talking to me, and&mdash;frankly&mdash;he is
  worried about you. I don't want to alarm you. Of course, you are
  not ill&mdash;that is, not definitely ill&mdash;but we are
  wondering if you are fit to continue the journey alone."</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," cried Iris in a panic. "I'm perfectly fit.
  And I don't want any one to worry on my account."</p>

  <p>"Yet, if you should collapse later, it would be decidedly
  awkward for you and every one. I was discussing it with the
  doctor, just now, and he came to the rescue with an admirable
  suggestion."</p>

  <p>As he paused, Iris' heart began to flutter with apprehension,
  for she knew by instinct what the proposal would be.</p>

  <p>"The doctor," went on the professor, "is taking a patient to a
  hospital at Trieste, and he offers to see you safely placed in a
  recommended nursing-home for the night."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; LIES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the professor made his proposal, Iris saw the
  opening of the trap. But he had forgotten the bait: She was a
  free agent&mdash;and nothing could induce her to walk inside.</p>

  <p>"I will not go anywhere with that doctor," she said.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to discuss it."</p>

  <p>The professor seemed about to argue, so she decided that it
  was no time for politeness.</p>

  <p>"I can't pretend to be grateful for your interest," she told
  him. "I consider it interference."</p>

  <p>The professor stiffened at the last word.</p>

  <p>"I have not the slightest wish to be intrusive," he said. "But
  Hare was genuinely concerned about you, and he asked me to use my
  influence."</p>

  <p>"No one can influence me to go with that horrible doctor."</p>

  <p>"In that case there is no more to be said."</p>

  <p>The professor was only too thankful to be rid of his
  responsibility. Since the girl was bent on antagonising those who
  held out a helping hand, there would be time for a smoke, while
  he waited for the second dinner.</p>

  <p>Iris did not like the professor's face, but his Harris-tweed
  back was British and reassuring. She realised with a pang that
  she was sending it away.</p>

  <p>Acting on impulse she called him back.</p>

  <p>"I won't go with that doctor," she said. "He's like death,
  but&mdash;supposing I <i>should</i> flop&mdash;which is
  absurd&mdash;I'd go with you."</p>

  <p>She thought she was making a concession, but at that there
  were two frightened people in the carriage.</p>

  <p>"That's is impossible," said the professor sharply, to hide
  his nervousness. "The circumstances put it out of court. The
  doctor has made you a kind and helpful offer&mdash;which comes
  best from a medical man."</p>

  <p>He opened the door of the trap again, but she shook her head.
  She would never go inside. Unless&mdash;of course she were
  tricked.</p>

  <p>It was a disquieting reflection, for she was beginning to
  think that she could trust no one. Even Hare had let her down.
  While he was, in reality, concerned about her condition, he had
  been facetious about Mrs. Barnes. According to him, she had asked
  him to send a telegram to some man called "Gabriel," while her
  husband was to be kept in the dark.</p>

  <p>Since it was impossible to connect the vicar's wife with a
  clandestine affair, Iris concluded that Hare had been trying to
  pull the wool over her eyes.</p>

  <p>She resented the feebleness of the effort, especially as Mrs.
  Barnes was connected with a poignant memory. It was she who had
  driven away Miss Froy and sent her groping back into Limbo.</p>

  <p>Iris could not forgive her for that, for she was missing badly
  the support which only the little governess could give. At this
  juncture, she knew she would be safe in those experienced hands.
  She felt terrified, sick, friendless&mdash;for she had burned her
  bridges.</p>

  <p>Besides, whenever she thought about the mystery, she felt near
  the border-line of that world which was filled with shifting
  shadows&mdash;where phantasy usurped reality, and she existed
  merely in the Red King's dream. Unless she kept a firm grip on
  herself, her sanity might hang&mdash;or crash&mdash;on the fact
  of Miss Froy's existence.</p>

  <p>There were others in that train full of holiday folk who were
  in a worse plight than herself. One was the invalid in the next
  carriage. Although she was chiefly unconscious, the flash of
  every lucid second held the horror of the shock which had stunned
  her into darkness. And if the moment lasted a fraction too long,
  there was time for a cloud of awful doubts to arise.</p>

  <p>"Where am I? What is going to happen to me? Where are they
  taking me?"</p>

  <p>Luckily, before these questions could be answered, the flare
  always died down again. So, therefore, she was in better case
  than Edna Barnes, who was in full possession of her faculties
  while she endured a protracted martyrdom of mental suffering.</p>

  <p>She had been completely happy in anticipation of their last
  mountain ramble when she saw the letter in the pigeonhole of the
  bureau. Her mother-in-law's handwriting gave her a warning pang
  which broke slightly the shock of the contents of the note.</p>

  <p>"I've been wondering what to do for the best," wrote the
  excellent lady. "I don't want to make you anxious during your
  long journey, yet, on the other hand, I feel I ought to prepare
  you for a disappointment. I had hoped to have Gabriel in perfect
  health for your return, and up to now he's been splendid. But now
  he has developed a cold in his chest. He is quite comfortable and
  the doctor says he is going on as well as can be expected. So
  there is no need for you to worry."</p>

  <p>Edna Barnes skimmed the letter in a flash which read between
  the lines. If her mother-in-law had composed it with a view to
  alarm her, she could not have succeeded better. All the familiar
  soothing phrases were there. "No need to worry." "As well as can
  be expected." "Comfortable"&mdash;the hospitable formula for a
  hopeless case.</p>

  <p>A cold on the chest could camouflage bronchitis or even
  pneumonia; and she had heard that a big strong baby, stricken by
  these complaints, was sometimes snuffed out after a few hours'
  illness. Her heart nearly burst as she wondered whether, at that
  moment, he were already dead.</p>

  <p>Then her husband called out to inquire the contents of the
  letter. The answer had been "Margaret Rose silk."</p>

  <p>She had lied with a fierce protective instinct to save him
  from her own agony. There was no need for two to suffer, if she
  could bear his pain for him. Screening her torment with her
  habitual smile, she racked her brains desperately for some reason
  to leave for England that same day.</p>

  <p>Just as the vicar took the packet of sandwiches from her,
  preparatory to their start, she snatched at the excuse of Miss
  Rose Flood-Porter's warning dream.</p>

  <p>Although he was disappointed, the vicar gave way to her in the
  matter. The sisters, too, decided to take no chances, when they
  heard that the vicar's wife had changed her plans owing to
  superstitious presentiments. As the honeymoon couple had
  previously decided to go, the exodus from the hotel was
  complete.</p>

  <p>For the first time Edna Barnes was glad that her husband
  suffered from train-sickness. While he sat with closed eyes and
  gritted teeth, she had some respite from acting. Her only
  consolation was knowing that she was on her way home. Therefore,
  when she was threatened with the prospect of an enforced delay at
  Trieste, she felt desperate.</p>

  <p>She was faced with the first real test of her
  principles&mdash;and her conscience won. Deception to save her
  husband from unnecessary suffering was a form of the lie
  magnificent. But now she told herself that the cause of humanity
  must come before family ties, because it was selfless.</p>

  <p>She was prepared to do her duty&mdash;whatever the
  cost&mdash;by Miss Froy. But when she was assured by those whose
  judgement she could trust, that the peril was negligible, her
  resolution slipped.</p>

  <p>The cause was too inadequate to exact such a sacrifice. On the
  evidence, it was nothing but the trumped-up invention of a
  hysterical girl to attract notice. But Gabriel was ill. He needed
  her, and he won.</p>

  <p>It was after she had identified Miss Kummer as Miss Froy that
  she suddenly realised the advantage of a willing young man who
  could send off a telegram to her mother-in-law. As she doubted
  whether she could receive the reply without her husband's
  knowledge&mdash;since her name might be bawled out by some
  official&mdash;she asked for the latest bulletin to await her at
  Calais. The sea-crossing would revive the vicar, while it would
  not be kind to keep him in the dark until he reached home.</p>

  <p>Although her eyes were tragic, she smiled faintly at the
  thought of his unconsciousness. Like a big baby he was sorry for
  his aches and pains, but he knew nothing of what he was
  spared.</p>

  <p>"Only a mother knows," she thought.</p>

  <p>This was exactly Mrs. Froy's own conviction as she sat in the
  twilight and hungered for her child's return.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; KILLING TIME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS a rule Mrs. Froy lived on the sunny side of
  the street. This evening, however, the long black shadows of the
  elms seemed to have stretched out to reach her mind, for she was
  unaccountably depressed.</p>

  <p>The sun no longer shone greenly through the creepers which
  muffled the windows, but she was accustomed to gloom. For reasons
  of economy, the lamp was never lit until the last possible
  moment. Neither was she influenced by the melancholy of the view
  from her bedroom, which overlooked a corner of the
  churchyard.</p>

  <p>Having dwelt in rectories for so long, it was second-habit for
  the Froys to live close to the church. Whenever she looked out at
  the slanting tombstones of forgotten dead, she had trained
  herself to picture a spectacular resurrection, when the graves
  suddenly burst open and their glorified contents shot up into the
  air like a glittering shower of rockets.</p>

  <p>This evening, when the green had all turned grey, she had her
  first misgivings.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it's healthy for us to sleep so near all those
  mouldering corpses."</p>

  <p>In ordinary circumstances she would have scoffed at her idea;
  but she could not dislodge the black monkey that sat on her
  shoulder. Vague misgivings and presentiments kept shaking through
  her mind.</p>

  <p>She told herself that she would be profoundly grateful when
  Winnie was safely home. Travel must be risky&mdash;otherwise
  railway companies would not issue insurance policies. Suppose
  Winnie were taken ill on the journey and had to be dumped in some
  foreign waiting-room.</p>

  <p>Anything might happen to her&mdash;a smash, or even worse. One
  read of terrible things which happened to girls travelling alone.
  Not that Winnie was actually a girl&mdash;thank
  goodness&mdash;but she was so young for her age.</p>

  <p>At this point Mrs. Froy took herself in charge.</p>

  <p>"Only two nights more," she reminded herself. "You ought to be
  happy as a queen, instead of carrying on like a weeping-willow
  with a stomach ache. Now, you find out what's at the bottom of
  all this."</p>

  <p>Before long she believed she had worked back to the original
  cause of her depression. It was the blackberry stain on the best
  tablecloth, which had not yielded entirely to salt.</p>

  <p>"Goose," she said. "It'll boil out in the wash."</p>

  <p>Making a face at the tombstones, she stumped out of the room
  and down the stairs in search of her husband.</p>

  <p>Contrary to custom she found him in the parlour sitting in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>"Lazybones, why haven't you lit the lamp?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In a minute." Mr. Froy's voice was unusually lifeless. "I've
  been brooding. Bad habit...It's an extraordinary thing that
  Winsome has been away so often, yet this is the first time I've
  ever felt apprehensive about her safety. These continental
  trains&mdash;I suppose I'm growing old. The ground is pulling
  me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy's heart gave a sudden leap as she listened. So he,
  too, had caught the warning whisper.</p>

  <p>Without speaking, she struck a match, turned up the wick of
  the lamp, lit it, and fitted on the chimney. As she waited for
  the glass to warm through, she looked at her husband's face,
  visible in the weak glow.</p>

  <p>It appeared white, bloodless and bony&mdash;the face of a man
  who should be going to bed in a damp corner under the window,
  instead of sharing her spring-mattress.</p>

  <p>At the sight she exploded with the righteous wrath of a woman
  who is rough on shadows.</p>

  <p>"Never let me hear you talk like that again," she scolded.
  "You're as bad as Miss Parsons. She's only sixty-six, yet the
  last time we came back from town together, she grumbled because
  the bus was full and she had to stand. I said, 'My dear, don't
  let every one know that you are not accustomed to court circles.'
  And then I said, 'Take my seat. I'm young.'"</p>

  <p>"Did the people in the bus laugh?" asked Mr. Froy
  appreciatively.</p>

  <p>In the circle of mellow lamplight his face had lost its
  pallor. Before she replied, his wife pounced on the window-cords
  and rattled the green window-curtains together, shutting out the
  bogie-twilight.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "they simply roared. Then some one started to
  clap. But when I thought the joke had gone far enough, I stopped
  it...I <i>looked</i> at them."</p>

  <p>Although Mrs. Froy was proud of her gifts as a comedian, her
  sense of dignity was stronger. Her head was held high, as though
  she were still quelling her audience, as she inquired, "Where is
  Sock?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I'm afraid he is waiting outside until it is time to
  meet the train. I do wish I could make the poor fellow understand
  it's Friday."</p>

  <p>"I'll make him," announced Mrs. Froy. "Sock."</p>

  <p>The big dog shambled in immediately, for although normally too
  spoiled to be obedient, he always respected a certain rasp in his
  mistress's voice.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy took three biscuits from the tin and laid them in a
  row on the fender-stool.</p>

  <p>"Look, darling," she said. "Mother's got three biscuits for
  you. This is to-night, but Winnie's not coming to-night. This is
  to-morrow, but Winnie's not coming to-morrow. <i>This</i> is
  Friday, and Winnie's coming Friday and you shall go and meet the
  train...Remember&mdash;this one."</p>

  <p>Sock looked up at her as though he were straining to
  understand&mdash;his amber eyes beaming with intelligence under
  his wisps of hair, for his head had not been shorn.</p>

  <p>"He understands," declared Mrs. Froy. "I can always talk to
  animals. Perhaps our vibrations are the same. I know what's in
  his mind and I can always make him know what is in mine."</p>

  <p>She turned back to the fender-stool and picked up the first
  biscuit.</p>

  <p>"This is to-night," she explained. "Well, to-night's over. So
  you can eat to-night."</p>

  <p>Sock entered into the spirit of the game. While he was making
  a mess of crumbs on the mat, Mrs. Froy spoke to her husband.</p>

  <p>"That's an end of to-night for us, too," she said. "And good
  riddance. I wish you would remember that it's bad form to go
  half-way to meet troubles which are not coming to your house, and
  which have no intention of calling on you...What are you grinning
  at?"</p>

  <p>Shaking with laughter, Mr. Froy pointed to Sock, who was in
  the act of crunching the last biscuit.</p>

  <p>"'He understands,'" he quoted with gentle mockery.</p>

  <p>The sight of his face made Mrs. Froy forget her momentary
  discomfiture. It looked years younger. There was no question now
  of where he ought to sleep that night.</p>

  <p>She patted Sock, kissed his nose and flicked the biscuit
  crumbs from his coat.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said tartly, "he understands&mdash;and better than
  you do. Don't you see that he is trying to make the time pass
  quicker?"</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; STAKE YOUR
  COUNTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT that moment others besides Mrs. Froy were
  anxious to speed up the march of time. Some were on the express
  which was being stoked up for its final spurt, to reach Trieste
  on time.</p>

  <p>One of these&mdash;Mrs. Todhunter&mdash;hid her impatience
  under a pose of nonchalance. Wherever she went, she attracted
  notice and she also excited feminine envy by her special
  atmosphere of romance. Apparently she had everything that a woman
  could want&mdash;beauty, poise, exquisite clothes, and a wealthy,
  distinguished bridegroom.</p>

  <p>In reality she was feverishly eager to get back to her
  husband.</p>

  <p>He was a stout middle-aged building-contractor, named Cecil
  Parmiter. When at home Mrs. Laura Parmiter lived in a super-fine
  new house, with all those modern improvements which her husband
  introduced into the blocks of flats he built for others&mdash;and
  with none of their short-comings. She had a comfortable income, a
  generous allowance, competent servants, leisure, a trusting
  affectionate husband and two large children.</p>

  <p>She had the additional detail of respectability.</p>

  <p>Although she was the social queen of her set, she was secretly
  ambitious and discontented. During the rehearsals of a local
  pageant, when class-distinctions were levelled, she met a certain
  rising barrister&mdash;a visitor to the district, who had been
  roped into taking a part. He was a king and she was a
  queen&mdash;and the royal atmosphere lent a glamour to their
  meetings.</p>

  <p>He was infatuated&mdash;temporarily&mdash;by her statuesque
  beauty and the facility with which she could quote passages from
  Swinburne and Browning, culled from her Oxford Book of Verse.
  After a few meetings in London, under the seal of the apple, he
  swept her away with him on a passionate adventure.</p>

  <p>Although she lost her footing, Mrs. Laura's brain still
  functioned. She had a definite ulterior motive for her surrender.
  During a session of Browning lectures, she had read "The Statue
  and the Bust" and had imbibed its spirit. She determined,
  therefore, to risk her counter on a bold fling&mdash;the chance
  of a double divorce.</p>

  <p>After the preliminary patch of mud was crossed, she would take
  her rightful place in Society as the beautiful wife of a
  distinguished barrister. The world soon forgets&mdash;while she
  was confident that she could compel her husband to admit her
  moral claim to the children.</p>

  <p>She lost...And Browning could have been proud of the spirit in
  which she took her toss.</p>

  <p>The barrister was married to a sour elderly wife; but she
  possessed both a title and wealth. When Mrs. Laura discovered
  that he had not the slightest intention of making their adventure
  a prelude to matrimony, her pride forbade her to show any
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>Perhaps her nonchalance was easier to assume by reason of her
  own disillusionment. The passionate adventure had not matured
  according to its promise. It taught her that a professional man
  did not differ so greatly from a tradesman in essentials and that
  they looked much the same before shaving and without their
  collars.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the barrister had a handicap from which the builder
  was immune. He was a hard snorer.</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, while he was careless of his own
  failings, his standard for women was so fastidious that she found
  it a strain to live up to it. She could never relax, or be
  natural, without being conscious of his criticism or
  impatience.</p>

  <p>Being practical, she determined to cut short the holiday and
  get back to her husband while the going was good. Fortunately,
  she had not burned any bridges. Her husband had bought her return
  ticket to Turin, and she had told him to expect no mail, since he
  was going on a sea trip to the Shetlands.</p>

  <p>Her plan was to leave the barrister at Turin, where he had
  joined her on the outward journey, and to stay there, for a
  night, so that her luggage could display the hotel labels.</p>

  <p>The end of it all would be a happy domestic reunion and a
  better understanding, for&mdash;by contrast&mdash;she had learnt
  to appreciate her husband's solidity. Thus one more matrimonial
  shipwreck had been averted by a trial-venture and a smashed code
  of morality.</p>

  <p>As the Todhunters sat in their coupé, waiting for the second
  dinner to be served, they were a spectacle which attracted the
  interest of the tourists who straggled past the window. They must
  still be known by the name in which they had registered, since
  the barrister was too cautious to sign his own name.</p>

  <p>It was "Brown."</p>

  <p>However, his parents had done their best for him, and his
  title of "Sir Peveril Brown" was sufficiently well-known to be
  dangerous&mdash;in addition to a striking profile which had been
  reproduced often in the pictorial press.</p>

  <p>True to her character of Browning's good loser, Mrs. Laura
  continued to play her part. Although her acquired drawl was
  replaced sometimes by her natural accent she still looked choice
  and aloof as a beautiful princess&mdash;remote from the rabble.
  But her fingers kept tapping the greasy old-gold plush seat,
  while she glanced continuously at her watch.</p>

  <p>"Still hours and hours," she said impatiently. "It seems as
  though we'd never make Trieste&mdash;let alone Turin."</p>

  <p>"Anxious to drop me?" asked Todhunter incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking of you...But children get measles&mdash;and
  deserted husbands prove unfaithful. The world is full of pretty
  typists."</p>

  <p>"In that case, he'd have nothing on you, if it came to a show-
  up."</p>

  <p>She started at the word.</p>

  <p>"Show-up? Don't give me the jitters," she cried sharply.
  "There's no chance of it, is there?"</p>

  <p>He stroked his lip.</p>

  <p>"I should say we are reasonably secure," he told her.
  "Still...I've handled some queer cases in my career. One never
  knows what will break. It was unfortunate that there were any
  English visitors at the hotel. And you are entirely too beautiful
  to remain anonymous."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laura shook off his hand. She wanted reassurance, not
  compliments.</p>

  <p>"You told me there was no risk," she said. Forgetting that her
  original scheme had been to force her husband to take action, she
  added bitterly, "What a fool I've been."</p>

  <p>"Why are you suddenly so anxious to get back to your husband?"
  asked Todhunter.</p>

  <p>"Well, to be brutally frank, we are all of us out for what we
  can get. And he can give me more than you can."</p>

  <p>"Haven't I given you a memory you'll never forget?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laura's eyes flashed angrily, and Todhunter laughed. He
  had grown rather bored by the languid beauty and her synthetic
  culture; but now that she had suddenly become alive, he was aware
  of the fact that she was slipping from him.</p>

  <p>"I was only teasing you," he said. "Of course, no one will
  ever know about us. I could risk nothing like that...But we might
  have been in a jam if I had not thought a jump ahead when that
  girl asked me about the peeping woman."</p>

  <p>"Why," asked Laura, who had only grasped the fact that
  Todhunter would never go an inch out of his way to champion an
  unattractive middle-aged woman.</p>

  <p>"Why? Because she's disappeared. If I had not repudiated her,
  I should have to make a statement at Trieste," Todhunter laughed.
  "Can't you see the headlines? 'Englishwoman lost on Continental
  express: Photograph of Mr. Todhunter who was on his honeymoon,
  when...And thus and thus. It wouldn't be long before the English
  press got on to my identity. One of the penalties of
  fame&mdash;however limited."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laura did not look as impressed as he wished, for his
  words had raised a new issue.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, after all, the game was not lost, because it was not
  yet ended. Although Todhunter had no intention of risking a
  scandal when he lured her away on this trip, she saw a chance to
  engineer one and so force his hand.</p>

  <p>If she went to the professor and assured him of Miss Froy's
  existence the result was bound to be future complications. There
  could be no doubt of the professor's probity and public spirit,
  which would enforce an investigation&mdash;whatever the cost to
  his personal convenience.</p>

  <p>Her violet eyes suddenly glittered. As the beautiful bride of
  the alleged Todhunter, she was an important detail in the
  picture, and one that reporters would not overlook or suppress.
  She always made such an appealing photograph.</p>

  <p>Afterwards there would be a sensational divorce case, and Sir
  Peveril&mdash;in honour bound&mdash;would be obliged to make her
  the second Lady Brown.</p>

  <p>At the thought she drew a deep breath, for the wheel was still
  spinning.</p>

  <p>Her counter was not yet lost.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24" name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; THE WHEEL
  SPINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. LAURA sat and looked at the window which
  held the reflection of the lighted carriage, thrown on panels of
  rushing darkness. She smiled at her dimly-mirrored
  face&mdash;smoky-dark, with shadowed eyes and triumphant lips.
  The wheel was still spinning for her.</p>

  <p>And since their fates were interlinked it was spinning also
  for Miss Froy. The little spinster was in a perilous plight, but
  she was an obstinate optimist. She clung to the hope that
  everything would come right in the end, and that at long last she
  would reach home.</p>

  <p>Miss Froy loved her home with that intense perverted passion
  which causes ardent patriots to desert their native lands and
  makes men faithless to their wives. Like them, she left what she
  loved most&mdash;for the joy of the return.</p>

  <p>This special absence had been a thrilling experience. During
  the first six months of exile, she had been excited by the
  novelty of living in semi-royal surroundings. Everything was so
  exaggerated and unreal that she had a confused sense of having
  strayed into some fairy tale. She wandered and lost herself amid
  a maze of pillared halls and gilded apartments. There seemed to
  be endless marble stairs&mdash;countless galleries&mdash;all
  duplicated in enormous mirrors, so that at least one-half of the
  castle was illusion.</p>

  <p>The scenery, in its breathless beauty, held the same
  bewildering quality of unreality. In her letters to her family
  she gave up the attempt to describe blue and purple mountains,
  whose white crests smashed through the sky&mdash;boiling jade
  rivers&mdash;lush green valleys&mdash;towering precipices.</p>

  <p>"There aren't enough adjectives," she wrote. "But it's all
  simply topping."</p>

  <p>True to schedule, however, when she cracked her seventh month
  of absence, her rapture suffered its first eclipse and she began
  to realise the drawbacks of living in a castle. To begin with she
  got lost no longer, and there were not so many marble staircases,
  since she had located the mirrors.</p>

  <p>There were other unpleasant details, including fleas in the
  thick carpets and rich upholstery, for the hounds were many and
  the servants few.</p>

  <p>Her vast bedroom, which was like a stage royal apartment, was
  comfortless and cold, since the enormous coloured porcelain
  stove&mdash;resembling a cathedral altar-piece&mdash;was
  insufficiently stoked.</p>

  <p>There were ten courses for dinner&mdash;but only one knife and
  fork, which the diner cleaned with bread.</p>

  <p>All the men were handsome and respectful, but none seemed to
  realise that she was a curly-headed girl whose pet sport was
  refusing curates.</p>

  <p>Before her last five months were up she became so homesick
  that her longing for a small stone house&mdash;backed by an apple
  orchard, and overlooking a country church yard&mdash;grew to a
  passion. Sick of the theatrical scenery, she would have exchanged
  all the mountains and rivers for one corner <i>of</i> an English
  meadow with a clump of elms and a duck-pond.</p>

  <p>The night before her return her excitement was so great that
  she could not sleep, in anticipation of her journey. She could
  not believe in it, although her luggage was packed and labelled.
  One suitcase held soiled linen, destined for a real good boil.
  She did her personal washing in the bathroom, by stealth, since
  she had seen too many pails emptied into the beautiful green
  river which was the communal laundry.</p>

  <p>As she lay and tossed she heard the faint scream of an engine,
  muted by distance to an amplified mosquito-ping. It was the night
  express, which&mdash;when farther down the valley&mdash;woke up
  the homesick sleepers in the hotel and whistled their thoughts
  after it, as though it were a monstrous metallic Pied Piper.</p>

  <p>Just as, later, it called to Iris, it now drew the little
  spinster from her bed. She ran to the window and was in time to
  see it shoot past the end of the gorge, like a golden rod of
  light slipping into grooves of darkness.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night I shall be in an express, too," she
  gloated.</p>

  <p>It was a rapture to anticipate her long journey, stage by
  stage and frontier by frontier, until she reached a small dingy
  station which was merely a halt built amid empty fields. No one
  would meet her there, because her father was afraid that
  blundering Sock, in his ecstasy, might leap at the engine and try
  to lick its face too.</p>

  <p>But they would be waiting for her farther down the
  lane&mdash;and her eyes grew misty at the thought of that
  meeting. Yet even then she would not reach her journey's end
  until she ran through a dim white gate and a starlit garden, to
  see the light streaming through an open door.</p>

  <p>"Mater," said Miss Froy, with a lump in her throat.</p>

  <p>Then a sudden fear touched her heart.</p>

  <p>"I've never been so homesick before," she thought. "Is it a
  warning? Suppose&mdash;suppose something happened&mdash;to keep
  me from getting home."</p>

  <p>Something happened&mdash;something so monstrous and unexpected
  that she could not really believe in it. It was an adventure
  which could only be credited in connection with any one else.</p>

  <p>At first she was certain that some one would soon come to her
  aid. She told herself it was a fortunate circumstance that she
  had met the charming English girl. They were compatriots, and she
  could rely on her with utmost confidence, because&mdash;were the
  situation reversed&mdash;she knew she would tear the train apart,
  wheel by wheel, in order to find her.</p>

  <p>But as the time crawled on and nothing happened, doubts began
  to flock into her mind. She remembered that the girl had a touch
  of sunstroke and was far from well. She might be worse, or even
  seriously ill. Besides it would be difficult to try to explain
  the circumstances when one was ignorant of the language.</p>

  <p>There was an even worse possibility. Iris might have tried to
  intervene and been snatched up, too, in the great machine which
  had caught her up in one of its revolutions. At the thought, Miss
  Froy's lip grew beaded from desperation and fear.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, she felt the braking of the train. Its clatter
  and roar died down to a grinding slither, and with a mighty jerk
  the engine stopped.</p>

  <p>"They've missed me," she thought triumphantly. "Now they are
  going to search the train."</p>

  <p>And once again she saw the lights of home streaming through
  the open door.</p>

  <p>As she waited in happy expectation she would have been
  surprised and gratified to know that the beautiful
  bride&mdash;who looked like a film star&mdash;was thinking of
  her.</p>

  <p>Although she was only a pawn, she was the central figure in a
  plot to restore her liberty. At that moment the professor was
  standing in the corridor just outside Mrs. Laura's coupé. She had
  only to call to him and Miss Froy's ultimate release would be put
  in train.</p>

  <p>As there was plenty of time before Trieste was reached, she
  delayed in order to be quite certain of the wisdom of her
  decision. Once she had applied the match she could not stop the
  blaze of publicity.</p>

  <p>In reality, however, her mind was made up. Although she had
  discovered the barrister's drawbacks he was the original prize
  for which she had played. When she was Lady Brown, Sir Peveril
  would be merely a husband and she knew how to deal with this
  useful domestic animal. Hitherto she had been humiliated by the
  knowledge that his programme did not include marriage, and in her
  anxiety to impress him favourably, she had developed an
  inferiority complex.</p>

  <p>Royal smashing tactics suited her better. Her voice was
  arrogant as she spoke to the barrister.</p>

  <p>"What are we stopping for?" she asked, looking out at a
  squalid platform, dimly visible in a few flickering lights.</p>

  <p>"Frontier," explained the barrister.</p>

  <p>"Help. Have we got to get out and go through the Customs?"</p>

  <p>"No, we take on the officials here...What's that shock headed
  lunatic up to?"</p>

  <p>The barrister frowned as Hare raced into the telegraph office,
  shouting back the while to the guard who was yelling to him. It
  was evidently a first-class slanging match, but unintelligible to
  the English passengers who were deprived of its finer points.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact it had struck the bright young man that he
  could save his own valuable time at Trieste if he took advantage
  of the halt to send off Mrs. Barnes' telegram to Bath, England.
  The idea, however, did not make him popular with his
  compatriots.</p>

  <p>"Fool's holding us up," growled the barrister, looking at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>To his surprise Laura was perfectly calm at the menace to
  their time-table.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?" she drawled. "We shall get there."</p>

  <p>"We might lose our connection. We've cut it pretty fine. That
  reminds me of something. I was wondering whether, in your
  interests, we had better part before we get into Italy. We might
  run up against some one we know."</p>

  <p>"Personally I should not compare Italy with Piccadilly Circus.
  Still, it's on the map. What do you want to do?"</p>

  <p>"I could take the Trieste-Paris express. Could you manage by
  yourself at Milan?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. I shall find some one. Or some one will find me.
  In any case, I can look after myself."</p>

  <p>There was a confident note in her voice&mdash;associated with
  the dismissal of cooks&mdash;for the professor had just gone back
  to his compartment. She rose from her seat, prepared to follow
  him, when the Customs officials appeared at the end of the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>That check was of vital importance to Miss Froy. As Laura did
  not wish to be interrupted, she wanted for the professor's
  luggage to be examined. In the interval the barrister had sensed
  a situation which prompted a few leading questions.</p>

  <p>"What makes you look so serious?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You forget, this may be serious for me."</p>

  <p>"In what way? We're not parting for ever, are we? I can meet
  you in London."</p>

  <p>"How nice."</p>

  <p>Now that her pride was no longer a buffer between the natural
  woman and self-expression, Laura felt mistress of the situation.
  She held the winning card.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering," she said, "if I can endure the name of
  'Brown; after being Mrs. Parmiter."</p>

  <p>"Will the occasion arise?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if there's a divorce, you could hardly let me down.
  It's not done, is it, darling?"</p>

  <p>"But, my sweet, there will be no divorce."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure. I know you made it very plain to me that you
  would not give your wife the evidence to divorce you. But she'll
  read about us in the papers&mdash;and no woman could stand for
  that."</p>

  <p>"You seem very sure of your publicity. Perhaps you have a
  better knowledge of the possibilities than I have?"</p>

  <p>The barrister glowered at her as though she were a hostile
  witness, for he had realised the threat which underlay her
  smiles.</p>

  <p>She meant to try to rush a situation.</p>

  <p>"I can reassure you on one point," he said coldly. "If your
  husband brings an action, you may lose your own charming name.
  But you will not be called upon to make the greater sacrifice.
  There is already one Lady Brown...My wife will never divorce
  me."</p>

  <p>Laura stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"You mean, she'd take it lying down?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Does the posture matter? The point is that we have a complete
  understanding. It would be against our mutual interests ever to
  part company...But I think here is no real risk of publicity. Do
  you?"</p>

  <p>He knew he had won and she knew it too. His cool level voice
  stirred up Laura's smouldering passion.</p>

  <p>"If there was," she said, "it seems as if I was the only one
  that stood to lose. You boast that your wife won't divorce you.
  Well, my husband would. And I thank God for it. At least I am
  married to a real man with decent natural feelings."</p>

  <p>The barrister screwed his monocle in his eye in an instinctive
  effort to preserve his dignity.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've disappointed you," he said. "I had no idea
  that I had led you to hope for anything beyond a pleasant and
  unconventional holiday."</p>

  <p>Before Laura could speak, the Customs officer entered their
  compartment and was very courteous and obliging over the luggage
  and passport of the distinguished Englishman and his beautiful
  bride.</p>

  <p>After he had gone the professor appeared again in the
  corridor&mdash;still puffing at his pipe.</p>

  <p>Laura shivered at the sight of him because he reminded her of
  what she had nearly lost by a premature disclosure. Her fine
  house, her social position, her respectability, and perhaps even
  her children would all have been swept away for a man who would
  not marry her.</p>

  <p>"Thanks be I sounded him first," she told herself.</p>

  <p>Her gain was Miss Froy's loss. The express carried a ghost-
  passenger, whose passport&mdash;although in order&mdash;was never
  examined. An experienced traveller, she realised what had
  actually happened when the train began to move slowly for the
  second time.</p>

  <p>"Frontier," she thought.</p>

  <p>But in the interval between picking up the Customs officials
  and dropping them again, she swept through a cycle of emotions,
  as she shot up from midnight to sunshine, and then&mdash;through
  the gradual twilight of suspense, deferred hope and
  anxiety&mdash;sank back again into darkness.</p>

  <p>The train rushed on.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25" name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; "STRANGE
  DISAPPEARANCE"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER the Professor had left her Iris slumped
  down in her seat and listened to the choppy current of the
  train's frantic rhythm. The grimed glass was beginning to grow
  steamy, so that it was difficult to see anything outside the
  window, except an occasional line of lights when the express
  flashed through some small station.</p>

  <p>Since Miss Froy had been proved non-existent by the laws of
  logic she felt too flat to be interested in her surroundings. She
  had not even sufficient spirit to remain angry with the professor
  for his interference.</p>

  <p>"All travellers are selfish," she reflected. "It was those
  Miss Flood-Porters. They were afraid they might be saddled with
  me, so they got at the professor. I expect he consulted the
  doctor about what could be done."</p>

  <p>She straightened herself in an effort to relieve the aching of
  her back. The continual shaking of the train had worn her out,
  while her neck felt as though it were made of plaster of Paris
  and would crack in two if she jerked it. At that moment she
  longed for a comfortable bed where she could rest, far from the
  incessant rattle and din.</p>

  <p>It was the doctor's suggestion&mdash;a good night's rest. Yet,
  although she began to doubt her own wisdom in trying to swim
  against the current, she remained set in her determination to
  oppose advice.</p>

  <p>Presently Hare entered and sat opposite to her in Miss
  Kummer's seat.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked hopefully. "Going to stop off at
  Trieste?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Iris stiffly.</p>

  <p>"But are you sure you're fit to go on?"</p>

  <p>"Does it matter to you?"</p>

  <p>"No. But, all the same, I'm worried stiff about you."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know. It's not a habit of mine."</p>

  <p>Against her will Iris smiled faintly. She could not forget
  Miss Froy. The memory of her was a grumbling undercurrent, like
  the aching of a stopped tooth. Yet whenever Hare was present he
  acted in the same manner as a local application that deadened the
  pain. In spite of her misery there was a queer thrill in being
  alone with him on the same nightmare journey.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up," he said. "You'll soon be home. Back with your
  colony of friends."</p>

  <p>The prospect seemed suddenly distasteful to Iris.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see one of them," she declared petulantly. "I
  don't want to get back. I've no home. And nothing seems worth
  while."</p>

  <p>"What do you do with yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing...Oh, play about."</p>

  <p>"With other chaps?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We all do the same things. Silly things. There's not one
  real person among the lot of us...Sometimes I get terrified. I'm
  wasting my youth. What's at the end of it all?"</p>

  <p>Hare made no attempt to console her or answer her question. He
  stared out at the darkness with a half-smile playing round his
  mouth. When he began to talk, it was about himself.</p>

  <p>"My life's very different from yours. I never know where I'm
  going next. But it's always rough. And things happen. Not always
  pleasant things...Still, if I could take you with me on my next
  job, you'd get a complete change. You'd go without every comfort
  a refined home should have&mdash;but I'd lay you odds you'd never
  feel bored again."</p>

  <p>"Sounds lovely...Are you proposing to me?"</p>

  <p>"No. Just waiting to dodge when you start to throw custard
  pies at me."</p>

  <p>"But lots of men propose to me. And I'd like to go to a rough
  place."</p>

  <p>"Fine. Now I can go into it seriously. Got any money?"</p>

  <p>"Some. Just chicken feed."</p>

  <p>"Suits me. I've none."</p>

  <p>They were scarcely conscious of what they said as they talked
  at random in the only language they knew&mdash;their light words
  utterly at variance with the yearning in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know," said Hare, breaking a pause, "all this is rot. I'm
  only doing it to take your mind off things."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;Miss Froy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, confound the woman."</p>

  <p>To his surprise Iris changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"What sort of brain have you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Fair to middling, when it's lubricated. It works best on
  beer."</p>

  <p>"Could you write a detective thriller?"</p>

  <p>"No. Can't spell."</p>

  <p>"But could you solve one?"</p>

  <p>"Every time."</p>

  <p>"Then suppose you give me a demonstration. You've been very
  clever in proving Miss Froy could not exist. But&mdash;if she
  did&mdash;could you find out what might have happened to her? Or
  is it too difficult?"</p>

  <p>Hare burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"I used to think," he said, "that if ever I liked a girl, I'd
  be cut out by some beautiful band conductor with waved hair. I'm
  hanged if I thought I'd have to play second fiddle to an ancient
  governess. Time's revenge, I suppose. Long ago, I bit one. And
  she was a good governess...Well, here goes."</p>

  <p>He lit his pipe and furrowed his brow while Iris watched him
  with intense interest. His face&mdash;no longer slack and
  careless&mdash;was hardened into lines of concentration, so that
  he looked almost a different man. Sometimes he ran his fingers
  through his hair, when his rebellious tuft flared up rampant and
  sometimes he chuckled.</p>

  <p>Presently he gave a crow of triumph.</p>

  <p>"I've got it to fit. Bit of jiggery-pokery in parts, but it
  hangs together. Now would you like to hear an original story
  called 'The Strange Disappearance of Miss Froy?'"</p>

  <p>Iris winced at the light tone.</p>

  <p>"I'd love to," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Then you're for it. But, first of all, when you boarded the
  train, was there one nun next door to you, or two?"</p>

  <p>"I only noticed one as we passed the carriage. She had a
  horrible face."</p>

  <p>"Hum. My story demands a second one, later on."</p>

  <p>"That's convenient, because there is another one. I met her in
  the corridor."</p>

  <p>"Seen her since?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I shouldn't notice one way or another. There's such a
  jam."</p>

  <p>"Good. That proves that no one would be likely to notice
  whether there was one nun, or two, connected with the invalid
  outfit. Especially as it's corked up at the end of the corridor.
  You see, I've got to play about with these blessed nuns, so
  they're very important."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Go on."</p>

  <p>"I haven't started yet. The nun part was preamble. Here really
  goes...Miss Froy is a spy who's got some information which she's
  sneaking out of the country. So she's got to be bumped off. And
  what better way than on a railway journey?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;they've thrown her on the rails going through
  a tunnel?" asked Iris faintly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd. And don't look so wan. If they chucked her
  on the line her body would be found and awkward questions asked.
  No, she's got to <i>disappear</i>. And what I was getting at was
  this. On a journey, a lot of valuable time will be wasted before
  it can be proved even that she is missing. At first her people
  will think she's lost a connection or stopped at Paris for a day
  or two, to shop. So, by the time they get busy, the trail will be
  stone cold."</p>

  <p>"But they wouldn't know what to do. They're old and
  helpless."</p>

  <p>"Tough luck. You're making my tale positively pathetic. But
  even if they are influential and know the ropes, when they begin
  to make inquiries they'd find themselves up against a conspiracy
  of silence."</p>

  <p>"Why, is the whole train in the plot?"</p>

  <p>"No, just the baroness, the doctor and the nuns. Of course,
  there'd be a passive conspiracy of silence, as I mentioned
  before. None of the passengers, who are local folk, would dare to
  contradict any statement of the baroness."</p>

  <p>"But, don't forget the baroness said something to the ticket
  collector which you couldn't understand."</p>

  <p>"Is this my yarn or yours? But&mdash;perhaps you're right.
  There may be a railway official or two in it. In fact, there must
  have been some dirty work at the cross-roads over her reserved
  seat. They had to be sure that she would be in the baroness'
  compartment, and at the end of the train."</p>

  <p>"Next door to the doctor, too...But what's <i>happened to
  her</i>?"</p>

  <p>In spite of her resolution to keep cool, Iris clenched her
  fingers in suspense as she waited.</p>

  <p>"Aha," gloated Hare. "That's where my brain comes in...Miss
  Froy is lying in the next compartment to this, covered with rugs,
  and disguised with bandages and trimmings. Her own mother
  wouldn't know her now."</p>

  <p>"How? When?"</p>

  <p>"It happened when you obligingly dropped off to sleep. Enter
  the doctor. He asks Miss Froy if she could render some slight
  service to his patient. I'm sure I don't know why he should rope
  her in as he's got a nurse on tap. But she'll go."</p>

  <p>"I know she would."</p>

  <p>"Well, directly she enters the compartment she gets the
  surprise of her life. To begin with all the blinds are drawn down
  and the place is in darkness. She smells a rat, but before she
  can squeal the three of them set on her."</p>

  <p>"The three?"</p>

  <p>"Ja, the patient is one of the gang. One of them pinions her,
  the other throttles her so she can't shout, and the doctor is
  busy giving her an injection, to make her unconscious."</p>

  <p>Iris felt her heart hammer as she pictured the scene. "It
  <i>could</i> happen," she said.</p>

  <p>Hare gave her a delighted beam.</p>

  <p>"Wish I had you to listen to my golf-stories. You've got the
  right reaction to lies. Artistic ones, of course...By the way,
  one of the nuns is a man. The one with the ugly face."</p>

  <p>"I believe she is."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so prejudiced. All men aren't ugly. Well, Miss Froy
  is now down and out, so they're able to bandage her up roughly,
  and stick a lot of plaster over her face, to disguise her. Then
  they tie her up, gag her, and lay her out, in the place of the
  false patient, who was already dressed in uniform, only she was
  covered with rugs. So she's only to pull off her plaster and
  stick a veil over her bandaged head, to look the perfect nun.
  Number two."</p>

  <p>"I saw a second one in the corridor," nodded Iris.</p>

  <p>"But, by now, you've unearthed some English people who will
  remember Miss Froy, and you've roped in the parson's wife. As I
  think I explained before, the conspirators have to produce some
  one, and trust to bluff. So, down comes the blind again, while
  the second nun&mdash;the one who posed as the original patient,
  dresses herself in Miss Froy's clothes."</p>

  <p>As Iris remained silent Hare looked rather depressed.</p>

  <p>"Admittedly feeble," he said, "but the best I can do."</p>

  <p>Iris scarcely heard him, for she was nerving herself to ask a
  question.</p>

  <p>"What will happen to her when they reach Trieste?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is the part my readers will adore," explained Hare.
  "She'll be put in an ambulance and taken to some lonely house,
  overlooking deep deserted water&mdash;a creek, or arm of the
  river, or something. You know the sort of thing&mdash;black oily
  water lapping a derelict quay. Then she'll be weighted, and all
  that, and neatly dumped among the mud and ooze. But I'm not
  altogether ruthless. I'll let them keep her drugged to the bitter
  end. So the old dear'll know nothing about it...Here. What's
  up?"</p>

  <p>Iris had sprung to her feet and was tugging at the door.
  "Everything you say may be true," she panted. "We mustn't waste
  time. We must do something."</p>

  <p>Hare forced her back to her seat.</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;you," he said. Already she meant everything to him
  but he'd completely forgotten her name. "This is simply a yarn I
  made up for you."</p>

  <p>"But I must get to that patient," cried Iris. "It's Miss Froy.
  I must see for myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool. The patient next door is <i>real,</i> and
  she's been smashed up. If we forced our way into that carriage
  and started to make any fuss the doctor would order us out. And
  quite right too."</p>

  <p>"Then you won't help me?" asked Iris despairingly.</p>

  <p>"Definitely no. I'm sorry to keep harping on it, but I can't
  forget your sunstroke. And when I remember my own experience and
  how I mistook my own footer captain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For the Prince of Wales. I know, I know."</p>

  <p>"I'm frightfully sorry I led you on. I only told you how
  things <i>might</i> be worked. But I'm just like the old lady who
  saw a giraffe for the first time. Honestly, 'I <i>don't believe
  it</i>.'"</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26" name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; SIGNATURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"OF course," agreed Iris dully, "you were just
  making it up. What a fool I am."</p>

  <p>As she tried to stifle her disappointment some
  one&mdash;farther down the corridor&mdash;began to speak in an
  unnaturally loud voice. The words were unintelligible to her and
  sounded like an incantation for rain; but Hare's face lit up.</p>

  <p>"Some one's got a wireless set," he said springing up. "It's
  the news. Back in two shakes."</p>

  <p>When he returned he told Iris what he had heard.</p>

  <p>"Another good murder sensation gone west. The medical evidence
  on the editor states he was shot about midnight&mdash;while the
  High Hat had left for his hunting lodge directly after dinner. So
  they can't hang it on him. Pity."</p>

  <p>As he spoke something floated across Iris' memory, like one of
  those spirals of cobweb which are wafted on the air on still
  autumn mornings. She started up as Hare looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Nearly time for the second dinner," he told her.
  "Coming?"</p>

  <p>"No. But the others will be coming back."</p>

  <p>"What's the odds? Are you frightened of them?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd. But they make a little clump, all together,
  this end. And I&mdash;I don't like being so near that
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Not frightened then. Well, our compartment will be empty
  while the professor and I are having dinner. I am willing to sub-
  let it, at a nominal rent, to a good tenant."</p>

  <p>After he had gone Iris felt the old limpness stealing over
  her. A long-drawn howl, as though some damned soul were
  lamenting, followed by the rattle of machine-gun fire, told her
  that they were passing through a tunnel. It suggested a gruesome
  possibility.</p>

  <p>Suppose&mdash;at that minute&mdash;a dead body were being
  thrown out of the train.</p>

  <p>She reminded herself that Hare's story was fiction and managed
  to drive it from her mind. But another tale&mdash;which she had
  read in a magazine and which was supposed to be
  authentic&mdash;slipped in to take its place.</p>

  <p>It was about two ladies who arrived by night at a continental
  hotel, on their way back from an oriental tour. The daughter
  carefully noted the number of her mother's room before she went
  to her own. When she returned some time later, she found no trace
  of her mother, while the room itself had different furniture and
  a new wallpaper.</p>

  <p>When she made inquiries, the entire staff, from the manager
  downwards, assured her that she had come to the hotel alone. The
  mother's name was not in the register. The cab-driver and the
  porters at the railway terminus all supported the conspiracy.</p>

  <p>The mother had been blown out like a match.</p>

  <p>Of course there was an explanation. In the daughter's absence
  the mother had died of plague, contracted in the East. The mere
  rumour would have kept away millions of visitors from the
  exhibition about to be held in the city. With such important
  interests at stake a unit had to be sacrificed.</p>

  <p>Iris' hands began to grow clammy as she wondered whether Miss
  Froy's disappearance might not be a parallel on a very small
  scale. In her case it would not involve a vast and complicated
  organisation, or a fantastic conspiracy&mdash;merely the
  collusion of a few interested persons.</p>

  <p>And Hare had shown her how it <i>could</i> be worked.</p>

  <p>She began to try to fit the facts to the theory. To begin
  with, although the baroness was wealthy, she was sharing a
  compartment with the proletariat. Why? Because she had decided to
  take her journey at the last minute and was unable to make a
  reservation? In that case, the Flood-Porters and the Todhunters
  could not have secured coupés.</p>

  <p>Then was it meanness? Or was it because she wanted a special
  compartment at the end of the corridor, next to the doctor's
  carriage, where they would not be seen nor disturbed?</p>

  <p>Further&mdash;was it chance that the rest of the seats were
  occupied by local people whose destinies she swayed to a great
  extent?</p>

  <p>The questions hung in the air while a cloud of fresh
  suspicions quivered into Iris' mind. It was an extraordinary fact
  that the blinds remained undrawn in the invalid's compartment.
  She was left on show&mdash;so to speak&mdash;to declare the
  goods. Was that to prepare the way for a version of the old
  strategy&mdash;to hide an object in some place where it was
  visible to every one?</p>

  <p>Only&mdash;what had poor little Miss Froy done? Hare was right
  when he declared that he was influenced mainly by the question of
  motive. As far as Iris could tell she had discharged her duties
  so faithfully that her august employer had personally thanked for
  her services rendered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Iris caught her breath with excitement.</p>

  <p>"That was why," she whispered.</p>

  <p>The personage was supposed to be in his hunting-lodge at the
  time of the murder. Yet Miss Froy, by tactlessly lying awake, had
  surprised him coming from the one and only bathroom, where
  presumably he had been washing before he flitted.</p>

  <p>She had destroyed his alibi.</p>

  <p>Her knowledge would be a positive danger in view of the fact
  that she was returning to teach the children of the Red leader.
  Every one knew that she was a confirmed gossip and rattle. She
  would be proud of the personage's confidence and advertise it.
  And, as a British subject&mdash;with no axe to grind&mdash;her
  testimony would have weight against a mass of interested
  evidence.</p>

  <p>When the personage shook hands so graciously with her, he was
  sealing her doom.</p>

  <p>Iris pictured the hurried family conference at dawn&mdash;the
  hasty summons to the necessary confederates. Telephones would be
  humming with secret messages. In view of the urgency, it followed
  of necessity that Miss Froy's suppression could not be the
  perfect crime.</p>

  <p>She tried to control the gallop of her imagination.</p>

  <p>"Maximilian-Max"&mdash;she had not forgotten his name, since
  "Hare was too long"&mdash;"spun me a yarn. He was stretching the
  facts to make them fit in. Perhaps I'm doing the same. It's
  futile to palpitate about some one who may not exist. After all,
  as they say, she may be only a delusion...I do wish I could be
  sure."</p>

  <p>Her wish was granted in a dramatic manner. The carriage had
  grown hot and the steam on the window was turning gradually to
  beads of moisture, which was beginning to trickle downwards.</p>

  <p>Iris followed the slow slide of one of these drops from the
  top to a grimy corner of uncleaned pane.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she gave a start as she noticed a tiny name which had
  been written on the smoked glass.</p>

  <p>Leaning over she was able to decipher the signature. It was
  "Winifred Froy."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27" name="ch27">XXVII. &mdash; THE ACID
  TEST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IRIS stared at the name, hardly able to believe
  that her eyes were not playing her a trick. The tiny neat
  handwriting was round and unformed as that of a schoolgirl, and
  suggested the character of the little governess&mdash;half-prim
  adult, and half-arrested youth.</p>

  <p>It was proof positive that Miss Froy had sat recently in the
  corner seat. Iris vaguely remembered that she was knitting when
  she first entered the carriage. When she scrawled her name on the
  grimy glass with the point of one of her pins, she was working
  off some of the gush of her holiday mood.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> was right, after all," thought Iris exultantly.</p>

  <p>It was an overwhelming relief to emerge from the fog of her
  nightmare. But her exhilaration was blotted out almost
  immediately by a sense of impending crisis.</p>

  <p>She was no longer fighting shadows&mdash;but facing actual
  danger.</p>

  <p>A terrible fate awaited Miss Froy. She was the only person on
  the train who realised the peril. And time was slipping
  remorselessly away. A glance at her watch showed that it was ten
  minutes past nine. In less than an hour they would arrive at
  Trieste.</p>

  <p>Trieste now assumed a terrible significance. It was the place
  of execution.</p>

  <p>The train was rushing at tremendous speed, in a drive to make
  up lost time. It rattled and shrieked as it swung round the
  curves&mdash;shaking the carriages as though it reeked nothing of
  its human load. Iris felt that they were in the grip of an
  insensate maddened force, which, itself, was a victim to a
  relentless system.</p>

  <p>The driver would be fined for every minute over the scheduled
  time of arrival.</p>

  <p>The sense of urgency made Iris spring up from her seat, only
  to stagger back again at a sudden wave of faintness. She felt a
  knocking inside her head and stabbing pains behind her eyeballs,
  as the result of her unguarded movement. With a vague hope that
  it might act as an opiate she lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>A babel of voices in the corridor told her that the passengers
  were returning from dinner. The family party, with the blonde,
  came first. They were all in excellent spirits after their meal
  and took no notice of Iris, who glowered at them from her corner.
  She resented their passive conspiracy, even though they were
  ignorant of any threat to Miss Froy, and were pleased only to be
  of some slight service to the baroness.</p>

  <p>They were followed by the woman who wore Miss Froy's tweed
  suit and feathered hat. At the sight of the impostor, Iris'
  temperature rushed up again as she asked herself whether this
  were actually the second nursing-sister whom she had met in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Both had dull black eyes, a sallow skin, and bad teeth; but
  the peasants in the railway waiting-room had looked much the
  same. As it was impossible to reach any conclusion, Iris rose and
  dashed out into the corridor.</p>

  <p>She was strung up to action and intended to storm the next
  carriage. But blocking her way and almost filling the narrow
  space was the gigantic black figure of the baroness. As she
  towered above her, Iris realised that she was bottled up in the
  danger-zone of the train&mdash;away from every one she knew.</p>

  <p>She felt suddenly helpless and afraid as she looked away from
  the grim face to the shrieking darkness rushing past the window.
  The maniac shrieks of the engine and the frantic shaking of the
  train increased her sense of nightmare. Once again her knees
  began to shake and she had a terrible fear that she was going to
  faint.</p>

  <p>Her horror of becoming insensible and so being at their mercy
  made her fight the dizziness with every ounce of her strength.
  Licking her dry lips, she managed to speak to the baroness.</p>

  <p>"Let me pass, please."</p>

  <p>Instead of giving way, the baroness looked at her twitching
  face.</p>

  <p>"You are in pain," she said. "That is not good, for you are
  young and you travel without friends. I will ask the nurse here
  for a tablet to relieve your head."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," said Iris firmly. "Please, will you stand on
  one side?"</p>

  <p>The baroness took no notice of her request, or of her refusal.
  Instead, she shouted some imperative command which brought the
  callous-faced nurse to the doorway of the invalid's carriage.
  Iris noticed sub-consciously that the baroness' words did not
  conform to a conventional request, but were a peremptory order
  for prompt action.</p>

  <p>The glass of the patient's window was also growing steamy from
  heat, but Iris tried to look inside. The still form laid out on
  the seat appeared to have no face&mdash;only a white blur.</p>

  <p>As she asked herself what lay underneath the bandages, the
  nurse noticed her interest. She pounced forward and gripped the
  girl's arm, as though to pull her inside.</p>

  <p>Iris looked up at the brutal mouth, the dark shading round the
  lips and the muscular fingers, which were covered with short
  black hairs.</p>

  <p>"It is a man," she thought.</p>

  <p>Terror urged her to an elemental action of self-defence. She
  was scarcely conscious of what she did as she pressed the end of
  her smouldering cigarette against the back of the woman's hand.
  Taken by surprise, she relaxed her grip with what sounded like an
  oath.</p>

  <p>In that instant Iris pushed past the baroness and dashed down
  the corridor, fighting her way against the stream of returning
  diners. Although they opposed her advance, she was glad of their
  presence, because they formed a barrier between her and the
  baroness.</p>

  <p>As her terror waned, she began to realise that every one in
  the train seemed to be laughing at her. The guard openly sneered
  as he twisted his little black spiked moustache. There was a
  white flash of teeth and hoots of smothered laughter. The
  passengers evidently considered her slightly mad and were amused
  by a funny spectacle.</p>

  <p>Their derision made Iris aware of the situation. She felt
  self-conscious and ashamed as though she were in an unclothed
  kind of dream.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, what have I done?" she asked herself. "That nurse
  only offered me some aspirin, or something. And I burned her
  wrist. If they're really on the level, they will think me
  mad."</p>

  <p>Then her terror flared up again as the thought of Miss
  Froy.</p>

  <p>"They won't listen to me. But I must make them understand
  about her...This train seems a mile long. I'll never get
  there...Faces. Grinning faces...Miss Froy. I must be in
  time."</p>

  <p>She seemed imprisoned in some horrible nightmare, where her
  limbs were weighted with lead and refused to obey her will. The
  passengers blocked her way, so that she appeared to recede two
  steps where she advanced one. To her distorted imagination, the
  faces of these strangers were caricatures of
  humanity&mdash;blank, insensible and heartless. While Miss Froy
  was going to be murdered, no one cared for anything but
  dinner.</p>

  <p>After an age-long struggle through several sections of the
  train&mdash;when the connecting-passages turned to clanking iron
  concertinas, which tried to catch her and press her to
  death&mdash;she reached the restaurant-car. As she heard the
  clink of china and the hum of voices, her brain-storm passed and
  she lingered in the entrance&mdash;her returning sense of
  convention at war with elemental fear and horror.</p>

  <p>Soup was being served, and the diners were spooning it up
  vigorously, for they had been waiting a long time for their meal.
  In her lucid interval, Iris realised the hopeless prospect of
  trying to convince hungry men who had only just begun their
  dinner.</p>

  <p>Once again she ran the gauntlet of faces as she reeled down
  the gangway. Two waiters, whispering to one another, tittered,
  and she felt sure that they were sneering at her.</p>

  <p>The professor, who shared a table with Hare, saw her first,
  and an expression of apprehension flitted across his long face.
  He was chatting to the doctor, who had lingered over his coffee
  and liqueur, since the places for the second dinner were not all
  filled.</p>

  <p>Iris felt chilled by her reception when they all stared at her
  in silence. Even Hare's eyes held no welcome, as he watched her
  with a worried frown.</p>

  <p>In desperation she appealed to the professor.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake go on with your soup. Don't stop&mdash;but
  please listen. This is of deadly importance. I know there is a
  Miss Froy. I know there's a conspiracy against her. And I know
  why."</p>

  <p>The professor gave a resigned shrug as he continued drinking
  his soup. As Iris poured out her incoherent story, she was
  herself appalled by the weakness of her arguments. Before she
  finished she despaired of convincing him. He listened in stony
  silence, and was obviously absorbed by the exact proportion of
  salt to add to his soup.</p>

  <p>At the end of the tale he raised his brows interrogatively as
  he glanced at the doctor, who broke into some rapid explanation.
  Watching their faces with anxious eyes, Iris could tell that Hare
  was disturbed by what was said, for he cut into the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"That's not her yarn. It's mine. I spun it for a lark, and the
  poor kid sucked it in. So, if any one's loopy, it's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off, suddenly aware of what he had revealed. But Iris
  was too distraught to notice implications.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come now?" she entreated the professor.</p>

  <p>He looked at his empty plate which the waiter had placed in
  readiness for the fish course.</p>

  <p>"Can't it wait until after dinner?" he asked wearily.</p>

  <p>"Wait? Won't you understand. It's deadly, terribly urgent.
  When we reach Trieste it will be too late."</p>

  <p>Again the professor mutely consulted the doctor, who stared
  fixedly at Iris as though he were trying to hypnotise her. When
  at last he spoke, it was in English for her benefit.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we had better come at once to see my patient. I'm
  sorry that your dinner should be spoiled, professor. But the
  young lady is in a very highly-strung condition. It may
  be&mdash;safer&mdash;to try and reassure her."</p>

  <p>Wearing the expression of a martyr to his sense of justice,
  the professor unfolded himself from his seat. Once again the
  little procession staggered in single file down the corridors of
  the reeling train. As they neared the end, Hare turned and spoke
  to Iris in a fierce whisper.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a blasted fool and start anything."</p>

  <p>Her heart sank as she realised that his advice was too late.
  The nursing-sister was already displaying her hand for the
  benefit of the doctor and the professor. Iris noticed vaguely
  that she had wound a handkerchief around her wrist as though she
  wished to conceal it from too close a scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Then the doctor turned to her and spoke in soothing syrupy
  accents.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, wasn't it rather&mdash;impetuous&mdash;to
  burn my poor nurse? And all because she offered you a harmless
  tablet to relieve the pain of your head...See, professor, how her
  face twitches."</p>

  <p>Iris shrank as he touched her forehead with a cold forefinger
  to illustrate his meaning.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she remembered that when one is losing a defensive
  game, the only hope is to attack. Plucking up her courage, she
  managed to steady her voice.</p>

  <p>"I cannot be sorry enough about the burn. It's no excuse to
  say I was hysterical. But there was some excuse for my being so.
  There is so much that I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>The doctor accepted her challenge.</p>

  <p>"Such as&mdash;?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, the professor tells me you offered to take me to a
  nursing home at Trieste."</p>

  <p>"The offer is still open."</p>

  <p>"Yet you are supposed to be rushing a patient to hospital for
  a dangerous operation. How could you possibly bother yourself
  with a complete stranger?...It makes one wonder exactly how
  serious her injuries are. Or if she has any at all."</p>

  <p>The doctor stroked his beard.</p>

  <p>"My offer was made merely to relieve the professor of an
  unwelcome responsibility, which is in my line and not in his. But
  I am afraid that you exaggerate your own importance. My intention
  was to give you a seat in the ambulance which took us to the
  hospital. After we had gone inside with our patient, the driver
  would follow his instructions and drive you to some recommended
  nursing home. It was not for professional service&mdash;but
  merely to give you a good night's rest, so that you could
  continue your journey on the following day."</p>

  <p>The proposal sounded so reasonable that Iris could only fall
  back on her second question.</p>

  <p>"Where is the other nurse?"</p>

  <p>The doctor paused perceptibly before his reply.</p>

  <p>"There is only one nurse."</p>

  <p>As she looked at his impassive face, further screened by his
  black spade-beard, Iris knew instinctively that it was useless to
  protest. The result would be the same&mdash;denials on every
  side. No one but herself would have seen that second nurse. Just
  as no one would accept Miss Froy's signature as
  genuine&mdash;supposing that it had not been already destroyed by
  condensation.</p>

  <p>The doctor spoke to the professor.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to detain you further," he said, "but here is a
  young lady who believes very terrible things. We must try to
  convince her of her <i>delusions</i>."</p>

  <p>He crossed to the shrouded form of his patient and pulled up a
  corner of one of the rugs, displaying a neat pair of legs.</p>

  <p>"Can you identify these stockings or these boots?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Iris shook her head as she looked at the thick silk stockings
  and regulation brown calf single-strap shoes.</p>

  <p>"You know I can't," she said. "But you might have better luck
  if you would raise just one bandage and let me see her face."</p>

  <p>The doctor grimaced with horror.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said, "I see you do not understand. I must tell you
  something that is not pretty. Listen." He touched the swathed
  forehead with a butterfly flick of his fingertips. "There is no
  face here at all. <i>No face.</i> Only lumps of raw flesh.
  Perhaps we shall make quite another face, if we are lucky. We
  shall see."</p>

  <p>His fingers moved on and hovered for a second over the bandage
  which covered the eyes of the figure.</p>

  <p>"We await the oculist's verdict on these," he said. "Till
  then, we dare not expose them to a flicker of light. It may be
  total blindness, for one eye is but pulp. But science can work
  marvels."</p>

  <p>He smiled at Iris and continued.</p>

  <p>"But most terrible of all is the injury to the brain. I will
  not describe it, for already you look sick. First of all we must
  attend to that. Afterwards&mdash;the rest, if the patient still
  lives."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you," Iris told him. "It's all lies."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the doctor smoothly, "you can convince
  yourself. You have only to tear one little strip of plaster from
  the face, to see...But if you do, I warn you that bleeding will
  start again and the patient will die instantly from shock...You
  will be charged with murder and you will be hanged...But since
  you are so sure of the face which is under these bandages, you
  will not hesitate...<i>Will</i> you tear off this strip?"</p>

  <p>Iris felt Hare's fingers closing over her arm, as she
  hesitated. Her instinct told her that the doctor was putting up a
  bluff, and that she ought to grasp at even the hundredth chance
  to save Miss Froy's life.</p>

  <p>Yet the doctor had done his work too well. The thought of that
  mutilated face spouting fountains of blood made her shrink back.
  Afterwards? The rope&mdash;or Broadmoor for life. It was too
  horrible a prospect to contemplate.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Ah," sneered the doctor, "you talk, but you are not so
  brave."</p>

  <p>For the first time it struck Iris that he had never intended
  to risk his patient. Had he done so, he would have committed
  professional suicide. Both he and the nurse were on guard, to
  anticipate her movements.</p>

  <p>All the same, he had some ulterior object in view, for he
  seemed disappointed.</p>

  <p>At the time Iris was too sick at heart over her own cowardice
  to question further. She realised that she had two enemies in the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>The doctor&mdash;and herself.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28" name="ch28">XXVIII. &mdash; RAISE YOUR
  HAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IRIS started from her daze to realise that the
  professor was talking of dinner.</p>

  <p>"If you would hurry back to the dining-car, Hare," he said
  hopefully, "you might explain to the waiter that we've missed the
  fish course."</p>

  <p>"He'd only say it was 'off,'" Hare told him. "They've got to
  rush the second dinner through before we make Trieste."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut." The professor clicked. "In that case, we had
  better return at once. Perhaps you would go on ahead and order
  extra portions of meat, since we've gone without our fish."</p>

  <p>"Not their fault. We walked out on the fish. But I'll see what
  can be done about it."</p>

  <p>Hare checked himself and turned to Iris rather doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She gave an hysterical laugh, for it had just struck her that
  although the professor was confident of his ability to conduct
  her investigation, he could not risk his linguistic talent where
  vital interests were concerned.</p>

  <p>"Go back, for pity's sake," she said. "Nothing matters but
  dinner, does it?"</p>

  <p>The professor, whose lean face had brightened at the prospect
  of food, resented her reproach. Although famished, he felt he
  must defend his own reputation for meticulous justice.</p>

  <p>"Are you being quite fair?" he asked. "We've paid a stiff
  price for a meal, so we are entitled to claim&mdash;at
  least&mdash;a portion of it. And you must admit we have not
  spared time or convenience in trying to convince you of your
  mistake."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, but she was oppressed by a weight of
  hopelessness. There seemed nothing more to be done to help Miss
  Froy. Any attempt at interference would only expose her to the
  risk of reprisal.</p>

  <p>It was not cowardice alone that made her fear the power of the
  doctor, but common sense. Since she was the sole person on the
  train who believed in Miss Froy's existence, it stood to reason
  that she could be of use to her only if she were a free
  agent.</p>

  <p>Her one chance lay in convincing the professor that there was
  a real need of further investigation. Although she disliked him,
  he possessed those qualities which counted in such a crisis. He
  was pig-headed, coolly humane, and rigidly just. If he were
  morally certain that he was right, nothing could shake him, and
  he would plug away at his objective in face of all
  opposition.</p>

  <p>It was bad luck that&mdash;at the moment&mdash;he was
  concentrating on his dinner.</p>

  <p>Her curdled brain cleared just as he was about to leave the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>"Professor," she said, "if I'm right, when you get back to
  England you'll read about a missing Englishwoman&mdash;Miss Froy.
  When you do, it will be too late to save her. Won't it haunt you
  for the rest of your life, that you wouldn't listen to me
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I might regret it," admitted the professor, "only the
  occasion is not likely to arise."</p>

  <p>"But if you'll only do something&mdash;a very little
  thing&mdash;later you won't have to be sorry at all. And you
  won't have to cut short your dinner."</p>

  <p>"What is it that you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Go with the doctor to the Trieste hospital and watch while a
  bandage or strip of plaster is removed. Just enough to show you
  that there is genuine injury."</p>

  <p>Although the professor was staggered by the suggestion, he
  considered it slowly with habitual conscientiousness. It
  encouraged Iris to follow up her advantage with a fresh
  argument.</p>

  <p>"You must admit, I can do nothing. I'm not a lunatic and it
  might mean manslaughter. Besides, the doctor wouldn't let me. So
  it boils down to this. His precious test means nothing at
  all."</p>

  <p>At her words, the first distrust of the doctor entered the
  professor's mind. It was visible in his puckered face and
  drumming fingers. He always counted the cost before he
  entertained any project, although it was typical of his high
  sense of duty that it could not deter him.</p>

  <p>In this case the drawbacks were numerous, the chief of which
  was finance. Although he was no spendthrift, his standard of
  living at Cambridge was only covered by his salary, and he had to
  encroach on his capital for holidays. To get a complete mental
  change he went away at least three times a year, so he had to
  practise economy.</p>

  <p>As the most expensive part of this special trip was the long
  railway journey, he had booked through one of the cheaper tourist
  agencies which specialised in cut-prices. Therefore, his ticket
  would not admit his breaking the journey anywhere.</p>

  <p>To make matters more difficult he was short of cash, since his
  dislike of communal travel had made him yield to the temptation
  of sharing a coupé with Hare on the return journey.</p>

  <p>There was another and more urgent reason why he should not
  stop at Trieste for the night. Delay involved the sacrifice of a
  cherished engagement. He had been invited to spend the following
  week-end with an elderly peer&mdash;an intellectual
  recluse&mdash;who lived in a remote corner of Wales. If he
  reached England on Saturday, instead of Friday, it would be too
  late.</p>

  <p>The doctor watched him closely as he frowned and tapped his
  cheek-bones.</p>

  <p>"Is it not convenient for you to stop at Trieste?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Definitely inconvenient."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry. Because, in my own interest, I must beg of you to
  do what this young lady asks."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the professor, incensed by this double assault on
  his week-end.</p>

  <p>"Because I am growing convinced that there must be some reason
  for this poor young lady's distress. It is always 'Miss Froy.' Is
  that a common name in England, like 'Smith?'"</p>

  <p>"It is not familiar to me."</p>

  <p>"But she had heard it before&mdash;and in connection with some
  terrible experience. I do not know what has happened. But I think
  that there really is a lady called 'Miss Froy,' and that some
  harm has happened to her. I think, too, that this poor young lady
  knew, but the shock has driven away all memory."</p>

  <p>"Absurd," interrupted Iris. "I won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," whispered Hare fiercely.</p>

  <p>He had listened with close attention, for he was beginning to
  wonder whether the doctor had not found the true explanation of
  Iris' delusion. She had been unconscious until just before she
  managed to catch the train. Although the explanation was
  sunstroke, it might have been supplied through the agency of some
  interested person, who wanted to confuse her recollection.</p>

  <p>"You will understand," went on the doctor, "that I do not wish
  to be under any suspicion, if&mdash;later&mdash;a lady might be
  declared missing."</p>

  <p>"It's a preposterous idea," said the professor. "Besides, the
  hospital authorities would back you up."</p>

  <p>"But how am I to prove that it is this patient I bring to
  them, and not some substitute? But if you, professor, would
  accompany me to the hospital and wait for the surgeon's initial
  examination, there can be no further question. It is your high
  reputation that I crave for my protection."</p>

  <p>The professor smiled bleakly, for he was very hungry. Although
  he was an excellent bridge player, he had no knowledge of poker.
  Consequently the doctor's offer seemed to him proof positive that
  there was not even the flimsiest foundation for Iris' fantastic
  theory.</p>

  <p>"I think you are carrying professional caution too far," he
  said. "Miss Carr"&mdash;unlike Hare, he was used to memorising
  names&mdash;"has declared that she went to the dining-car with
  one lady whom she called 'Miss Froy'&mdash;and that lady has
  since been identified as a Miss Kummer...She is not well, which
  accounts for her mistake...In the circumstances, there is no
  shred of evidence that the real Miss Froy&mdash;if there is such
  a person&mdash;is on the train at all."</p>

  <p>"Then, in case of future trouble, may I apply to you to
  support any statement I might make?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I will give you my card."</p>

  <p>The professor wheeled round and turned dinnerwards.</p>

  <p>Hare divined that Iris was on the verge of an explosion.</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had managed to restrain her by the warning
  pressure of his hand on her arm, but she was at the end of her
  patience.</p>

  <p>"Don't throw a scene," he implored. "It's no good. Come back
  to the coop."</p>

  <p>Instead of obeying she raised her voice.</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy. Can you hear me? Hold up your hand if you
  can."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29" name="ch29">XXIX. &mdash; TRIESTE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS FROY heard her. She held up her hand.</p>

  <p>Although she was blinded by her bandage, she had recognised
  Iris' voice among a murmur of other sounds. In a confused fashion
  she realised that people were talking; but their tones were
  blurred and broken, as though they were far away&mdash;giving the
  impression of an imperfect long-distance call.</p>

  <p>She tried to speak to them, but could not because of her gag.
  Once before she had contrived to move it partially, with frenzied
  pressure&mdash;remembering the while how her father used to tease
  her about the power of her tongue. She put every ounce of
  strength into that cry for help, but it was an uncouth incoherent
  sound, like an animal in pain.</p>

  <p>No one heard her&mdash;and her captors had wedged the gag
  tighter, increasing her discomfort. Her arms were bound to her
  body above the elbows, and her legs were tied together at the
  ankles by a surgical bandage. The doctor made no attempt to hide
  it when he exposed her shoes and stockings for identification. He
  knew that among such a profusion of strappings, one more or less
  would never be remarked.</p>

  <p>However, her hands were free from the wrists, because the
  supply of bindings had given out, and&mdash;in any
  case&mdash;they were powerless to do more than wave feebly. Miss
  Froy's heart fluttered with joy as she told herself that her
  clever girl knew that an instantaneous response to her appeal,
  however slight, would show that the patient recognised her name
  and was giving proof of identity.</p>

  <p>So she spread out her fingers&mdash;fan-wise&mdash;and flapped
  them in the air in a pathetic S.O.S.</p>

  <p>Then once again her mind, which she was unable to control,
  slid away. It was cobwebbed and smeared from drugs, but every now
  and again a corner would clear, like the transparent red stains
  of juice that veins the scum of boiling jam. In these lucid
  moments a whirl of memories returned, but in the end her mind
  always went back to that first moment of shock.</p>

  <p>It was incredible&mdash;monstrous. She had been sitting in her
  compartment when the doctor had entered and asked if any one
  would help him raise his patient. He explained that the nurse had
  gone away for a few minutes and the poor creature in his charge
  had grown restless, as though she were uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>It was second-nature to Miss Froy to respond. She was not only
  always ready to be of service, but she was also anxious to see
  the crash casualty at closed quarters, besides learning perhaps
  more about the accident. It would be something with which to
  thrill the family when she related her adventures on Friday
  night.</p>

  <p>When they entered the patient's compartment the doctor asked
  her to raise the head while he lifted the body. It was with
  specially deep sympathy that she bent over the prostrate form,
  because she was reminded of the contrast between them.</p>

  <p>"She's smashed," she thought, "and I'm well and happy. I'm
  going home."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a long pair of white linen-clad arms shot out and
  clutched her throat.</p>

  <p>The helpless patient was gripping her windpipe in a merciless
  grip. In that appalling moment she remembered a Grand Guignol
  horror, when an electrified corpse had strangled the man who had
  galvanised it to synthetic life. Then the pressure tightened,
  lights flashed under her eyelids, and she knew no more.</p>

  <p>For some time the eclipse had been total. Then, gradually
  there were infinitesimal rifts in the darkness of her senses. She
  became conscious that she was trussed, gagged and blinded, while
  muffled voices discussed her fate.</p>

  <p>It was not a cheerful prospect. Although she was ignorant of
  her crime, she had an inkling of her sentence. It was connected
  with an ambulance which would meet them at Trieste. But it would
  take her to no hospital.</p>

  <p>Yet in spite of cramp and thirst, of bodily anguish and mental
  torment, she never gave up hope.</p>

  <p>It was said in the family that she followed Aunt Jane. In her
  lifetime, this Victorian lady had wanted a talking-doll, a
  tricycle, an operatic career, a husband, a legacy. She got none
  of these things, but she never discarded a single wish, nor
  doubted that each would be granted&mdash;in the end.</p>

  <p>When the end came, she was seventy-seven and a pensioner on
  family charity; yet she closed her eyes with as lively a faith in
  the talking-doll as in the legacy which would grant her a
  leisured life and a dignified death.</p>

  <p>Aunt Jane helps to explain why Miss Froy remained tolerably
  calm in the face of each fresh disappointment. Mercifully,
  however, her clear moments were of brief duration. Most of the
  time she was in a drugged dream, when she was for ever trying to
  get home.</p>

  <p>She always managed to reach the gate and saw the lighted
  garden path with its exaggerated hollows&mdash;when a displaced
  pebble revealed a pit. The turf borders and the pink and purple
  Chinese asters were unnaturally vivid in the lamplight, while the
  pungent scent of early chrysanthemums hung on the frosty air.</p>

  <p>But although she was so near that she could see the cracked
  red tile in the passage, she knew that something was wrong, and
  that she would never reach the door...It was when she was
  struggling out of one of these tantalising visions, that she
  heard Iris calling her name and telling her to hold up her
  hand.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately she did not know that there was a bad block in
  her system of communication. None of the channels were clear, so
  that her brain did not register the message from her ears until
  after the doctor&mdash;in a state of indignant horror&mdash;had
  literally swept his visitors out into the corridor. Even after
  that, some time elapsed before her nerve-centres were linked up
  with the intelligence department, and by then it was too
  late.</p>

  <p>The blinds had all been drawn down, so there was no one
  besides the nurse to witness the futile signal of her fluttering
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Outside the door the doctor wiped his face in his
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"That was a terrible thing to do," he said, his voice
  vibrating with passion. "I was wrong to let you in at all. But I
  never dreamed you would be so imbecile as to try and injure my
  poor patient."</p>

  <p>As Iris shrank involuntarily before his rage, he appealed to
  the professor.</p>

  <p>"You can understand, professor, that absolute quiet is
  essential for my patient. The grave injury to the
  head&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How can she get quiet on a railway journey?" broke in Iris,
  as the engine plunged into a tunnel with an earsplitting
  yell.</p>

  <p>"That is something quite different," explained the doctor.
  "One can sleep through traffic. It is the slight unaccustomed
  sound which wakens one from sleep. If she had heard you she might
  have been called back, while I am doing my utmost&mdash;in
  mercy&mdash;to keep her unconscious."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," the professor assured him. "And I regret
  this has happened." His voice was glacial as he spoke to Iris.
  "You had better get back to your carriage, Miss Carr."</p>

  <p>"Yes, come on," urged Hare.</p>

  <p>Iris felt that they were all against her. In sudden defiance
  she launched a lone offensive.</p>

  <p>"Directly we reach Trieste I am going to the British Embassy,"
  she told them.</p>

  <p>They were brave words, but her head was swimming and her knees
  shook so violently that she felt incapable of carrying out her
  threat. All the same, her intentions filled her with an illusion
  of power. Then Hare tackled her in his old international form and
  carried her along the corridors with the impetus of a tidal-bore,
  while the professor plodded in the rear.</p>

  <p>"My only hope is we shall get some sort of a dinner," was his
  parting remark to the doctor.</p>

  <p>Iris was too bewildered by what had happened to resist Hare's
  high-handed treatment. She could not understand why there had
  been no response to her cry. It shook her confidence and made her
  feel that her moral cowardice in failing to expose the mystery
  patient was justified.</p>

  <p>Yet even if she were a genuine accident case, the danger which
  threatened Miss Froy was not dormant. When she was back in the
  coupé she presented Hare with an ultimatum.</p>

  <p>"Are you with me or against me? Are you stopping at
  Trieste?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Hare firmly. "Neither are you."</p>

  <p>"I see. Then you didn't mean what you said about liking
  me&mdash;and all that."</p>

  <p>"I certainly meant&mdash;all that."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you don't come with me to the Embassy, I'm through
  with you."</p>

  <p>Hare tugged at his collar miserably.</p>

  <p>"Can't you realise I'm your only friend?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If you were a friend you'd prove it."</p>

  <p>"Wish I could, only I haven't the spunk. As your best friend,
  I ought to knock you out, so that you'd stay put for the next
  twenty-four hours, and rest your poor old head."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hate you," stormed Iris. "For heaven's sake, go
  away."</p>

  <p>In the next compartment the Misses Flood-Porter overheard
  scraps of the dialogue.</p>

  <p>"That girl certainly contrives to get some excitement out of a
  railway journey," remarked the elder sister astringently.</p>

  <p>While the young people were quarrelling about her, Miss Froy
  was lying rigid, with still hands. It had gradually dawned upon
  her that she had no audience, so her demonstration was wasted.
  However, she had one crumb of comfort when Iris mentioned
  appealing to the British Consul. She had heard that cry of
  defiance through the closed door.</p>

  <p>Presently she realised that the hint had not been wasted.
  There was a low rumbling conference inside the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Trieste," remarked a masculine voice. It belonged to the
  doctor's chauffeur, who was wearing the incongruous uniform of a
  nursing-sister. "What now?"</p>

  <p>"We must waste no time at Trieste," replied the doctor. "We
  shall have to drive all night, like hell, to get back to
  protection."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;where will you dump the body now?"</p>

  <p>The doctor mentioned a place.</p>

  <p>"It is on our road," he explained. "The wharf is
  deserted&mdash;and the eels swarm."</p>

  <p>"Good. They will be hungry. Very soon there will be no face to
  tell tales, if it should be found later...Will you dump the
  clothes and baggage there too?"</p>

  <p>"Fool. They would be a certain mark of identification there.
  No, we take them with us in the car. You will incinerate them
  without delay directly we get back."</p>

  <p>Although her brain was so misty, some vibration of her senses
  made Miss Froy aware that they were talking about her. She
  shuddered instinctively at the thought of black stagnant water,
  thick with mud and scummed with refuse. She had such a violent
  dislike to corruption.</p>

  <p>But she missed the real implication.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur went on to anticipate difficulties.</p>

  <p>"What if any one makes inquiries at the Trieste
  hospitals?"</p>

  <p>"We shall explain that the patient died in transit."</p>

  <p>"But if they demand to see the corpse?"</p>

  <p>"They will see it. There will be no difficulty about that,
  once we are back. The mortuary will provide me with a female
  corpse which I will mutilate."</p>

  <p>"Hum. I wish I was safely at home. There is still that
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Yes," remarked the doctor, "it is extraordinary how the
  English will regard themselves as the policemen of the world.
  Even a girl has the habit. But it is a mistake to think them a
  stupid nation. That professor has a good brain, and he is no
  fool...But luckily, he is honourable, and believes that all the
  world must be honourable, too. He will support all I say."</p>

  <p>"Still, I wish I was back," harped the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"The risk is great," his employer reminded him. "So, also, is
  the reward."</p>

  <p>The drone of masculine voices which drummed against Miss
  Froy's semi-sealed ears&mdash;like the hum of a spinning
  wheel&mdash;ceased. The chauffeur thought of the garage he would
  buy, while the doctor planned to retire from practice.</p>

  <p>He did not relish his present commission, but the ruling
  family claimed his loyalty and self-interest forbade
  disobedience. Directly the baroness had sent for him, privately,
  by night, he had evolved the best scheme he could devise on the
  spur of the moment, to clear an obstacle in the illustrious
  pathway.</p>

  <p>He knew why he had been chosen, for he, himself, would not use
  a delicate surgical instrument to cut a tarry string. His
  reputation was smutted because of recent mishaps at the local
  hospital. His scientific curiosity was keener than his wish to
  exterminate disease, and he was under suspicion of having
  prolonged operations unduly, and at the expense of life.</p>

  <p>From the beginning the venture had been unlucky, because of
  the interference of the English girl. But for her, the little
  plan would have worked perfectly, by reason of its simplicity,
  and the small number of confederates. He knew that he and his
  chauffeur would take their lives in their hands when they
  scorched homewards through dangerous passes, rounding dizzy
  precipices on one wheel, in their effort to race the express back
  to their native territory.</p>

  <p>But once they were back, every emergency would be forestalled.
  An adequate explanation would be forthcoming to any inquiry. No
  one would have any awkward knowledge to disclose and every wire
  that connected the dead patient with Miss Froy would be cut.</p>

  <p>"Will you dump the English girl in the sewer, too?" asked the
  chauffeur suddenly.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the doctor. "Further complication would be
  dangerous. But when we reach Trieste she will not be in a
  position to make further trouble for us."</p>

  <p>Miss Froy heard his words and, for the first time, her
  optimism failed her. With a wave of agonised longing she thought
  of the family at home, for she had sent them her timetable, and
  she guessed they would be tracing it on the map.</p>

  <p>True to her forecast, at that moment they were thinking of
  her. They had done their best to fight their unusual depression,
  for they had lighted a fire&mdash;composed principally of fir-
  cones&mdash;and had been guilty of an extravagant
  supper&mdash;scrambled eggs.</p>

  <p>Sock lay on the rug watching the flames. In spite of the
  welcome warmth, he was still subdued after his disappointment,
  for he had rushed off against orders to meet the train, with a
  hope new-born.</p>

  <p>Mr. Froy looked at his wife and noticed that the under-lip of
  her small firm mouth was pendulous and that she sagged in her
  chair. For the first time he realised that she was his senior,
  and that he, too, had grown old.</p>

  <p>Then he glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Winsome's nearly come to the end of her first stage
  homewards," he told his wife. "She'll soon reach Trieste."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy passed the information on to the dog.</p>

  <p>"Sock, the little mistress is really on her way home now.
  Every minute she is coming nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;nearer. In
  another half-hour she'll be at Trieste."</p>

  <p>Trieste.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30" name="ch30">XXX. &mdash; RECANTATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE waiter managed to salvage some dinner for
  the professor and Hare, who ate through the courses in silence.
  As they were finishing their cheese and biscuits, the doctor
  entered the dining-car and seated himself at their table.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to disturb you," he said, "but I want a little
  conference about the young English lady."</p>

  <p>The professor stifled an exclamation, for he feared that Iris
  had broken out in some fresh indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"Coffee, please," he said to the waiter.
  "Black...Well&mdash;what is the trouble <i>now</i>?"</p>

  <p>"As a medical man I find myself faced with a responsibility,"
  explained the doctor. "The lady is in a dangerous mental
  state."</p>

  <p>"What grounds have you for your conclusion?" asked the
  professor, who never accepted a statement without data.</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Surely it is obvious to the meanest intelligence that she is
  suffering from a delusion. She invents some one who is not here.
  But there are other signs. She is highly
  excitable&mdash;suspicious of every one&mdash;inclined to be
  violent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he noticed Hare's involuntary grimace, he broke off and
  turned to the younger man.</p>

  <p>"Pardon. Is the young lady your affianced?"</p>

  <p>"No," grunted Hare.</p>

  <p>"But perhaps a lover&mdash;or a dear friend? Yet it would not
  surprise me to hear that she has been very angry recently with
  you. Has she?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not really popular at present," admitted Hare.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the confidence, for it confirms my diagnosis.
  It is always a sign of mental malady when they turn upon those
  they love best."</p>

  <p>He could tell he had captured Hare's sympathy as he
  continued.</p>

  <p>"There is no real danger if we can take a precaution. It is
  essential at this stage that her brain should be rested. If she
  could have a long sleep, I am confident she will wake up quite
  well again. But if we let her persist in working herself up into
  a fever, the mental mischief may be&mdash;irreparable."</p>

  <p>"I think there is something in that, professor," agreed Hare.
  "It's exactly what I've been thinking myself."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" asked the professor cautiously.</p>

  <p>"I should suggest," replied the doctor, "that you persuade her
  to swallow a harmless sedative which I can give you."</p>

  <p>"She will object."</p>

  <p>"Then it should be given by force."</p>

  <p>"Impossible. We cannot control her wishes."</p>

  <p>"Then, perhaps, you could trick her into taking it?"</p>

  <p>As the professor remained mulishly silent, the doctor half
  rose from the table.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," he said, "that I have more than enough
  responsibility of my own to shoulder, with my patient. I only
  felt it my duty to warn you. We doctors are pledged to the
  service of humanity&mdash;whether we receive fees or no. But now
  that I have explained the position, I can leave the decision to
  you. My own conscience is clear."</p>

  <p>The doctor was on the point of departing with dignity, when
  Hare called him back.</p>

  <p>"Don't go, doctor. I feel the same as you about this. I've had
  personal experience of delusions, with concussion." He turned
  eagerly to the professor. "Can't we wangle it somehow?"</p>

  <p>The professor's long upper lip seemed to lengthen in his
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"I could not be a party to such a course," he said. "It would
  be gross interference with Miss Carr's personal liberty. She is a
  free agent."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;you'd prefer to remain 'good form' and see her go
  bughouse?" asked Hare indignantly.</p>

  <p>The professor smiled acidly.</p>

  <p>"My own impression is," he told them, "that there is not the
  slightest danger of that. I have had experience of such
  cases.</p>

  <p>"My work brings me into contact with neurotic young women. To
  my mind, Miss Carr is merely hysterical."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;what do you propose?" asked Hare.</p>

  <p>"I think a salutary shock will probably bring her to her
  senses."</p>

  <p>Reinforced by his meal, the professor felt master of the
  situation. He finished his coffee and liqueur, flicked a crumb
  from his waistcoat, and rose in a leisurely manner.</p>

  <p>"I will reason with Miss Carr," he said.</p>

  <p>He strolled out of the dining-car and lurched along the
  corridors. As he passed the coupé occupied by the Misses Flood-
  Porter, he was tempted to resign his mission and join them in a
  little chat. The ladies looked so composed and
  immaculate&mdash;for they were well in advance of their
  preparations for arrival at Trieste&mdash;that he was hopeful
  that further conversation would reveal some mutual friend.</p>

  <p>Resolute in his self-imposed duty, he entered his carriage and
  seated himself opposite to Iris. His first glance told him that
  she had been lighting cigarette after cigarette, only to throw
  them away, barely smoked. Although her action was merely a sign
  of nervous tension, he looked with distaste at the litter of
  spent matches on the floor and seats.</p>

  <p>"Will you take some advice offered in a friendly spirit?" he
  asked, speaking to her as though she were a fractious child.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Iris mutinously. "I want to hear the truth, for
  a change."</p>

  <p>"The truth may be a bit of a shock. But you've asked for it,
  so you shall have it...The doctor has just told me that, as a
  result of your sunstroke, you are&mdash;very slightly, and only
  temporarily&mdash;deranged."</p>

  <p>The professor honestly believed that he was dealing with a
  neurotic girl who was telling lies from a love of sensation, so
  he watched her reaction with complacent confidence. When he saw
  the horror in her eyes, he felt his experiment was justified.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;mad?" she asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, no. Nothing to be frightened of. But he is not
  happy about your safety as you are travelling alone. He may be
  forced to take steps to ensure it, unless you can manage to keep
  perfectly quiet."</p>

  <p>"What steps?" asked Iris. "Do you mean that nursing home? I
  should resist. No one can do anything to me against my will."</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances, violence would be most unwise. It would
  only confirm the doctor's fears. But I want to make the position
  quite clear to you. Listen."</p>

  <p>The professor sawed the air with his forefinger and spoke
  impressively.</p>

  <p>"You have only to keep calm and everything will be all right.
  No one will interfere with you in any way, unless you remind them
  of your existence. To be brutally frank, you've made yourself a
  public nuisance. It's got to stop."</p>

  <p>The professor was not so unhuman as he seemed. His own
  unpleasant experience with his infatuated student had prejudiced
  him against emotion, but he thought he was acting in Iris'
  interests.</p>

  <p>Therefore he could have no idea of the hell of fear into which
  he plunged her. She was white to her lips as she shrank into the
  corner of the carriage. She was afraid of him&mdash;afraid of
  every one in the train. Even Hare seemed to have entered into the
  conspiracy against her. The whole world appeared roped into a
  league that threatened her sanity.</p>

  <p>Lighting yet one more cigarette with shaking fingers, she
  tried to realise the position. It seemed clear that she had
  blundered into important issues and that, consequently, she had
  to be suppressed. The professor had been sent to bribe her with
  immunity in return for her silence.</p>

  <p>Even while she rejected compromise angrily, she had to face
  the cold truth. She had not a ghost of a chance to fight these
  influential people. If she persisted in her hopeless quest to
  find Miss Froy, the doctor would merely pull wires and whisk her
  away to some nursing home in Trieste.</p>

  <p>She remembered Miss Froy's tale of the woman who had been held
  in a private mental asylum. The same might happen to her. Any
  opposition on her part would be used as evidence against her
  sanity. They could keep her imprisoned and under the influence of
  drugs, until she really crashed under the strain.</p>

  <p>It would be some appreciable time before any one missed her.
  She was not expected in England, for she had not troubled to
  engage rooms at an hotel. Her friends would believe that she was
  still abroad. When at last her lawyers or the bank made
  inquiries, it would be too late. They would trace her to the
  nursing home, and arrive to find a lunatic.</p>

  <p>In her distraught state, she plunged herself into a morass of
  distorted fears and exaggerated perils. But although her reason
  was nearly submerged by a tidal wave of panic, one corner of her
  brain still functioned on common-sense lines.</p>

  <p>It convinced her that Miss Froy's rescue was an utterly
  hopeless proposition.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked the professor patiently, as she tossed away her
  unsmoked cigarette.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Iris thought of the familiar Calais-Dover
  express&mdash;the white cliffs&mdash;Victoria Station&mdash;with
  almost frantic longing. She felt homesick for England and the
  cheery casual crowd of her friends. Before her eyes, in letters
  of fire, flashed the familiar slogan&mdash;"SAFETY FIRST."</p>

  <p>"Well?" repeated the professor. "Have you come to your
  senses?"</p>

  <p>Utterly worn out and paralysed with fear, Iris slipped into
  the trough of lost hopes. She reminded herself that Miss Froy was
  merely a stranger whom she had tried to help. To persist merely
  meant a double&mdash;and useless&mdash;sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied dully.</p>

  <p>"You'll make no more scenes?" went on the professor.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Good...Now, will you admit to me that you invented Miss
  Froy?"</p>

  <p>Iris felt plunged in the hell of Judas Iscariot and all
  traitors as she made her denial.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I invented her. There's no Miss Froy."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31" name="ch31">XXXI. &mdash; A CUP OF SOUP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE doctor looked after the professor as he went
  from the dining-car.</p>

  <p>"That is a very clever man," he said dryly. "He would cure
  illness by a scolding. Yet he may be right. Indeed, for the first
  time in my career, I hope I shall be proved wrong."</p>

  <p>He watched Hare's frowning face closely and asked, "What is
  your opinion?"</p>

  <p>"I know he's making a damnable blunder," growled the young
  man.</p>

  <p>"'He that knows, and knows that he knows,'" quoted the doctor,
  "'he is wise'...Well&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you feel, perhaps, that the professor is cleverer than
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I feel nothing of the kind. Our lines are different."</p>

  <p>"Then probably you are not used to exert authority?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. I've only got to control hundreds of toughs&mdash;and
  some of them ready on the draw."</p>

  <p>"Then, frankly, I do not understand your hesitation. Unless,
  of course, you fear the young lady's anger when she discovers she
  has been tricked. She has what you call 'spirit,' and what I call
  'temper,' since I have a very sweet wife myself...Well, it is for
  you to decide whether you prefer the angry words of a sane woman
  to the gentle smile of an imbecile."</p>

  <p>"Don't rub it in," muttered Hare. "I've got to
  <i>think</i>."</p>

  <p>"There is not much time left," the doctor reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I know. But&mdash;it's the hell of a risk."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Here is my card. I will write a declaration on it
  that the drug is harmless, under penalty of heavy damages, should
  the lady be ill afterwards as a direct result...I will do more.
  You shall have a sample to take back to England, so that you may
  have it analysed."</p>

  <p>Hare pulled at his lip. He knew that the doctor's offer was
  fair, yet he could not shake off his distrust of the unknown.</p>

  <p>The doctor seemed to read his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said, "you hesitate because I am not Dr. Smith,
  of London, England. Yet, if you were in a strange city and had a
  raging toothache, you would seek relief from the first dentist.
  Remember, a man's name on a brass plate, with certain letters
  after it, is a profession's guarantee of good faith to the
  public."</p>

  <p>He let the argument sink in while Hare continued to maltreat
  his face and hair. Presently he glanced at his watch, and then
  thrust his wrist before the young man's eyes.</p>

  <p>"See the time. I must go back to my patient."</p>

  <p>Hare sprang up as though galvanised.</p>

  <p>"One minute, doctor. How could we give the stuff?"</p>

  <p>The doctor knew that the bridge had been crossed as he
  hastened to explain.</p>

  <p>"That poor young lady has had no dinner," he said
  reproachfully. "Surely you will bring her a small cup of soup,
  since there will be no opportunities on the Italian train, until
  they couple the breakfast-car."</p>

  <p>"Chump," exclaimed Hare, hitting his head. "I never thought
  that she'd be hungry...But if she is asleep, how will I manage
  changing trains at Trieste?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear sir, you must not expect miracles. You are too
  impatient. The drug will not take full effect until she is in the
  Italian train. Then, she will sleep and sleep. But at Trieste she
  will merely be very dull, very heavy, very docile. And"&mdash;the
  doctor's eyes narrowed&mdash;"she will be far too torpid to worry
  about any phantom lady."</p>

  <p>"Suits me all right...I'll take a chance."</p>

  <p>The doctor accompanied him to the kitchen-car and fought a
  battle with the protesting chef. In the end medical authority won
  the day. Not long afterwards, Hare, with anxious eyes and tightly
  compressed lips, began his fateful journey along the corridors,
  holding a half-filled bowl.</p>

  <p>But he carried so much more than soup. Within the narrow
  circle of the cup lay the destiny of a woman.</p>

  <p>As he staggered on his way&mdash;by a coincidence due to the
  time, in a small stone house in England, Mrs. Froy's thoughts
  turned to nourishment.</p>

  <p>"I do hope Winnie will eat something before she gets to
  Trieste," she said to Mr. Froy. "Her dinner won't stand by her
  all through the night. Besides she is always too excited to eat
  on a journey. She merely pecks her first supper at home."</p>

  <p>Her husband gave a guilty smile, for he knew the reason for
  Winnie's lack of appetite.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Hare was still scared by the responsibility of his
  step. While he assured himself that he was actually carrying a
  gift of sanity to Iris, he could not rid himself of apprehension.
  Tormented by indecision, he proposed a foolish test for
  himself.</p>

  <p>"If I don't spill any it's going to be O.K. But if I do, I'll
  cry off."</p>

  <p>He crabbed slowly along, with utmost care and caution while
  the train seemed to put on an extra spurt of speed. The soup
  splashed furiously against the rim of the cup&mdash;for ever on
  the point of brimming over. Yet, in some extraordinary manner, it
  always whirled within its confines.</p>

  <p>Hare was reminded of a simple circus trick he used to
  practise&mdash;as a boy&mdash;with a hoop and a glass of water.
  Apparently the same principle operated now, and the soup could
  not be spilt from sheer velocity of motion.</p>

  <p>But just before he reached the reserved portion of the train
  he came to grief completely. As he was crossing the connecting
  passage, a small boy&mdash;rushing from the pursuit of a smaller
  girl&mdash;charged into him and received a baptism of soup,
  together with an undesirable name.</p>

  <p>Hare broke off in his malediction to wipe his fingers.</p>

  <p>"That's torn it," he muttered. "Well, it's out of my hands
  now."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Iris was actually in the grip of a brainstorm. When
  the professor left her she was numb with fear. Some vital
  mainspring in her brain seemed to have snapped, reducing her mind
  to a limp tangle. Miss Froy was a lost cause&mdash;so she denied
  her. But nothing was left but a void, without aim or hope or
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>"I was her only chance," she told herself. "And now I've
  crashed too."</p>

  <p>The knowledge was torture which she tried vainly to forget.
  But vivid little thumbnail pictures persisted in flashing before
  her closed eyes. Two bent old people, huddled in a lighted
  doorway&mdash;waiting. Sock&mdash;a woolly
  blunderbuss&mdash;rushing off to meet a mistress who would never
  come home.</p>

  <p>She was most affected by the thought of the dog, for she
  assumed the senility of the aged parents. She told herself that
  the shock would probably kill them both, since they would be too
  devoted&mdash;or too used to each other&mdash;to survive singly.
  And then&mdash;what would become of the dog, stranded and hungry
  in a country cottage?</p>

  <p>She worked herself into a positive fever about him. As her
  temperature rose, her head began to ache so furiously that it
  seemed to bang in a series of small explosions which kept time
  with the frantic revolutions of the wheels.</p>

  <p>"You're get-ting near. You're get-ting near."</p>

  <p>And then the rhythm changed and began to chop out a devil's
  tattoo.
  "Nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;<i>nearer</i>&mdash;
NEARER."</p>

  <p>Nearer to Trieste. The express was in the relentless grip of
  the schedule. The pulsations of the engine throbbed through Iris
  like the shaking arteries of an overdriven heart. It rocked and
  roared over the rails&mdash;a metal monster racing an invisible
  rival.</p>

  <p>It had to beat Time.</p>

  <p>When Hare came into her carriage she hardly raised her eyes,
  and did not speak to him.</p>

  <p>"Still hating me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I only hate myself," she said dully.</p>

  <p>He looked furtively at her twitching face and burning cheeks,
  which, to his mind, confirmed the doctor's diagnosis of
  dangerously overstrung nerves, while he assured himself
  that&mdash;since he could not give her that essential sock on the
  jaw&mdash;he was rendering her a real service.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you some soup," he said guiltily.</p>

  <p>She shrank from it even while she thanked him.</p>

  <p>"Sweet of you&mdash;but I couldn't touch it."</p>

  <p>"Try. It'll make a new man of you."</p>

  <p>"All right, then. Leave it, will you?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's too old a dodge. The instant I go you'll chuck it
  out of the window. Well&mdash;I'm not going."</p>

  <p>Iris clutched her head.</p>

  <p>"I feel so sick," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Lack of nourishment. Listen, my child, there's a history of
  the try-try-again kind connected with that simple bowl of soup. I
  slaughtered the chef to get it in the first place. Then, on my
  way here, some wretched kid bowled the whole lot over...I said,
  'Kismet.' And then I said, 'She's had nothing all day and she'll
  have nothing until tomorrow's breakfast.'</p>

  <p>"And I went all the way back and slaughtered another chef, all
  to bring you a second cup."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;" sighed Iris helplessly. "But have I got to
  be grateful?"</p>

  <p>She swallowed the first spoonful with reluctance, grimacing as
  though it were a nauseous draught; then she paused, while Hare
  waited in acute suspense.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked. "It's got a horribly druggy
  taste."</p>

  <p>"It's the same soup I wolfed down at dinner. That's all I
  know," lied Hare.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd better get it over."</p>

  <p>Raising the cup to her lips, she gulped it down with a
  shudder.</p>

  <p>"You'll feel better soon," Hare assured her as he took the
  empty bowl from her nerveless hands.</p>

  <p>For some time they sat in silence, while he watched her
  stealthily, hoping to detect the first sign of drowsiness. He
  knew that drugs affect people differently, and that it was
  difficult to gauge the right dose for Iris, because of her
  abnormal condition.</p>

  <p>"If anything goes wrong," he thought desperately, "I'll have
  to take the rap."</p>

  <p>At intervals he heard the whine of the professor's voice, as
  he strained it in an effort to be audible above the uproar of the
  train. He was in the next compartment, improving an acquaintance
  with the Misses Flood-Porter, which he hoped to authorise with
  the discovery of a third-party link.</p>

  <p>"You live in Somersetshire," he remarked. "It is a county
  where I have stayed often. I wonder if we know any mutual
  friends."</p>

  <p>"I hate every single person living there," said Miss Rose
  vehemently, sweeping away any claimants to friendship.</p>

  <p>"Stag-hunting," supplemented Miss Flood-Porter.</p>

  <p>Relieved by the explanation the professor began gently and
  skilfully to extricate a few worthy persons from under the
  wholesale ban. He was rewarded when the ladies recognised a
  name.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Charming people. Great friends of ours."</p>

  <p>The contact was complete and they all shouted against each
  other.</p>

  <p>Iris recognised the voices for, after a time, she spoke to
  Hare.</p>

  <p>"That's the professor, isn't it? I wish you'd tell him I want
  to sleep, but can't, because he's making too much noise. And slip
  in something about him being a public nuisance, will you? He'd
  appreciate it. Because that's what he called me."</p>

  <p>The speech was so unexpectedly jaunty, that Hare stared her in
  surprise. He did not know whether he were imagining changes, but
  her eyes were less strained, while her face seemed to have lost
  the glazed flush of fever.</p>

  <p>"That doctor's sold me a pup," he thought wrathfully. "She is
  not settling down. She's gingering up. At this rate she'll be
  fighting-mad at Trieste."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact their little conspiracy was hampered by
  their ignorance of working conditions. On the rare occasions when
  Iris was unwell, her response to treatment was almost immediate.
  In her abnormal state she was now beating her own speed record.
  Although its effects were bound to be short-lived, she was
  feeling miraculously restored by the nourishment, while the drug
  was beginning imperceptibly to soothe her brain-storm, like the
  first film of oil spreading over a rough sea.</p>

  <p>She was conscious of a glow of spurious strength, followed by
  a rush of confidence, as she climbed out of the traitor's hell
  into which she had hurled herself.</p>

  <p>"Lost causes are the only causes worth fighting for," she told
  herself.</p>

  <p>In her relief at her own restoration, she smiled at Hare, who
  grinned back at her.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you you'd feel better after that nice strong
  good nourishing soup?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It tasted as though it was made from a mummy&mdash;but it has
  picked me up," she admitted. "My head's clearer. I realise now
  that the professor was right. I've made an awful fool of
  myself."</p>

  <p>Hare chalked up a good mark to the properties of the drug.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you've chucked Miss Froy off the train?" he
  asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Please, don't bring her up again. Of course, there's no such
  person. I told the professor so."</p>

  <p>Iris felt a momentary pang as she looked into his guileless
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame to trick him," she thought.</p>

  <p>She had resolved on a policy of stratagem. She would sham
  docility, to avert suspicion. When Trieste was reached, she would
  contrive to give them the slip and hire a taxi, in which to
  follow the ambulance. They would not suspect any outside interest
  in their movements, since she was definitely out of the
  running.</p>

  <p>Having warned the taxi-driver in advance to memorise the
  address to which Miss Froy was taken, he would drive furiously
  back to the British Embassy. She had always found Italians
  gallant and susceptible, so she was sure of enlisting their
  sympathies and getting immediate action.</p>

  <p>Her jammed brain was now clicking on with amazing speed. She
  told herself that the success of her plan depended on whether she
  could fool them all. She must return to her own carriage, which
  was full of the doctor's spies, and sham the requisite limp
  submission.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't overdo it," she thought. "They might want to fuss
  over me if they thought I was ill."</p>

  <p>She counted on the confusion when the passengers, with their
  luggage, changed trains at the terminus. Hare must be sent off on
  some errand, since he was her only obstacle. The rest of the
  travellers would remain true to type and look after their own
  interests.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes and met Hare's earnest gaze. He was
  thinking of the nice long sleep which awaited her in the Italian
  train.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame to trick her," he thought.</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32" name="ch32">XXXII. &mdash; THE DREAM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH it was still some distance from
  Trieste, the train was already astir with the projected bustle of
  its arrival. Passengers were beginning to lock opened suitcases
  and to pull on their coats and hats. Infected by the unrest, the
  leisurely professor left the Misses Flood-Porter and entered his
  own coupé.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to disturb you," he hinted to Iris. "But we
  shall soon reach Trieste."</p>

  <p>Iris showed none of her former morbid reluctance to return to
  her own carriage.</p>

  <p>"I must get my suitcase," she said, eager to impress the
  professor with her obedience.</p>

  <p>He rewarded her with an approving smile. For the last time she
  made the shaky journey along the train. Nobody laughed at her or
  took any notice of her, for every one was too pre-occupied with
  affairs. Suitcases and bags had already been lifted down from
  racks and stacked outside the carriages, increasing the
  congestion. Mothers screamed to collect those children who were
  still chasing each other in the corridors.</p>

  <p>They washed their chocolate-grimed mouths with corners of
  moistened handkerchiefs. Banana skins were thrown out of the
  windows&mdash;newspapers bundled under the seats.</p>

  <p>The heat and the jam were so oppressive that Iris was actually
  glad to reach her own compartment. But before she could enter,
  she shrank back as the doctor came out of the invalid's carriage.
  His face looked dry and white as the pith of willow above the
  black blotch of his spade-beard, and his eyes&mdash;magnified by
  his glasses&mdash;were dark turgid pools.</p>

  <p>As he looked at her, she felt that it was useless to try to
  deceive him. Like an expert chess player he would have forseen
  any possible move of her own and would be prepared with a counter
  stroke.</p>

  <p>"Is madame better?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I'm merely slack. Everything seems an effort. And
  once I sit down I shan't want to move again."</p>

  <p>Iris was encouraged by the success of her strategy when the
  two men exchanged a glance of understanding. She went inside her
  compartment, but no one appeared to take any interest in her
  return. The mother and child were reassembling the contents of
  the family suitcases, while the blonde made an elaborate toilet.
  The father had taken charge of the baroness' dressing-bag and was
  evidently prepared to act as temporary courier.</p>

  <p>Iris sat and watched them until the spectacle of noses being
  powdered and waves reset reminded her of her own need to repair.
  It was essential to make a good impression at the Embassy. She
  opened her bag languidly and drew out her flapjack, yawning the
  while with sudden drowsiness. Blinking her eyes violently, she
  began to apply powder and lipstick.</p>

  <p>But before she could finish, her lids were drooping so
  continuously that she could not see properly. To her dismay, she
  realised that she was being overwhelmed with waves of sleep.</p>

  <p>They were too powerful to resist, although she struggled
  vainly to keep awake. One after another they swept over her,
  piling up in a ceaseless procession.</p>

  <p>The other passengers began to waver like shadows. Outside,
  Trieste was visible as a quivering red glow on the night sky. The
  engine thundered and panted in a last stupendous effort to breast
  that invisible tape stretched in front of the buffers. Almost
  abreast, skimmed the vast shadow, with beating wings and swinging
  scythe.</p>

  <p>There was exultation in the stokehold and driver's car, for
  they were actually ahead of the schedule. Time was beaten, so
  they relaxed their efforts and slackened speed gradually in
  readiness for their arrival at Trieste.</p>

  <p>Iris' head had fallen forward and her eyes were closed. Then a
  dog barked in the distance, jerking her awake. As she stared out
  of the window with clouded gaze, a few scattered lights speckling
  the darkness told her that they were reaching the outskirts of
  Trieste.</p>

  <p>In that moment she thought of Miss Froy.</p>

  <p>"Trieste," she agonised. "I must keep awake."</p>

  <p>Then, once again, everything grew blurred and she sank back in
  her corner.</p>

  <p>When Hare returned to the carriage his jaw dropped at the
  sight of her huddled figure. He called to the doctor, who merely
  rubbed his bony hands with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," he said. "She has responded with most
  extraordinary rapidity."</p>

  <p>"But how will I get her out at Trieste?" demanded Hare.</p>

  <p>"You will have no trouble. You can wake her at a touch. This
  is merely preliminary&mdash;what you call a cat's-sleep. She will
  be merely somewhat dazed."</p>

  <p>The doctor turned away, but paused to give a word of
  advice.</p>

  <p>"Better leave her alone until you have secured porters. If you
  wake her too soon she may sleep again. Each time it will be for
  longer."</p>

  <p>Hare took the hint and stood in the corridor, staring out of
  the window. The reflection of the lighted train flowing over the
  masonry of roofs and walls transformed them to the semblance of
  quivering landscape and water. In every carriage luggage was
  being lowered. Voices shouted for service. The fleeting
  friendships of a railway journey were being at once sealed and
  broken in handshakes and farewells.</p>

  <p>Iris slept...</p>

  <p>In the coupé of the bridal pair, the
  barrister&mdash;Todhunter, for a few minutes longer&mdash;was
  doing his utmost to reconcile a gesture of renunciation with a
  strategic retreat.</p>

  <p>"Shall we say 'Good-bye' now?" he suggested. "Before we are
  surrounded with a cloud of witnesses."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Laura ignored his overture.</p>

  <p>"'Good-bye,'" she said, carefully curling her lashes upwards.
  "Thanks for your hospitality. It's been a cheap holiday for me.
  Cheap in every sense."</p>

  <p>In the next coupé the Misses Flood-Porter were facing a major
  tragedy. It was Miss Flood-Porter who threw the bombshell.</p>

  <p>"Rose, did you see the brown suitcase put in the van?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then I believe it's been left behind. It was pushed under the
  bed, if you remember."</p>

  <p>Their faces were rigid with horror, for their purchases had
  been packed together for conscientious declaration.</p>

  <p>"I was counting on Captain Parker to get them through the
  Customs for us," lamented Miss Rose. "But it may be in the
  van."</p>

  <p>"It may. We can do nothing but hope for the best."</p>

  <p>Iris slept on...</p>

  <p>When she was a child she suffered from an unsuspected
  inferiority complex, due to the difference between her lot and
  that of other children. Although pampered by adults she was
  exposed to the secret hostility of some of her companions. She
  was not equal to reprisals, but, at night, her inhibitions found
  expression in dreams of power, when she sacked the toy-stores and
  sweet-shops of London with glorious immunity.</p>

  <p>Time brought its revenge and Iris got on top of her own little
  world. But now the professor's hostility, the antagonism of the
  doctor and baroness, together with the derision of the other
  passengers had combined with her sunstroke to make the old
  inferiority complex flare up again.</p>

  <p>The result was that she passed from unconsciousness into one
  of her childish dreams of power.</p>

  <p>She thought she was still on the express and on her way to
  rescue Miss Froy. The corridors were hundreds of miles long, so
  that it took her centuries to complete what passed within the
  limit of a minute. The doctor and a crowd of passengers kept
  trying to oppose her passages, but she had only to push back
  their faces, when they dissolved like smoke.</p>

  <p>She was mowing them down in swathes when she was aroused by
  the scream of the engine. Shouts and sudden flashes of light told
  her that they were rushing into Trieste.</p>

  <p>Instantly she staggered to her feet&mdash;half-awake and half
  in a dream&mdash;and walked directly into the next
  compartment.</p>

  <p>Her action took every one by surprise. No one expected it as
  it was believed that she was asleep. The doctor and the disguised
  chauffeur were looking out of the window, watching for the
  arrival of the ambulance. But Hare&mdash;who was chatting to the
  guard&mdash;saw her enter, and he made a frantic effort to stop
  her.</p>

  <p>He was too late. Still under the influence of her dream of
  power and secure in her knowledge of immunity which raised her
  high above the fear of consequences&mdash;Iris rushed towards the
  invalid and tore the plaster from her face.</p>

  <p>The doctor had made the final mistake of an unlucky venture
  when he gave her the sleeping-draught. Had she carried out her
  threat to go to the Embassy, she might have encountered
  incredulity and delay. But the drug had given her the courage to
  do the impossible thing.</p>

  <p>As the criss-cross of strips peeled off and dangled in her
  fingers like a star-fish, Hare held his breath with horror. Then
  the guard behind him gave a whistle of astonishment as, instead
  of spurting blood and raw mutilated flesh, the sound though
  reddened skin of a middle-aged woman was revealed. Iris gave a
  low cry of recognition. <i>"Miss Froy</i>."</p> <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33" name="ch33">XXXIII. &mdash; THE HERALD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TWO days later Iris stood on the platform of
  Victoria Station, watching the dispersal of the passengers. Among
  the first to leave were the Misses Flood-Porter. Confident in
  their right to preferential treatment, they stood aloof with
  pleased expressions, while an influential gentleman, with an
  authoritative voice and an infallible method with officials,
  shouted and shepherded their luggage through the Customs.</p>

  <p>Once, by mistake, they looked at Iris, but they were too
  preoccupied to bow. This was England, where she went out of their
  lives.</p>

  <p>They were very gracious, however, to Mrs. Barnes, when she
  came to wish them "Good-bye." Her face was radiant with happiness
  born of a telegram which she had received at Calais.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel's cold quite gone very well again."</p>

  <p>In spite of her impatience to get home to him she lingered to
  listen to the last snatch of gossip from the sisters.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it <i>peculiar</i> about the honeymoon couple?" asked
  the elder Miss Flood-Porter. "I know he wasn't on the Venice
  train, because I looked. And she got off at
  Milan&mdash;alone."</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Mrs. Barnes. "I know my husband wouldn't like me
  to say it&mdash;but it makes you wonder if they were really
  married."</p>

  <p>"Of course they weren't," scoffed Miss Rose. "I'm precious
  glad we had nothing to do with them. If there had been a divorce
  action later on, <i>we</i> might have been subpoenaed as
  witnesses."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed her sister. "It just shows how careful one
  should be when one is abroad. We always keep to our rule
  <i>never</i> to get mixed up in other people's business."</p>

  <p>Iris smiled rather bitterly at the conscious virtue in their
  voices. It reminded her of what she had suffered as a result of
  their policy of superb isolation. With a shrug she turned her
  back on the affectionate leave-taking to watch instead the long
  thin white beams&mdash;as of a myriad searchlights&mdash;thrown
  by the sun through the smoky glass roof.</p>

  <p>Although she was still shaky she felt quick with fresh
  life&mdash;glad to be back&mdash;glad to be alive. While Hare was
  scouting round the piles of luggage, her thoughts slipped back
  journey. Her memories were dim, with many blanks.</p>

  <p>There was a black-out at Trieste, when she crashed completely,
  and she did not realise her surroundings until she was rushing
  through the darkness in the Italian train. Some one with lustrous
  black eyes looked after her, while Hare came and went. She slept
  most of the time, but whenever she woke she was conscious of
  happiness.</p>

  <p>The carriage was crowded with other passengers, all shouting,
  smoking and gesticulating. She could not understand a word, but
  she felt in perfect tune and sympathy with all of them. There was
  so much happiness in the world with the prospect of joyous
  reunions. The barriers of language were down, so that they were
  not alien nationalities but fellow-citizens of the world, united
  by the common touch.</p>

  <p>In the morning she discovered another passenger in the
  carriage&mdash;a little drab, middle-aged woman, with a small
  lined face and vivid blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Iris gave a cry of rapture as she hugged her.</p>

  <p>"Miss Froy. You horrible little brute to give me all that
  trouble...Oh, darling, darling."</p>

  <p>In spite of the joy of reunion Miss Froy proved a bad exchange
  for the Italian stranger. Her fussy attentions, her high tinkling
  laugh, her incessant chatter, became such a strain that Hare had
  to scheme for intervals of release.</p>

  <p>For all the drawbacks, however, there was a sense of great
  adventure and high hope about the journey. The wind seemed to
  blow them along when they travelled across the flat stretches of
  France. Everything moved with them&mdash;streaming smoke and
  fluttering clouds. The wide fields and white sky swam in light,
  so that they felt that they were sailing through a magic
  country.</p>

  <p>Although she was better Hare refused to answer any of Iris'
  questions.</p>

  <p>"Tell you in London," he always said.</p>

  <p>She reminded him of his promise when he returned with her
  suitcase, duly chalked.</p>

  <p>"I can't wait another minute," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Righto," he agreed. "Take a pew."</p>

  <p>Squatting together on a luggage truck and smoking cigarettes,
  she listened to his story.</p>

  <p>"It was all very tame. No rough-house&mdash;no nothing. The
  guard was a hero. He knew just what to do, and the doctor and the
  two nurses went like lambs. You see, they'll probably only be
  charged with attempted abduction."</p>

  <p>"What happened to the baroness?" asked Iris.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she just sailed out, twice her natural size. No
  connection at all with the next carriage...But she'll pull wires
  and wangle their discharge. Wheels within wheels, you know."</p>

  <p>Iris felt indifferent to their fate.</p>

  <p>"What did the others say when they heard about Miss Froy?" she
  inquired eagerly. "After all, I was right&mdash;and every one was
  out of step but me."</p>

  <p>"To be quite candid," said Hare, "it all went in one ear and
  out at the other. We had a close shave at Venice and some of the
  Miss Flood-Porters' luggage was missing. They were in such a
  panic about it that they were prostrate afterwards. And the
  parson's wife was very worried about her husband."</p>

  <p>"But the professor?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's the sort that doesn't like to be proved wrong.
  When he saw Miss Froy running about like a two-year-old, he
  thought it was all exaggerated. I overheard him saying to Miss
  Flood-Porter, 'People generally get what they invite. I cannot
  imagine anything of the kind happening to Miss Rose.'"</p>

  <p>"Neither can I...Every one seems to be saying 'Goodbye.'
  Here's my Miss Froy."</p>

  <p>Hare hurriedly made his escape just in time to avoid the
  little woman. She looked wonderfully fit and seemed actually
  rejuvenated by her terrible experience.</p>

  <p>Although she had grown so irritated by the touch of those
  hard, dry hands, Iris felt a pang of regret now that the parting
  was near.</p>

  <p>"I'm stopping in London for a few hours," confided Miss Froy.
  "Selfridge's, my dear. Just wandering. Topping."</p>

  <p>She looked after Hare as he chased a taxi, and lowered her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I'm just making up my story to tell them at home. Mater will
  be <i>thrilled</i>."</p>

  <p>"But do you think it wise to tell her?" objected Iris. "At her
  age it might prove a shock."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean about me." Miss Froy shook her head and gave
  Iris the conspiratorial wink of one schoolgirl to another. "I'm
  going to keep mum about <i>that</i>. She'd throw a fit and she
  wouldn't let me go back."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" gasped Iris.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I shall have to give evidence at the trial, very
  likely. Besides, all the exciting things seem to happen
  abroad."</p>

  <p>"You're a marvel...But what is the story you're making
  up?"</p>

  <p>Miss Froy grew suddenly young.</p>

  <p>"It's about you&mdash;and your romance. Is it true?"</p>

  <p>Iris did not know herself until that minute.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "I'm going with him on his next trip."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm first to congratulate you. And, one day, perhaps
  you'll congratulate me...And now I must fly to send off my
  wire."</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards, a telegram was received at the little
  grey stone house. Mr. and Mrs. Froy read it together, and later
  each read it, privately, to Sock.</p>

  <p>"Home 8.10 too topping Winnie."</p>

  <p>*</p>

  <p>That evening Mrs. Froy stood at the window of Winnie's
  bedroom. Although she could not see the railway station, she got
  a glimpse of one amber signal lamp through a gap in the
  trees.</p>

  <p>Everything was ready for her daughter's return. The table was
  laid in the dining-room and decorated with vases of white dahlias
  and claret-tinted carrot-tops. The hot-water bottles had been
  removed from the bed. The rarely-used lamp had been lit in the
  hall, and the front door thrown open in readiness, so that a
  strip of light carpeted the mossy garden path.</p>

  <p>The supper was keeping hot in the oven. Mrs. Froy always
  cooked sausages and mashed potatoes for the first meal, under the
  mistaken impression that it was Winnie's favourite dish. It had
  been, some thirty years ago&mdash;but Winnie never had the heart
  to undeceive her.</p>

  <p>Outside the window was darkness and silence. The stars were
  frosty and the keen air held the odour of autumnal bonfires.
  Then, suddenly, the stillness was torn by the scream of the
  distant train.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Froy could trace its approach by the red cloud, quivering
  about the belt of elms which hid the station. She knew when it
  stopped, because the engine panted and blew off some steam.</p>

  <p>It rattled on again, leaving her guessing. She wondered
  whether it had brought Winnie. Perhaps she had lost her
  connection in London. She could see nothing&mdash;hear
  nothing&mdash;for she was growing deaf and her eyes were
  beginning to fail.</p>

  <p>The surrounding darkness baffled her and cheated her with
  unredeemed promises. Figures advanced through the gloom, but just
  as her heart leaped in welcome&mdash;they always changed back to
  trees. She strained vainly to catch the first sound of
  voices&mdash;her husband's deep tones and a girl's high-pitched
  treble.</p>

  <p>As she held her breath in suspense, somewhere in the distance
  a dog barked. Again and again, in frantic excitement Then through
  the open gate and up the lighted path charged the clumsy shape of
  a big shaven dog&mdash;capering like an overgrown
  puppy&mdash;whirling round in circles&mdash;leaping at his
  shadow&mdash;falling over himself in his blundering haste.</p>

  <p>It was the herald who had rushed on ahead, to tell her that
  the young mistress had come home.</p>
