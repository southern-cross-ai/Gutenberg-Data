<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>To so great an extent has the market been flooded with all sorts
and conditions of books relative to the war in South Africa that
the author feels constrained to introduce his with a few words of
apology and explanation, in the hope that he may perhaps justify
himself for seeking to inflict yet another upon a long-suffering
public.</p>

<p>War Correspondents, Doctors, Members of Parliament, Lords and
Lookers-on have, all and sundry, had their say in book form as to
what they have seen and what they have thought about it. Battles,
strategy, transport, hospitals&mdash;all the varied features of
both campaigns have been most thoroughly discussed and debated in
their diversity of light and shade from almost every possible point
of view. So that there would seem at first very little left to
write about. But the Australian soldier, though frequently the
subject of much literary effort, has not yet had his say.
Therefore, in these pages the author has striven to show other
Australians, who had not the good fortune to serve in Africa, what
some phases of campaigning were like, as viewed from the standpoint
of the Australian ranks, and has occasionally ventured to say, as
an Australian, how things have impressed him.</p>

<p>With regard to the two "Battle" chapters, it is perhaps
necessary to explain that, though the incidents and setting are
actual facts, the whole is not intended to represent any particular
engagement, but is rather a kind of composite portrait of half a
dozen or more.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author wishes to acknowledge the kindly
assistance and advice for which he is indebted to Mr. John Arthur
Barry in the making of this book.</p>

<p>SYDNEY, 1902.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>There was a story sent from the Front by the Correspondent of a
Sydney daily newspaper, concerning a Great General, a Field
Hospital and Geography.</p>

<p>New South Wales had a very well-equipped and well-served Army
Medical Corps, which, when troops were offered for service in South
Africa by the Australasian Colonies, had despatched two field
ambulances to the Cape. One of them was at Paardeberg whilst Cronje
sullenly stood at bay in the Modder. The Great General came to see
it. Everything was good, and complete, and well done, and of an
excellence that does not show through a binding of red tape; and
the Great General had never before seen anything quite so good, or
complete, or so well done, and was pleased and interested in all he
saw.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, "and where do you come from?" To which
the P.M.O. made answer: "We are part of the New South Wales Army
Medical Corps".</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," returned the Great General; "yes, New South Wales!
That's Adelaide, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Now the application of this little tale is, that if Great
Generals do not know that New South Wales is not a suburb of
Adelaide, how much less will the average un-Australian reader
comprehend the meaning of the term 'Cornstalk'?</p>

<p>In Gippsland grow the big gum trees. It is a matter of some
pride, perhaps, to Victorians that their province should grow the
largest gum trees in all the Australias. Jealous of Victorian
prowess in eucalyptus cultivation, so to speak, the other
Australians refer to the Victorian people collectively as
'Gum-suckers'!</p>

<p>Because the popular banana finds the climate of Queensland
suitable to its healthy being, the inhabitants of that Colony are
dubbed 'Banana-landers'.</p>

<p>It may have been that, to the early South Australians, means of
subsistence came not easily. At any rate they are called
'Crow-eaters'.</p>

<p>In delicate reference to the nature of their country the West
Australians are 'Sand-gropers'.</p>

<p>Finally, the people of New South Wales, having acquired a
reputation for lankiness and wiriness, have been named
'Cornstalks'.</p>

<p>That a native of the mother colony differs very greatly from the
human product of any other part of Australia is possibly doubtful,
but that, in the days of his youth at any rate, he is usually
slimly built and long of limb is a fact fairly well established.
See him in his own country&mdash;along the creeks and rivers of the
eastern ranges, on the New England and Monaro tablelands, or out in
the sun-baked West&mdash;and you will find that there is something
about him peculiarly characteristic, something of his own that
marks him slightly, but still unmistakably, as himself and no one
else. Place the average bush-bred boy of eighteen beside the same
aged English lad and note the difference.</p>

<p>The Cornstalk is the almost immediate successor of the
Hawkesbury native&mdash;is indeed symbolical of the evolution of
that physically perfect being. Years ago, we of the present
generation are told, if you should see anywhere a particularly
tall, brawny, well-made, big man, you might be morally certain that
he hailed from the farms upon the Hawkesbury River flats. The first
of the free settlers who commenced the march westwards 'squatted'
there, and owned the land by right of occupation. If they could
obtain them, they took wives unto themselves, and reared up
families. And the families subsisted principally upon pumpkin and
ground maize, and wore no boots in their childhood, and led a free,
wild, untrammelled sort of life. So they grew into tall,
clean-limbed, deep-chested men, and sturdy, comely women, and
spread North and West and South over the land&mdash;and their
offspring were the fathers and mothers of the Cornstalks of
to-day.</p>

<p>There were, of course, other places besides the banks of the
Hawkesbury where the pioneers tilled the land and grazed their
flocks, but the Hawkesbury native is typical of the best men and
women of that time.</p>

<p>Big and large, the Cornstalk is a good man. Like most other good
men, he has his faults&mdash;even his vices&mdash;but they are not
yet the faults and vices that bring a people to the gutter. His is
not a new race&mdash;it is rather the renewed, reinvigorated
reproduction of an older one. He has the blemishes of his
forebears, the transmitted characteristics of a not too perfect
ancestry. He has developed little traits, and big traits, of his
own; and many of his leanings look alarming. But, even now, there
is promise and hope&mdash;and, if we may be permitted to say it of
one's own people&mdash;some fulfilment.</p>

<p>He has been spoken of in the Literature of the Hopeless as
'tired'. He has been painted as a somewhat weary decadent&mdash;too
listless, too <i>blasé</i>, too worn-down by the overwhelming burden of
existence to act the part of a strong man, of a vigorous and
energetic citizen. The weird melancholy of the Bush has warped his
soul. Too much meat, too much tobacco, too little grinding poverty,
have combined to unnerve and render him effete. If we are to
believe it all, he is tending towards a sort of demoralising
apathy, a listless carelessness that will make him, in time,
something akin to the more degenerate Latin type&mdash;a creature
too feeble, too vacillating and uncertain, to help himself and keep
his place near the surface in the struggle for existence. But,
perhaps, recent events have proved that this is a false view. We
may thank Heaven that he is better than he has been represented to
be in this class of literature.</p>

<p>He is, at times, 'flash'. He considers himself to be rather a
better man than most other men. He is said to lack reverential
feeling, to respect little that is worthy of respect. Undoubtedly
he loves holiday, he thinks more of sport than of work. He is well
able to sound his own trumpet, and he thoroughly believes in the
correctness of its notes. But these are not hopeless
characteristics. Flashness is only another name for
self-confidence&mdash;merely the over development of the bump of
self-respect. It is good and healthy to appreciate oneself. He does
not really want in reverence&mdash;he is shy. Why should he not
love sport and holiday? Few of us work for fun, and if you don't
sound your own trumpet, who is likely to sound it for you? Taking
him 'in the lump,' the Cornstalk is not a bad fellow. Above all
things, he is no Degenerate.</p>

<p>Curiously noticeable in South Africa were the variations in
'English as she is spoke' amongst the troops of the Empire. From
the broad dialects of the men from the different counties of
England&mdash;of the Scotch and of the Irish&mdash;the speech and
accent of the various Colonial contingents were strangely distinct.
To the newcomer from Canada or Australia, a Yorkshire 'Tommy' was,
at first, almost as unintelligible as a Chinaman. Doubtless the
reverse was true also. There were few distinctions in dress as the
campaign grew older, and most men looked alike, but one was
generally able to locate a man's habitat in the Empire as soon as
he opened his lips to speak. From the rounded, full-voiced English,
the broad Scotch, or the Irish brogue, the Canadian twang and the
Australian drawl were as distinguishable as the French language is
from the German. Roughly, the difference is this&mdash;the
Englishman says all his word; the Canadian emphasises the last
syllable sharply, and the Australian slurs the terminations. In
Australia, where all people speak more or less alike, this
peculiarity of ours escapes one; but in Africa, where it could be
compared, and always was in contrast, with so many accents and
modes of expression, it was extraordinarily apparent. And of
nothing was this difference in speech more suggestive than of the
wideness of the Empire.</p>

<p>So Tommy Cornstalk is generally a long-limbed fellow, with a
drawling twang, to whom anything in the nature of sport appeals
most strongly. He is a newer being than the English 'Tommy,' and he
is pretty much, though not quite, of the same species as the
Canadian.</p>

<p>But we want to consider him as a soldier, and to discover what
his capacities and capabilities are for soldiering.</p>

<p>Above, of course, one has not considered the Cornstalk of the
city. His is another story. The Cockney is not taken as the
standard Englishman. John Bull is typically a farmer; and his son
Jack Bull, of Australia, is a bushman.</p>

<p>Most of the rank and file of the troops who went to South Africa
from Australia were of the Bush.</p>

<p>From the history of the Dutch people in South Africa&mdash;their
hardships and struggles as pioneers in the first place, and their
open-air, half-civilised existence nowadays&mdash;it was, from the
outbreak of hostilities, a matter of universal opinion throughout
the Colonies that the Boer should be met by men who resembled him
in their ways of living, in their training as horsemen, and, more
particularly, in their education as expert rifle shots.</p>

<p>When troops were offered by the several Australian Governments
last year (and accepted perhaps in the first place as a
compliment), the movement was regarded in Australia not as a mere
formal evidencing of the loyalty and good will of the Colonies to
the Motherland, but rather as a serious step taken to assist her
with men trained to the same conditions, if not of war, then of
ordinary life as obtain amongst the Veldt-dwelling Boers of South
Africa. And, afterwards, the Imperial Government seemed to view the
matter in the same light; though at first, before the irregular
troops had proved that they were of some worth, at least, there
seemed to be in England the feeling of
'we-don't-want-them-but-they'll-feel-hurt-if-we-refuse'.</p>

<p>The Bushman&mdash;the dweller in the country as opposed to the
town-abiding folk&mdash;the real Cornstalk, is, to all practical
purposes, of the same kind as the Boer. It is not to be supposed
for a moment that he generally possesses the meaner attributes of
the Boer character. He is not constitutionally a liar (except in
the matters of horses and dogs). However one may wish to do the
Africander justice, it is difficult to believe that he possesses
the same views with regard to honour and fair dealing as obtain
amongst Englishmen. To be 'slim,' to 'verneuk' his neighbour, is,
with the Boer, a by no means bad failing. We are certainly no
better in most things than we ought to be, but, if only as policy,
we <i>do</i> deal more with truthfulness than do the Boers.</p>

<p>One does not wish to decry or make little of a people whom one
has learned to respect as a brave and hardy race, and a gallant
foe, and it is perhaps the most charitable view to take if we
assume that the Boer's ready resort to lying of a bad kind is a
flaw in his nature for which he is scarcely accountable&mdash;and
try and understand that he is sometimes unable to grasp the
wrongness of falsity and crooked dealing. It is not intended,
therefore, to imply that the Cornstalk, when likened to the Boer,
is necessarily possessed of the more objectionable attributes of
the latter. Neither, moreover, is he such a slothful and
retrogressive person in his conduct of life. What we wish to point
out is, that in training, in conditions of living, in environment,
and to some extent in ancestry, the Cornstalk and the Boer have
very much that is in common.</p>

<p>As a soldier, Tommy Cornstalk differs considerably from his
cousin Tommy Atkins. His soldiering is mainly of the present.
Active service is the first occasion upon which he has been called
to obey unquestioningly in all things since he has worn a uniform.
The only discipline he really knows is the 'discipline of
enthusiasm'. He may have made many sacrifices for his volunteering.
He may have been accustomed to ride miles to his parades. His
shooting may have cost him time and money. He may have taken pains
innumerable to perfect himself, as far as was in his power, and
with the means at his command, in all his duties&mdash;but, until
he has signed his attestation paper, almost until he has embarked
upon the troopship, he has never thoroughly been 'under the whip'!
He has never known what it means to be the unthinking piece of
mechanism, the pawn in the game, which all soldiers necessarily
become under a strict and unswerving discipline.</p>

<p>And, at first, he does not take altogether kindly to it. He has
been a free man&mdash;within certain limits a law unto
himself&mdash;accustomed in his democratic country to acknowledge
no man as being, <i>per se</i>, his superior, unless a well-tested one. He
may have been to school with some of his officers, may know them
intimately in civil life. It is even possible that, in his own
district, he may occupy a social position above that of his
officer. And this is where, to the average Cornstalk soldier, the
shoe pinches. It seems to him bitterly hard that he is required to
salute a man whom he may not consider at all his better. It is
irk-some and uncongenial to him to have to address him as 'Sir,' or
as 'Mister So-and-so'. It is absurd to be expected to stand 'as
stiff as a gate post' with his toes nicely turned out to an angle
of forty-five degrees. It annoys him to have to trouble himself
about the paying of compliments and such like, to his thinking,
vexatious and foolish matters. And so, when he meets the Imperial
Officer he astonishes him; and when he meets Tommy Atkins he wins
that gentleman's admiration and awestruck regard by his cool and
happy neglect of the things which have been drilled into Tommy as
sacredly to be observed under all circumstances.</p>

<p>"What is the use of it all?" he argues; "how does it help to
lick the Boers, and get to Pretoria?"</p>

<p>As the Boer despises a 'voet-looper' so is Tommy Cornstalk
ashamed to be seen walking. He is essentially a horseman&mdash;and
generally a horsey man. His sphere as a soldier lies in mounted
work&mdash;rather, perhaps, in the work of mounted infantry than in
that of cavalry. To be a 'toey' seems to him almost to amount to
degradation. He thanks God that he is not an infantryman&mdash;and
this not because he does not give credit for and respect the
magnificent work of the infantry, but because it is his nature to
look down upon the man who walks. In Australia the possession of a
horse carries with it something of a guarantee of respectability
and solvency. A man who cannot read is far less to be pitied than
one who cannot ride.</p>

<p>Generally, he is a good shot. Indeed, it is doubtful whether
there is any better shot in the world than the
kangaroo-shooter&mdash;although, of course, all Cornstalks are not
kangaroo-shooters. He is quite as good, if not a slightly better
shot than the Boer. But he must fire as he pleases. Volleys, save
when delivered at long and uncertain ranges to keep down the fire
of the enemy, find small favour with him. It is not enough for him
to 'loose off' his rifle, in the vague hope of his bullet chancing
to drop where some one is; he must have a definite target to 'loose
off' at.</p>

<p>Whatever Tommy Cornstalk may be as a fighter, he owes little of
his capacity for war to drill or instruction. He has known no
riding-school, he has not studied the care of the horse in a little
red book. It is only by painful effort that he learns to roll his
coat correctly over his wallet&mdash;in order that he may give his
mount a sore wither. He would prefer to carry it in a fashion less
uncomfortable for his horse. He is feeble in the salute. He hardly
ever knows when to turn out the guard. His concerted movements lack
precision. He resents exclusiveness&mdash;even in a General
Officer.</p>

<p>But nevertheless he is a highly trained man of war. He has
learned to ride through pine scrubs, down mountain sides, over
rotten ground, about cattle camps. It has been his business to be a
horseman. He has been more or less of a horseman from his babyhood.
He has studied marching on the travelling stock routes; to endure
thirst on the dry stages; to sleep in the mud or the saddle. Mother
Earth is a familiar bed. His knowledge of scouting has been
acquired young. You cannot teach a man to scout in a suburb or from
a text-book. To look for sheep across a plain that quivers with
mirage, or upon the steep 'sidings' in the hills, to seek wild
cattle in the scrubs, trains one's eyes. Tracks acquire a language
when a knowledge of their 'true inwardness' may mean your daily
bread.</p>

<p>He has been taught to forage on the road. The feeding of one
horse in war time is a simple matter compared to stealing grass for
a mob of sheep or cattle. He has had to cook for himself, to sew
for himself, to depend upon himself in his often lonely,
self-reliant existence. In his own business, his daily life, he has
unconsciously been taught what is as important a thing to know on
active service as anything (and which all the barrack training of
the regular will not have taught him), and that is how to be
comfortable, how to become a good 'doer' under all adverse
circumstances.</p>

<p>'Looting' comes to him naturally, though apparently not quite so
naturally as to the Canadian, who is the most accomplished 'looter'
in all the world.</p>

<p>This is a compliment which is none the less deserved because all
looting was sternly forbidden by the British authorities; and as it
happened, therefore, neither Cornstalk nor Canadian had much scope
for the exercise of this particular talent.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that it is treeless, the veldt is not unlike
our plain country. It is better watered, and often better
grassed.</p>

<p>But, altogether, the Cornstalk was at home in it. There were the
same long distances between towns. The 'dorp' represented the Bush
township. There were the familiar wire fences. The sky above was as
darkly blue. There was, as a rule, plenty of sunshine, and the wide
rolling downs quivered and danced with the same beautiful
mirage-making islands of kopjes, and long, low spits of ridges. He
had to fight in a country not altogether so new to him as it must
have been to Englishmen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II - THE VELDT</h2>

<p>Writing in the <i>Friend</i> at Bloemfontein, during the short but
brilliant existence of that journal as a 'commandeered' newspaper,
under the editorial direction of several of the war correspondents,
a contributor described the veldt as 'inexpressible'. And, if you
come to think of it, that is just about what it is.</p>

<p><i>Lonely</i>, mournful, wild, mysterious&mdash;all the adjectives you
may care to lavish upon it, and something besides that you are not
able to say. There is some key-note to it all which is hard to
find&mdash;something subtle, vague, half-hidden. Lonely it is;
terribly lonely in its great distances, its broad stretches of
level plain, or rolling downs, without habitation. Mysterious, in
its mile upon mile of changeless characteristic, its very
duplication of itself. Mournful, in its apparent emptiness of most
that makes a country prosperous. Wild, in its half-savage black
population, and its almost as half-savage white one. It is
beautiful or hideous, sad or bright in the sunshine, as the mood
takes you, but always, even unto the worst of its recollection, it
is fascinating, and fascinating because it is inexpressible.</p>

<p>You may have starved on it, shivered in wet blankets as you lay
in its clinging mud, bled on it, buried your comrade in
it&mdash;but afterwards, when you look back to it, and time shall
have wrapped a haze of interest round its sterner outlines, you
will remember the charm, the half-unconscious attractiveness, the
indefinable something that was of its very nature. At any rate, you
will never forget it.</p>

<p>Sunrise&mdash;with dew sparkling like diamond points on the long
waving grass, the fresh breeze fanning your face, the glorious blue
sky overhead boasting of the coming day, the flat-topped purple
kopjes far away on the yellow horizon; a white farmhouse, with its
deep green setting of eucalyptus and willow, in the middle
distance; and the splendid, dry, invigorating atmosphere about
you&mdash;was always beautiful. In the noontide, the clear sunlight
made lakes and lagoons before you, clearer and more distinct even
than the mirage of our Western plains. In the evening, the sunset
threw long shadows of men and horses across the long levels. And at
night, when you lay out on its wide bosom, tucked away snugly into
your brown blanket&mdash;the bright stars glittering like electric
points up in their indigo setting, while the smoke from your pipe
curled lazily into the darkness, and you thanked God for a few
hours of rest and peace&mdash;then it was that the veldt had its
greatest charm.</p>

<p>It might easily have been that one had to muster Sandy Flat or
the Black Mountain in the morning. There might have been branding
to start on in the daylight, or forty miles to ride through the
pine scrub and belar before you should camp again. In the drowsy
interval between the last few whiffs of Boer tobacco and sleep, it
was not very difficult to imagine oneself spending a night out on
the Run, with prospect of a hard day's work to be done on the
morrow.</p>

<p>But it was only then, in the dreamy state before oblivion, that
you could think such things. All round were the far-stretching
lines of picketed horses, looming black and indistinct in the faint
light from sparse and tiny fires; the crouching figures of
overcoated men cooking their scanty rations for next day's march,
and huddled heaps of sleepers between the horse lines.</p>

<p>And if, later, you should awake when the precious fires had
dwindled down to points of light, and only the sentries on the
lines sat shivering in the early morning chill, you would find
something wanting in the veldt-night, something whose absence would
strike you as strangely unfamiliar in your experience of sleeping
out o' doors. Everything seemed to have become quiet. There were no
crickets, no frogs, no ''possums' scratching in the trees, no
curlews with their wailing notes, no plover&mdash;nothing but dead
absolute silence&mdash;save the muffled munching of an occasional
hungry horse nibbling at the grass beside his picket-leg.</p>

<p>Now, in the Bush there is never silence, comparatively;
everything is quiet and at rest, but all night long you hear the
subdued hum of wakeful life of some kind&mdash;the ceaseless
chirping of crickets, the hoot of a mophawk or a night owl, the
wild discordant screech of plover, a frog croaking unweariedly in
the creek below you, a 'willy-wagtail' trilling his sweet notes in
the tree overhead&mdash;always some performer in Nature's orchestra
playing his little part in the ceaseless symphony of night.</p>

<p>But here, in this naked Africa, everything is stiller than the
grave at night. Once, may-be, you might have lain awake and heard
the beasts come down to water, and the lions roaring, but now the
lions are in the North&mdash;none nearer than the
Zoutpansberg&mdash;and the buck are scared away too far by the
presence of all these men and horses to disturb your rest by
nocturnal wanderings. And it is this uncanny stillness that reminds
you of the fact that you are not at home in the good Bush. There
will be no branding to-morrow. It will be harder work than
branding, more exciting rides than chasing cattle through the
scrubs or down the mountain tracks. And you are never quite certain
whether there will be another nightfall for you. But that doesn't
trouble you much. If you can get some biscuits and some bully-beef,
and a fairly even place to spread your blanket in, the
consideration of eternity may easily postpone itself for the time
being.</p>

<p>One day, it came to pass that a 'Rimington Tiger' and the writer
foregathered at the back of a battle&mdash;the one having been sent
upon a message and being unable to find his regiment again, and the
other with a dead-lame horse whose leg sinews had been wrenched by
a fall into an ant-bear hole. Both were tired, and hungry, and
thirsty, and uncertain whither to turn, or what to do in order to
reach their own units&mdash;so they decided to lunch. The 'Tiger,'
who was of a meek aspect redeemed by strong blue eyes, was the
fortunate possessor of a canvas water-bag about three parts full,
and a pocketful of broken biscuit; and the writer had a little tea
and a very much smaller quantity of sugar. So, some way behind a
low ridge, along the crest of which recumbent 'khakis' sputtered
ceaselessly with their Lee-Metfords, an economical fire was lit,
and fed by little sticks and roots from the scanty bushes which
supplied the only wood available, and afterwards, when the flame
was strong enough to 'go alone,' with pieces of dry cow-dung.
Little white clouds occasionally formed in the air above the ridge,
and then groups and driblets of men came away from the firing-line
to a field dressing-station over to our right. We were too absorbed
in the contemplation of our almost boiling mess-tin to take much
notice.</p>

<p>Suddenly a Boer shell came howling beyond the ridge, and banged
up a heap of dust and gravel just short of where our cooking
operations were being conducted. Things screamed in the air
shrilly, so we concluded that our meal would be more inviting if
partaken of in some place where such ill-timed and intrusive
interruptions were less likely to inflict themselves upon us.
Therefore we moved the can and a fire-stick laboriously to another
position, and finished the brew under difficulties. The Boer
gunners, for some reason best known to themselves, continued to
shell the spot where we had been, probably with an idea that
stronger re-inforcements were sheltering behind the ridge. After a
meal, less abundant than welcome, the Rimington delivered himself
of sundry emphatic opinions concerning his native land.</p>

<p>"The country's no dam good," he said. "I know it from King
William's Town to Bulawayo, and it's not fit for a white man to
live in. Y'd like to try ten thousand acres? Well, y're better out
of it, by a long chalk. Locusts, rinderpest, scab, fluke, foot-rot!
Droughts, floods, fires, fever, that's what it is! Crops! What's
the use of crops when there's locusts to eat 'em? Good as
Australia? Well, Australia ain't much, then. You take it from
me&mdash;keep clear of Africa, leave farming to the Kaffirs.
Mining's the on'y thing, an' y'haven't a dog's show without
capital. Rhodesia's the worst of the lot. The country's no dam
good."</p>

<p>But, in spite of this particular Rimington Guide, himself a
native of Cape Colony and obviously a pessimist; in spite of scores
of other men who should know, and who have spoken of it in a
similar strain; in spite of one's own prejudice against a place
where one has enjoyed hardship and danger and discomfort, the
writer is still of opinion, however little such opinion may be
worth, that the country is good&mdash;better far even than the
general run of Africanders give it credit for being.</p>

<p>Up to Modder River&mdash;when en route to Bloemfontein <i>viâ</i>
Paardeberg, Osfontein and Driefontein&mdash;the country is
disappointing. One cannot speak with any knowledge of the karoo
after viewing it from the window of a moving train, however
leisurely that train may proceed. (And South African trains do not
hurry&mdash;especially troop trains.) It looks poor, barren,
destitute of herbage, or indeed of anything edible, but there were
glimpses of flocks of shorn sheep which were in far from poor
condition. Some were almost fat. Their only visible means of
support was apparently a small, scrubby bush, growing hardly more
than a foot or two in height, and not unlike the species of
salt-bush known in Australia as 'cotton-bush'.</p>

<p>But generally, thereabouts, the country is wretchedly
inhospitable in appearance. Gradual rocky slopes, broken here and
there by kopjes and low ranges of stony hills, stretch up beyond De
Aar and past the Orange River, until you reach the Modder. Here,
there is at least promise of something better. The plains are
level, and the soil more promising, and if the surface had not been
churned up into endless dust by an army it might have been
grassed.</p>

<p>Before the war, Modder River was a favourite 'watering place,'
whither pic-nic parties and Sunday schools came from Kimberley. In
springtime the banks were knee-deep in grass, they said, and aglow
with beautiful wild-flowers. Now they were cut up by the numberless
tracks of waggons and guns, littered with the impedimenta of a
great host, scarred with the marks of recent battle. The pretty
cottages of the village were torn and pock-marked by shell and
bullet, and the drift itself&mdash;the beautiful, lazy, tree-shaded
drift&mdash;a discoloured bog.</p>

<p>Out from the Modder station, on the road to Jacobsdaal, the long
plains seemed more like the veldt one had read of than anything
seen hitherto. Beyond Osfontein farm&mdash;in the early year, just
after the rains&mdash;it struck one as being almost the best
country one had ever seen.</p>

<p>Miles, and miles, and miles of rolling downs stretched away
right up to Bloemfontein. Long, waving, succulent grasses, as good
as the best our plains produce. You rode through it with the
sensation of riding through a field of ripening wheat. It seemed a
pity, almost, that all these thousands of horses should trail
through it, trampling it down, and wasting it needlessly. So thick
and luxuriant was it that it caught in your stirrup-irons, your
scabbard 'swished' through it. When you lay down to sleep at night
you were in a little grass-walled enclosure. It seemed like an
ideal 'fattening' country. And it never looked better than in the
early morning, when the sun had painted it gold-green, and the long
shadows of the kopjes lay across it like dark carpets. Sometimes we
saw the fattest of fat cattle&mdash;but terribly mongrel
cattle.</p>

<p>And yet people tell you that it is hard to live here, that
farming or grazing do not pay. There is the scab, and the
rinderpest, and the fluke; and when you're done with all of them,
the locust and the drought.</p>

<p>Heavens! they don't know what drought is. Undoubtedly scab, and
rinderpest, and fluke, and locusts are formidable things&mdash;when
you sit down and look at them. What an utterly hopeless, deadly
state a man's soul must be in when he can calmly contemplate a
visitation of scab, rinderpest, fluke or locusts as the justly
incurred manifestation of God's wrath, with whose course it would
be impious to meddle, and the only remedy for which is a casting
back for sins committed that may have merited punishment, and a
resolve to avoid such errors in the future!</p>

<p>According to the Boer mind, you don't get scab in your flock
because you have omitted necessary precautions in your methods of
sheep-farming, but because you have perhaps stolen a pair of boots
when you visited the dorp at Nachtmaal, or because you didn't
attend Nachtmaal, or 'took down' your neighbour over a horse-deal
when you did. And it is easy to understand how difficult it would
be to bring about any concerted action towards counteracting the
effect of such visitations as the aforesaid, or stamping out
disease altogether amongst such people.</p>

<p>One can only, of course, speak as a tourist speaks of a country
he has run through. One's practical knowledge of the veldt and its
products is probably limited to some observance of the value or
uselessness of its ant-heaps as 'cover' and such purely warlike
uses. But, in the light of common reason, in comparison with what
our own pastoralists and farmers have to contend with in Australia,
in view of its fertility and natural advantages and rainfall, one
cannot altogether accept the veldt as bad country, or as country in
which it should be difficult to make both ends meet&mdash;not to
speak of their overlapping. It is well watered naturally and it has
splendid facilities for catching rain in tanks and dams. It is
fertile&mdash;Kaffirs grow great crops of mealies almost by
scratching up the soil with a stick. Had it not been for the
excellent grazing that it was nearly always possible to obtain for
the cavalry horses in the Free State and the Transvaal it is
perhaps no exaggeration to say that the rapid movements of the
Cavalry Division would have been impossible.</p>

<p>But more weighty than all in arguing favourably to the veldt is
the fact that it has supported so large a savage population as it
has done in the past, and does still to a lesser extent. After all,
the great test of a country's fertility and value&mdash;perhaps the
only sure test&mdash;lies in the number of human beings and wild
animals it will provide a living for.</p>

<p>Perhaps the truest light in which one may regard the veldt is in
that of a field that has lain fallow, has never been thoroughly
tried, has never yet been given a wholesale chance of showing what
it can do.</p>

<p>Considered as a campaigning ground 'much may be said on both
sides'. For the defence, the veldt is fortified, and well
fortified, by its kopjes. Every kopje is a natural stronghold. But
it is too open to really make a stand in, unless it be on the banks
of rivers where scrub and brushwood afford 'cover,' and steep banks
shelter from shell-fire. For the attack it ought to be free from
possibilities of ambuscade. Unfortunately, it does not seem to have
been always so&mdash;but that is another story&mdash;it should have
been. There can be few countries in the world where scouting should
be less difficult. Open country, a clear atmosphere, little timber,
an almost unavoidable skyline, are natural features that do not
readily lend themselves to the concealment of large bodies of men
or horses. Consider the difficulties that would present themselves
in our veldt country here&mdash;the plains. Belts of
timber&mdash;some kind of cover nearly everywhere&mdash;would
render the reconnaissance of positions a task of infinitely greater
trouble than was the case in the open veldt of South Africa.</p>

<p>Compared, indeed, to almost any part of Australia, the veldt
possesses features that render it much less dangerous for the
attacker than would be the case here. It is, too, a country where
roads may be almost disregarded, and where, consequently, the
troubles of transport are very much less than in timbered, hilly,
or 'sticky' localities. And, in view of its facilities for grazing,
as mentioned above, it was most excellent country from the point of
view of the horse, the mule and the ox.</p>

<p>From the domestic standpoint, the veldt was bad&mdash;very bad.
Its timberless nature was the cause of the greatest hardship that
the army had to endure&mdash;want of firewood. Sleeping in the open
air, even if the weather be wet, is not such a very uncomfortable
business, provided that you can obtain a good fire. But when you
have no means of cooking the raw beef and flour you sometimes get
by way of rations; when you are soaked to the skin, and cannot keep
warm; when you have no chance of drying one-half of your body at a
time in the glow of a cheerful blaze&mdash; then, indeed, is war
hard, and stern, and comfortless. Many times did Tommy Cornstalk
sigh wearily for just one good ring-barked paddock, for just one
big log of the many that were lying all over Australia
unappropriated to light his fire under.</p>

<p>On first acquaintance the veldt appears to be an ideal ground
for the manoeuvring of mounted troops. Its looks belie it, however,
to a certain extent. It is undermined everywhere by holes and
burrows of a peculiarly treacherous kind. They were said to be the
work of the 'meer-cat' or the 'ant-bear'. Whatever made them, they
were always pitfalls for the unwary&mdash;and for the wary too.
Unless you watched where you were going at the 'trot' or 'gallop,'
you almost always came to grief, and, if you were not damaged
yourself, the subsequent state of your horse's leg-sinews generally
necessitated your walking for a day or two, or even 'commandeering'
from friend or foe, a remount of sorts, according to your skill as
a horse-thief, or your luck.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III - THE MARCH</h2>

<p>If you have the last couple of hours' 'watch' on the
horse-lines, you see it all. The long rows of picketed scarecrows,
shivering with drooping heads, each in the little bare circle where
he has nibbled the grass to its very roots during the night; the
straight rows of saddles in front of the horses; the huddled heaps
of brown blankets covering curled-up figures of men in the wet
grass; away back in the rear the dingy waggons with the tarpaulins
over them, and the cooks' fires in between. It is the half light
that makes everything look dull and comfortless just before the
fresh new day comes with the promise that seems to wait on every
dawn, no matter what the real prospect may be, and, walking up and
down to keep warm, you look out on the sleeping camp with a feeling
of loneliness and chill.</p>

<p>Already the cooks are astir. You called them half an hour
ago&mdash;according to your instructions, so that they might make
the coffee for breakfast&mdash;and they are breaking up
biscuit-boxes for fuel, and kindling their fires round the piled up
'dixies' (a 'dixie' is a big cooking pot used for making soup, or
tea, or coffee&mdash;but why 'dixie' deponent knoweth not). They
have been filled overnight, and closely guarded by the cooks, who
have slept amongst them, lest unprincipled sinners fill their
water-bottles with the precious water they contain, in preparation
for the next day's march.</p>

<p>A few Kaffir transport drivers&mdash;weird figures crouching in
coloured blankets&mdash;are boiling their 'mealie-pap' in
three-legged pots at little fires of their own.</p>

<p>Across the grey veldt in front, a small cluster of saddled
horses, grouped close together, is silhouetted against a sky fast
growing pale and luminous. Left and right of it are similar groups,
with intervals of a mile, or more, between. They are the outposts.
Farther away still, as the light grows stronger you see occasional
black specks of sentries sitting on ant-heaps, or moving slowly
backward and forward&mdash;cold, hungry, miserable&mdash;who, the
outermost line between Empire and Republics, have spent the night
on the alert, so that the Division might sleep. Away on the right
of your own brigade is another swarm of horses and waggons and
guns, apparently grouped together haphazard and without any
definite order. It is the other Brigade, all duly ordered in its
regiments and squadrons and troops, but, in the distance, looking
like a mob who have wandered together in the night and off-saddled
promiscuously.</p>

<p>The world seems very still, and lifeless, and cold. As the day
becomes more and more daylike, the long dry grass shines white with
frost, and the huddled heaps of blankets are grey and stiff with
it. It is on your overcoat, and little showers of it fall upon your
boots drily, as you move through the grass.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hoarse voice raps out an order&mdash;there is no
trumpeting at reveille on the march. The voice seems to have no
effect. Again, and angrily, it rings out. It is a great and
important voice&mdash;that of the regimental Sergeant-Major. Single
figures flit about the lines, from heap to heap. More voices join
in.</p>

<p>The heaps on the ground stir, and roll, and are convulsed by
spasmodic internal movements. Strange figures in woollen nightcaps
emerge from them slowly, and, one by one casting off their
coverings, sit up, blinking and sleepy-eyed. They rise to their
feet, fully dressed, and stretch themselves. A hasty shake and the
buckling on of spurs is the only toilet. A sergeant comes striding
down his troop, inquiring sarcastically whether the remaining heaps
of blankets would like cups of tea brought to them. Corporals move
about kicking up the sluggards. Slowly and stiffly man after man
staggers, half-awake, to his horse, and commences to rub him down
with more or less energy. Blankets are folded, white and wet still,
and put on the horses' backs to serve as saddle-cloths. Then the
bare saddles are girthed on, carbines stuck into 'buckets,' and
swords slipped into their 'frogs'. Where the heaps lay are only
left the scanty domestic utensils&mdash;men's tins and meat
cans&mdash;haversacks and bandoilers. The gun teams are being
harnessed over in the Artillery lines. Nose-bags hang to the
horses' heads&mdash;a quarter filled by two handfuls of oats.</p>

<p>Some one from the fires shouts "Coffee up!" and away go the
corporals from each troop to carry over the steaming 'dixies'.
There is a 'tinny' clatter, as the dregs and leaves of last night's
tea are knocked out of the mess-tin lids against boots and
picket-pegs, and little knots of cloaked figures swarm round the
'dixie' allotted to each troop, every one anxious lest he should
miss his rightful proportion, which is barely half a pint. The
great thing is to be in time when anything in the shape of rations
is being doled out. In the English regiments each man puts his
mess-tin on the ground. When all who have to share are present, the
corporal fills each receptacle up evenly, and, if anything remains
over distributes it in another round, no one venturing to touch his
tin until all are served and the 'dixie' empty. This ensures 'a
fair show' and no favour. But amongst the less well-regulated
Australians it was usually a rush and a pushing in. It was
impossible, always, for the distributor to remember each man whom
he had served, and not a difficult thing for any one to 'come the
double attack,' but such meanness was rare, public opinion being
too strong upon the point. One never knew when the exigencies of
service might not render it impossible to be in the first rush, and
it was accordingly self-protection, and not an altruistic feeling,
that caused 'coming the double' to be sternly discountenanced by
all and sundry.</p>

<p>You drink your apology for coffee while it is hot. Heat is its
only virtue. Tasteless, almost sugarless, weak&mdash;it can rarely
be regarded as a stimulant, never as likely to affect one's
nerves&mdash;and consequently one's shooting. But 'something hot'
before you start your march is as salvation, even though it be only
hot water. Occasionally it is the only breakfast you have. If you
are well looked after by your Quarter-master, however, there is
generally a biscuit and some 'bully-beef'. Whatever it may be that
you have, you eat it as you move about, between the packing of your
wallets and the rolling of your overcoat. It does not do to be in
un-ready when the 'prepare to mount' comes. The army biscuit is a
thing not to be negotiated hastily, or approached flippantly. Eaten
in its primitive hardness, without any soaking overnight in water,
at least half an hour is occupied in the mastication of one
biscuit. It is hard, tasteless, and nutritious&mdash;so nutritious
that a man may at least keep body and soul together on one per
diem, provided there be a bit of pumpkin, or a cob of mealies, to
eke it out.</p>

<p>By the time you have broken your fast, you have put on and
attached to your horse all the immense burden which that
unfortunate quadruped is required to carry on active service. The
wallets attached to either side of the pommel of the saddle are
stuffed tight with your towel, minor effects, spare shirt (if you
have one) and one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition. Over them
is strapped the rolled overcoat&mdash;wallets and coat together
making up a weight well calculated to give the horse a sore wither.
Underneath the saddle, as mentioned above, is the rider's sleeping
blanket. Strapped to the cantle is the 'rear-pack,' which may
consist of anything from a rolled and empty waterproof sheet to a
bundle of firewood. Attached to the rear-pack is usually an
oat-sack containing from ten to fifteen, or even twenty pounds of
grain&mdash;on the 'off' side hangs a heavy carbine in its leathern
'bucket'; on the 'near,' a sword, useless except for
potato-digging, and unnecessarily heavy by reason of its steel
scabbard. From this side of the saddle also depends the feed-bag
with the day's ration for the horse in it.</p>

<p>Wallets and overcoat on the wither, yourself in the middle of
the horse's back, rear-pack, oat-sack, sword, carbine, feed-bag
behind&mdash;little wonder is it that we fight indecisive
rear-guard actions, that the sword is never used save as a
tent-pole or a spade, that Steyn and Kruger are able to escape from
Poplar Grove, although thousands of mounted men threaten their line
of retreat to Bloemfontein. But the Red Book&mdash;the same Red
Book whose teachings are of volleys fired standing up&mdash;has
laid down the law, and so it is the law.</p>

<p>One cannot but pause here to consider this matter of the
cavalryman's kit, since it has seemed to be responsible for so much
ill success in the catching of commandos, in the cutting-off of the
retreat of Boer armies, and in the raiding of the enemy's
communications.</p>

<p>If you catch a Boer scout or vedette, you will wonder how he
lives&mdash;he has so little of what seems to be regarded as the
very necessaries of existence in our own lines. There are no
wallets on his saddle, there is no heavy overcoat strapped across
his pony's back. There is no rear-pack, or, as perhaps it might be
more correctly named, 'loin-compress,' to hinder the pony's action.
There is no feed-bag to drag the saddle over to one side, so that
it may press unevenly on his back. There is seldom anything but a
bare saddle, without breast-plate or crupper, and a thin blanket
beneath it. Sometimes a light mackintosh is strapped in front, with
a little roll of biltong in a greasy rag. That is almost all. It is
a matter of thirty seconds with him to saddle-up. He carries a
bandolier, sometimes two, filled with the handy Mauser cartridge
clips, over his shoulders. His rifle is slung across his back. His
coat pockets contain a reserve supply of ammunition. And there you
have the complete fighting man, from the Boer point of view. But of
course he is grossly ignorant. If he only knew what was good for
him, he too would resemble a Christmas tree, his movements would be
slow and stately, his fat pony would be as like a hat-rack as ours
became. He has not enjoyed the advantages conferred by a study of
Red Books.</p>

<p>"I," said the British troop horse (according to the Bloemfontein
<i>Friend</i>), "I carry the most complete kit in the world. My master can
make himself comfortable, even in your inhospitable veldt, with the
kit I carry."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Boer pony, "but I can carry my master out of
the way of yours."</p>

<p>And yet, if you think about it, there is nothing in the
equipment of a cavalry soldier on active service which may very
well be dispensed with. He must have his overcoat. He must have his
horse-feed. He must have his arms, and his feed-bag, and his
blanket, and his ammunition. Most of the weighty things he carries
are essential to his health or his arm of the service. They must
all be somewhere within his reach. Cold or exposure would put him
'out of action' in a very short time, if he had no protection
against wet or frosty nights. There must be occasional 'hard' feed
to keep his horse fit for any work at all, and he must be able to
get at his belongings easily when he bivouacs.</p>

<p>How is he to carry his necessaries along with him so that they
are always easily within his reach, and at the same time 'travel
light'? Waggons lag behind; Scotch carts get stuck in drifts. Even
the ubiquitous Cape cart cannot always go over the same kind of
country that he sometimes has to negotiate. There is one answer,
one suggestion, which is not original perhaps, but which seems to
be the only answer or suggestion which may adequately meet the
want. And that is, <i>Pack-horse</i>.</p>

<p>Pack-horses, or light spring-carts&mdash;and the pack-horse has
the virtue of greater mobility to turn the scale in his favour.</p>

<p>It is a fair estimate, and well within the mark, to assume that
one pack-horse could carry the more urgently required effects of
four men&mdash;that is to say, one weight-carrier to each section.
Not all the rations, and horse-feed, and other things which the man
may require on a march of many weeks, but the things which he
cannot do without at night, and hardly needs in the day-time, and
which are only a hindrance to his marching and fighting ability.
There would be then, instead of four, five horses in each
section&mdash;four to carry men, and one to carry baggage. When
cavalry are dismounted for skirmishing, one man of every
four&mdash;the horse-holder, or number three&mdash;is out of
action. It is not very much more difficult to look after five
horses than four. In work where there is a probability of being
under fire, such as scouting or reconnoitring, the pack-leader
might be left behind. There would be fewer men in the line of
scouts, but the men who were there would be lighter, able to travel
farther and faster with their reduced equipment than they are at
present, and possessed of considerably more 'dash'&mdash;the great
essential of a successful scout. Overcoat, waterproof sheet,
cooking pots, anything beside the bare day's rations and
cartridges&mdash;all that is not absolutely of use to the fighting
man&mdash;might go on the pack-horse. And then the trooper, with an
almost stripped saddle and riding as light as may be, would have
some chance of catching his enemy and compelling him to fight. As
it is now, he has very little.</p>

<p>So you mount your feeble steed, already weighed down by a load
as great as yourself, and lurch along to where your troop is
forming up in its squadron and regiment beside other squadrons and
regiments. The advance guard has clattered out, and the outposts
are drawing in to await the column. Other regiments form up to your
left or right; the guns rumble up to their position near the lead.
Carts and waggons begin to move up also into some sort of column
formation. The bivouac-ground is deserted save by the inevitable
laggards or men with sick horses who must follow slowly. Nearly
every one is smoking. Troops are 'told off'&mdash;everything is
ready for the march to begin. In the shadows before sunrise the
dirty, travel-stained khaki figures seem dingier than ever. Dingy
and dirty, but very fit and workmanlike. You sit and shiver, and
wonder why the movement does not begin.</p>

<p>A little stout man on a good horse, followed by a group of
red-collared staff officers, rides slowly through the ranks and up
to the front, eyeing the troops. You sit up straight, and take your
pipe out of your mouth. That little stout man is your father, and
your mother, and your best friend just now, and he
alone&mdash;may-be also one or two of the trim staff&mdash;has any
idea as to what the day is going to bring forth. In an hour or two
you may be dead, or a prisoner, or wounded, or wondering whether
the next shell is going to land under your horse. You don't know
what is going to happen, and use has made you careless. You are
merely the pawn which that cheerful little man moves in the big
game, and he, in his turn, is moved by a little slim man. It
doesn't much matter what the day brings. You have confidence in
French. He never goes wrong or makes a fool of you.</p>

<p>Now you are off&mdash;the horses' legs swish-swishing through
the long grass; the mess-tins rattling against the carbine-butts;
bits jingling musically; the bright sun just peeping over the edge
of the world on your right hand; white puffs of tobacco smoke
drifting up into the clear air. The veldt is turning to burnished
gold. Your bridle-hand is frozen.</p>

<p>All round is laughter, and chaff, and quiet talk. Curious scraps
of conversation drift to you as you ride along.</p>

<p>Strange lies are bandied about as to the doings of Buller. He
has occupied Johannesburg&mdash;no, Harrismith. Mafeking has
fallen. Steyn is dead. De Wet wants to surrender, if they'll
promise not to send him to St. Helena. The probability of getting
full rations soon is discussed, and negatived. The ways of officers
are criticised.</p>

<p>The sun mounts higher and higher, and your hands and toes begin
to thaw. The little black dots of scouts who occasionally come into
view on the far sky-lines are more distinct. Odd men walk along,
leading their horses after them, to keep warm.</p>

<p>On, through the bright morning hours, you ride&mdash;past
white-walled farmhouses, down long, gentle slopes clothed with deep
grasses, by Kaffir kraals whose dusky inhabitants gape with wonder
at the numbers of the rooineks, and where the little pot-bellied
niggers gaze out, goggle-eyed and fearful, from behind their ample
mothers. Sometimes the column narrows into a long procession to
cross a deep spruit, and forms up again slowly into 'mass' upon the
other side.</p>

<p>Barbed-wire fences are encountered. The cry goes up,
"Wire-cutters to the front!" and two or three men from each
squadron race on ahead, and sever the wires with their clippers,
pulling them aside that the Brigade may pass. A thankless job
wirecutting, especially when the bullets are flying. Sometimes the
fences have stone posts&mdash;slabs of a slaty sandstone which the
natives quarry from the hills, and supply to the farmers at
sixpence apiece. Fire-proof fences these, and fairly lasting, one
would think. Here and there a post is broken down. Struck by
lightning, people who know the country will tell you.</p>

<p>A long kopje looms up over the horizon. You are riding towards
it for hours. Distance is strangely foreshortened in this clear
atmosphere. A few miles from it the column halts. The men are
dismounted, and lie down beside their horses. The scouts are riding
on ahead to 'draw fire'. You pillow your head upon your helmet and
go to sleep, whilst your horse crops the grass about you, and
barely refrains from trampling on your prostrate form. A sudden
scramble awakes you. Everybody is mounting again.</p>

<p>The kopje is unoccupied, and you ride on past it. The farmhouse
under its shoulder flies five white flags. A Boer woman comes out
and stares at you stolidly. If the Provost-Marshal and his men do
not seem to be looking, you slip away from your troop, and, while
your messmate haggles with the woman at the doorway over the price
of eggs or mealie-meal, you endeavour to steal a fowl or a
duck&mdash;that is to say, you seek to 'commandeer' them.
Convenient word 'commandeer'. If you are fortunate, you put the
broken-necked bird in your feed-bag, and it represents five pounds
of oats, and is not too inconveniently in evidence.</p>

<p>At noon you halt once more, and eat some biscuits and anything
else that you may happen to have, and take a drink from your
water-bottle, and sleep again on the ground for half an hour or
more.</p>

<p>So all day, the swarm of men and horses, guns and waggons, rolls
across the veldt&mdash;a wide-spreading oncoming&mdash;like a
plague of locusts. On the whole, it is pleasant, and enjoyable, and
lazy. Sitting loose in the saddle, you smoke and yarn, and
speculate as to where you are and what you are going to do, and how
long it will be before you are in Pretoria. You have made up your
mind that Pretoria is to end it all. You are going home
then&mdash;back to the station, or the office, or the store, and
the warm welcome you know is waiting. Perhaps it will be a trip to
England, where you will be <i>fêted</i> and made much of, and generally
given a good time. It is days and days since you heard a rifle
fired; weeks and weeks, perhaps, since a gun boomed out over the
plains. All the Boers have fled to the Vaal&mdash;probably across
it, without stopping, to Johannesburg and Pretoria. There will be a
siege, possibly, for a month. You will sit upon a hill and watch
the shelling. The lyddite will soon bring them to their senses,
once they are fairly bottled up in a town, with the bricks and
stones tumbling about their ears. It is all very simple and
straightforward now. You will be back in time for shearing.</p>

<p>Another kopje rises up ahead. Closer and closer you get to it,
though it is still miles away. A very long one this
time&mdash;camel-backed, and with little foot-hills and clumps of
'wacht-een-beetje' bush in front of it. A single horseman comes
galloping back from where the scouts are, and stops at the staff.
Again the Division halts, and sits down and wonders. Ten minutes,
and you see the Colonel talking to your particular squadron leader.
They argue, and point, and look through glasses, and consult maps.
Finally the Major nods, rolls his map up, picks up his loose reins,
says something sharply that is only audible in the leading troop,
and you suddenly mount, and find yourself riding out from the
middle of the Brigade towards the blue kopje in the distance.
Friendly souls advise you not to stay too long&mdash;not to get
excited. "Meet y' in Pretoria if y' don't come back to-night,"
calls out a humorous acquaintance.</p>

<p>"We're off to stir up th' muck agin," remarks your right-hand
man philosophically.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV - THE KOPJE</h2>

<p>THE Brigade was halted close beside a white farmhouse. There had
been slaughter and rapine in the poultry-yard; bundles of hay had
been looted from the forage-loft. We left them sitting on the
ground beside their horses. The feed-bags with the scanty oats had
been hung on the drooping heads, and all, save ourselves and the
squadron of which our diminished two troops formed part, were
resting, and seemed likely to rest for some hours. While they
rested we were to ride out and 'feel' that long, blue kopje.</p>

<p>Every one knew what the 'business' was from long experience. The
kopje looked peaceful and quiet in the warm afternoon sunlight.
Unless one had seen it all before, and had previous knowledge of
lovely landscapes that spat bullets from apparently nowhere in
particular, one would hardly have expected that an hour or two
would bring one within touch of sudden death. The first time it had
been a riding forth without reason, a light-hearted excursion into
the debatable lands&mdash;an astonished feeling of resentment that
so harmless and smiling a prospect should merely be a mask hiding
an unknown foe. Frequently afterwards the objective had been a
mystery. Troop leaders may have known what they were required to
find out, and how they were going to set about it, and where the
enemy was supposed to be 'lying low,' but the trooper seldom had
any definite notion as to what was to be done, or what was expected
of him. There may have been Mauser-fire, or there may have been
shell-fire to be drawn. He was not consulted in the matter. He was
merely sent out as a bait for bullets. Often recurring experience
of the kind of thing in question had made it familiar. Familiarity
had almost bred contempt. If bullets pass closely by, without
hitting you, on nine separate occasions, you feel tolerably certain
that you will come off scatheless on the tenth.</p>

<p>So you go out, with no serious apprehension as to whether you
will return to camp at night. Sometimes, to be sure, you
don't&mdash;but the chance is so small as to be barely worth
consideration. Usually, you are not even curious as to what the
work in hand may be. It is vaguely probable that it will consist of
the well-known 'drawing fire,' but you don't know for certain, and
after a while you don't care overmuch.</p>

<p>To-day, however, there is no doubt. The wide, yellow veldt
sweeps away to the horizon&mdash;East, West and South unbrokenly.
It is only to the North that the long kopje mars the even symmetry
of the sky-line. You are riding towards it. You are well extended
from your neighbour. A few advanced scouts are in front. You know
what to expect.</p>

<p>The plains are not quite level. Gentle slopes run down, for a
mile or more, into shallow spruits and rain-cut dongas. The waving
grass is dry, and has lost its first freshness by reason of the
frosts. Up from the further side of each donga the ground rises
slowly to another low crest. No ridge is higher than its fellow; no
depression deeper than the one before it. The air is clear and
bright, but the distant landscape is half-veiled by a gauzy, purple
haze, just dense enough to render indistinct horses and men moving
about over two thousand yards away. You might see them, but they
would not be sharply defined targets.</p>

<p>Here and there on the slopes are the humpy, mud-coloured kraals
of the Kaffirs&mdash;'Gunyahs' Tommy Cornstalk calls them. They are
quaint structures, primitive and simple. In shape they are like
hollow globes divided into two halves at the equators, and the
halves planted, pole skyward, on the ground. Sometimes they are
plastered with mud&mdash;a kind of 'wattle and
daub'&mdash;sometimes thatched with grass. A tiny arched hole in
the side, through which it is necessary to crawl in order to enter,
is the only opening. There is no provision for light or
ventilation. Fires, apparently, are made outside. Round the
diminutive doorway there is usually a little wicket fence
constructed of sticks from the scant bushes of the kopjes, or of
mealie-stalks lashed together&mdash;the top of the palisading uncut
and ragged. In occasional more pretentious establishments the fence
surrounds the whole hut. Three-legged cooking pots and gourds are
heaped by the doorway inside. Fowls run in and out of the
enclosure. The ground all about is trampled hard, and seems to be
kept clean and well swept.</p>

<p>Close beside the man-kraals are the
cattle-kraals&mdash;low-walled, square or oblong yards built of the
loose, undressed, unmortared stones that litter the veldt.
Wonderfully well-built and 'plumb' are these stone-age
stock-yards&mdash;laborious of construction probably, but, without
doubt, lamb-proof and dog-proof. A single entrance at one end,
closed by rails, serves to admit the stock.</p>

<p>About the dwellings, as you pass by, are grouped the dusky
family&mdash;the men-kind ranging from bent and white-headed
veterans, who might have beheld the Great Trek or fought the
Voortrekkers, to tiny, podgy fellows just able to walk abroad naked
and unashamed; and the women from withered hags, toothless and
wrinkled, down to bright-eyed little maidens of few summers. In his
prime, the Kaffir is a fine man&mdash;deep-chested,
sturdy-haunched, light-hearted&mdash;and the women, broad-hipped,
deep-bosomed, cavern-mouthed and flat-faced, but not altogether
unpleasing in appearance. The fat, barrel-bodied children goggle
with astonishment and run as you ride by. No bad country this,
where the babies are so fat and the mothers so strong and
comely&mdash;where the mealie crops are sown, and come up and
flourish, in fields that have been but barely scratched by way of
cultivation.</p>

<p>Kaffir kraals are not bad places to drop into when your
haversack is empty and your wallets innocent of sustenance. That is
to say, there is generally something to be had&mdash;if a commando
has not passed that way in retreat, or if there be no Mounted
Infantry ponies hanging to the cornstalk fence, with big wooden,
leather-covered stirrups, and overcoats tied carelessly to the back
of the black saddle with string or oxhide that hang loose over the
horses' flanks. If you see <i>that</i> kind of pony, with <i>that</i> kind of
stirrup, and <i>that</i> method of rolling a cloak, you will know that the
Canadians are within&mdash;and to go a-foraging where the Canadians
are doing likewise, or may have been, argues bad judgment and an
ill-balanced brain.</p>

<p>War is not a nice business, and an empty stomach has no
conscience. Orlando's method of demanding food from the Duke in the
Forest of Arden was rude and brusque, and not to be
extenuated&mdash;but there were points about it. If you have had
nothing to eat since last night, and see no prospect of anything
to-night, few scruples will prevent you from obtaining it in the
most expeditious manner possible&mdash;if it is to be obtained. You
know also that, if you do not take it, some one else will. So you
ride up to your kraal. "Got any mealie, Johnny?" to the head of the
household.</p>

<p>"Nie mealie, baas."</p>

<p>"Any eggs?" (If he doesn't understand, you point to the fowls,
and make gestures.) "Nie, baas."</p>

<p>"Melk?"</p>

<p>"Nie melk, baas."</p>

<p>You draw your carbine from its bucket, insert a cartridge in the
breech, and rest it across your legs. The movement is not lost on
the head of the household. "Any mealie now, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Ja, baas."</p>

<p>"Any eggs?"</p>

<p>"Ja, baas!"</p>

<p>"Any melk?"</p>

<p>"Ja, baas! Ja! ja! ja!"</p>

<p>And mealies, and milk, and eggs are forthcoming from the kraal,
with perhaps a fowl thrown in as a voluntary peace-offering. If you
have any money, you give him some. If you have none, you ride away,
and feel sorry for the Kaffirs, and moralise inwardly on the
iniquity of war and its usages. It is brutal, but imperative.</p>

<p>"Sanguinary rough," says Tommy Cornstalk, "to take the poor
devils' tucker. But I was hungry." And that explains it. One must
live, even at the expense of others. It is simply the law of
self-preservation stripped of the clothing worn by it in
civilisation. You do the same thing every day at home, only you
don't notice it.</p>

<p>The blue kopje draws nearer. Only a mile or two now. There will
be shooting and riding soon. You wonder whether that 'off'
fore-shoe will bring you to grief. You are trotting most of the
time&mdash;that wretched English trot which helps the 'Tommies' to
give their horses sore backs, and which is the only pace these
London cab horses seem to know. They were given to you as remounts
at Bloemfontein, after the race thither and sundry ridings round
Thaba N'chu had used up the last of the good Australians you
shipped at Woolloomooloo a few months back. You feel that you want
a bell or a whistle, in order to get the best work out of your
over-burdened, underfed mount.</p>

<p>By this time you are the fourth part of a 'left flanking
patrol'. The main body of the reconnoitring squadron rides some
distance to the rear of a widely extended line of scouts. You are
level with the squadron, but half a mile further out to the left
than the last of the scouts. It is your business to prevent a
possibly lurking enemy from 'nippin' in behind,' or 'attacking
sideways on'&mdash;as it has variously been put. The squadron is a
little cluster of horsemen, extended also, but not too widely to
render them an unattractive target for artillery. They will draw
the shell-fire, if there be any to be had. The scouts will count
the Mausers.</p>

<p>A mealie field has to be ridden through. There are possibilities
about mealie fields. The stalks are high enough in parts almost to
hide a man on horseback. They may shelter a few hidden
sharpshooters, or they may contain a commando. You open out wider
as you enter, and ride through the rustling ears and leaves with
your loaded rifle ready in your hand.</p>

<p>There is no one there. Just on the further edge is one of those
circular, circus-ring threshing grounds, where the women beat out
the Kaffir corn&mdash;a species of millet with little round seeds
tufting together at its top, from which, when ground between
stones, they make a coarse bread. To-day there are two fat 'gins'
and a girl, so busily engaged in bagging the winnowed seed that you
burst upon them suddenly from amid the mealie crop&mdash;so
suddenly that the eldest and stoutest of the three comes near to
having a fit, and can only gasp and stare at you in an agonised,
helpless way. The girl, shapely and wellmade, comes forward
laughing. But she cannot speak English.</p>

<p>"Where Boers?" you inquire.</p>

<p>"Boos!" she says, catching at the word; "Boos?"</p>

<p>"Ja, Boos! where you think it that pheller him go?" you reply,
dropping unconsciously into Australese. But she can only shake her
head and smilingly bare a gleaming set of perfect teeth. After much
gesture, you are not quite certain whether she means to imply that
the veldt ahead is swarming with Boers, or that they have all
trekked to an indefinite distance, hurriedly and wholesale.</p>

<p>Kaffir information is seldom to be depended upon when you are
scouting. Few people other than the Kaffir will probably assent so
readily to any interrogative address, if it be that he thinks that
a reply in the affirmative will be acceptable to the questioner.
Similarly, if he suppose that 'no' will gratify, he will say no. He
is quite impartial. He will give you any information you please.
Whether it be correct matters not to him, so long as it satisfies
you.</p>

<p>"There are horses in that kraal, aren't there, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Ja, baas."</p>

<p>"You've never seen a horse in your life, have you, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"No, baas."</p>

<p>When in doubt he says "Ja".</p>

<p>"Which would you sooner do or play cricket, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Ja, baas."</p>

<p>One refers, of course, to the Kaffir whose only alien tongue is
Dutch. He is a guileless liar, and generally doesn't know when he
is lying and when he is speaking the truth. At any rate, it is the
safest course, when your life may depend upon it, never to accept
information from a Kaffir as being wholly reliable. You may usually
only arrive at an approximation to the truth by carefully comparing
the lies, and putting two and two together from the whole mass of
fiction.</p>

<p>Half a mile beyond the mealie field and about halfway up the
opposite gentle slope, was a collection of mud huts. The main body
had halted temporarily, so it seemed to the 'left flanking patrol'
an excellent opportunity for supplementing a deplenished larder. A
man remained on his horse a hundred and fifty yards out beyond the
kraal, and the rest cautiously approached the enclosure. It might
have been a trap&mdash;but wasn't.</p>

<p>At the door was the oldest woman in the world&mdash;the oldest
woman who had ever lived in the world. Shrivelled to what might
have been half her size in youth; bent, until her head was almost
lower than her hips; almost without sight or hearing; long skinny
breasts depending loosely and hideously from her shrunken chest;
spindleshanked, nearly naked, unintelligent&mdash;she was not
unlike Gagool of <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>. Crouched in the sun when we
rode up, she seemed hardly to notice us, and remained squatting in
the same place until we went away. It seemed impossible that there
could have been an older man or woman in existence.</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty," said the corporal, "if she's a
day!"&mdash;and indeed she looked it. A white-headed 'Uncle Ned,'
who was probably her grandson, strolled about near her. Little
niggers swarmed all round.</p>

<p>This family seemed particularly impressed by our
appearance&mdash;which was probably picturesque, if not clean.
Almost ere we could requisition anything, a bowl of eggs was
brought, and a gourd full of sweet goat's milk, and, by signs and
jabbering, they tendered the fullest hospitality they had. No need
this time for 'moral suasion,' in the form of rifle loading!</p>

<p>It is perhaps uncharitable to say so, but in the light of
subsequent events their hospitality can hardly seem to have been
anything but a lure&mdash;an encouragement to ride on carelessly,
and to assume that there were no Boers in the neighbourhood by
reason of the Kaffirs' friendliness. Bullets came from that kraal
later in the day, as the reconnoitring party retired. But the eggs
were good, and we sucked them.</p>

<p>The watcher without hailed us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come on, you fellows. The push's going on. Buck up! Wot yer
got?"</p>

<p>So we went on up the rise. Half a mile and the crest was
reached. Keeping step with the main body, we again halted, and
looked out over the wide rolling veldt. The haze was deeper and
more blue now, and the scouts were nearing the long kopje.</p>

<p>From the crest where we were the ground sloped away in a series
of undulations down to a level plain. From the foot of the
slope&mdash;which was scarcely noticeable, and only so because the
curtain of haze seemed to begin there&mdash;the plain reached flat
and far and unbroken, past the kopje we were interested in, to a
distant range of indigo hills. And in the plain manoeuvred two
squadrons of cavalry, moving parallel to and in the same direction
as ourselves.</p>

<p>Whom could they be? We sat and watched them from our saddles,
whilst our own squadron, three-quarters of a mile to the right,
remained stationary.</p>

<p>Now there should have been no British troops so close up on our
left. The First Cavalry Brigade we had come from. To the right of
it was the Fourth. Hutton's Mounted Infantry was behind. It was
just possible, though very improbable, that a couple of companies
of Hutton's men had come up on our left, in order to reconnoitre
the country further to the west. Improbable, because they could
hardly have reached there in the time. However, as it is usual to
send out reconnoitring parties without giving each individual an
intelligent insight into the 'lay of the land,' and the whereabouts
of other divisions, it still remained possible. That they were
using our troop formation, and riding in fairly regular
order&mdash;with advanced scouts out in front&mdash;lent colour to
the supposition that they were British and not Boer. That they were
in a position whither one was almost certain no British troops
could have come without our having discovered them earlier in the
afternoon seemed to point to the fact that they were Boer and not
British.</p>

<p>We sat undecided. Up ahead, the scouts were halted&mdash;tiny
specks of men and horses in the haze&mdash;apparently right under
the long kopje, really half a mile from it. How were we to make
sure of the newcomers on our left? The strange squadrons had halted
likewise by this time. Two or three leaders seemed to be riding
amongst the ranks. We knew not what to make of them. Oh, for the
field-glasses which we should have carried rather than the useless
swords. Presently some twenty detached themselves from the main
body and came riding towards us. More mysterious still! Nearer and
nearer they came. A slight depression hid them from us.</p>

<p>Far away, and faintly from the long kopje, came the quick double
report of a Mauser&mdash;ping-pong. Then again rapidly, ping-pong,
ping-pong, ping-ping, pongpong&mdash;p-r-r-r-r-p&mdash;the scouts
had drawn their fire. Crack-crack,
crack-crack-cr-r-rr-r-r-ack&mdash;cr-r-r-r-r-r-ack&mdash;the
cordite answered, which was contrary to wont. The scouts were
retiring slowly, covering their retreat with rifle-fire. Sometimes
it died away to a single ping-pong or crack; then again it ripped
and rolled across the veldt in a stronger medley of sound. We sat
watching our uncertain neighbours on the left. Their main body had
turned as the scouts turned, and were edging in towards our
rear.</p>

<p>Out of the depression where the twenty had disappeared, eight
hundred yards away, came riding a single big man on a white pony.
No sign was there of the twenty who had started with him.</p>

<p>Said the corporal: "That settles it. They're British, and
they're sending across to find out who the devil we are. Come on!
We'll go and meet him!" So we rode slowly over.</p>

<p>The distance from the hollow became less than six hundred.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better get down and cover the bloke?" some one queried
of the corporal. "He might be a Bore after all. Best not give him
any show."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said the corporal, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Phutt-bang! phutt-bang! (the Mauser only sounds double in the
distance) phutphut-phut-bang-bang-bang!&mdash;bullets came singing
and spitting past our ears and made little red spirits of dust
beyond our horses on the ground.
Phut-phut-phut-t-t-tt-bang-bang-bang-b-r-r-r-r-ump!</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" said the corporal, "time we left. What a sell! Come
on! Files about. They're trying to cut us off!"</p>

<p>Back we went at a hand-gallop, the little spirts of dust and the
phut-phut-phut of the singing nickel growing less frequent and
close as the distance lessened between ourselves and the main body.
The scouts were nearly back to it also now, riding slowly,
apparently out of range of the long, blue, innocent-looking kopje.
No one had been hit. A bullet intended for the 'left flanking
patrol' had sailed merrily overhead, and, almost spent, dropped
into the belly of a horse with the main body. The horse lived and
worked for a week.</p>

<p>That is the inexplicable thing about 'drawing fire'&mdash;how so
little damage is done. All the advantages would seem to lie with
the hidden rifleman whose fire is to be 'drawn'. The horseman is an
enlarging target as he approaches. The man in the rocks may choose
the position for shooting which he fancies best, may select his
favourite range, may pick his man&mdash;but he seldom hits him.</p>

<p>Once, a troop consisting of four-and-twenty men and two officers
went forth to investigate a mine superstructure and a
'tailing-heap,' close by Roodepoort on the Rand. There were from
one hundred to one hundred and fifty Boers in a deep ditch&mdash;a
'surface drive' it would be in Australia&mdash;which lay just
before the buildings. Thirty feet in front of the ditch stretched a
barbed-wire fence, and the ditch was not visible until the fence
was reached. The troop came to the fence, and drew a paralysing
volley. They wheeled and raced. For several hundred yards, before
the slope of the ground hid them from sight, they were under the
rapid Mauser magazine-fire. There were bullets through helmets,
haversacks, clothing, saddlery and two horses&mdash;but that was
all!</p>

<p>Yet, if you think of it, the first shot is the only one that may
be effective. And the marksman generally makes too sure&mdash;just
as you are liable to miss a kangaroo at twenty feet if you don't
take the usual pains over aligning the sights. And when once the
horseman has turned, and is increasing the range with every second,
he is the poorest target possible. You may pump lead at him, but
you don't hit him. You will probably forget to adjust your
back-sight as he alters the range from five to seven hundred
yards.</p>

<p>Another explanation of the often very bad shooting of the Boer
is that the Mauser&mdash;a comparatively new weapon to him&mdash;is
marked in metres, whereas he has learned to shoot in yards with the
old Martini or the American-pattern rifles. But that is as may
be.</p>

<p>The squadron was trotting back by this time to where it had
parted from the Brigade&mdash;scouts as a rear-guard. Away back,
little dots were sliding out of the long kopje and slithering over
the veldt in pursuit. A properly carried out reconnaissance entails
something of the distasteful upon the men who carry it out. It is
unpleasant, and a trifle humiliating, to be chased&mdash;more
natural to stand and fight. But it is the proper game&mdash;to run
when you have drawn the enemy's fire. You are not there to fight
him. You are to find him out, and go back for your big brother to
wallop him.</p>

<p>The 'left flanking patrol' of the advance had become the 'right
flanking patrol' of the retirement, but the retirement was slightly
oblique, and half a mile further east than the line of advance.</p>

<p>Opposite the kraal where Gagool lived more bullets came spitting
by. From near the mealie field another shower. Beyond the mealie
field, the troop leader sent the writer with one man on a pleasant
mission. We were to ride out to the right, six hundred yards, and
see whether there was any donga or spruit where the enemy might be
concealed in order to rake the main body as it passed by.
"Goodbye," said the troop humorously, "see you on the Day of
Judgment!" It seemed likely.</p>

<p>Out six hundred yards there were no bullets. Out fifty more and
the air above our heads hummed with them. But they came from a
cluster of galvanised iron huts nearly a thousand yards away.</p>

<p>The Division was riding up to meet us&mdash;a long line of
horses and khaki. Bang! went a Horse Artillery gun, and the shell
'whooshled' over our heads to check the advancing Boers.
Pom-pom-pom! and the little one-pounders of the Vickers-Maxim
scurried away on the same mission. A few hundred New Zealanders
from Hutton's Brigade rode out in open order and passed through
us.</p>

<p>The Division swung round to the right. Bang! bang!&mdash;a
couple more guns. A premature shell-burst spattered the veldt with
shrapnel just in front of the Maorilanders. We joined the
regiment.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt it had been proved that the long kopje contained
Boers&mdash;'Quod erat demonstrandum'!</p>

<p>The Division moved along down a shallow depression towards a
great dam. We were to bivouac. The fight, if there was one, would
come off next day. From ahead came the rip-rip-rip! of the New
Zealanders' rifles. The Mauser bullets were splashing up the dust
as they fell spent three hundred yards from us. We came to our
camping-ground. The fire died away with the dusk.</p>

<p>There had been an incident which we learnt of only that evening.
As the scouts were advancing, the horse of a shoeing-smith of the
'Greys' had stumbled in an ant-bear hole. The rider's leg was
broken, and his mate stayed with him. When we retired they had been
far off our line of retreat, and had been forgotten. The friend of
the injured man, under a hail of bullets from the on-coming Boers,
had galloped back with the led horse. Up came the Boer Commandant
to where the helpless smith lay.</p>

<p>"What? badly hurt, old man? Sorry; hard luck! Have a drink of
water. Wish I had whisky to offer you!"&mdash;and he passed on,
being in a hurry to get in another shot at the 'verdomde
rooineks'.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V - THE OUTPOST</h2>

<p>If you have ridden all day through the Bush with the thermometer
at one hundred and five degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, you are
naturally pleased at sundown when you dimly realise that here at
last is rest, and a temporary cessation of the overpowering
attentions of the flies. You swing to the ground, glad to stretch
your cramped limbs, slip the saddle from the hack, and the
pack-saddle from the packhorse&mdash;tumbling them anyhow on the
grass&mdash;and proceed to hobble the horses. You collect little
sticks, and make a fire; spread out your blankets, and watch the
quart boil; put in the tea, and thank God that, for eight or nine
hours the small worries of life on the road will not beset you. You
take your hat off, and feel at peace with all men.</p>

<p>To you enter a confounded hairy man. In language less polite
than to the point he intimates that you have camped in his
cultivation paddock; that your parentage is doubtful, and your
bringing-up disastrous; that he has never in his life beheld a
person so divinely dowered with impudence as yourself; and that he
will <i>not</i> feel obliged to you if you remove yourself and your
belongings elsewhere. He will in no wise feel hurt if you decide to
deny his paddock the benefit of your presence for the night, in
fact he insists upon your doing so.</p>

<p>You point out to him that nothing remains of the finest wheat
crop in the district save stubble, that the water-hole in his creek
is the only water to be met with in many miles, that you are
exceedingly fatigued, and that he is a d&mdash;&mdash;d ill-grained
swine. Which latter statement does not placate him, and you are
obliged to go.</p>

<p>It is your own fault. When you jumped that dogleg fence you knew
well that you ran the risk of subsequent ejection by a hairy man.
Trespass was writ large in barbed-wire. It is no more than you
might have expected. Nevertheless, it is the Dead Finish.</p>

<p>When you have ridden all day across the veldt, with the strength
of your mount at one quarter horse-power, you are not sorry when
the Adjutant demands 'markers' from your corps to align the
position of your horse-lines in the camping-ground. You may have
been scouting half the day. You may have been 'drawing fire,' or
fighting a wearisome and desultory rear-guard action. Your rations
may have been in the raw, as uncooked meat and flour; and by reason
of not having had sufficient halting space all day to prepare them
for consumption, you may have gone hungry. You may have been
looking forward to getting the burden of saddlery and kit off your
weary beast, and giving him to eat what little of oats remains in
your attenuated feed-bag. You may have been fortunate in the matter
of loot, and have a fowl in your haversack, together with a few
potatoes and a little mealie-meal in your wallets. The bandolier,
with sixty cartridges, and water-bottle, and haversack will have
been cramping your shoulders. You are looking forward to a good
'feed,' and a subsequent pipe beside the fire you are going to
kindle out of the fence-post you have carried in front of you for
the last hour or more. And then the fine sleep you will
have&mdash;the welcome, friendly forgetfulness&mdash;when you can
dream that you are back again in a land of peace once more, where
there are no homes wrecked, and you must go out of your way a
little to stumble across misery and distress.</p>

<p>When you have found your lines, and driven in your picket-peg
with the hilt of your sword, and unstrapped your overcoat and
rear-pack, and taken off your saddle and 'dressed' it with the
others in a line in front of the horses, under the direction of a
pedantically accurate sergeant-major, you feel that here, at least,
is peace, that for a few precious hours you will be left to
yourself and the attendance upon your own very pressing personal
needs.</p>

<p>To you enter an execrable hairy man. In brief but unanswerable
terms he warns your troop for 'outpost'. As an afterthought, he
enjoins upon you the necessity for 'looking slippery'. Your single
swearword speaks volumes. You will roll your coat again; you will
strap up your rear-pack; you will adjust the many-buckled saddlery;
you will don the harness of water-bottle, and haversack, and
bandolier once more. You will mount and ride again, and above all
you will look forward joylessly to a night without food or fire,
and an interrupted sleep. This again is the Dead Finish.</p>

<p>There are few colloquialisms more expressive of wearisome
disgust, dissatisfaction and discontent than is 'Dead Finish'. It
is almost synonymous with 'the Last Straw'.</p>

<p>The troop goes out. There are twelve men, a sergeant and a
couple of corporals with a subaltern officer in charge. Everything
is carried as on the march. The Adjutant will accompany your
officer to point out to him the position you are to take up. It is
almost dark. Behind, as you ride out over the veldt, glimmer the
little fires of the bivouac, and the subdued hum is wafted to you
of thousands of men busy with the preparation of their evening
meal.</p>

<p>A simultaneous whinny from the lines tells you that the
feed-bags are being put upon the horses. The metallic
click-click-click of a picket-peg being driven in sounds faint and
far away. Presently you rise over what is the skyline from the
camp, and are alone in the night. Miles and miles ahead a single
starlike gleam marks some far off Boer watch-fire. Out in the east,
over the long kopje of the day's work, the sky is paling. There
will be moonlight soon.</p>

<p>What a deuce of a distance we are going out to-night! It seems
hours and hours since we saddled up disgustedly and left the
lines&mdash;the luxurious lines, where there is food, and rest, and
sleep. There will be an issue of bully-beef to-night, and we shall
miss it. If the carts come up, it is rum night. We shall miss that
also. D&mdash;&mdash;n outpost! D&mdash;&mdash;n everything! What
is it all worth&mdash;this weary, worked out, unsatisfactory old
war? Why not have stayed at home, and lived the old life
unbrokenly? We would be sitting down to dinners and teas
now&mdash;in clean shirts and more or less fine raiment. There
would have been a good smoke, a game of billiards, a theatre, a
dance, music, newspapers&mdash;and then, a warm bed with clean
sheets on it. Think of it&mdash;clean sheets! Clean sheets and a
full stomach&mdash;surely that is heaven!</p>

<p>Why couldn't England have 'bucked up' and fought her old war
herself? We're not getting anything out of it. We're losing time,
and money, and place. We have made ourselves liable to be spoken to
as though we were serfs and not free Australians by any bumptious
boy calling himself 'Second Lieutenant'. Second Lieutenant! Ye
gods&mdash;by any 'bounder' of a sergeant-major, by any cocky
corporal, by any new-chum wearer of the lance stripe. We have dug
latrines, and buried mules, and made graves. We are crawling with
vermin. We are tired, and stiff, and hungry, and we are going out
'on outpost'.</p>

<p>Why did we ever come? This isn't charging into battle. This
isn't racing through a flying foe. This isn't getting the Victoria
Cross. Where is all the 'pomp and circumstance of war'? Where are
the bands and the martial music to play us into action? Where are
the clouds of drifting smoke we've read about? Where's that 'thin
red line,' and all those gorgeous uniforms that used to make war
picturesque, and romantic, and spectacular? Where's anything but
dirt, and discomfort, and starvation, and nigger-driving? Who wants
to participate in a shabby war like this?</p>

<p>Oh, you growling swine, Tommy Cornstalk! If you had been
rejected, been sent home from Randwick because of your varicose
vein or your hollow tooth; fallen off your horse in the riding
test, or failed to hit the target when you were tried on the
range&mdash;you know well what it would have meant. Can't you think
of how you would have gone back to the station or the township,
downcast and shame-faced? Don't you remember how lucky you thought
you were when you marched down George Street to the 'trooper'? What
about the hour or two when all the people were howling mad over
you, when the girls you didn't know came and kissed you, when the
effusive males who didn't go themselves handed you bottles of beer
to quench the magnificent thirst you had cultivated betwixt the
barracks and the boat? How did you feel then? Don't you
really&mdash;deep down in your heart&mdash;consider that you are
getting your reward?</p>

<p>Isn't it something to be marching, and fighting, and starving
with these Englishmen? Supposing that they are the scum of
England&mdash;if they are&mdash;isn't it something for a one-horse
volunteer crowd like you to be a squadron of such a regiment as the
one you are with&mdash;a regiment which was fighting before there
was an Australia, a regiment which saw Waterloo and Balaclava? And
another thing&mdash;isn't it something to have shown a regiment
like that how to scout, how to take cover, how to ride, how to
shoot; how, in short, to play this particular game as it should be
played, and in the only way by which there is possibility of
success? Isn't that something, you discontented dog?</p>

<p>Go&mdash;go out to your comfortless outpost. Have no supper.
Make no fire. Just take your two hours' watch, and your four hours'
sleep in your lousy blanket, and thank God that you are privileged
to be here&mdash;yes, privileged&mdash;instead of reading about it
in newspapers and books, and not knowing.</p>

<p>The position assigned to the outpost is just below the skyline
of another ridge. One can hardly speak of these almost invisible
elevations as 'ridges'. The plain, when you ride over it, seems
nearly quite level, and viewed from afar it seems to be so also;
but there are little watersheds in it which form the ridges and the
valleys, and the dongas in the valleys. If you are on a crest, you
see more land, and the horizon is farther off than when you are
below it. It is not unlike a calm sea, with just a long swell
humping it up into faintly visible hillsides of wave and
trough&mdash;level as a whole, but not in detail. An outpost placed
upon the summit of one of these 'waves' would be conspicuous
against the sky to an enemy approaching from the front.
Accordingly, it is usually stationed a hundred or two hundred yards
below the crest, and sentries are placed out far enough to command
a view of the country from which attack may be expected. When you
have come to your allotted place in the ring of outposts you are
'numbered off' from the right.</p>

<p>"One, two and three&mdash;first relief; four, five and
six&mdash;second relief; seven, eight and nine&mdash;third relief,"
says the sergeant. That is to say, that the first three men will
furnish the first round of sentries, who will do duty for two hours
until relieved by the second group. Their places, in turn, will be
taken by the third. Thus, the first sentries will have four hours
in which to sleep before being called up again. Each corporal will
take one of two of the remaining, and patrol between his own and
the next post at three&mdash;or four&mdash;hourly intervals. The
odd man will be kept as an emergency. He is liable to be called and
sent out at any hour, but as a rule has a full night's sleep. His
is the lightest 'duty' in the outpost, but may quite easily become
the hardest, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>From a larger outpost, 'Cossack posts' are often sent out. A
'Cossack-post' consists of a N.C.O. and three men, who picket their
horses a considerable distance from the main post, and provide one
sentry at a time. They are usually placed in isolated positions,
where it would be unwise to risk a larger body of men, or between
two posts, when the distance separating them is greater than
usual.</p>

<p>The two first sentries are stationed some two hundred yards out
in front, and from two to four hundred yards apart. The third man
of the relief watches over the horses, and is ready to rouse his
sleeping comrades in case of an alarm. He carries a time-piece, if
such a thing is available, and, five minutes before his two hours
expire, calls the sergeant, who posts the next three men. Each of
the corporals takes his man and rides out to find the right or
left-hand post&mdash;a by no means easy task in this open veldt,
where an absence of landmarks and similarity of country tax one's
powers of 'bushcraft' to the utmost. After placing his sentries,
and giving them the countersign, the officer in charge returns to
his post with the sergeant. The sergeant's duties for the remainder
of the night consist of 'marching' the reliefs every two hours. He
is also responsible to the officer for the conduct of affairs, and
the correct timing of the goings out of the 'reliefs' and
'patrols'.</p>

<p>The moon has risen over the dark hump of the long kopje. The
worn out, still saddled horses cast weird shadows over the
grass&mdash;one or two lying down, the others forlornly engaged in
cropping so much of it around their pegs as the head-ropes will
allow. The men have put on their overcoats&mdash;those excellent
cavalry cloaks which are the best part of the equipment&mdash;and
are busy unrolling waterproof sheets and in slipping their blankets
from beneath the saddle. Strictly, the blankets should remain where
they have been all day, but these nights are too cold to lie down
without some means of warmth other than this cloak, and so the loss
of them is risked by their owners. Should the post be rushed, or
attacked, there would be no time to remove the saddles and replace
the blankets beneath them, and they would have to be abandoned,
unless carried away on their owners' arms. Fortunately, however,
for the comfort of outposts, Boers do not often attack. When they
do, there is usually no 'get away'.</p>

<p>The outpost is tired to-night, and does not talk much. There has
been no tea, because it was too late to light fires. Nothing to
eat, either, but a possible biscuit. Some one was to have come from
the camp with bully-beef, but seems to have lost the way, or not to
have started. So it is a far from hilarious outpost. A man is
speaking in low tones on the subject of dealing with coloured
races.</p>

<p>"W'en me brother Mick was in Mason's survey camp&mdash;doin'
axeman&mdash;he come across a cove out near Walgett who had a black
feller with him drovin'. This bloke useter bring cattle in from
Queensland ter Muswellbrook. Went by the name o'
Kale&mdash;K-a-l-e&mdash;rum name. Useter give th' nigger a quid a
month and his rations. Good enough for a nigger, too.</p>

<p>"Ev'ry now 'n-then, th' nigger useter wanter be settled up with,
an' Kale'd look at a book an' pretend to be squarin' up his
account. 'Well, Jacky,' Kale'd say, 'y' got a pound er terbacca on
the fifteenth?'&mdash;'Yes, that right,' Jacky'd say. 'Well, that's
a pound y' got, an' a pound y' didn't get, ain't it?'&mdash;'Yes,
alright,' Jacky'd say. 'That's two pound, ain't it?' Kale'd arst
him.&mdash;'Yes, that right,' Jacky'd say. 'That's eight bob,'
Kale'd say.</p>

<p>"'Well, Jacky, here's another item,' Kale'd say. 'You got five
bob on the twentyfirst?'&mdash;'Yes.' 'Well, that's five bob you
got, an' five bob you didn't get, eh?'&mdash;'That right.' 'Well,
that's ten bob,' Kale'd say.</p>

<p>"'On the thirtieth y' got a dozen o' matches,' Kale'd
say.&mdash;'Yes, that right,' Jacky'd say. 'That's a dozen y' got,
an' a dozen y' didn't get, ain't it now?'&mdash;'Yes, that right,
Mista Kale,' Jacky'd say.</p>

<p>"'Well, that's nineteen bob, ain't it?'&mdash;'Yes, that right.'
'Well here's th' balance, Jacky. Don't get drunk on it,' Kale'd
say&mdash;an' gave the pore dam nigger a bob. The black boy'd
wonder how it was he never seemed to have anything owing to him,
but he was too 'plurry plash' to let on he didn't know all about
it.</p>

<p>"Now, all niggers are too 'plurry plash,' so I carn't make out
w'y the English Government gives these drivers on our transport
four-ten a month w'en they could get 'em for a quid, an' dust 'em
down over that too. Y' <i>mus'</i> keep niggers down. If y' let a nigger
think he's 's good's a white man, y' can't do nothing with him.</p>

<p>"Now, there's that cove Frank on our cart. All that push that
play cards under the cart of a night lets him chip in. They say to
him: 'Y' black swine! '&mdash;an' he answers back an' calls 'em
'white swine,' an' they on'y laugh. Frank was goin' inter
Bloemfontein one day, an' he met a bloke from the 'Carles,' an'
seys, 'Hullo, you white swine!' So the bloke from the 'Carles' up
an' knocks him down. I reckon Frank was never more s'prised in his
life. He jus' lay there hollerin', an' singing out: 'All right,
baas, I didn't say it again, I didn't say it again'. But it was
their fault&mdash;those coves that'd encouraged him to reckon he
could chaff any white&mdash;&mdash;" and so forth.</p>

<p>You may light your pipe before turning in, if you like, provided
that you do not make too great a glare of light. You must cover
your head with the blanket when you strike the match. What a
blessed thing tobacco is, after you have got past the first sharp
stage of hunger! If you smoke a pipe, and tighten your belt a hole
or two, you may imagine you have eaten a good
dinner&mdash;supposing you have a very vivid imagination.</p>

<p>Soon every one on the post is sleeping the deep, wholesome sleep
of the thoroughly tired. You go to bed with your bandolier on, and
your carbine close at hand, on outpost. Neither do you remove boots
or spurs. The sentry on the horse lines walks up and down, and
prays for relief.</p>

<p>Down where the other sentries are it is very still and lonely.
Of all the occupations of active service to which the private
soldier is liable, there is none so arduous and responsible as that
of a sentry on the line of outposts. He is in the front rank of the
army. Nothing lies between him and the enemy. On his alertness rest
the safety and the lives of his comrades. They may only sleep
securely if he be wakeful and watchful. If he sleep, if he relax in
his vigilant outlook he endangers not only his own worthless self,
but his comrades in the outpost, the Brigade behind him, the Army
itself&mdash;even the Empire, when it only needs another reverse or
two to draw the intervention of a foreign power.</p>

<p>There is no offence in the calendar of soldier's crimes more
heinous or far-reaching in its possible consequences than a
sentry's neglect of his duty. No punishment can be too great for
the man who sleeps upon his post. There can be no excuse, no
extenuating circumstances. Even should he be kept awake for seven
nights in succession, he should be shot without mercy if he slumber
on the eighth, whilst a sentry in a responsible position. One may
be sorry for him. His may be the hardest and most pitiable case in
the world, but his punishment should be death&mdash;not so much
because of the actual personal offence of which he has been guilty,
as for an example to deter other men from doing likewise.</p>

<p>And, strange as it may seem, this is the actual view of nearly
every soldier in the army. There was a story at Modder River of a
man who slumbered on his post and was awarded seven years' gaol,
whilst his friends&mdash;the men of his own
regiment&mdash;clamoured for his death.</p>

<p>A sentry who sleeps on his post has committed the unpardonable
sin. On the other hand, it is almost as criminal for a commanding
officer to detail men who have not recently had a fair amount of
rest for this onerous duty as it is for the sentry to sleep.
Sentry-duty should not come more frequently than once in three
nights.</p>

<p>You begin your watch heavy with sleep. That is the dangerous
period, when you are most liable to yield. You hear the sergeant
and the man whose place you have taken 'swish-swishing' through the
grass back to the post. You are hardly awake yet. The sergeant has
warned you not to stand upright as a mark for possible 'snipers,'
but you feel yourself that to sit down would be almost to court
slumber. So you walk up and down, with your carbine at the
'support' across your body, and your face turned Boerwards
half-interestedly. You stumble over tussocks of grass and bump into
ant-hills, and wonder vaguely why you are there and whether the
time will pass quickly until your turn comes for more sleep.
By-and-bye a realisation that the night is cold, and sharp, and
frosty thoroughly awakens you.</p>

<p>The moon, well in its third quarter, is flooding all the veldt
with its silvery illusive light. The long kopje looms up under
it&mdash;black, mysterious, ominous. Away, very far away in the
distance, the range of hills you had seen when scouting this
afternoon&mdash;or was it yesterday afternoon?&mdash;rises,
light-bathed and ethereal, out of a low-lying sea of faint white
mist. To the rear, a few thinly twinkling points of light mark a
wing of the British camp&mdash;Hutton's Brigade probably. You
cannot see your own. The outpost is not visible either from where
you are. On your right, a tiny black spot shows the position of the
other sentry. The uncanny stillness of the night gets on to your
nerves. You feel terribly alone.</p>

<p>You see something dark and dim out in the long grass. It is
vague, ill-defined, shadowy. What can it be? For a moment it looks
like a crouching man. You half-expect the flash of a rifle and the
sing of a bullet. You watch, and watch, and strain your eyes with
watching&mdash;until they fill with tears, and you have to rub them
clear again. There is another one five yards away, and another to
the other side, and another, and another&mdash;a whole line of
silently advancing Boers!</p>

<p>How uncertain this moonlight is! Is it time to fire? If one
could only consult with the other sentry about them. What is he
doing? The silly fool seems to be just walking up and down. Can't
he see them? Won't it be better to shoot first and challenge
after?</p>

<p>The long range of hills afar off flickers, and curls and warps
up into the sky as your eyes swim again. They must be men, but why
don't they advance, or fire, or do something?</p>

<p>You kneel down in the grass and rest your carbine over an
ant-hill, and then you silhouette the square top of a stone
fence-post against the sky, and wonder why you didn't think of it
before, and the other Boers evolve themselves into stone
fence-posts too.</p>

<p>Half an hour must be gone by now&mdash;no, three-quarters. It
seems ages since the sergeant went away. If one could only do
something to keep back the sleepiness. It is cold sitting down,
too. You get up and walk again.</p>

<p>How about a smoke? Risky, reprehensible&mdash;but you must have
one. It doesn't do to show a light towards the outpost, lest the
lieutenant see you and become annoyed. It won't do to show one to
the front, lest the Boers be close at hand and fire possible
volleys. So you fill your pipe&mdash;a difficult matter when your
fingers are frozen stiff. What of matches? There are some loose in
your haversack&mdash;the last of their kind. They are wooden ones,
but you have a bit of striking paper from the side of the box
stowed away in your helmet. You crouch down behind an ant-heap.
Then you lay your helmet on the ground with the apex pointing to
your front. Unbuttoning your overcoat, you pull the collar up over
your head. Kneeling, you strike the match in the helmet, and puff
vigorously at the pipe. With your hand over the bowl, you rise up
cautiously. The white smoke curls up into the frosty moonlight. You
feel more wakeful and content.</p>

<p>It must be freezing now. Down in Bloemfontein people had said,
"Wait until you start again in the winter. That's when you'll feel
it. Why, half the army will be frozen to death before you cross the
Vaal&mdash;and when you do cross it, and get into the High Veldt,
you won't be able to live for cold." And it is cold. But gloriously
healthy. Use accustoms you to it. Were one sleeping in a warm house
every night, it would be suicide, almost, to lie out with only one
thin blanket in these white frosts, but after three or four months
of roofless, open-air living it is no great hardship. Except when
it rains.</p>

<p>Something is coming over the veldt up on your left&mdash;two men
on horseback, talking together in low tones. The patrol coming in.
Up they ride to within fifty yards of you. You challenge: "Halt!
who goes there?"&mdash;"Friends." "Advance one and give the
countersign." One of them rides slowly on, the other remaining
where he is. "Pelican," says the corporal; "warm weather, ain't
it?" His companion rides past, and they return to the outpost. You
envy them.</p>

<p>Amongst the many stories which one heard of a certain
well-advertised London volunteer corps, it was related that a
member of it, being on 'sentry-go,' was approached in the 'wee sma'
hours' by his commanding officer. The sentry was not able, by
reason of an impediment in his speech, to challenge properly.
"S-t-t-op! w-h-o-'s that?" he inquired nervously. "Friend," came
the reply. "M-m-m-well, c-ccome up to the counter, and sign"!</p>

<p>In the fulness of time, after you have been thinking that all
upon the post are asleep, and yourself a fixture until morning, you
descry the relief coming out. You challenge, and get the
countersign as a matter of form, and then go back to your downy
couch. If you haven't taken the precaution to cover up your blanket
with the waterproof sheet, you will find it wet with frost when you
crawl beneath it.</p>

<p>Four more hours, and you are out again. It seems like five
minutes since you came in. Your first watch was from ten o'clock
until twelve. You have slept from midnight to four in the morning.
And the end of this two hours brings you to the new day. You are
relieved just in time to roll your coat and replace it upon the
saddle, and to adjust your blanket and waterproof sheet. No time to
light fires&mdash;the Brigade is moving early. So, if you possess a
biscuit, you eat it as you prepare to move off, and mount and ride
again upon an unfed horse&mdash;which is the 'crown of a sorrow's
sorrow'.</p>

<p>Once an outpost of Australians were doing duty near Boesman's
Kop by Bloemfontein. There were no rations, nor any apparent
prospect of any. A cow at daylight passed close by a sentry on her
way to water at a dam. A happy thought came to him&mdash;that cow
was probably a Boer. So he decided to take no risks, and shot her
dead. There were rations that day. They came from the cow, in the
shape of beefsteaks. How was the sentry to know, when the cow
didn't answer his challenge, that she was not a kind of 'wooden
horse of Troy'? He could risk no surprises.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI - THE BIVOUAC</h2>

<p>This morning the place was bare, and empty, and desolate, save
for the white farmhouse beside the great stone-banked dam&mdash;and
it added, if anything, to the desolation.</p>

<p>Some 'Jan' or 'Piet' had come galloping across the veldt at noon
with news of oncoming rooineks, who poured over the country like a
swarm of locusts, eating up and devouring everything that lay in
its path&mdash;ruthless, overpowering, merciless alike to women,
and children, and aged people.</p>

<p>They were so many nothing could stand against them. Their
shrapnel searched every kopje and cluster of rocks. They had left
the railway, and were sweeping on alone in the open veldt. It was
not true that the Englishmen got lost and died when they went away
from the railway. It was not true that they had used up all the
horses from England before they had come to Bloemfontein. All those
men had horses&mdash;many horses, and waggons, and cannon.
Yesterday they had fired a Maxim-Nordenfeldt into Sarel Du Ploy's
garden, and had killed Tantie Du Ploy's best cow.</p>

<p>It was not true that they had no Maxim-Nordenfeldts. They had
one, at any rate, for a little devil had cut his hat's
rim&mdash;here, at the side. See it!</p>

<p>Tantie must trek. The Kaffirs must inspan the oxen. There was no
time. Even now, their scouts were not two hours away. Yes,
yes&mdash;she must go. Would she wait to be misused by these
'verdomde rooineks'? Would she wish to see her babies tossed on the
spear-heads of the wicked lancers, her home rent, and riven, and
burnt over her head?</p>

<p>White flags! What of white flags? They no longer cared about
them. Why, they had had three of them over Du Ploy's chimneys when
they fired upon the English scouts&mdash;and yet the little devils
of Maxim-Nordenfeldts had come&mdash;crack-crackcrack&mdash;into
the garden, and they had had to run like Kaffirs to get away from
them. The Englishmen had become 'slim' themselves in the matter of
white flags. Last week a lyddite bomb had blown to pieces Hans
Larsen and his son, as they fired from a kraal over which they had
taken the precaution to mount a white shirt. No, she must not
talk&mdash;she must trek.</p>

<p>It is that 'kerel' French who is coming, and, almighty, but he
comes quickly, and no one knows whence. He must be off soon to warn
others. Let her inspan at once. It was no time for waiting.</p>

<p>And the poor woman has inspanned, and piled her best belongings,
with her babies, on the waggons; and has gone, white-faced but
unweeping, before the vague terror of the accursed rooinek, whom,
the predicant has told her, knows no respect for wife, or maiden,
or mother, or little child. And to-night her house shelters a
General of Division.</p>

<p>From the little farm it must seem a strangely altered scene this
evening. Where, at sunrise, a few oxen grazed quietly, and were the
only living things for many miles, the veldt is covered by a great
gathering of men and horses. Away to the left, the blue smoke of
another great camp hangs like a thin veil above the land, and, back
in the rear, there is another brigade guarding the immense convoy
which keeps on coming in until long after dark.</p>

<p>Our own camp is half a mile long or more; and nearly as deep as
long, with its guns, and waggons, and red cross ambulances. Mules
linked together in fours and fives are being driven to water by
yelling and screaming Kaffir boys. The far side of the big dam in
the hollow is fringed with drinking, bare-backed horses.
Wild-looking men in khaki chase squawking fowls about the huts of
the Kaffir farm-servants. An unkempt ruffian in a torn shirt is
cutting the throat of a squealing pig behind the house. Horses are
tied to the big willow tree.</p>

<p>Red lapelled staff officers come and go from the front rooms.
Now and then a dapper little man in yellow riding boots walks out
upon the stoep, and says something that causes men to spring to
take papers from his hand, and mount, and ride away at breakneck
speed. An anxious-looking colonel dismounts stiffly from his horse,
hands the reins to a trumpeter who has come with him, and walks
inside. Soon he reappears with the dapper General, talking quickly
in a low voice. The General holds a half-unrolled map in his hand.
He spreads it out on his knee, uses his forefinger as an emphatic
pointer, and appears to be insisting upon something. The colonel
smiles and nods, and seems to have comprehended. Whereat the little
red-faced, stout man is apparently pleased. He goes inside again
with a cheery "All-right. Good-night." Johnny French must have
another of those wonderful movements of his simmering in his
brain.</p>

<p>Somehow, French doesn't strike you with any idea of his being
the smart man he is&mdash;except when you notice the shrewd,
twinkling little eyes that seem to take in everything about him. He
certainly does not look the ideal cavalry leader. There is nothing
of the Brigadier Gerard in his appearance. Short, dumpy,
jaunty&mdash;sitting a horse rather like the proverbial sack o'
flour; if you saw him booted and spurred in Cape Town you would
almost put him down as a colonel of infantry, who had learned to
ride from a Red-Book in a riding-school at considerable pains. And
yet, they say he is a hunting man, and rides straight enough. In
dress and person he is always neat. When you salute him he returns
it courteously with a smiling face. When he finds fault there is,
one hears, no mistaking his meaning. Staff-signallers will tell you
that his vocabulary does not lack of means of emphasis. They relate
a tale of how he had once spoken to a luckless Brigadier who had
contrived to mask the guns of 'French's Pets' in a certain action,
and it was said that the recipient of his address seemed to pray
for the advent of a six-inch shell by way of a change of subject.
It was probably not true, but they report him to have inquired
sarcastically as to whether the Brigadier was of any possible use
whatever, whether he could lead ducks any better than he could lead
cavalry, and to have finished with a simple statement to the effect
that the youngest subaltern in the other Brigade could lead that of
the gentleman in question better far than he could himself.</p>

<p>He is a wonderful little man. Except in the one matter of
considering that horses are made of iron and can thrive better on
long and rapid marches than on oats, his men give him credit for
never making a mistake. The trust and pride of the private soldier
of his Division in his infallibility and achievements pass all
understanding. Whatever may be the work in hand, every one feels
absolutely confident that, though it may not always succeed as
fully as expected, it will never be bungled so long as 'Johnny' has
control of it. And if, in any of the towns, the surrendered Boers
should ask you whom you serve under, and you reply, "French," they
will gape at you as being something above the common run of
'rooineks'.</p>

<p>He has acquired an almost demoniac reputation amongst the Boers
for being able to be in two places at once. "What is the use?" they
say. "We dig trenches, and place cannon, and keep the khakis back
for hours; and with our spy-glasses we think we see his cavalry
lurking behind&mdash;but, presently, round he comes on our line of
retreat, and we are obliged to trek quickly, lest we be caught and
hemmed in, as was Cronje at Paardeberg."</p>

<p>In the lines the horses are eating their evening oats, and the
men all busy cooking. It is a curiously interesting and picturesque
scene.</p>

<p>When you look at a bivouac at night Modern War loses its
modernity. Smokeless powder, seven-mile ranges, unseen
death&mdash;all the adjuncts of our civilised methods of settling
disputes are hidden away in the darkness. There are only the little
twinkling fires, the tired horses, the hungry men, the smell of
cooking, the quiet voices and the laughter and snatches of song
just as it might have been a thousand years ago. Whether men kill
one another with axes or with magazine rifles, they are still men.
They must sleep, and eat, and be cold. The English camp on the
night before Agincourt couldn't have been very much different to
this in appearance. It makes you feel somehow that, after all, we
haven't improved very much in the centuries. There are railways,
and steamships, and electricity, and adequate drainage in cities,
and 'heaps' of other ways of making life more healthy and
agreeable&mdash;but, in the end, when we want to settle a question
between individuals or nations we come back to our own nature, and
settle it still after the manner of the beasts of the field and the
fowl of the air.</p>

<p>There are three regiments, with from three to four squadrons
apiece, in the Brigade, and a battery of Horse Artillery. Each
regiment is in 'mass' formation with regard to its
squadrons&mdash;that is to say the leading troop of the squadron is
on the front line, and the others behind it, in succession, to the
rear&mdash;so that the squadrons lie side by side, and are of about
the same depth. Every horse is allowed sufficient space to ensure
him non-interference on the part of his neighbour. Between the
parallel squadrons a narrow street is left. Between the regiments
the streets are a little wider. Behind each squadron is its
transport, and behind that again the transport of the regiment as a
whole. In rear of all are the Army Service waggons, and a little
way aside of them the ambulance vans neatly dressed in line The
battery is usually on the right of the Brigade&mdash;with its guns
and ammunition-waggons in rear. Seen from a distance, the whole
seems to be a little more than a large cluster of men, horses, guns
and waggons, jumbled together anyhow&mdash;but when you come closer
you will see that all is duly ordered, that everything has its
place and allotted position.</p>

<p>Almost in front of all are the little 'one man' green and white
tents of the officers, and just beyond them the headquarters of the
Brigade, where good 'Uncle Tom'&mdash;most popular of
Brigadiers&mdash;shows his red lamp o' nights.</p>

<p>The dingy saddles and arms are arrayed in order&mdash;each
saddle before its horse, and the whole line 'dressed' correctly. It
is only a 'one night' camp, and so there are not many of the tiny
blanket-dwellings&mdash;built with swords and carbines and
bridlereins&mdash;such as spring up when the march is checked for a
day or two. Men are moving about with jackets unbuttoned and
puttees removed, and are a motley, shabby crowd enough.</p>

<p>Dreadful to contemplate, horrible to relate, but necessary to
mention if one would seek to give a truthful picture of the minor
aspects of a campaign, are the efforts of mankind in African
warfare to rid themselves of the loathsome vermin which infest
clothing and blankets and person, and every moment of existence. It
is a shocking state of affairs, and few escape&mdash;even though
there are some who will not acknowledge its existence, as far as
they themselves are concerned. One consolation men offered
themselves&mdash;that the plague was of the veldt, and therefore
unavoidable.</p>

<p>Insecticide is no good. Neither do cleanly habits mitigate the
evil. There is but one means of keeping down the population. You
must hunt, and you must kill. And so, when you behold half-naked
men seated upon their kits, earnestly and laboriously scanning
their shirts, and grunting with satisfaction at intervals, you will
understand what it means. When a column halts in the afternoon in
order to bivouac for the night, one of the first things infested
men do is to squat down on the ground, pull off their shirts, and
seek what they may find.</p>

<p>One feels almost apologetic for having written of such a
subject, but it is just as much a feature of warfare as are
battles&mdash;more so, even, than battles, for the battles are
simply occasional episodes, but the 'Scots Greys,' or 'Roberts'
Horse,' as they have been almost universally termed, like the poor,
are always with you.</p>

<p>The name bestowed upon these awful insects is not complimentary
to the Second Dragoons&mdash;but it may have been the motto of that
gallant regiment&mdash;'Second to None'&mdash;which suggested the
comparison to the original libeller. The 'Greys' of the veldt are
certainly 'second to none'.</p>

<p>Fuel was always a problem. If you could get a post, or half a
post, you were indeed fortunate. It meant comparative luxury. You
might cook&mdash;supposing there was anything to be
cooked&mdash;and after that you could sit round the tiny blaze and
feel that there really was some comfort left in the world after
all. It was cheerful, even, to look at the warm glow of two little
burning sticks. Sometimes you got part of a door, or a window-sash,
or a flooring-board. A baby's cradle, the leg of a piano, a railway
sleeper&mdash;anything that would burn was worth its weight in
transport.</p>

<p>The Boers themselves depend for their fire on an evil
composition known as 'mest'. It is essentially dried cattle dung,
and you may see it in process of manufacture for the market in the
Kaffir locations in any of the towns. They collect the raw material
on the veldt, or in the cattle kraals, puddle it up in tubs with
water, cut it into cakes, and stack it to dry in the sunlight. It
is not the pleasantest thing in the world to cook with, but once
alight it gives out a good heat, and in a country where wood is so
scarce and valuable that stone posts are cheap for fencing, the
possibility of obtaining even such a fuel as 'mest' is something to
be thankful for.</p>

<p>Biscuit-boxes are excellent kindling fuel, but difficult to
obtain, and transitory and uncertain in their effectiveness.
Moreover, they are the peculiar perquisites of Quarter-master
sergeants and cooks, and unless you are a gifted thief you are not
frequently able to get away with them. Railway sleepers are solid
and lasting, but, being saturated with tar, burn smokily and with
prejudicial effect upon the taste of rations cooked in their
flames.</p>

<p>Best of all are the wooden fence-posts. They are not 'split,'
but are the solid round trunks of blue gum saplings, and they burn
with the fragrant scent you know so well&mdash;so that if you shut
your eyes, as you sit round the fire smoking, visions of 'somewhere
else' come to you dreamily across the months.</p>

<p>The Netherlands Railway&mdash;or, to be correct, the Corporation
that branded its rolling-stock Z.A.R.S.M. (Zuid Afrikaansche
Republiek Spoorweg Maatschappij) thoughtfully fenced its permanent
way with blue gum posts. There are none left along the line now.
What few the invading army passed by on its way to Pretoria have
been carefully culled by the subsequent patrols that rode between
the little entrenched stations seeking dynamite cartridges. There
were many posts on the farms. That was how you were able to judge
whether a farm was fairly prosperous or not. You did not look for
fat cattle or good crops. You sought wooden fence-posts. And when
you beheld them you knew that the late occupant of the farm had
been a member of the Volksraad, or a holder of Government
concessions, or a Landrost. No one but a wealthy man can afford to
fence with wooden posts in South Africa. And they were truly a
Godsend to Tommy Atkins and Tommy Cornstalk. If, towards evening,
when there seemed to be a prospect of getting into quarters for the
night before very long, a Brigade should happen to encounter a line
of wire fencing with wooden posts, such event was hailed with the
utmost joy and gratitude. Lines of men spread along it on either
side of the direction of the march, and, by the time that the last
waggon had rattled through the opening made by the wire-cutters,
there was no fence remaining for a mile or two to left and right.
Should the march not come to an end so soon as expected, men often
carried heavy posts on their shoulders or across their wallets, for
hours and miles. Any labour was worth undertaking for a fire at
night.</p>

<p>A six-pound bully-beef tin is an excellent and providential
article of veldt culinary ware. You pick it up empty at daylight in
the lines, and fasten it to the end of your carbine-bucket, where,
during the day, it plays a picturesque and not unmusical part. At
nightfall, after you are fed, you fill it with water and boil the
fat and dust out of it on your fire, and you possess an invaluable
utensil. You may carry water in it, or you may draw your tea and
coffee in it, or you may boil down your scraggy beef, or make a
curry, or a rice pudding, or the satisfying and sustaining
mealie-pap. At a pinch, you may use its flat side as a
writing-desk.</p>

<p>The cavalry mess-tin is a poor thing&mdash;a simple frying-pan
of shallow make, designed rather to hang easily from the saddle
than to possess any intrinsic merit as a cooking-pot&mdash;but the
infantry tin, that is indeed a friend of man. It does not carry
well on horseback. It is built to sit upon the rolled blanket which
the foot soldier bears in the 'small' of his overladen back; but of
all useful, convenient, adaptable, blessed contrivances it is
surely a prince among pots. About seven inches long and four wide,
it is oval on the one side and flat upon the other. It is a little
deeper than wide. There is a handle to the body by which you may
lift it on or off the fire. Its lid is a frying-pan whose handle
folds within, and a tin plate is fitted ingeniously into the top of
the pot. You may boil your mealies and fry your steak at the same
time, and when you have eaten the former to the last vestige, you
may draw your coffee in it. Truly, it comes next to the cavalry
cloak as a good and sensible piece of equipment. No kit, as an
advertisement would say, is complete without one.</p>

<p>Night comes down over the great camp&mdash;sudden, black, cold.
The little fires twinkle through the legs of horses. Over in the
Artillery lines a great group of overcoats stands out against a
brighter blaze. The gunners are burning a Boer waggon and giving a
concert. Queer barrack-room ballads&mdash;just as Kipling renders
them, only more so&mdash;are roared out into the night.</p>

<p class="poem">Git up, you ord'ly man!<br>
Git up, you ord'ly man!<br>
Carn't you 'ear the ord'ly sargint call-in'?<br>
Git up an' clean th' room,<br>
Or the clink'll be y'r doom&mdash;<br>
Y'll be up before old Squidgy in the morn-in'.</p>

<p>Their songs have many verses, and many quaint features, but they
are not the kind of songs which would be popular at tea-meetings.
There is a gracefully graceless ribaldry about the majority of them
that keeps them also from ever getting written.</p>

<p>There was a mess of four in that bivouac&mdash;and in many other
bivouacs of that march to Pretoria. Sometimes it shared two
biscuits and a little raw beef, sometimes it fared sumptuously on
the best that the land had to give. To-night heaven had sent a
Canadian. He had ridden jauntily into the lines, inquiring for his
'outfit'&mdash;which was the Second Canadian M.I. No one knew where
the Canadian M.I. might be. The night was black as ink, and seemed
to threaten rain.</p>

<p>"Say," said the 'Yank,' "kin I throw down with you boys, then?
Guess you are the Australians, ain't <i>that so</i>? Waal, if I carn't
find any more Canadians, I reckon th' Australians comes pretty
close <i>up</i>. Y' don't mind if I throw down in this hyar <i>lo</i>-cation, do
yew now? Guess I kin contri<i>bute</i> my share to the festive board."</p>

<p>We knew not the verb 'to throw down'&mdash;but, as two fowls
hung to one side of his queer saddle and a leg of mutton to the
other, we intimated that he might, if he chose, do as he
desired.</p>

<p>So he 'threw down'&mdash;that is to say, he untied the various
knots of buffalo-hide and string which kept the saddle in its
place, picketed the remarkably fresh pony in the lines, and
disposed of his blanket and coat amongst our kits. And we assisted
in the cooking of the poultry and the mutton, as well as in the
eating thereof, and they were very good, and after they were all
gone except the bones and the feathers, we were able to supply him
with some real tobacco to chew. You cannot chew Boer tobacco.</p>

<p>So, whilst the thin smoke of our pipes lost itself amongst the
stars, and the little flickering flame at the end of the fence-post
lit up bearded and dirty, but no longer hungry faces, an hour or
two passed pleasantly enough in yarns, and lies, and lazy
anecdotes. One spoke of cane growing on the Northern River, and
waxed enthusiastic over the great forests, and the red cedar, and
the soil. Another became eloquent as to lucerne on the Hunter.
Another lied of little fish that came out of artesian bores where
he lived. Another, who was an Irishman and a policeman, recounted
some few of his adventures and misadventures whilst in charge of a
lunatic on the Macleay.</p>

<p>The Canadian chewed and spat royally into the fire until it was
in danger of extinguishment, and told us of his doings of the
day.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll jes' tell yew boys what one of those something
French's Scouts had the darned hide to do, or raither to try to do,
during the day. I reckon he had a pretty <i>con</i>-siderable section of
real, slap-up cheek, too.</p>

<p>"Y' see, two of the boys, <i>and</i> yours truly, we slipped away from
th' 'outfit' t' see what we could pick up sorter permiscuous like.
We moosied along over the darned veldt until we came to a Kaffir
kral&mdash;a pretty good <i>kind</i> of kral, too&mdash;mud cabin an'
bamboo fixin's. Must'er b'longed to pretty w'althy col'd gent, I
guess. And we sees a lot of ponies browsin' roun' in th' prairie.
After a deal of trouble, we corralled the mustangs in one of them
stone corrals, an' calc'lated to fix ourselves with <i>re</i>-mounts and a
spare hoss or two to lead along to the 'outfit'. So we sot down to
make a pot of tea, before catching the ponies an' gettin'
along.</p>

<p>"Bymbye, up comes a leftenint of French's Scouts, with a yaller
boy ridin' behind him, a-leadin' his pack-horse. An' he sees our
<i>re</i>-mounts. So, without so much as having the <i>po</i>-liteness to ask for
one, he sails in an' commences to help himself to the pick of our
pri<i>vate</i> stud. We watched him select his fancy&mdash;an' he took a
deal of care in pickin' it out. One o' th' boys <i>re</i>-marks to him:
'Say, mister, what are y' calc'latin' to do with that there pony y'
got roped up thar?' He allowed he was goin' t' have it. 'Oh, no,'
my friend sez, quiet like; 'oh, no, y'r not&mdash;they jes' about
b'long to me 'n my friends here.' 'My deah fellow,' sez French's
Scout, 'they do not. They b'long to the Kaffirs, and I'm goin' ter
requisition this one. I'm an off'cer,' he sez; 'I hold Her
Majesty's commission.' 'Waal,' sez Charley, 'y' might hold th'
angel Gabriel's <i>co</i>-mission, an' then agin', y' mightn't,' he sez;
'but I guess y' jes' goin' t' leave that darned hoss whar he is.
We've taken the trouble to run them in,' he sez, 'and we jes' about
<i>con</i>-clude that they are our private prop'ty. An' what's more,' he
sez, 'I guess y'r lookin' f'r trouble,' he sez, 'an' I kin tell <i>yew</i>
y've come right har whar you kin git it!' he sez.</p>

<p>"An' at last we <i>con</i>-vinced him that our title was O.K., an' he
left in a dam hurry to see the provo'-marshal about it.</p>

<p>"But this here's what stuck in my neck&mdash;his own hoss was
good, an' fresh, an' fit for anything, but he wanted to take one of
our <i>re</i>-mounts to give to his nigger&mdash;yes, gentlemen, to his
darned useless nigger! If his own hoss had bin knocked up, we'd bin
happy to sell him one, supposin' he'd asked f'r it civil and nice,
but he ackshally&mdash;true's I'm sittin' right har&mdash;he wanted
to give one of our hosses to his darned Jim Crow <i>coon!</i> We couldn't
'low that, so we hunted him an' his darned son of a sweep
away."</p>

<p>As you make your bed so you must lie upon it. If you wake up in
the night with an impression of lying across a small kopje it is
quite your own fault. You should have kicked down the tussocks and
removed the loose stones before you spread out the waterproof
sheet.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of art required in the making of a
comfortable bed if your only material consists of a mackintosh
sheet, one brown blanket and an overcoat. On these frosty nights
you have to get the maximum of warmth out of the minimum of
material. You pull the saddle round so that its seat faces the
direction of the wind, and stand it up on end so that the sideflaps
make a small shelter for your head. Inside the saddle you make your
pillow out of haversack, towel, helmet&mdash;anything available
that may serve your needs best. To undress, you remove your spurs
and boots, and unwind the puttees from your legs. If you wrap your
feet up in your puttees they will keep them warm, but the best plan
is to leave your boots on, and pull a pair of woollen socks over
them&mdash;provided, of course, that you possess the socks. You lie
down upon the waterproof sheet, pull the blanket up to your ears,
and spread out the coat sideways over it. Then you tuck blanket and
coat round your feet and under your sides, pull the thrice-blessed
'Balaclava' over your ears, light your pipe, and thank heaven
fervently for the many luxuries it is your privilege to enjoy.</p>

<p>It is a queer life this. No one at home can know it exactly as
it is. No one out here can quite describe it. It is rough, it is
hard and it is dangerous, but it is intensely interesting and
exciting. The glorious healthiness of it is its perfect charm.
There are fever, and dysentery, and pneumonia&mdash;but, provided
that you can keep clear of these, you will almost fatten on it.
There is also, of course, considerable danger of what a certain
member of the much-quoted quoted Canadians termed 'darned
leadpoisoning'&mdash;meaning thereby, the chance of going under to
a bullet&mdash;but that is the element which supplies the
excitement, and, as a matter of fact, is far less a real danger
than the bad water and insanitary surroundings.</p>

<p>War may be immoral, and deplorable, and barbarous, but from the
point of view of the combatant (<i>not</i> the women and children) there
are many worse phases of existence. It is a big sport, a gamble
with fate&mdash;and, as such, while the human composition remains
human, it will never cease to exercise a certain fascination and
attractiveness to man.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII - THE BATTLE</h2>

<p>The long rocky ridges overlooking the road down which the Boer
convoy disappeared at dusk last evening is a bleak, windswept,
unhappy place at dawn. It has been an unhappy place all through the
long darkness&mdash;a lonely, inhospitable, barren perch upon which
lost souls might roost and bemoan their fates in the small hours
and be in keeping with their surroundings, but where flesh and
blood feels that it is distinctly a trial of patience and endurance
to spend eight freezing hours.</p>

<p>All night the bitter wind has whined and whistled through the
rocks, moaning sadly in the long dry grass and about the scanty
bushes, thrusting its icy hand into one's very body through cloak,
and tunic, and jumper, and woollen shirt. To stand upon the summit
keeping watch had been as though one walked naked along the weather
side of a ship's deck in Southern seas. The clear brightness of the
stars blazing and twinkling in a cloudless sky overhead has
accentuated the keen chill of existence on this iceberg, glacier,
snowfield&mdash;anything but good, dry, warm, hospitable earth.</p>

<p>At dusk, our rifles had flamed long-range volleys into the
valley, and we had prayed for just one little field-gun, for just
one handy Maxim to reach the crawling oxen, that slowly and
haltingly, but bravely and surely, dragged the last of the Boers'
waggons into safety and escape behind the little rise that covered
their crossing to the river. We had been too few to make the sudden
dash that would have given them to us, too far ahead of the slow
batteries that might have wrecked and splintered wheels and
disselbooms and covers, and mowed down the patient oxen where they
toiled laboriously to shelter. One Maxim might have done it. One
pom-pom would have captured them at five thousand yards, but our
little carbines could not check the slow escape at half that
distance.</p>

<p>Once, as the last waggon came slowly into the field of fire, it
had halted and remained. Through glasses, the spit of the hailing
nickel had made on the ground about it a little dust squall. Two
yoke of oxen fell before it, and the cart seemed to be over. Yet
brave men had come through the storm of death leading slow oxen,
and had gallantly drawn the waggon the hundred yards that had to be
crossed before it disappeared from out straining eyesight in the
fast gathering gloom. Brave, dauntless, determined men
those&mdash;whether sjambok-threatened Kaffirs or plucky
Boers&mdash;and one could hardly hold back a cheer even, as the
almost abandoned team crawled into safety round the shoulder of the
tiny hillock.</p>

<p>The Boer may be an unenlightened, slothful 'waster'. He may not
have too well-defined notions as to treachery and guile. He may
play the white flag trick&mdash;but he is no coward. Black-hearted
Ben Viljoen had led a team of horses to save a pom-pom on the
Tugela, alone and single-handed, and had saved it, and been
credited with his brave deed; but that Boer or Kaffir driver who
brought the slow bullocks into the rain of bullets in the cold dusk
of that winter evening by the Gatsrand did something which, had it
been a gun and he an Englishman, would have won for him the V.C.
and a justly and well earned fame. In point of merit it was a deed
no whit behind the saving of the guns of 'Q' Battery at Sanna's
Post. Heaven alone knows now what the cart contained. Had it been
bar-gold instead of possible mealies, or shells, or furniture, its
salvation from us could not have been more worthy of respect, or
more admirable and gallant than it was.</p>

<p>Here, at daylight, as the cold sky paled and yellowed and flamed
into the crimson promise of a glorious day, we sat among the rocks
and shivered. The ridge we had occupied through the night sloped,
not very steeply, up from the valley we had been ascending all
yesterday afternoon, but dropped in a sudden steepness below us
into as fair a vale as ever man had gazed upon.</p>

<p>A tree-lined river meandered down a flat. White farms dotted its
banks, and little plots of 'cultivation'. Beyond it stretched a
grassy plain to the low, rocky foothills of a line of purple ranges
over which towered one great berg higher than its fellows. All
about the horizon weird spidery structures with tall smoke stacks
stood out black and sharply cut against the fresh sky. Over all
brooded the calm of early morning&mdash;the quiet peacefulness of a
world not yet awake.</p>

<p>It was the promised land, the lost Eldorado of so many months
which had been the ultimate cause of our coming from all the
quarters of the globe&mdash;the rich, blood-bought gold-reef,
which, argue as we may concerning the enlightenment we distribute
with bullet and lyddite, or the visions of Dutch confederation
which Paul Kruger and Steyn, his dupe, might have dreamed, was, and
is, the great final <i>casus belli</i> of this bloody struggle between
Dutch and English for supremacy in South Africa.</p>

<p>One could not gaze out over the quiet valley and beyond the dim
ridges to where the great mine buildings stood&mdash;some of them
still sending up thin columns of black smoke into the clear air,
and still seeming to be worked&mdash;without feeling that here, at
last, was the thing we had been marching, and starving, and getting
fever, and dying for all these months past; that here, indeed, was
the great reward of toil, and danger, and sickness, and blood that
had been spilt as water over half a year and more. This was the
thing that was to pay for Magersfontein, and Colenso, and
Stormberg, and the Tugela&mdash;for the sufferings of the women and
little children of Ladysmith, and Kimberley, and Mafeking. Here it
was&mdash;a long system of a particular kind of dirt, occurring in
a peculiar geological fashion and containing a yellow metal. This
was the prize, the great bone of contention which the big dog was
taking from the little one&mdash;and taking it simply because he
could not avoid doing so.</p>

<p>O land of gold and greed, mysterious lying and open cheating,
how much have you to answer for! The burned homes, the
bullet-pocked walls, the new graves, the pestilential hospitals,
the brave lives&mdash;how great and strong for good you will need
to become ere you pay for all these! Treasure, and Life, and Love.
These are the items of your vast indebtedness, and the last not the
least. Do you think, Golden Rand, that you will ever liquidate your
liabilities?</p>

<p>Over there, vaguely beyond the ranges, lies Johannesburg.
Somewhere not very far across the veldt the ill-starred Jameson
brought his idiotic raid to an inglorious finish. What a
finish&mdash;we have not come to it yet.</p>

<p>The sun rises out of the shoulder of the great berg. There are
no Boers in all the valley. Everything is still and tranquil, as it
always should be in this vale of peace. From the farmhouses on the
river bends the blue smoke curls up into the morning. Cocks crow
distantly below our feet. The road that leads behind the little
hillock stretches clear and white from out the narrow pass on our
left hand. There is no sign or trace of the convoy that trekked
along it yesternight, save a couple of black specks very far away
that may be dead oxen.</p>

<p>They have all gone apparently&mdash;gone again as always. We
march, and march, and march day after day, week after week, and we
never come to handgrips with our wily foe. Will they ever stand and
fight us? Will they ever give us the chance we want so badly of
bringing the war to an end in one grand death-grip? Are we always
to trek, trek, trek till the Day of Judgment, and never catch and
close with them? Will they defend the city?</p>

<p>What a joke it would be to shell Johannesburg! From all accounts
it would be a glorious place to wreck. And then&mdash;the loot.
Think of it, you who own it&mdash;how would it be if we, the
saviours of your dividends, had had to blast your assets with
common shell. Our stars&mdash;but it would have been funny!
Mayfair, Rondebosch, Durban, Delagoa&mdash;how you would have
squirmed as you read. It would well-nigh have been as comfortable
for you in the cold veldt, where you would, at least, have had the
distraction of doing, as to be biting your nails and fuming
impotently over the wires that told of your stores, and banks, and
suburbs under the blighting influence of the Four-point-Sevens.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher. Up on the ridge the wind that blew all
night had stopped the frost, but down in the sheltered shadow of
the hills it covered the grass in great patches like thin snow. The
cold breeze had died away at dawn, and now, though still bitterly
raw to half-starved men, the day was slowly brightening and
mellowing in the golden sunlight.</p>

<p>They were strange figures that huddled amongst the rocks.
Unshaven, dirty, wolfish faces looked grimly out from woollen caps
and mufflers as the tired men sat in their blue-black overcoats,
with the great collars sticking up about their ears, carbines
resting across knees, the thin reek of disreputable pipes tingeing
the clear air.</p>

<p>Last night had been supperless. No one knew where the Brigade
might be, save that it had halted somewhere behind in yesterday's
valley. We could not see back to overlook it because the ridge was
flat on top, and wide ere it fell away. The horses had remained at
the foot with their holders all night. We had had no blankets,
nothing to eat or drink, and there was going to be no breakfast.
The day was bright enough, and the sky blue, and the view
magnificent&mdash;but how may you appreciate a fine day, and an
azure sky, and a glorious prospect when there is nothing in your
inside but a hollow?</p>

<p>A man came up on the ridge who said we were to rejoin the
Brigade and draw more ammunition. Had he mentioned biscuits or
bully-beef he would have been appreciated and popular. As it was,
the message he brought got him disliked. We had emptied our
bandoliers into the convoy last evening, so that the order to
replenish them out of the ammunition-cart hardly augured anything
out of the common.</p>

<p>We gathered up haversacks and water-bottles, and wended our weak
way down the slope to where the poor limp horses and the profane
horse-holders hung their heads and cursed the cold night
respectively.</p>

<p>The Brigade had camped below the ridge. The Fourth were across
the valley, upon the other side of the pass, and Hutton's Mounted
Infantry were tumbling along with their guns from behind. The long
train of transport-waggons toiled up the valley.</p>

<p>When the little packets had been untied, and the slim cartridges
stowed away in the bandoliers, we mounted and rode back to a
farmhouse in the rear, where there was a dam, in order to water the
horses. There was absolutely nothing left at that farm except some
hay, which a foraging Cornstalk had discovered in a
loft&mdash;hundreds of bundles of it. Fowls, pigs,
sheep&mdash;everything&mdash;had been eaten up over night; so we
watered our horses, and strapped two bundles of hay apiece to the
rear of the saddles, and rode back to the Brigade, which was
forming up to march.</p>

<p>Down through the narrow road between the hills the dingy column
rolled heavily in the dust. Sweating engineers threw gravel and
rocks into the ruts and ditches so that the jolting guns might pass
by. Dragoons, Hussars, Cornstalks, Canadians chaffed, and spat, and
smoked by the roadside. The cloud of fine white dust rose high into
the air. If there were any Boers watching from the Berg they would
know, without doubt, that the khakis were coming.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steep hills some sort of order evolved itself
from chaos. Batteries pieced themselves together again. Harassed
mules drew bumping Scotch carts to their rightful regiments.
Troops, and squadrons, and regiments and brigades reformed.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade drew away to the left, and rode to find a
crossing-place higher up the river. We went on down the road, past
the hillock where the dead trek-oxen lay, and a little pool of
dried blood had congealed by the side of the track&mdash;past a
white house, and a garden, and a store on to a short wooden bridge
that led across the little stream, and where the column narrowed
into 'files' and crossed more slowly, the scouts spreading out and
galloping over the plains beyond the farther bank.</p>

<p>The trees along the river were beautiful weeping willows, shady
elms and great Cape-mulberries. Then the flat extended before
us&mdash;waving grass that shone as a wheat-field in the morning
sunlight&mdash;and stretched away to a low line of rocky kopjes
immediately in front, and a short two miles away, sweeping round
the left extremity of the tiny range and on up into low rolling
ridges. Beyond the line of rocks towards which we moved there was
another and a higher series, separated from the first by a gently
rising plain. Beyond them, again, rose taller hills, and from their
midst the great blue Berg dominated all, and seemed to frown upon
us as we came riding over the plain.</p>

<p>The quiet glory of a divine day rested over everything. Doves
cooed musically in the river timber, one red-brick house to the
left nestled in a bend. Six tall poplars grew before it, bare and
leafless now. The inevitable white flag flew from a chimney.</p>

<p>As we left the bridge and the river we spread out across the
plain in long lines twenty yards apart. Each man was fifty from his
right and left hand neighbour. Something was in the wind, but no
one knew what. Perhaps Johnny French had known, and that was why we
extended so rapidly to the most open of open order as we came on to
the wide plain.</p>

<p>Until the guns open you never know that you are going into
battle. So many times were the usual precautions against surprise
taken by the leaders, and so many times did emptiness of event
characterise the day's operations, that we had begun to be
sceptical as to whether 'opening out' really meant anything or
not&mdash;whether all preparation for possible combat were not,
after all, a mere matter of form. There were, of course, signs and
omens that might point to an engagement, as, for instance, when the
'Pick-me-ups' (ambulance waggons) followed close up to the firing
line. But, as a rule, it was never safe to prophesy an action until
the first Boer shell came howling overhead. Brer' Boer was so very
much an adept at lyin' low an' sayin' nuffin' until the time came
when he considered he might say it with most effect, that it
frequently came about that you were in the midst of a hot fire
although, half an hour before, you would have readily betted
against any possibility of such an eventuality. And, just as
frequently, after you had been cautiously 'feeling' some 'dirty'
country for half an afternoon you would find that he was not
there.</p>

<p>You are half across the plain now&mdash;riding loosely and
carelessly through the rich grass, the hungry horses reaching
greedily for a mouthful of it every now and then. The black dots of
scouts have reached and passed the first line of rocks. They are in
the little strip of open country between that ridge and the
next.</p>

<p>Ping-pong!</p>

<p>"Hullo! what's that?" you ask yourself aloud, at the same time
gathering up the loose reins and pulling your horse together. All
eyes are straining after the specks that move across the open, but,
as you ride forward, the ridge in front just hides them.</p>

<p>Ping-pong! ping-pong! ping, ping, ping-pong! pong,
pong&mdash;p-r-r-r-r-r-mp!&mdash;pingpong! ping-pong! It is the
overture. A running, ripping, far away crashing of rifle-fire comes
from the second ridges. You cannot see the scouts, but you know how
they are racing. They are getting it 'pretty hot,' and somehow it
seems to you rather funny.</p>

<p>Ah! Now it is our turn.</p>

<p>Far away, on the left shoulder of the great Berg, a little white
cloud, wonderfully clear and distinct, has risen into the blue sky.
You have seen it before&mdash;that beautiful, white, woolly
cloud.</p>

<p>For a long time nothing seems to come of it. Five, ten, fifteen
seconds slip by and the day is just as still, and calm, and
beautiful as before. Twenty seconds&mdash;and a deep, solemn,
reverberating 'boom-m' trembles through the clear air.</p>

<p>"It's close now. Is the dam thing coming my way?"</p>

<p>The great Creusot shell suddenly whistles and howls high
overhead, and, almost as soon as you have heard it in the air, it
bursts with a thunderous, sudden 'bang!' that cuts short its
devilish song, throwing up a great column of dust and dirt and
stones behind you, and seeming to blow a man and a horse who are
near it into a thousand pieces. Almost before the dust and blue
smoke and smell of powder have drifted away you see that man
pulling his astonished charger on to its feet again! The long lines
of horse-men move slowly over the plain.</p>

<p>It is the first note of an infernal symphony which is to be
played all day.</p>

<p>Again the solemn 'boom-m'&mdash;but this time from another
place, and with no white cloud. Again the shrieking flutter in the
sky, and again the crashing burst and flying stones&mdash;away to
your left.</p>

<p>Still the steady lines move forward.</p>

<p>From the Berg the white tuft of smoke once more drifts up,
slowly and peacefully, into the blueness. This time you count the
seconds carefully. Between 'nineteen' and 'twenty' the great gun
booms out its note to you.</p>

<p>There are no sound symbols to express that rushing, howling,
whining whir-r-r, as the ninety-six pounds of destructiveness
cleave their rapid, invisible way through the air&mdash;but it is a
sound which you will never confuse with any other in your life.</p>

<p>The abrupt explosion again cuts it short. This one bursts just
short of the leading line. You rapidly reckon up the range. Twenty
seconds divided by five gives four. Roughly, you are four miles
away from the black-powder Creusot. It is somewhere about seven
thousand yards.</p>

<p>Good shooting! They have put in one just too far and another
just too short. The next ought to do something.</p>

<p>Two more hurtling shots from the invisible Long Toms dig
harmless holes in the veldt to left and right.</p>

<p>The whole plain is full of horsemen now. They come
on&mdash;quietly, ordered, slow&mdash;towards the rocks. It is the
wonder of discipline. Nobody enjoys being shelled. Every one would
rather be somewhere else. It is no 'picnic' to behold sudden death
arriving by the hundredweight. Hardest of all is it to walk your
nervous horse, and to keep the intervals and 'dressing' of the open
ranks so that you do not bunch. But just because that cool
Colonel&mdash;who is as a gentle old lady in camp&mdash;gives no
order and makes no sign you ride forward, a better man than in all
your life before, because you have learned your lesson of blind
obedience, even unto Death.</p>

<p>Some squadrons edge over to the open ground on the left that
passes by the end of the ridge. We are evidently going to occupy
those rocks.</p>

<p>The Berg puffs its smoke into the sky once again. Again the long
waiting. Again the weird scream&mdash;and then&mdash;b-r-rump!
bang!&mdash;the shell plumps right into the midst of the moving
swarm of horsemen, a hundred yards to your right front and close
beside a horse. Through the drifting dust and dull smoke you see
him lifted off his legs backwards and thrown to the ground across
his rider. You notice that a hind leg kicks feebly&mdash;once,
twice&mdash;and is still. The man's head and shoulders are towards
you. His left hand neighbour digs in the spurs, gallops suddenly to
where the lifeless heap of man and horse lies in the grass beside a
great new hole, and dismounts and bends over the stricken pair.</p>

<p>Suddenly his hand goes up, and he seems to have called, for
another man races to the spot. Together they drag, and pull, and
shove&mdash;and, ere you are past, one of them is supporting a
reeling, drunken, limp-legged figure who is, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, yet
alive&mdash;though he himself does not seem quite certain of the
fact. He staggers back on foot, his comrades' arms about his
shoulders, and sits down on the ground with his dazed head in his
hands.</p>

<p>The fear of God is in your heart, but still you ride slowly
forward.</p>

<p>From somewhere in the second line of rocks a new note reaches
you. It is closer and louder, and so close that you are able to see
the faint vapour of each discharge slowly curling above the bushes.
Almost as soon as the sound of it, comes another rending 'bang' in
the air above, and a beautiful cloudlet forms itself out of nothing
and sends a sudden rush of screeching shrapnel bullets tearing up
the dust&mdash;just where no one happens to be.</p>

<p>The three great guns in the background are dropping their
ponderous missiles all about the flat now. The air is full of their
rushing flight. One of them has discovered a Horse Battery as it
comes out from the river across the flat behind us. It is galloping
'for all it is worth,' and the great shells drop closer and closer
each time, seeming to cover it with dust, but not to check it.</p>

<p>That Battery Commander knows what he is about. The Red-Books
teach him to bring his guns out in a clump, affording thereby an
excellent target for Long Tom, instead of sneaking them one by one
into position. But he zig-zags this way and that, to left and
right, across the plain, dodging, as it were, the range of the big
fellows in the Berg.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i>&mdash;sudden, quick&mdash;in the rank ahead of you, right
at a horse's head!</p>

<p>In the flash and roar of the bursting shell, you see the
stricken man throw out his arms. As the horse rears backward he
comes to the ground clear of him, and lies spread-eagled with limbs
outstretched, and blackened, bleeding face staring dumbly into the
smiling heavens.</p>

<p>God!&mdash;it was sudden. His brother is beside him, lifting a
white, horror-stricken face, as he holds the battered head upon his
knees.</p>

<p>"Come on, you fellows; never mind that man," cries the
troop-leader, trotting back to where you pause like a crowd at a
street accident. You ride slowly past the dead man. It makes you
feel bad inside, but wild to rush the fifteen-pounder on the second
ridge which did the work.</p>

<p>Now, from its left, comes a sound you had been expecting.
Pom-pom-pom-pompom-pom-pom-pom&mdash;like an even succession of
heavy strokes upon a drum. Horridly screaming past, the little
devils go ripping through the lines of horsemen, knocking the dust
up all about, but doing no
damage&mdash;crack-crack-crack-crackcrack-crack-crack-crack!</p>

<p>As the ridge draws closer the din becomes terrific. The great
cannon by the Berg boom out their solemn notes unceasingly, and
their terrible missiles keep on dropping all about the plain,
throwing up huge red spouts of dust and dirt like miniature
volcanoes in eruption. From a closer range five or six lighter
pieces of artillery shell the ground energetically to our left, as
the greater part of the troops on the plain edge that way. There is
a continual screaming, rushing noise that fills all the sky. The
day shakes and trembles with the Titanic crashing sounds. All the
devils of hell are loose about the world.</p>

<p>As we halt below the ridge the Berg sends a messenger to the
left extremity of the rocks. It lands where they join the alluvial.
Such heaps of flying stones and clods of earth spin up from where
it strikes as to make you feel that the kopje is in danger of
falling down.</p>

<p>The pom-pom in front is turning its attention to the right now,
where a regiment of Canadians are stretching at a gallop to seize
the flank of the ridge we occupy. The fifteen-pounder sends a
message to us to quit, but it flies overhead low down and bursts
behind the horses. This little gun means to give some trouble.</p>

<p>Dismounted, with carbines&mdash;we are crouching in the rocks
and grass, spread out all along the ridge. The plain stretches
grassy and fair before us to where that horrid gun works just
beyond our reach. Its almost invisible haze shows faintly among the
bushes. Another shell comes and bursts in the air lower
down&mdash;a hundred yards too short&mdash;and tears the ground
with shrapnel. We seem to be in for a warm time of it if we stay
here. Another shot, and they will have our range accurately, and
will pepper us.</p>

<p>But suddenly the quick, loud crack of cordite seems to burst in
our very ears. Something roars overhead. A little tuft of smoke
lifts above the opposite ridge some way beyond the Boer gun. Our
own batteries are coming into action behind. We are between two
fires. Long Tom howls over us at the battery, the battery spits at
the fifteen-pounder within its reach. They lose no time.</p>

<p>Our <i>vis-à-vis</i> bursts a shell in the rocks, and a flying stone
breaks a man's arm. Quickly again comes the smack of the
cordite&mdash;and again, and again, in rapid succession.</p>

<p>There is a rushing wind above our heads, a diminishing roar as
they cross the flat, and the three shells seem to land right on the
Boer gun. He does not speak any more&mdash;at least, not from that
position.</p>

<p>Heavens above! but it is good to hear the bark of our own little
guns. They are little and light, but there are none in all the
world so well served as those of the R.H.A. They snap and snarl at
the great baying Long Tom just as a terrier baits a mastiff, and
they work in under his far-reaching fire, and discomfort his
gunners with shrapnel in the most impudent way conceivable.</p>

<p>The battery behind continues to shell the ridge over our heads
for a little time longer. They search it with 'shrapnel,' and knock
the rocks about with 'common,' and generally seem to inflict
discomfort on its occupants. We seem to be the focus of all the
sounds of war.</p>

<p>The battery draws all the fire from Long Tom. The shells seem to
burst between the guns. They set fire to the grass. The battery
limbers-up, and presently opens for a new place. A squadron of
mounted infantry comes out of the river and rides back and forward
to draw Long Tom's attention from the battery as it changes
ground.</p>

<p>Great columns of smoke veil the hills behind as the fires
amongst the grass spread rapidly, leaving black patches upon the
veldt.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII - THE BATTLE
(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>

<p>All the fight is upon our left hand now. The great cannon of the
Berg send their plunging missiles into the soft veldt soil where no
one is. They seem to be making gravel-pits.</p>

<p>Assuredly, we are shelved for the day in these rocks. The
Brigades are over there, trying to edge round the enemy's right
flank; but they are getting a warm reception. Since the
fifteen-pounder has become silent our end of the ridge has remained
unmolested.</p>

<p>Not so on the right. Ther is a rolling crash of rifle-fire, and
there had been the horrid barking of the Boer pom-pom, half a mile
from us. The Canadians are being wiped off the face of the kopje,
apparently.</p>

<p>But only 'apparently'. In reality, the 'boys' are skilfully
'verneuking' those past masters of 'verneukery'&mdash;the
Johannesburg Police. We did not hear of it until several nights
afterward, but it was very neat.</p>

<p>Opposite the end of the ridge where the Canadians were a large
commando of Boers occupied a closer-sweeping spur of
'Fifteen-pounder Ridge,' well within rifle range. For an hour or
more both sides had steadily exchanged shots. The Boers had brought
up a pom-pom, and for a time, until silenced by a section of a
Horse Battery which had crept up unseen from the river, had worried
the Canadians over-much. It was evident that the Boers greatly
coveted the position of the latter, and meant to have it if such
were possible.</p>

<p>Then the O.C. Canadians did a clever thing. Suddenly calling
upon his men to retire, and causing them to mount their horses
behind the kopje&mdash;the while they cursed him fervently for a
coward below their breaths&mdash;he galloped his regiment along the
rear of the ridge, so that they passed between a gap in it and a
smaller elevation behind, and must have seemed to the Boers to be
in full and hurried retreat. Once past the gap, he wheeled them
quickly behind the little isolated hill that faced it, and waited
there ten minutes. A single remaining subaltern watched with his
field-glasses from the rocks whence they had come.</p>

<p>Five, six, seven, ten minutes&mdash;the Boers kept up a hailing
fire upon the ridge, to which there was no reply. They had seen the
Canadians stand up to retire, and then ride past the gap, and by
now must have felt that the desired position was theirs for the
taking. So out they came into the open&mdash;a wildly galloping mob
of several hundred horsemen. From behind a boulder the sub. waved
his pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>Now was the chance of the 'darned ol' Colonel'. Back they went
at a gallop to the kopje. The lieutenant upon its top was
signalling frantically from his rock. The racing Boers were half
across the open.</p>

<p>Up through the rocks swarmed the eager regiment. Below the crest
they halted, and, following the example of their commander and his
officers, stole forward cautiously on hands and knees to the edge
that overlooked the plain. Great boulders, and grass, and bushes
shielded them from sight. They spread about the top, and laid their
cartridges out in convenient heaps, and adjusted sights and
elbow-rests. They were to do the thing in style this time.</p>

<p>On and on swept the excited Boers. Oh! but it must have been
grand to see the Zarps&mdash;the tricky, slim, patrol-getting
Zarps, to whom we all owed so much that we wished to
repay&mdash;riding witlessly into Gehenna. No one fired a shot at
them&mdash;the Colonel was to judge how close they should come.
Nothing was to be done but keep on fixing the sights as the range
altered and decreased. It would be a little Bunker's Hill.</p>

<p>At five hundred yards the noise of the thundering hoofs was
plain and loud. At four, they were racing for who should be first
into the coveted position whence might be raked the whole ridge. It
must have been exciting for the Canadians.</p>

<p>On&mdash;on&mdash;on to three hundred. A fine man on a grey pony
led the van, his great beard flowing back against his chest. Now
and then he waved his rifle overhead and yelled. It was the Dutch
equivalent to a cavalry charge.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards away and they still galloped. The murderous
blue barrels of the Lee-Metfords poked out amongst the rocks. Keen
eyes were glancing along the steady barrels. Strong hands held
men's lives in the twitching of dirty forefingers.</p>

<p>A rifle cracked from the middle of the kopje, and the
black-bearded leader left his saddle with startling sudden
limpness, and was merely a bleeding heap of clothing in the
grass.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;what a hell it must have been amongst the Boers; such
a hell as they had so often loosed on us, such a hell as must have
been at Magersfontein, and amongst the guns at Colenso. For all its
length the kopje cracked out smokeless, flameless death. Half a
dozen saddles emptied themselves, and as many horses kicked,
crippled, in the grass.</p>

<p>On they came still, for twenty yards or so, and many more fell
ere they had all turned and were racing back for their lives,
leaving a wake of dead and wounded behind them as they fled. Five,
six, seven, eight hundred yards, and the little spirts of dust
still splashed between the reeling horses. A thousand&mdash;and two
rounds of shrapnel caught them up and hastened their scurry into
the rocks and bushes. Back from the shelter of the bushes came a
patter of bullets amongst the Canadians.</p>

<p>The two British guns behind plentifully scattered favours
amongst the rocks whither the discomfited Boers had betaken
themselves, and presently their fire died away. Forty of them were
killed and wounded and made prisoners. Truly, the 'slim' Zarp had
met a 'slimmer' than himself!</p>

<p>Without pause the great guns had boomed all through the
forenoon, and at mid-day the air still trembled with their
vibration. We knew nothing of what was going on elsewhere.</p>

<p>A shining, dancing shimmer of mirage hid the veldt to the left.
A great voice came from the placid lake, and where the Creusot
shells dropped into its glittering bosom dust and gravel splashed
up instead of water. Our own guns were barking from the mirage, but
although they may have done good work in silencing the cannon of
smaller calibre which were shelling from a closer range they could
not approach Long Tom. It was cruelly galling to have to receive
all his remarks, without having any chance of joining in the
argument.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the work of the Royal Horse Artillery, as always,
was the most excellent thing about the day's operations. Often and
often whole batteries sneaked in under the long range of the big
fellow&mdash;zig-zagging to and fro, literally dodging the heavy
projectiles he pelted at them&mdash;and burst their little shrapnel
in the air above, so that the Dutch gunners found it all too hot
about the breeches, and more expedient for the time being to rest
under cover at a distance. But whilst one was temporarily out of
action, the others would concentrate their fire, and by sheer
weight of metal compel the withdrawal of the plucky twelve-pounders
and their intrepid gunners.</p>

<p>And here it may not be amiss to remark, that of all branches of
the Imperial army none struck the amateur soldier as being so
worthy of praise and appreciation as the Royal Artillery. On the
whole, the 'regulars' were a disappointment. It seemed to most of
us that the army lacked in every essential that was to be effective
in such wars as the present, save one or two. It was
brave&mdash;that went without saying and as a matter of course. It
was well drilled&mdash;but what did all its training count for
here; or what will it count for in the future? It had found 'Brown
Bess' very useful in the past; it had done much with the
muzzle-loading rifle. Earlier still, it had distinguished itself
with spears and bows and arrows. It had used swords with much
effect in the days when ranges were numbered, both for cannon and
small arms, by the lower hundreds, instead of thousands, of yards.
And it clung to the tradition of the smooth-bore and the sabre,
even whilst it used the breech-loading gun and the magazine rifle.
Because it had found volleys effective against, say, ten thousand
men who covered a front of five hundred yards and had a depth in
formation of not very many more, it clung to them affectionately in
cases where five hundred men extended over a front of ten thousand
yards, and had no depth at all. And it made many kinds of a fool of
itself on many separate occasions simply by its slavish adherence
to systems that nowadays are effective nowhere but on the
melodramatic stage.</p>

<p>But the gunners&mdash;they were good, good beyond all question
or doubt. They, too, had their ancient drill to hamper their
mobility and movement. They, too, had the traditions that bands
playing into action represent. The heavy harness, the useless kit,
the blundering methods of transport were theirs as much as the
Cavalry's and Infantry's. But they knew how to use their weapons,
and no amount of discouragement ever affected their effectiveness.
To silence a British gun you must kill its gunners; even to
interfere with the carrying out of its work in any degree at all
you must, at the very least, wound half its crew. The Artillery
were brave, cool, self-sacrificing, level-headed, disciplined,
devoted&mdash;altogether admirable. The last word sums them up <i>in
toto</i>&mdash;they were 'admirable'. Only&mdash;their guns might have
been better.</p>

<p>Of the Field Artillery we, of French's Division, were unable to
judge. One had only heard the booming of their distant guns; but,
if they be but one-half so efficient, brave and skilful as their
brethren of the Royal Horse, they must come near to being the
second 'crack' corps of the British army.</p>

<p>Noon passed. There was nothing to eat. The horses had had the
bundles of hay, which they 'wolfed' ravenously, but we had only a
couple of holes in our belts&mdash;a diet which is by no means
sustaining. The guns and pom-poms dinned as loudly as ever, and,
occasionally, there was a faint, fierce crackle of rifle-fire far
on the left. The mirage had faded away by one o'clock.</p>

<p>Two o'clock&mdash;and we lay sleeping in the warm sunlight upon
the ridge. Officers strolled about chatting to one another, and
looking through glasses at the distant bodies of troops manoeuvring
in the haze-enveloped veldt. Below the ridge, the worn horses dozed
dejectedly. We seemed to have become mere spectators in the
'Theatre of War'.</p>

<p>But, at half-past three, there came a diversion. In the rising
plain that lay between our position and the opposite ledge of rocks
was a shallow spruit&mdash;a mere depression. It led out from the
hills, and lost itself in the veldt. The rocks and scrub where the
Boers had had their troublesome fifteen-pounder earlier in the day
were beyond our rifle-range. It was the same series of little hills
from which the Johannesburg Police had made their fatal raid, but,
at our end, was much much further away than where it faced the
Canadians. We knew that we were safe from rifle-fire delivered from
the rocks, but the depression in the veldt had not been reckoned
with.</p>

<p>A lengthy trooper sat smoking on a rock. For the time being he
had ceased to be a trooper with a regimental number. He had become
a general&mdash;and a very 'swagger' general too. From time to time
he removed the pipe from his lips, and made caustic comment on the
British army and the leaders thereof. Six feet two,
straight-backed, broad-shouldered, bronzed and long of
limb&mdash;sitting there in the sunlight, he struck one as a
picture of youthful grace and masculine beauty of form and figure
impossible to match. A stubbly growth of beard clouded his strong
jaw. The dark shadow of the helmet-peak lay across his eyes and
brow in a sharp, black line. His carbine was beside him on the
rock. One felt almost proud that the Western Plains could produce
so perfect a specimen of glowing manhood. Perched up there against
the sky-line, he was a goodly thing to look at. And some Dutch
sharpshooter found him an equally goodly thing to shoot at from the
spruit.</p>

<p>He said&mdash;what he said does not matter. It had no possible
reference to the scenery, or himself, or any other person on earth.
But the way he said it made it mean a great deal.</p>

<p>There was a furrow cut across his shoulders from left to right.
His jacket was ruined, and his back grooved with a scar, which will
only fade as he decomposes finally.</p>

<p>"Damned inconvenient," he remarked as an after-thought. No doubt
it was.</p>

<p>The Mausers rumbled in the spruit&mdash;the Mauser bullets
cracked and splashed about the rocks where we were and whined
plaintively in the air.</p>

<p>It was startling&mdash;but we knew the range of the spruit, and
although the best that we could see was an occasional crouching
figure or a peeping head, and the distance was a good thousand
yards, we set to to make it too warm for them to lie in. They had
themselves similar intentions as to our kopje.</p>

<p>Everybody lay now behind the most convenient rock. From the
whole three squadrons a crackling din of cordite ripped amongst the
stones. The two English squadrons fired precise and admirable
volleys. The Cornstalk one fired as its individual members thought
fit. The so-called 'explosive' bullets cracked like little whips,
as they struck near by where you lay.</p>

<p>It is a weird, blood-chilling sound when you hear it for the
first time&mdash;the whistling of those little deaths in the still
air. Not exactly a whistle is it either&mdash;something between
that and a whir-r, but very business-like and brisk. At first you
think that every second of time will be your last upon earth. A
bullet flicks your ear, and you make up your mind to take the next
one as bravely as may be, and fully expect it to come quickly.
Death&mdash;sudden, and sure, and bloody&mdash;seems inevitable,
and, in your heart of hearts, you are afraid&mdash;terribly,
wofully, loathsomely afraid.</p>

<p>But Death passes overhead, or spits in the dust beside you; and
by-and-bye you become familiar with him, and find out that he is
not such a bad fellow at all&mdash;not nearly so keen on getting
you as you had imagined him to be. And you become a
fatalist&mdash;a mere unthinking fatalist. If you are to 'stop
one,' one will be stopped by your body. If you are to come out
scatheless you will do so. In the meantime, your life will be much
pleasanter if you don't worry over your chances.</p>

<p>This is a kind of courage. You know that there is danger in
those whining voices. You quite realise that the next moment may be
your last; but a little custom causes you to regard it all
philosophically, and, although to most men being under fire is
never a pleasant matter, it becomes an in no wise serious one.</p>

<p>Some there are who have never known what fear is&mdash;but they
are creatures deficient in nervous organisation, who lack a primary
instinct, and who, not knowing what it is to be slavishly afraid,
can never rise to the height of overcoming themselves, and doing
their duty in spite of the most awful trial to which the mind of
man may be subjected whilst he holds his reason.</p>

<p>The cracking bullets continue to smite the rocks viciously. The
air still hums with those that pass by. Far down the line you see,
as you load, two Englishmen carrying away a limp comrade by his
head and heels. No one seems to be 'stopping one' in your
vicinity.</p>

<p>But for the pointed rifles and the noise there is nothing
visible to indicate a fight&mdash;that is to say, nothing that you
might photograph. The flying splashes of dust alone show where the
enemy's bullets are hitting. Each time you fire there is only a
very blue haze in front of your rifle-barrel&mdash;so faint that
you cannot see it before the rifle of the next man to you.</p>

<p>Over the rocks behind come sweating men carrying a Maxim in
their arms. One has the gun itself, another the tripod, others the
grey boxes of belted ammunition. A clean-shaven youth directs
them.</p>

<p>They pass through the firing-line, and go half-way down the
front of the little ridge. Here they set up their pretty toy as
coolly as though they were merely a party of surveyors erecting a
theodolite to run a line. Some one adjusts a belt of
cartridges.</p>

<p>The bullets spit all round them and in between the legs of the
tripod and the feet of the sergeant who is laying the gun. The
languid officer walks up and down behind, holding a pair of
field-glasses, a lighted cigarette between his lips, and issuing
quiet orders in a voice indicative rather of boredom than of
anything else.</p>

<p>Tat-tat-tat-tat!&mdash;all in one breath, but each discharge
distinct and clear, and of a note exactly similar to the one
preceding it&mdash;the sergeant tries a 'sighter'. The lieutenant
raises his glasses.</p>

<p>The Boers must be lying low along the edge of the depression
nearest us to fire. It is not deep enough to shelter them as they
walk about.</p>

<p>"Try nine hundred," says the officer.</p>

<p>Tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!&mdash;obediently replies the
Maxim.</p>

<p>"Too short; make it a thousand."
Tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat&mdash;into one long
volume of speedy firing, the little gun raps out its stream of
bullets&mdash;four hundred to the minute. The empty
cartridge-cases, flying from the breech in a continuous stream too
swift to see, tinkle on the ground ceaselessly. The belt empties
itself&mdash;the spitting tube ceases its energetic babble for a
moment or two, as a new belt is fitted on; then begins again. The
sergeant sweeps the barrel about, pauses, tries new
ranges&mdash;handles the gun as one who knows its every whim. He is
a fine cool man that sergeant, and a very handsome one. Under the
hailing nickel he sits and works that invaluable weapon
deliberately, steadily, competently. He is the very centre of a
little dust-storm raised by the pelting bullets. The Boers are
making a target of the gun. Yet he is never scratched. One of the
detachment is shot through the chest as he bends over a box of
cartridge-belts. He sits in the grass, coughing out his lungs.</p>

<p>There is something brisk and inspiriting about the cheerful
tapping of a Maxim in action. It has the air of one who says, "Keep
it going, lads. Keep it going&mdash;we're knocking spots out of
them!"</p>

<p>The edge of the depression from which the Boers had opened fire
must have been a 'warm' spot under that pouring torrent of bullets,
both from the machine gun and the carbines of the three squadrons.
Under their combined influence the Boer fire slackened and died
away gradually, a few lone whistles in the air, long after the main
body must have evacuated the spruit, telling of the few brave men
who were the last to leave&mdash;the Commandant and Field Cornets
probably, staying behind after the men had refused to face it
longer, to fire a parting shot or two at the hated English, in
bitterness of soul and disappointment. It must be a hard thing for
a gallant man, ready to sacrifice his own life&mdash;nominally
commanding troops who have such liberty to use their own discretion
as the Boer armies had&mdash;to contain his soul in comfort when
his men refuse to carry out his orders.</p>

<p>We are left in peace again. The damage with us is
slight&mdash;one man's coat ripped, and one man with a bullet
through his forearm&mdash;but down the ridge one can see a doctor
hurrying from heap to heap, and a few limp forms being carried down
to the foot of the ridge. Their position was more exposed and less
adapted to taking cover than was ours. Also, they probably did not
possess quite such an aptitude for 'taking cover' as the
Cornstalks.</p>

<p>The man of the Maxim detachment who was wounded ten minutes ago
is dead. He lies face downward in the grass, with his head resting
on his folded arms and one leg crossed over the other&mdash;just as
though asleep. Some one rolls him over to feel his heart. His eyes
are half closed, and he is smiling through a hideous slobber of
blood about the mouth. In his chest is a tiny hole, but in his
back&mdash;a gaping, spongy rent. The kind of wound the soft-nose
makes.</p>

<p>They buried him presently behind the ridge; and the ground was
so hard that they could only dig the grave eighteen inches deep. So
they had to pile stones above him. A friend belonging to the gun
detachment had laconically remarked: "Puir old Jock&mdash;he wasna'
a bad bloke". That was his obituary; and, if you come to think of
it, you and I will not have done so badly if some one can say that
of us when our time has come.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock now, and the sun was getting low. The silly
convoy was crossing the river behind us, and coming over the plain
after the Division. That is just the senseless way of
convoys&mdash;they never know that there are any shells to be drawn
until one lands in an ammunition-waggon. It is very amusing to see
a convoy getting shelled. We watched anxiously from the ridge in
expectation of some entertainment.</p>

<p>The fighting was all very far to the left front now. The
Division seemed to have been trying to sneak round the right flank
of the Boer position all day. At one time, by pushing the Horse
Batteries up under the fire of Long Tom, they had succeeded in
silencing one of the great bullies; but the other two had spoken
with such good effect that the batteries had been compelled to
withdraw to a safer distance, and our friend of the tufting smoke,
who had been also temporarily withdrawn, came back again and sang
his song as merrily as ever.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary sight that we beheld from our ridge late
in the afternoon. The main part of the three brigades were massed
upon a slope&mdash;or seeming to be massed&mdash;three miles away.
In front of them, and hopelessly outranged, were the little
'twelve-pounders,' vainly replying to the big guns of the Boers.
All the time the huge shells were dropping amongst our fellows,
throwing up great spouting splashes of red dust plainly visible
from where we stood. The far away boom of the cannon was ceaseless,
regular, ominous. And it seemed to us that the slaughter in the
Division must be awful. But it was not so. All the
afternoon&mdash;we learned next day&mdash;they had had but two men
killed and some twenty wounded.</p>

<p>Ah! Long Tom had espied the convoy. The shell burst close beside
the line of waggons. The column of transport halted as if undecided
what to do or how to do it. Another great burst seemed to tear up
the veldt, even in the midst of all the crowded waggons. From our
far-off position we could hear demoniac yells and screaming of the
Kaffir drivers and the volleying creaking of their whips.</p>

<p>Another explosion just beyond the line. All seemed to be in a
hopeless confusion, but at last we could see that the teams were
turning about and beginning to literally race back over the way
they had come. Of course it was all they could do.</p>

<p>But, vividly as one might realise how very unpleasant a thing it
must be to drive a waggon with those howling hundred-pounders
dropping all about, one could not help laughing at the way in which
the Kaffirs bestirred themselves to reach a safer position. The
long string of carts and waggons had come crawling up from the
river, as though protesting against being dragged along until so
late an hour in the day&mdash;the very slowness of their march
seeming to say, "See how tired we are!" Now, their teams galloped.
It was a scurry back to safety. They had barely come within the
range of the big gun when he opened on them, but the first
half-mile of their retirement was as a chariot race.</p>

<p>Right up to dark the Division clung to its uncomfortable
position. The cannon on the Berg boomed without pause. As the red
sun went down behind the purple hills, and the short twilight
merged into darkness, the flashes of their guns and ours were
distinct and clear, and the quick flame of the bursting shells
looked like a mammoth firework display. Shrapnel crashing in the
darkness has a very fine effect. You see the flash of the gun,
sudden and quick, as it is fired; then, as the 'boom-m' comes to
you, the shell explodes in the black sky like a great cracker flung
high aloft. A pom-pom winks as a signal-lamp, and the little shells
striking on the ground are a series of sharp bursts of light.</p>

<p>At dusk the two Cavalry Brigades retired across the river. One
by one the great guns ceased to fire. Last of all to stop work was
the energetic pom-pom.</p>

<p>Hutton's Brigade stayed to hold the position. We rode
back&mdash;tired, dejected, hungry&mdash;unable to comprehend it
all, and believing, though none liked to say it, that we had at
last sustained a reverse.</p>

<p>However, it was not a reverse. We did not know until next day
that we had simply been keeping Louis Botha and his guns employed
whilst Lord Roberts came to Elandsfontein and threatened
Johannesburg.</p>

<p>In the camp that night no one was noticeably cheerful. But there
was an issue of bully-beef and biscuits, and to men who had fasted
and worked hard for more than thirty hours on end, these delicacies
were more acceptable than would have been the finest dishes
gourmand ever dreamed upon.</p>

<p>So we lay down to rest&mdash;battle-stained, weary and
unreflective. The cold night closed over the camps by river and
Berg. The blessed sleep and rest came welcomely alike to Boer, and
Briton, and Tommy Cornstalk.</p>

<p>All the following morning, when we had returned to our places,
we drew their steady artillery-fire; but at noon came Ian Hamilton
with many men and, best sight of all, his two great
'cow-guns'&mdash;six-inch naval giants drawn by thirty-two bullocks
apiece, and having another thirty-two to each timber. Four rounds
from them and Long Tom was silently employed in getting himself
down to the threatened railway, as were also his brethren of the
other positions.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX - THE HOSPITAL</h2>

<p>So much has been said, so much written in magazines and
newspapers upon the hospital arrangements in South Africa during
the war that one may well hesitate before venturing to criticise,
or even to speak of one's experiences in, the Military Hospitals.
Members of the Commons have risen up and made statements, to which
Generals and heads of departments have made quite opposite
statements in reply. Civilians and Soldiers, Society Women and
Clergymen, have all argued so much, in this way and in that, upon
the good and bad points of the whole Army Medical organisation,
that a mere Cornstalk Tommy may well ask pardon for diffidence in
approaching a subject upon which the fierce glare of public
criticism has, on the whole, shone so adversely. It is a cowardly
thing 'to kick a man when he is down'. And nothing in the world has
ever been so 'down' in the public estimation as the medical
arrangements in South Africa.</p>

<p>In all matters where sins of omission may be charged to the
defaulters' sheet of the powers that be, there will always be found
ready listeners to any tale of wrong. If you throw enough mud some
of it is sure to stick. If you wish to advertise yourself, there is
no better or safer way of doing so than by attacking somebody who
may not hit back.</p>

<p>One would like best to have written of life in the hospitals as
a new experience, as a state of being with which one's readers are
not familiar. Life in an hospital ward would present as varied and
picturesque sides as in the bivouac and battle. The strange wounds,
the queer diseases, the grisly deaths&mdash;would all go to form a
narrative as interesting, as many-sided, as harrowing or ennobling
as the most vividly recounted tale of march and fight. There are
stories of as great a heroism amongst the men and women who
wrestled with the fierce pestilence of Bloemfontein, Kroonstad and
Pretoria, and who laid down their worn-out lives in the disgusting
atmosphere of lazarette surroundings, as there are of those who
died in open veldt from bullet and shell. There are stories, too,
of as great wickedness, as bad and evil affairs as one may ever
shudder to hear. Whispered tales, many of them, that you hear as
you walk about the lines of marquee tents, in the ships coming
home, in divers places where you meet the men who know and have no
object in lying. There is good to be told, and evil to be told.
There is much that, for the credit of all concerned, should know
the light, and very much that, for utter shame of telling, should
never in all the after time be spoken.</p>

<p>There is a temptation to air one's views, to grow prolix
regarding the manner in which men should have been tended&mdash;to
suggest, to point out, to dabble in matters which none but
professional men may properly comprehend. It is 'cheap' and easy to
criticise; it is difficult to have sympathy with a popularly abused
state of affairs&mdash;to extenuate, to excuse. One desires, of
course, to speak without bias or ill-feeling and to suggest, from
experience of the actual working of the system, how it may be
improved. But the lay ignorance of cause and effect, of undoubted
difficulties in transport and supply, and of the circumstances
generally, together with the wanton and ignorant manner in which
the law has been laid down by all and sundry compel one, in simple
fairness to those who may be responsible, to refrain from all but
the most deliberate and well-advised statement.</p>

<p>One would, for instance, have the pleasant feeling of doing a
public service were one to propose in print that the Royal Army
Medical Corps should be better paid than it is. One might point out
that the ranking of doctors according to military usage is a
pernicious and ill-advised system. It would be delightful to
demonstrate that the scum of England are not the class from which
tender and devoted nurses of fever patients can be reasonably
expected to be drawn. It would be gratifying to show that the
equipment of the Peninsular period should give place to that of the
<i>fin-de-siècle</i>, state-aided establishment; that amputations and liver
pills are not the justifiable curealls that army doctors might be
supposed to consider them to be in all surgical and medical cases.
In short, it would be the easiest thing in the world to publish
one's own humble opinion as to the good and the bad, the right and
the wrong, the wisdom and the foolishness in the organisation,
equipment and management of Field, Stationary and Base
Hospitals.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and this is a very important 'but,' which it might
have been wise of certain M.P.'s, critical civilians, and
correspondents to remember&mdash;is it quite fair to do so? Is it
right and just to set down an opinion at all about anything, until
one knows well and intimately all the details concerning the case
under discussion? Is it proper for a mere 'casual' to criticise the
work&mdash;in all its shortcomings and many excellencies&mdash;of a
system which men of great professional experience and large
knowledge have built up in years of practical hard work? One
remembers too well that awful period of waiting at Bloemfontein
whilst the army rotted inactive, and the little cemetery under the
old fort filled and overflowed; when officer, and comrade, and
inferior went down alike before the sickle of that grim
reaper&mdash;Enteric. There is too sad a memory of the delirious,
dying men who babbled, in the close wards, of far-off places where
there were peace and love. There is no forgetting the carts that
rumbled through the streets loaded with those stiff,
blanket-shrouded shapes which had been vigorous men&mdash;the
dwindling squadrons, the crowded sick-tents, the unfed, unwashed,
unhappy men who filled them, will never cease to linger in one's
memory. And, if one thinks of all these things, one may be bitter,
too, against a system which, rightly or wrongly, has had much of
the responsibility of them laid at its door.</p>

<p>So, all things considered, it is not well to write as one would
perhaps have done unthinkingly, to venture too emphatic opinions as
to men and methods, lest one do unwitting injustice to those to
whom all the credit they can claim will not come amiss. Wherefore,
the writer proposes to merely recount some of his own personal
experiences as a patient in various military hospitals between
Pretoria and the Cape, and to leave the reader of these pages to
form his own opinion as to the right and wrong, the folly and the
wisdom of it all.</p>

<p>We were nine miles from Pretoria when it happened&mdash;almost
north-east. The Brigade was hurriedly saddling-up in the cold
darkness before the dawn of a July day. The carts were being
loaded. Some one had sent the writer to the top of one of them to
assist in the stowing of oat-sacks and biscuit-boxes. The work
finished, an eight feet jump from the top had been rashly
negotiated. There had been a little stone, that rolled beneath
one's foot upon the ground. And the little stone was responsible
for a damaged ankle that prevented one from walking, and pained
enough for two broken legs. And then, because orders were hurried
and imperative, the squadron had ridden away and left one lying
upon one's kit in the open veldt.</p>

<p>The long and the short of it was that there was no ambulance van
to carry us into Pretoria. Beside the writer there were two sick
men of his own corps and some twenty of the three English regiments
that made up the Brigade. An old 'spider'&mdash;a four-wheeled
waggonette, commandeered from some farm&mdash;had been left behind,
and, with a couple of debilitated mules as motive power, the
various kits and possessions of the dismounted men who remained
were to be carried into Pretoria on it. Kindly arms lifted the
writer to the top of the piled-up baggage, and by dint of prodding
with naked swords, butts of carbines, and other impromptu goads the
worn out animals were induced to commence their unsteady trek into
the Transvaal capital.</p>

<p>But the rolled kits fell off at intervals, the waggonette jolted
mercilessly, and the ride was so comfortless and painful that,
after half a mile had been traversed and the roadside that led into
town from Kamiel Drift reached, we were constrained to beg our
conductors to leave us there, on the faint chance of being conveyed
into Pretoria by some Army Service waggon going in to get supplies
for the troops that held the hills by Derdepoort. And so we were
left lying on the grass&mdash;and there seemed to be every
likelihood of our staying there indefinitely.</p>

<p>The red road stretched out to the gap in the hills where the
infantry camp was, and, in the other direction, round the end of an
intermediate ridge, to Pretoria. Men came by on horseback and in
Cape carts, and there was one on a bicycle; but that day the Army
Service Corps seemed to be resting. The sun went up into the deep
blue, and the beautiful day grew older by two hours. Specklike on
the sky-line one could see the black dots of pickets who were
watching Louis Botha from the hills.</p>

<p>From seven until eleven we lay by the roadside, and no good
Samaritan passed by. Once there came a mule-cart with a Kaffir
driving, and one of the two who were able to walk begged him for a
ride into Pretoria and the hospitals.</p>

<p>"Nie, baas," he replied; "mule too tire. No can carry some
more."</p>

<p>"You black beast!" remarked his interlocutor; "you black
swine!&mdash;if I felt a bit stronger I'd <i>commandeer</i> your dam team
and make you walk!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Kaffir was quite in the right. The welfare of
his team should have been, and was, his first consideration. He
merely smiled, and passed on.</p>

<p>It grew to be dreary waiting for what might never come. Had we
had any rations and not been ill and crippled, to stay there would
not have troubled us overmuch, but as it was&mdash;far from water,
one of us seeming to sicken for fever, another hardly able to walk,
and the third quite incapable of standing and whose only means of
locomotion lay in what he could do by hopping, the outlook was
alarming and miserable enough.</p>

<p>But at length, in a cloud of red dust, there came a
slate-coloured empty waggon along the road. A brick-faced sergeant
with a flaxen beard sat upon the box beside the black driver.
Languidly the prospective enteric case shuffled into the road, and
took up a position in such a place that the team of mules must
either run over him or stop. They stopped.</p>

<p>"Now then, laad," said the sergeant, "what for be ye blockin' t'
road? Doan't y' know we be in a dom hurry t' git some bre'd from
P'toria? Stan' a won soide&mdash;there's a good laad!"</p>

<p>Wearily our envoy explained the situation.</p>

<p>"Who be ye?" asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"'Stralian Horse," said the sick man.</p>

<p>"Oa, aye&mdash;ye be t' Orsetrailyans, be ye? Well, kom along,
laads. Rackon there's room f' ye, if ye kom from Orsetrailyer. Me
brother Dick went there. Whaat!&mdash;can't th' laad walk? Bide a
bit, naow, an' I'll gie ye a han'."</p>

<p>So, finally, we came into the Market Square&mdash;shaken and
tired and sick with pain&mdash;and were left upon the pavement by
the new hospital in the Law Courts. We lay upon our kits on the red
tiles, and contemplated the Dutch Church, and the pedestal that had
been built to hold Paul Kruger, and the magnificent Raadzaal with
the gilt angel soaring from its roof, and the flapping Union Jack
mocking it in the breeze. And it seemed that we might lie there
also indefinitely. No one came to ask us whom we might be or why we
sat there waiting. Generals and Tommies,</p>

<p>Colonels and Burghers walked past and hardly looked at us. There
was no room for sick men in the world of war.</p>

<p>They had put a square of galvanised iron fencing about the front
of the Law Courts, between the high steps and the Church.</p>

<p>"I think we'll go in there," suggested the man with the
headache; "we might have more of a show to get to bed if we go in
there."</p>

<p>So we went in and squatted upon the lowest step, and an orderly
came and looked at us, and went away into a corner to smoke. The
thought came to one: "And there was a certain beggar named
Lazarus...moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores".</p>

<p>The clock in the Raadzaal front marked the quarter, half,
three-quarters&mdash;and no one came. Just before the hour was
reached a medical officer strolled out on to the terrace above and
surveyed us. "What are you men doing theah?" he queried, shaking a
surgical knife at us; "why don't you come to attention?"</p>

<p>He of the aching head and stomachic pains climbed up the steps.
He seemed to be trying his best to stand to attention, but it was a
dismal failure, to say the most of it. The nonchalant surgeon
conversed with him awhile, and the two of them came down to us.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;you men," he said, "you men, you know, you ought to
have gone to a Field Hospital. Why didn't you go to a Field
Hospital? What? Can't possibly take you in heah unless they send
you from a Field Hospital, you know. 'Gainst all rules. Quite
irregular, you know. What? No, we can't possibly admit you. Beds
all full, you know. Quite out of the question!"</p>

<p>"We don't want beds, sir. Can't we come in and camp on the
floor? We're used to sleeping on the ground."</p>

<p>"Oh, deah, no! We don't do that kind of thing heah, you know.
Don't know what you had better do, I'm suah. Don't ask me. Can't
you go to the Rest Camp?" And he strolled inside. We felt that we
were the scum of the earth. But our turn was to come.</p>

<p>A man came riding through the iron gate on a fine bay horse, and
instantly the orderly sprang to attend him. He alighted as one who
knows all about a saddle, and handed the bridle reins to the
obsequious 'Tommy'. It seemed to us that there never could have
been so soldierly or so fine a man to look at. 'Gentleman,' too,
was written all over him. He was a tall, dark-complexioned
man&mdash;well-preserved, and somewhere between fifty and sixty. A
black moustache and a tuft of hair upon his chin, after the manner
of Lord Roberts, gave him a somewhat foreign aspect. He wore the
flat, German-pattern staff-cap of khaki with the red band round it,
and the red lapels upon the collar of his tunic that indicated
staff rank. As he ran actively up the steps into the hospital he
glanced curiously and keenly at us, half-paused, and went on
inside. We must have been a picturesque trio enough to turn the
gaze of any man who had not a soul enmeshed in red tape. The sick
man was gaunt, unshaven, hollow-eyed and pale; the man with the
blistered feet was slim, larrikin-like and alert; the writer was
minus boot, and spur, and puttee, as regarded his right extremity,
and dirtier and more unkempt than he had ever thought he would
become. We had been out getting shelled all the day before&mdash;on
a big reconnaissance&mdash;and had come in late, so that there was
no chance of washing or shaving before the morning's daylight
start. Therefore, it was nearly three days since we had used soap
and water.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes, and the handsome staff-colonel was striding down
the stone steps. As he came to the bottom one on which we sat
forlornly he stopped, and spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well men, what is your trouble? Why don't you go inside?
Wounded, eh?" "No, sir; twisted ankle&mdash;can't walk."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I feel very sick, sir. Headache&mdash;weak."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Skin orf one foot, sir. Can't walk or ride. Blood-pois'nin', I
think."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you go in and get attended to? Who are
you?"</p>

<p>We told him that we were Australians, and that we had sought
admission unsuccessfully, and had not the least idea now as to what
we should do.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're Australians, are you? Well, your fellows have done
some good work. Stop here. I'll go and see what can be done." And
he went up the steps two at a time.</p>

<p>To be an Australian seemed to be something of a distinction
here. But it is curiously true that no matter with whom, if you
said you were an Australian you had a much easier time and got what
you wanted more readily than before it was known from whence you
hailed. Perhaps they made allowance for our ignorance.</p>

<p>Down he came again, followed by three anxious-looking medical
officers, chief amongst whom was the tired individual who had been
unable to give us room.</p>

<p>"Now," said that angel in disguise, "now <i>why</i> are these men left
here?"</p>

<p>"We really have no room for more, sir. The waggons are still at
Nitral's Nek, and we expect another convoy in to-night. It is quite
impossible to take them in."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I really do not see how the matter affects us, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you not? Ah!&mdash;well, sir, it <i>should</i> affect you! And it
<i>will</i> affect you. Do you think it a very creditable thing to your
Hospital that these men should have been sitting here for nearly
two hours without food or water or any apparent chance of ever
obtaining any? Do you not consider that, since you have become
aware of the case, you would have done rightly if you had passed
them on to another Hospital where there might be room for them? I
think that you have been very remiss in your duty, sir.</p>

<p>"Now will you kindly write a note to the P.M.O. of some other
Hospital where you think they may be taken in&mdash;explaining the
case to him. Where do you think they would be likely to find
room?"</p>

<p>The man who disliked irregularity seemed to have become quite
contrite by this time. Evidently the Staff Officer was a great gun,
since all stood so much in awe of him.</p>

<p>"I think they might get into the Racecourse Hospital, sir. They
can expand their quarters there&mdash;plenty of sheds and
buildings, you know. We cannot here." "Well&mdash;give them the
note."</p>

<p>He strode out of the enclosure, and presently reappeared with a
cab.</p>

<p>"Jump in, men," he said. "Up to the Racecourse, driver. You'll
be all right now, eh?"&mdash;and he was on to his horse and gone
almost before we could thank him.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that that officer will ever see these pages. We
never heard his name, nor did we meet him again, but if he be alive
and should chance to drop across this book and does not forget the
incident, he will know that three sick Cornstalks were very, very
grateful to him for his kindness that morning by the Law Courts.
His courteous care for the welfare of three dirty vagabonds is one
of those things which only the Recording Angel books to a man's
credit. He was in this, and doubtless always, following in the
steps of his great leader, and ours&mdash;the soldier's warmest
friend&mdash;Lord Roberts.</p>

<p>So down Church Street, past Paul Kruger's lion-fronted dwelling,
past his beloved Dopper Church with the unfinished clock in the
steeple, up towards the railway, across some open ground, and we
came to the Racecourse, which, having been in the early war time a
prison, was now an hospital.</p>

<p>It was a good course&mdash;one could see that with half an
eye&mdash;but it made a wofully bad hospital.</p>

<p>Here, also, it seemed that we exhibited the usual bad taste in
not applying for admission in the regular and pre-ordained form. A
fat sergeant-major of the R.A.M.C. was for turning us away
again&mdash;which would have been awkward, seeing that we had
dismissed the cab. But the embryo enteric flared into righteous
wrath; wished to know whether we were luridly qualified stray dogs,
or what; claimed personal friendship with the P.M.O., and demanded
that he should be shown where that officer abided, so that he might
himself present our letter of introduction.</p>

<p>Such a queer place for sick men to go in&mdash;such a quaint,
unconventional, singular kind of hospital&mdash;you never saw! What
the conditions of life were in the grand stand, or the saddling
paddock, or in the big pavilion where the luncheons might have
been, none of us could say. We lived in loose-boxes in the
stables&mdash;and to this day one of us pricks up his ears when he
hears corn rattle in a box, or beholds horses feeding out of bins.
It was a long galvanised-iron shed. There was a passage down the
middle, with a door at either end, presumably for ventilation. Sick
Kaffirs dwelt in the passage, and rendered both night and day
hideous with their chatter. Widely projecting eaves made a kind of
verandah all round the building. The doors of each stall were in
two halves, after the kind of stable-doors. In front they looked
out across the level ground about which lay the course, and in rear
on to a tidy garden shaded by gum and wattle. We were assigned
quarters in the front.</p>

<p>Many days we lived there, not getting overmuch attention
medically, but still living&mdash;which was something. If you had
good luck you obtained a bag or two to spread out ere you laid your
blankets on the ground. This was the ward where slight wounds,
rheumatisms, sprains, mild dysenterics, and ripening enterics 'most
did congregate'. Here, also, were the malingerers. It was
astonishing, and rather appalling, to note the number of hale
beings who lived in hospital. Sad and humiliating as it must seem,
any man who has been through the Military Hospitals can quite
easily testify to the truth of this. 'Fed up' often seemed to be
about to assume just as alarming proportions as enteric. How they
did it was a mystery. One can only assume that, in many cases, the
medical officers, though morally certain that a man might be
shamming, were too disgusted to take the necessary steps towards
'bowling him out'. And, indeed, dealing with the typical 'old
soldier,' hardly any measures in the world, severely preventive or
otherwise, would keep him out of hospital were he desirous of
staying in. If a man steadily persist in having a pain in his
chest, and be fairly consistent in his symptoms, you cannot,
without very great difficulty, prove him a liar. And as the doctors
had always very much more to do than time to do it in, they could
not afford the almost detective-like vigilance necessary to
properly meet the cases of such wily characters.</p>

<p>A <i>résumé</i> of the day's doings in our stable may perhaps give the
reader some idea of what life in this most rudimentary of hospitals
was like. It is well to bear in mind, however, that these were the
first months of the British occupation of Pretoria, that De Wet was
blowing up the railway every day on the other side of the Vaal,
that fever and dysentery were rife in all the camps about the town,
and that it was utterly impossible to obtain many of the most
essential supplies required by an hospital. When you come to
consider these points it is wonderful what the Medical Staff did
even so primitively well as they did.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight a bugler sounded the 'reveille'&mdash;most
beautiful, if most unwelcome of 'calls'. Half an hour later an
aggressive individual walked hurriedly along the stable front, and
rattled a stick against the corrugated-iron doors. If that did not
bring your slumbers to an end nothing would do so. If you could
stand, or hop, you arose and opened the doors of your compartment,
and yawned in the fresh air. There was a pump by the side of the
track whereat you might perform your toilet. You folded up your
blankets, and tidied the den as well as might be. Then came another
orderly with a basket full of cut loaves of bread. You received a
piece, supposed to weigh one pound, which was to last you all day.
Sometimes he threw it at you&mdash;and on those occasions you were
not quite certain as to whether your habitation were a loose-box or
a kennel. Humourists used sometimes to request to be supplied with
a bran mash, complaining pathetically that they felt 'a bit out of
condition'.</p>

<p>At half-past seven buckets of tea arrived in the open before the
sheds. Cripples, and ill, and shams hobbled, and slouched, and
rushed with empty beeftins, mess-cans, jam-pots&mdash;anything that
would hold water. Eating and drinking utensils were not supplied in
that part of the hospital. You somehow got some tea and ate some
bread. Every second day a pot of jam was served out to each four
men. After breakfast the stalls were still further tidied, the pots
polished and hung up on the wooden partitions, and the front of the
shed swept and garnished.</p>

<p>And at 9 a.m. there came the P.M.O.&mdash;the Great Finality of
the establishment. At the Racecourse he was a very popular
person&mdash;a man with a face that you might trust, the quiet air
of one who knew his task, and the kindly sympathy of a good
physician, even yet unspoiled by the years of narrowing army
service. Everybody liked the Major&mdash;we did not hear his
name&mdash;and he seemed to like every one. In spite of the fact
that his hospital was probably as rough and primitive as any you
might come to in all Africa, the mere fact of there being so
likeable a man at the head of it atoned for very much in which it
fell grievously short of perfection. One can still think with
affection of the man&mdash;his grave, clean-cut, kindly face, with
the iron-grey, close-cropped hair about the temples; the slightly
stooping figure and the pleasant laugh. And the remembrance of his
quiet courtesy of speech, and the close attention with which he
listened to what you had to say is a gleam of sunshine over a
retrospective outlook that is dreary, and sordid, and commonplace
enough. He was cruelly handicapped by want of the most necessary
things in carrying out his work, but no one left that disreputable
place who had not, at least, a good word for the Major.</p>

<p>At noon the buckets brought soup with raggy meat in it. There
was milk for those who were nominally on 'milk diet,' but as
everything was much in common the patients ate, as a rule, what
they considered best suited to their tastes, diseases, or
constitutions. All the afternoon was a long 'loaf'. You slept, or
read, or wrote letters home, and at 4.30 came more tea, with which
you finished the remainder of the bread and jam.</p>

<p>Night came&mdash;and you smoked, and yarned, and went to bed in
the dust. And byand-bye, when the long-winded ones had ceased to
talk in dialects, and brogues, and twangs, and all&mdash;even the
vociferous Kaffirs&mdash;were asleep and still, rats ran about over
your head, and nibbled your hair.</p>

<p>Ten days of this, and the writer was one morning, with some
thirty others, conveyed in ambulance-vans to the Pretoria railway
station, and started off in a bullet-marked carriage to Cape Town,
with five days' rations of bread, and bully-beef, and jam. At
least, we thought we were being sent to Cape Town&mdash;but when
you start upon a journey at one end of a military railway which
runs through an only partially subjugated hostile territory, you do
not really know whether it will be a week, or a month, or a year,
or all eternity before you reach your journey's end. This time the
journey took two months.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X - THE HOSPITAL
(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>

<p>THE train ran through the hills between two of the silent forts,
which had cost so much money and had been of so little use to their
builders, and out from the valley of Pretoria into the open veldt.
The track of the invading army still lay beside the line. The
traffic of the convoys had worn the grass away, and the road was
mile-stoned by the parched hides and whitened bones of horses,
mules, and oxen, and, less frequently, by the red-mounded, final
resting-places of men. Many had remained to 'settle on the land,'
but the tenure of their occupation was probably more permanent and
abiding than most of the poor fellows had expected it to be.</p>

<p>Past the little wayside stations of Kaalfontein, Zuurfontein,
and various other fonteins&mdash;and about three o'clock we arrived
at Elandsfontein, the junction of the Cape and Natal lines to
Pretoria and of the short six-mile one which ran into
Johannesburg.</p>

<p>The train waited ten minutes, twenty minutes&mdash;an hour.
Coffee was brought to us in the carriages&mdash;drunk&mdash;the
bucket taken away again by a Kaffir, and still we moved
not&mdash;no one knowing why.</p>

<p>At length we went on. Somehow it seemed to us all wrong. We
should have been rolling across the open veldt again, but we were
instead passing through the suburbs of a great city, and every
moment the houses grew larger and denser. It was like coming into
Melbourne in the afternoon&mdash;except for the tall smoke-stacks
of occasional mines, and the stampers, and the big cyanide vats.
Past little suburban stations&mdash;as 'Zimmer and Jack' and
Jeppestown&mdash;in through gardens, and trees, and pretty suburban
streets, along a cutting and below a bridge, and we ran in under a
high domed roof of glass, and came to a standstill beside one of
the platforms of a great railway station, much larger and finer
than Redfern, or Flinders Street, or the North Terrace.</p>

<p>It was Park Station&mdash;and then we remembered having seen it
before, when the illustrated papers made pictures of the refugees
crowding into open trucks, in the mad rush of September to get
away. And we remembered another picture of a commando going to the
Front, and wondered vaguely where all those bandoliered and booted
warriors were now. They were in graves, and at Simon's Bay and St.
Helena, and in the veldt still; and we held their towns and railway
systems&mdash;but had we finished yet? How long was it to be before
those silent streets of the outskirts should fill again, before
this great station should hum with the busy life of the resurrected
city, before the black smoke lifted above the chimneys of the
mines, and the great town should have recovered from the paralysis
of war?</p>

<p>As we waited there we heard the wherefore of our waiting. The
line had again been blown up, just beyond the Vaal. Popular rumour
credited Christian De Wet with the deed, and probably rumour, for
once, was right. Most of us had a sneaking regard for De Wet, and
looked upon him as a great, though sometimes inconvenient
man&mdash;but this afternoon upon that train he was exceedingly
unpopular.</p>

<p>By-and-bye they shunted us into a siding, and commanded us to
'get out,' and so we alighted as well as we could, and sat upon our
kits beside the carriages and trucks. As dusk settled down over the
town, ambulance-waggons came and carried us away to the Amblers'
Club, where was located Number 'K General Hospital. There they put
us into bell-tents, pitched on the football-ground&mdash;four in a
tent&mdash;and they fed us on bovril and bread, and we slept upon
stretchers, which was the nearest approach we had made to sleeping
in beds for nearly a year, and was a decided improvement upon the
litter and dust of our late quarters in the horse-stalls. It was
dark when we arrived, and beyond the fact that great buildings
within high trees and park-like grounds loomed vaguely in the
blackness, and the faint white showing of many marquees and
bell-tents glimmered obscurely about us, we could make little of
our situation and environment.</p>

<p>Next morning was beautifully cold, and clear, and fresh. No wind
stirred the tops of the tall blue gums that, hedge-like, surrounded
all the enclosure. The buildings of the Club stood up amidst them,
picturesque in their setting of green leaves. Part was unfinished,
with the scaffold poles and ladders still erected about its raw and
new-looking brick walls. There had been a fire before the war, and
the outbreak of hostilities had left the work of restoration
incomplete.</p>

<p>The tents we occupied were pitched upon a grassless square of
recreation ground. Tiers of wooden seats surrounded the enclosure.
Below it was another square, and, in the front of the building, an
excellent cycling track and cricket ground, and still more
excellent tennis courts. The great concert hall of the Club was
used as a ward for the more serious cases. It contained beds with
real sheets and real pillows. They struck one as being useless,
unnecessary adjuncts of an effete civilisation, after so many
months of doing without them. Even the loose-boxes at Pretoria had
seemed at first to be commodious residences. It is only afterwards
that you look back and shudder. Comfort is a matter of comparison.
To the sick soldier lying in the veldt on a wet night a hollow log,
or the lee of a paling fence, would seem the very acme of luxury.
But when you get to civilisation again the reputation of necessary
insecticide will hopelessly damn an hotel in your estimation, and
you will quite easily turn up your nose at food for which, in
bivouac or on outpost, you would have bartered your last 'fill' of
tobacco.</p>

<p>On the whole, the hospital in the Amblers' Club was an
improvement upon that of the Pretorian Racecourse. In the first
place, the condition and location of the buildings and grounds were
in every way suitable for an hospital. Centrally situated as to the
city, not fifty yards from the principal railway station, amply
large in its grounds for the exercising of convalescent patients,
surrounded on all sides by wide streets, and with a high
galvanised-iron fence having but two main entrances&mdash;both from
the points of view of its administration and of its patients no
site or arrangements could possibly have been better adapted for
the successful treatment of sick and wounded and the maintenance of
necessary discipline than were those of the one in question.</p>

<p>We were more comfortable in the little tents, though it was
strange how full four stretchers and their occupants made them
seem, even after the usual dozen or fifteen human beings who
smothered in them in the ordinary standing camps. The food,
although practically the same as supplied to us at the Racecourse,
was better cooked and better served, but in this bracing climate of
cold, clear, winter weather, to men whose naturally fine appetites
were in no wise impaired by their physical injuries, the ration
scale was wofully insufficient.</p>

<p>A very excellent thing was the fact that for the most part the
hospital, or at least the division of it in which we were, was
served by orderlies of the St. John's Ambulance Association.</p>

<p>There is no branch of the Imperial Army so generally unpopular
with all other branches as the Royal Army Medical Corps. This is a
large, loose statement apparently, but it is unfortunately none the
less perfectly true. Were one to account for it by stories heard in
and out of the hospital one might possibly be merely repeating
calumnious untruths, but there is much, apart from hearsay, that
one has seen oneself, and which all Colonial soldiers have seen
also, to render fairly evident Tommy Atkins' dislike as a class to
the privates and non-commissioned officers of the corps. He seems
to regard the men of the R.A.M.C. as being essentially on a lower
plane than himself. He has bestowed upon them contemptuously the
appellations of 'Poultice Wallopers,' 'Linseed Lancers,' and other
insulting and more ribald designations too Atkinesque to mention.
As a primary reason for having incurred Tommy's bitter dislike it
may be that the rank and file of the R.A.M.C., being technically
non-combatants, are unreasonably looked down upon by men who are.
And, when he 'goes sick,' Tommy has to do just what he is told by
these despised beings&mdash;which is, doubtless, very galling to
Tommy. "So," says he, "w'en we meets the swine artside, we breaks
their bleedin' 'eads. If they sees yer comin' darn the street, w'y
they bloomin' well dodges hup a halley."</p>

<p>Personally, one is almost ready to excuse many of the
shortcomings of the much-abused orderlies, by consideration of the
fact that you cannot expect the services of a perfect being when
you pay him something that comes to a little more than a shilling a
day. If a good personnel is required, then it will have to be paid
for. And you won't get 'much of a man' to do the kind of work the
R.A.M.C. are called upon to do under five.</p>

<p>Now the men of the St. John's Ambulance Association were
volunteers and enthusiasts, besides being, in ordinary life, men of
a very much higher social grade than the class from which the
private regular soldier is usually drawn. They therefore took more
interest in their work than did the men of the R.A.M.C. They may
not, perhaps, have been quite so well trained and disciplined, but
they were certainly kinder, gentler, and more sympathetic in their
treatment of patients than were the regular orderlies. And so they
incurred Tommy's gratitude and esteem&mdash;since Tommy is a
gentleman who is nothing if not just in his estimate of superiors
and equals.</p>

<p>The routine is much the same as at the Racecourse. 'Reveille'
sounds early, and presently there comes the ward-master, usually a
sergeant, to turn you out. Blankets are folded, and stacked neatly
at the head of each stretcher. The walls of the tent are rolled up,
and its interior and immediate vicinity swept and cleaned, after
breakfast has been served, so that the resultant crumbs may not
meet the eye of the visiting medical officer. In the meantime, if
you are physically capable of so doing, you go for a wash.</p>

<p>Now here is the worst one has to say of this
otherwise&mdash;considering the circumstances and the
times&mdash;exceptionally well-regulated and administered
establishment. At one end of the main building of the Club stood a
long wooden trough, raised some three feet above the ground on
trestles. Each morning it was filled with water from a stand-pipe,
and in it scores of men performed their ablutions. One may imagine
that the water became fairly 'thick' after a little time each
morning. Well, that did not matter so much. You cease to be
over-particular as to small details of this nature after you have
learned what it is to go seven days without any kind of 'wash' at
all.</p>

<p>This was the thing that mattered&mdash;sufficient care was not
taken by the authorities to isolate cases of infection or
contagion, so that the unrestricted use of this common
washing-place might&mdash;and in one instance known to the writer
actually did&mdash;endanger the health of all the inmates of the
hospital.</p>

<p>But&mdash;to return to our routine. Breakfast over, and the
lines garnished as aforesaid, the medical officer in charge of the
ward to which you belong goes his rounds. His advent to each tent
is heralded by the sergeant poking his head through the canvas
door-flap and thunderously yelling, "Shunmedcalorfcer!"&mdash;which
use has accustomed you to translate as "Attention! Medical
Officer". So you turn out, and stand with your diet-sheet&mdash;a
mysterious document whereby you obtain varieties of the scanty
rations that are going&mdash;one of a row before the tent. You must
stand there, even if it be only on one leg and a stick. The
sergeant snatches the sheet from your hand, the swift physician
glances keenly at you out of the corner of his eye as he initials
it, does the same for your three companions, and hurriedly passes
on to the next tent, where already the war-cry of his satellite has
preceded him.</p>

<p>The inspection over, there remains naught to do but smoke, if
you have tobacco; read, if you possess any literature; sleep, if
you think you can, or otherwise put in the time until the bugle
sounds the dinner-call. Dinner consists of the same boiled cubes of
leathery meat floating in thick soup and a few potatoes in their
jackets, served up in the little enamelled-tin basins in which you
draw your morning and evening tea.</p>

<p>The long afternoon passes monotonously. The best that you may do
to while away the hours is to sit still in your own or another
tent, and listen to the bloody and hair-raising accounts of
side-lights of the war. Many of them, though couched in simple and
profane language, and not for publication, are true and real beyond
question&mdash;a great many of them are untruly and gloriously
sensational enough for the 'copy' of the most unveracious
correspondent of the average London Daily Shocker.</p>

<p>There was a Cornstalk who came to a marquee in which certain of
us were sitting one rainy afternoon. Most of those present were
Englishmen and Canadians. One little group of four or five sat in a
dark corner, and smoked silently&mdash;content for the most part to
listen to the stirring tales to which, we felt, we could never hope
to approach in interest of adventure and startling detail. Our
compatriot was a member of a certain famous Australian corps, which
had distinguished itself all through the Western Campaign. It would
be unjust to him to say that he was boastful. He was not. He merely
told his tale in a dignified and simple manner that took it
straight to the hearts of his listeners.</p>

<p>The writer had not the good fortune to share in French's dash to
Kimberley. He knows no more about it than what he has been told by
men who were there, and what he has since read in the newspapers,
and magazines, and books. But he is quite sure that he will never
in all his life read such a graphic, nerve-stirring, sympathetic
narration of that great cavalry march as he heard from the
guileless lips of his gifted fellow-countryman that winter
afternoon in the dark interior of the fourth marquee, of the second
row, in the upper football-ground of the Amblers' Club Hospital at
Johannesburg.</p>

<p>It was not merely immense; it was 'epic'. He told us of the
gathering of the host at Ramdam; of the organisation; of the
setting forth; of the fighting near Klip Drift; of the miles of
waterless veldt beyond the Modder. In harrowing manner he recounted
the sufferings the men had endured, the awful thirst that killed
horses by the hundred, the running fight. Clearly and lucidly he
made plain to us the magnificent generalship of Johnny French. We
could not but suppose that, in rare occult fashion, the plans of
that 'deep' customer had been evident to him from the very
beginning of the operations, and that for our benefit&mdash;there,
right there in that humble place&mdash;he was letting us peep along
the quiet backways where the unseen elements of history walk
darkly.</p>

<p>We felt elated and triumphant that we&mdash;we dozen or so of
common soldiery&mdash;should learn these things, first-hand and
hot, from one who knew. It would be something to talk of through
all our uninteresting after-lives. It was a dreadful march, it was
a wonderful march, it was the military movement of the ages; it was
a soul-stirring and ennobling recital, such as we had never looked
to hear from mortal lips. Kinglake might have approached it in
stately minuteness, Archibald Forbes or Steevens could not have
come near it. What a pity, we thought, that he had not lived
before, so that he might have been with Caesar in Gaul, or with
Napoleon from Moscow or across the Alps into Italy!</p>

<p>As though we saw it all, we rode with him into the
shell-battered Diamond City. He showed all the happiness and
sadness of the welcome of the lately besieged. We saw the Kaffirs
ravenously swooping upon the entrails of the worn-out horses shot
at the completion of the march, little white-faced children, and
the anaemic women, coming from the mine-shafts. We saw and heard
Cecil Rhodes; beheld the wonderful gun Labram the American had
built in the De Beers workshops. He took us to the scarred
trenches, the littered Boer redoubts and gun emplacements; and next
morning we went out with him to rout the remaining Boers by
Dronfield. Bill Adams at Waterloo was as a Policeman at a Botany
'push' fight compared to this hero.</p>

<p>And when he stopped, and went away to get tea, a man of his own
corps, who had gaped with us, unseen, from the darkness of that
corner in the marquee, could only gasp brokenly, "Wonderful,
wonderful! Oh, dam wonderful!"</p>

<p>And that expressed the feelings of us all.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued his comrade, "it's the wonderfullest yarn I've
ever heard. Why&mdash;the blarsted liar!&mdash;we went to Kimberley
in Febroory, <i>an' he didn't leave Sydney until April!</i>"</p>

<p>None the less, it was the finest story ever told&mdash;and
although it was sadly true that the narrator had never been to
Kimberley in his life, had never seen the Modder (save at the Glen,
north of Bloemfontein), had never been under fire during the war,
and was 'a consistent and shameless pom-pom dodger' all his
days&mdash;he was gifted with an imagination and power of
expression that Virgil or Dante might have coveted. One had the
inclination, but not the power, to run after him, as he strolled
modestly away, in order to grasp him by the hand and say, "My
brother, you are the most gifted and accomplished liar that
Australia ever produced!" And, when you come to think of it, that
would be saying a great deal.</p>

<p>At night they gave us candles, and we lay upon our stretchers,
smoking and reading, until the time came to 'turn in'; or wondering
whether we were to stay for ever in Johannesburg, and what the town
might be like; or speculating as to how they must be thinking soon
of shearing out at home in Australia. Everything seemed very quiet
out in the soldier-ridden city. One could make out, beyond the top
of the lower fence and through the straight stems of the bordering
eucalypti, the bright globes of incandescent light that shone over
the empty streets. Later, there came the far, faint challenges of
the sentries about the Market Square&mdash;and once, about
midnight, we heard a rifle-shot, and a scream of pain, and, turning
over drowsily, wondered what the poor devil had done.</p>

<p>There was a week of this&mdash;each day exactly a reproduction
of the one before it, no evening that differed from the
last&mdash;and then one mid-day, in the sudden fashion by which
things are carried on on active service, the writer was warned
amongst others to be ready for the train at one o'clock, in order
to start again for Cape Town.</p>

<p>Of the journey down one need not speak at length, although it
was the most exciting train journey the writer has ever taken.
There was never any chance of being bored for lack of interest in
those days between Pretoria and Kroonstadt. Every culvert and
bridge over which we passed seemed to have been blown up, at least
once. The engine that drew our train was bullet-marked about the
cab and boiler; the closed trucks in which we travelled nearly all
had little round holes somewhere through their walls. The first
night we stayed at Vereeniging, just beside the Vaal, and waited
there until morning.</p>

<p>When we had crossed the river, and come to Viljoen's Drift upon
the southern side, news came that the line had been again
interrupted further down. It was noon before we recommenced our
journey, and by the next evening we had not come to Honing Spruit.
We had passed the Kopjes Siding where De Wet had nearly caught Lord
Kitchener in person; and Roodeval where he had unmistakably caught
the Fourth Derbyshires, and had blotted out everything of the
station save one shell-torn iron tank and a steel safe, and where
the mails and winter clothing lay half-burned over acres of
veldt.</p>

<p>Honing Spruit was but eighteen miles from Kroonstad, but no
train ever travelled in the darkness over that part of the new
colony. So we waited beside the little entrenched station, and
about eight o'clock were turned out of the trucks into the trenches
to assist in repelling an expected Boer attack, which, however,
never came off.</p>

<p>At Honing Spruit there was a quaint but doubtful story of a
stray Canadian, who, somehow, was somewhere along the line with
various other details in a little entrenched post, guarding
communications. It was his duty to ride out each morning along a
length of line, in order to find out whether all was clear for the
trains to proceed. One morning, having sallied forth as usual, at
some distance out he espied five industrious beings busily employed
in levering up a rail. They were so intent upon the work in hand
that they did not perceive their avenging Nemesis, and he was able
to approach them within two hundred yards of the scene of their
exertions, still unnoticed. At first, he thought of riding back and
reporting his discovery in the orthodox way, but being a Canadian,
and therefore dowered with a delightful freedom from all the
restraining trammels of Red-Book rules, he decided 'to score off
his own bat'. So he dismounted, tied his horse to a telegraph-pole,
rested his rifle over an ant-heap, took careful aim, and shot a
Boer. As the startled men sprang to their feet in astonishment he
shot another, and, whilst they were hurriedly seeking to mount
their horses, he 'bagged' a third. The remaining two escaped.</p>

<p>The Canadian strolled over to the three bodies, and found each
one of them quite dead. Doubting whether his comrades at the post
would believe his unsupported story of having singly engaged five
Boers, killing three, and putting the other two to flight,
he&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;<i>he took their scalps!</i></p>

<p>We reached Kroonstad for breakfast, remained there until nearly
noon, and arrived at Brandfort in the evening. On the railway
bridge near the latter town, a sentry had recently been 'sniped' by
some enterprising sportsman, from the bed of the river, on a
moonlight night. Accordingly, nowadays, the more representative
burghers of Brandfort paraded with the guard on the bridge, and
took turns of 'sentry-go' in military overcoats. There had been no
more 'sniping'.</p>

<p>Bloemfontein we came to in the 'wee sma' hours of the next day,
and were immediately taken from our trucks, given a drink of hot
milk and bovril, and placed in the bell-tents of the big canvas
hospital under the long kopje where were mounted the Naval guns,
and which since the British occupation has been known as Naval
Hill. And next day, as a further stage of our progress to the
coast, we were drafted off in batches to the various hospitals
about the town and its vicinity.</p>

<p>One has written at greater length of hospital experiences than
at first intended, but, as they would be incomplete without some
account of the five weary weeks at Bloemfontein, we shall speak of
the great hospital in the veldt, westward of the town, whither we
were sent, in another chapter.</p>

<p>Moreover, the writer had opportunity of seeing, as it were, the
Military Hospitals in three very representative stages. First there
were the primitive arrangements, typical of the extreme Front, at
Pretoria, where you slept in stables and fed like pigs. Then came
the Amblers' Club, which was a sort of intermediate stage between
inferiority and tolerability. Thirdly, we come to Number 'N'
General, at Bloemfontein, which, at the time when we were inmates
of it, was a good type of the Stationary Hospital, so located that
every necessary thing might easily be procured; and which,
therefore, had to stand or fall in one's estimation upon its own
merits, and could shelter behind no excuse of interrupted
communication&mdash;for then, and for many months, the lines to
Port Elizabeth and Cape Town were both open to traffic, and
supplies were coming through regularly, and in sufficiently large
quantities to meet all requirements.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI - THE HOSPITAL
(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>

<p>Number 'N' General Hospital stood to the west of Bloemfontein,
on the rising veldt that stretched away to Kimberley. You came out
past the white-columned Raadzaal, through the bushes that fringed
the outskirts of the town, kept northward of the great clump of
willow trees that had been so cool and shady when we came
before&mdash;but were bare and leafless now&mdash;crossed a deep
spruit, and arrived at the wide-spreading city of snowy canvas. On
the higher skyline were redoubts and trenches, infantry and
artillery camps, and, standing up clean and sharply-cut against the
bluest of all blue skies, the gloriously purple, far-off peaks of
conical and sugar-loaf kopjes&mdash;miles, and miles, and ever so
many miles away through the clear, dry, closer-bringing
atmosphere.</p>

<p>And if you stood, ere you entered the lines and streets of
gleaming tents&mdash;stood just on the threshold of the suburbs of
that strangely-peopled city&mdash;and looked back across the
intervening veldt, your eye took in a picture of such sunlit
beauty, such clear and smiling sweetness of earth, and sky, and
distant glowing hills, as you will never in all your 'afterwards'
remember but with pleasure and delight.</p>

<p>Across a mile or more of bare, brown veldt the buildings of
brick, and stone, and iron nestled in their beds of evergreen
eucalyptus and leafless oak and elm. Spires, and walls, and
gleaming iron roofs studded the deep-green and gold-grey beauty of
their lovely setting. The dome above the Raadzaal, the steeple of
the Dutch Church, the floating Union Jack over the Presidency,
lingered in one's vision beside the rest. At one end the old fort
rose above the clustering roofs on its little kopje, at the other
there stretched away from us to eastward the long, flat bulk of
Naval Hill. Away behind, forty miles away, yet clear and sharply
showing in every curve of outline, lay blue Thaba N'chu&mdash;the
great historic mountain of the brave old Voortrekkers. Down to
southward, in the rolling ridges, were the little groups of shining
distant tents that marked the outposts in the wide perimeter of
possible defence. Between them and us, beside the road that had led
in the march from Driefontein, was the great Rest Camp&mdash;a
bewildering massing together of bell-tents.</p>

<p>If you have gazed long enough across the open to beautiful
Bloemfontein, and have drunk in all the loveliness of scene we used
to sit and watch through many afternoons for hours unweariedly, it
will be worth your while to turn and look at what is close to
you&mdash;the trim orderliness, and clean regularity, and manifest
respectability of Number 'N'.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful place, a kind of new world of weird beings in
bright new clothes, and spurred and booted surgeons who never rode
a horse&mdash;and, above all, it is the kingdom of 'Mad Jack'.</p>

<p>There were streets and lanes of stately marquee tents&mdash;one
great group upon the right hand, and another upon the left, and, in
between, an open space with galvanised-iron huts for stores, and
kitchens, and washing-places. In the background there were acres of
bell-tents&mdash;tenantless now, but once upon a time (which the
orderlies speak of yet shudderingly as 'the fever time') full to
overflowing.</p>

<p>Each marquee is dressed in its line, correct and level to the
quarter of an inch. Every guy-rope is uniform and symmetrical with
regard to every other, every peg is driven into the ground at the
same angle as every other peg, and all are whitewashed. Along each
broad highway are whitened stones, set evenly in rows upon the
ground, and, at the corners, little heaps of boulders, also of a
glowing whiteness.</p>

<p>There is nothing here that stands out from its surroundings. All
is uniformity and monotony of sameness. The patients are dressed
with an exact similarity&mdash;blue flannel trousers, ill-fitting
flannel jackets of the same vivid hue, red neckties, and yellow
slippers; and each man blows his nose upon a red cotton
handkerchief with a white border. The orderlies are all in khaki
serge, the officers in uniform, with puttees or leggings, and
sometimes spurs. The Nursing Sisters glide from tent to tent, in
their neat grey gowns with the red capes about their shoulders, and
white muslin headdress&mdash;pleasant to behold, and generally
pleasant to speak to and be nursed by, and always, one thinks,
good, brave gentlewomen.</p>

<p>In our marquee there were five Tommies and the writer. There was
a private of the West Riding who had been a
colour-sergeant&mdash;but was 'smashed'&mdash;suffering from
rheumatism, and so bad that he was unable to bear the coldness of
sheets upon his bed. Next to him, one of the Scots Guards, badly
wounded in the groin. Then a Fourteenth Hussar, who said his heart
was weak. It was&mdash;but not in the way he sought to impress the
doctor with. Beside him lay a little lance-corporal of the Essex
Regiment, whose trouble was synovitis of the right knee. Opposite
the writer's bed was that of a broken-jawed private of the
Oxfordshire Light Infantry. The writer was the only un-English
resident, and, being an Australian, was a person of some
consequence in the community.</p>

<p>Comparatively all the appointments of the marquee were on a
scale of unexampled luxury. There was a tarpaulin on the earthen
floor by way of carpet. We slept on beds&mdash;real iron beds with
spring mattresses and sheets&mdash;think of it&mdash;sheets! There
were counterpanes, too, and pillows with pillow-cases, and they
were changed as soon as ever they began to get dirty; and we had
night-shirts, and day shirts, and all manner of fine things. There
were little bedside tables for each man, and there was a bigger
table by the door of the tent with a looking-glass on it, and
plates, and knives and forks, and enamelled bowls to drink from.
And we had an orderly to attend on us&mdash;(only he didn't, he got
us to attend on him)&mdash;and we were quite suddenly become as
millionnaires and princes, who have everything they want and a good
deal they don't want&mdash;which we had too.</p>

<p>But a bed&mdash;a real bed&mdash;just think of it! You may laugh
if you like, you who read this enthusiastic boastfulness of beds,
but just you sleep upon the bare ground under the stars, wet and
dry, every night for seven months, and when you get into a bed
again&mdash;a real, soft, comfortable bed&mdash;you will never want
to leave it. The good Captain B&mdash;&mdash;, who visited ours and
two other marquees, felt the writer's ankle, and put it into
plaster-of-Paris, and sent him to bed for three weeks, and the
writer knew himself that, if it had been for three years, he would
have borne it cheerfully. My goodness! but it was fine. The luxury
of it!</p>

<p>And so, for those restful weeks one was in bed, and there were
opportunities afforded Tommy Cornstalk of studying Tommy Atkins at
close quarters, such as he had not had before&mdash;and the little
Sister, and Mad Jack, and Keen the Orderly, and the Boy Chaplain,
who served out funny little prayer-books with swords, and guns, and
lances printed on their covers&mdash;and all the other variously
interesting types of humanity who moved about the hospital.</p>

<p>It was a curiously interesting experience. It would be just as
interesting to an inmate of a pauper asylum or a gaol. One found
new types of men, of whose existence one had merely read before.
There were tales of strange lives and of a different world to the
one we knew of in Australia. There was the quaintest profanity in
language, the most singular and notable slang to be met with
outside the chronicles of Mulvaney and his allies. There were
anecdotes of life in barrack-room such as we would not repeat to a
Chinaman; there were stories of garrison towns that would shock
Beelzebub. Robbery and rape were homely topics amongst those
delightful army types. Getting drunk was never such a glorified
feat as one heard it spoken of in Number 'N'. One has lived and
worked with all manner of outcast men to whom obscenity was wit and
blasphemy the salt of conversation, but never has one, or never
will again, perhaps, encounter such strange gifts of foul-mouthed
loquacity as one lived through in that five weeks at
Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;one never will meet again five kindlier souls, or
more generous, or better disposed, or more unselfishly ready to
assist a helpless comrade. One may never forget the quiet little
helping ways they had, whilst one lay in bed unable to assist
oneself. The red-headed Guardsman, who was the foulest souled of
all, swept the floor about one's bed in the mornings, or walked
painfully to the reading tent and brought back books, out of sheer
good-heartedness. The little Dublin guttersnipe who graced the
Essex mended one's trousers, and refused so much as half a fig of
black tobacco by way of repayment for his trouble. And they were
all just as kind and helpful to one another. Sampson, who talked
with difficulty by reason of his bandaged jaw, moved silently about
the tent doing perpetual little jobs of tidiness. They were the
tidiest men in the world. But most soldiers of the regular army are
that. Imagine the same class in a shearer's hut!</p>

<p>The day commenced with the arrival of Keen from his quarters.
Keen was a Cockney-Scotchman&mdash;at least, that is how West
Riding described him. He was always desirous of buying things from
you, which he would sell to some one else at a higher figure. "Yah!
blinded, bloomin' Sheeny&mdash;vat you dinks!"&mdash;he of the
Guards would remark by way of 'riling' him. The Hussar sold him a
coloured blanket&mdash;the cheap sort you may purchase anywhere for
a few shillings, and the design upon which was a most startling
combination of all the cardinal colours. Keen traded it to the
little Sister as having come from Cronje's laager. The amount of
stuff which Cronje must have had stored in that laager was simply
enormous. You certainly never buy any Boer curios or relics except
upon the understanding that it was salvaged from Paardeberg. It
cannot be genuine otherwise.</p>

<p>Shortly after the coming of Keen, a man brings the day's
allowance of bread&mdash;a very liberal one here. Nobody gets up
much before breakfast-time. A bucket of water and basin are the
means of toilets. The buckets are beautifully clean and polished in
Number 'N'.</p>

<p>One pot of jam was given to us each day, and one ounce of butter
for every man. Besides these delicacies there were, as 'extras,' a
tin of cocoa paste, two pineapples, twelve oranges, four bottles of
stout, and two ounces of whisky in common amongst the tentful. The
broken jaw and the 'rheumatism,' also, had special diets of their
own.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast those who were able to move about
assisted Keen in sweeping out the tent, making the beds, and
generally cleaning and polishing all the plates and utensils in
use, so that everything might be neat and 'shipshape' against the
coming of the Doctor at ten o'clock. If the weather were fine, the
canvas sides of the marquee were looped up all round, so that the
air might circulate freely and keep the atmosphere of the tent
fresh and sweet.</p>

<p>Just before the advent of the Doctor, the little Sister who had
charge of the row of marquees in which ours stood came to see that
all was right. If it wasn't she bullied Keen unmercifully. It was
almost ludicrous to see the compact little woman, with the firm
chin and tender eyes, ordering about great, hulking men who could
have carried her in their pockets, so to speak. She always had her
way&mdash;which, however, is not unusual with her sex. She, too,
was Scotch, but her speech was much prettier than Keen's.</p>

<p>When the Doctor came we all lay in, or upon, our beds with our
board-mounted diet-sheets in our hands, and he took a lot of
cheerful trouble over each of us, and was civil, and witty, and
alert&mdash;much more alert than the Hussar desirous of
heart-disease supposed. Every one liked Captain B&mdash;&mdash;. He
was not a regular R.A.M.C. man, but belonged to some volunteer
medical corps in London, and had a good practice privately, Keen
said. Keen knew everything.</p>

<p>'Extras' were drawn from the Quartermaster's stores at eleven
o'clock, and we drank the drinks immediately&mdash;by way of
diversion&mdash;and kept the fruit until the afternoon. The cocoa
paste was made use of after dinner and at night, making a couple of
bowls apiece, with hot water from the cookhouse, which Oxfordshire
procured by reason of possessing a 'towny' amongst the cooks. We
lived well in our marquee, principally owing to the pushing ways of
Keen&mdash;who levied commission on all he obtained for
us&mdash;and the kindness of Captain B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Dinner was mainly 'roast varied'&mdash;which is meat, gravy,
vegetables, salt, mustard and pepper, in a little flat tin. The
tins were carried from the cookhouse in a hot-water tray, so that
they kept warm.</p>

<p>The afternoon was a time of sleep, of lurid conversation, or
reading, or draughts, or chess, or dominoes, or cards. At four
o'clock little niggers came through the lines selling the
Bloemfontein <i>Post</i>, which we always bought. There was little enough
of news in it, and its leaders were obviously inspired, but there
was occupation and interest in trying to read the Dutch pages, and
any news was better than none. Its telegraphic items relative to
the war were probably much more reliable than those of the big
papers in England and Australia at the time, but they were usually
many days old. The <i>Post</i> was the successor of the <i>Friend</i>, which had
been a so bitterly anti-English journal before the British
occupation, and a so brilliantly edited news-letter for the few
weeks immediately after that event, when it was under the control
of the war correspondents.</p>

<p>Tea was at four-thirty, and sleep came about nine o'clock. Every
day was as the one described. They never varied to a quarter of an
hour. You ate the same thing and did the same thing every day as
you had done yesterday and the day before, and, after a week of it,
the monotony of existence was unspeakable. One seemed to have
become a machine. After the activity of life at the front, the lack
of exercise and change was the most trying experience of all the
war. At times it affected men's spirits strangely, and one has
heard of cases of melancholia arising from the enforced idleness of
hospitals coming in so sudden contrast to a mental state that
pulsated with interest and excitement.</p>

<p>One must make further mention of 'Mad Jack'. To speak of Number
'N' and pass that worthy over would be as though one told of the
sea and ignored the fact that its fundamental element was water.
'Mad Jack' was the fundamental element of Number 'N'. He had the
sending of patients to Capetown, and as most men wished to get to
Capetown, if only for a change, most men came into contact with
him, and most men wished subsequently that they had rather come in
contact with the Evil One himself. It was amusing, but disastrous
to your chances of a trip down country, to go before 'Mad Jack,'
and let him see what your inclinations were.</p>

<p>He was in charge of a large part of the hospital, and held army
rank as a Lieutenant-Colonel, and was a most curious and
interesting character. Short, wiry, slightly knock-kneed, with legs
very much shorter than his long, flat-backed body, and dressed in a
khaki uniform that did not fit him well, and with leggings some
sizes too large for his calves, he was a strange figure as he stood
outside his office-tent making fiery speech to the luckless patient
or orderly who might have chanced to incur his wrath. A keen,
square-jawed, sun-tanned face peered at you through gold glasses,
as though he sought to probe your very soul with his choleric gaze.
Popular report credited him with having been in the Army Medical
Service for more years than most of us could count to our ages. He
had been previously in Africa in '81, in India, in Malta&mdash;in
all, or nearly all, the many places where British soldiers go.</p>

<p>But it was of Ireland of which he seemed to wish you always to
bear in mind that he was a son. Should it happen that you were
Irish also&mdash;Cork for preference&mdash;then, indeed, was your
bed a bed of roses and your path an easy one. They said that he had
done good work down about Colesberg in the early year, and that he
had been mentioned in despatches for conspicuous gallantry. And
they told all manner of stories about him&mdash;his sayings became
proverbs, his quaint wit and quainter wrath subjects of laughing
talk in the marquees at night. No one who has sojourned in Number
'N' can possibly forget 'Mad Jack'.</p>

<p>A civil surgeon, doing duty at the hospital, had, at his own
request, sent a certain man before him whom he (the civil surgeon)
had recommended for Capetown.</p>

<p>"Phwat ails ye, me man&mdash;phwat ails ye, phwat ails ye? Can
ye not sphake&mdash;what, what, what!"</p>

<p>"You told me to come and see you, sir, and Mr.
S&mdash;&mdash;sent me up this morning." "Shtand up sthraight, ye
scoundthrel&mdash;shtand up sthraight in y'r boots! I didn't tell
ye anything av the sort&mdash;what, what, what!"</p>

<p>"But, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shtop y'r 'buts,' me man. I tould ye nothing av the koind. Kape
shtill, now! Phwat d'ye mane by comin' here thryin' to tell me I
said such nonsinse? I niver said it!"</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel D&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now phwat d'ye mane by y'r insubordination? I'll get ye two
years, me man. Phwat ails ye, I tell ye? For why do ye not answer
me? Is it dumb ye are? Come here&mdash;come here into the loight,
till I look phwat koind av a man ye are, at all. Why don't ye tell
me phwat's the matter wid ye? What, what, what!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've had enteric, and the Doc&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye've had no such thing at all. Phwat d'ye know about enteric?
Who tould ye ye'd had enteric. Ye've not! Ye got a bullet now,
didn't ye? What!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but I had enteric after in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twas a bullet, ye Irishman! Phwat soort of an elephint ye must
be not to know the difference betwane a gunshot wound an' faver?
D'ye want to go to Kep Town? Now shpake the truth, me man.
Do-ye-want-to-go-to-Kep-Town? What, what, what!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'd like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, ye won't! Ye'll not go to Kep Town! Rist Camp, Rist Camp,
Rist Camp! Mark him 'Rist Camp,' sargint. Sure ye're just the bhoyo
for th' Rist Camp!" "But, sir, I'm feeling very weak,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wake, is it? Ye fale wake. Ye don't, ye don't, ye know well ye
don't! Go along wid ye, me man&mdash;isn't it the tickey beer in
Kep Town an' the Dutch gurls ye're thinkin' of? What! Look here, me
lad, ye were never so well off in yer loife as ye'll be in the Rist
Camp. Sure, the Colonel 'll thrate ye loike his own son. Aw, yis,
ye'll go to th' Rist Camp. Sure, it's a grand place entirely. Kep
Town!&mdash;Kep Town!&mdash;what, what, what! Now, I'll just tell
ye what, me bhoyo&mdash;a fortnight in the Rist Camp an' two years
in China 'll jist put ye roight. Ye'll be a new man afther
it&mdash;what, what, what!"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it!&mdash;won't you let me speak?"</p>

<p>"Phwat's that, phwat's that? Who are ye, who are ye? Phwat d'ye
mane be comin' here shwearin' an' cur-rsin' loike that? Who are ye,
who are ye? Phwat rigimint do ye belong to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Second New Zealand Contingent."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;these dam Colonials! Mark him 'Kep Town,'
sargint&mdash;get out, get out o' me soight! Sure, I get no pace at
all wid you Austhralians, an' Canad'yan's, an' New Zealanders! Go
on&mdash;get away off to y'r marquee! Y're not fit t' thravel! Mark
him 'further tratement,' sargint. Alright, alright&mdash;go away!
Go away&mdash;out o'&mdash;me soight. Aw, yes, yes, yes! Ye'll go
to Kep Town&mdash;anywhare t' get rid av ye!"</p>

<p>The above is only a sample of the style and manner of this
quaint creature. He strolled about the Camp, stopping and
questioning men on all kinds of astonishing subjects. He was,
without doubt, the greatest feature of Number 'N'. An encounter
with 'Mad Jack' kept you laughing to yourself for twenty-four
hours. No one could ever forget him.</p>

<p>But under the quaint, eccentric manner and the quizzical fury of
his denunciation there beat a good heart, and he was, in his own
way, a kindly, honest gentleman enough. He may have been a singular
curiosity, but he was a rough diamond also.</p>

<p>Sometimes, at night, neighbours would drop into your marquee.
And there had come one who was a 'bleeder'&mdash;at any rate that
is what he of the Fourteenth said of him. It seemed to be a pet
name for a typical low-class Londoner&mdash;a slum-dragger, one of
the very much 'submerged tenth'.</p>

<p>There were other Hospitals down the line&mdash;there were
Wynberg and Woodstock, for example. But has not the voice of the
M.P. been raised in the land, and has he not told you all about
them from the fulness of his knowledge and vastness of his
experience? And when you are told a thing isn't it wise to believe
it always&mdash;if you want to? There was, too, the wonderfully
perfect ambulance train that bore us Capewards, but if you wish to
become learned as to ambulance trains read "With Number
Three".[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Rudyard Kipling.]</p>

<p>Personally, after the lapse of months, one has dreary memories
of life in hospital; but it was very much better than one had
expected it to be.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII - THE MAN</h2>

<p>It was a hot morning in the veldt, somewhere between Abraham's
Kraal and Aasvogel Kop, in what was, as yet, the Orange Free State.
We cooked a pumpkin beside a ransacked farmhouse, and felt bitterly
resentful of the fact that a belted Staff Officer was chasing a
fowl in the background with a drawn sword, and were fiendishly
delighted when he tripped over an old wheelbarrow, and got his
well-fitting khaki clothes lamentably dusty. He saw us laughing,
and looked very angry, and then laughed himself and went inside,
leaving the hen to whom she might concern. We were too weakly
hungry to be concerned about her.</p>

<p>The mirage shone in the valley, and swallowed up a train of
transport-waggons slowly lumbering out of the haze behind. Mile
after mile the long procession had staggered by, the cries of the
Kaffir drivers came shrilly to us through the clear morning, the
cracking of their whips sounded like far-off rifle-shots. A low
cloud of reddish dust floated into the blue sky beside the line of
march, stragglers drifted past on foot and horseback&mdash;weary,
boot-worn, mulish, patient Tommies, whose rifles seemed to weigh
them down; sweating, cursing, disgusted 'flash' colonials leading
lame horses; sickly boys belonging to Cape regiments, whose
worn-out 'chargers' had given in at last and were dead
behind&mdash;all the strangely assorted flotsam and jetsam that
struggles wearily and perfunctorily to keep pace with an army
marching forced marches.</p>

<p>They were hungry days those&mdash;when the army left its base by
Modder Bridge, and dived suddenly through the enemy's country in a
swift dash for his capital. They were exciting, eventful days.
Osfontein had been followed by Driefontein; Driefontein was to be
sequelled by the siege and surrender of Bloemfontein. The great
battle for which we all looked, but which did not come, was still
looming in front of us. Each day brought us closer to what, we
thought, was to be the bloodiest struggle of the war. When, three
mornings after, we left the regiment upon the Cape-Pretoria
railway, and, scouting forward in the uncertain dusk of dawn, from
the top of a low ridge beheld the pretty town below us, heard the
homely crowing of cocks, and saw the peaceful blue smoke ascending
from beneath the early morning coffee-pot, we hardly could believe
our eyes. The great final struggle, from which we were to emerge
conquerors of all South Africa, and which was to bring Paul Kruger
suing hastily for peace, had again eluded us&mdash;but here, two
days before the expected fight, we watched divisions and brigades
and guns and teams go past, and cursed fervently the luck that had
lamed our horses, and left us, rationless and forlorn, in the
tracks of the advance.</p>

<p>My friend was of Roberts' Horse&mdash;a full-bearded,
tweed-trousered Victorian&mdash;for all the world like a Boer, and
having nothing soldierly in his make-up, save a worn and faded
khaki tunic, a bandolier, a slung rifle, and a straight back. We
had foregathered earlier, in a mealie field, and quarrelled over
the possession of a pumpkin; but a compromise had established
amicable relations, and, at noon, we roasted the heaven-sent
vegetable in a fire of shelled mealiecobs, beside that
white-washed, abandoned farmhouse.</p>

<p>In the house we had foraged unsuccessfully for food, but
everything seemed to have been removed, or destroyed, by its recent
tenants. In a barn was a great heap of unthreshed Kaffir corn, but
some one had thoughtfully anticipated the coming of hungry
rooibaajes by emptying over it a drum of tar.</p>

<p>Upon the stoep without lay an old book&mdash;a Dutch Bible,
clumsily bound in leather, printed in curious ancient type, and
bearing upon its title-page the date sixteen hundred and eighty
something in Roman numerals&mdash;a veritable treasure and
priceless relic for any book lover. In the front was written in
faded yellow characters "Gert van somebody," and a few lines of
Scripture. In the back cover was a long list of family names, with
dates that ranged from 1690 to the end of the seventeenth
century&mdash;a kind of genealogical tree. Poor people&mdash;their
terror-stricken flight had been so hurried and hasty that, though
they had taken everything beside, they had left what was probably
their most beloved heirloom to the spoiler&mdash;the accursed bogey
of a rooinek, who might have helped them to load it up also, had
they only waited.</p>

<p>The Bible was carried in the writer's haversack for three long
hours, and it was large and heavy. Then Providence sent another
pumpkin into his path, and, there being but room for either food or
Gospel, Gospel had to be left in the veldt, and food transported to
the camping-ground in place of it. We were very hungry&mdash;but
now that that hunger is a memory and not a stern reality, regret
has taken its place. You never know what manner of a depraved
creature you may become until you <i>are</i> really hungry.</p>

<p>As we stood beside our miserable fire eyeing the blackening
slices of pumpkin with starving impatience there came another great
Staff Officer, trotting hideously, to whom spake the hunter of
fowls, emerging from the house. We caught faintly the words
"Commander-in-Chief" and "coming," and in reply&mdash;"No; next
house&mdash;lunch is ready there," and he of the misshapen
riding-trousers trotted back again&mdash;a moving eyesore as he
bumped upon his uneven way.</p>

<p>And soon after, down from behind the stone cattle-kraal to our
left, a group of Staff Officers rode at a walk. Behind them came a
body-guard of bearded Cape Colonists and Uitlanders. At their head
rode a little old man.</p>

<p>He was just as he looks in the portraits that have overrun all
the papers of the last two years, and was quite the kind of man one
had expected to behold, except in this one particular&mdash;that he
was even more diminutive than we had expected him to prove. In the
Headquarters Staff there were many big men, and this fact may
possibly have emphasised the smallness of his stature, but by
himself, or in a crowd, he can never be anything else, so far as
physical development goes, than 'little Bobs'.</p>

<p>It was a never-to-be-forgotten morning for the writer&mdash;that
of the 11th of March, 1900. It was one of those rare times to an
Australian when the lump of enthusiasm comes up into your throat,
and you can say nothing, and think of nothing, and do
nothing&mdash;only <i>feel</i>. It seemed impossible to realise that one
was really gazing upon one of the idols of one's boyhood, and that,
unlike most idols, this one had not proved to have 'feet of clay'.
One thought hurriedly and vaguely of the homesick boy going out to
join the Bengal Artillery, years and years ago; of the footnote
below his own modest telling of the gallant deed that won him the
V.C.; of the Siege of Delhi; of the Kashmir Gate; of John
Nicholson; of Cabul and Khandahar; of the dead son lying in Natal;
of Paardeberg, of Osfontein, of yesterday&mdash;of everything about
him that could flash through one's mind in half a second.</p>

<p>He barely halted to say a word or two, inaudible to us, to the
fowl-hunting Staff Officer, who had mounted his horse and was
awaiting the arrival of the Staff before they came&mdash;and then
he moved on, speaking earnestly to a handsome younger man who rode
beside him.</p>

<p>"Who's that crowd?" laconically inquired the Victorian. "Who's
the ole feller?" Ignorant swine!</p>

<p>There was little time in which to notice very much before they
had come, and passed by, and were out of sight upon the other side
of the farmhouse&mdash;but one impression, stronger than all
others, remains. Of all the Staff he was the freshest and most
active-looking by a very great deal. It was not hard to realise
that, since the Army had left the camp by Osfontein, it had been a
time of great strain and long hours for all of them. The tired,
weary figures, sitting their horses stiffly, spoke eloquently
enough of the state of being of the Staff as a whole. But the
little man at their head rode as a 'flash' shearer who has just
'rung out' a shed&mdash;alert, springy, vigorous, and very fit.
Excuse the comparison, you who know flash shearers. It merely
refers to deportment.</p>

<p>One has written of him above as a 'little old man'. 'Old' he
is&mdash;one knows it; and 'little'&mdash;one has seen it. But he
is the youngest old man you might come across in a thousand years.
His figure is slim, and straight, and active. The scrupulously neat
khaki uniform fitted him as a glove. The puttee leggings encased
the trimmest little legs that ever pressed against
stirrup-leathers. His brick-red face had been fresh shaven that
morning&mdash;one would swear. His was the most graceful form you
might ever chance to behold, and he carried himself so bravely, and
modestly, and handsomely, that one felt as though some old knight
had stepped from a bygone century into this, endowed with all the
best attributes of the 'age of chivalry'. It came across one's
thought that here, indeed, was a man of whom it might be said
again&mdash;'<i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>'.</p>

<p>He went on, and, full of pumpkin, we, too, went on later in the
day; and, in course of time, he led a procession of Guards and
other tattered foot soldiers through Bloemfontein, whilst we camped
five miles outside, at Wessels' Farm.</p>

<p>The next occasion of the writer seeing the 'great little man'
was in the Market Square of Bloemfontein as he walked across on
foot towards the Club, attended by the beetle-browed Kitchener, and
two less important personages who followed a little way behind.</p>

<p>One could not but comment upon the striking contrast presented
by the appearance of the two great soldiers&mdash;a contrast which
is not only of appearance, but of every deed and the manner of its
doing. They were both great men&mdash;one had but to see them to
recognise that fact. Even had one never heard of them before it
would have been apparent at a glance. But between the stern,
relentless, sphinx-like countenance of Kitchener and the kindly
humanity that looks from behind the features of Lord Roberts there
is a great difference. Only in one characteristic is it possible to
compare the two faces&mdash;and that is the indefinable something
that spells 'success,' the strong, steady, sure look that speaks
most eloquently of great mental power, of unswerving purpose, of a
will before which other wills must bend or break.</p>

<p>In physique every one knows how greatly they differ. Kitchener
is a big man, even amongst big men; Lord Roberts is a little man
amongst little men. But each of them, according to the scale of his
construction, is a splendid specimen of vigorous manhood. The one
is comparatively young, straight-formed, sure of step, and long of
limb; the other is very old for an active General, and short of
limb&mdash;so short that were Kitchener to walk with his usual
stride, 'Bobs,' one thinks, would need to trot, in order to keep
pace. But he is just as straight, just as erect, just as
imperiously commanding in his looks. Both of them are men of
steel.</p>

<p>In course of conversation with an engine-driver on the railway
between Kroonstad and the Transvaal capital, the manner of the two
men was strikingly exemplified by his words.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "Bobs an' Kitchener comes along sometimes.
My colonial, y' oughter see the difference at the stations, though!
W'en 'Bobs's' train pulls up, he gets out an' strolls along the
platform, an' everybody knocks off work so's to come up an' have a
look at him. He jes' walks about among the crowd, talkin' to 'em
like me an' you would. Asks 'em how they're gettin' on for rations,
an' so on. 'Course, he's never familiar, or anything like
that&mdash;y' can always see he's Boss&mdash;an' if he notices
anything wrong he lets 'em know, quick an' lively&mdash;but he
seems to be more of a friend to everybody than anything else. But
w'en 'Herbert' steps out of his carriage there's hardly a soul to
be seen on the platform&mdash;they're all away diggin' trenches, or
mountin' guns, or scoutin' roun' the country&mdash;any blessed
thing, so long as he can see 'em workin'. Lord help 'em if they
ain't! W'y I b'lieve if Kitchener was to be given command of
heaven's gates he'd jes' as soon Stellenbosch Peter, spite of all
his long service, supposin' he caught him nappin' any warm
afternoon!"</p>

<p>On another afternoon, we had been up Maitland Street to where,
it was said, a baker baked bread in a little lane that opened from
it. We had found the place, and there had been a clamouring queue
of Tommies from all the world, so that it seemed one might wait
indefinitely on the 'off' chance of a loaf of hot bread, and the
possibly full chance of getting none. So we had come away mourning,
and were leisurely walking down the street on the right-hand side
as you come towards the Post Office, when we noticed a throng of
officers, and tattered privates, and sweating Dutch civilians
seeking entrance to the Town House.</p>

<p>"What's on inside?" we asked a military policeman near the
door.</p>

<p>"Dunno," he replied, with the customary ignorance of the British
soldier as to what may proceed beneath his nose. "Dunno. Specs it's
a meetin' o' they blarsted Christians."</p>

<p>We went in. Even should they prove to be 'blarsted Christians'
we were anxious to see what they were about. It was long since we
had sat for an hour beneath the roof of a public hall or place of
entertainment. It would be almost refreshing not to feel the
blueness of the sky overhead for a little while. And so we
entered&mdash;there were difficulties about doing so. We had to
squeeze in through the throng, heedless of protest; and, finally,
we stood against the wall under the gallery of a large hall. At the
further end was a stage. In the midst of a setting of scene that
might have stood for Dunsinane Wood, or the Forest of Arden, or
Eugowra Rocks in <i>Robbery under Arms</i>, was a little table with a
water-bottle upon it, and a little man&mdash;<i>the</i> Little
Man&mdash;beside it.</p>

<p>All the hushed audience strained its melting faces towards the
stage. There was a greasy smell of perspiring men, of new bread, of
tobacco-laden breaths. Clumsy feet sometimes shuffled on the floor.
But, though the hall was packed as tightly as it might be with
hotly living soldiery, there was a hushed, exciting silence of the
kind you only find when there speaks publicly to a great gathering
some one whose most trivial word the gathering does not wish to
lose, whom it is worth their while to listen to, and who knows what
he is talking about.</p>

<p>He was speaking. We stood upon tip-toes to see him, and strained
also so that we might not miss any word he said.</p>

<p>It was a meeting of the Army Temperance
Association&mdash;apparently organised by the big-bearded chaplain
who sat upon his right hand, and who also subsequently said
something that was not interesting&mdash;and of which, we learned
for the first time that afternoon, Lord Roberts was the
President.</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, and distinctly, and to the point&mdash;he was
like a little Maxim, tapping out its emphatic arguments rapidly,
unmistakably. There was nothing of the 'Great-I-am' or the
'this-is-so-because-I-say-it' style of oratory about his speech. It
was direct, conclusive, and to the point; and he spoke as one grown
man speaks to another. He was not to us, that afternoon, the
Commander-in-Chief, telling us what we <i>must</i> do&mdash;he was simply
our friend 'Bobs' suggesting, in all kindliness, what we <i>should</i>
do.</p>

<p>He spoke of the march up the Modder. It seemed that it was a
greater one than the march to Khandahar. He enlarged upon the
privations the troops had had to endure, the footsoreness, the
weariness, the difficulties of Driefontein. He said how sorry he
had been when it was wet, and what a fine thing it was that we had
been unable to get drunk. (Well, it possibly was a fine thing.)</p>

<p>He said he had never led such an army as ours, and that he very
much doubted whether any one else had done so either. We marched
well, we fought well, above all we behaved ourselves well. Under
the clear-cut eloquence of the little man we almost managed to
believe that we were models of good behaviour. We felt glad that he
did not seem to have realised how very dearly we would have liked
to loot Bloemfontein, how much we would have enjoyed but half a day
of the swashbuckling license that other armies had enjoyed in other
wars. We felt sneakingly glad that he had such a good opinion of
us. We almost realised what 'whited sepulchres' feel like.</p>

<p>But when he went on to enlarge upon the sobriety and steadiness
we displayed in the streets of the conquered Free State capital,
the absence of crime, and the lack of defaulters, and attributed it
all to the temperance principles that actuated the army, we
wondered whether, possessing as he did all the elements that go to
make a good man, he really lacked in what has been spoken of as the
'saving grace of humour'.</p>

<p>For this was the state of affairs. You went to the Bloemfontein
Hotel and demanded beer. "Are y' an orficer?" asked the dissipated
ruffian who served the bar.&mdash;"No." "Well, git out quick's yer
can." You went to the Royal Hotel, and the ubiquitous military
policeman threatened to run you in. You went to the 'Masonic,'
seeking refreshment, and, though your tongue hung out a yard by
reason of your dryness, they ejected you summarily. One recollected
these experiences, and felt almost inclined to call loudly from the
back of the hall: "Oh, Bobs, go slow! It wasn't our fault that we
were temperate&mdash;you funny little man. You seem to be pulling
our legs!"</p>

<p>None the less, although he seemed to credit the army as a whole
with virtues it did not possess, no one who has ever seen war can
fail to realise how much wisdom the commander of an army displays
when he prohibits the use of intoxicating liquors to his troops
upon entering a town. War is terrible and brutal enough when
conducted by sober combatants. What it would be when waged to its
logical conclusion by drunken fiends one's imagination almost fails
to picture.</p>

<p>One could not say that the speech was a triumph of oratory. It
was not. There was nothing dramatic in all its length, nothing
whatever that might appeal to the emotions. But it was lucid,
clear, forcible&mdash;and the manner of its delivery was the manner
of the man. It may have been as when a schoolmaster jokes, and all
the little boys laugh heartily, but, glancing round the hall at
times, it struck one as being extraordinary the way in which the
'Tommies' hung on to every word that dropped from beneath the
grizzled grey moustache, noted every point of the quick discourse,
applauded every telling argument brought forward. And most of them
seemed to be telling arguments. Never once was there the slightest
sign of the air referred to above as that of the
'it-must-be-right-because-I-say-it' class. The greatest soldier of
the Empire was speaking to some of the meanest, yet at no time did
he seem to be conscious of their, and his, relative positions.
Always, it was as man to man&mdash;never as Commander-in-Chief to
Tommy Atkins or Tommy Cornstalk, or any other humble 'pillar of the
Empire'.</p>

<p>He sat down, and the meeting spent ten minutes cheering him.
From what one knows of Atkins it is almost safe to say that there
could have been scarcely a score of men amongst the soldier
audience who were enthusiastic advocates of temperance. In all he
saw of them the writer cannot recall one single instance where the
British soldiers were not enthusiastic advocates of
beer&mdash;plenty of beer, unlimited beer. That is one of 'Tommy's'
faults. He will sell his soul for beer. It was not, one grieves to
say, that Tommy applauded the manly and wholesome sentiments of the
speaker. It was his fanatic love of the man that prompted him to
cheer so heartily. One does not sit in a hot building all through
an afternoon to hear the kind of thing, good though it be, that one
may hear any Sunday afternoon in any park at home. It was to hear
the Little Man speak, to listen to his kind voice, to see him, and
to look what manner of man he might be, that brought us mostly
there.</p>

<p>While he had been speaking one almost fancied that beneath the
quiet earnestness of all his words, the clear-cut, hard-hitting
sentences, there lurked a vein of sadness, a quiet undertone of
grief, which might never come in words to the surface, but which,
one still fancied, might nevertheless be there. One thought of the
dead son at Colenso, and of the guarded houses, and the lenient
proclamations, and the scowling people, and wondered whether there
could be many men like this one at our head&mdash;who would bear no
malice, and evidence no iron hand towards the people who had slain
his only son. Of course, he should not have allowed personal
feeling to sway his actions in such a manner, but most men would
have done so.</p>

<p>Once again, at the Vet River, our Brigade was drawn up on the
northern bank, just after crossing, and we were told that the
Commander-in-Chief wished to inspect us. We all looked upon it as a
privilege, and were eager to have the Little Man ride through our
ranks. For we were proud of our Brigade. And then, just as he was
coming, the writer and four others of his troop were sent out
scouting all the way to Smaldeel. We were infinitely disgusted, but
we had to go.</p>

<p>Months afterwards, as we lay encamped one morning beneath the
guns of Daspoort Fort without Pretoria&mdash;having been hunted
thither by De la Rey from Nitral's Nek during the best part of the
previous night&mdash;some of us had seen him ride away at noon, and
we knew that there had been bad trouble for some one, that some one
had felt 'the heavy hand,' and congratulated ourselves that we were
but simple troopers, having only to obey, and not to take
responsibility of failure. There was a set expression of unfeigning
anger that boded ill for some one. The iron jaws were close set,
and the seamed face hard with an expression that few men would
willingly encounter in their superior.</p>

<p>A sentry by the cottage at Sunnyside, of whom one day we asked
directions as to the office of the Military Secretary, had spoken
of another phase. Lord Roberts stood in the verandah above the
garden, talking to some one earnestly and at length. We had asked
the sentry jestingly did he know the Little Man?</p>

<p>"Know 'im!" he replied; "w'y, yuss, I jes' do know 'im. Friend
o' the fam'ly, 'e is. Day afore yestiddy, 'e comes along the street
on foot, an' w'en 'e gits ter the gite, er course I stan's ter ther
'present'. 'E comes bowlin' in, 's chippy 's if 'e'd bin to a
bloomin' dawg-fight. 'Good arternoon, sentry,' 'e sez, 'any one bin
arskin' arter the ole man?' Blime! I was that took back I 'ardly
knows wot ter s'y to 'im. Anyw'y, I manages ter git out as I didn't
think no one 'ad called. 'Wot's yer nime, sentry?' 'e sez. So I
tells 'im&mdash;nime, an' number, an' regimint. 'Wasn't yer farther
with me ter Khanderar?' 'e sez. Well, Lor lumme! yer could er
knocked me hover with a bleedin' swipe&mdash;me ole man 'ad bin
there, but I didn't think Bobs 'd er mide 'is acquinetance. Well,
'e did. Remembered 'im fer bein' 'colour' in a comp'ny wot 'd done
somethink or other. Ain't 'e a nobby little bloke? 'E knows crowds
an' crowds er blokes, too&mdash;an' yit 'e remembers me ole man,
jes' w'en 'e 'ears 'is nime!"</p>

<p>This is quite a true story&mdash;at least, if it is not, it is
the sentry's lie, not mine. But that is one of the many ways by
which Bobs has won the love and esteem of all the army. He never
forgets a face or a name, they say, of any one he has had to do
with, however humble.</p>

<p>And it is the most wonderful thing in all the world&mdash;the
way they <i>do</i> love him. To the regular army he is almost a god. One
sees his influence everywhere, and one never sees it without some
good effect. Of course, we Cornstalks and other outlanders of the
Empire only knew him as we saw him in South Africa. A few had read
his book, a few had worshipped him afar off always.</p>

<p>But it is Tommy Atkins who knows his true worth best. It is
Tommy who speaks most gratefully of the life-work of the Little
Man.</p>

<p>For not alone has he been a fighter, though he has seen more
fighting than any man alive. There are two rows of ribbons across
his jacket. It is not far short of fifty years since he went into
action first&mdash;since he first heard those whistling noises in
the air whose grim import we have learned to recognise but as
yesterday, and he has been hearing them ever since.</p>

<p>It is his peace-work, however, as much as his war-work, that has
won him the love of all the army. All who read must know of what he
has done. We, who have got to know Tommy in some minor aspects of
his varied being, can only testify to his grateful appreciation of
the efforts of 'Bobs' on his behalf. The common soldier at home
must have a bad time of it enough even to-day; but the
'haversack-bred' men whose fathers were in the ranks before them
will tell you how much the conditions of barrack-life have
improved, even in their remembrance. Especially will you hear this
from men who have served in India. And, even in Africa, the
Soldiers' Homes he opened&mdash;most excellent of institutions upon
active service&mdash;in each conquered town were of incalculable
benefit to all of us. His first and last efforts always seem to be
directed towards the amelioration of the conditions under which his
soldiers live. And that is one reason why we all loved him so
much.</p>

<p>In the fulness of time he will die. He is an old man now, and in
a few years&mdash;ten or twenty at the very utmost&mdash;the
hardships of a hardly spent life will have told upon him, iron of
brain and constitution though he be. His wars have been wars that
have not, at first sight, involved the deaths of mighty empires.
There has been no Waterloo for him to win, there has been no
lusting ambition in his nature to prompt him to make an Armageddon
of his name.</p>

<p>But there is this that may be written in his record&mdash;he was
a faithful servant of his country, he was a kind master, a humane
conqueror, and he was the saviour of the British Empire. Had we
lost South Africa we had lost much beside, and it was 'Bobs' alone
who saved Africa to us. In his time he has held powers that no king
or president of to-day may possess and live. He has held lives in
the hollow of his hand; he might have poured out blood in fertile
lands as a child pours water from a vessel. But always he has been
merciful, always just, always loved by any who have had to do with
him&mdash;even by his country's enemies&mdash;and therein lies his
greatness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII - THE ARMY</h2>

<p>In the week after the battle of Diamond Hill there were few
places in the world where so many varieties of English, so many
outlandish men of the Empire, met together and jostled one another
as in the streets of Pretoria.</p>

<p>After the short armistice immediately subsequent to the
evacuation of the capital by the Boer army and its occupation by
that of Lord Roberts, the troops had gone out to surround Louis
Botha. It had seemed, at one time in the two days' fighting, that
Louis Botha had almost surrounded the troops, but finally, at the
expense of many good lives, he had been compelled to retire a
little further toward the bush-veldt, northwards. And then the
great bulk of the army in the Transvaal sat down in its positions
to await the remounts hurrying from the south as fast as the single
line of narrow-gauge railway, the exploding culverts, and the
ubiquitous De Wet would permit. North, south, east and west,
Divisions and Brigades bivouacked in the surrounding veldt. The
kopjes about the town were hurriedly fortified and guarded by the
invaders against sudden attack. The surrendering of arms, and the
merry granting of permits to return to farms, went on as briskly as
it had done in the first days after the surrender of
Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>Nothing of very much importance was doing anywhere. Baden-Powell
from Mafeking, and Methuen from Fourteen Streams, were riding
through the Western Transvaal. Paul Kruger administered his vague
Government from the migratory saloon carriage on the Laurenco
Marques line, and hurled Scriptural exhortation at his dubious
burghers. It was a time of stagnation in the north. Below the Vaal
the Free Staters were alarmingly active, but here, in our part of
the 'Theatre of War,' nothing more serious went on than the
occasional sniping of pickets, and the intermittent cutting-off of
small British patrols by the hovering Boer commandos.</p>

<p>And so driblets and details of men 'on leave' from the great
chain of outposts about the town were continually coming in to see
Pretoria and buy provisions, and the peaceful Dutch capital seemed
to have taken on the cosmopolitan air that of right belonged to
Johannesburg, thirty miles down the line.</p>

<p>It was a kind of reunion of the army. The many elements that had
been drafted off into Brigades and Divisions and composite
regiments of sorts&mdash;each constituted after its kind&mdash;had,
as it were, sent delegates to meet informally in Church Street.
Groups of men representative of the four quarters of the globe
strolled about the quiet streets, filling their haversacks with
costly purchases of groceries; raiding the 'Post Kantoor' for
stamps of the (almost 'late') South African Republic; visiting the
State Museum; peeping into the empty church in the centre of the
Market Square; seeking Paul Kruger's house to gape at the Vrouw
Kruger; aimlessly wandering all about the town, from the barracks
of the Staats Artillerie to the late prison of the English officers
in the bird-cage&mdash;just as though the place were a resort of
excursion trains, and they curious tourists, come for a day to
stare about the 'sights'.</p>

<p>Upon the pavements, and in the shops, or gazing curiously into
the booksellers' windows where the priceless last issues of the
<i>Volkstem</i> and the <i>Standard and Diggers' News</i> were for a little while
displayed, were all manner of strange beings, most utterly
dissimilar in every aspect, save the outward one of dingy,
tattered, march- and battle-stained khaki. There were English
Tommies from the counties&mdash;sturdy fellows, slow of speech and
ponderous of thought; Cockney Tommies from the East of
London&mdash;slack of manners and <i>gamin</i>-like in bearing; Scotch
Tommies who were broad and sturdy, and altogether veritable towers
of massive strength; Irish Tommies, whose brogue preceded them
round corners; straw-hatted 'handy-men' of the 'Four-point-Sevens,'
who seemed to look with contempt upon the benighted 'soldiers' with
whom Fate, for a time, had cast in their lot. There were dainty men
of the City Imperial Volunteers; wealthy men of the Yeomanry; men
who knew Collins Street; men who had a nodding acquaintance with
Sydney, but a close friendship with the Western Plains; Tasmanians,
New Zealanders, Queenslanders, Manitobans, men of the North-West,
some of Ceylon, Indians, Burmans&mdash;all the queer mixture that
the Empire had been pouring ceaselessly into South Africa since the
war began.</p>

<p>There were little impromptu tea-rooms and hastily improvised
coffee-shops, where you might sit at table with them all, where the
rich brogue of Limerick mingled with the drawl of Canada and the
twang of the Australians&mdash;expensive places in which late
members of the Boer Army Service Corps and Commissariat departments
rapidly grew rich by selling boiled eggs for sixpence, and
beef-steaks for half-crowns. In them you might hear the jargons of
the trades of nearly all the known universe. Station overseers
exchanged views as to grazing with farmers from the Eastern
Province. Miners of Kalgoorlie discussed the cyanide process with
engineers of the Rand. Policemen of the Klondyke lied against those
of Little Bourke Street. Scotsmen fra' Edinboro' 'cracked' wi'
those of Otago. Troopers of Cape regiments argued in open Dutch
with the proprietors. It was as it had been at Bloemfontein in
March, and at Kroonstad in May.</p>

<p>Never again, until the Great War comes, will so many different
types of the Empire's soldiery gather together and behold one
another. Never again, until then, will there be such an opportunity
of comparing the men of the Old with the men of the New World.</p>

<p>Pretoria, in those days, was as a kaleidoscope. All the shifting
colours of the race to which we belong blended, and parted, and
massed in strange groups, as the bits of glass blend, and mass, and
fall apart within the toy. It was a chance to see the world as one
had never before seen it, and as one will have a great deal of good
luck if one ever sees it again. And, always forcing itself upon
one's mind, as one strolled about the streets, was the
consciousness of Empire, the vague realisation that we, the
English, and the Canadians, and the Australians, were a race that
overran the globe, and that its inheritance was ours.
Bumptiousness, if you will&mdash;but in the midst of that coming
together of the Four Corners it was a smugly satisfactory thought
that one could not well keep from one's mind. And there was another
one, too&mdash;less agreeable, but scarcely less
forcible&mdash;Heavens! Does it take all of us to crumple up two
little Dutch Republics lost in the middle of a great continent?
This last idea seemed to come as a kind of unpleasant but healthy
mental tonic.</p>

<p>To many of us who had never seen him in the mass before, the
Englishman was something new. Our ship had come to the South Arm at
Capetown Docks, and lain beside a boat-load of Yeomanry. As we drew
into the wharf, and lined the taffrail to get a closer view of the
land which was to give some of us our graves, there came strolling
about the pier strange people in khaki hats and clothing. They were
sturdier, fresher complexioned, plumper men than ours&mdash;neater
in their dress, and less self-assured in bearing. Glancing along
the ship's side, one saw a few hundred 'hard' faces peering
curiously at all they looked upon, chaffing a sturdy Zulu who
deftly manipulated a steel hawser, calling to one another to notice
new and striking things, and generally indicating by their manner
and bearing that they had assumed ownership over all South Africa,
from the Cape Peninsula to the Zambesi, and were just about to take
formal possession by stepping ashore. The hardness of the average
Australian face had never before come to one so vividly as it did
that morning in the docks, when one saw, for the first time, so
many ruddy, smooth-faced, flaxen Englishmen beside our
lantern-jawed, long-limbed, bark-featured Cornstalks, Crow-eaters
and Sand-gropers.</p>

<p>And this is a point amazingly noticeable all through the army of
South Africa&mdash;that though dress be the same to every button
and grease-spot, though arms and equipment may in no wise differ,
you will never have the least difficulty in distinguishing a
Colonial from an Englishman of England. By 'Colonial' one refers
not necessarily to the 'native born,' but as much to the men who
have lived with them for years, and learned their ways and habits
in their new land. We had many amongst us who probably had once
been as pink and white of countenance as were the Yeomanry.</p>

<p>This is the difference&mdash;the Colonial has lived a free life,
has had to shift for himself, has been, with more elbow-room,
rather more of his own master than has the average Englishman of
the same class. In short, the Colonial has had to 'battle' for
himself in all respects more than has the Englishman of his kind.
And he shows it in his carriage, in his manner, in his very
aggressive bearing, and his hardly veiled excellent opinion of
himself. He is one of the 'old hands'. The latter is a
Jackaroo.</p>

<p>Not that he remains a Jackaroo always. There is no one in the
world better gifted by nature to become an 'overseer,' but here, at
the starting-point, in the first experience of open air, he is
almost without exception what is known in Australia as a 'New
Chum'. And it is so of all the 'Tommies,' of all the Yeomanry
Corps, of all the Volunteers and Militia of England, when good
scouting, intelligent dependence upon self, and resource are
imperatively required necessities.</p>

<p>One does not say this in any spirit of ill-feeling. Than the
Yeomanry one would not wish to meet better fellows, or more
agreeable company, and as fighting men&mdash;good old English
fighting, not the Africander pattern&mdash;they are no whit behind
(it is even doubtful whether they are not a little ahead of) their
brethren of Greater Britain. But in this, and this again&mdash;the
exercise of what we term 'bushmanship'&mdash;until they have
learned by bitterly bought experience, they are for ever wanting.
Show them their enemy, and they will fight him and 'lick'
him&mdash;but don't trust them to go and find him themselves, or he
will inevitably discover them first, and possibly 'lick' them by
sheer wilyness.</p>

<p>As to 'Tommy' himself&mdash;who shall speak? He is a class
apart, a different species of mankind to any other upon earth. For
the sort of man he is, if you wish to learn, you must read Kipling.
He knows him, and he has described him as no one else may hope to
do.</p>

<p>We had never encountered him before, but we had read our Kipling
and were anxiously upon the look-out for what he had taught us to
expect. And we found him exactly as described. There were all the
strange expressions and twists of speech of <i>Soldiers Three</i>, and
many more beside, which no one might render into print. You may
trace his origin in his language, and generally it must be low
enough. But what seems to one most singular about him is that, out
of such material as the recruiting sergeant starts upon, the system
makes him into so good a production as it does. It may be
stupidity, it may be carelessness, but he is as cheerfully willing
to die as any man who lives. It is not his fault that he has no
individuality. It is the fault, and at the same time the
perfection, of his education&mdash;an education which for two
hundred years has sternly schooled him not to think, not to suppose
that he is even capable of thinking. He is foul-mouthed, he is
dull, he is brave, he is patient&mdash;he is exactly as one of his
own officers is recently reported to have described
him&mdash;<i>bovine</i>. That word seems to sum him up better than all the
pages one might write.</p>

<p>But there is another thing&mdash;he has a good heart, he is
kind, he is generous, and his public opinion is usually healthy and
correct. The following may illustrate his kindliness of heart.
Whether it be typical of the whole one is not quite certain, but is
almost inclined to believe so.</p>

<p>A few nights after the surrender of Bloemfontein a group of
Australian cavalrymen, who were attached as a squadron to a famous
dragoon regiment, stood talking about a little fire in the lines at
Wessels' Farm. With them were some few of the regiment of which
they had the honour to form a temporary part. Some one inquired of
another whether he meant to apply for a 'pass' to go into town.
"No," he replied, "what's the use? I'd like to have a look round,
but I've got no money!" Nothing more was said at the time, but
later, as the group broke up to seek its blankets, one of the
'Greys'&mdash;an utter stranger&mdash;touched the penniless one
upon the shoulder, and whispered to him: "Hey, chom, a can len' ye
ten shillin', gin ye wush tae gang t' the toon!"</p>

<p>Could anything have been much kinder? To his credit, the
Australian refused the proffered loan.</p>

<p>Of our own immediate kindred there were divers sorts. The men of
New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western
Australia were all much of a class. One has written of them all
practically under the heading of 'Tommy Cornstalk'. They are all
mainly sprung from the parent stock of the Hawkesbury and the
Hunter, or a common English ancestry, and have the same traditions
and characteristics in the main as one another.</p>

<p>The Tasmanians differed, perhaps, a little from the men of the
mainland&mdash;as Tasmania herself differs from the larger and more
modern island continent. One heard of them always as having done
good work. They had a commanding officer who seems to have been
perpetually 'looking for fight,' and who kept on looking for it
after having been wounded at least twice, if not more often.
Tasmania, smallest of all the Australian States, has the
distinction of having carried off, so far, all the V.C.'s granted
to Australians.</p>

<p>Some Queensland Bushmen who visited our camp near Pretoria had a
quaint story of the Victorians, which one would like to believe,
but which is scarcely probable. It was to the effect that this
particular lot of Banana-landers had gone round to Beira to join
Carrington's Rhodesian Column. When they arrived there a
steam-launch had come off to the troop-ship, carrying a fat
official clothed in white duck. He stepped on deck with all
politeness, and inquired beamingly what particular portion of the
Empire these so fine soldiers might grace with their presence when
at home.</p>

<p>"We're Queensland Bushmen," they told him.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;Queenslan'," he said meditatively. "Vell,
good morning. I cannot permit you to make to disembark 'ere. You
are as ze Veectorians&mdash;of Australia, is it not so? I regret
ver mooch, but ze Veectorians, zey lan'&mdash;zey do what you call
sketch&mdash;paint ze town red. Not ze bloodshed, I mean. But zey
seize ze hotel, drink up all ze beers, an' ze vines, an' ze
viskeys. My police expostulate&mdash;but zese wild Booshmen, zey
seize zem by force, an' place zem in ze preeson, an' make to
release all ze preesonaires. No, it is not possible to have more of
ze Booshmen of Australia in Beira. Zey are fine fellow, zese
Booshmen&mdash;but too wil', too wil'. I regret. I sorrow. I wish
you a so pleasant voyage back to Capetown."</p>

<p>The Queenslanders, indeed, returned to Capetown from Beira, and
joined in the chase of De Wet, but the reason given as to the
Victorians was probably the subsequent production of some fertile
brain.</p>

<p>The New Zealanders differed very materially from the 'Cornstalk'
troops, however. New Zealand has her own traditions of a fierce and
bloody war, which, even though it be of the last generation, is
still fresh enough in the memories of the people of to-day to give
added soldierly qualities to her sons. They themselves come of a
good stock. The climate of the islands is a healthy one. There is
something solid and abiding about her people&mdash;some stability
and sturdiness that, in the smallest degree, is wanting to our
possibly more mercurial temperament and constitution.</p>

<p>We of the Australians may all claim proudly that, even apart
from our troops having possibly distinguished themselves upon
occasion, there has never yet been anything of the
wholesale-surrender kind to bring down our average. But the writer
does not think than any Australian who has served in Africa will
quarrel with him for stating what he honestly believes himself to
be true&mdash;namely, that of all the troops engaged in this
arduous war, none were quite so good as the 'Maorilanders'. Never
once, in all the annals of it, did they fail to do the right thing
at the right time. Always they were ready when wanted, always to be
relied upon in 'tight corners,' always sure and constant in
everything they did.</p>

<p>Not that the others ever wanted either. That was an opinion of
Generals and lesser lights in the English army. There was a
cossack-post of the writer's own corps, doing duty one day in early
April east of Bloemfontein, which was suddenly attacked by a number
of Johannesburg Police, who sought to isolate the four men from
their main post. They briskly responded to the Boer fire, but,
whilst so engaged, their 'linked' horses broke loose, and wandered,
all unwitting of danger, to feed upon the scanty grass in front of
the little kopje upon which the post was stationed. One of the men
thereupon walked down the hill and led the horses round to the
back, neither they nor him receiving a scratch though under a
fairly hot, if long range, fire. Presently reinforcements came and
drove the Zarps away. The English officer in charge of the main
post had seen through glasses the risk the men of the cossack-post
ran of losing their horses and being themselves cut off, and had
come, hot-foot, to their assistance. He was much surprised to find
that the horses had been saved. "Ah!" he remarked to the corporal,
"you Australians always do well!"</p>

<p>And, though one says it as shouldn't, that was fairly
true&mdash;but the New Zealanders did, in the humble opinion of the
writer at any rate, just a little better.</p>

<p>Of the South African irregular regiments there was one corps to
which all others must yield pride of place&mdash;that splendid and
gallant body of Rand volunteers, the Imperial Light Horse. No corps
in all the war has seen quite so much, or done such distinguished
service, as this one. They began at Elandslaagte. Some went through
the Siege of Ladysmith, and some who had been shut out helped to
relieve the beleaguered town with Buller. Then they came round from
Durban, and went up to assist Mahon in his notable march to release
Mafeking. They came across the Western Transvaal and lost heavily
in the fighting about Pretoria in July. Then they went on again
towards Delagoa, and, for all the writer knows, may still be riding
on the trail of Botha or De Wet. At the end they will have a record
second to that of no regiment which has participated either in the
Natal or the Western Campaign&mdash;and they should never be
disbanded. Give the present members of the regiment their
discharges, if they wish, but, for the honour of its deeds, keep
the I.L.H. upon the shoulder-straps of a body of men in the
garrison of South Africa&mdash;which, if it comport itself as
excellently as did the originally constituted corps, will rival,
for efficiency and usefulness, that fine body, the Cape Mounted
Rifles itself.</p>

<p>The 'Horse' regiments seemed to be without limit. There were
Roberts' Horse, Kitchener's Horse, Marshall's Horse, Brabant's
Horse, Nesbit's Horse, Lumsden's Horse, Strathcona's Horse, Paget's
Horse, Australian Horse&mdash;and many others too numerous to
mention. The generality of them were South African corps, formed at
the commencement of the war, and supplied with drafts of men from
depôts in Capetown and Durban, as it progressed.</p>

<p>For some reason or other the Africander regiments were not
popular with the troops from over sea&mdash;neither Tommies,
Australians, nor Canadians seeming to care overmuch about them.
That they did splendid service no one can deny. Rimington's Guides,
Roberts' Horse, Kitchener's Horse, were always at the front. But
there was something that seemed to tell against them in the
estimation of their colonial cousins. It may have been that,
instinctively, no one quite trusted the Cape Colony. We had come
through their people after landing&mdash;for the front&mdash;and
had seen the railway line guarded and patrolled, even into the
suburbs of Capetown itself. We had met black looks and
ill-concealed dislike at every station on the way to Modder River
where the populace were allowed access to the platforms. And so,
possibly, there was some feeling regarding these
regiments&mdash;recruited in what was really an enemy's country,
and many of their members having Dutch names&mdash;that had given
rise to what was, one believes, an wholly unmerited distrust and
dislike. Not in any other corps would you hear manifested a so
bitter and general dislike of the Boers of both Republics as in
these; and there were no troops whom the Boers themselves loathed
so venomously as those of the sadly distracted colony. The siege of
Wepener, the disaster at Sanna's Post, and half a dozen other hot
and unhappy actions, had proved conclusively their loyalty and
devotion, and shown beyond any shadow of doubt how well and bravely
they could fight and bear themselves. And yet, the Boers hated them
with a hatred of disappointment, and the Tommies distrusted them
with a pig-headed and unreasoning distrust. Whatever their merits
or demerits may have been, the fact remains, however, that they
took their fair share of all the burdens of the campaign.</p>

<p>Of all the interesting groups of men who helped to form this
strange medley of an army there were none who, for picturesque
interest and fascinating detail of exploit, could approach within
helio-range of the Canadians. And in this connection the writer has
recently been doubting very much whether, in a book that purports
to be written by a Cornstalk about Cornstalks, he has not already
at various times devoted too much space to the doings of these
remarkable men&mdash;whether the beguiling shadow of the maple-leaf
has not rested too long and frequently upon pages that ought, more
properly, to have been chronicles of gum-tree and she-oak men. But,
through all the length and breadth of the land, campfire, and
hospital, and railway station echoed their weird deeds&mdash;they
made a name and recollection for themselves within South Africa
which will not be forgotten until the race-feud dies out and men
cease to speak of nineteen-hundred. Wherever you went, whomsoever
you might hold converse with, you heard mention of them. "Have you
heard the latest about those hard-cheeked Canadians?" became almost
a stock question when conversation flagged, or a new topic were
needed. And there was always something fresh or new to tell and
hear of them. One seemed to fall, almost unconsciously, under the
curious charm of their quaint collective personality. And every one
liked them. Undoubtedly they were the most interesting and
picturesque figures of the war. Their dashing actions, cool
ferocity, quiet 'slimness,' and guileless 'verneukery' of the Boers
themselves&mdash;and their pure hard cheek&mdash;rendered them
famous and fascinating wherever they went.</p>

<p>One has told so often of their prowess and their quaintly
serious modes of expression, that there is little left here to
explain&mdash;but this story of one of them, who out-Canadianed the
Canadians, may be worth recording, even though, possibly, it has
been told in print before. It is of a man whose renown travelled
through all Africa, who, though he was but a corporal of Mounted
Infantry, attained a degree of local fame such as some Brigadier
might even have envied. It was related to the writer by a Highland
officer in Wynberg Hospital, who, having allowed a bullet to pass
clean through his head somewhere in that neighbourhood, had been a
patient in the hospital at Vredefort, and had himself heard it from
both Boer and English sources.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that this Corporal Clarkson, of the Canadian
Mounted Infantry, you know, was rather a noted character in
Hutton's Brigade. They used to give him all the hard jobs to
do&mdash;ridin' out reconnoitrin' by himself, you know, and so
forth&mdash;and he generally managed to do whatever he was
instructed to, and a good deal beside. Sort of 'handy man' at
scoutin', you know.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;when French's crowd were just thinking about
crossing the Vaal, they camped a few miles outside a little place
called Vredefort&mdash;typical 'dorp,' an' all that&mdash;you know
the kind of thing. Expected a big fight somewhere about, but it
didn't come off. So, just to make sure, French thought he'd send
some one out to reconnoitre Vredefort. Accordingly, the M.I. were
told to find a patrol to do the job.</p>

<p>"Whoever it was had the sending out of the expedition I don't
know, but I really think that the man who picked Clarkson to lead
must himself have been a born leader of men, you know&mdash;sort of
chappy who recognises the qualifications of his men, you know, when
he wants anything done.</p>

<p>"So, this fellow Clarkson was paraded with five of his 'darned
out-fit,' as those chappies call themselves, you know&mdash;and
instructed to go and find out whether Vredefort was occupied or
not. So out he went.</p>

<p>"When they got to within about a mile of the town, they came
quite suddenly over a ridge on to a Boer outpost, or picket, or
something&mdash;consistin' of eight or ten lusty Dutchmen. Clarkson
arrived so very abruptly in their midst, that they hardly knew what
was the right thing to do&mdash;to shoot or run. Quite
flabbergasted 'em, you know. The gallant corporal took in the
situation at a glance&mdash;let on he was the General himself, you
know, and demanded their arms. I think they must have been a lot of
awful Johnnies, you know&mdash;kind of town guard of Vredefort or
something, because they just did as he told 'em. He took their
ponies, remounted his men fresh, sent the Boers away on foot, and,
leaving two men to guard the loot, continued his advance on
Vredefort.</p>

<p>"Well, when he rode into Vredefort, he found the Dutch people
fairly scared, you know. They knew French was pretty close, and had
been filling one another up with lies about what would happen if he
entered the place. There were white flags up on every chimney-pot
and gate-post.</p>

<p>"Clarkson simply rode straight up to the office of the
Landrost&mdash;sort of civil magistrate Johnnie, you know. By this
time he was Commander-in-Chief, <i>vice</i> Lord Roberts, resigned; if you
give a Canadian an ell he'll take as far as his rifle can
carry.</p>

<p>"Our friend simply demanded the surrender of the
town&mdash;nothing less! Well, the Boer Johnny was so very
overcome, you know, and so very much afraid of losing his billet,
that he thought perhaps he'd better do as requested, seeing also
that Clarkson must undoubtedly be a General of very great standing.
So, actin' under orders from Field-Marshal Lord Clarkson, he
summoned all the available burghers who had arms to deposit 'em
immediately in the Market Square, an' come an' listen to what the
great officer of General French had to say. Course, you know, they
think French has seniority of God Almighty. Altogether Clarkson
collected between forty and fifty Mausers and Martinis, stacked 'em
in a waggon, an' sent 'em into Hutton's camp with a note and one of
his remaining three men&mdash;having previously invited himself to
lunch with the Landrost at the hotel. I heard about the note; it
was something like this, you know:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"'Dear General,&mdash;Please receive accompanying armament of
one commando. I am pleased to state that I have this day captured
the city of Vredefort (fancy Vredefort a "city") and taken a large
number of prisoners, whom I propose, subject to your approval, to
release upon parole. You will be glad to hear that I am at the
present moment enjoying an excellent luncheon with the Mayor of
this city. We're havin' champagne! After lunch, as to-morrow will
be the birthday of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, I
propose to formally annex the city to the British Dominions. Hopin'
this will find you well, and in good spirits, as it leaves me at
present,&mdash;I am, dear sir, yours faithfully Duncan Clarkson,
Corporal, Canadian M.I.'</p>

<p>"Well, after lunch, he had 'em all called up into the Market
Square again. Some English lady had had a flag hidden away all the
time, and she produced it for the occasion. So Clarkson commanded
the Free State Flag to be hauled down, and ran the Union Jack up in
its place.</p>

<p>"Then he made 'em a great speech. Pointed out all the benefits
that would accrue to Vredefort under British rule, you know, an'
all that&mdash;and finally worked 'em up into quite a pitch of
enthusiasm, you know, so that they gave three cheers and sang 'God
save the Queen,' etcetera.</p>

<p>"But the best of it, you know, was a snap-shot which that
English lady took with a kodak, an' which I saw afterwards. There
were all the old Boer Johnnies, you know, cheerin' away like
anything, an' throwin' up their hats into the air&mdash;our brave
boy, seated on his pony in the middle of the crowd of 'em; smilin'
like a Cheshire cat, and&mdash;with one hand on the butt of his
revolver!</p>

<p>"Well, now, I call that 'moral suasion,' don't you?"</p>

<p>And now we will leave the Canadian, and the Africander, and the
Yeomanry, and the Tommies, and all the great gathering of the
Empire's outmost outposts in all their diversified glory, and
consider briefly another matter that is of some moment to us who
helped to earn it&mdash;the reputation of the army.</p>

<p>In Pretoria, one morning, the writer had an opportunity of
conversing with an Irish-American who had served under the
redoubtable Blake, 'Colonel' of the Boer-Irish Brigade, and, being
disgusted with that worthy person, and 'full-up of fighting,
annyway,' had surrendered his Mauser and was for compulsory
deportation shortly. Had been, he said, a burgher of the Transvaal.
Had been, also, at Ladysmith, Colenso, and on the Tugela, and was,
on the whole, rather a decent fellow&mdash;very different to the
stray prisoners of Blake's disreputable command whom one had
hitherto encountered. It was not "Go to hell!" with him to every
question asked.</p>

<p>He had fought with the Boers because he had believed, and still
believed, in the justice of their cause. And then he told the
horrible story which one fancies that delightful gentleman, Mr.
Michael Davitt, was the first to 'father' in print. It was the old
Boer anecdote about the patrol of brutal lancers in Natal, who,
being in the debatable lands foraging, had incontinently misused a
farmhouseful of Dutch women and girls to such a dreadful extent
that some of them had lost their reason, and one had died. And he
believed it.</p>

<p>Well, there have been stories printed in our own papers as to
frightful Boer atrocities&mdash;wretched crimes such as you would
not book to black fellows&mdash;which have received only too ready
credence in the public mind of England and the Empire. And if you
get files of last year's <i>Standard and Diggers' News</i>, you will find
that just the same kind of stories were served out, hot and
smoking, to the people of the late Republics. You may believe them
or not, as you please. No one can actually dispute them now, even
if one wished to take the trouble. It is one of the most miserable
features of war&mdash;the malevolent lying that takes place upon
both sides&mdash;not so much among the actual combatants as between
the skulkers behind each respective army. Personally, one believes
no worse thing of the Boers than of our own people. There are
blackguards in every army, but in most you will find, if you look
below the surface, that public opinion is astonishingly
healthy.</p>

<p>But this much one may say, and say with no fear of contradiction
by those who are competent to judge&mdash;that the British Army, as
a whole, was precisely what Lord Roberts described it as
being&mdash;"an army of gentlemen".</p>

<p>If you do not judge a man by the fit of his clothes, or whether
he eat appallingly with his knife, or make weird noises as he
absorbs soup, you will look to the broad principles of his larger
actions when you wish to classify him as either 'gentleman' or
'blackguard'. And, regarding the whole mass of the soldiery of the
Empire, both regular and volunteer, who fought in South
Africa&mdash;one may say unhesitatingly that they certainly did not
behave as 'blackguards'. We may have used bad language, we may have
done a little looting, or used 'moral suasion' when we starved, but
never once did the writer, in all the marching between Paardeberg
and Nitral's Nek, see, or hear of, one case of a woman, black or
white, being maltreated or mishandled in any way. And it was not
for lack of opportunity. It was not, perhaps, because there were
not men amongst us who would stick at nothing in the satisfaction
of their more brutal inclinations. But it was because of
this&mdash;that an Englishman is an Englishman, a Canadian a
Canadian, an Australian an Australian, a White Man a White Man all
the world over, and that, wherever the leader of any army sets his
face sternly against brutality or inhumanity, then there will be
little or none of either.</p>

<p>And so, again, writing as one of the humblest 'rankers' in it,
one may agree with the Great Little Man who led it, that the South
African Field Force was an army of gentlemen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV - THE BOER</h2>

<p>"Fetch us Kruger's scalp!" said the crowd that lined the
streets, as we struggled hotly to Woolloomooloo Bay on a sweating
afternoon in January. "Don't take any notice of white flags; play
'em at their own game; wipe 'em out; give 'em hell!"&mdash;they
cried as we led our horses up the gangway. "Good-bye, boys,"
screeched an excited lady on the wharf; "put their blanky lights
out!"</p>

<p>There had been Stormberg, and Magersfontein, and
Colenso&mdash;and Spion Kop was to come. The facile pen of the
paragraphist had described the incidents of treacherous ambush. The
tame leader-writers of the most respectable morning paper in the
wide world had, with all deference to possible varieties of
opinion&mdash;which they would not for all the riches of Mount
Morgan unwittingly offend&mdash;given it as their unalterable
dictum that the Boer was an excrescence upon the fact of all
humanity, that he should, without doubt, be made to feel the 'iron
hand,' that this war was none of your common, bloody, uninviting
struggles, but a holy crusade against infamous wrong, and
injustice, and unreasonable tyranny. Most touchingly symbolical of
its righteous approval of our going, the enthusiastic crowd had
given us to drink of raw whisky, as we shoved, and pushed, and
panted thirstily through it. And doubtful damsels, to whom one
would never before have attributed any of the broad feeling that
leads to publicly expressed emotion, had clung weepingly about our
necks, and kissed us lovingly, as they implored us to go forth and
battle for what was right, and good, and noble, against oppressive
wrong and wretched, heartless cruelty.</p>

<p>And so, by the time that we were up the shrouds, and the crowd
was a mere blur along the shore, expressive only by points of
waving white and a murmuring roar that lost itself across the
widening waters, we really did feel enthusiastic admiration for
ourselves. We honestly understood ourselves to be, as it were,
knights-errant of no mean order, going forth to wrest the fair
maiden of African freedom from the vile clutches of the Boer
dragon.</p>

<p>It was a splendid feeling to possess&mdash;you can have no idea
as to how very noble and estimable our souls felt themselves to be.
The Holy Grail itself was in Pretoria, or Johannesburg, and we were
going to get it.</p>

<p>In Adelaide the people had again gone mad. Men of the Stock
Exchange&mdash;fat, worthy members of Society&mdash;had clutched us
frantically by the arms, and given us to drink of choice vintages.
The North Terrace and the railway station had farewelled us with
more delightful fervour than even if we had been an Australian
Eleven driving round in drags, ere it sought Largs Bay and the
track to victories in English cricket-grounds. Fremantle had been a
little madder. Truly, it was something to be a soldier.</p>

<p>And we sailed away knowing all about everything. There was no
possibility of our having made any mistake as to the Boer. We had
him at our finger ends. He was a low liar, a cunning, unscrupulous
cheat, an oppressor of the unfortunate philanthropists who had come
to make his country rich.</p>

<p>The Uitlander, for whom we were going to do battle, was indeed a
long-suffering, overburdened martyr. Purely for philanthropy he had
sought to do the Transvaal a good turn. He had toiled, with some
success, to wrest the golden treasure of the unwilling Rand from
its hidden depths. He had made a bankrupt State into a rich one. He
was the kind of man who shoved the world along. And they wouldn't
give him a vote. So we were going to get it for him. The Boer had
been weighed in the balance and found wanting. We would adjust the
scale.</p>

<p>And even as we thought we were right, and just, and ethically
correct in assisting the mother country to make war in Africa, so
do we still to-day&mdash;after we have been, and learned what war
really is, and sobered ourselves in scenes of misery from the
drunkenness of the 'hurrahing' streets, and the hysteric quays, and
the lying newspapers. But it is upon other grounds that we so
justify ourselves. And we have learned to think a little
differently of the Boer.</p>

<p>There is a dreadful crime against all moral decency, a hopeless
offence against all that is right, and just, and proper. It is so
serious an offence that one may reasonably hesitate before laying
oneself open to the charge of having been guilty of it. In its most
abandoned state of depravity and perversion it does not merely
suggest, it confirms and makes positive the fact that the offender
against all good and worthy codes of political thought is a
treasonable plotter and outcast conspirator against his country
too. He is an enemy of England, an insidious foe to the welfare of
the Empire. He has committed the unpardonable sin. Henceforth he
should be treated mercilessly as a pariah. He is an 'Ishmael'
amongst his fellows. He is incapable of reason&mdash;he is
hopelessly insane. We should 'cut' him in the street, if he be an
acquaintance. We should bestir ourselves to put him down, to expose
him, to hold him up to ridicule, to make his life a weary burden.
He is not even worth reforming.</p>

<p>And so the writer hopes, and prays, and ponders within himself
as he writes&mdash;almost overwhelmed by the nightmare fear that he
may be charged, too, with this unspeakable wrong-doing, that little
boys, and old women, and worthy men may arise and point the finger
of scorn at him, and damn him, soul and body, with the awful
accusation of 'Pro-Boer'.</p>

<p>It is so easy to have this cry hurled at you. You have but to
say that the African Dutch do not all live in pig-styes, that some
few of them can read and write, that there are even some who do not
play with white flags perpetually. To assert that the Devil is not
so black as he is painted is wicked and untrue&mdash;because every
one knows that he is as black as black can be, even though no one
has ever seen him.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;but it can't be helped. With a full knowledge of all
the dreadful meaning of 'Pro-Boer,' and what he lays himself open
to by reason of his saying so, the writer cannot but state that, as
we found him, the Boer was not such a bad fellow after
all&mdash;not nearly so black as he has been painted. He was,
indeed, not one whit better than he should have been, but, in the
actual waging of war, he was not nearly so bad as he might have
been.</p>

<p>Books, and magazines, and newspapers had almost taught us to
believe that we should meet in Africa some kind of a sub-tropical
Esquimo&mdash;a hairy, primitive 'loafer,' with the manners of a
cave-dweller and the principles of a gorilla. We had looked for a
species of debased creature unpossessed of any powers of thinking,
with no perception of anything that lay beyond the narrow horizon
of his straitened intellectual outlook. We had taken 'Boer' to be
synonymous with 'boor'. We had been unable to understand why, or
how, he had made matters so uncomfortable at Magersfontein for such
men as the Highlanders, led by such skilled and quick-witted men as
we had supposed the English officers to be. It was inexplicable to
us how such a creature could possibly have 'enough in him' to make
the Empire look so foolish as he had undoubtedly been doing for the
few months in which it had waged war with him. Buller was to have
eaten his Christmas dinner in Pretoria. It seemed to be rather by
good luck than anything else that Joubert was prevented from eating
his in Durban.</p>

<p>Now, how could it come about that such a people as these were
said to be&mdash;a so slow, dull, unprogressive, shiftless
people&mdash;could give our armies so much trouble, could kill our
men by the hundred, and capture them by the thousand? When we made
the better acquaintance of the Boer we learned why it was.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from Fremantle to the Orange River. You have
time to think and consider matters, with a good deal of attention
to detail, in the time that elapses between your departure from one
and your arrival at the other. There is the blue solitude of the
Indian Ocean, for two clear weeks at least, and after that the
speedless journey in the train. But it was first at Orange River
station that we made the acquaintance of the Boer in any quantity,
and it was there that we first began to doubt the fixity and
unchanging nature of our ideas about him. There, too, we first had
a glimpse of insight as to the reasons why he had given our
Generals and their armies such a deal of trouble.</p>

<p>When our long string of cattle-trucks containing horses, and
second-class carriages containing Cornstalks, had jolted and bumped
into the station, they had relegated us to a siding, and left the
main line beside the platform clear and open&mdash;evidently for a
more important train than ours. In course of time it had rolled in
beside us, and from our windows we looked out upon an excursion
train-load of shearers, or 'cockies,' or ordinary 'bush hands'
going down, <i>en masse</i>, with their coats off, to 'blue their
cheques'. But in each carriage was the glimmer of bayonets, and, as
the train stopped, more bayonets came along beside the carriages
and took up positions of vantage in the space between us.</p>

<p>Who were these people? Ah! possibly the poor of Kimberley just
relieved, and being taken to Capetown for a change. No, that
couldn't be correct. Were they Boers? we ventured to ask the
supporter of a bayonet below our window.</p>

<p>"Yes, they be Cronjy's men&mdash;seven hundred of 'em, an' they
stinks 'orrid."</p>

<p>Boers!&mdash;Boers!&mdash;these men Boers? Oh, no; they could
not be, surely! Where were the brutal faces of the English
illustrated papers? There were a few, a very few, who came up to
our conception of a Boer, but the majority seemed decent,
intelligent men enough. Their clothes were dirty and clay-stained.
They wore moleskins, and riding breeches, and weather-worn tweed
coats, and their beards were mostly untrimmed, but where were the
'wild-men-from-Borneo' kind whom we knew well were the only genuine
Boers? A great proportion of their train-load were beardless boys
or venerable greyheads. Where were the savage beast-like creatures
whom we knew we should expect? These men could not be the real
Boers. They were not at all like the pictures we had seen.</p>

<p>But, yes&mdash;there was no doubt. These were the men from
Paardeberg. These were the ferocious creatures who had lived for
more than a week upon the smell of lyddite fumes, in a place that
was the first cousin to the Hobs of Hell. These boys, and
patriarchs, and smaller proportion of able-bodied men, had indeed
seen more than ever we had done of war, and felt its cruel weight
more heavily than we hoped would fall to our lot to feel. These
quiet, orderly, rather good-humoured people! We watched their train
roll away with a curious feeling of having been somehow
deceived.</p>

<p>Yes, those were the Boers of Boerdom&mdash;Transvaalers mostly,
who were reputed to be even more wild and unkempt than the
Freestaters, who lived very close to the Basutos, and might
reasonably be supposed to have acquired their ways. Somehow we were
disappointed in them. It was rather like going to see some much
advertised entertainment, and finding, when you had paid your money
and gone inside, that the reality fell very far short of the
posters. We had seen infinitely better specimens of the real Boer
in some of the back creeks and dark gullies at home on the
Hunter.</p>

<p>And so we went on, and finally, at the end of months, we came to
Pretoria&mdash;much more educated people than when we had shipped
ourselves at Woolloomooloo. We had fought him, chased him, taken
him prisoner, narrowly escaped from the tricky snares he set for
us, seen him in his home, drawn his fire from his own beloved
kopjes, played him at his own game, looked upon his dead&mdash;and
our opinion of him was quite a different matter altogether from the
ideas with which we had equipped ourselves before leaving Sydney.
We had seen how he lived; we had learned what manner of
slothfulness had kept him from using aright the good land which God
had given him, and recognised how little he deserved to keep it
therefore&mdash;since no man has a right to any good thing unless
he use it well. We had talked and argued with him, had got to know
his peculiar ways of thinking, had faintly understood his mental
state, had discovered for ourselves some of his many faults, had
seen how the white flag trick was played&mdash;and&mdash;one
confesses it almost apologetically in view of the possible charge
of 'Pro-Boerism' referred to above&mdash;had come to respect him,
in the mass, as a very gallant man, and to envy in him the
possession of hardy virtues such as we had never expected to find,
and which we would not mind feeling quite sure that we possessed
ourselves.</p>

<p>There lives upon the outskirts of Pretoria, in a little iron
cottage, a gaunt old Boer of many years and much experience, with
whom the writer chanced to become, in a measure, friendly&mdash;as
friendly as any hated rooinek may become with one of his
uncompromising sort. He was a tall, dark man, grizzled and
iron-grey, with the whipcord neck muscles that you see in thin old
men who have lived much in the sunlight. He was as spare, and lank,
and brown as any Queenslander. And he loved his country with a
fervent love that would hear no evil of it. He seemed to like
speaking about its troubles to any one who would listen, and was
pitiably anxious to make at least one 'Englander,' as he included
all of us, think less hardly of his people than he supposed they
did.</p>

<p>Sitting in the shade of a paling fence, we discussed many things
through rank clouds of Transvaal tobacco. He had been a fighting
man all his life, but had come home when Pretoria fell&mdash;stiff
with rheumatism&mdash;to find his wife but just recovering from the
shock of his reputed death whilst on commando, and his little
daughter seven weeks dead of typhoid. So there was to be no more
war for him, though he never would admit the overthrow of his
beloved Republic. Were not the Russians at war with England over
China? Would they not bombard Capetown and Durban? Were not the
Cape Dutch about to rise, and cut us off from the sea?</p>

<p>He had been at Bronkhurst Spruit in '81, and over the crest of
Majuba in time to see Colley fall. His story of the storming of
Majuba was curiously interesting.</p>

<p>"Ja! in the morning, there were the English above us. We could
see them walk about and stand against the sky. The Boers they were
all frighten'. It was bad, very bad. Piet Joubert was angry. He
call us young men to him, and he say: 'This is not good. You have
not done well. I am angry for it. You have let rooibaatjes come up
there, and now you must drive them down again.' Ja&mdash;he was
very angry&mdash;the so careful Piet. So we went up. No, there were
not so many tree&mdash;a few bushes, and many rocks, and the grass
was long. We take a long time, and it was very steep. But we go so
carefully, so very slowly, from rock to rock. They stand up to
shoot us, and we shoot them&mdash;so. Ah, you do not have the white
hats now, or red coats! It is not so easy. We get up close, very
close&mdash;the officers come and stand against the sky to shoot
their pistols at us. We laugh, and shoot them. It is so funny, what
you English did in that war. You play bands when you fight. That is
wrong. It is not hard to hear the bands coming. And the flags to
shoot at! It is not so now. But we come to the top of the kop, and
they are all together like frightened buck&mdash;&mdash;" But it
was not a pleasant story. And Bronkhurst Spruit was less so.</p>

<p>There was much to learn from the old man. He would admit many
things. Personally, he deplored the white flag incidents, but
stoutly maintained that our guns had shelled their ambulance
waggons. He was willing to admit that distance does not sometimes
help to distinguish an impromptu hospital van from an ammunition
cart, but claimed the same reason for occasional lapses on the part
of the Staats Artillerie. For the white flag he shrugged his
shoulders. "If I steal oxen, it is not that every one in the
country will steal oxen too. There are bad men always. I know the
commandants do not like it. Louis Botha it has sometimes make very
angry. But the Boers have not orders like the English. Every
burgher does as he wishes. It is not always possible to watch them
all. I have not done it."</p>

<p>As to expanding ammunition, he made a statement which startled
the writer.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he said, "you say we have used it! So&mdash;we have
done so&mdash;but why? I will tell you why&mdash;and then you shall
tell me what you think. When we drive the English from Dundee, to
shut them up in Ladysmith, they go so very quick that they have not
time to take all with them. They do not even have time to burn all
that they leave behind. So, we find biscuits, and beef, and
whisky&mdash;ja!&mdash;plenty of things that are very good for us.
And also there is much ammunition in boxes&mdash;what you call it,
sof' nose, eh? Dum-dum? Almighty! I tell you, the Boers are very
angry. They say, 'If the English use it, we shall use it too! Why
not? It is right for us, if it is right for you.' I think myself it
is bad to use&mdash;but if you, then the Boers also. We know you
use it first of all, because we find it in Dundee when the English
have trekked away so quickly. What of that, tell me, mine
friend?"</p>

<p>His friend could not explain. Was it that, in the hasty retreat
of Yule's column, the possible Dum-dum ammunition brought from
India by the troops which came from there at the earliest outbreak
of hostilities, and withdrawn from them, as we know it was, had
been by some oversight left undestroyed in store at Dundee? That
seemed to be the only explanation, but, unfortunately, it did not
find ready acceptance with the Boers. The writer rashly questioned
a Commandant in Wynberg Hospital as to the same thing, and, to his
humiliation, heard the same depressing story.</p>

<p>Expanding ammunition, one is quite certain, was never
countenanced by the British authorities; but it is always possible
to suppose that our own men, finding it in the bandoliers of dead
Boers, may have used an occasional cartridge without their
officers' knowledge.</p>

<p>Of Boer inhumanity we have heard many stories. Some of them may
possibly be true. Any story is true until it is disproved, despite
the English maxim as to a man's innocence being taken for granted
until his guilt be clearly established. That may hold good in law,
but it does not in scandal-mongering. But this much the writer can
unhesitatingly affirm&mdash;that, though he read many accounts in
English and Australian newspapers of dastardly acts committed by
the Boers upon prisoners and wounded, he never once, whilst at the
front, could learn of any genuine instance where such things
happened. Indeed, men of his own corps, who were wounded and taken
prisoners at Zand River in May, speak gratefully of the kind
treatment meted out to them by their captors. One is inclined to
believe that much of the odium cast upon the Boers arises from the
unfortunate lying that seems to be engendered in a war, upon both
sides.</p>

<p>But, even admitting that there may be a foundation of
truthfulness in much that has been charged against them, there is
one unhappy fact which it would be well for us to recollect, and
that is that to the average Boer an Englishman is a being who ranks
lower than a Kaffir. He is one to whom, if you may do so safely,
you may quite permissibly extend the harshest treatment. No one who
has not spoken with them, and had opportunity of gathering some
notion as to the hatred and contempt and distrust with which they
regard everything English, can quite realise this in its full
significance.</p>

<p>One day a patrol of Australians, riding through the country
between Boesman's Kop and the Bloemfontein waterworks, called at a
farmhouse to see whether its members could purchase anything in the
way of provisions. There were no menkind there except a couple of
Kaffir 'boys'. The mistress of the house could only sell them a
glass of milk each, which they were glad enough to get. Afterwards,
in course of conversation, she admitted that she was sick of the
war, and expressed a fervent wish that it would soon be over. Her
husband was away on commando, and her eldest son&mdash;a boy of
fifteen&mdash;had been killed at Modder River. Of her husband she
had had no word for three months. He had gone northward in the
flight from Bloemfontein, and, for all she knew, might be dead
also. Some one asked her how she thought the English and Dutch
would get on with one another&mdash;would they forget all past
ill-feeling, and settle down quietly and happily together for the
good of the country when once the war was over? Had she herself
anything against the English? "Ah, no," she said bitterly; "I have
not anything against them&mdash;oh, no&mdash;they have only killed
my little Piet! That is nothing. My man's oxen are all
gone&mdash;that also is nothing!" Then, with sudden fierceness,
pointing to the child on her lap, "You see my little girl here;
well, if I ever thought she would grow up and marry one of your
English, I would take her now and dash her brains out against the
door-post!"</p>

<p>That is how they hate us. And it will be many years before the
hatred dies away. Blood is a hard thing to forget. The smell of it
remains with you afterwards. Wives who have lost their
breadwinners, mothers who have lost their sons&mdash;be they Dutch
or English&mdash;do not reason overmuch about the ethics of their
losses. It is nothing to them whether the war was a just one,
whether their beloved died for a righteous cause. They only know
that the cruel English, or the cruel Dutch, have robbed them of
some one whom all the fine arguments in the world will not bring
back, and so, for years and years, the sad women of those countries
will loathe and detest all things English more bitterly than
before. Their hatred of us already dates from before the Great
Trek, from before the hanging of Slachter's Nek, and comes across
the war of '81. Now it will have all the hard misery of this war to
add to its rankling bitterness. There is a difficult task before
the coming rulers of the two late Republics.</p>

<p>And so, when we hear that the Boers have been unduly lax in
honourable dealings with our kinsfolk, we must remember how they
regard them. What an invasion and conquering of our country by
Chinese would mean to us, the invasion and taking of theirs by the
English means to them.</p>

<p>A state of war does not usually exhibit the non-combatants of an
invaded country to their best advantage, although naturally there
are many opportunities for the display of heroism and
self-sacrifice of a high order. The type of Boer with which one
came in contact was not always the best. He was usually a prisoner,
or sick or wounded in hospital, or one of those not very noble
beings&mdash;a burgher-on-parole. One cannot but feel the highest
personal respect for the men who have uncompromisingly kept the
field, as contrasted with those who have surrendered early, and are
busily employed in making money out of their country's enemies.
But, as a rule, one finds them such an interesting and many-sided
people, that there is some regret at not having made their
acquaintance years ago in peace-time, so that one might be the
better qualified to judge of them. They have, one suspects, been
frequently the victims of too hasty judgment. It would possibly
have been easier to understand them better, had one been able to
mix with them in their laagers. But, in the marching and fighting
of the war itself, one was really able to make only a superficial
acquaintance with them. Their habits of cunning warfare were really
their most striking characteristic. And these taught you, that in
Africa one must always be ready to distrust the obvious. Perhaps,
indeed, that is one explanation of their noted 'slimness'.</p>

<p>Of Paul Kruger, and the Pretoria clique, and Dr. Leyds the
writer knows little save what he has read. Better informed people
have dealt with them. But this much is quite certain&mdash;that no
matter how the Pretorian party plotted, or the Africander Bond
dabbled in treason in the Cape Colony, the commoner Boer knew only
that he fought for his independence. And Boer independence in South
Africa does not merely mean autonomy for the two Republics. It
means one Dutch State, and no English, save on sufferance. Knowing
this, can we not extend some generosity of feeling towards brave
men, who have fought pluckily against overwhelming forces in what
was, to them, a sacred cause?</p>

<p>The writer hopes sincerely that this chapter may not draw upon
him the reader's scorn and contempt as being another of those
strange people&mdash;the 'Pro-Boers'. But possibly the fact of
having 'chanced one's hide' a few times in action with them will
render apology needless. One has small sympathy with Englishmen
who, once the country having been involved in war, wilfully admire
and encourage the enemy. 'A long rope and a short shrift' for those
who are traitors to their country is unfortunately out of date.
This much he would be glad if he could feel that he may possibly
have made clear in the foregoing pages&mdash;that because you are
at war with a people it makes your case no better to libel them;
that there are as likely to be justice and reason upon their side
as yours; that, even if you kill a country, there is no reason why
you should traduce its memory also.</p>

<p>One might write indefinitely as to the Boers. From the point of
view of the picturesque, at least, they are worth ten volumes,
rather than one meagre chapter. But here space forbids.</p>

<p>Let us, however, try to remember so much as this. These people
are much of the same kind as we. They have the open air to live in
just as we have. They are not monsters of iniquity and treachery
altogether. They have fought bravely and well against odds that
might have well overwhelmed them in the contemplation&mdash;and it
was not because they were ignorant. They may be liars by nature,
they may be cunning, they have not used their country as they might
have done. We were quite justified in fighting them to a
finish&mdash;but let us at least act the manly part of giving them
what credit is their due, of refusing to believe the cruel lies
which interested parties have put forth. Let us be fair, and just,
and generous&mdash;if we can.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV - THE END</h2>

<p>"An unhappy land"&mdash;no phrase or words could possibly sum up
the situation of South Africa to-day better than these, none could
have a deeper or sadder meaning to any one who has seen recently
the bitter distraction of all the country there. It is a land
drenched with the best blood of its people, and with the best of
ours; a land ravaged, and wasted, and made empty; a land afflicted
with the curse of the soldier from end to end. It is as a
grievously sick man, who is incapable of earning his own living,
and has to be supported by some one else. There is nothing there.
Its industries are man killing and maiming; its exports are human
lives.</p>

<p>Take the train at Kroonstad and journey to the Vaal. It is not
very far, but you will not travel so quickly that you may not look
out and see for yourself how the land lies. You will pass out of
Kroonstad with a great canvas hospital upon your left. Blue-clad,
miserable men will listlessly take stock of your train as it passes
by. Up above the white tents, on a little slope of open veldt, you
will see rows of mounds. Perhaps the grass has grown over some of
them by now. They were bare and new when the writer came by six
months ago. You will run past America and Jordaan
Sidings&mdash;empty voids, where nothing but a station signboard
notifies the fact that they have been stopping-places for trains in
some other age. You will pass over culverts and little bridges that
have been blown up with dynamite, and rapidly repaired out of old
sleepers and nondescript material of all kinds by that wonderfully
efficient Railway Pioneer Regiment. At frequent intervals there
will be twisted rails and partially burned sleepers beside the
tracks&mdash;no, on second thoughts, there will be no sleepers,
because the patrols will have garnered them up for fuel. Sometimes
you will come across wrecked and burned railway trucks and other
rolling-stock.</p>

<p>At little stations, such as Honing Spruit, you will find all
manner of curly and angular entrenchments and gun emplacements, and
redoubts, and far out sangars for the outposts, and a bewildering
entanglement of encircling barbed wire. And there will be harassed
officers, and empty tins of bully-beef, and discontented 'Tommies,'
and a demand for news.</p>

<p>At Roodeval you will see the row of seven graves beside the
line&mdash;each one ornamented with its wooden cross, and caps and
sides of nine-inch shells, and little surrounding borders of
stones. And, out across the veldt, you will see the places where
Christian De Wet planted his guns, and shelled the Fourth
Derbyshire beyond all endurance. By this time the half-burned
letters from the captured mail-bags will hardly be so much in
evidence as they were in August of last year, and the acres of
fire-destroyed khaki clothing will not be at all noticeable.</p>

<p>At the Kopjes Siding you may possibly come across an armoured
train, with its 'pom-pom' on the leading truck, and its steel-lined
trucks for men, and boiler-protected engine, and air of readiness
for sudden call. Its crew will be playing football in the veldt.
But they won't be very far away from their rifles and bandoliers of
cartridges. It is inexpedient to be overdistant from your rifle in
this part of the world.</p>

<p>But one common feature of the landscapes which you pass through
will probably strike you much more forcibly than any other. You
will wonder what may have become of the population, the dwellers in
the veldt, the obviously inevitable inhabitants whom such a good
country should support. You will perceive that the veldt is dotted
at intervals with white houses, which are sometimes shaded by the
blue-green gum leaves you know so well. You will be at a loss to
understand why no one lives in them, why there are no flocks of
sheep about the downs, or herds of cattle drinking at the dams. It
will strike you that the only stock in this country are Mounted
Infantry ponies.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, as you pass a house that is closer to the
railway-line than usual, you will perceive the reason of this
dearth of population. The windows are empty and gaping. The roof is
gone. Broken pieces of furniture and household effects litter the
ground in front and rear. There is nothing left. To live in such a
place would not be at all comfortable. One or two will have
shell-holes in the walls. If you get out of your carriage and look
very closely you will be able to find little chipped holes in the
white-washed mud plaster of the walls, where the bullets have
struck.</p>

<p>And that is the way it is everywhere. These places along the
line have been burned and destroyed in accordance with the warning
Lord Roberts gave the inhabitants as to raids upon his
communications. It is quite fair and legitimate, generally
speaking. We must establish British rule&mdash;gently, if possible,
but it <i>must</i> be established. Away from the line, too&mdash;if you
have not seen enough to prove to you that this is 'an unhappy
land'&mdash;you will find the burned and empty houses, the
impoverished farms. It cannot be helped. We have tried lenient
measures&mdash;a leniency which only returned to us in derision.
These people are obstinate. We mean to have our way. They must be
made to feel that the yoke will weigh heavily until our way is
theirs also.</p>

<p>But it is cruel&mdash;bitterly, heartrendingly cruel!</p>

<p>It is not only in the gutted dwellings that you will see the
cruelty and horror of it all. Go back from the Vaal to
Bloemfontein, and walk to the cemetery below the old fort and
beside the barracks of the late Free State Artillery. You will find
some graves of British soldiers which have been occupied since the
early fifties, but you will find them vastly outnumbered by the
graves of those who found a resting-place there in 1900.</p>

<p>Of coming from a visit to some sick comrades in the Artillery
Barracks, which were then occupied by the Australian Hospital, the
writer has one very vivid recollection. Walking beside the
graveyard wall, we had paused to watch the burial of some officer,
which was a little more noticeable than the generality of funerals
for the reason that his body was enshrouded in a Union Jack instead
of a brown blanket. We mounted our horses, and rode round the
corner of the stone enclosure. At the gate were lying on the grass
six stiff shapes, sewn tightly up in their blankets&mdash;probably
the blankets they had died in. The fatigue parties within were so
busy that, for a few minutes, they had not had time to come out and
carry the dead men in, and the cart, probably being required to go
to another hospital for a similar load, had had to deposit them
outside. It was a grim reminder of the brisk business Death was
doing amongst the enteric wards.</p>

<p>In course of time the pretty burial-ground was filled to
overflowing. There were long trenches in which the dead were laid
in layers. A separate grave was a luxury to which none but an
officer might aspire. And before very long the trenches were being
dug in the veldt without the town.</p>

<p>Ride up the Modder and track the march of the army by the
graves. Note the little mounds along the advance to Pretoria.
Chance on quiet beautiful places like Nitral's Nek, and find them
sown with dead men. Everywhere there are dead men. It is as if the
whole country were soaked in blood, and planted with little wooden
crosses. Truly, it is 'an unhappy land'.</p>

<p>Now, if you consider all these matters of graves, and burned
farmhouses, and how very greatly women influence the lives of men
in their capacity of motherhood, you will see quite plainly what an
exceptionally curious state of mind South Africa must be in at
present, and how difficult it is for any one to predict what the
finality of it all may ultimately be.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a somewhat spoiled and wilful child, strongly
desirous of doing or obtaining something which is not good for him
(there are so many things), finally restrained from the attainment
of his end by sheer physical fear? The moment authority relaxes,
the instant the back of the power that overawes him is turned, you
may feel quite certain that he will attempt the fulfilment of his
wish. In the meantime, while he is watched and guarded, and because
he dare not do as he would, he has an attitude of sulky
acquiescence&mdash;he is sullen. There you have a simile that may
stand for the mental state of the people of the two late Republics,
and for their kinsmen of the Cape Colony as well. And there, too,
you have the great difficulty of future government in South
Africa.</p>

<p>We have taken the country again. We are about to rule it again,
and as we rule it so will it prosper. One does not use the word
'prosper' to signify that there will be a larger output of gold
from the Rand, or that the De Beers Company will get bigger
dividends out of Kimberley, but that the country may become a
country of good citizenship, of healthy public spirit, of
fellowship of the two almost kindred races which will have to live
together in it. And, to this end, we must be firm yet kind, strong
but gentle, just if stern&mdash;but, above all, consistent in our
dealings with these people from whom we have taken their nationhood
in open fight.</p>

<p>We have the mistakes that brought about the Great Trek, and the
humiliations of '81 and '99, to guide us towards better
things&mdash;to show us, at the least, 'the way not to do it'. And
if you know that, the rest is not so very difficult of
attainment&mdash;only, you must first of all know that. Before
everything, one thinks, the watchword should be 'consistency'.</p>

<p>And what a hope there is for a new, a 'reconstructed' South
Africa! Blood has been spilt as water, treasure scattered lavishly
as lucerne seed, brain energy dissipated as a spendthrift's money.
Are we not to have a return? To those of us who have seen the
misery of the country as it is to-day&mdash;the empty void the war
has made of it&mdash;it seems impossible that there can be any
blacker depth to reach. The tide has sunk to its lowest ebb. Of the
very nature of things it must soon begin to rise again. In the
earlier chapters of this book, the writer has hazarded it as his
insignificant opinion that the country is a good one&mdash;he is
even doubtful whether, if the matter were to be fully considered by
people more competent of judging its merits than he is, it might
not almost be ranked, for many purposes, as a better one than
Australia. It is, as has been said before, even as a field that has
been uncultivated. It has its disadvantages and drawbacks, but one
is very doubtful, indeed, whether it has so many or such appalling
ones as we have encountered and overcome here, or as confront us
even now. It has a soil that is, best for best, as good, and it has
a rainfall that is better. So, let our <i>châteaux d'Afrique</i> be
pleasant ones if we may do so. After having seen the poor rent and
riven land wallowing in such depths of misery as it has lain in, it
is at least a cheerfully optimistic feeling to possess about it
'that there is a good time coming' for the Cape, the Orange River
Colony and the Transvaal. They will surely need it to compensate
for the bad one they have had. Let us hope, therefore, that out of
much evil there will come good for South Africa, that, in the
future, one may think of her less sadly than in the
present&mdash;that in the end she may be 'a happy land'.</p>

<p>To us of Australia this has been the first experience of war.
Far away from the complications of European politics, we have been
permitted, for the century or so of our existence, to develop our
country upon peaceful lines, and beyond, 'for the look of the
thing,' mounting obsolete artillery at a few points along our
shores, where no one is ever likely to attempt to invade us, we
have not thought it worth our while to give overmuch attention, in
a serious way at any rate, to the possible contingency of having to
fight for our country, in just as desperate and bloody a fashion as
the Boers have had to fight for theirs.</p>

<p>But we are nearer to the centre of the whirlwind now than we
were in '54&mdash;just a little nearer than we were in '85. And
though, knowing now what W-A-R spells, one has the devout and
fervent hope that we may never more fully realise the significance
of the word in our own good land, it is absolutely necessary, for
the sake of our existence as the Nation which we became a few
months ago, that we should be at all times fully competent to
maintain our position in the wider arena within which peoples and
races shape their destinies in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>If the reader shall have done the writer the honour of wading
through these pages of chaotic scribbling so far as this one, the
latter is not going to take any mean advantage of him by seeking to
inflict his views as to the superiority of Mounted Infantry to
Cavalry, the moral effect of quick-firing guns and the mobility of
artillery, or the faults of present systems of military
organisation and equipment upon him. Many more competent, and many
quite as incompetent people have already laid the law down as to
all manner of military matters. It is easy to criticise, as has
been before remarked with regard to the Hospitals, but very hard to
suggest reasonably.</p>

<p>But, if he may be permitted here, in the last pages of his book,
to point out one obvious lesson that may be drawn for Australia
from the history of the English struggle with the Boers, he would
very much like to set it forth. Without overmuch wearisome preamble
it may be suggested by the one word&mdash;<i>Ammunition</i>.</p>

<p>If we have cartridges we have men who can use them effectively;
but if we have none, then we are 'a gift' to the first hostile
Power who may seek to take us.</p>

<p>So, this is the lone suggestion which the writer ventures to
make, knowing that he is too ignorant and impracticable to fully
elaborate the scheme. That we build ourselves a small-arm
ammunition factory somewhere by the Canoblas, and make some
cartridges, and keep on making them, until we have so many millions
that we may afford to bury them in handy places about the country,
after the manner of Christian De Wet and other gifted Generals who
know what they are about, and whose heads are 'screwed on the right
way'. And then, when the Great War comes suddenly (as it will come
when it does come), we shall feel safe, and happy, and content to
rely upon ourselves, even though all those slim, untried ships in
Farm Cove strew the beaches from Byron Bay to Gabo.</p>

<p>Of course, we need rifles also&mdash;plenty of them&mdash;and
would be all the better off did we make them, too&mdash;but we
should have, first and above all, enough cartridges to make our
supply inexhaustible, and the means of keeping it so when we shall
have been cut off from English importations. Cannon, also, and
shells, we might make&mdash;but that is too vast a dream, perhaps;
and, after all, if we have cartridges and rifles, and men who know
how to shoot, we may laugh at all the 'shrapnel' and 'common-shell'
that were ever made for Krupp or Creusot guns. While we can arm
such men as those who defied De la Rey at Eland's River we need
have little fear for the safety of our country, but if we cannot
arm them, and keep them supplied with ammunition for their arms, we
might as well attach ourselves to whatever Power we may consider
likely to be 'top dog' in the event of the overthrow of England. We
have been very ready to assist her. It might be as well to make
sure that we can help ourselves. We don't want uniform factories,
or gold lace contractors, but we cannot do without cartridges.</p>

<p>And now we come to the end. The suns rise and set over the grey
fields and the blue kopjes out there across the Indian Ocean, and
the glorious days of the 'high veldt' are as divinely blue and
clear as ever they were for us. The same dirty, yellow-coated men
loaf about the streets of the quiet stads and dorps; the same dingy
guns still point menacingly half skyward; the same steady rifles
still rest over ant heaps and rocks; the same long trains puff
slowly over the Karoo towards De Aar and Naauwpoort. But the end of
it is in sight. The guns and the rifles will point, and the
provision trains crawl about the country for a while longer. In a
year or more the rifles will be carried at the 'shoulder' instead
of at the 'ready'&mdash;in God's own time they will be laid down,
and there will come the five-furrowed plough amongst the graves,
and the noise of the stamper battery will supersede the noise of
the field-battery. For us who have come back, the end is here.
Black coat or shirt-sleeves instead of khaki&mdash;stock-whip and
shear-blade instead of rifle. Cattle or sheep to herd instead of
worn-out horses&mdash;prospecting drives to dig instead of
trenches. Kangaroos to hunt instead of men.</p>

<p>Some of us have 'gone drovin',' some of us have 'humped bluey'.
Most of us have 'roughed it' somewhere in Australia at some
time&mdash;but none of us as we did in Africa.</p>

<p>And yet there was something about it all that calls you back
again&mdash;some devilish fascination in the life of war-time that
will never leave you without a hankering for more of it. "There is
no hunting like the hunting of man!"</p>

<p>The end for us is the drafting-yard, and the farm in the river
bend, and the shearing floor, and the stripped saddle of peaceful
avocation, and the office. The end for Africa is yet to shape
itself. But the days of war, in spite of what he might have thought
at the time&mdash;in spite of whatever may become of him in the
after years&mdash;will always return with something of indefinable
pleasure in their remembrance to 'Tommy Cornstalk'.</p>
