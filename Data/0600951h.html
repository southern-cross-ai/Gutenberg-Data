<h2><a id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="verse" style="margin-left:33%">
Into the west, unknown of man,<br>
Ships have sailed since the world began.<br>
Read, if you dare, what Skelos wrote,<br>
With dead hands fumbling his silken coat;<br>
And follow the ships through the wind-blown wrack&mdash;<br>
Follow the ships that come not back.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">SANCHA, once of Kordava, yawned daintily,
stretched her supple limbs luxuriously, and composed herself more
comfortably on the ermine-fringed silk spread on the carack's
poop-deck. That the crew watched her with burning interest from
waist and forecastle she was lazily aware, just as she was also
aware that her short silk kirtle veiled little of her voluptuous
contours from their eager eyes. Wherefore she smiled insolently and
prepared to snatch a few more winks before the sun, which was just
thrusting his golden disk above the ocean, should dazzle her
eyes.</p>

<p>But at that instant a sound reached her ears unlike the creaking
of timbers, thrum of cordage and lap of waves. She sat up, her gaze
fixed on the rail, over which, to her amazement, a dripping figure
clambered. Her dark eyes opened wide, her red lips parted in an O
of surprise. The intruder was a stranger to her. Water ran in
rivulets from his great shoulders and down his heavy arms. His
single garment&mdash;a pair of bright crimson silk breeks&mdash;was
soaking wet, as was his broad gold-buckled girdle and the sheathed
sword it supported. As he stood at the rail, the rising sun etched
him like a great bronze statue. He ran his fingers through his
streaming black mane, and his blue eyes lit as they rested on the
girl.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she demanded. "Whence did you come?"</p>

<p>He made a gesture toward the sea that took in a whole quarter of
the compass, while his eyes did not leave her supple figure.</p>

<p>"Are you a merman, that you rise up out of the sea?" she asked,
confused by the candor of his gaze, though she was accustomed to
admiration.</p>

<p>Before he could reply, a quick step sounded on the boards, and
the master of the carack was glaring at the stranger, fingers
twitching at sword-hilt.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you, sirrah?" this one demanded in no
friendly tone.</p>

<p>"I am Conan," the other answered imperturbably. Sancha pricked
up her ears anew; she had never heard Zingaran spoken with such an
accent as the stranger spoke it.</p>

<p>"And how did you get aboard my ship?" The voice grated with
suspicion.</p>

<p>"I swam."</p>

<p>"Swam!" exclaimed the master angrily. "Dog, would you jest with
me? We are far beyond sight of land. Whence do you come?"</p>

<p>Conan pointed with a muscular brown arm toward the east, banded
in dazzling gold by the lifting sun.</p>

<p>"I came from the Islands."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The other regarded him with increased interest. Black
brows drew down over scowling eyes, and the thin lip lifted
unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"So you are one of those dogs of the Barachans."</p>

<p>A faint smile touched Conan's lips.</p>

<p>"And do you know who I am?" his questioner demanded.</p>

<p>"This ship is the Wastrel; so you must be Zaporavo."</p>

<p>"Aye!" It touched the captain's grim vanity that the man should
know him. He was a tall man, tall as Conan, though of leaner build.
Framed in his steel morion his face was dark, saturnine and
hawk-like, wherefore men called him the Hawk. His armor and
garments were rich and ornate, after the fashion of a Zingaran
grandee. His hand was never far from his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>There was little favor in the gaze he bent on Conan. Little love
was lost between Zingaran renegades and the outlaws who infested
the Baracha Islands off the southern coast of Zingara. These men
were mostly sailors from Argos, with a sprinkling of other
nationalities. They raided the shipping, and harried the Zingaran
coast towns, just as the Zingaran buccaneers did, but these
dignified their profession by calling themselves Freebooters, while
they dubbed the Barachans pirates. They were neither the first nor
the last to gild the name of thief.</p>

<p>Some of these thoughts passed through Zaporavo's mind as he
toyed with his sword-hilt and scowled at his uninvited guest. Conan
gave no hint of what his own thoughts might be. He stood with
folded arms as placidly as if upon his own deck; his lips smiled
and his eyes were untroubled.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" the Freebooter demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>"I found it necessary to leave the rendezvous at Tortage before
moonrise last night," answered Conan. "I departed in a leaky boat,
and rowed and bailed all night. Just at dawn I saw your topsails,
and left the miserable tub to sink, while I made better speed in
the water."</p>

<p>"There are sharks in these waters," growled Zaporavo, and was
vaguely irritated by the answering shrug of the mighty shoulders. A
glance toward the waist showed a screen of eager faces staring
upward. A word would send them leaping up on the poop in a storm of
swords that would overwhelm even such a fighting man as the
stranger looked to be.</p>

<p>"Why should I burden myself with every nameless vagabond that
the sea casts up?" snarled Zaporavo, his look and manner more
insulting than his words.</p>

<p>"A ship can always use another good sailor," answered the other
without resentment. Zaporavo scowled, knowing the truth of that
assertion. He hesitated, and doing so, lost his ship, his command,
his girl, and his life. But of course he could not see into the
future, and to him Conan was only another wastrel, cast up, as he
put it, by the sea. He did not like the man; yet the fellow had
given him no provocation. His manner was not insolent, though
rather more confident than Zaporavo liked to see.</p>

<p>"You'll work for your keep," snarled the Hawk. "Get off the
poop. And remember, the only law here is my will."</p>

<p><br>
THE smile seemed to broaden on Conan's thin lips. Without
hesitation but without haste he turned and descended into the
waist. He did not look again at Sancha, who, during the brief
conversation, had watched eagerly, all eyes and ears.</p>

<p>As he came into the waist the crew thronged about him:
Zingarans, all of them, half naked, their gaudy silk garments
splashed with tar, jewels glinting in ear-rings and dagger-hilts.
They were eager for the time-honored sport of baiting the stranger.
Here he would be tested, and his future status in the crew decided.
Up on the poop Zaporavo had apparently already forgotten the
stranger's existence, but Sancha watched, tense with interest. She
had become familiar with such scenes, and knew the baiting would be
brutal and probably bloody.</p>

<p>But her familiarity with such matters was scanty compared to
that of Conan. He smiled faintly as he came into the waist and saw
the menacing figures pressing truculently about him. He paused and
eyed the ring inscrutably, his composure unshaken. There was a
certain code about these things. If he had attacked the captain,
the whole crew would have been at his throat, but they would give
him a fair chance against the one selected to push the brawl.</p>

<p>The man chosen for this duty thrust himself forward&mdash;a wiry
brute, with a crimson sash knotted about his head like a turban.
His lean chin jutted out, his scarred face was evil beyond belief.
Every glance, each swaggering movement was an affront. His way of
beginning the baiting was as primitive, raw and crude as
himself.</p>

<p>"Baracha, eh?" he sneered. "That's where they raise dogs for
men. We of the Fellowship spit on 'em&mdash;like this!"</p>

<p>He spat in Conan's face and snatched at his own sword.</p>

<p>The Barachan's movement was too quick for the eye to follow. His
sledge- like fist crunched with a terrible impact against his
tormentor's jaw, and the Zingaran catapulted through the air and
fell in a crumpled heap by the rail.</p>

<p>Conan turned towards the others. But for a slumbering glitter in
his eyes, his bearing was unchanged. But the baiting was over as
suddenly as it had begun. The seamen lifted their companion; his
broken jaw hung slack, his head lolled unnaturally.</p>

<p>"By Mitra, his neck's broken!" swore a black-bearded
sea-rogue.</p>

<p>"You Freebooters are a weak-boned race," laughed the pirate. "On
the Barachas we take no account of such taps as that. Will you play
at sword- strokes, now, any of you? No? Then all's well, and we're
friends, eh?"</p>

<p>There were plenty of tongues to assure him that he spoke truth.
Brawny arms swung the dead man over the rail, and a dozen fins cut
the water as he sank. Conan laughed and spread his mighty arms as a
great cat might stretch itself, and his gaze sought the deck above.
Sancha leaned over the rail, red lips parted, dark eyes aglow with
interest. The sun behind her outlined her lithe figure through the
light kirtle which its glow made transparent. Then across her fell
Zaporavo's scowling shadow and a heavy hand fell possessively on
her slim shoulder. There were menace and meaning in the glare he
bent on the man in the waist; Conan grinned back, as if at a jest
none knew but himself.</p>

<p>Zaporavo made the mistake so many autocrats make; alone in
somber grandeur on the poop, he underestimated the man below him.
He had his opportunity to kill Conan, and he let it pass, engrossed
in his own gloomy ruminations. He did not find it easy to think any
of the dogs beneath his feet constituted a menace to him. He had
stood in the high places so long, and had ground so many foes
underfoot, that he unconsciously assumed himself to be above the
machinations of inferior rivals.</p>

<p>Conan, indeed, gave him no provocation. He mixed with the crew,
lived and made merry as they did. He proved himself a skilled
sailor, and by far the strongest man any of them had seen. He did
the work of three men, and was always first to spring to any heavy
or dangerous task. His mates began to rely upon him. He did not
quarrel with them, and they were careful not to quarrel with him.
He gambled with them, putting up his girdle and sheath for a stake,
won their money and weapons, and gave them back with a laugh. The
crew instinctively looked toward him as the leader of the
forecastle. He vouchsafed no information as to what had caused him
to flee the Barachas, but the knowledge that he was capable of a
deed bloody enough to have exiled him from that wild band increased
the respect felt toward him by the fierce Freebooters. Toward
Zaporavo and the mates he was imperturbably courteous, never
insolent or servile.</p>

<p>The dullest was struck by the contrast between the harsh,
taciturn, gloomy commander, and the pirate whose laugh was gusty
and ready, who roared ribald songs in a dozen languages, guzzled
ale like a toper, and&mdash;apparently&mdash;had no thought for the
morrow.</p>

<p><br>
HAD Zaporavo known he was being compared, even though
unconsciously, with a man before the mast, he would have been
speechless with amazed anger. But he was engrossed with his
broodings, which had become blacker and grimmer as the years
crawled by, and with his vague grandiose dreams; and with the girl
whose possession was a bitter pleasure, just as all his pleasures
were.</p>

<p>And she looked more and more at the black-maned giant who
towered among his mates at work or play. He never spoke to her, but
there was no mistaking the candor of his gaze. She did not mistake
it, and she wondered if she dared the perilous game of leading him
on.</p>

<p>No great length of time lay between her and the palaces of
Kordava, but it was as if a world of change separated her from the
life she had lived before Zaporavo tore her screaming from the
flaming caravel his wolves had plundered. She, who had been the
spoiled and petted daughter of the Duke of Kordava, learned what it
was to be a buccaneer's plaything, and because she was supple
enough to bend without breaking, she lived where other women had
died, and because she was young and vibrant with life, she came to
find pleasure in the existence.</p>

<p>The life was uncertain, dream-like, with sharp contrasts of
battle, pillage, murder, and flight. Zaporavo's red visions made it
even more uncertain than that of the average Freebooter. No one
knew what he planned next. Now they had left all charted coasts
behind and were plunging further and further into that unknown
billowy waste ordinarily shunned by seafarers, and into which,
since the beginnings of Time, ships had ventured, only to vanish
from the sight of man for ever. All known lands lay behind them,
and day upon day the blue surging immensity lay empty to their
sight. Here there was no loot&mdash;no towns to sack nor ships to
burn. The men murmured, though they did not let their murmurings
reach the ears of their implacable master, who tramped the poop day
and night in gloomy majesty, or pored over ancient charts and time-
yellowed maps, reading in tomes that were crumbling masses of
worm-eaten parchment. At times he talked to Sancha, wildly it
seemed to her, of lost continents, and fabulous isles dreaming
unguessed amidst the blue foam of nameless gulfs, where horned
dragons guarded treasures gathered by pre-human kings, long, long
ago.</p>

<p>Sancha listened, uncomprehending, hugging her slim knees, her
thoughts constantly roving away from the words of her grim
companion back to a clean- limbed bronze giant whose laughter was
gusty and elemental as the sea wind.</p>

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>So, after many weary weeks, they raised land to westward, and at
dawn dropped anchor in a shallow bay, and saw a beach which was
like a white band bordering an expanse of gently grassy slopes,
masked by green trees. The wind brought scents of fresh vegetation
and spices, and Sancha clapped her hands with glee at the prospect
of adventuring ashore. But her eagerness turned to sulkiness when
Zaporavo ordered her to remain aboard until he sent for her. He
never gave any explanation for his commands; so she never knew his
reason, unless it was the lurking devil in him that frequently made
him hurt her without cause.</p>

<p>So she lounged sulkily on the poop and watched the men row
ashore through the calm water that sparkled like liquid jade in the
morning sunlight. She saw them bunch together on the sands,
suspicious, weapons ready, while several scattered out through the
trees that fringed the beach. Among these, she noted, was Conan.
There was no mistaking that tall brown figure with its springy
step. Men said he was no civilized man at all, but a Cimmerian, one
of those barbaric tribesmen who dwelt in the gray hills of the far
North, and whose raids struck terror in their southern neighbors.
At least, she knew that there was something about him, some
super-vitality or barbarism that set him apart from his wild
mates.</p>

<p>Voices echoed along the shore, as the silence reassured the
buccaneers. The clusters broke up, as men scattered along the beach
in search of fruit. She saw them climbing and plucking among the
trees, and her pretty mouth watered. She stamped a little foot and
swore with a proficiency acquired by association with her
blasphemous companions.</p>

<p>The men on shore had indeed found fruit, and were gorging on it,
finding one unknown golden-skinned variety especially luscious. But
Zaporavo did not seek or eat fruit. His scouts having found nothing
indicating men or beasts in the neighborhood, he stood staring
inland, at the long reaches of grassy slopes melting into one
another. Then, with a brief word, he shifted his sword-belt and
strode in under the trees. His mate expostulated with him against
going alone, and was rewarded by a savage blow in the mouth.
Zaporavo had his reasons for wishing to go alone. He desired to
learn if this island were indeed that mentioned in the mysterious
Book of Skelos, whereon, nameless sages aver, strange monsters
guard crypts filled with hieroglyph-carven gold. Nor, for murky
reasons of his own, did he wish to share his knowledge, if it were
true, with any one, much less his own crew.</p>

<p>Sancha, watching eagerly from the poop, saw him vanish into the
leafy fastness. Presently she saw Conan, the Barachan, turn, glance
briefly at the men scattered up and down the beach; then the pirate
went quickly in the direction taken by Zaporavo, and likewise
vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>Sancha's curiosity was piqued. She waited for them to reappear,
but they did not. The seamen still moved aimlessly up and down the
beach, and some had wandered inland. Many had lain down in the
shade to sleep. Time passed and she fidgeted about restlessly. The
sun began to beat down hotly, in spite of the canopy above the
poop-deck. Here it was warm, silent, draggingly monotonous; a few
yards away across a band of blue shallow water, the cool shady
mystery of tree-fringed beach and woodland-dotted meadow beckoned
her. Moreover, the mystery concerning Zaporavo and Conan tempted
her.</p>

<p>She well knew the penalty for disobeying her merciless master,
and she sat for some time, squirming with indecision. At last she
decided that it was worth even one of Zaporavo's whippings to play
truant, and with no more ado she kicked off her soft leather
sandals, slipped out of her kirtle and stood up on the deck naked
as Eve. Clambering over the rail and down the chains, she slid into
the water and swam ashore. She stood on the beach a few moments,
squirming as the sands tickled her small toes, while she looked for
the crew. She saw only a few, at some distance up or down the
beach. Many were fast asleep under the trees, bits of golden fruit
still clutched in their fingers. She wondered why they should sleep
so soundly, so early in the day.</p>

<p><br>
NONE hailed her as she crossed the white girdle of sand and
entered the shade of the woodland. The trees, she found, grew in
irregular clusters, and between these groves stretched rolling
expanses of meadow-like slopes. As she progressed inland, in the
direction taken by Zaporavo, she was entranced by the green vistas
that unfolded gently before her, soft slope beyond slope, carpeted
with green sward and dotted with groves. Between the slopes lay
gentle declivities, likewise swarded. The scenery seemed to melt
into itself, or each scene into the other; the view was singular,
at once broad and restricted. Over all a dreamy silence lay like an
enchantment.</p>

<p>Then she came suddenly onto the level summit of a slope, circled
with tall trees, and the dreamily faery-like sensation vanished
abruptly at the sight of what lay on the reddened and trampled
grass. Sancha involuntarily cried out and recoiled, then stole
forward, wide-eyed, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>It was Zaporavo who lay there on the sward, staring sightlessly
upward, a gaping wound in his breast. His sword lay near his
nerveless hand. The Hawk had made his last swoop.</p>

<p>It is not to be said that Sancha gazed on the corpse of her lord
without emotion. She had no cause to love him, yet she felt at
least the sensation any girl might feel when looking on the body of
the man who was first to possess her. She did not weep or feel any
need of weeping, but she was seized by a strong trembling, her
blood seemed to congeal briefly, and she resisted a wave of
hysteria.</p>

<p>She looked about her for the man she expected to see. Nothing
met her eyes but the ring of tall, thickly leafed forest giants,
and the blue slopes beyond them. Had the Freebooter's slayer
dragged himself away, mortally wounded? No bloody tracks led away
from the body.</p>

<p>Puzzled, she swept the surrounding trees, stiffening as she
caught a rustle in the emerald leaves that seemed not to be of the
wind. She went toward the trees, staring into the leafy depths.</p>

<p>"Conan?" Her call was inquiring; her voice sounded strange and
small in the vastness of silence that had grown suddenly tense.</p>

<p>Her knees began to tremble as a nameless panic swept over
her.</p>

<p>"Conan!" she cried desperately. "It is I&mdash;Sancha! Where are
you? Please, Conan&mdash;" Her voice faltered away. Unbelieving
horror dilated her brown eyes. Her red lips parted to an
inarticulate scream. Paralysis gripped her limbs; where she had
such desperate need of swift flight, she could not move. She could
only shriek wordlessly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Conan saw Zaporavo stalk alone into the
woodland, he felt that the chance he had watched for had come. He
had eaten no fruit, nor joined in the horse-play of his mates; all
his faculties were occupied with watching the buccaneer chief.
Accustomed to Zaporavo's moods, his men were not particularly
surprised that their captain should choose to explore an unknown
and probably hostile isle alone. They turned to their own
amusement, and did not notice Conan when he glided like a stalking
panther after the chieftain.</p>

<p>Conan did not underrate his dominance of the crew. But he had
not gained the right, through battle and foray, to challenge the
captain to a duel to the death. In these empty seas there had been
no opportunity for him to prove himself according to Freebooter
law. The crew would stand solidly against him if he attacked the
chieftain openly. But he knew that if he killed Zaporavo without
their knowledge, the leaderless crew would not be likely to be
swayed by loyalty to a dead man. In such wolf-packs only the living
counted.</p>

<p>So he followed Zaporavo with sword in hand and eagerness in his
heart, until he came out onto a level summit, circled with tall
trees, between whose trunks he saw the green vistas of the slopes
melting into the blue distance. In the midst of the glade Zaporavo,
sensing pursuit, turned, hand on hilt.</p>

<p>The buccaneer swore.</p>

<p>"Dog, why do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Are you mad, to ask?" laughed Conan, coming swiftly toward his
erstwhile chief. His lips smiled, and in his blue eyes danced a
wild gleam.</p>

<p>Zaporavo ripped out his sword with a black curse, and steel
clashed against steel as the Barachan came in recklessly and wide
open, his blade singing a wheel of blue flame about his head.</p>

<p>Zaporavo was the veteran of a thousand fights by sea and by
land. There was no man in the world more deeply and thoroughly
versed than he in the lore of swordcraft. But he had never been
pitted against a blade wielded by thews bred in the wild lands
beyond the borders of civilization. Against his fighting- craft was
matched blinding speed and strength impossible to a civilized man.
Conan's manner of fighting was unorthodox, but instinctive and
natural as that of a timber wolf. The intricacies of the sword were
as useless against his primitive fury as a human boxer's skill
against the onslaughts of a panther.</p>

<p>Fighting as he had never fought before, straining every last
ounce of effort to parry the blade that flickered like lightning
about his head, Zaporavo in desperation caught a full stroke near
his hilt, and felt his whole arm go numb beneath the terrific
impact. That stroke was instantly followed by a thrust with such
terrible drive behind it that the sharp point ripped through
chain-mail and ribs like paper, to transfix the heart beneath.
Zaporavo's lips writhed in brief agony, but, grim to the last, he
made no sound. He was dead before his body relaxed on the trampled
grass, where blood drops glittered like spilt rubies in the
sun.</p>

<p>Conan shook the red drops from his sword, grinned with
unaffected pleasure, stretched like a huge cat&mdash;and abruptly
stiffened, the expression of satisfaction on his face being
replaced by a stare of bewilderment. He stood like a statue, his
sword trailing in his hand.</p>

<p>As he lifted his eyes from his vanquished foe, they had absently
rested on the surrounding trees, and the vistas beyond. And he had
seen a fantastic thing&mdash;a thing incredible and inexplicable.
Over the soft rounded green shoulder of a distant slope had loped a
tall black naked figure, bearing on its shoulder an equally naked
white form. The apparition vanished as suddenly as it had appeared,
leaving the watcher gasping in surprise.</p>

<p>The pirate stared about him, glanced uncertainly back the way he
had come, and swore. He was nonplussed&mdash;a bit upset, if the
term might be applied to one of such steely nerves as his. In the
midst of realistic, if exotic surroundings, a vagrant image of
fantasy and nightmare had been introduced. Conan doubted neither
his eyesight nor his sanity. He had seen something alien and
uncanny, he knew; the mere fact of a black figure racing across the
landscape carrying a white captive was bizarre enough, but this
black figure had been unnaturally tall.</p>

<p>Shaking his head doubtfully, Conan started off in the direction
in which he had seen the thing. He did not argue the wisdom of his
move; with his curiosity so piqued, he had no choice but to follow
its promptings.</p>

<p>Slope after slope he traversed, each with its even sward and
clustered groves. The general trend was always upward, though he
ascended and descended the gentle inclines with monotonous
regularity. The array of rounded shoulders and shallow declivities
was bewildering and apparently endless. But at last he advanced up
what he believed was the highest summit on the island, and halted
at the sight of green shining walls and towers, which, until he had
reached the spot on which he then stood, had merged so perfectly
with the green landscape as to be invisible, even to his keen
sight.</p>

<p>He hesitated, fingered his sword, then went forward, bitten by
the worm of curiosity. He saw no one as he approached a tall
archway in the curving wall. There was no door. Peering warily
through, he saw what seemed to be a broad open court,
grass-carpeted, surrounded by a circular wall of the green
semitranslucent substance. Various arches opened from it. Advancing
on the balls of his bare feet, sword ready, he chose one of these
arches at random, and passed into another similar court. Over an
inner wall he saw the pinnacles of strangely shaped towerlike
structures. One of these towers was built in, or projected into the
court in which he found himself, and a broad stair led up to it,
along the side of the wall. Up this he went, wondering if it were
all real, or if he were not in the midst of a black lotus
dream.</p>

<p>At the head of the stair he found himself on a walled ledge, or
balcony, he was not sure which. He could now make out more details
of the towers, but they were meaningless to him. He realised
uneasily that no ordinary human beings could have built them. There
was symmetry about their architecture, and system, but it was a mad
symmetry, a system alien to human sanity. As for the plan of the
whole town, castle, or whatever it was intended for, he could see
just enough to get the impression of a great number of courts,
mostly circular, each surrounded by its own wall, and connected
with the others by open arches, and all, apparently, grouped about
the cluster of fantastic towers in the center.</p>

<p>Turning in the other direction from these towers, he got a
fearful shock, and crouched down suddenly behind the parapet of the
balcony, glaring amazedly.</p>

<p>The balcony or ledge was higher than the opposite wall, and he
was looking over that wall into another swarded court. The inner
curve of the further wall of that court differed from the others he
had seen, in that, instead of being smooth, it seemed to be banded
with long lines or ledges, crowded with small objects the nature of
which he could not determine.</p>

<p>However, he gave little heed to the wall at the time. His
attention was centered on the band of beings that squatted about a
dark green pool in the midst of the court. These creatures were
black and naked, made like men, but the least of them, standing
upright, would have towered head and shoulders above the tall
pirate. They were rangy rather than massive, but were finely
formed, with no suggestion of deformity or abnomality, save as
their great height was abnormal. But even at that distance Conan
sensed the basic diabolism of their features.</p>

<p>In their midst, cringing and naked, stood a youth that Conan
recognised as the youngest sailor aboard the Wastrel. He, then, had
been the captive the pirate had seen borne across the grass-covered
slope. Conan had heard no sound of fighting&mdash;saw no
blood-stains or wounds on the sleek ebon limbs of the giants.
Evidently the lad had wandered inland away from his companions and
been snatched up by a black man lurking in ambush. Conan mentally
termed the creatures black men, for lack of a better term;
instinctively he knew that these tall ebony beings were not men, as
he understood the term.</p>

<p>No sound came to him. The blacks nodded and gestured to one
another, but they did not seem to speak&mdash;vocally, at least.
One, squatting on his haunches before the cringing boy, held a
pipe-like thing in his hand. This he set to his lips, and
apparently blew, though Conan heard no sound. But the Zingaran
youth heard or felt, and cringed. He quivered and writhed as if in
agony; a regularity became evident in the twitching of his limbs,
which quickly became rhythmic. The twitching became a violent
jerking, the jerking regular movements. The youth began to dance,
as cobras dance by compulsion to the tune of the faquir's fife.
There was naught of zest or joyful abandon in that dance. There
was, indeed, abandon that was awful to see, but it was not joyful.
It was as if the mute tune of the pipes grasped the boy's inmost
soul with salacious fingers and with brutal torture wrung from it
every involuntary expression of secret passion. It was a convulsion
of obscenity, a spasm of lasciviousness&mdash;an exudation of
secret hungers framed by compulsion: desire without pleasure, pain
mated awfully to lust. It was like watching a soul stripped naked,
and all its dark and unmentionable secrets laid bare.</p>

<p>Conan glared frozen with repulsion and shaken with nausea.
Himself as cleanly elemental as a timber wolf, he was yet not
ignorant of the perverse secrets of rotting civilizations. He had
roamed the cities of Zamora, and known the women of Shadizar the
Wicked. But he sensed here a cosmic vileness transcending mere
human degeneracy&mdash;a perverse branch on the tree of Life,
developed along lines outside human comprehension. It was not at
the agonized contortions and posturing of the wretched boy that he
was shocked, but at the cosmic obscenity of these beings which
could drag to light the abysmal secrets that sleep in the
unfathomed darkness of the human soul, and find pleasure in the
brazen flaunting of such things as should not be hinted at, even in
restless nightmares.</p>

<p>Suddenly the black torturer laid down the pipes and rose,
towering over the writhing white figure. Brutally grasping the boy
by neck and haunch, the giant up-ended him and thrust him
head-first into the green pool. Conan saw the white glimmer of his
naked body amid the green water, as the black giant held his
captive deep under the surface. Then there was a restless movement
among the other blacks, and Conan ducked quickly below the balcony
wall, not daring to raise his head lest he be seen.</p>

<p><br>
AFTER a while his curiosity got the better of him, and he
cautiously peered out again. The blacks were filing out of an
archway into another court. One of them was just placing something
on a ledge of the further wall, and Conan saw it was the one who
had tortured the boy. He was taller than the others, and wore a
jeweled head-band. Of the Zingaran boy there was no trace. The
giant followed his fellows, and presently Conan saw them emerge
from the archway by which he had gained access to that castle of
horror, and file away across the green slopes, in the direction
from which he had come. They bore no arms, yet he felt that they
planned further aggression against the Freebooters.</p>

<p>But before he went to warn the unsuspecting buccaneers, he
wished to investigate the fate of the boy. No sound disturbed the
quiet. The pirate believed that the towers and courts were deserted
save for himself.</p>

<p>He went swiftly down the stair, crossed the court and passed
through an arch into the court the blacks had just quitted. Now he
saw the nature of the striated wall. It was banded by narrow
ledges, apparently cut out of the solid stone, and ranged along
these ledges or shelves were thousands of tiny figures, mostly
grayish in color. These figures, not much longer than a man's hand,
represented men, and so cleverly were they made that Conan
recognised various racial characteristics in the different idols,
features typical of Zingarans, Argosseans, Ophireans and Kushite
corsairs. These last were black in color, just as their models were
black in reality. Conan was aware of a vague uneasiness as he
stared at the dumb sightless figures. There was a mimicry of
reality about them that was somehow disturbing. He felt of them
gingerly and could not decide of what material they were made. It
felt like petrified bone; but he could not imagine petrified
substance being found in the locality in such abundance as to be
used so lavishly.</p>

<p>He noticed that the images representing types with which he was
familiar were all on the higher ledges. The lower ledges were
occupied by figures the features of which were strange to him. They
either embodied merely the artists' imagination, or typified racial
types long vanished and forgotten.</p>

<p>Shaking his head impatiently, Conan turned toward the pool. The
circular court offered no place of concealment; as the body of the
boy was nowhere in sight, it must be lying at the bottom of the
pool.</p>

<p>Approaching the placid green disk, he stared into the glimmering
surface. It was like looking through a thick green glass,
unclouded, yet strangely illusory. Of no great dimensions, the pool
was round as a well, bordered by a rim of green jade. Looking down
he could see the rounded bottom&mdash;how far below the surface he
could not decide. But the pool seemed incredibly deep&mdash;he was
aware of a dizziness as he looked down, much as if he were looking
into an abyss. He was puzzled by his ability to see the bottom; but
it lay beneath his gaze, impossibly remote, illusive, shadowy, yet
visible. At times he thought a faint luminosity was apparent deep
in the jade-colored depth, but he could not be sure. Yet he was
sure that the pool was empty except for the shimmering water.</p>

<p>Then where in the name of Crom was the boy whom he had seen
brutally drowned in that pool? Rising, Conan fingered his sword,
and gazed around the court again. His gaze focused on a spot on one
of the higher ledges. There he had seen the tall black place
something&mdash;cold sweat broke suddenly out on Conan's brown
hide.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, yet as if drawn by a magnet, the pirate approached
the shimmering wall. Dazed by a suspicion too monstrous to voice,
he glared up at the last figure on that ledge. A horrible
familiarity made itself evident. Stony, immobile, dwarfish, yet
unmistakable, the features of the Zingaran boy stared unseeingly at
him. Conan recoiled, shaken to his soul's foundations. His sword
trailed in his paralyzed hand as he glared, open-mouthed, stunned
by the realization which was too abysmal and awful for the mind to
grasp.</p>

<p>Yet the fact was indisputable; the secret of the dwarfish
figures was revealed, though behind that secret lay the darker and
more cryptic secret of their being.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

<p class="first">HOW long Conan stood drowned in dizzy cogitation,
he never knew. A voice shook him out of his gaze, a feminine voice
that shrieked more and more loudly, as if the owner of the voice
were being borne nearer. Conan recognised that voice, and his
paralysis vanished instantly.</p>

<p>A quick bound carried him high up on the narrow ledges, where he
clung, kicking aside the clustering images to obtain room for his
feet. Another spring and a scramble, and he was clinging to the rim
of the wall, glaring over it. It was an outer wall; he was looking
into the green meadow that surrounded the castle.</p>

<p>Across the grassy level a giant black was striding, carrying a
squirming captive under one arm as a man might carry a rebellious
child. It was Sancha, her black hair falling in disheveled rippling
waves, her olive skin contrasting abruptly with the glossy ebony of
her captor. He gave no heed to her wrigglings and cries as he made
for the outer archway.</p>

<p>As he vanished within, Conan sprang recklessly down the wall and
glided into the arch that opened into the further court. Crouching
there, he saw the giant enter the court of the pool, carrying his
writhing captive. Now he was able to make out the creature's
details.</p>

<p>The superb symmetry of body and limbs was more impressive at
close range. Under the ebon skin long, rounded muscles rippled, and
Conan did not doubt that the monster could rend an ordinary man
limb from limb. The nails of the fingers provided further weapons,
for they were grown like the talons of a wild beast. The face was a
carven ebony mask. The eyes were tawny, a vibrant gold that glowed
and glittered. But the face was inhuman; each line, each feature
was stamped with evil&mdash;evil transcending the mere evil of
humanity. The thing was not a human&mdash;it could not be; it was a
growth of Life from the pits of blasphemous creation&mdash;a
perversion of evolutionary development.</p>

<p>The giant cast Sancha down on the sward, where she grovelled,
crying with pain and terror. He cast a glance about as if
uncertain, and his tawny eyes narrowed as they rested on the images
overturned and knocked from the wall. Then he stooped, grasped his
captive by her neck and crotch, and strode purposefully toward the
green pool. And Conan glided from his archway, and raced like a
wind of death across the sward.</p>

<p>The giant wheeled, and his eyes flared as he saw the bronzed
avenger rushing toward him. In the instant of surprise his cruel
grip relaxed and Sancha wriggled from his hands and fell to the
grass. The taloned hands spread and clutched, but Conan ducked
beneath their swoop and drove his sword through the giant's groin.
The black went down like a felled tree, gushing blood, and the next
instant Conan was seized in a frantic grasp as Sancha sprang up and
threw her arms around him in a frenzy of terror and hysterical
relief.</p>

<p>He cursed as he disengaged himself, but his foe was already
dead; the tawny eyes were glazed, the long ebony limbs had ceased
to twitch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan," Sancha was sobbing, clinging tenaciously to him,
"what will become of us? What are these monsters? Oh, surely this
is hell and that was the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then hell needs a new devil." The Barachan grinned fiercely.
"But how did he get hold of you? Have they taken the ship?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She tried to wipe away her tears, fumbled for
her skirt, and then remembered that she wore none. "I came ashore.
I saw you follow Zaporavo, and I followed you both. I found
Zaporavo&mdash;was&mdash;was it you who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who else?" he grunted. "What then?"</p>

<p>"I saw a movement in the trees," she shuddered. "I thought it
was you. I called&mdash;then I saw that&mdash;that black thing
squatting like an ape among the branches, leering down at me. It
was like a nightmare; I couldn't run. All I could do was squeal.
Then it dropped from the tree and seized me&mdash;oh, oh, oh!" She
hid her face in her hands, and was shaken anew at the memory of the
horror.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to get out of here," he growled, catching her
wrist. "Come on; we've got to get to the crew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Most of them were asleep on the beach as I entered the woods,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Asleep?" he exclaimed profanely. "What in the seven devils of
hell's fire and damnation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" She froze, a white quivering image of fright.</p>

<p>"I heard it!" he snapped. "A moaning cry! Wait!"</p>

<p>He bounded up the ledges again and, glaring over the wall, swore
with a concentrated fury that made even Sancha gasp. The black men
were returning, but they came not alone or empty-handed. Each bore
a limp human form; some bore two. Their captives were the
Freebooters; they hung slackly in their captors' arms, and but for
an occasional vague movement or twitching, Conan would have
believed them dead. They had been disarmed but not stripped; one of
the blacks bore their sheathed swords, a great armload of bristling
steel. From time to time one of the seamen voiced a vague cry, like
a drunkard calling out in sottish sleep.</p>

<p>Like a trapped wolf Conan glared about him. Three arches led out
of the court of the pool. Through the eastern arch the blacks had
left the court, and through it they would presumably return. He had
entered by the southern arch. In the western arch he had hidden,
and had not had time to notice what lay beyond it. Regardless of
his ignorance of the plan of the castle, he was forced to make his
decision promptly.</p>

<p>Springing down the wall, he replaced the images with frantic
haste, dragged the corpse of his victim to the pool and cast it in.
It sank instantly and, as he looked, he distinctly saw an appalling
contraction&mdash;a shrinking, a hardening. He hastily turned away,
shuddering. Then he seized his companion's arm and led her hastily
toward the southern archway, while she begged to be told what was
happening.</p>

<p>"They've bagged the crew," he answered hastily. "I haven't any
plan, but we'll hide somewhere and watch. If they don't look in the
pool, they may not suspect our presence."</p>

<p>"But they'll see the blood on the grass!"</p>

<p>"Maybe they'll think one of their own devils spilled it," he
answered. "Anyway, we'll have to take the chance."</p>

<p>They were in the court from which he had watched the torture of
the boy, and he led her hastily up the stair that mounted the
southern wall, and forced her into a crouching position behind the
balustrade of the balcony; it was poor concealment, but the best
they could do.</p>

<p><br>
SCARCELY had they settled themselves, when the blacks filed into
the court. There was a resounding clash at the foot of the stairs,
and Conan stiffened, grasping his sword. But the blacks passed
through an archway on the southwestern side, and they heard a
series of thuds and groans. The giants were casting their victims
down on the sward. An hysterical giggle rose to Sancha's lips, and
Conan quickly clapped his hand over her mouth, stifling the sound
before it could betray them.</p>

<p>After a while they heard the padding of many feet on the sward
below, and then silence reigned. Conan peered over the wall. The
court was empty. The blacks were once more gathered about the pool
in the adjoining court, squatting on their haunches. They seemed to
pay no heed to the great smears of blood on the sward and the jade
rim of the pool. Evidently blood stains were nothing unusual. Nor
were they looking into the pool. They were engrossed in some
inexplicable conclave of their own; the tall black was playing
again on his golden pipes, and his companions listened like ebony
statues.</p>

<p>Taking Sancha's hand, Conan glided down the stair, stooping so
that his head would not be visible above the wall. The cringing
girl followed perforce, staring fearfully at the arch that let into
the court of the pool, but through which, at that angle, neither
the pool nor its grim throng were visible. At the foot of the stair
lay the swords of the Zingarans. The clash they had heard had been
the casting down of the captured weapons.</p>

<p>Conan drew Sancha toward the southwestern arch, and they
silently crossed the sward and entered the court beyond. There the
Freebooters lay in careless heaps, mustaches bristling, earrings
glinting. Here and there one stirred or groaned restlessly. Conan
bent down to them, and Sancha knelt beside him, leaning forward
with her hands on her thighs.</p>

<p>"What is that sweet cloying smell?" she asked nervously. "It's
on all their breaths."</p>

<p>"It's that damned fruit they were eating," he answered softly.
"I remember the smell of it. It must have been like the black
lotus, that makes men sleep. By Crom, they are beginning to
awake&mdash;but they're unarmed, and I have an idea that those
black devils won't wait long before they begin their magic on them.
What chance will the lads have, unarmed and stupid with
slumber?"</p>

<p>He brooded for an instant, scowling with the intentness of his
thoughts; then seized Sancha's olive shoulder in a grip that made
her wince.</p>

<p>"Listen! I'll draw those black swine into another part of the
castle and keep them busy for a while. Meanwhile you shake these
fools awake, and bring their swords to them&mdash;it's a fighting
chance. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know!" she stammered, shaking with
terror, and hardly knowing what she was saying.</p>

<p>With a curse, Conan caught her thick tresses near her head and
shook her until the walls danced to her dizzy sight.</p>

<p>"You must do it!" he hissed at her. "It's our only chance!"</p>

<p>"I'll do my best!" she gasped, and with a grunt of commendation
and an encouraging slap on the back that nearly knocked her down,
he glided away.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was crouching at the arch that opened
into the court of the pool, glaring upon his enemies. They still
sat about the pool, but were beginning to show evidences of an evil
impatience. From the court where lay the rousing buccaneers he
heard their groans growing louder, beginning to be mingled with
incoherent curses. He tensed his muscles and sank into a pantherish
crouch, breathing easily between his teeth.</p>

<p>The jeweled giant rose, taking his pipes from his lips&mdash;and
at that instant Conan was among the startled blacks with a tigerish
bound. And as a tiger leaps and strikes among his prey, Conan
leaped and struck: thrice his blade flickered before any could lift
a hand in defense; then he bounded from among them and raced across
the sward. Behind him sprawled three black figures, their skulls
split.</p>

<p>But though the unexpected fury of his surprize had caught the
giants off guard, the survivors recovered quickly enough. They were
at his heels as he ran through the western arch, their long legs
sweeping them over the ground at headlong speed. However, he felt
confident of his ability to outfoot them at will; but that was not
his purpose. He intended leading them on a long chase, in order to
give Sancha time to rouse and arm the Zingarans.</p>

<p>And as he raced into the court beyond the western arch, he
swore. This court differed from the others he had seen. Instead of
being round, it was octagonal, and the arch by which he had entered
was the only entrance or exit.</p>

<p>Wheeling, he saw that the entire band had followed him in; a
group clustered in the arch, and the rest spread out in a wide line
as they approached. He faced them, backing slowly toward the
northern wall. The line bent into a semicircle, spreading out to
hem him in. He continued to move backward, but more and more
slowly, noting the spaces widening between the pursuers. They
feared lest he should try to dart around a horn of the crescent,
and lengthened their line to prevent it.</p>

<p>He watched with the calm alertness of a wolf, and when he struck
it was with the devastating suddenness of a thunderbolt&mdash;full
at the center of the crescent. The giant who barred his way went
down cloven to the middle of the breast-bone, and the pirate was
outside their closing ring before the blacks to right and left
could come to their stricken comrade's aid. The group at the gate
prepared to receive his onslaught, but Conan did not charge them.
He had turned and was watching his hunters without apparent
emotion, and certainly without fear.</p>

<p>This time they did not spread out in a thin line. They had
learned that it was fatal to divide their forces against such an
incarnation of clawing, rending fury. They bunched up in a compact
mass, and advanced on him without undue haste, maintaining their
formation.</p>

<p><br>
CONAN knew that if he fell foul of that mass of taloned muscle
and bone, there could be but one culmination. Once let them drag
him down among them where they could reach him with their talons
and use their greater body-weight to advantage, even his primitive
ferocity would not prevail. He glanced around the wall and saw a
ledge-like projection above a corner on the western side. What it
was he did not know, but it would serve his purpose. He began
backing toward that corner, and the giants advanced more rapidly.
They evidently thought that they were herding him into the corner
themselves, and Conan found time to reflect that they probably
looked on him as a member of a lower order, mentally inferior to
themselves. So much the better. Nothing is more disastrous than
underestimating one's antagonist.</p>

<p>Now he was only a few yards from the wall, and the blacks were
closing in rapidly, evidently thinking to pin him in the corner
before he realised his situation. The group at the gate had
deserted their post and were hastening to join their fellows. The
giants half-crouched, eyes blazing like golden hell- fire, teeth
glistening whitely, taloned hands lifted as if to fend off attack.
They expected an abrupt and violent move on the part of their prey,
but when it came, it took them by surprise.</p>

<p>Conan lifted his sword, took a step toward them, then wheeled
and raced to the wall. With a fleeting coil and release of steel
muscles, he shot high in the air, and his straining arm hooked its
fingers over the projection. Instantly there was a rending crash
and the jutting ledge gave way, precipitating the pirate back into
the court.</p>

<p>He hit on his back, which for all its springy sinews would have
broken but for the cushioning of the sward, and rebounding like a
great cat, he faced his foes. The dancing recklessness was gone
from his eyes. They blazed like blue bale-fire; his mane bristled,
his thin lips snarled. In an instant the affair had changed from a
daring game to a battle of life and death, and Conan's savage
nature responded with all the fury of the wild.</p>

<p>The blacks, halted an instant by the swiftness of the episode,
now made to sweep on him and drag him down. But in that instant a
shout broke the stillness. Wheeling, the giants saw a disreputable
throng crowding the arch. The buccaneers weaved drunkenly, they
swore incoherently; they were addled and bewildered, but they
grasped their swords and advanced with a ferocity not dimmed in the
slightest by the fact that they did not understand what it was all
about.</p>

<p>As the blacks glared in amazement, Conan yelled stridently and
struck them like a razor-edged thunderbolt. They fell like ripe
grains beneath his blade, and the Zingarans, shouting with muddled
fury, ran groggily across the court and fell on their gigantic foes
with bloodthirsty zeal. They were still dazed; emerging hazily from
drugged slumber, they had felt Sancha frantically shaking them and
shoving swords into their fists, and had vaguely heard her urging
them to some sort of action. They had not understood all she said,
but the sight of strangers, and blood streaming, was enough for
them.</p>

<p>In an instant the court was turned into a battle-ground which
soon resembled a slaughter-house. The Zingarans weaved and rocked
on their feet, but they wielded their swords with power and effect,
swearing prodigiously, and quite oblivious to all wounds except
those instantly fatal. They far outnumbered the blacks, but these
proved themselves no mean antagonists. Towering above their
assailants, the giants wrought havoc with talons and teeth, tearing
out men's throats, and dealing blows with clenched fists that
crushed in skulls. Mixed and mingled in that melee, the buccaneers
could not use their superior agility to the best advantage, and
many were too stupid from their drugged sleep to avoid blows aimed
at them. They fought with a blind wild- beast ferocity, too intent
on dealing death to evade it. The sound of the hacking swords was
like that of butchers' cleavers, and the shrieks, yells and curses
were appalling.</p>

<p>Sancha, shrinking in the archway, was stunned by the noise and
fury; she got a dazed impression of a whirling chaos in which steel
flashed and hacked, arms tossed, snarling faces appeared and
vanished, and straining bodies collided, rebounded, locked and
mingled in a devil's dance of madness.</p>

<p>Details stood out briefly, like black etchings on a background
of blood. She saw a Zingaran sailor, blinded by a great flap of
scalp torn loose and hanging over his eyes, brace his straddling
legs and drive his sword to the hilt in a black belly. She
distinctly heard the buccaneer grunt as he struck, and saw the
victim's tawny eyes roll up in sudden agony; blood and entrails
gushed out over the driven blade. The dying black caught the blade
with his naked hands, and the sailor tugged blindly and stupidly;
then a black arm hooked about the Zingaran's head, a black knee was
planted with cruel force in the middle of his back. His head was
jerked back at a terrible angle, and something cracked above the
noise of the fray, like the breaking of a thick branch. The
conqueror dashed his victim's body to the earth&mdash;and as he
did, something like a beam of blue light flashed across his
shoulders from behind, from right to left. He staggered, his head
toppled forward on his breast, and thence, hideously, to the
earth.</p>

<p><br>
SANCHA turned sick. She gagged and wished to vomit. She made
abortive efforts to turn and flee from the spectacle, but her legs
would not work. Nor could she close her eyes. In fact, she opened
them wider. Revolted, repelled, nauseated, yet she felt the awful
fascination she had always experienced at sight of blood. Yet this
battle transcended anything she had ever seen fought out between
human beings in port raids or sea battles. Then she saw Conan.</p>

<p>Separated from his mates by the whole mass of the enemy, Conan
had been enveloped in a black wave of arms and bodies, and dragged
down. Then they would quickly have stamped the life out of him, but
he had pulled down one of them with him, and the black's body
protected that of the pirate beneath him. They kicked and tore at
the Barachan and dragged at their writhing comrade, but Conan's
teeth were set desperately in his throat, and the pirate clung
tenaciously to his dying shield.</p>

<p>An onslaught of Zingarans caused a slackening of the press, and
Conan threw aside the corpse and rose, blood-smeared and terrible.
The giants towered above him like great black shadows, clutching,
buffeting the air with terrible blows. But he was as hard to hit or
grapple as a blood-mad panther, and at every turn or flash of his
blade, blood jetted. He had already taken punishment enough to kill
three ordinary men, but his bull-like vitality was
undiminished.</p>

<p>His war cry rose above the medley of the carnage, and the
bewildered but furious Zingarans took fresh heart and redoubled
their strokes, until the rending of flesh and the crunching of bone
beneath the swords almost drowned the howls of pain and wrath.</p>

<p>The blacks wavered, and broke for the gate, and Sancha squealed
at their coming and scurried out of the way. They jammed in the
narrow archway, and the Zingarans stabbed and hacked at their
straining backs with strident yelps of glee. The gate was a
shambles before the survivors broke through and scattered, each for
himself.</p>

<p>The battle became a chase. Across grassy courts, up shimmering
stairs, over the slanting roofs of fantastic towers, even along the
broad coping of the walls, the giants fled, dripping blood at each
step, harried by their merciless pursuers as by wolves. Cornered,
some of them turned at bay and men died. But the ultimate result
was always the same&mdash;a mangled black body twitching on the
sward, or hurled writhing and twisting from parapet or tower
roof.</p>

<p>Sancha had taken refuge in the court of the pool, where she
crouched, shaking with terror. Outside rose a fierce yelling, feet
pounded the sward, and through the arch burst a black, red-stained
figure. It was the giant who wore the gemmed headband. A squat
pursuer was close behind, and the black turned, at the very brink
of the pool. In his extremity he had picked up a sword dropped by a
dying sailor, and as the Zingaran rushed recklessly at him, he
struck with the unfamiliar weapon. The buccaneer dropped with his
skull crushed, but so awkwardly the blow was dealt, the blade
shivered in the giant's hand.</p>

<p>He hurled the hilt at the figures which thronged the arch, and
bounded toward the pool, his face a convulsed mask of hate.</p>

<p>Conan burst through the men at the gate, and his feet spurned
the sward in his headlong charge.</p>

<p>But the giant threw his great arms wide and from his lips rang
an inhuman cry&mdash;the only sound made by a black during the
entire fight. It screamed to the sky its awful hate; it was like a
voice howling from the pits. At the sound the Zingarans faltered
and hesitated. But Conan did not pause. Silently and murderously he
drove at the ebon figure poised on the brink of the pool.</p>

<p>But even as his dripping sword gleamed in the air, the black
wheeled and bounded high. For a flash of an instant they saw him
poised in midair above the pool; then with an earth-shaking roar,
the green waters rose and rushed up to meet him, enveloping him in
a green volcano.</p>

<p><br>
CONAN checked his headlong rush just in time to keep from
toppling into the pool, and he sprang back, thrusting his men
behind him with mighty swings of his arms. The green pool was like
a geyser now, the noise rising to deafening volume as the great
column of water reared and reared, blossoming at the crest with a
great crown of foam.</p>

<p>Conan was driving his men to the gate, herding them ahead of
him, beating them with the flat of his sword; the roar of the
water-spout seemed to have robbed them of their faculties. Seeing
Sancha standing paralyzed, staring with wide-eyed terror at the
seething pillar, he accosted her with a bellow that cut through the
thunder of the water and made her jump out of her daze. She ran to
him, arms outstretched, and he caught her up under one arm and
raced out of the court.</p>

<p>In the court which opened on the outer world, the survivors had
gathered, weary, tattered, wounded and blood-stained, and stood
gaping dumbly at the great unstable pillar that towered momentarily
nearer the blue vault of the sky. Its green trunk was laced with
white; its foaming crown was thrice the circumference of its base.
Momentarily it threatened to burst and fall in an engulfing
torrent, yet it continued to jet skyward.</p>

<p>Conan's eyes swept the bloody, naked group, and he cursed to see
only a score. In the stress of the moment he grasped a corsair by
the neck and shook him so violently that blood from the man's
wounds spattered all near them.</p>

<p>"Where are the rest?" he bellowed in his victim's ear.</p>

<p>"That's all!" the other yelled back, above the roar of the
geyser. "The others were all killed by those black&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, get out of here!" roared Conan, giving him a thrust that
sent him staggering headlong toward the outer archway. "That
fountain is going to burst in a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll all be drowned!" squawked a Freebooter, limping toward
the arch.</p>

<p>"Drowned, hell!" yelled Conan. "We'll be turned to pieces of
petrified bone! Get out, blast you!"</p>

<p>He ran to the outer archway, one eye on the green roaring tower
that loomed so awfully above him, the other on stragglers. Dazed
with blood-lust, fighting, and the thunderous noise, some of the
Zingarans moved like men in a trance. Conan hurried them up; his
method was simple. He grasped loiterers by the scruff of the neck,
impelled them violently through the gate, added impetus with a
lusty kick in the rear, spicing his urgings for haste with pungent
comments on the victim's ancestry. Sancha showed an inclination to
remain with him, but he jerked away her twining arms, blaspheming
luridly, and accelerated her movements with a tremendous slap on
the posterior that sent her scurrying across the plateau.</p>

<p>Conan did not leave the gate until he was sure all his men who
yet lived were out of the castle and started across the level
meadow. Then he glanced again at the roaring pillar looming against
the sky, dwarfing the towers, and he too fled that castle of
nameless horrors.</p>

<p>The Zingarans had already crossed the rim of the plateau and
were fleeing down the slopes. Sancha waited for him at the crest of
the first slope beyond the rim, and there he paused for an instant
to look back at the castle. It was as if a gigantic green-stemmed
and white-blossomed flower swayed above the towers; the roar filled
the sky. Then the jade-green and snowy pillar broke with a noise
like the rending of the skies, and walls and towers were blotted
out in a thunderous torrent.</p>

<p>Conan caught the girl's hand, and fled. Slope after slope rose
and fell before them, and behind sounded the rushing of a river. A
glance over his straining shoulder showed a broad green ribbon
rising and falling as it swept over the slopes. The torrent had not
spread out and dissipated; like a giant serpent it flowed over the
depressions and the rounded crests. It held a consistent
course&mdash;it was following them.</p>

<p>The realisation roused Conan to a greater pitch of endurance.
Sancha stumbled and went to her knees with a moaning cry of despair
and exhaustion. Catching her up, Conan tossed her over his giant
shoulder and ran on. His breast heaved, his knees trembled; his
breath tore in great gasps through his teeth. He reeled in his
gait. Ahead of him he saw the sailors toiling, spurred on by the
terror that gripped them.</p>

<p>The ocean burst suddenly on his view, and in his swimming gaze
floated the Wastrel, unharmed. Men tumbled into the boats
helter-skelter. Sancha fell into the bottom and lay there in a
crumpled heap. Conan, though the blood thundered in his ears and
the world swam red to his gaze, took an oar with the panting
sailors.</p>

<p><br>
WITH hearts ready to burst from exhaustion, they pulled for the
ship. The green river burst through the fringe of trees. Those
trees fell as if their stems had been cut away, and as they sank
into the jade-colored flood, they vanished. The tide flowed out
over the beach, lapped at the ocean, and the waves turned a deeper,
more sinister green.</p>

<p>Unreasoning, instinctive fear held the buccaneers, making them
urge their agonised bodies and reeling brains to greater effort;
what they feared they knew not, but they did know that in that
abominable smooth green ribbon was a menace to body and to soul.
Conan knew, and as he saw the broad line slip into the waves and
stream through the water toward them, without altering its shape or
course, he called up his last ounce of reserve strength so fiercely
that the oar snapped in his hands.</p>

<p>But their prows bumped against the timbers of the Wastrel, and
the sailors staggered up the chains, leaving the boats to drift as
they would. Sancha went up on Conan's broad shoulder, hanging limp
as a corpse, to be dumped unceremoniously on to the deck as the
Barachan took the wheel, gasping orders to his skeleton of a crew.
Throughout the affair, he had taken the lead without question, and
they had instinctively followed him. They reeled about like drunken
men, fumbling mechanically at ropes and braces. The anchor chain,
unshackled, splashed into the water, the sails unfurled and bellied
in a rising wind. The Wastrel quivered and shook herself, and swung
majestically seaward. Conan glared shoreward; like a tongue of
emerald flame, a ribbon licked out on the water futilely, an oar's
length from the Wastrel's keel. It advanced no further. From that
end of the tongue, his gaze followed an unbroken stream of lambent
green, across the white beach, and over the slopes, until it faded
in the blue distance.</p>

<p>The Barachan, regaining his wind, grinned at the panting crew.
Sancha was standing near him, hysterical tears coursing down her
cheeks. Conan's breeks hung in blood-stained tatters; his girdle
and sheath were gone, his sword, driven upright into the deck
beside him, was notched and crusted with red. Blood thickly clotted
his black mane, and one ear had been half torn from his head. His
arms, legs, breast and shoulders were bitten and clawed as if by
panthers. But he grinned as he braced his powerful legs, and swung
on the wheel in sheer exuberance of muscular might.</p>

<p>"What now?" faltered the girl.</p>

<p>"The plunder of the seas!" he laughed. "A paltry crew, and that
chewed and clawed to pieces, but they can work the ship, and crews
can always be found. Come here, girl, and give me a kiss."</p>

<p>"A kiss?" she cried hysterically. "You think of kisses at a time
like this?"</p>

<p>His laughter boomed above the snap and thunder of the sails, as
he caught her up off her feet in the crook of one mighty arm, and
smacked her red lips with resounding relish.</p>

<p>"I think of Life!" he roared. "The dead are dead, and what has
passed is done! I have a ship and a fighting crew and a girl with
lips like wine, and that's all I ever asked. Lick your wounds,
bullies, and break out a cask of ale. You're going to work ship as
she never was worked before. Dance and sing while you buckle to it,
damn you! To the devil with empty seas! We're bound for waters
where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with
plunder!"</p>
