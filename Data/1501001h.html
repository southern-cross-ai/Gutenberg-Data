  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; THE RESCUE</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL NAYLOR wanted to make up his mind between two jobs,
  both of which were open to him. There were always jobs open to Naylor because
  he had unusual talents. He could use a running iron with wonderful effect.
  There was hardly a rustler on the entire range more skillful in twisting a
  bit of heavy wire into shapes required for the altering of staple brands into
  new ones. He had dealt crooked faro in many places, and he was more than a
  fair hand at stacking a pack in a poker game. However, there are ups and
  downs in the gambling profession. The last little brawl had laid him up in
  hospital for two months. He was still weak in the body, and a little shaky in
  the nerves. And as for working as a rustler, he felt that a man who has been
  once cornered by a posse of indignant cattle owners and then turned loose has
  had warning enough.</p>

  <p>So Bill Naylor had come into the country to his home town of Kendal to
  rest for a few weeks and make up his mind about the next step. Being of a
  surly and a lonely temper, he went out to watch the moonrise on the Kendal
  River, not because he appreciated the beauty of the scene, but because it was
  a good place to find solitude. There he sat on a rock beside the roar of
  Kendal Falls, smoked and meditated.</p>

  <p>If he started to smuggle opium, the wages were high, and there was a fat
  commission on deliveries. Also, he knew all about how to roast a "pill," and
  he felt that nothing is much better than a smoke of opium at night if there
  can be a stiff shot of whisky as an eye-opener in the morning. On the other
  hand, there was a good deal to be said for work as a moonshiner.</p>

  <p>The profits were by no means as high, but the law punished the crime with
  a prison term proportionately shorter. To one who, like Bill Naylor, had
  spent half his life in prison already, the last item was a tidy score in the
  accounting. Besides, he liked the life of a moonshiner, the free days, the
  brisk companionship. And it is astonishing how much life will flow into the
  vicinity of a little still back in the mountains.</p>

  <p>It was hard&mdash;it was very hard for him to make the choice. Some of the
  days south of the river were very memorable and delightful. Life in Mexico,
  flavored with tequila, was not to be sneered at. And the black, tarry liquid
  itself, with the little taint of red in it, like a stain of mortal red, had a
  special beauty in his mind. He felt also, that it was a more dignified
  calling, that of a smuggler. It was worthy of a man's efforts. If he went up
  for smuggling opium, it was a thing to get space in the newspapers. It was a
  thing that would make his old associates, wherever they were, exclaim to one
  another: "Nerve, that's what Bill Naylor has! They can't keep that man
  down!"</p>

  <p>Thrusting out his square jaw, and scowling till a shadow from his brows
  covered half of his face, Bill Naylor considered the situation and decided
  that that was a good simile. He was like a furtive, hunted beast that has
  been driven into the water, and every time he came up for air the law took a
  kick at his head.</p>

  <p>He looked up, still scowling. Opium was beginning to win out, in his mind.
  And now he saw four riders come out slowly along the flat arch of the wooden
  bridge that spanned the river not far above the falls. They looked black and
  huge, for the moon was behind them. The moon threw on the polished face of
  the river the skeleton shadow of the bridge and even dimly marked out the
  images of the four riders.</p>

  <p>Those four fellows all had their jobs, of course. They were riding in from
  some distant ranch to celebrate the end of the month by spending all their
  wages on bad bar whisky. The ordinary run of block-head was what they were,
  no doubt.</p>

  <p>He made another cigarette, and was about to light it when there was a
  sudden commotion, a jumbling together of the silhouettes that had been
  advancing across the bridge, and thereafter the figure of a man flipped over
  the side of the bridge, dropped down, and smote the water. It leaped in a dim
  flash at the place where the body disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor stood up and stared.</p>

  <p>"That ain't so bad," he said aloud.</p>

  <p>He had a feeling that in this world one only needs to keep the eyes open
  in order to see a great many unexpected things.</p>

  <p>The men on the bridge remained for a moment, then they proceeded at a
  casual gait. Of course, it would be folly for them to try to effect a rescue.
  That fellow had either been killed in striking the water, or else he would be
  whirled over the roar and ruin of the big falls. He might, to be sure, strike
  on one of the rocks that projected like so many shark's teeth at the verge of
  the falls, but it was hardly better to be impaled at the brink of the falls
  than to be carried down with the waters.</p>

  <p>Now, peering carefully, Naylor saw a shadow come swirling with the
  currents. It verged toward the brink of the falls. He could distinctly see
  the gleam of the face and the sweeping shadow of hair worn almost long enough
  to be the hair of a woman.</p>

  <p>One of these backwoods fellows wearing his hair after a frontier fashion
  that was out of date. Well, he would soon not care whether his hair was long
  or short!</p>

  <p>The body seemed to dally, as though a rope were pulling it back from
  death. Then the final surge of the current caught hold of it like a spear and
  hurled it at the brink of the falls.</p>

  <p>"Gone for sure!" said Bill Naylor, grinning a little.</p>

  <p>But then he distinctly saw the body strike on one of the rocks. It doubled
  over on the keen tooth. Head and legs streamed out with the downward current.
  Well, the river would soon work that obstacle clear and carry it down to be
  pounded to a pulp among the rocks of the lower canyon.</p>

  <p>It was a miracle to Bill Naylor, when, as he lighted and smoked another
  cigarette, he saw the wounded man stir, raise a hand to the top of the rock,
  and strive to pull himself up the face of it. He had not sufficient
  strength.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor, without the least excitement, considered the possibilities of
  effecting a rescue. He cared not a whit whether the man went over the falls
  or not, but it was also true that a man saved from the brink of death
  generally feels gratitude, and often this gratitude can be expressed in terms
  of hard cash. Bill Naylor looked on the stranger as he might have looked on a
  big fish in a stream. He decided instantly that to attempt to clamber out
  over the rocks to the point where the man was clinging would be far too
  hazardous. So he sat down on his heels and went on smoking.</p>

  <p>A good-sized log came spinning down the current, twisting aslant just
  above the cataract. Now it struck the rocks with a crash that splintered it
  in several places. The shock of it tossed up a shower of spray on Bill
  Naylor.</p>

  <p>"I sit here and worry about savin' lives like a fool," he said. "I hope he
  goes&mdash;fast!"</p>

  <p>He stood up in disgust. The cold of the water bit at his body, which was
  warm and tender under the shelter of his clothes.</p>

  <p>Then he was amazed to see that this man, who already should have been
  dead, was now at the end of the log, and handing himself along the length of
  it as far as it went.</p>

  <p>This brought him fairly close.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor walked out over the safe rocks near the shore and leaned over.
  There was a gap of perhaps five feet between the end of the log to which the
  man clung and the side of the rock where Naylor squatted. That was not much
  of a span, but the fellow could never make it. Through the narrow chasm the
  water plunged in a solid crystal, streaked deep down with films of foaming
  speed. If the stranger tried to cross that chasm, he would be squirted into
  eternity like a watermelon seed pressed between thumb and forefinger.</p>

  <p>The comparison pleased Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>Well, the man would never bridge that narrow gap unaided. Should he make
  the effort?&mdash;Naylor asked himself. There was more than a little peril
  involved. If he secured a good grip on a projecting pinnacle on his side and
  extended his hand, it was possible that the rushing force of the water would
  break his hold.</p>

  <p>He put his hand down into the stream. The force of it made his arm
  tremble, and he stood up again and shook his head.</p>

  <p>There was no chance to speak above the thundering of the water. And the
  stranger, floating there on the verge of death, made no effort to appeal,
  even with gestures. Naylor, studying the face, saw that it was very handsome,
  with a capacious, high forehead, a bony, powerful chin, and plenty of
  refinement in the modeling of all the features.</p>

  <p>That was most undoubtedly a fellow of force. He looked like some famous
  man whose picture had been before the attentive eye of Bill Naylor. But Bill
  disliked the height of the forehead. His own brow was low and cramped and
  indented. He felt like snarling when he saw features so godlike.</p>

  <p>The man was young, too. He was young, handsome, probably brainy, with the
  most brilliant future ahead of him. Perhaps he was even a rich man.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Naylor to himself, "you can go down for all of me."</p>

  <p>He saw the head of the stranger bow a little. He had been trying to pull
  himself out of the water and get on top of the log: the effort was too great
  for him. He was smashed up. Perhaps the rock had torn him like the bite of a
  sea monster. And now his head dropped a little&mdash;not in despair, but in
  sheer weakness.</p>

  <p>"A dead game one," said Naylor to himself. "Sure a dead game one."</p>

  <p>He admired gameness. It was practically the only virtue that he himself
  possessed, but he felt that he never could have found himself in the
  situation of the stranger without making some frantic efforts to persuade the
  other fellow to a rescue. The stranger had not lifted a hand.</p>

  <p>Somehow Bill Naylor found himself lowering his body over the side of the
  rock. He had a good grip with his left hand on a projecting fragment of the
  stone&mdash;suppose that fragment should break off?&mdash;and now he extended
  his right hand to the other.</p>

  <p>A cold, hard grip locked instantly on his wrist, and a shock of terror
  spurted through the heart and the veins of Naylor. For he realized that he
  would never be able to break that grip; it was the bulldog clutch of a strong
  and desperate man, clinging to his last hope of life.</p>

  <p>Now for the great effort! He set his teeth and pulled with all his might.
  The hand of the stranger burned his flesh, ground it against the bones of his
  wrist.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor felt his clutch on the rock slipping. If the cursed water only
  pulled with a steady force it would be all right&mdash;he could win. But
  there were tremors and jerks; the devil was tugging him toward the mouth of
  hell.</p>

  <p>Then in an instant the strain ceased. He found the stranger floating
  beside him near the rock.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; A KING OF CRIME</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Naylor was a little boy, his father had said to him:
  "No man needs to do anything except what he wants to do."</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor had said: "Suppose he's done in and wants to faint. What can
  he do to stop that?"</p>

  <p>"No man needs to do anything except what he wants to do," repeated the
  elder Naylor, who was a strong-willed man.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor remembered that speech as he worked the injured stranger
  toward the shore. The fellow ought to have been dead a thousand times over.
  He ought to be dying now, to judge by the way the blood kept pouring out of
  his torn body. But he would not even faint. He simply kept his teeth locked.
  There was no grinning distortion of Spartan effort about that, either. The
  will that the stranger was using was not in his muscles, but in his brain. So
  there was not even a wrinkling of his brow as he staggered at the side of
  Naylor. He kept his face forward. He wasted no breath in speech, and
  presently Naylor had him stretched on the ground on the pine needles. The
  black of the shadow was streaked with moonlight to show his calm face.</p>

  <p>"I'll fetch you a doctor," said Naylor, "and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stay here. Do what I say," said the other. "Take this first." He took a
  wallet out of his pocket and held it forth. "That's only a beginning," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Naylor opened the wallet and saw a sheaf of bills well compacted. They
  were sodden with water, but he could read the denomination of the topmost,
  and it was a hundred dollars.</p>

  <p>Even if the other bills were much smaller, there was between two and three
  thousand dollars in that wallet. Naylor closed the wallet, shoved the wetness
  of it into his pocket, and said nothing. He knew that he had come to a great
  moment. He knew that it was his good luck that had forced him to attempt that
  rescue.</p>

  <p>He heard the other saying: "You can't bring me a doctor. I'm Barry
  Christian."</p>

  <p>The knees of Naylor sagged a little. A great moment? Yes, it was the
  greatest of his life. Through his brain a thousand memories whirled, each a
  distinct face, shooting through his mind like the silhouettes of people in a
  crowded passenger coach when it goes by at full speed. Barry Christian! How
  many times had that great foeman of the law won mighty prizes? Who in this
  world had ever gained even the slightest victory over him with the exception
  of that superman known as "Jim Silver"? And now all of Barry Christian lay
  there on the pine needles at the feet of Naylor.</p>

  <p>Even so, he did not feel the stronger of the two. The brainy fellows who
  obeyed the law could be damned, for all of him; but this was a great master,
  a king of the world of crime, and a sort of awe spread over the disturbed
  spirit of Bill.</p>

  <p>"You tell me; I'm your man," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's only the first," said Barry Christian. "They've got a reward on
  me, and it's a big one. But I think you'll make more out of me by giving me a
  hand. Make up your mind."</p>

  <p>In a sudden heat of enthusiasm, Bill Naylor exclaimed: "I wouldn't turn
  you in if the reward was a million. I don't kiss the foot of anybody to get
  blood money. My name's Bill Naylor. Maybe you've heard of me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have. You've worked in Mexico," said the calm, small voice of
  Christian.</p>

  <p>It was the sweetest tribute that Naylor had ever heard. It was more to him
  than a Congressional Medal.</p>

  <p>"Go and spill the beans. Tell me what you want. If you've ever heard
  anything about me, you know I don't split on a pal."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Christian. "Take off your coat and wrap it around me. Twist
  it hard around me to stop the bleeding as much as you can. Get into town. Buy
  some needles and some surgical silk. Get a bottle of alcohol for a
  disinfectant. Get some brandy, too, and something to eat, and bring
  everything back to me here. Bring a lantern, too."</p>

  <p>"That'll take me more'n half an hour," said Naylor, measuring the distance
  to the town.</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime I may be dead. But that's all right," said Christian.
  "The world is made of chance. Hurry along."</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor hurried. He ran himself out of breath, made the purchases,
  visited his father's house on the verge of the town long enough to borrow a
  horse, and after saddling it, galloped rapidly back.</p>

  <p>When he swung out of the saddle he expected to find the body gone. It was
  in place.</p>

  <p>He expected to find it cold with death. But at once the steady, weak voice
  said to him:</p>

  <p>"Quick work, Naylor. Light that lantern and we'll get to work."</p>

  <p>Naylor lighted the lantern. Then he laid bare the side of Christian. There
  was a great, ragged rent that half sickened him to look at.</p>

  <p>"Put my shoulders against the tree," Christian said. "Then dip the needles
  and the silk in the alcohol."</p>

  <p>Naylor gripped Christian under the armpits and heaved on the heavy body
  until the back of the great outlaw was supported against the tree.</p>

  <p>Then he dipped the needles and the silk thread in the bottle of alcohol
  while Christian held one hand over the lips of his wound. The dark blood kept
  oozing out rapidly through his fingers. But the man would not even weaken. He
  would not even sigh. Only now and then came a breath a little longer and
  deeper than the others, and his nostrils flared out a little. But the man was
  all steel, cold and perfectly tempered.</p>

  <p>Presently he asked for the needles, and threaded the first one.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I'll be able to do a good job," said Naylor, his lips
  twitching in horror as he saw the rent in the flesh.</p>

  <p>"You? I wouldn't ask you to do such dirty work for me," said Christian.
  "I'll do it myself. I've seen the doctors work."</p>

  <p>And he began to work the needle right down into his flesh, turning it
  inside so that the mouth of the wound yawned open for a moment and the rush
  of the blood increased. He tied each stitch, driving the needle remorselessly
  through his own flesh. What was worst to watch was the drawing of the thread
  through the hole that the needle had made. All that Naylor could do was to
  cut the thread after the knot had been tied, drawing one section of the wound
  together.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that the work would never end. A fine sweat came out on
  the face of Christian and gathered in beads. He asked for brandy and took a
  long pull at the bottle. The sweat began to run on his face. Naylor took a
  handkerchief and wiped the sweat away.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, partner," said the great Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>The soul of Naylor worked in him.</p>

  <p>"Don't thank me," he muttered. "I'm not doing a thing."</p>

  <p>Every moment counted, when the blood was running out of him like that, but
  Christian spared the time to look up from his work with a smile. And as he
  endured the agony and smiled at Naylor, it seemed to Bill that he had never
  seen a face so noble, so calm, or so great.</p>

  <p>Never had such an emotion disturbed the dark soul of Naylor.</p>

  <p>The sewing of the wound ended with Christian asking questions about where
  they could put up. Naylor offered his father's house, but Christian pointed
  out that even in the best family in the world there was not apt to be enough
  honesty to conceal the presence of a man wanted by the law as he was.</p>

  <p>"If you can trust one man in a million, you're in luck," said Christian.
  "I've found you, Naylor, and that's luck enough for me. I don't want to take
  chances."</p>

  <p>There were always deserted shacks in the mountains, and Naylor knew of one
  of these. So Christian directed him to cut down or break down two small
  saplings and make with them a litter which the horse could drag. In that way
  Christian could be transported to his new home.</p>

  <p>Naylor worked hard and fast. He had dressed Christian's wound with a
  bandage and wrapped him in two thick blankets brought from his house. Now he
  was soon able to drag the weight of the wounded man onto the litter&mdash;for
  Christian was now too weak to stir his own weight. He could only endure the
  pain in silence.</p>

  <p>On the litter, Naylor lashed him with a lariat; then he raised the litter
  and tied it into the stirrups of the saddle. After that he led the horse
  carefully forward, stopping now and then to go back and look at his man. And
  on each occasion Christian smiled silently at him.</p>

  <p>They reached the shack. And there, on a bed of evergreen boughs and
  saplings, Naylor stretched out the wounded man.</p>

  <p>There was one long sigh from Christian. He said: "Leave me like this.
  Don't offer me anything. Let me lie here till the morning. I'm going to
  sleep."</p>

  <p>Sleep, with those stitches gripping at the rawness of his flesh?</p>

  <p>Well, it was true that he was able to do it. When Naylor twice looked in
  on Christian, he found him each time calmly slumbering. Once he could see by
  the moonlight. Once he could tell by the count of the evenly measured
  breathing.</p>

  <p>So Naylor, in the gray of the dawn, made another hurried trip to the town
  of Kendal to make more purchases. He bought plenty of provisions. To the
  storekeeper, who was curious, he simply said:</p>

  <p>"I'm going up and do a little prospecting for myself. There's gold in
  those mountains."</p>

  <p>The storekeeper grinned. But, though he was curious, he was also discreet.
  He asked no more questions, but went on:</p>

  <p>"There's news just come up over the telephone from Crow's Nest. The real
  Jim Silver's back in town, and he brought the crooked Jim Silver along with
  him. Seems the fact is that the dumb-bells down there had the real Jim Silver
  in jail, all right, and the crook who robbed the bank was just a fellow by
  name of Duff Gregor that happened to look a good bit like Silver."</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" said Naylor. "Is that right? I thought that Silver had gone
  crooked at last. Is that wrong?"</p>

  <p>For that was the story&mdash;that Jim Silver, the archfoe of Christian,
  had at last abandoned the ways of the law-abiding to plunder the rich bank of
  Henry Wilbur, in Crow's Nest. It had been a great comfort to Naylor, who
  always felt that honesty is merely a matter of policy with most, and that
  every man has his price.</p>

  <p>"He even had Silver's horse, Parade," said Naylor in a complaining voice.
  "It must 'a' been Silver that robbed the bank and got away with the
  loot."</p>

  <p>The other shook his head. "It was Duff Gregor, riding a hoss that looked
  considerable like Silver's chestnut. But the real Jim Silver, after Taxi got
  him out of the jail, climbed on the trail, grabbed Duff Gregor, grabbed Barry
  Christian, who was behind all Gregor's tricks, and got hold of the loot, too.
  But the biggest news of all is that Barry Christian, rather than go back to
  the death house, chucked himself off the bridge up the river and went over
  the falls!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; A JOB FOR NAYLOR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE cabin stood in a secluded corner between two hills, with
  a thick stand of trees all around it. There was only one drawback, and that
  was that Bill Naylor had to travel a distance to get water. On the other
  hand, the absence of water was what secured them from intrusion. For no man
  looking for a deserted camp was apt to go to a place where water had to be
  dug for.</p>

  <p>So for five days Naylor patiently nursed Barry Christian through a quick,
  violent fever, and then saw him start to progress toward good health. Every
  day that brought him closer to normalcy was a day that brought Bill Naylor
  closer to a golden reward. He could not say how much there would be in it,
  but legend said that Barry Christian despised money&mdash;used it like water,
  in fact! And how he would pour it forth on a man who had saved his life and
  then nursed him back to health! It was a subject of day-dreams which soothed
  the hours for Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>He had plenty to do, what with changing the bandages, and cooking, and
  washing, and shaving the sick man, and then making trips to town every day in
  order to pick up news. And of news that was interesting to Christian, there
  was a great store.</p>

  <p>Above all, he wanted to know the fate of Duff Gregor and of the next moves
  of Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>About Gregor, the fact was that the evidence against him was certain to
  send him to prison. But the trial would not come for a number of days.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Naylor, "money will get a slick lawyer, and a slick lawyer
  will help Gregor, if you wanta help him."</p>

  <p>Christian looked at him with eyes of mild wonder.</p>

  <p>"Why, Bill," he said, "Duff Gregor worked with me. I can't let him
  down."</p>

  <p>"Aw, sure. I know," said Naylor. "A gent sticks by his partners, all
  right. But what can you do? You can't crack the world open like a nut, can
  you? You can't crack it open and give the insides of it even to your best
  friends."</p>

  <p>"Is that the way you feel about it?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>"Why," said Naylor, "I'd stick by a partner. But when a gent is working
  outside the law, he's gotta take what's coming to him, don't he?"</p>

  <p>"True," said Christian. "But if Duff Gregor goes to jail, part of my
  reputation goes to jail with him. There was a time, not so long ago, when I
  could say that some of my friends had been bumped off. Nobody can help a
  bullet from hitting its mark now and then. But I could also say that none of
  my crew was rotting in prison. It's different, now. It's a lot different,
  since Jim Silver got on the trail!"</p>

  <p>He was silent, and the gloom which Naylor rarely saw in his face now
  clouded it darkly.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Naylor. "Silver's a devil. Everybody says that. And he's
  hounded you for a long time. But you've about used up your bad luck, and the
  next trick may be yours."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Christian. "There'll be no doubt of that. The next time I get
  a chance, a bullet goes through the brain of him. I won't wait to do a fancy
  job. Once, Naylor," he added bitterly, "I had him tied in a chair with a fuse
  burning and enough dynamite under him to blow up a hundred men. I walked out
  of a locked house and left him to go smash. And that was the time that Taxi
  walked in through the locks and turned him loose again. And just the other
  day, because of the way I played the game, I had Silver locked in a jail for
  another man's crooked work, and a whole town of armed men hungry to lynch
  him. And Taxi walked into that jail and took Silver out. But, of course, you
  know well the story of that.</p>

  <p>"I've been like a king, Naylor. I've had men around me, every one of whom
  was fit to lead a gang. But where are they now? Prison, most of 'em. Some of
  them haven't been caught, but they're scattered. And those that have wangled
  their way out of prison are scattered, too. The last thing they want is to
  work with me again.</p>

  <p>"Again if Duff Gregor goes to the pen, then the rest of the crowd will be
  surer than ever that I'm bad luck for the fellows who are my partners. But if
  I can get Duff Gregor out of prison now that the eyes of the whole world are
  on him&mdash;if I can get him out safe and sound and put him on his feet as a
  free man again, every one of the old partners will begin to think of the
  golden days before the pack was broken up. They'll want to run with the old
  leader. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said the other. "You have a long head, Barry." He added: "But you
  could make plenty of money all by yourself. Why do you want to team up with
  anybody? You could be rich and safe, all by yourself. It's having partners
  that gets a fellow into trouble. There's Gregor, now. You got him on your
  mind. But if you were playing a lone hand, you wouldn't worry about anything
  except about your own cards."</p>

  <p>Christian nodded. "But what's the pleasure, Bill?" he asked. "To drift
  about by oneself and do a fat job now and then and rake in a load of money?
  Is that exciting? No, it's only a cheap game."</p>

  <p>Naylor blinked as he listened. A great deal of this was far above his
  head.</p>

  <p>Christian explained: "But when I had my organization built up, I could
  speak a word in Butte City and start a man moving in old Mexico. I had big
  lawyers on my pay roll. I had safe crackers, second-story workers, and every
  kind of a handy man you could ask for. They were scattered, but they were
  always with an ear to the ground, waiting for orders. And around me I had a
  dozen men always, the pick of the land, every one of them hard as steel and
  true as steel. Men like you, Bill."</p>

  <p>A shudder of joy ran-through the body of Bill Naylor He swallowed and said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I want to build the great machine again," said Christian. "And I'm going
  to wangle it. But the first step is about Duff Gregor. I've got to get him
  free. My reputation isn't worth an egg till Gregor's free again."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Naylor vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Silver!" exclaimed Christian. "What's the latest news about him? Now that
  the whole town of Crow's Nest is making a god of him, I suppose he'll settle
  down there and marry the banker's millions and get fat."</p>

  <p>Naylor squinted his eyes and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Men say," he remarked, "that Silver and the girl have been a whole lot
  together. But now he's disappeared again. All at once he was gone, and didn't
  leave a thing except a letter behind him. And no forwarding address."</p>

  <p>Christian closed his eyes and nodded.</p>

  <p>"That clears the field for me a little," he said. "But as long as Silver
  stays on the trail, I know that his eyes are going to be sharp and his hand
  quick. And the moment he settles down&mdash;yes, for as much as six
  months&mdash;I'll come down on him and find him only half the man that he
  used to be! But I'm glad to have him out of the way in Crow's Nest."</p>

  <p>"Look at him, what kind of a crazy gazoo he is," said Bill Naylor, still
  shaking his head. "There he goes and has more'n anybody could ask for in his
  hands. And he don't take it! He won't even take the cash reward that they
  wanted to give him. He won't even let his partner, Taxi, know where he's
  gone. He just fades out of the picture, and that's all there is to it. His
  hands are as empty right now as they were before there was all the trouble.
  What does he get?"</p>

  <p>"He gets reputation," said the other man gloomily. "There's not a boy in
  the whole West that doesn't dream at night and think that he's Jim Silver,
  riding Parade. There's not a lad on the whole range that doesn't tell himself
  he'd be willing to die if he could be Jim Silver for ten days. Think of
  Crow's Nest, now. The fathers are telling their sons that Jim Silver is the
  right sort of a man. The women are telling Jim Silver stories to their babes.
  And Barry Christian is lying here in a ragged little shack in the woods,
  realizing that he's got to start almost at the beginning."</p>

  <p>His voice changed suddenly as he looked toward Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I'm not as far back as at the beginning. I have you,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Naylor with emotion. "You have me, partner."</p>

  <p>Christian held out his hand and gripped that of the other man.</p>

  <p>"I don't thank you," he said. "The time hasn't come for that. Besides,
  words don't mean a thing. But I have you, Bill, and the knowledge of that
  makes me feel strong. I have you, and I have one other thing."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Something I'm going to ask you to get for me. It's only two days' ride
  away."</p>

  <p>"Can you fend for yourself?" asked Naylor.</p>

  <p>"I can," said Christian. "I can sit up, and I can move about, slowly. You
  can cook up some grub before you start, and I'll take care of myself."</p>

  <p>"All right," said the other. "Put a name to it, and I'll try my hand."</p>

  <p>"I want you to ride south," said Christian, "till you come to the Blue
  Water Mountains. I want you to ride up the Blue Water River till you get to
  the town of Blue Water. I want you to go into a certain old house there, and
  down in the cellar of it you'll find a certain room, and in the room there's
  a brick floor, and under some of those bricks there's a hole, and in that
  hole there's a parcel wrapped in canvas and oiled silk. Will you get it for
  me and bring it here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get it," exclaimed Bill Naylor with a savage earnestness. "I'll get
  it, Barry, if I have to wade though fire for it! And if it held a diamond
  that weighed ten pounds, I wouldn't as much as look inside the wrappings.
  I'll bring it back to you exactly the way it is when I find it!"</p>

  <p>He was half blinded by his enthusiasm, and therefore he did not see or
  attach any significance to the slight smile that stirred the lips of Barry
  Christian before this speech had ended.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE OLD MILL</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS sunset two days later when Bill Naylor had his first
  look at the town of Blue Water. He did not like it. He came in from the east,
  and the town was black cardboard against the smoke and fire of the west. It
  looked a dismal town, the sort of a town a man could expect to die in.</p>

  <p>"This is a tough job," Bill Naylor said to himself.</p>

  <p>He had been saying that all during the two days of his riding. It was a
  tough job, and it was over his head. He had told the great man his opinion in
  direct and stinging language.</p>

  <p>"What d'you think I am?" he had said to Barry Christian. "You think I'm a
  whole fire company and a brigade of U.S. cavalry? I ain't. I'm only human. I
  can't get away with a big thing like this!"</p>

  <p>Barry Christian had simply laid a hand on Bill Naylor's doubled fist and
  looked straight into his eyes, saying in that deep, rich, hypnotic voice:</p>

  <p>"I know what you feel about yourself, Bill. And I know what I feel about
  you. There's difference. You add yourself up and find a minus. I add you up
  and find that you're an important man. There's only one great thing that you
  haven't learned. No man in the world can take a big job and do it in a
  minute; the thing to do is to go on step by step and don't cross the bridges
  until your feet are wet with the water."</p>

  <p>That was what had proved the antidote for the miseries of Bill Naylor's
  mind during the journey. Now that he was in sight of the goal and repeated
  the same words to himself, a great part of the comfort had departed from
  them. He watched the smoke going up from the town into the haze of the sunset
  as he sat the saddle with his horse panting beneath him, and the cinches
  creaking.</p>

  <p>"I'm just an ordinary mug," he had told Barry Christian. "I can do an
  ordinary job, but I'm nothing to write home about. I'm no headliner. Get
  that, because I mean it. I can ride a horse and shoot a gun. I've got a pair
  of hands, too. But I'm nothing fancy."</p>

  <p>Barry Christian had said: "I'd rather have a steady man who'll take a step
  at a time than any of the fancy boys who are sure of themselves. I'd rather
  have a fellow who doubts himself before he starts working than a fellow who
  does his doubting after things begin to go wrong. Bill, you'll get farther
  forward than you expect to."</p>

  <p>It was the exquisite comfort of this flattery that had spurred Bill Naylor
  all the way to Blue Water. Here he was in the town, and he was surprised that
  he had come this far. He was quite sure that he would not attempt the job
  that had been outlined for him, but nevertheless he went on to look at the
  site.</p>

  <p>He went straight through the town and came out well up the river until he
  found the old mill which had been repaired as a sort of cheap hotel. Only, as
  Christian had said, the word had gone out that it was not a hotel at all, but
  a hang-out for crooks of some gang. Nobody knew what they were driving at. It
  might even be that already they had discovered the mysterious parcel under
  the floor of the room in the cellar.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor, as he tethered his mustang in a grove nearby, began to shake
  his head. He was still shaking it as he came out and sat down at the verge of
  the brush, looking at the irregular outline of the gloomy building and at the
  way the last of the fire of the sunset was swirling down Blue Water Creek.
  Lights came on here and there in the small windows of the old mill. For some
  reason or other, though they were not millers, the occupants of the place
  still used the old machinery, and now the wheel was clanking with a
  monotonous and groaning and wooden sound. There is no noise more horrible
  than the grinding of wood against wood. It put the teeth of Bill Naylor on
  edge, no matter how little sensitive he might be.</p>

  <p>"What does Barry Christian want? The world with a fence around it? He
  can't get it out of me!" said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>And then he grew suddenly afraid of what the imp of the perverse in his
  own soul might force him to do.</p>

  <p>"Step after step" is what does the trick, Christian had said, and, step
  after step, Naylor found himself drawing closer to the mill. When he was near
  it, through the brush, he sat down on his heels again, for he saw a man
  strolling aimlessly up and down at the side of the mill, as though he were
  out to enjoy the air and the last of the sunset. But men who are enjoying the
  sunset do not, as rule, carry the weight of a double-barreled shotgun tucked
  under the arm.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor slowly pushed around the mill to the farther side, and again
  peered out from the edge of the brush, and again he saw a nonchalant figure
  of a man strolling up and down, up and down, with a double-barreled shotgun
  under the arm.</p>

  <p>Naylor went far back into the brush and found the mustang.</p>

  <p>"I'm goin' to get myself right out of this," he told himself aloud. But
  with his hand on the lead-rope knot he paused again. He found that his
  fingers were only fumbling blindly at the knot while his mind was struggling
  with the greater problem of the mill and the mystery that it contained. If
  there were a sheriff in Blue Water, he ought to be interested, also.</p>

  <p>Suppose a man were to take off most of his clothes and slide into the
  river and float down past the mill-would an entrance be found, or would the
  swimmer find himself drawn down the mill race into the ponderous sway of the
  wheel?</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be such a fool as to try the dodge, anyway," said Bill Naylor
  to himself.</p>

  <p>But in spite of these good and intelligent resolutions, he found himself
  standing finally on the bank of the stream, peering down at the mill. He
  could not see everything clearly; the bank hid a good deal. But now he was
  sitting down and pulling off his clothes!</p>

  <p>He stripped to a pair of drawers. In the water he would not want the
  weight of a heavy Colt revolver. Instead, he unfastened his hunting knife
  from his belt and took the leather sheath between his teeth. Then he waded
  into the stream. He took a last look around. He saw the stars coming out, and
  the greatness of the Blue Water Mountains, and the whirling of the river
  currents.</p>

  <p>"I'm the greatest fool in the world!" said Bill Naylor to himself.</p>

  <p>Then he dived into the water and swam down the stream. When he came close,
  he moored himself to the shore under a tangle of shrubbery. The mill was
  right above him. A yellow streak of lamplight came out of a window and
  rippled away across the water of the creek. The bumping and groaning of the
  wheel was not far away, and the voices of two men were talking.</p>

  <p>One of them said: "I says to Murphy: 'I don't like the turn of your nose
  and the color of your eye.' And Murphy, he says to me: 'I'm goin' to fix you
  so's you'll like 'em better.' And then we went at it, and the first thing I
  know, a gent standing by trips me up, and I go down flat and knock my wind
  out, and Murphy, he throws himself at me. He was so happy that he was howling
  like a dog. Whining and howling like a dog, sort of choked, because his teeth
  were grinding together. And I managed to turn around and bring up one knee,
  and the bone of my knee whanged him on the side of the chin, and it opened
  him up like a knife, and the blood was all over everything. Murphy yells out
  that I've cut his throat, and it looked like it. And he gets up and tries to
  run, and I get up, and the boys kick at Murphy and make him turn around and
  fight. But he was scared when he seen how much blood was running out of him,
  and he couldn't hardly hold up his hands. I took and beat the devil out of
  him. I got him against the wall, and the back of his head bumped the wall
  just when my fist hit his chin, and he went out like a light, and that's how
  he come to have that big cut on his chin, like you was talking about."</p>

  <p>"That's a good way to get a cut on the chin," said the other voice. "I
  heard tell that he was kicked by a hoss."</p>

  <p>The first speaker laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, he was kicked, all right. He was kicked by my knee, and it laid him
  right open like a knife."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I seen Murphy do in Las Gatas," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Have you got some pipe tobacco?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Wait till I get my pouch. Blast a pouch, anyway. When I just carried the
  sack the way I bought it, it was always in my pocket. But when I take and
  carry a pouch, I ain't never got it with me."</p>

  <p>The voice passed away, still speaking.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said the other. "I can tell you where Smithers left his
  tobacco down here in the basement."</p>

  <p>That voice, also, diminished, went out.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor pulled himself up through the shrubbery like an eel.</p>

  <p>"I'll take a look and know what the thing's like, and then I'll get out of
  here," he said to himself. Four men right out on guard. Six men, I'll tell
  Barry Christian. It's a job that even he wouldn't like to tackle.</p>

  <p>He found himself looking onto a sort of basement veranda that ran under
  the higher, main veranda overhead. The wet paddles of the mill wheel were
  rising, half revealed, a little to the right, each one coming up with a
  shudder of effort, like a living thing&mdash;shuddering, gleaming in the
  pallor of the lamp light, and almost stopping at the height of the rise, and
  then lurching foward again with renewed strength. Whatever work that wheel
  was doing, the utmost of its strength was being used.</p>

  <p>"Whatever they're doing, they ain't making flour," said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>Across the veranda he saw an open window and a closed door. The two men
  who had been talking had probably gone in through the door.</p>

  <p>"Some fools," said Bill Naylor, "would try to get in through that
  window."</p>

  <p>And then, as if in a story, he actually found himself quaking and
  shuddering, but peering through the window into a cluttered room that seemed
  to be filled with nothing but rags and scraps of old paper.</p>

  <p>He set his teeth. An electric chill which, he told himself, was like the
  chill of death, ran over him. A moment later he had ducked through the window
  and was stealing foward, cursing the rustling of the paper. A lantern, with
  the wick turned low, hung from the wall. He crossed the room, tried the
  opposite door, and found that it was not locked.</p>

  <p>He peeked through. There was nothing but darkness. It closed over him. It
  shut like water over his lips, and he could not breathe.</p>

  <p>"I'm a fool," Bill Naylor told himself. "What do I think I'm doing?"</p>

  <p>No voice of the spirit answered him.</p>

  <p>Of course, the thing for him to do was to get back quickly. Get back while
  the way was open.</p>

  <p>He started to open the door through which he had just passed, and inside
  of it he saw two men striding through the waste paper. He pressed the door
  soundlessly shut and leaned against the wall, his heart going fast.</p>

  <p>Suppose they found him, naked, dripping, what would he say? That he was
  searching for a parcel!</p>

  <p>Well, they'd give him a parcel. They'd give him a parcel of buckshot that
  would blow his head off, and the fish in Blue Water Creek could dine on what
  was left of him.</p>

  <p>"Fish food," said Bill Naylor. "That's what I am. Fish food. I'm such a
  fool that even the fish would laugh at me. That's what I am. I'm a simple
  fool, is all I am."</p>

  <p>He fumbled foward along the wall and opened another door. He got it ajar
  half an inch, and, peering through, he saw a little printing press at work,
  with a bearded, spectacled, clerical-looking gentleman leaning over one of
  its products, peering at it through a magnifying glass that was held close to
  his eye. Other products of the press were scattered on the floor, trampled
  brutally under foot, and yet all of them looked astonishingly like coin of
  the United States&mdash;neat little ten-dollar bills.</p>

  <p>That door slid out of the fingers of Bill Naylor and closed with a slight
  jarring sound. He knew where he was now. And he knew what sort of people make
  counterfeit money. Any one who has anything to do with the making or the
  pushing of the "queer" is apt to be a hardy soul.</p>

  <p>Well, if they found him in the place, they would simply finish him, that
  was all.</p>

  <p>He fumbled along the wall until his hip struck another doorknob. Carefully
  turning it, he opened upon another deep well of blackness. It seemed to him
  that it was deep, that a musty smell was rising to him from a great pit, and
  he put foward his bare foot with caution. The sole of his foot rubbed on the
  rough surface of bricks. He made another step, and another. There was no pit.
  That had been all something of the mind, a mere fiction.</p>

  <p>But there was something important, something significant about the bricks.
  Then he remembered. The floor of the cellar room about which Barry Christian
  had spoken was paved with bricks, not floored with wood or left as dank
  earth. He was in the very room, therefore, in which the parcel was
  hidden.</p>

  <p>Or were there two rooms paved with bricks?</p>

  <p>"Sure there are!" said Bill Naylor to his soul. "There's a thousand rooms
  paved with bricks in this place. And I could fumble a thousand years in the
  dark and not find anything."</p>

  <p>He wanted a smoke with a tremendous yearning. He felt that he could steady
  all his nerves and make his brain work if he could only smoke.</p>

  <p>He moistened his dry lips, found the wall, and began to feel his way along
  it. He encountered another door. Then he found a niche set back from the rest
  of the floor.</p>

  <p>That was the room! There was just such a corner niche in the room which
  Christian had described to him.</p>

  <p>He got down on his knees and began to try every brick. He tried a thousand
  bricks, and he could not budge one of them. He needed tools, he
  felt&mdash;took and lantern light.</p>

  <p>Then he used both hands and worked patiently, with strength, on every
  brick. The skin was rubbing off the tips of his fingers on the roughness of
  the bricks and the mortar, and then&mdash;a brick rocked a trifle under the
  pressure he gave it. A moment later it was up!</p>

  <p>Another and another gave way. He thrust his hand down into the cavity, and
  his hand touched the snaky, slippery smoothness of oiled silk. The hole was
  not big enough. He had to widen it still more before he stood up, trembling,
  with the prize in his hands.</p>

  <p>His brain was whirling so that he could not at once determine on a way to
  get out of the place. But at length he remembered his original course.</p>

  <p>He got through the door into the darkened room. Again, through a splinter
  of light, he recognized the apartment in which the press was kept; he could
  hear the muffled clanking of the machinery.</p>

  <p>They had nerve, fellows like these&mdash;right on the edge of a town to
  run a press like this and use the water power to operate it! They had brains
  and they had luck, or they would soon be closed down.</p>

  <p>He opened the door on the room whose floor was littered with waste paper.
  No man was in it. He went stealthily across the floor. There was the open
  window beyond which ran the veranda, and beyond the veranda was the black of
  the swirling river.</p>

  <p>He was nearly at the window when suddenly, without the sound of a door
  being opened, a voice behind him said:</p>

  <p>"Goin' to take a swim, Pete?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh," said Bill Naylor, and walked straight past the window to the
  door. He opened it as the man behind him said:</p>

  <p>"Watch out for the snags. I wouldn't swim this time of day, no matter what
  the chief says."</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor said nothing. He stepped out there into the darkness with one
  strong, yellow ray of lamplight from an upper window streaming down and
  rippling in pale gold across the face of the stream.</p>

  <p>The two who had been talking on the veranda were no longer there. Naylor
  slipped through the brush. He walked up the edge of the stream, crouching
  low, as if there were a strong sun to light him, and eyes spying on his every
  movement.</p>

  <p>He reached the horse. Still he could not believe that he had accomplished
  the thing.</p>

  <p>He donned his clothes and lighted a match to examine the contents of the
  parcel. Then he remembered his promise, that he would not look inside. He
  remembered, too, that priceless advice&mdash;to make a step at a time.</p>

  <p>Well, there was something in that. There was something in that worth more
  than gold and diamonds. The full beauty of the saying still was dawning on
  the soul of Bill Naylor. A step at a time, and he could climb all the
  mountains in the world.</p>

  <p>He wrapped up the parcel again, dropped it into a saddlebag, and
  mounted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; CROW'S NEST</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN he got back to the shack in the woods, two days later,
  in the afternoon, he found Barry Christian walking up and down in front of
  the lean-to, smoking a cigarette. Christian's greeting was a marvel of
  nonchalance.</p>

  <p>"Good time, brother?" was all he asked.</p>

  <p>"It was all right," said Bill Naylor, rejoicing in equal calm. "Those
  bozos are printing some queer up there. There's about a million of 'em
  littered all around."</p>

  <p>"Are there?" asked Christian indifferently.</p>

  <p>"And here's that parcel," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>Well, the nerves of Barry Christian were of the best steel, but the shock
  of pleasant suprise was too great for him to keep all emotion concealed. He
  could not help that flash of the eyes and that upward jerk of the head.</p>

  <p>He took the parcel and unwrapped it right under the eyes of Bill Naylor.
  It contained only three small packages. One was of unset jewels. The other
  two were well-compacted sheafs of greenbacks.</p>

  <p>Christian divided that loot into two heaps of equal size. Then he pushed
  them out on the top of a fallen log that lay across the door of the
  shack.</p>

  <p>"Take either half you want, Bill," said he.</p>

  <p>Naylor walked up to the treasure and stared down at it. Then he looked at
  Christian.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor felt that he was going to be a fool again. He could tell by
  the tremor of nerves up his spine. And suddenly the words came flooding out
  of his throat, past the unwilling tightness of his jaws.</p>

  <p>"You grabbed this honey, and you cached it," he said. "I just went and
  collected it for you; that's all."</p>

  <p>Barry Christian stared at him with troubled eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said Bill Naylor. "You take that and put it in your
  kick. I've had plenty of cash out of you already. Take that and forget about
  my little job."</p>

  <p>"No," said Christian in a queer, small voice. "I won't forget."</p>

  <p>He wrapped up the money slowly, his eyes fixed on the distance. There was
  something in all this which baffled the great Barry Christian. It might mean
  money in his pocket, but there was something about it that he did not
  like.</p>

  <p>Naylor wondered what it could be. There was something about what he
  himself had done&mdash;he, Bill Naylor&mdash;that Christian did not like. And
  that was strange! What had he done except do the most dangerous job he had
  ever tackled in his life? He had done that job, and he had got away with it.
  What more did Christian want?</p>

  <p>This problem disturbed the mind of Bill Naylor. He was shaken literally to
  his soul with wonder.</p>

  <p>He went off to cut some wood for the cooking of supper, and all the while
  that he was cutting the wood he was saying to himself: "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>But he solved the puzzle by merely deciding that he was just a "dumb mug,"
  and that the case was over his head.</p>

  <p>After supper they sat about in the gloaming, and he told Barry Christian
  everything. You could talk to a fellow like Christian. You could even say how
  afraid you were. With a fellow like Christian it was always better to be out
  in the open and not try to put anything over. So Bill Naylor didn't try to
  put anything over or play the hero. He told the truth.</p>

  <p>He found that it was pleasant to tell the truth. He had never talked so
  much truth before, in such a short space, in all the days of his life. When
  you tell the truth, you don't have to work the old brain. You just sit still
  and see things again the way they were. You see them clearly, and the
  re-seeing is a good deal of fun. He even told how he had repeated all the
  way: "A step at a time."</p>

  <p>"How old are you, Bill?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>"I'm old enough to know better."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm serious. How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty. Old enough to know a lot better."</p>

  <p>"Young enough to learn," said Christian. "Young enough to learn a
  lot."</p>

  <p>"A step at a time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Christian. "A step at a time, of course. Until you start
  jumping instead of stepping."</p>

  <p>And yet Christian did not seem altogether pleased. All through the story
  he was squinting at the narrator as though he were seeing things at a great
  distance. And Bill Naylor was amazed indeed.</p>

  <p>Before they turned in, Christian said: "You know Sheriff Dick
  Williams?"</p>

  <p>"That hombre back there in the Crow's nest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I know him. But what's more, he knows me."</p>

  <p>"Well, they have nothing on you just now."</p>

  <p>"No. But they can always dig something up. You know what they are
  like."</p>

  <p>"I know. But would you go and talk to him for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. And why not?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you drop in and see the sheriff and ask him what he would do if
  the ghost of Barry Christian dropped in and had a chat with him. And while
  you're in Crow's Nest, find out how things are going with Duff Gregor, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll make the trip tomorrow," said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>He went over the next morning, jogging his horse. He had a strange sense
  of comfort that ran all through his being. He felt indeed that he could look
  any man in the world in the eye? Why? Well, because he had fetched that
  parcel back to Christian without so much as looking at the contents&mdash;and
  because he had refused to take his split of the stolen money. He never had
  done such a thing before in all his days. He could not recognize himself. It
  seemed that a ghost wearing his name must have performed these things.</p>

  <p>When he got into the Crow's Nest, he saw the sunshine gleaming on the big
  hotels that faced each other from the divided peaks of the double mountain,
  and the town lying in the dimness of the hollow between.</p>

  <p>He went by the Merchants &amp; Miners Bank, which Henry Wilbur had built
  into such a great institution. Wilbur had done much for it, and the
  spectacular robbery which had been performed by Christian and Duff Gregor,
  parading as Jim Silver, had done still more. The robbery had advertised that
  bank all over the West, and men knew that Henry Wilbur had been on the point
  of sacrificing his personal fortune, and even his house and the books in his
  library for the sake of reimbursing his depositors. Well, such things make a
  bank strong. A good many people swore that they never would do banking of any
  kind from this time forward except through honest Henry Wilbur.</p>

  <p>Well, there is a strength in honesty. It keeps you out of jail, for one
  thing.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor thought of that as he pulled up his horse in front of the
  jail. He had dismounted, and was about to tie his horse at a hitch rack when
  the man he wanted spoke just beside him, saying:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Bill Naylor. I thought we'd always have to fetch you here. Didn't
  know that you'd come of your own accord!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; GATHERING NEWS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS Sheriff Dick Williams, looking as he always
  looked&mdash;sawed-off and strong and competent of body and mind. He had long
  ago come to the gray years when time changes the body of a man very slowly,
  and his face seems wiser, not older, from year to year.</p>

  <p>"Hey," answered Bill Naylor. "What's the main idea? You got nothing on me
  now, Williams."</p>

  <p>"Haven't I?" asked the sheriff, his eye twinkling. "Well, I don't suppose
  I have for the moment. But I can always trust you to start something new
  before long. What's it going to be this time, Bill? Old line or new?"</p>

  <p>Naylor rubbed his knuckles across his chin and frowned. He was neither
  complimented nor pleased by this banter. He had a feeling that the sheriff
  knew only part of him, and that there were other things he might show Dick
  Williams.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said. "I wanta talk to you about something."</p>

  <p>"Blaze away," said Dick Williams.</p>

  <p>"I was just going to ask you: Suppose that the ghost of somebody walked
  into your house some night, what would you do?"</p>

  <p>"Ask him to walk out again," said the sheriff. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose it was the ghost of Barry Christian?"</p>

  <p>"Christian!" gasped the sheriff.</p>

  <p>He kept staring at Naylor, and his eyes were as round as marbles. All at
  once he seemed a little boy with the mask of a middle-aged man set over his
  real features.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" demanded the Sheriff. "Barry Christian
  dropped off Kendal Bridge, and he went down the river&mdash;with his hands
  tied behind his back. And he went over the falls and was smashed to
  bits."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Bill Naylor. "I'm just asking you something. I'm not
  saying that while he was in the water he managed to get his hands free from
  the rope that tied his wrists together. I'm not saying that he snagged on a
  rock and managed to get past the falls. I'm only saying&mdash;if the ghost of
  Barry Christian walked in on you, what would you do? Would you talk?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff took a great breath.</p>

  <p>"Barry Christian!" he whispered. Then he added: "If Jim Silver hears that
  that devil has come out of the dead again, he'll lose his mind!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Naylor, "I asked you a question. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Talk to him? Why should I talk to him?" said the sheriff. "I've got guns,
  and I've got handcuffs. Why should I talk to him?"</p>

  <p>"That's the point," remarked Naylor. "Suppose that Christian was to walk
  in on you, would you want to talk to him&mdash;or something else?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the sheriff after a moment of hesitation, "I don't know. I
  don't know what I ought to do&mdash;about a ghost. Listen to me. If Barry
  Christian should walk into my house some night, I'd talk to him."</p>

  <p>"That's all I wanted to know," answered Bill Naylor, and he mounted and
  rode away.</p>

  <p>When he looked back, he saw the sheriff rooted to the same spot, shaking
  his head in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>At the First Chance Saloon, Bill Naylor paused to take refreshment. He
  stood at the bar, leaned his elbow upon it, and poured down two stiff drinks
  of whisky. After that he beckoned the bartender toward him. The bartender
  looked upon him with a judicial eye.</p>

  <p>"No credit," he said.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," said Naylor, and he pushed a ten-dollar bill over the
  counter.</p>

  <p>The bartender looked at that bill with attention. It was water-stained and
  pocket-chafed, but it seemed all right.</p>

  <p>"Got your girl's picture on it?" Bill Naylor sneered.</p>

  <p>"You know," said the bartender, "there's a lot of phony tens wandering
  around the country just now. A gent has gotta have an eye. But this looks all
  right to me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," growled Bill Naylor. "What's the news, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, about things. What's the news here in Crow's Nest?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," answered the other. "Things are going along pretty good.
  Everybody feels pretty fine since Jim Silver saved the bank. Then he went and
  faded out. You know that?"</p>

  <p>"I heard something about it. Why'd he do that? Somebody told me he was as
  good as married to Wilbur's daughter."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he was. They was around a lot together," said the bartender. "But
  you know how it is. It hurts Jim Silver to stay long in one spot. There's a
  sort of a curse on him. He's gotta keep moving. So one day he's here, and the
  next day he's gone, and who knows where?"</p>

  <p>"How's the girl feel about it?" asked Naylor.</p>

  <p>"I never asked her!" said the bartender shortly.</p>

  <p>Naylor understood. Since the recent great events, every one in Crow's Nest
  took a sort of family interest in Henry Wilbur and his daughter; just as
  Crow's Nest now felt that it had a sort of proprietarial claim to Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>"Well, I been and seen her once," said Bill Naylor. "She's got the kind of
  gray eyes that turn blue when a girl gets worked up. She's got the nerve all
  right."</p>

  <p>The bartender smiled faintly, as one who deprecates praise of a
  relative.</p>

  <p>"I seen her cut into the crowd when they was after Jim Silver," he said.
  "I seen her go sashaying right through the middle of 'em with gents trying to
  paw her off her horse. She saved Jim Silver that day. And now&mdash;well,
  nobody's seen her since Silver left the town. But what're you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>He was silent, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"There's Gregor in the jail," said Bill Naylor. "They'll chaw him up fine,
  I guess."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. He'll go down the throat. They got everything ready for him. His
  trial comes in three days. It'll be something like twenty years for Duff
  Gregor, I guess. That's what everybody says that oughta know. That's what the
  lawyers say. The town's hired a special fine lawyer to help the district
  attorney so's they can be sure to sock Gregor for everything that's coming to
  him."</p>

  <p>That was the news that Naylor carried back to Barry Christian. Christian
  moralized a little on the tidings about Silver and the girl. He said, in his
  deep, gentle, soothing voice:</p>

  <p>"The trouble with Jim Silver is that you never know where to have him.
  He's not like the rest of us."</p>

  <p>"A jump ahead, eh?" suggested Naylor with a grin.</p>

  <p>"He's beaten me three times," said Christian calmly. "But the fourth time
  I think I might win. I think I might take him by surprise, Bill. At any rate,
  I'm going to try."</p>

  <p>"Ain't there room for the two of you?" asked Bill Naylor. "Couldn't you
  get some place where he wouldn't reach you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Christian. "If I ran away, of course, there would be
  room for both of us."</p>

  <p>But by his manner of saying it, Bill Naylor knew very well that nothing in
  the world was farther from the mind of his companion than the thought of
  avoiding the conflict. He squinted his eyes as he thought of the
  thing&mdash;two giants, hand to hand. The day would come, and perhaps he,
  Bill Naylor, would be an eyewitness. For he felt that Barry Christian was
  going to take him into the presence of great events.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE SHERIFF'S TEMPTATION</h2>

  <p class="first">BACK in Crow's Nest, Sheriff Dick Williams paced the veranda
  of his cottage uneasily. Before him the town was spread out, filling the
  hollow hand of the night with a glow, and uneven sparklings, and long rows of
  lights. But this picture, which had so often delighted him, he could not see
  now.</p>

  <p>Every time he walked past the open front door of his house, the stream of
  the lamplight from the lamp which burned on the hall table struck him and
  illumined him sharply.</p>

  <p>At any other time he would have known better than to expose himself in
  this manner, for there were plenty of straight shots in the mountains who
  would have liked nothing better than a chance to send a little chunk of lead
  through Dick Williams. His course as sheriff had been a little too straight.
  He had made too many enemies by the steadiness of his honesty.</p>

  <p>But this evening there were too many burdens on his mind for him to think
  of his own danger.</p>

  <p>He went back into the house with a quiet step, turned the knob of a door
  cautiously, and peered inside. There was a screen surrounding the bed.
  Outside the screen, in the dim field of light from a lamp whose wick was
  turned very low, sat the sheriff's wife, sewing, bending her head low to see
  the stitches.</p>

  <p>She looked up at her husband with a smile. She had never been more than
  vaguely pretty. Now the time and work and care had tightened her face here
  and loosened it there, and printed black-and-purple circles around the eyes.
  But when the sheriff looked at her he never saw the modern fact of her, but
  the ancient and pleasant myth which had made him love her in the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>Behind the screen the child stirred and moaned.</p>

  <p>The sheriff shrank back a little in the doorway. He could always feel the
  voice of the child somewhere inside him. It made him sick with fear. It made
  him want to run away.</p>

  <p>He saw his wife get up, put down her sewing, and pass behind the screen.
  She spoke, so softly that he could not understand the words, though he well
  knew the voice that uttered them. He could remember a like voice out of his
  own childhood.</p>

  <p>There was a sleepy murmuring, and then Mrs. Williams came out from behind
  the screen again and smiled once more.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The sheriff blinked.</p>

  <p>"No," he said.</p>

  <p>"You ought to see him," said his wife. "He's a little better tonight. The
  doctor says he's a little better. You ought to see him, Dick. You'll feel a
  lot better if you see him more often."</p>

  <p>He drew in a soft breath.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, shaking his head. "The morning's my time to see him. I'll
  see him in the morning. How are you?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Oh, I'm all right. I never was better."</p>

  <p>"You're all right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am."</p>

  <p>She went back to her sewing and sat with it in her lap, still smiling at
  him while he stood helplessly in the doorway. But after a time he backed out
  and closed the door, and went on tiptoe down the hall.</p>

  <p>It was no more true that she was "all right" than it was that the boy was
  "a little better." Women are sure to lie like that&mdash;good women are, at
  least. They keep smiling and let the pain go inward and consume the
  heart.</p>

  <p>The sheriff returned to his veranda and paced slowly up and down it. If he
  had given up smoking and an occasional drink two years ago, and cut down on
  everything and saved every penny, by this time they would have enough money
  to do what the doctor wanted them to do with the boy. Seaside air might be
  very good for the child. But as matters stood, the seaside was as far outside
  the range of the pocketbook of the sheriff as the blue and gold of
  heaven.</p>

  <p>"You don't dig much money with a six-shooter," the sheriff thought. It was
  an old thought of his. He had been a fighting man&mdash;on the side of the
  law&mdash;for the half of his life, now. And he never had made money. "You
  don't dig money with a six-shooter." Nothing could be truer than that.</p>

  <p>Just as that thought worked in his mind, things began to happen fast. A
  low voice called:</p>

  <p>"Hello, sheriff."</p>

  <p>He stopped walking. He put a hand on a gun before he remembered that any
  one with a mind to do so might have picked him off twenty times during the
  last twenty minutes.</p>

  <p>He stepped to the edge the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said he.</p>

  <p>And the voice said: "Will you come down here from the veranda and talk to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Barry Christian."</p>

  <p>The hair stirred on the scalp of the sheriff. He remembered the words that
  had been spoken to him by Bill Naylor. Then, gathering his strength, he
  walked down from the veranda and along the narrow path into the garden. A
  tall figure suddenly appeared beside him.</p>

  <p>It was Barry Christian. He knew that somehow with a perfect certainty. It
  wasn't that he had been told that it was Barry Christian who wanted to talk
  with him. That didn't matter. What mattered was that an inner sense gave him
  warning.</p>

  <p>He made no move toward a gun now, not only because he was afraid, but
  because he remembered his promise to talk.</p>

  <p>So he stopped short and merely said: "Well, Christian?"</p>

  <p>"I thought that I'd like to have a chat with you," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"Here I am," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Just about things," said Christian. "About the boy, for instance. How's
  Dick Williams, Jr.?"</p>

  <p>"He's all right," answered the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"That's not what the doctor says."</p>

  <p>"How do you know what the doctor says?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a fellow happens to hear things now and then. I've heard that
  little Dick needs a change of air."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, too," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is. All right for you and me. But how about little Dick? How
  all right is it for him?"</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to him," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Sure you will. You'll attend to him. You'll attend to his funeral, you
  mean."</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," answered Christian, "I've dropped around to have a chat."</p>

  <p>"I've had enough of your chatting. Get out of my sight, Christian, and
  don't come back again."</p>

  <p>"Hard lines, Dick Williams. Hard fines," murmured the soft voice of Barry
  Christian. "I'll tell 'you what I'll do. I'll step away and leave you to
  yourself for a few minutes. I'll leave you to look at a little trifle that I
  brought you. Not for you, but for little Dick. Understand? I'm fond of
  children, sheriff."</p>

  <p>He chuckled as he said this. It sounded to the sheriff like the mirth of a
  fiend.</p>

  <p>"Take this," said Christian. "Give it a look, and I'll drop by again in
  five minutes."</p>

  <p>He handed the sheriff a flat, paper-wrapped package; then he stepped into
  the brush. The sheriff raised the package to hurl after the criminal, but his
  hand was stopped by another thought.</p>

  <p>He went up on the veranda, unwrapped the paper, and found inside what he
  had guessed at before by the pinch of his thumb and forefinger. It was a
  good, thick sheaf of money. He counted out five thousand dollars in excellent
  currency of the country.</p>

  <p>He loosed his collar and sat there for a time, breathing hard. Oh, he knew
  what it meant, well enough. Up yonder in the jail was Duff Gregor, a few
  steps away from twenty years of darkness. And here in the hand of the sheriff
  there was five thousand dollars in hard cash. He could send his wife and
  youngster to a place where the boy would grow well, where they would both
  regain their strength. He could manage some tale&mdash;about borrowing money,
  or a business deal. There were plenty of stories that he could tell. And when
  she came back, brown, rosy, stepping lightly, with the boy a bundle of
  healthy energy&mdash;well, what would he care about the source of the
  money?</p>

  <p>As far as Duff Gregor was concerned&mdash;well, what was Duff Gregor,
  other than the most helpless of tools in the hand of Barry Christian?
  Christian had planned the crime and merely used the face of Gregor to perform
  it&mdash;the mere chance that Gregor so strikingly resembled Jim Silver. If
  Gregor were turned loose from the jail, what real harm would be done?</p>

  <p>So the sheriff argued with himself. Then a soft step approached up the
  gravel of the path and paused at a sufficient distance to remain covered by
  the dark of the night.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said the gentle voice of Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>The sheriff started to speak, found himself breathless, and moistened his
  dry lips.</p>

  <p>Then, instead of saying a word, he threw the sheaf of money down on the
  gravel path and went back inside the house. He sat on the side of his bed,
  trembling. He was afraid every moment that there would be a tap at the front
  door, and that Barry Christian would be there again to start bargaining. But
  there was no tap at the front door.</p>

  <p>He went to bed, but he could not sleep for a long time. He could only go
  half a step into the region of nightmares before he was recalled again to the
  land of wakefulness and living horrors.</p>

  <p>Once, as full consciousness returned to him, he saw a white form seated
  beside the window, and he knew that it was his wife sitting there,
  thinking.</p>

  <p>He got out of bed and put his hand on her bare shoulder. Her flesh was
  dank and cold, like the coolness of dead bodies. He told her to get into bed,
  that she would have to sleep.</p>

  <p>She said, without looking up: "I don't want to go to bed. I don't want to
  admit the day has ended."</p>

  <p>Well, he understood that, too. If this day ended, Heaven alone could tell
  what the next day would bring. The next day might be the last day for which
  they were waiting. The next day might not dawn at all for little Dick.</p>

  <p>"Things are going to be all right," said the sheriff. "You go to bed. I'll
  go in and sit there with Dickie."</p>

  <p>"You sit there? Are you out of your head? Have you lost your mind?" she
  exclaimed. "What are you thinking of? Take care of your crooks and thugs and
  jailbirds, but let Dickie alone. Unless you want to frighten him into the
  grave."</p>

  <p>She never had talked like this before. She would not be talking like this
  now, he knew, except that she was strained to the breaking point. He stood
  back in a corner, silent, until she snapped at him:</p>

  <p>"Go back to bed! I don't want you here. You're no comfort to him."</p>

  <p>He said nothing. Perhaps it was not all nerves, he told himself. Perhaps
  she meant what she said. Perhaps she never had cared much about him. Women
  can do that; they can cover up the truth for years and years. In great
  criminal cases you find women who are capable of acting like that.</p>

  <p>So his heart grew old and small in him as he considered the dreadful
  possibilities of her unknown mind.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to bed?" she snapped again.</p>

  <p>"When you do," he told her.</p>

  <p>She got up. He thought that she was going to throw herself at his throat.
  Instead, she ran to the bed and flung herself into it, face down. He went to
  the bed and covered her up. She began to cry softly. Now and then a great sob
  would break out. She fought with writhings of the body to keep the noise
  inside her for fear lest it might disturb the boy in the next room.</p>

  <p>"Don't let me make a noise! Don't wake him up!" she said.</p>

  <p>The sheriff put his hand on her bare, cold shoulder, and sat silently in
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>After a time the sobbing ceased. She lay panting, and out of her panting
  she said finally:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dick, my heart's broken! Nothing can save him. He's worse every
  day."</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me. I'm going to do something," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>She made a moaning sound for an answer. They spoke no more. He pulled a
  chair up beside the bed and sat in it all night long, without sleeping. He
  put his hand on the bed. Sometimes she caught at the hand in her sleep and
  clung to it. At other times she threw it away.</p>

  <p>In the morning the sheriff bathed in a tub of cold water, shaved, dressed,
  and went down to the jail. He walked up and down the cell aisles. There were
  twenty men in the jail this morning. Half of them were disturbers of the
  peace; half of them were old offenders. He looked all of those old offenders
  in the eye and decided that his criticism of them in the past had always been
  rather too harsh.</p>

  <p>He was so full of thoughts on this day that he could hardly give attention
  to a single item of business.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon word came in that young Crowley was over in the
  First Chance Saloon smashing things up dead drunk, and crazier than ever. The
  peculiarity of young Crowley was that the more drunk he grew, the straighter
  he shot.</p>

  <p>But the sheriff did not wait to raise a posse. He did not even take a gun.
  He got up from his office chair and went right over the way he was,
  bare-headed, and went into the First Chance Saloon, smiling faintly.</p>

  <p>Young Crowley stood down at the other end of the bar and fired three
  bullets. One of them clipped a lock off the head of the sheriff. But that
  didn't matter. It was simply a relief to have something to do with his hands,
  the sheriff thought. And he went up to Crowley and put a hand on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to break you open," said Crowley.</p>

  <p>"Sure you are," agreed the sheriff, "but you're coming along with me
  first, so that we can have a quiet little talk together."</p>

  <p>"If anybody tries to keep us from having a talk," said Crowley, "I'll salt
  'em down with lead."</p>

  <p>So the sheriff walked him harmlessly back to the jail and took the weapons
  away from him and locked him up. Afterward, as Crowley lay face downward on
  the cot in his cell, snoring loudly, the sheriff stood by and looked at him
  with an almost envious eye.</p>

  <p>Crowley had simply been breaking the peace in a rather obnoxious manner.
  That was all that Crowley would have to answer for in the court. There would
  be nothing important on the mind or the conscience of Crowley. And the
  sheriff?</p>

  <p>Well, Heaven alone could tell what he would have to answer for before
  another day was chalked up on the calendar.</p>

  <p>When he got home that night he could hardly eat his supper, because young
  Dick was having a choking and coughing fit, and in between the spells the
  sheriff could hear him panting. Mrs. Williams kept running back and forth
  between the dining room and the sick boy. But she was very cheerful and
  affectionate. She kept smiling and shining her eyes at the sheriff. And the
  sheriff understood. She was making amends for her behavior of the night
  before.</p>

  <p>As if she needed to make amends! As if she could not spend the rest of her
  life kicking him in the face!</p>

  <p>Well, after supper he went out into the darkness of the veranda and sat
  still, smoking his pipe.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of wealth in the world. There was plenty of money right
  there in Crow's Nest. And he knew how to get it.</p>

  <p>If people paid a man the salary of a dog catcher and asked him to take the
  duties of a sheriff, what could they expect of him?</p>

  <p>Then he heard a soft voice say out of the darkness: "Evening, sheriff. May
  I have a chat with you?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff closed his eyes and knew that this was the softness of the
  voice of the devil, uttering temptation. He stood up, his eyes still half
  closed, and blundered down the steps and into the garden path.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; GREGOR'S ESCAPE</h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTIAN, walking jauntily up and down in front of the
  little cabin in the woods near the town of Kendal, said: "Now, Bill, it's
  time that we should begin to do something."</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor sat on a stump whittling at a piece of soft white pine which
  furled away from the edge of his sharp knife in translucent slivers. He
  squinted at his whittling as though he were trying to make sure that the
  stick was shaping straight and true; in reality, he was thinking about his
  ride to Blue Water, and wondering what Barry Christian meant by "doing
  something" if that trip to Blue Water had not been "something."</p>

  <p>Then he regarded the tall body and the long, pale, handsome face of Barry
  Christian, so full of mobility and expression.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>A squirrel came out on a branch and chattered down at them, bobbing its
  tail as rapidly as it barked. Christian with a fluid gesture, produced an
  oversized Colt from under his coat and shot the squirrel off the branch. It
  dropped at a distance, a red smudge on the pine needles. Naylor stopped
  whittling and regarded that little blur against the ground. Even children in
  that part of the world could take a squirrel out of a tree with a rifle, but
  revolver work was another matter. The great feats of revolver marksmanship
  were generally talked about, and rarely seen.</p>

  <p>Christian said: "Now we can talk in quiet&mdash;and in private, eh?"</p>

  <p>The remark pleased Naylor very little. The laughter pleased him not at
  all. There were certain features in the character of the great Barry
  Christian which were not ideal. That, in short, was the truth, though Bill
  Naylor still valiantly strove to close his eyes to the unpleasant truth. Of
  course, the man was a criminal, but he must be a great, important, classic
  example of crime, not one to do casual murder even on a squirrel.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor forcibly removed his mind from these thoughts.</p>

  <p>"All right, chief," said he. "We'll do something, then."</p>

  <p>"In the first place," said Christian, "we must pick up Duff Gregor."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Naylor. "All we gotta do is to break the jail, and then,
  after we've unlocked his cell and taken off his irons, we can pick him up.
  That oughta be easy."</p>

  <p>His irony had small effect on Barry Christian, who merely said:</p>

  <p>"Well, it may not be so complicated. Let me tell you what I'd like to have
  you do."</p>

  <p>"Fire away," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"First I want you to go through town&mdash;Kendal, yonder&mdash;and buy a
  good, fast, tough mustang. Then I want you to drift down to Crow's Nest."</p>

  <p>"Right."</p>

  <p>"You know the southwest corner of the vacant lot the jail stands in, in
  Crow's Nest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know."</p>

  <p>"Go there with your two horses after dark, and wait in the grove of
  saplings. Pretty soon a man will walk into those trees and call out in a
  quiet voice, 'Barry!' You will answer 'Waiting!' Can you remember that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Who will the man be?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the man will be Duff Gregor."</p>

  <p>"The devil he will be!"</p>

  <p>"Not the devil. Just Duff Gregor. There's plenty of bluff, but not much
  devil in Duff Gregor."</p>

  <p>"How'll he get out of the jail? Bribery?"</p>

  <p>"What a thing to say!" replied Christian. "Bribery? How could that be? No,
  no. Gregor will break out at a time when the sheriff is in the jail all by
  himself. At a time when the sheriff, in fact, has made sure that all is well,
  and has gone into his office to do some paper work. At that time the door of
  the cell of Gregor will push open, just as though the sheriff had unlocked
  it. And Gregor will steal out, just as if the sheriff had thrown him the key
  for his manacles. Gregor will go to the side door, and with another key he'll
  unlock that. And then he'll step out into the night and walk straight to you.
  Understand?"</p>

  <p>"By thunder," said Naylor, "you even managed to get to Dick Williams? You
  can do anything, then!"</p>

  <p>"Give me a purse of the right size and I'll find any man's price," boasted
  Christian. "It's simple enough. But you'll be there with two horses waiting,
  and you and Gregor will ride out of Crow's Nest&mdash;keeping to the by
  lanes&mdash;and head straight on down the valley till you come to the river.
  You'll trail along beside the river till you reach the island. You'll
  probably be able to wade the horses across to the island. If not, and if the
  river's high and fast, you can swim them across. When you reach the island,
  I'll probably be there, waiting for you. If not, take the trail I told you
  about to that deserted ranch. Better take along some provisions in case we
  need 'em later."</p>

  <p>"I'll do what you say," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem happy about it, Bill," suggested Barry Christian. "What's
  the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Aw, I'm happy enough. I'm just wondering where the whole job is
  heading."</p>

  <p>"As long as you work with me, old-timer," said Christian, "you can always
  be sure that every job is heading for easy money."</p>

  <p>"Unless there's a Jim Silver in the way."</p>

  <p>From Christian there was a silence after this remark. Bill Naylor, rather
  frightened by the silence, stood up and prepared to leave at once. He
  promised himself that he would make no more cracks about the great Jim
  Silver&mdash;not in the presence of Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>So, saddling his mustang, Bill Naylor started at once for Kendal town,
  first rehearsing to Christian exactly what he should do. All of the
  instructions were firmly in his mind before he left, and he jogged the
  patient mustang through the sweeping shadows of the pine woods and out into
  the blue and green and gold of the open day.</p>

  <p>In Kendal he got an excellent mustang, mean, but as tough as leather. The
  meaner the mustang, the more wear to it, is a regular precept in the
  West.</p>

  <p>He made a few purchases of provisions in Kendal, and then resumed the
  journey in a very leisurely manner. In fact, he had to kill two hours in
  idleness outside of Crow's Nest before the coming of sunset, when he was free
  to enter the town.</p>

  <p>As he passed down the streets and saw the lamplight streaking out of the
  houses, he kept saying to himself that behind every house there was the
  fortune and the strength of a most corruptible man. If Dick Williams had been
  bought, then any man could be bought, and Barry Christian was right. Every
  man in the world could be bought, except, let us say, Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>And he was a freak. He didn't count!</p>

  <p>When Naylor came to the big vacant space in the center of which the jail
  stood, it was pitch-dark. All the houses were subdued, and only occasional
  voices came drifting through the open windows from supper tables.</p>

  <p>In the dark of the grove of saplings he waited, holding the lead ropes of
  the two horses. He grew tired of standing, and sat down on his heels, then
  cross-legged, like an Indian.</p>

  <p>He expected to hear an outbreak of shouting from the jail, first of all,
  since it did not seem possible that even with the sheriff's connivance a
  criminal could escape without making some disturbance. Instead, it happened
  exactly as the great Barry Christian had predicted. There was simply the
  sound of a quiet voice, calling, in a tone that could not be heard more than
  ten steps away: "Barry! Barry!"</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor could have whistled with surprise. It proved to him that Barry
  Christian, when he laid a plan, knew how to have one part dovetail with
  another.</p>

  <p>Naylor gave the answer, and instantly a dim shadow appeared before him
  among the trees as he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You're from what?" asked the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Barry. And you're Duff?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" gasped the stranger. "Shut up, you fool!"</p>

  <p>Naylor grinned into the darkness. After all, Gregor had not been spending
  time in jail for fun, and it was no wonder that his nerves were a little bit
  frayed out.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Naylor. "Here's your pony. Here, on the near side.
  Mind&mdash;it's likely to pitch. I took out most of the kinks to-day, but
  there may still be a few left."</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor mounted. He was so big that he made the horse look small as a
  pony indeed. But no wonder he was big. A man who passed for Jim Silver had to
  have inches, at the least.</p>

  <p>Naylor repeated the instructions in a quiet voice.</p>

  <p>The only remark of Gregor was: "The island in the lower river is too close
  to Crow's Nest. A thousand miles is what ought to be between me and this
  town. They're all going to be out on my trail before half an hour."</p>

  <p>Naylor led the way out of the trees. They jogged across the lot, turned
  down an alley toward the left, and then made the first right turn, and as
  they entered this new lane, bad luck overtook them.</p>

  <p>A house door beside them swung open suddenly, and as a pair of men came
  out, the shaft of the lamplight struck full on Gregor. The mustang, startled,
  reared up, and in so doing, held Gregor in the light for an instant and
  caused the brim of his sombrero to flare away from his face.</p>

  <p>As the horse pitched forward again, well-ridden, a voice said from the
  porch of the house:</p>

  <p>"That's Jim Silver, by thunder!"</p>

  <p>And the other voice gasped: "No, that's Duff Gregor&mdash;out of
  jail!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; THE PURSUIT</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL NAYLOR felt that it might be only a guess that would be
  lost in the darkness of the night; he kept his horse to a dog-trot and
  muttered to big Duff Gregor to do the same, but a moment later a gun exploded
  three times, and two wild voices yelled in chorus:</p>

  <p>"Turn out! Turn out! Gregors on the loose! Duff Gregor's on his way!"</p>

  <p>Could the devil himself have planned the thing more perfectly? Could that
  door have been opened more inopportunely?</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to spur the horses. They went through the
  rest of Crow's Nest at a dead run, and behind them, whirling up into the sky,
  floating dimly in their ears, was the racket of the gathering pursuit.</p>

  <p>For the people of Crow's Nest were not such city dwellers that they had
  become pedestrians. In front of nearly every house there was sure to be at
  least one horse tethered. And every man, almost, carried a gun. In ten
  seconds a man seated quietly at his supper table could be under way, riding
  like mad in a chase. It was like tapping a wasp's nest and then trying to get
  away, with the wasps in hot pursuit of the first moving object.</p>

  <p>The uproar spread as fast as they could ride; and as they shot out of town
  and took the dangerous, long down grade toward the bottom of the valley
  beyond, a man who had run out of his house at the sound of the shouting
  dropped to one knee and opened on the two fugitives with a rifle. They
  whirled by some trees, and heard the bullets fly among the branches.</p>

  <p>Luckily they had two good horses which could run and stand the gaff for a
  long time. How good they would prove matched against the very best that the
  young bloods of Crow's Nest could bring into the field remained to be seen.
  The bulk of Duff Gregor made Bill Naylor shake his head.</p>

  <p>They got down the slope with the pursuit thundering halfway down the hill
  behind them. Now they had either a straight road to follow, or else there
  were the open fields toward the river. The road was too dangerous, for at any
  time they might run into a party of riders from the opposite direction and be
  hailed to stop. So they took to the fields at the shouted advice of
  Naylor.</p>

  <p>The turf was good; the ground was firm; the horses flew along with doubled
  speed. The cool, sweet smell of the grass came off the ground. The night had
  no moon. Before them they could see patches of trees here and there, and
  willows receded far from the bank of the river now and again, marking out
  marshy places. If it came to a pinch, they might be able to hide in one of
  those patches and try to swim the river.</p>

  <p>The river, however, was by no means a promising sight. Usually it kept
  well behind its banks, but there must have been a freshet somewhere among its
  tributaries in the higher mountains, for now the starlight glistened on wide,
  still flats of standing water, where the stream had overflowed. Twice their
  horses spattered through the edges of these floods, and half bogged down in
  the steep going.</p>

  <p>Behind them came the men of Crow's Nest. Bill Naylor saw them spread out
  like a great fan, which kept growing longer and longer in the handle as the
  slower riders fell back and the faster ones with a later start speeded up
  from behind.</p>

  <p>Naylor shook his head. By the way the head of that fan was creeping up on
  them, he could tell what sort of horses and riders there were in the outfit.
  He could almost see the beauty of the horses and the keen riders leaning
  forward to jockey the utmost speed out of the mounts.</p>

  <p>If Barry Christian had been there&mdash;well, what could even a Barry
  Christian think of a time like that? The paralyzing fear of flight began to
  thicken the blood of Bill Naylor. Once he jerked out a revolver and turned
  with a beastly, snarling desire to fire blindly back at the pursers.</p>

  <p>Something stopped his hand. Besides, if it came to shooting the thing out
  at close range, he would want well-filled chambers in his guns.</p>

  <p>Then the horse of Duff Gregor stumbled, groaned like a stricken man, and
  went on, limping heavily.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a cheap plug did you bring me?" yelled Gregor. "They're
  goin' to get me They're goin' to swallow me up again. You bring me a cheap,
  second-hand plug like this and expect me to do anything with it?"</p>

  <p>Naylor said nothing. His whirling mind could not evolve any words, but
  gallantly he pulled down the gait of his own horse to the labored strivings
  of Gregor's mustang. Behind them the men of Crow's Nest ever were looming
  larger and larger.</p>

  <p>If only the Indian yelling would stop! But it increased each instant,
  rising in a wild chorus of joy. Guns exploded rapidly. They were not aimed at
  the fleeing pair; they were fired in mere excess of happiness as the riders
  found the quarry coming into their hand.</p>

  <p>Then Naylor knew the one thing that remained for them to try. He waved
  toward the river and yelled:</p>

  <p>"Take to the water!"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather hang than drown!" shouted Duff Gregor.</p>

  <p>Well, it looked like that, right enough. Even the starlight was enough to
  show the dangerous face of the river, the irregular swirling of the currents,
  and here and there a rifle lifting from the surface like the fin of a great
  fish.</p>

  <p>But it was the only thing.</p>

  <p>Once, with a crew of other youngsters, Bill Naylor ran down a wounded deer
  until it took to the rapid of a river that was more white water than blue. He
  remembered how the beautiful animal remained for an instant on the bank,
  pointing its nose at the sky and trailing the sweep of its horns over its
  back. Then, despairingly, it leaped. It swam well. Bill Naylor, from the
  bank, secretly hoped that it would safely make the ford. But his companions,
  savagely yelling, opened fire on the small, struggling head and
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>No bullets hit. No bullets were needed. In the center of the stream the
  current suddenly mastered the poor fugitive and sent it whirling down to the
  cascade.</p>

  <p>Well, this was very much like that. There was no real safety in the water,
  but treacherous currents were better than the rifles and the jails of savage
  men.</p>

  <p>So Naylor swung straight in toward the bank, crying:</p>

  <p>"This way or no way. Don't be a fool, Gregor!"</p>

  <p>A stream of howling curses answered him, but Gregor obediently followed,
  driving his lamed horse right at the bank.</p>

  <p>It was not two feet above the top of the flood. The good mustang that
  carried Naylor knew water as well as land, and dipped one step down the bank,
  then lunged far out into the current. Slipping out of the saddle, he took the
  horse by the tail and swam with kicking feet and with the strokes of his
  other hand.</p>

  <p>He looked back. Already an immensity of water seemed to stretch between
  him and the shore. That water had the sheen of polished metal. But metal
  cannot give back such shifting and changing lights.</p>

  <p>He saw the lame horse of Duff Gregor swimming only a little to his rear.
  He could make out the head quite clearly, and the flaring of the nostrils and
  the pricking of the gallant ears. Lame or not, it seemed able to swim as well
  as Naylor's horse. Behind it there was a good deal of threshing and foaming
  as Duff Gregor worked to get himself faster through the water.</p>

  <p>Then monsters came and danced with gigantic leaps along the shore, their
  double bodies heaving up and down against the stars. Those were the men of
  Crow's Nest, of course. But they looked like creatures out of a fable, and
  larger, by far, than human.</p>

  <p>Naylor turned his face forward. It would not help his swimming to see the
  darting fires from the muzzles of the rifles. Therefore he turned, and worked
  steadily and strongly. His good mustang, in the meantime, had pointed its
  head a little upstream and was fighting like a Trojan.</p>

  <p>A whirling bit of driftwood swept by, its speed showing how well the horse
  was stemming the current of the stream. And now something like a great water
  serpent went by, rolling, making a swishing sound in the river. It was not a
  serpent. It was a great log whose branches had been stripped away far up the
  course of the river.</p>

  <p>Jets of water began to whip across the head and shoulders of Naylor as he
  swam. He knew they were driven by the impact of the rifle bullets that
  showered on the stream. He could hear the clangor of the guns. But death by
  bullets seemed less dreadful than the black coilings of the water in which he
  floated. Sometimes hands seemed to pluck at him and pull him down. And again
  and again big logs came hurtling, or low-flying bits of wreckage of one sort
  or another.</p>

  <p>Something approached him with the howling voice of a spirit from among the
  damned. He made out, at last, a flat bit of wreckage, like the door of a
  house, and on it a small dog complaining to the stars.</p>

  <p>Then, drawn by the shadow of oncoming danger, he glanced to the left and
  saw peril sweeping toward him straight as an arrow, a gigantic log that
  lifted a great blank face to beat him down into the dark confusion and death
  beneath the waters.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; ON THE ISLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no way of dodging the log. The mustang, blind with
  effort, was unable to be controlled. Naylor could not pull himself forward
  quickly enough to get hand on the reins. All he could do was to watch that
  looming destruction grow greater and greater, until at the last it struck
  down the mustang into the depths. Naylor, casting himself free from the tail
  of the horse, caught at a broken bough that threatened him as with the point
  of a spear. For the tree trunk was coming down tip first.</p>

  <p>As he got his grip on the stub of the branch, the entire log turned
  rapidly. He was dragged through stifling darkness and brought up on top,
  where he dragged in a great breath of air and saw the whirling white lines of
  the stars steady again to single points of fire. Next he saw Duff Gregor in
  the very act of being overwhelmed by the log. The horse that helped Gregor
  through the river was struck by the irresistible weight of the log and
  knocked under.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor thought seven long thoughts in the course of half a second. He
  cursed himself and his folly&mdash;then he twisted his legs around the branch
  by which he had been lifted to safety, and, stretching out to his full
  length, he grabbed blindly in the swirl of the current. He grabbed at a
  shadow and closed a hand on cloth. He pulled hard. The log, slowly turning,
  gained impetus and dragged him under. Still he maintained his hold. The tree
  trunk turned very slowly. The effort he was making made it impossible to hold
  his breath long. He was about to let go his hold when two frantic hands
  clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"I'm done," he said to himself. "I'm pulled under and gone like a water
  rat!"</p>

  <p>Then the log, slowly, slowly revolving, dragged him up dripping to the
  starlight once more, and to the incredible mercy of the sweet open air.</p>

  <p>Big Duff Gregor came with him and clutched the body of the tree trunk with
  frantic arms and legs. He groaned and gasped with every breath he drew. There
  was something so clumsy and desperate, at once, about the way Duff Gregor was
  clutching at his liberty that Naylor cursed him savagely, and then wanted to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>The log, as though it realized that turning and twisting would no longer
  get rid of the two human lives that clung to it, stopped rolling. Off to the
  side, Naylor saw the dark cavalcade of horsemen riding along the bank, still
  firing.</p>

  <p>He lay flat. He gripped the roughness of the bark and hoped the darkness
  would shelter him, because there was still a spasmodic rifle fire, and he
  could hear the bullets slash the water. One of the slugs thudded hard into
  the trunk of the tree inches from his hand.</p>

  <p>Before him, Gregor began to sit up straight.</p>

  <p>"Lie flat!" demanded Naylor.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor lay flat again.</p>

  <p>Naylor said: "Lie flat and don't move. Who are you that everybody should
  make such a fuss to give you a hand? Who are you to be dragged out of
  trouble? Lie flat and keep flat."</p>

  <p>Something urged and swelled in his soul as he saw the big man lie still.
  Naylor wanted to laugh. To think that he had such control over such a
  celebrated character as this Duff Gregor, who had the effrontery to play the
  part of Jim Silver!</p>

  <p>Jim Silver? Multiply this rascal by ten and he would still lack ten parts
  of being a Jim Silver. Size doesn't make the man. Naylor thought greedily of
  that, taking comfort in his more abbreviated inches. Brains make the man. He
  himself was no colossus of the world of thought, but he had a brain, just the
  same. Barry Christian would testify to that.</p>

  <p>The rifle fire stopped suddenly, as if a command had been given. The dark
  silhouettes of the forms along the bank pooled together. Perhaps they had
  noticed that the horses were gone, and took it for granted that the riders
  were gone, also. Perhaps this was the end of the pursuit.</p>

  <p>A storm was blowing up. It was just conceivable that this might have
  something to do with influencing the minds of the men of Crow's Nest. Already
  the stars to the northwest were wiped out. That might be the same storm which
  had filled the higher valley with surging torrents and started the river
  flooding. Now it loosed itself suddenly from its birthplace and rolled south
  and east across the sky. The wind that foreran it blew cold on the wet body
  of Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>As he looked to the side, he saw that the troop was keeping pace with the
  drifting of the log. No, now it was turning and scattering. And just before
  him he saw the loom of the island, like a low-lying bank of mist. To either
  side of it the bright arcs of the river poured.</p>

  <p>"Get ready!" he called. "We're going to swim for the island when we're a
  little closer."</p>

  <p>"Swim nothing," answered Duff Gregor. "Ride the horse that knows the way
  home. Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Don't argue, but do as I tell you!" commanded Naylor. He rejoiced
  tyrannically that he was able to command.</p>

  <p>But still Gregor was arguing.</p>

  <p>"We're all right," he said. "Why not stick to the log?"</p>

  <p>"Dummy! Because Barry Christian wants to meet us on the island."</p>

  <p>"It's a bad play," said Gregor. "They've got the island spotted now.
  They'll be sure to give it a search."</p>

  <p>"They've gone home," answered Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Only up the bank to get boats, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Hey, d'you know better than Christian?" answered Naylor furiously.</p>

  <p>Personally, he would like to meet any man in the world fit to argue a
  point or make a plan against Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>They were close in on the island now. Bill Naylor could see the individual
  trees come out from the mist of darkness and take shape. There was a little
  point that had been burned over, and the shapes of the trees were skeletons
  of horrible grotesqueness. Presently the log began to veer off into the
  deeper and stronger current.</p>

  <p>"Now!" called Naylor, and he dived away from the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>He swam strongly, and rejoiced to see that it was easy to make progress
  across the stream. Looking behind him, he saw Gregor hesitate, then follow
  with a floundering splash.</p>

  <p>"The clumsy fool!" thought Naylor.</p>

  <p>Suppose that sharp eyes watched them from the other bank and made out the
  glimmering of that splash?</p>

  <p>But as Naylor gained footing and waded through the softness of the mud
  through the shallows, and felt again the full weight of his body as he got to
  turf underfoot, big Duff Gregor came striding up beside him, and the sense of
  superiority which had been Naylor's vanished at once.</p>

  <p>They went on through the trees. The water in their boots made squelching
  sounds. The forest thickened over them just as the rain commenced. It started
  with volleyings and crashings the way a heavy downpour in the mountains will
  often set out. Every time they got out from under the foliage of the
  evergreens, the strength of the rain whipped and stung their faces with the
  strength of bullets.</p>

  <p>Gregor paused suddenly.</p>

  <p>"This is hell," he said.</p>

  <p>"Bullets are worse hell," said Naylor. "Or maybe you'd rather have a nice
  warm jail?"</p>

  <p>Gregor walked on again, and Bill Naylor disliked him more and more. They
  came into a natural clearing in what must have been just about the center of
  the river island. Gregor paused.</p>

  <p>"We'll have a fire here," he said, "as long as we have to wait for
  Christian."</p>

  <p>"No fire," directed Bill Naylor. "What's the good of showing people the
  way to us with a light? What's the good of holding up a light for them to see
  by?"</p>

  <p>"You do as you please," said Gregor. "I'm going to have a fire. No good
  being saved from jail today to die of pneumonia to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You're all softened up. Or were you ever hard?" asked Naylor.</p>

  <p>Gregor turned on him with a savagery of gesture and voice that lighted him
  up, so to speak.</p>

  <p>"I've had your tongue before," said Gregor. "I won't have no more of it.
  Shut up and keep shut up!"</p>

  <p>Naylor drew back&mdash;to the proper distance for a full-arm smash. He had
  a long, whipping, overhand punch that did a lot of damage except to men who
  were expert boxers. He didn't think that Gregor was much of a boxer, and felt
  that he might trust that overhand wallop. But Gregor did not press his point.
  He seemed to think that that shrinking back had meant a good deal. Therefore
  he turned abruptly away and could be heard tearing up brush. He had found
  some dead brush; it snapped and crackled under his grasp. A whole herd of
  horses could hardly have made so much noise.</p>

  <p>Where a big tree offered almost perfect shelter from the rain, Gregor
  built up his small heap of brush for the fire. Soon his voice growled:</p>

  <p>"Every match wet. Got any matches, partner?"</p>

  <p>"Not to light a fire," answered Naylor.</p>

  <p>He was taking off his clothes, preparatory to wringing them as dry as
  possible. Wet clothes are all right, so long as they're not slopping wet.
  Clothes only so wet that the heat of the body can dry them out are all right.
  That is, unless you have to sit still in a wind.</p>

  <p>"You got a match. Lemme have a match, will you, brother?" pleaded
  Gregor.</p>

  <p>"You big bum," said Naylor. "What kind of a man are you? Jail has gone and
  softened you all up. Well, here's a match for you. It's on your own hook. I'm
  not guilty."</p>

  <p>"Sure, it's on my own hook," said Gregor. "Nothing but a frog would come
  to this island on a night like this. We're as safe as if we were on the other
  side of the mountains."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and that's what you say."</p>

  <p>But, finding the oiled silk that carefully wrapped his matches, Naylor
  handed over the small package. He felt a sulky discontent in surrendering his
  matches, but when the flame leaped up, yellow-red and cracking, and the first
  smoke cleared away from the blaze and rolled in low clouds under the wide
  branches of the tree, he began to change his mind. He finished wringing out
  his clothes and sat on a stump near the fire in order to empty his boots.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and it ain't so bad, eh?" said Gregor. "Another thing, if Barry
  Christian's to meet us on the island here, he'll have to have something to
  guide him, won't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah? Well, all right," said Naylor. "The only thing is, I've always gone
  on the idea that there's nothing safer than playing safe."</p>

  <p>"Aw, we're all right," insisted Gregor. "I'll take the responsibility.
  It'll be all on me."</p>

  <p>"You won't take the bullets, though. They won't ask you which way they
  ought to travel."</p>

  <p>"Who'll shoot at you?" cried Gregor suddenly. "Who'll even think of you?
  It's me they're after."</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor lowered his head and looked from under the darkness of his
  brows at his companion. It was a big figure of a man that he saw, with really
  magnificent shoulders, and the head well-placed on them. The face was
  handsome, too. There had not been enough jail to fade all the sun-brown off
  the skin.</p>

  <p>More than once Naylor had seen pictures of Jim Silver, and he could
  understand how it might be that people would mistake this man for the famous
  fighter. There were even the two spots of gray over the temples, like
  incipient horns. They gave a sinister touch to the figure of the big fellow.
  He was stripping off his clothes now, and his body was big with muscle. But
  it was not quite the effect that one would expect to get from seeing the real
  Jim Silver stripped. There was not the same easy and stringy flow of muscles
  that gave speed to the bulk when it was in action. It seemed to Naylor that
  there was a touch of weakness about the mouth of this man, also.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Naylor. "It's you that they're after, all right. I know
  that."</p>

  <p>He got out his tobacco pouch, so well wrapped and waterproofed that not a
  drop had touched the contents. He loaded his short pipe, whose stem had been
  worried off to little more than a half of its original length, with a new
  hold for the teeth whittled into the hard rubber. He began to smoke, sucking
  hard at the tobacco until the flame was well spread and the coal tamped
  down.</p>

  <p>"Got any papers?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Can't I have a smoke, then? Lemme have a whiff, will you, partner?"</p>

  <p>There was a slight whine in the voice. The lips of Naylor twitched.</p>

  <p>He removed the pipe from his mouth. He prided himself on a certain number
  of delicacies. Now he took out a clean handkerchief. It was soaked with the
  river water, of course, but that didn't matter. He used it to cleanse the
  mouthpiece of the pipe, and then handed it over, stem first.</p>

  <p>Gregor grabbed it with a greedy hand and began to draw down great whiffs
  of the smoke. He started talking, his enunciation biting the exhalation of
  smoke to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Rotten strong stuff you smoke," he said. "Rotten cheap stuff!"</p>

  <p>Naylor said nothing. He registered the bad taste of this remark and said
  nothing whatever. Things like this helped him to place his companion. There
  was no use arguing about such a point. Except on a Monday morning, when one
  wants to get warmed up for a long, hard week.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, it's strong," he drawled finally.</p>

  <p>He watched Gregor consuming the pipe load rapidly. After a long time
  Gregor asked:</p>

  <p>"What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Naylor."</p>

  <p>"Which Naylor?"</p>

  <p>"Bill Naylor."</p>

  <p>Gregor chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You don't like it, eh?"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Gregor.</p>

  <p>Naylor looked slowly away. The jump of the firelight gave him view of long
  vistas among the brown tree trunks. Shapes seemed to move with the toss and
  the swing of the fire.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," he said as a bit of water was shaken from a bough above and
  went down his neck. "I dunno. Maybe it's not all right."</p>

  <p>"Don't get the bulldog up, Shorty," cautioned Gregor, lifting a
  threatening finger.</p>

  <p>Then a deep, soft voice, close to them said.</p>

  <p>"Hands up, please! Stick them right up, boys."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; JIM SILVER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE mind of Bill Naylor slashed through several reflections
  and one great regret as he heard that voice. He looked straight at Duff
  Gregor and saw the shock strike the big fellow like a bullet. It paralyzed
  Gregor. It froze him in mid-gesture, so to speak.</p>

  <p>"Right up, friends," said the soft, deep voice.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Naylor like the sort of a voice that one would expect from
  the spirit of the island, half obscured and dark. There was music in it that
  went with the sound of the storm. And then the wind, following after,
  screeched suddenly through the near-by treetops.</p>

  <p>Gregor groaned.</p>

  <p>Naylor shoved up his hands slowly. Firelight is not good light to shoot
  by. If he took a dive backward, rolling on the ground, he could get himself
  into a tangle of brush, and from that behind the trees, and it would take
  very snappy and straight shooting to get him. Not every man can do much with
  a revolver in the daylight. Not one in a thousand is any good at night.</p>

  <p>"If one of you makes a quick start, I'll have to nail him," said the voice
  of the unseen man. "I mean you, Shorty, if that's your name! Gregor, get the
  hands right up over your head and try to grab that branch of the tree."</p>

  <p>Gregor was obedient. Bill Naylor decided that this was not the time to
  take chances&mdash;not just now. For there was no hysterical yell in the
  throat of the unknown man. There was no strain of excitement. There was
  simply the businesslike intonation of one who is in a familiar situation.</p>

  <p>Then, as Naylor got his hands high, straight toward him out of the shadows
  stepped a big man whose wet slicker glistened like polished steel. He had a
  gun in either hand, and he held those guns low, about the level of his
  stomach. He held them with the careless mastery of one who knows his tools.
  He looked like a brother of big Duff Gregor, an older and a better-made
  brother. There was more in the shoulders and less in the hips. There was more
  in the flesh, and more under the flesh, so to speak.</p>

  <p>And all at once Naylor cried out as realization struck him sick: "Jim
  Silver!"</p>

  <p>Gregor seemed to feel the words in the pit of the stomach. He gasped, as
  he bent forward with a jerk: "Silver? Jim Silver?" And he twisted his head
  and stood there agape. "It's Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was in the books for me to meet you one day," said Silver.
  "Straighten up and keep those hands high, Gregor."</p>

  <p>A faint, moaning sound came from the lips of Gregor, and Naylor thought it
  was like the whining of a young puppy exposed to weather such as this.</p>

  <p>"Both of you face away from me," said Silver. "Then you can put your hands
  down and shell out your guns. Move your hands slowly. I hope nobody's going
  to be hurt."</p>

  <p>There was a quiet irony about this. Naylor made no mistakes. He
  deliberately, slowly, faced around, and then pulled out his pair of guns and
  dropped them one by one to the ground. Gregor had a gun, too, and got rid of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Is that all boys?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>And Gregor added: "Every scrap of everything."</p>

  <p>"Get back close to the fire," said Silver. "You're cold. Start in
  dressing. I don't have to tell you that I'm watching all the time for queer
  moves."</p>

  <p>Naylor obeyed and began to dress. He was cold, and shuddering a little. He
  could see that Gregor was so frightened that he was almost incapable of
  getting the well-wrung clothes back on his body.</p>

  <p>When Naylor was dressed, he said: "Well, Silver? What happens next?"</p>

  <p>He was surprised to hear Silver say: "I don't know. Just what do you
  suggest? What's your name, again?"</p>

  <p>"Naylor. Bill Naylor."</p>

  <p>"I think I've heard that name. What do you do?"</p>

  <p>Naylor canted his head a little. It never had been very hard to face the
  lawmen, no matter what they knew about his record. It was not so good to tell
  things to this man, somehow. It made him feel a little homesick, uneasy in
  the spirit.</p>

  <p>"I live on my face," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"You think over what you've heard about me, and you'll understand."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you live by your wits?"</p>

  <p>"What there are of them," admitted Naylor.</p>

  <p>Something happened to the gun that was occupied in covering him. It got a
  little steadier; it came to life; it took on a certain eager sentience.</p>

  <p>"What's your record?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Oh, anything you like. I've run chinks over the border and I've been a
  stick-up artist. A lot of things in between. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well," murmured Silver. "Well, I don't know. And on the road you and
  Gregor became friends?"</p>

  <p>Naylor grunted.</p>

  <p>Silver maintained a long silence. He sighed, at last, and said:</p>

  <p>"I thought that Gregor was a rat. I was wrong. No man that has a friend
  like you, Naylor, is a rat."</p>

  <p>Naylor waited for the new qualification. There might be things lower than
  and worse than rats. But Silver was not supposed to be a fellow who scattered
  insults. There was something in the air that was strange.</p>

  <p>"I've been in the jail in Crow's Nest," said Silver. "I know what it means
  to get out of it. Taxi got me out one night. It was a hard job. And if you've
  taken out Duff Gregor, you have brains and nerve, Naylor. That's all."</p>

  <p>Naylor saw how the wind was blowing, but he could not believe his eyes and
  his ears. Big Duff Gregor had finished dressing. He stood straight and stiff
  by the fire, holding out his hands to the blaze rather as if he wanted to
  make a shadow for his face than to get warmth into his blood.</p>

  <p>"Silver," he began, "what I want to say is that that other
  deal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" said Silver. "Don't say it. I'd rather not talk with you, Gregor.
  I'd rather not hear from you."</p>

  <p>Gregor's teeth clicked together in the ecstasy of his fear. He spoke not a
  word more. And a strange shame suffused the very soul of Naylor as he saw
  that Silver felt that this jail break had been managed by him, by Bill
  Naylor, simply because of the friendship that he bore for the big man.</p>

  <p>Silver said: "I've wanted to know that Gregor was in jail, safely behind
  the bars. Perhaps another day I'll be trying to put him where I've always
  thought that he belongs. But there's nothing in the world as great as
  friendship. You've done a big thing, Naylor. You've done such a big thing
  that I'm not going to spoil it for you. Not to-night."</p>

  <p>Gradually Bill Naylor understood. He could not take in the whole thing at
  once. He had to feel his way through the idea little by little. Friendship is
  a sacred thing. According to the understanding of Silver, Naylor had done the
  greatest thing that can be done; he had offered his life for that of another;
  he had done it through sheer affection.</p>

  <p>What would Silver feel if he knew that the money of Barry Christian had
  organized this whole deal?</p>

  <p>Other things went through the mind of Bill Naylor. He could see that we
  judge others by what is inside us. That was how Jim Silver was judging
  Naylor&mdash;by what Silver would have been capable of in the same
  circumstances. He was judging Naylor, too, by what "Taxi" had done for him on
  that other, that famous night when Taxi took his friend out of the Crow's
  Nest jail, through the lynching mob.</p>

  <p>Something swelled in the throat of Naylor and tried to speak. He had to
  choke it down. It was a crazy impulse to confess the truth. It was an insane
  feeling that he could not bear to be misunderstood, even for the better, by
  this man Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>But there was Duff Gregor, standing straight and stiff, as though his
  backbone were a rod of ice. One word of the truth about affairs would ruin
  Gregor. One word connecting his jail break with Barry Christian would be the
  destruction of Gregor.</p>

  <p>On what a mine of danger Silver himself was standing, thought Naylor, with
  his greatest enemy restored to the world from death! Ignorance blindfolded
  Jim Silver. Perhaps that ignorance which he could not help would permit
  Christian to steal up and deliver the fatal blow.</p>

  <p>Such a rage of contrasting emotions as troubled Naylor at this moment
  never had disturbed him before.</p>

  <p>Then he heard men from the distant calling, answering one another faintly.
  Big Gregor heard the sounds, too, and started violently.</p>

  <p>"It's my duty," said Silver, "to hold you both here until the men from
  Crow's Nest come up and get the pair of you. Well, I'm not going to be true
  to my duty. They're going to go over this little island with a fine-tooth
  comb. There's no way you can get through them. I saw them scattering out to
  encircle the place. There must be fifty of them. But&mdash;well, suppose you
  drop into this bit of brush right here by the fire. I'll throw my slicker
  over the brush to keep it in shadow. I'll freshen the fire to make the flames
  dazzle 'em a little. Here, take these guns. We don't want 'em in the
  way."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE POSSE</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL NAYLOR found himself crouched in the brush with the
  shadow of the slicker covering him. When he stooped his head lower, he could
  look out beneath the skirt of the big rubberized garment and see the firelit
  scene.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver had said only one thing in conclusion: "You've got your guns.
  Don't use them. You've only got them in trust while I try to handle this
  crowd."</p>

  <p>And the voice of Gregor had whispered in savage answer: "Yeah, the first
  shot I'd take would be at you, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The whispered curses were things that Naylor could not believe. There is
  such a thing as gratitude in this world. There has to be. Otherwise
  everything falls to pieces; there is nothing that a man can catch hold of.
  Substance turns to air unless there is gratitude.</p>

  <p>For instance, Barry Christian must feel gratitude for what had been done
  for him by Naylor. He must recollect that Naylor had picked him out of death
  in the river; he must remember that the fortune in his hands at the present
  moment had been placed there by Naylor at the cost of hair-raising peril
  endured. And again, it was for the sake of Barry Christian, not of Barry's
  money, that Bill Naylor had met the jailbird Gregor and endured the peril of
  the river chase.</p>

  <p>Those were the things that kept hunting through the mind of Naylor as he
  crouched in the brush while the new fuel was heaped on the fire by Jim Silver
  and the flames rushed upward, throwing shuddering waves of light through the
  green-and-brown obscurity of the trees. That is what the human soul is
  like&mdash;a dark, entangled jungle except where human faith and trust and
  affection illumine it. But such light could never penetrate the mind of Duff
  Gregor, Naylor felt.</p>

  <p>Gregor was ready at this moment, at the first touch of danger, to crash a
  bullet through the heart of the man who had just spared him. And how great
  was the weight of the past to keep Silver from sparing Gregor. Next to Barry
  Christian, who was there in the world that Silver had so many reasons for
  hating?</p>

  <p>It was a frightful turmoil that these things made in the mind of Naylor as
  he reflected upon them. He had the vast picture of Barry Christian in his
  mind's eye, a huge brain, a mighty power, endless in resource and craft. That
  man was his friend. He had bought the friendship of Barry Christian by such
  acts as he never had performed for any other human being in all of his days.
  But Barry Christian was a force all for evil. And here was another man
  greater than Christian, more powerful in brain and in body, but weakened only
  because he could not help having faith and trust in the goodness of his
  fellow man. And all the force and the weight of Silver was on the side of
  good.</p>

  <p>Well, it was not strange, thought Naylor, that there were people ready to
  die for Jim Silver!</p>

  <p>For his own part&mdash;well, Naylor was a crook by taste, by life, and by
  training. Therefore he would cling to Barry Christian. But&mdash;</p>

  <p>He had reached that point in his reflections when the noise of the men of
  Crow's Nest came close to the place. They came stamping through the brush.
  The waves of their lantern light fought with the softer, wider waves of the
  firelight. They were scanning the trees and hunting every hole as they closed
  in. Then, with a sudden rush, they were through the trees, on one side of the
  clearing.</p>

  <p>"We've got him!" yelled voices. "Hey! We've got Gregor! Up with your
  hands, Gregor! Up with 'em!"</p>

  <p>Gregor shuddered violently. Naylor looked out and saw the men swarming
  toward Jim Silver, who stood with his hands raised, very calm, saying:</p>

  <p>"All right, boys!"</p>

  <p>That reminded Naylor of what he had heard&mdash;that Silver was helpless
  against other honest men. That was why he had almost been pulled down by the
  Crow's Nest mob once before.</p>

  <p>They went in at Jim Silver with a savage eagerness, till one of them
  shouted:</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute! It's not Gregor! It's the real Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>"You fool," said another, "Silver's gone away. This is Gregor. It's gotta
  be Gregor!"</p>

  <p>"It ain't Gregor. It's Jim Silver. Look at the scars on his face."</p>

  <p>"Gregor made up once before with them same scars."</p>

  <p>"He ain't had time to make up with 'em. Besides, it ain't the same face.
  It's Silver. Jim, I'm sorry we rushed you."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>"If it's Silver, where's Parade?" asked another voice.</p>

  <p>Silver whistled. And out of the darkness beyond the fire, in the direction
  from which the rest of the men of Crow's Nest were hurrying toward the
  shouting, sounded a loud neighing. Brush crackled, and Naylor, his face close
  to the ground, peering out beneath the flap of the slicker, saw a great
  golden chestnut stallion leap into the circle of the firelight and rush for
  his master. Other men were in the way. They scattered with a yell of fear
  from the striking hoofs of the big horse. And now Parade stood at the side of
  Jim Silver, snorting, tossing his head, defying danger like one who had long
  been intimate with it.</p>

  <p>Horses had always been to Naylor mere means of locomotion. Suddenly he saw
  that a horse could be to a man like a throne to a king.</p>

  <p>Newcomers of the Crow's Nest men, wet and panting with their laboring
  through the marshes, scratched and stung by breaking through the dense brush
  of the island, now came blundering into view with excited faces.</p>

  <p>Gradually they realized that it was not the man they had hunted for.</p>

  <p>Sheriff Dick Williams suddenly appeared, soaked, bedraggled, looking like
  a man who had risen newly from a sick bed. He went up to Silver and held out
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Are we shaking, Jim?" he asked. "Or do you keep hard feelings about the
  way Crow's Nest treated you in the old days?"</p>

  <p>Silver took the hand willingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not such a fool," he said, and then took his stand right by the coat
  which covered the two fugitives. It was not the slicker; it was the great
  name and reputation of Silver that sheltered the pair, Naylor felt.</p>

  <p>"Gregor got away," said the sheriff. "I won't have the reputation of a
  yellow dog in the county. You and Taxi open the jail like an old tin can; and
  now Gregor gets hold of keys somehow and simply unlocks three doors and walks
  out while I'm forward in my office. Gregor, and there was another gent with
  him&mdash;the gent that had horses waiting. It's bad business for me,
  Jim!"</p>

  <p>Silver nodded. Naylor, staring cautiously up into the face of the sheriff,
  wondered at the man. A few days ago he had been as straight and as honest as
  any man in the mountains. For his straightness and his courage he had been
  proverbial. Well, he was a bought man now&mdash;and he looked ten years
  older. He was bought, and Barry Christian's money had turned the trick.</p>

  <p>"Every man has a price," Christian had said&mdash;every man except Jim
  Silver. But that was not true, either. Silver had been bought and paid for on
  this night. A mistaken kindness and sentiment had undone his good intentions
  and made him harbor a pair of rascals.</p>

  <p>The men of Crow's Nest seemed to forget about the man hunt that they had
  been engaged in.</p>

  <p>A big fellow said: "Hey, Jim Silver; dog-gone me but it does me good to
  see you ag'in."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Harry," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"But Gregor and the other are gone. We sure seen 'em get onto the island,
  all right. Seen anything of 'em, Jim?"</p>

  <p>Silver said nothing. Another man cried, on the heel of the words of
  Harry:</p>

  <p>"If he'd seen 'em, wouldn't he 'a' grabbed 'em? If he'd seen Gregor
  living, we'd be looking at Gregor dead right now. Ain't you got any sense,
  Harry?"</p>

  <p>"We'll have to scatter out, boys," said the sheriff. "We'll have to get
  across on the far side of the island. The current's a lot shallower and
  weaker there. We can manage it, all right."</p>

  <p>"I'm wet enough for one night," said Harry, leading one half of the
  sentiment with his loud voice. "Hey, Jim, what's brought you back again to
  Crow's Nest?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not in Crow's Nest, Harry," said Silver in his deep and quiet
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Aye, but ain't you on your way? Tell us, Silver&mdash;you aint' on your
  way to a wedding, are you?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer from Silver. One of the other men said:</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Harry. Don't be such a loud mouth!"</p>

  <p>Others grinned. Their grins were brief. It seemed that the respect in
  which they held Silver would not permit them to do otherwise than stare at
  the man with a consuming awe.</p>

  <p>They began to divide into two parties. Half were returning to Crow's Nest.
  Others would push on behind the sheriff, who was reminding them that the two
  fugitives were not mounted. If there were any luck, the pair would be picked
  up before the night ended. At any rate, there was no use in wasting time on
  this spot, since the island already had been searched.</p>

  <p>"Are you coming on with us, Jim?" asked one.</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here&mdash;for a while," said Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>Then the two parties separated, a few not too cheerful insults being
  hurled by the resolute followers of the sheriff after the heads of the weaker
  members who were returning home to warm beds.</p>

  <p>The sheriff shook hands with Silver in farewell.</p>

  <p>He said in a quiet voice: "Remember, Jim, we want you in Crow's Nest.
  We're not the only town that wants you, but no other town owes you so much.
  There's no other crowd that you can count on so much, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Silver. "You look sick, sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Do I?" said the sheriff in a startled voice.</p>

  <p>"You look as though you'd gotten up from a sick bed."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," said the sheriff. "Right as a trivet."</p>

  <p>"And the boy?" said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Why," murmured the sheriff, "he ain't so good."</p>

  <p>"I heard that he needed a change of air," said Silver. "I got word about
  it, and, as a matter of fact, Williams, I remembered that I have a good bit
  of cash that's not working, and I wondered if you'd let me help you out with
  the boy."</p>

  <p>"You?" said the sheriff in a groaning voice. "You help me out, Jim?"</p>

  <p>And he turned suddenly and fled as if wild wolves were after him. But
  Naylor understood. If the sheriff had waited one more day, he would have had
  honest money instead of a bribe to use.</p>

  <p>Perhaps on that night, thought Naylor, the great event was not the freeing
  of Gregor or the great-hearted kindness of Jim Silver; it was the personal
  tragedy of the sheriff who had sold himself at the very moment when honest
  help was coming toward him.</p>

  <p>It was a very queer thing. The queerest of all was that Naylor did not
  feel like laughing about it!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; SURPRISED</h2>

  <p class="first">AS THE men of Crow's Nest scattered, Silver began to pace up
  and down beside the fire, careless of whether or not the rain came rattling
  down on his head and shoulders. After a time, when not a voice could be heard
  out of the distance, he said:</p>

  <p>"Come out, boys."</p>

  <p>They came out into the firelight.</p>

  <p>"You made a flock of fools of 'em," cried Duff Gregor. "That was the
  slickest that I ever seen, Jim! That was a beauty! Kind of too bad that they
  ain't ever goin' to know what a lot of fools you made of 'em!"</p>

  <p>Silver looked straight and hard at him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they will know, one day," said Silver. "Perhaps they'll know when
  you're caught up again, Gregor."</p>

  <p>"Me? The gang that ever catches me is goin' to have nothing but dead meat
  to handle, lemme tell you!" answered Duff Gregor, striking one hand into the
  palm of the other.</p>

  <p>Silver looked steadily at him and said nothing. Bill Naylor, a little
  shamed by this desperate boast of Gregor, bit his lip and stared at the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"It was the best job," said Gregor, "that I ever seen, and it saved my
  hide. Here's my hand, Silver."</p>

  <p>Silver looked down at the proffered hand and shook his head. Gradually the
  smile of Gregor froze, and his hand fell away. It seemed to Naylor one of the
  most terrible things that he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Silver said, more gently than ever: "We'd better not shake hands, Gregor.
  There are too many things that we don't know about one another. Maybe I'm
  doing the worst thing of my life in letting you go. But Bill Naylor has done
  a job that I wouldn't want to spoil."</p>

  <p>The shudder caused by that speech was still working up and down the spine
  of Bill Naylor long after they were off the island, long after they had
  forded the narrower arm of the Kendal River and had floundered such miles
  through wind and mud that their clothes were beginning to grow dry on their
  tired bodies. He felt that he would far rather have had heavy leaden slugs
  tearing through his body than to have listened to the speech of Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>But all that Duff Gregor did about it at the time was to fall silent. And
  all that he did about it now was to curse Jim Silver and all of his kind.</p>

  <p>Naylor stopped him suddenly by halting in a lull of the storm and
  saying:</p>

  <p>"Well, except for the way Jim Silver acted, the pair of us would be on the
  way back to jail&mdash;or dead&mdash;by now."</p>

  <p>Gregor had to consider this remark for a time before he ventured: "Look
  here, Bill. You beginning to think that Silver's the right kind of a
  gent?"</p>

  <p>Naylor could not answer this. For if Silver was "the right kind of a
  gent," then the entire life of Naylor was thrown away. No, Silver could not
  be "the right kind of a gent." It was Barry Christian who must serve as the
  ideal.</p>

  <p>They followed the course which Christian had prescribed for them if they
  did not meet on the island. He had told Bill Naylor to keep on a certain
  trail until he reached the remains of an old ranch. The ranch house itself
  was gone to ruin, and the sheds were sinking in corruption; but there
  remained the huge barn that had once housed hundreds of tons of wild hay
  against the winter season of scarcity. It was far into the night when at last
  those weary travelers saw the roof and the shoulders of the barn break across
  the smoothly running lines of the hills. Big Duff Gregor had been cursing the
  journey long before they reached this goal.</p>

  <p>As the barn arose, huge and black, close to them, Bill Naylor whistled the
  signal which had been agreed upon. A moment later the whistle of Barry
  Christian gave answer, and Naylor could have groaned with relief.</p>

  <p>As they came up they saw the vague outlines of Christian standing beside
  the big sliding door that closed one end of the barn. His voice gave them
  greeting:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Gregor. Well done, Bill!"</p>

  <p>He shook hands with Gregor, who exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"They gave us hell! We needed faster horses than that pair."</p>

  <p>"You should have pulled out without being seen," answered Christian.</p>

  <p>"It was bad luck that gave 'em a glimpse of me," said Gregor, "and after
  that the whole town came on the run after us. They came like so many
  devils."</p>

  <p>"They thought they were running after two devils," said Christian. "You
  two are fagged. Well, we can spend the rest of the night here&mdash;until the
  gray of the morning. By that time we ought to get away into the hills. Come
  in here and you can turn in."</p>

  <p>He showed the way into the barn. There were still heaps of the old hay on
  the floor, and behind a partition in a corner of the big building, Gregor and
  Naylor simply burrowed into the hay and prepared to close their eyes.</p>

  <p>Christian sat down on his heels near by and talked to them for a moment.
  He had his horse hobbled out at a little distance from the barn, he said. One
  of them could ride it when they started the march in the morning; for his
  part, he would be glad enough to stretch his legs, walking. They would not
  have to go far into the hills before they would come to places where they
  could buy good horses. Because this was a district where the old days of
  Barry Christian were remembered, and where men would be glad to see them
  return&mdash;days when big amounts of ready cash could be secured in reward
  for very small acts of service done to the great outlaw or to his men.</p>

  <p>"I showed myself to one man," said Christian. "He thought I was a ghost
  come to haunt him, at first; but afterward he seemed to be glad that I was
  around. We are going to start something in this same neck of the woods. I'm
  going to line the pockets of you fellows with gold!"</p>

  <p>Gregor groaned with relief and comfort as the hay pressed close to him the
  warmth of his own body.</p>

  <p>"We been through a lot to-night," he said. "We'll talk about the next job
  in the morning. You know what we've been through? We've been through Jim
  Silver."</p>

  <p>The silence of Barry Christian was a throbbing thing that Naylor felt
  through the darkness. Then his voice, strangely flat, said:</p>

  <p>"Silver again?"</p>

  <p>"Silver again," said Gregor, and told the story in some detail. He ended
  by cursing Silver for not being willing to shake hands. But Christian began
  to laugh. There was a snarl in his laughter.</p>

  <p>"That's his weak side. That's where he's a fool," said Christian. "One of
  these days I'll work on that weak side of his and get him down. I begin to
  know how to handle him. Make an appeal of a certain sort to him and he can't
  resist it. Here's Bill Naylor, half his life in prison, and on the way to
  join me; but Jim Silver lets the pair of you go because he takes it for
  granted that Bill has been a hero and helped you out because he's your best
  friend. The poor fool! He doesn't realize that my money walked Bill out of
  the town. Why, it makes me laugh!</p>

  <p>"And Silver hears that the honest sheriff has a sick child, and he comes
  all the way back to Crow's Nest to lend him money, eh? Well, the honest
  sheriff has money of a different sort, right now&mdash;and he's going to
  repay it with his blood. I'm not through bleeding him. But what pleases me is
  the fact that Jim Silver can be bamboozled like this. That's why I laugh. And
  that's why I'm going to have him down one of these days. No fool can stand up
  against me and keep on winning!"</p>

  <p>There was truth in that remark, and Bill Naylor felt it. No mere fool
  could stand up against Barry Christian. Not even if he had all the skill,
  strength, and courage in the world. He could not succeed against Christian so
  long as he showed a really weak side, and that was what Silver was
  indicating. He was too corrupted by belief in the natural goodness of human
  nature. He could trust, actually, to a rogue like Bill Naylor, jailbird.</p>

  <p>And yet perhaps there was something in the heart of Bill Naylor that had
  been touched more deeply than he himself knew. He closed his eyes and found
  himself picturing again the scene by the camp fire among the trees, and the
  formidable shape of Silver, glistening in the wet slicker. He could remember
  every tone of the man's voice. He could remember what Silver had said about
  friendship as the most sacred thing in the world.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was.</p>

  <p>Naylor, opening his eyes suddenly, stared up at the blank and whirling
  darkness. Suppose, he thought, that the friendship of such a man as Jim
  Silver should come to him? What would he, Naylor, be willing to do for the
  sake of it when he had been willing to do so much even to be esteemed a man
  by Barry Christian, who always sneered at such ideas as those of
  friendship?</p>

  <p>According to Christian, the mainspring of our actions is the desire for
  profit, and he had built up his formidable gangs in the trust that he,
  Christian, was more profitable to them than any other man could be. But still
  there was something working in the heart of Naylor.</p>

  <p>Then, with a great, screeching voice, the sliding door at the end of the
  barn was thrust open. Men entered, and wide waves of lantern light washed
  through the blackness of the interior!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; A BIG DEAL</h2>

  <p class="first">THE characteristics of the three appeared in that instant in
  good part. Duff Gregor came to his feet with a hissing outgo of his
  frightened breath. Naylor got to one knee, with a gun ready in his hand. And
  Barry Christian said, not even using a whisper, so perfectly was he aware of
  the way sound would travel:</p>

  <p>"They're not looking for us. There are only three. And they're holding
  lights for us to shoot by, if we want to take them in hand. Steady, boys. By
  thunder, I think I know two of 'em. I do know two of 'em!"</p>

  <p>He had out a pair of guns. The glimmer of them in those famous hands made
  Naylor feel that the lives of the three strangers could be wiped away with a
  mere gesture.</p>

  <p>The three were composed of a tall man in the prime of life, with very
  nervous movements of head and hand; a big, bulky fellow with so much stomach
  that it was certain that he would be uncomfortable on horseback, and another
  fellow of average size. He and the tall fellow carried lanterns. One of these
  was hung up against the wall of the barn. The fat man sat down on the hay
  cross-legged and made a cigarette. All three of those tossed aside wet
  slickers.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian was saying in a whisper to his companions: "The fat man,
  Pudge Wayler. The tall man, Pokey. The other's new; the first two used to
  work for me. This is something worth while."</p>

  <p>It was in fact something worth while, as almost the first words of the
  conversation revealed.</p>

  <p>For "Pudge" Wayler was saying: "All right, Mr. Rooney. This ought to be a
  safe enough place even for an express clerk to talk in."</p>

  <p>Rooney walked in an irregular circle toward the fading borders of the
  lantern light. Then he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"It's a rotten hard business for me, Wayler. You fellows have the law on
  your backs, anyway, but I have forty years of going straight behind me. Let
  me tell you this right now. If I go through with the deal, you'll have to pay
  me for the forty years."</p>

  <p>"Sure, sure," said the fat man. He took off his sombrero and ran his hand
  over his fat, shining bald head and his face. "Don't worry about that, old
  son. You'll get your split."</p>

  <p>"How big a split do you make it?" asked Rooney.</p>

  <p>"That depends on how big the job is," said Wayler.</p>

  <p>"How big?" demanded Rooney. "Are you fellows such green hands that you
  have to be told what it means to stop an overland express train and get at
  the money safe with two express guards on hand to protect it?"</p>

  <p>"Listen," said "Pokey," making a nervous gesture with both hands. "Didn't
  I tell you that we used to work for Barry Christian? Does that mean that
  we're dumb? We mean&mdash;how much is going to be in the safe?"</p>

  <p>"Three hundred and fifty thousand, if there's a penny."</p>

  <p>Pokey did not exclaim. He merely turned and looked down at Wayler with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>Pudge Wayler said: "Well, that's a neat little haul. What slice do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"One third," said Rooney.</p>

  <p>"Hello, hello!" said Wayler.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," urged Pokey with polite sarcasm. "You don't understand
  what he means, Pudge. He means that he tips off the lay to us, and then you
  and me hold up the train, kill the guards, blow the safe, and get out the
  haul. That's all we have to do, and that makes it a three-cornered
  split."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fool!" said Rooney. "I know that you'll have to have half a
  dozen good men in on the deal with you."</p>

  <p>"And still you want a whole third for yourself?" asked Pudge Wayler.</p>

  <p>"I want a whole third," said Rooney. "I'm the one who spots the train that
  takes the shipment. Otherwise you fellows would never be able to put your
  hand on the right train. You'd have your trouble for almost nothing. I get a
  third or I don't go through."</p>

  <p>Wayler and Pokey consulted one another with silent eyes. They said
  nothing, and Rooney went on:</p>

  <p>"Another thing. This has to be a right job. You can't just grab the safe
  and then run for it. I want the whole list of passengers searched the way a
  regular train robbery would be run off. Otherwise it'll be too plain that
  somebody has tipped you off about the cash shipment."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said Pudge Wayler. "That's sense. But it's a tricky job,
  sometimes, handling a long list of passengers. It takes time, and some of
  those hombres may have guns and know how to use 'em."</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying that it's easy," Rooney assured him. "I'm just telling you
  what has to be done if you fellows are going to work with me."</p>

  <p>"The boy is hungry, and he knows just what he wants to eat," answered
  Pokey satirically.</p>

  <p>"I've told you the facts. You can wrangle them to suit yourselves," said
  Rooney. "Tell me short and straight: Do you play the game my way, or not at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Rooney," said Pudge Wayler. "You got the wrong idea. I can
  see what's put you off. You've had the idea that train robbers are kind of
  benevolent brotherhoods. You got an idea that fellows that rob trains are
  just doing it for the sake of getting a little fun. And then they give away
  the hard cash to the gents with the great brains that sit in offices in town
  and polish mahogany desks with their heels. Is that the picture you're
  drawin' of us?"</p>

  <p>Rooney had the grace to laugh. The other two laughed, also, but very
  shortly.</p>

  <p>"All right, boys," said Rooney. "I know what you mean. But you're the
  fishermen with the rods and lines, and I'm the fellow who hooks the fish on
  under the water. That's why I get the big split. There are not five men in
  the outfit that could tell you the train that shipment goes on."</p>

  <p>Wayler nodded. "There's not five men," he said, "that can tell you how
  straight those guards on the train are going to be able to shoot. And I don't
  have to stand twice to make a shadow."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Rooney. "That's another thing that I've got on my mind. I'm
  sending those two poor devils to their death. I'm doing about the rottenest
  trick that any human being can do. And I'm going to be paid for it or I won't
  go through."</p>

  <p>Pokey barked out, his voice suddenly high and shrill: "You go to the
  devil, then! I got a mind to bash in your face for you!"</p>

  <p>Rooney made a quick, jerking step to the rear, and a little bulldog
  revolver appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"All right, boys," he said. "If that's the way you feel about it, it's
  just too bad. And the deal quits right here. I'll say so long to you and go
  home."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Pudge Wayler, who had a big Colt lying out on his
  knee the instant that Rooney made a move. "I don't know about all of this.
  You got some information that we want. I dunno that you're so sure of leaving
  before we have that news out of you."</p>

  <p>"No," yelled Pokey. "You can name that train, and you're goin' to do
  it!"</p>

  <p>He, also, had a gun in his hand, and slipped off to the side so as to take
  Rooney between two fires.</p>

  <p>The express-company man seemed perfectly at home in the situation. He was
  at least not the sort to be bluffed. He said: "Back up, Pokey. Mind you, you
  may get me, but I'll get one of you first. And you're the man, Wayler. You're
  the easiest target, and I've got you in my eye. Tell Pokey to back up!"</p>

  <p>His voice had lowered. He seemed preoccupied, and the preoccupation was
  plainly with his gun.</p>

  <p>Here Barry Christian arose and moved forward through the gloom. He called
  out:</p>

  <p>"Steady, boys. We'll have a new deal here."</p>

  <p>Pokey and Rooney stopped moving. Pudge Wayler got to one fat knee. And
  Duff Gregor moved with Naylor at the shoulders of their chief.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" called Rooney.</p>

  <p>"A man you all may need," said Christian.</p>

  <p>"It's the voice of Barry Christian!" yelled Wayler, jumping to his feet
  with surprising lightness.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" answered the steady Rooney. "I know&mdash;the whole world
  knows&mdash;that Christian's dead in the Kendal River."</p>

  <p>Barry Christian walked straight on into the lantern light. He said:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Pudge. Hello, Pokey. Glad to see you, Rooney, in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a wild yell from Pokey. He threw both arms high over his head
  and bolted for the door of the barn. He issued from it, his screeching of
  terror trailing behind him like blown flames behind a torch.</p>

  <p>"Let him go," said Christian. "He'll think it over and come back to
  see."</p>

  <p>"It's a lucky thing," said Rooney, "that I didn't mix myself up with that
  sort of a yellow hound."</p>

  <p>"Steady, Mr. Rooney," answered Christian. "Pokey is the sort that fights
  like a wild cat, but he's not used to ghosts."</p>

  <p>Big Pudge Wayler had put up his gun, and now he came forward with both
  hands stretched out before him, and his eyes popping in his fat, pale face.
  He actually grasped Christian with both hands, and then groaned out:</p>

  <p>"It's Barry&mdash;and no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused there, too overcome for speech. Christian seemed a little moved
  by this reception, for he slapped the shoulder of the fat man and
  answered:</p>

  <p>"There's not enough water in the world to soak me all the way through,
  Pudge. You boys get to know one another. Here's Bill Naylor, who pulled me
  out of the river. Here's Duff Gregor, who stood Crow's Nest on its head and
  nearly split the better part of a million with me. They've heard your names.
  You fellows all seemed to be trying to advertise one another. Shake hands and
  get acquainted."</p>

  <p>They shook hands all around&mdash;all except Rooney, who preferred to keep
  his gun out and scowl at the strangers.</p>

  <p>He was a regular bulldog type, with eyes buried under deep brows and a
  square, wide, projecting jaw.</p>

  <p>"You're not Barry Christian," he said. "This is a plant of some sort.
  Christian went down the Kendal River."</p>

  <p>"Look at me again, Rooney," said Christian. "You must have seen pictures
  of me. I can trust the newspapers to have spread pictures of me all over the
  land. Look at me again, and you'll recognize me."</p>

  <p>He stood close to the lantern that hung on the wall, and Rooney suddenly
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've got to believe my eyes," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"This is a lucky meeting, I hope, for both of us," said Christian, and,
  walking forward, he held out his hand.</p>

  <p>Rooney hesitated only an instant. Then, with a short, barking laugh, he
  put up his gun and accepted Christian's hand.</p>

  <p>"Except for the way Pokey acted," he said, "I think I'd still take it for
  a hoax. But Pokey wasn't on a stage when he ran out of the barn. Christian,
  what do you know of this deal I've been talking over?"</p>

  <p>"Only what I heard in this barn. I've been busy, lately, getting Gregor
  out of jail. We had to look sharp. His trial commences tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Once more admiration of the great criminal overwhelmed Naylor. After all,
  what other man would have been so true to his follower? What other man, in
  the first place, would even have dreamed of bribery in the case of the honest
  sheriff in Crow's Nest?</p>

  <p>And now, at the first turn of the cards, it seemed that Christian was
  about to step into another big deal.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Rooney, "I've read the papers about Duff Gregor. He's the one
  that filled the shoes of Jim Silver for a while. Well, that was even a bigger
  deal than the one I've been talking about."</p>

  <p>"Why, Rooney," said Christian, "we can't always talk in terms of millions.
  We have to pick up the chicken feed when we're pinched."</p>

  <p>He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Sit down in a circle," he advised, "and we'll go over the deal man to
  man."</p>

  <p>They sat down, and Christian took direction at once, saying:</p>

  <p>"First we have to settle with you, Pudge. Do you want me to come
  in&mdash;with Gregor and Naylor?"</p>

  <p>"Want you?" cried Wayler. "What else do I want as much? Want you? Why,
  we've got to have you!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Christian. "And you, Rooney. Will you do business with
  me?"</p>

  <p>Rooney smiled. "Of course I will," said he. "The only reason I opened up
  with the others was because I knew they'd once been your men. This is what I
  call a lucky meeting."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Christian, "we have to settle on your share first of all. You
  want a third, and that's just twice as much as you'll get from me."</p>

  <p>"Then the thing's off," Rooney said.</p>

  <p>"It certainly is," answered Christian. "I have to think about this deal,
  and I have to think about a hundred other deals that may be in the future.
  It's a matter of business policy. If I pay you a third for information, I'll
  have to pay the next man a half or two thirds."</p>

  <p>Rooney stared at him.</p>

  <p>"You're a sensible man," Christian said. "You're forty years old. You
  haven't made as much money as you think you need. You want a bigger income.
  And this is your way of getting it. I'll offer you fifty thousand if there's
  over three hundred thousand in the clean-up."</p>

  <p>"Not enough," growled Rooney.</p>

  <p>"It's three thousand dollars a year," said Barry Christian. "Look at it in
  that light. It's two hundred and fifty dollars a month. What would you do to
  have your salary increased by that much?"</p>

  <p>Rooney was silent, contemplative.</p>

  <p>"Besides," said Christian, "you know that when you work with me you are
  with a man who will cover you up. I'll take care of you. I'll see that you're
  protected. If the law hounds get on your track in any way, it won't be a leak
  through me. And I'll help you when the pinch comes."</p>

  <p>"I know your reputation, Christian," said Rooney, nodding. "When you make
  a deal, you follow it up and give&mdash;the good will of the firm!"</p>

  <p>He laughed briefly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Christian.</p>

  <p>"Well," Rooney muttered, "now that you're on the job, I suppose that it'll
  go through. I'll work with you at the cut rate, Christian. Here's my hand on
  it."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE TOWNSEND RANCH</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE name and a memory beside it began to fill the world of
  Bill Naylor. The name was Barry Christian; the memory was Jim Silver. Naylor
  wanted to keep Christian in the foreground and push Silver into the distance.
  Christian stood for everything that Naylor had wanted to be. Silver stood for
  everything that he felt he could not be. That was the difference between the
  name and the memory.</p>

  <p>Naylor took a very personal pleasure in the way in which Christian began
  to run things. He took a pleasure in the "pull" which Christian had.</p>

  <p>When they went back into the hills to get horses, provisions, and call in
  new members to the gang, wherever Christian appeared, things were easy. The
  party journeyed to a small ranch back in the hills. When they came into sight
  of it, Christian took Naylor with him, left the rest to camp among some
  trees, and rode down to bargain for horses.</p>

  <p>They found the owner of the ranch busily fencing in a small corral near
  his house. A girl with a flopping straw hat and a suit of faded blue overalls
  was helping at the work.</p>

  <p>As the pair of them came up, Christian called the man Townsend and hailed
  the girl as Sally. They made a great fuss. They came running over, Townsend
  trailing a crowbar with which he had been tamping the earth in around the
  fence posts. They grabbed the hand of Christian and hung onto it.</p>

  <p>"We thought the fish had you, Mr. Christian," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Christian smiled at her. "They'll get me later on&mdash;for dessert,
  maybe," he said. Then to Townsend: "You always had good horses in the old
  days. I need half a dozen of the best. Can I buy them from you?"</p>

  <p>"Having good horses is a habit that a gent don't wear out none too quick,"
  said Townsend. "Sally, go round up the hosses and run 'em into the corral
  yonder. Come inside, gents, and we'll have a drink. I got some corn liquor
  that's worth while."</p>

  <p>Townsend was a big man with a big, red face, and and a sun-faded growth of
  red hair on it. The hair was pale at the tip of the beard, and shining
  crimson near the skin from which it sprouted. He had a hearty manner and a
  smile unaffected, frank, open, and bold. He looked, in spite of his ragged
  beard, like a boy grown bigger than his years. The wrinkles around his eyes
  seemed to come from too much smiling and laughter, not from time.</p>

  <p>He took them into the house&mdash;it was a little three-room
  shack&mdash;and Bill Naylor admired out loud the neatness of the rooms.</p>

  <p>"That's Sally," said Townsend. "She's the sort of a girl that doesn't have
  to idle around all day to cook three meals. Every lick counts when Sally puts
  it in. She's that sort of a girl. When she cooks, what she turns out is worth
  eating. When she talks, what she says is worth hearing."</p>

  <p>Then he added: "Fetch up chairs. Sit around and make yourselves
  comfortable, partners. Christian, it's a great sight to me&mdash;seein' this
  here face of yours. I'd been thinkin' that Jim Silver had put you down at
  last."</p>

  <p>He brought out a jug of whisky. It was almost colorless. There was only a
  faint taint of yellow in it, but it tasted fairly mellow.</p>

  <p>"Sally made the whisky, too," said Townsend. "Her uncle had a still back
  in the hills a few years ago, and Sally learned how to run it. She made this
  stuff twelve years ago, believe it or not. And that was when she was ten
  years old. She was born with a brain and a pair of hands!"</p>

  <p>He set out a jam made of wild blackberries&mdash;Sally had made
  it&mdash;and some cold pone, and fresh butter that was rather
  white&mdash;"because there ain't much green grass now, and Sally won't use no
  artificial colorin' stuff in the churn." They washed down the mouthfuls with
  generous swigs of the moonshine.</p>

  <p>"What'll you do when Sally up and leaves you and marries?" asked Christian
  of the father.</p>

  <p>"The man that marries her is a man that can lick me," said Townsend,
  grinning, "and the gent that can lick me is the right kind of a husband for
  her. Come on out, boys. She's got the hosses into the corral. Doggone me if
  she can't whistle 'em into that corral in five minutes, where it always takes
  me half a day to run down the ornery broncs."</p>

  <p>He led the way out to the corral, where a fine twisting, racing, bounding
  crowd of mustangs, perhaps thirty in all, were flashing through the dust of
  their own raising. The girl had just dismounted from a tall brown gelding to
  run into place the last bar of the corral gate. She came around the fence
  toward the house; the tall gelding followed her, hunting at the pockets of
  her overalls as if for sugar or apples.</p>

  <p>Barry Christian stood right up on top of a fence post and stared down
  through the dust clouds and named the horses that he wanted. Townsend and
  Naylor went in and roped the selected animals. They were the pick of the lot.
  They might not be the prettiest, but they were the best. Naylor knew it, and
  he smiled to himself in admiration of his chief. Townsend said openly, when
  the five were tied outside the corral:</p>

  <p>"I hoped you wouldn't pick out that gray. He's a mean-looking, ugly devil,
  and I hoped that you wouldn't look at his legs and shoulders too hard. You've
  got the cream of the lot, Barry! That's five of 'em. Did you say that you
  want six?"</p>

  <p>"I want six," said Christian. "But I don't need any more of that lot. How
  about the brown gelding?"</p>

  <p>"He's not for sale," said the girl. "Doc belongs to me. He's not for
  sale."</p>

  <p>She had hoisted herself onto the top rail of the fence and sat there with
  one foot swinging. She wore narrow-toed boots like any cowpuncher, except
  that Bill Naylor had never seen a foot so small.</p>

  <p>"I'll bargain with you," said Christian. "I'll give you two hundred and
  fifty. Three hundred, we'll call it."</p>

  <p>"He's not for sale," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred flat," said Christian, folding his arms as he stood
  magnificently on the top of the post.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor looked up at him with a heightened admiration. Five hundred
  was a frightful price even for a horse that looked as sound and as fast as
  the gelding. "Not for sale," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Her foot had stopped swinging. She sat up straight and defied her father
  with her eye. Naylor forgot his admiration of his chief in order to look at
  the girl more closely. She was no beauty. Beauties don't have freckles, and
  their noses are straight. But there was something about her that fitted his
  idea of what a woman should be as closely as the butt of a Colt fitted the
  grip of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Not for sale at five hundred?" asked Christian.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," broke in Townsend. "Don't be such a fool, Sally. Sure,
  Doc is for sale at five hundred."</p>

  <p>"He's not," said the girl. "He belongs to me, and he's not for sale."</p>

  <p>"He belongs to me, if I want him," said Townsend angrily. "And he's sold
  if Christian offers five hundred. You can have the cash, but I want to teach
  you not to be a fool about a horse. A girl that'll be a fool about a horse
  will be ten times a fool about a man. I want you to keep your head in the
  pinches. Five hundred? It's too much! Sure, you can have the gelding,
  Barry!"</p>

  <p>"Try him, Naylor," said Christian.</p>

  <p>Naylor looked at the girl. The girl looked back at Naylor, and her face
  was a pale stone, hard set. Her eyes were glinting. She said not a word.</p>

  <p>Naylor took the colt, lengthened the stirrups of the girl's saddle, and
  swung up. The colt that had gone smooth as silk for Sally Townsend now
  developed plenty of kinks and pitched like a savage. But by that bucking,
  Naylor knew that the gelding was sound as a drum and made of steel wire and
  springing whalebone. He rode the colt until it was in hand and then came and
  dismounted.</p>

  <p>Christian stood on the ground now, at the side of Townsend, saying:</p>

  <p>"That's a good one, eh, Bill?"</p>

  <p>Naylor ran his thumb and forefinger through the sweat and gloss of the
  shoulder of the horse. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Weak in the legs, Barry," he answered. "Sort of horse that would let you
  down in a long day's work, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Hey!" cried Townsend. "What is the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He checked himself, for Christian was saying: "All right. We'll get along
  with only five horses. That'll be enough till we get to the next place."</p>

  <p>He gave a thick wad of money to Townsend who took it without counting and
  thrust it into his pocket. Townsend said to Naylor:</p>

  <p>"I dunno where you learned to judge hosses, kid."</p>

  <p>Naylor answered sharply: "I learned in a neck of the woods where every man
  has a right to his own opinion."</p>

  <p>Townsend started a retort: "Hoss sense is better than the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold on, Townsend," cautioned Christian. "I don't want any trouble
  between you and Naylor. Bill Naylor is one of my best men. You know,
  Townsend, you can't judge a bulldog by the shortness of his teeth!"</p>

  <p>He laughed, and Townsend chuckled, also. Only the girl, as Naylor noted,
  did not smile.</p>

  <p>While Naylor was getting the newly purchased horses together, Sally
  Townsend helped him, and she found a chance to say:</p>

  <p>"Listen, Bill. Have you picked the right line?"</p>

  <p>"What line?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Riding with Barry Christian," she answered.</p>

  <p>He looked at her in great surprise.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean by that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to hurt your feelings," said the girl. "But you're not mean
  enough to win out in a gang like that You have to be able to shoot around
  corners to live with Barry Christian's gang."</p>

  <p>Nothing in his life had ever stunned him so much except one
  thing&mdash;the strange conduct of Jim Silver in loosing Duff Gregor. His
  brain was still buzzing with the speech of the girl when at last he mounted
  that good gray with the ugly head and took the four other new horses on the
  lead.</p>

  <p>Not mean enough?</p>

  <p>All his life he had been "mean." Bigger and stronger boys, at school, had
  always avoided him because he was a "mean" fighter. When his back was to the
  wall, the rules had never counted with him. Now a slip of a girl told him
  that he was not "mean" enough to get on with the crew of Barry Christian!</p>

  <p>Well, he had saved her horse to her, and she had understood that. Women
  are funny, anyway. You never can understand them.</p>

  <p>He came out of his trance of reflection, as they rode away from the
  Townsend place, for Barry Christian was saying:</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to doubt you, back there. I wouldn't do that&mdash;with
  strangers looking on. But the next time I want you to remember that nothing
  comes between you and your work, when you're with me. I don't care what women
  are to you when you're not on the job. But when you ride with me, nothing
  exists except the business on hand."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; OUTLAW CREW</h2>

  <p class="first">THEY spent a week back in the hills, recruiting. By the end
  of that time, Christian's men were a dozen strong, and Barry Christian
  himself made No. 13.</p>

  <p>"That's a lucky number for us," said Christian, "because we work by the
  opposites of most people!"</p>

  <p>There was not a weak member of the crew. Pudge Wayler was fat, to be sure,
  and he was the oldest of the lot, but there was not a man, outside of
  Christian, who was handier with a gun, or shot straighter once it was free
  from leather. Wayler and Pokey had shared in a jail break while they were
  serving a long sentence that had been imposed after they were gathered in the
  net by Jim Silver, up at Horseshoe Flat.</p>

  <p>But every one of the others had done time, and plenty of it. Every one of
  them had worked with Christian in the past, and was prepared now to follow
  the great outlaw blindly. A harder lot, Bill Naylor had never seen. It was
  not easy for him to be afraid of other men, but of some of these fellows he
  was frankly in terror. If it came to a show-down, he knew that he would never
  take water; but there were fellows, like Pokey, who had no more humanity in
  them than a rattlesnake. They all accepted him and fraternized with him,
  because it was known that he had saved the life of the chief.</p>

  <p>During the week, the chief event was the arrival of a big chestnut
  stallion which was assigned at once to Duff Gregor. Gregor was an excellent
  rider, but every one knew that the reason the horse was assigned to him was
  because, on an animal like this, he had played the rle of Jim Silver in the
  town of Crow's Nest in that deal which had nearly put a million into the
  pockets of the outlaws. The fame of that deal was still ringing through the
  minds of men.</p>

  <p>The horse was carefully dyed with an equipment of four black stockings,
  and his other marks were altered so as to conform to the celebrated pattern
  that appeared in Parade. Then Duff Gregor was made up to resemble Jim Silver.
  Two gray spots were made to appear in his hair above the temples, and a dozen
  little glinting scars were caused to glimmer on his face.</p>

  <p>Naylor argued the point with his chief.</p>

  <p>"Barry," he said, "I've seen Parade, and I've seen Jim Silver. Nobody
  that's ever looked the pair of 'em in the face would ever think that this
  couple did more than wear the wrong names."</p>

  <p>Christian answered:</p>

  <p>"That's because you know there's a fraud. But people only see what they
  expect to see. Mind that! Besides, in the business we're following, no one
  ever wins without taking a mighty big chance!"</p>

  <p>Naylor wrote down those words in his own memory. That same day he had
  something new to think about.</p>

  <p>They had drifted down through the hills until they were fairly close to
  the town of Elsinore. The robbery was to take place the next day.</p>

  <p>The Overland, on whose route the town of Elsinore was no more than a flag
  station, came winding up toward the place through a narrow valley that had
  been cut out by a frothing, shouting creek. In that valley they were to stop
  the train and take their chance at getting to the safe which held the cash.
  The plans were all laid in detail.</p>

  <p>They had camped for the evening in a dense pine wood where they could
  venture on building a fire and having a hot meal.</p>

  <p>The dynamite had been cooked down, and the soup that was drawn off had
  been confided to the care of a yegg named Steve Cassidy. The rest of the men
  were gathered around the fire, except for two outposts, who walked on guard.
  And while the talk went quietly around, and Barry Christian worked sedulously
  on the drawing of a map of the surrounding country, there was a sudden
  outbreak of noise from the direction of one of the outposts.</p>

  <p>The noise brought all the men to their feet. Naylor noticed that they gave
  only one glance toward Christian; after that, each was ready to stand on his
  own defense, and form his own plans. In truth, they were a hand-picked
  lot.</p>

  <p>Then, running through the trees toward them, came the voice of Pokey.</p>

  <p>He was calling: "Barry! Barry! Hell has broke loose!"</p>

  <p>He came panting and gasping into the firelight. His white, sweating face
  was wild with fear and excitement. He was making gestures with both hands, as
  usual.</p>

  <p>"Barry, there's hell popping!" he cried, and ran up to his chief.</p>

  <p>Christian changed a little in face and color, also. He said:</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing in the world that can make you act up like this,
  Pokey. It's Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>The name struck cold chills down the back of Naylor. He saw the other men
  start, and he heard the quick, deep intake of their breath.</p>

  <p>The name of Silver was lightning in every mind, it was plain.</p>

  <p>Then Pokey was gasping out: "Yes! Jim Silver! It's Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>"Where?" said Christian. "Get yourself together, you fool! Did you let him
  trail you out of Elsinore? I should have had more sense than to let you go
  into that town. Where is he now? On your trail?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's back there&mdash;back there in Elsinore!" said Pokey.</p>

  <p>The courage of Pokey seemed to return, with his breath. It seemed to
  Naylor a wonderful thing that a mere glimpse of a man who remained now many
  miles away should maintain such terror in the heart of another. But that man
  was Jim Silver; Pokey had clashed with him once before, and those who had
  battled with Jim Silver once had sufficient cause to remember him
  forever.</p>

  <p>Pokey, as he recovered his breath and his presence of mind, said: "It sort
  of hit me all in a heap. I turned around a corner, and there was Jim Silver!
  Right there in front of me!"</p>

  <p>"And he saw you?" demanded Christian.</p>

  <p>"There was a gang around him. There's always a gang around Silver. The
  fools that want to shake hands with him, and the crooks that want to 'borrow'
  money from him. They were thick around Silver. He was sort of wading through
  them, smiling a little, the way he does. I side-stepped into a shadow and did
  a quick fade-away. All the way back, I've been seeing the ghost of him
  sliding along after me, not making any noise, stepping out easy and slow and
  silent, the way Silver does."</p>

  <p>"You marched out of Elsinore the minute you found out that Silver was in
  town, eh?" demanded Christian, with a certain quiet and sinister meaning in
  his voice.</p>

  <p>"No, not just that," sad Pokey. "I'm not such a fool as that. I went
  around to the hotel first, and found out that Silver was staying there.
  They've given him the best room in the hotel, looking over the main street,
  with three windows in it, and all of that!"</p>

  <p>"Good work," said Christian. "Because so long as I know that, I can know
  one other thing&mdash;that Jim Silver will die in that room to-night."</p>

  <p>Silence oppressed the others. With vaguely hopeful eyes that looked toward
  Christian, who was walking up and down beside the fire, the gang expected the
  plan of the action that was to wipe Jim Silver off the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>Christian said: "You fellows expect something clever. But there's no need
  to be clever. We have an edge on all the rest of the people that ever
  measured themselves against Silver. Because Silver thinks that Barry
  Christian is dead, and the result is that he's stepping out big and bold.
  He's been in the habit of sleeping with only one eye open for
  years&mdash;since he first met me. But now he thinks that he can take it
  easy. Well, he'll find out that he's wrong!"</p>

  <p>He stopped in his walking and looked over the crowd.</p>

  <p>"What ones of you fellows will volunteer to go with me to-night and take a
  crack at Silver?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. Of all those hardy fellows, there was not a
  single one who would willingly put himself in the peril of Silver. Not one,
  for the sake of praise and rewards from Christian, would volunteer to ride on
  that service.</p>

  <p>Christian said slowly, but without contempt in his voice: "You understand
  what I've just been saying&mdash;that the game is practically in our hands,
  that Silver doesn't expect danger of this kind, and that therefore we'll be
  striking him doubly from the dark? Think it over, boys, and volunteer if you
  want to."</p>

  <p>Naylor felt a strange tug at his heartstrings; it was like the impulse a
  man feels to throw himself from a height.</p>

  <p>Then Pudge Wayler was saying: "Well, a fellow can only die once. I've
  stood in front of Silver in the old days, and I reckon that I can stand there
  again. I'll ride with you, if you want me, Barry."</p>

  <p>"You're the best man that I could have along," answered Christian. "You
  have a pair of hands, and you have a head. One more is all that I'll ask
  for."</p>

  <p>Pokey broke out: "You think I'm scared to death. And I am. Anybody with
  sense is scared after he's nearly rubbed shoulders with that man-eater and
  got off alive. But I'll go back there with you, Barry. I may be shaking
  inside, but my hand won't shake any, you can bet."</p>

  <p>Christian said: "I'd as soon have you and Pudge as any two men in the
  world. There's no hurry. Pick out three good horses. We have plenty of time
  to get to Silver's hotel room before he gets there to go to bed. He'll die
  like Billy the Kid&mdash;in the dark."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; NAYLOR'S PLAN</h2>

  <p class="first">AN ODD, shaking nervousness possessed Bill Naylor. It was a
  thing that made time seem to rush past him as it speeds by a man condemned to
  death. It sent him quivering away to the place where the horses were
  picketed. It made him pick out the long-bodied, ugly-headed gray horse which
  Townsend had said was the pick of his mustangs. Bill Naylor had a saddle on
  the back of that horse before he realized with a clear brain that the imp of
  the perverse was driving him to do a deed of folly.</p>

  <p>However, the impulse was a thing which he could by no means resist. He
  found himself in the saddle, and working the horse gradually away among the
  trees. Behind him, the voices of his companions in crime soon faded out. They
  would not be coming this way too quickly. Christian had said that there was
  plenty of time. But there was not plenty of time for Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was at a distance which would cover the beating of the hoofs
  of his horse from the ears of those wild wolves back there at the camp,
  Naylor put the mustang to a lope. The trees swayed steadily past him. They
  climbed the hill. They dropped into the shallow of the valley. There was no
  moon, and Naylor was glad of that. For he felt that by even the light of a
  candle he would be able to examine his heart and his mind and see that he was
  making an utter fool of himself. Yet he would not for anything give up the
  plan that he had already conceived.</p>

  <p>He climbed the next hill. Off to his left the railroad tracks ran with a
  dull glimmering, like two narrow ribbons of water, toward the lights of the
  town, a handful of trembling yellow rays. Those lights spread out gradually
  and separated, and grew individually brighter as he approached Still the
  mustang kept up that steady lope, half trot and half gallop, the lazy swing
  of the hind legs seeming to trundle the forequarters effortlessly over the
  ground. Bill Townsend had been right when he called this horse one of the
  best.</p>

  <p>As Naylor came out of the sweet air of pines, the wind was blowing toward
  him from the town the acrid scent of wood smoke. It smelled to him like
  danger, the hot iron of danger. But he went on.</p>

  <p>When he came to the edge of the town, he took lanes and alleys in order to
  work his way to the center of things. He tied the gray in front of the first
  saloon he encountered after turning into the main street. Into the saloon
  itself he sauntered, laid money on the bar, and asked for a drink. There was
  not another patron in the place.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Naylor of the barkeeper. "This town going
  dry?"</p>

  <p>The bartender was a sour little man with a twisted face. He walked the
  bottle of whisky down the varnished bar and halted it in front of Naylor.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot of half-wits in this town," he said, "that would rather
  talk than drink, when anything happens. And with a gent like Silver in town,
  they'd rather stand around and shift their weight from one leg to another
  than stand at a bar and make themselves comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Well, Silver's quite a man," suggested Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. He's a man. But whisky's always whisky," said the barkeeper.</p>

  <p>"True," said Naylor. "Lemme have another. Where's Silver now?"</p>

  <p>The bartender laughed, his face twisting more than ever.</p>

  <p>"Where none of these gents can see him," said he. "Silver's back in the
  rear room of Tod Wilson's place with the door locked, drinking beer with
  Taxi. Nacherally, he don't want no strangers around when he's drinking with
  Taxi, does he? But Tod's barroom is packed-just because they all aim to get a
  look at Silver when he comes out from talking with Taxi, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Naylor finished drinking his second whisky, which he had poured very
  small, and went to Tod Wilson's place. It was not hard to find. The movements
  of the men in the street were all toward that saloon, and the sidewalk was
  filled with people who slowly oozed into the place, and slowly trickled out
  again.</p>

  <p>For half a minute, Naylor stood still and considered the throng. That was
  what it meant to be an honest man. Others were willing to give up their
  minds, their time, their money for a mere glimpse of such a fellow as Jim
  Silver. But Silver had paid for this attention with blood. He would pay more
  blood, before very long. He might very well pay for it with his death before
  morning.</p>

  <p>Naylor made no effort to get through the front door. Instead, he went down
  the side of the low shack, climbed a high board fence, and dropped into the
  back yard. All the rear end of the house was in darkness, except for one eye
  of light that leaked out at the corner of a shutter.</p>

  <p>Naylor put his eye to that peek hole and found himself looking into a
  small room that had foot-worn linoleum on the floor, two or three small
  tables, and chairs around them. At one of the tables sat the Great Jim
  Silver, tilting a little back in his chair. Opposite him was a much smaller
  man, more slenderly made, with a dark and almost handsome face. The fringe of
  the long eyelashes made a distinct streak on his face, like a dark pencil
  marking. And he rarely looked up from his task.</p>

  <p>That task was unique enough almost to identify him. For he had in front of
  him a small lock of polished steel, and as he worked over it, probing with a
  sliver of steel at the interior of the lock, sometimes he lowered his head
  and appeared to listen to the delicacy of the work which he was carrying on
  inside the lock.</p>

  <p>That was Taxi, of course, the lock master, who could walk through the most
  complicated bolts and bars as if he possessed a magic gift. And now, as he
  sat opposite his best friend&mdash;who could tell how long they had been
  separated, and how many strange adventures had befallen each of them since
  the last meeting?&mdash;Taxi kept his attention riveted on the lock before
  him, and appeared to give very little heed to the words of famous Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>Then, though there had not been a single sound, the head of Taxi turned
  with flashing speed, and he stared at the very shutter through which Naylor
  was peering. It was a startling thing to see those eyes, strangely pale and
  bright beneath the obscuring shadow of the lashes. It was like something in a
  dream, and a bad dream, at that.</p>

  <p>That single, dangerous glance was all that Taxi gave toward the window.
  Then he returned his attention to his lock. One could not tell whether he
  were nodding and faintly smiling because of the pleasure he took in his task,
  or whether it was because of what the soft, grave voice of Jim Silver was
  saying.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Naylor, as he looked in on those two celebrated fellows, that
  the difference between them was like the difference between panther and
  lion.</p>

  <p>Naylor went to the rear of the house, found a door, discovered that it was
  unlocked, and pulled it open. He stepped straight into the room where Silver
  and Taxi had been seated. They were seated no longer. They were both
  standing, looking curiously toward the opening of the door.</p>

  <p>There was no more chance of surprising that pair than of surprising a
  couple of wild cats, lean with hunger, in the winter of the year.</p>

  <p>Naylor came slowly in toward them.</p>

  <p>"The man who set Gregor free," he heard the quiet voice of Silver say.
  "Taxi, meet Mr. Naylor."</p>

  <p>Taxi looked at Naylor with a curling lip. He seemed ready to spring at the
  newcomer's throat. But he took Naylor's hand and merely muttered:</p>

  <p>"Jim, I can't follow your ideas, half the time."</p>

  <p>"I want to see you," said Naylor to Silver.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see me alone?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Yes, alone."</p>

  <p>"Outside?"</p>

  <p>"That's the best place," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He started toward the door, but Taxi exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Jim, what are you thinking about? Step out there into the dark with him?
  You might as well step into the mouth of a tiger!"</p>

  <p>Silver lifted his hand with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"There are always chances, Taxi," he said, "but I'll bet on this one."</p>

  <p>Christian had said something like that, as Naylor could remember. Was
  there, after all, some kind of a peculiar affinity between the two great
  enemies?</p>

  <p>Then Naylor found himself outside the house and standing in the dimness of
  the starlight beside Silver. He knew, as he stood there, that no matter what
  might come out of the future, he had been right in making the ride.</p>

  <p>"Silver," he said, "you did me a good turn, and I want to do you
  another."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Silver. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you not to go back to your room in the hotel,
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"I'm not to go back to the room in the hotel," echoed Silver quietly. "And
  why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because there might be trouble waiting for you."</p>

  <p>"Ah? How soon will the trouble be there?"</p>

  <p>"I'm asking you," said Naylor, "not to go back to your room. If you fish
  around to find trouble&mdash;well, you may find it, all right, but you'll
  land me in the soup. I'm asking you to take my word for it and let the thing
  go. Will you do that?"</p>

  <p>Silver was silent. In the darkness, he looked bigger than ever, to Naylor.
  He looked so big a target that a child could hardly fail to hit him, even in
  the obscurity of an unlighted room. Starlight was enough for the shooting of
  a prize of this rating.</p>

  <p>Suppose that he, Bill Naylor, pulled a gun and tried a point-blank shot
  for the heart&mdash;well, he would be famous forever. It hardly mattered how
  a man like Jim Silver was killed. To be his slayer was to go down in history.
  And, in the old days, Naylor felt that the opportunity would have been a sad
  temptation.</p>

  <p>But he found himself saying to the big, silent man: "I can't talk names to
  you. All I can do is to give you some advice&mdash;and ask you not to pull me
  into the soup."</p>

  <p>Silver said, at last: "All right. I had an idea when I left you before,
  that there'd be something good coming out of you, Naylor. I'm thanking you
  now just as though I could look inside my room in the hotel and see the men
  and the guns waiting for me. But"&mdash;here he sighed&mdash;"you don't want
  me to trap 'em?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Naylor. "I'd be a&mdash;a traitor, if you did."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to be that," answered Silver. "Come in and have a drink
  with me."</p>

  <p>"I'm overdue in another place," said Naylor. "I was overdue the second
  that I left it."</p>

  <p>"And your neck's in danger now?" said Silver. "You're in trouble on
  account of me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not in trouble on account of you," said Naylor suddenly, the words
  taking command of him. "I'm in trouble because I've been a crook and a thug
  all the days of my life."</p>

  <p>He gripped the hand of Jim Silver with a sudden gesture and then hurried
  away into the darkness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; SALLY'S DECISION</h2>

  <p class="first">IN SPITE of Naylor's hurry, in spite of the fact that there
  might be literal danger to his neck if he were missed during this long
  absence, he did not aim straight back at the camp, but swung a little to the
  south of the straight line and came out through the hills in sight of the
  Townsend ranch.</p>

  <p>There was a moon, by this time. It stood in the east like a pale ship of
  an ancient design, and the light from it blanched the hills and painted long
  black shadows beside them.</p>

  <p>Naylor rode down to the rear of the hay shed and there tethered the gray
  horse and pulled off its saddle After that, he went to the side of the little
  ranch house. He felt that it was a lucky break that had brought him into the
  house not many days before, so that now he knew in which room the girl slept.
  Standing at the low window, he tapped lightly on the sill.</p>

  <p>When he had no answer, he leaned a little across the sill and listened. He
  could hear regular breathing, and there was a faint delicacy of perfume in
  the air. That was strange, he thought. She was not the sort of a girl to use
  perfume. But one never can tell about women. It is best not to waste time
  trying to foretell their characters.</p>

  <p>He hissed, and rapped the sill of the window again.</p>

  <p>The regular noise of the breathing ended; there was a creaking of springs,
  and then:</p>

  <p>"Who's there?"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet," commanded Naylor. "No robber, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Hi!" he heard her say, under her breath. "It's Bill Naylor!"</p>

  <p>The moon slanted into the room and hit the foot of the bed. In the thick
  of the darkness beyond the moonlight, vaguely he saw the girl get out of the
  bed and throw a bath robe around her. She came toward him. Her bare, brown
  feet walked through the moonlight. The feet looked soft. The ankles were
  small and gave inward slightly. She walked like an Indian, toeing straight
  ahead. Her elbows were up as she swung her long hair into a knot behind her
  head. Then she sat down on the window sill.</p>

  <p>It had not taken her five seconds, he thought, to get from the bed to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Bill," said she. "How's things?"</p>

  <p>"So, so," said Naylor. He had taken off his hat, and now he grinned at
  her. He wished, suddenly, that he were inches taller. He almost wished that a
  face surgeon could work for a time on his face to make him more handsome. For
  now that he could not see the freckles across her nose, the girl looked
  beautiful to him. She was sun-browned like an Indian, but she was
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Is this a dog-gone serenade, or something?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Quit it, will you?" said Bill Naylor. "If I started caterwauling, you'd
  think that a wolf had come down out of the hills."</p>

  <p>"D'you wanta see dad, then?" she asked. "He's a light sleeper, and the
  whisky jug isn't sealed."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Naylor. "You think that I'd ride all this way for the sake
  of a drink?"</p>

  <p>"Go on, tell me why you came," urged the girl. "Say something nice, and
  tell me why you came, will you?"</p>

  <p>She put her chin on her fist and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"How deep are you laughing at me?" asked Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Skin-deep," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Skin-deep, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," she said. "That's as far as beauty goes."</p>

  <p>She laughed, silently, shaking with her mirth.</p>

  <p>"Quit it, will you?" said Naylor. "I'm no handsome bird. I know that."</p>

  <p>"Just a good, dependable, home boy, eh?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She kept on laughing. She was always laughing. There was a river of mirth
  pulsing in her throat like a song. Her teeth flashed in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>He made a cigarette, lighted it, and blew out smoke. The smoke was as
  silver-pale as frosted fog, in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"I had to rush over here and tell you something," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Rush on with it, then," said the girl, nodding.</p>

  <p>He came up close to the window sill and took hold of her hand. There was
  nothing scary about her. She was as steady as a man. There was nothing silly
  or simpering about her, either. She looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said he.</p>

  <p>"Have you scalped somebody?" asked the girl. "What's the matter with you,
  being all nervous, like this?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't nervous," argued he. "I'm just telling you something. What time
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"That's not telling me anything. That's asking something."</p>

  <p>"Quit kidding me. What time is it, about?"</p>

  <p>"It struck one, a little while back."</p>

  <p>"You went to bed when?"</p>

  <p>"Ten thirty. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "I wanta tell you something. You went to bed at ten
  thirty, and about eleven o'clock, just as you were getting your eyes
  shut&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean it takes me half an hour to go to sleep?" said Sally Townsend.
  "Don't be silly. At the end of a Townsend day on this man's ranch nobody
  needs to be sung to sleep. When my head hits the pillow, I'm out like a
  light. But what're you driving at?"</p>

  <p>"Give me a chance to tell you, will you? At about eleven o'clock, just
  after you hit the hay, you heard a tapping at the window, and you sat up and
  saw me looking in. I'd come over here from the camp. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said the girl. "What did you come for?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I just come over. You see? Don't forget it. And I stayed around
  here talking with you for a couple of hours. I've been here since eleven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Bill," said the girl, "what are you trying to put over on
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not putting nothing over. I'm asking you to do me a good turn, that
  is all."</p>

  <p>"Then come clean, will you?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, come clean?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it. You been out gadding?"</p>

  <p>"I've been out," said Naylor. "That's all I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Who'll check you up for playing hookey?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Somebody who's worse than the devil when he gets riled."</p>

  <p>"You mean Barry Christian?"</p>

  <p>"That's who I mean."</p>

  <p>He sighed as he said it.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the girl, "have you crossed up Barry in any way,
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"No matter what I've done," said he, "I'm asking you to do me a good
  turn."</p>

  <p>"Does it sound as simple as all of that to you?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? You just let people know&mdash;if they should happen
  to ask&mdash;that I arrived here at eleven and didn't leave till after
  one."</p>

  <p>"That'll be fine for me!" said the girl grimly. "Look here, Bill. You're
  not that sort of a fellow. You don't want to get me into that sort of a jam,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Why, suppose you had a sister or a daughter, or something, and she got
  out of bed and talked to a man she'd only seen once before&mdash;talked to
  him for a couple of hours? What would you think? What would you do?"</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean," said Bill Naylor slowly. "I didn't think about
  that. I'm just dumb, I guess. Forget about what I asked you to say; go back
  to bed and go to sleep, Sally."</p>

  <p>"And what comes of you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm all right. I'll get through, all right. There won't be any
  pinch."</p>

  <p>"If there is, you'll be dead from it. I know Barry Christian as well as
  you do. Listen, Bill. What crazy thing have you done to Barry Christian?"</p>

  <p>"I should be telling you, eh?" asked Naylor.</p>

  <p>"You were telling me that you called on me at eleven and didn't leave till
  one."</p>

  <p>A little thrill of desperation ran coldly through his nerves. He gave her
  hand a hard grip. He stuck out his jaw and looked her right in the face.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I did, beautiful," said he. "I'll tell you that
  Silver's in Elsinore; and Barry Christian knows he's there; and Christian and
  a couple more are lying in Silver's hotel room, right now, waiting for him to
  come in. But Silver won't come in. He won't&mdash;because I told him to stay
  away. I didn't tell him what was in his room. I told him to stay away from
  it."</p>

  <p>"Did you actually do that?" whispered the girl. "Did you mix up between
  Christian and Jim Silver?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I'm bright, I guess," said Bill Naylor. "I mixed in between them,
  and now I'll catch it. I don't know what's the matter with me," he added, in
  a faintly groaning complaint. "I never made a fool of myself like this
  before!"</p>

  <p>"Look, Bill," said the girl, "maybe you're a better man than you ever
  thought. I told you that you were too soft to play around with Barry
  Christian and his gang."</p>

  <p>"That was because you softened me up a little," argued Naylor. "I'm hard
  enough, beautiful. Don't let anybody tell you nothing different. I'm hard
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Hard enough to do time, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, plenty," said Bill Naylor. "Well, I gotta go and sashay back to the
  camp. So long, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"While I think. I gotta think something out."</p>

  <p>"Go on and think, then," said Naylor. "You can think just as well while
  I'm on the road."</p>

  <p>"No. I'm just thinking that maybe you did get here at eleven and stay till
  one. I don't care what people say."</p>

  <p>"I do, though," said Naylor. "I was a tramp to ever ask you to say that. I
  didn't think."</p>

  <p>"Quit it. I've got to think," she said.</p>

  <p>She dropped her chin on her fist again. The moon painted her frown black.
  It made her face look old. Her nostrils quivered and expanded a little.
  Naylor saw how she would appear when she was ten years older. But he hardly
  cared. She would always look good to him.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, with a sigh, "people can go hang. You got here at eleven
  o'clock, all right."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. I won't put that over on you."</p>

  <p>"You can't help yourself. That's the story I tell. If you don't stick to
  it, you make a fool out of me and maybe you lose your scalp. Be yourself,
  Bill. Wake up and be yourself."</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a long time, feature by feature.</p>

  <p>"Sally," said Naylor, "you're not very old or very big, but you're great.
  You know that? You're great."</p>

  <p>"We were talking about something for two hours," said the girl. She
  chuckled suddenly. "That was what we were talking about. You came over to
  tell me that I was great. It was something I didn't know and I wanted to hear
  about it. I heard about it for two hours, sitting right here on the window
  sill."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Naylor. "That's all right. We were talking about you. I'll
  tell you what, I came over here to tell you that I'm nutty about you,
  Sally."</p>

  <p>"That's a good one, too," said Sally. She chuckled again. "Good old Bill,"
  she said. "That's all right, too."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Bill Naylor. "I am nutty about you. You're the
  goods. I'm crazy about you, Sally!"</p>

  <p>"Good old Bill," she repeated. "What a lingo you've got. You're a regular
  snake charmer."</p>

  <p>"Am I talking like a fool?" said Naylor. "Anyway, I mean what I say. I
  don't know how to make you believe me. I never talked to a girl like
  this."</p>

  <p>"No?" said she.</p>

  <p>"The females all back up and shy when they see my map," said Bill. "I
  never had a chance to work up any lingo, you know. It's my tough mug that
  stops 'em at a distance."</p>

  <p>"It's a good enough mug," said the girl. "It ought to wear pretty well,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>"I gotta be going," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"So long," said the girl. "If you get back quick and sneak in, maybe
  nobody'll spot you."</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Naylor. "You think of things."</p>

  <p>"Go on, then. Hurry it up, Bill."</p>

  <p>He started to turn away, but could not move his feet.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to go," said Naylor. "Because there's nobody like you. I feel
  pretty dog-gone queer, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Where?" said she.</p>

  <p>He put his arms around her. She sat up straight on the window sill and
  looked into his face.</p>

  <p>"You'd better do some thinking," she said.</p>

  <p>"I've done more thinking right here than I've done in all the rest of my
  life," said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Have you?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>She put her hand on his forehead and pushed her fingers back through the
  tough scrub of his hair, tilting back his head till the moon got at his
  face.</p>

  <p>"You are a tough-looking mug," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I'm something fierce to look at. If you're doing any
  thinking&mdash;I've been in for everything from smuggling to stick-up work. I
  ain't even been bright. Any dumb cop could pinch me. Only I'm crazy about
  you, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the girl, "I've been doing some thinking, too."</p>

  <p>"About what?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About the way you arrived at eleven, and you told me you were crazy about
  me, and I said I was crazy about you. That would take a couple of hours, all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Hold on," said Naylor hoarsely. His whole body began to shudder. "You
  have to think it all out before you talk like that. This is for good and
  all."</p>

  <p>"Sure it is," said Sally Townsend. "But I wish that you wouldn't go back
  to Barry Christian. Not if you know Jim Silver well enough to even brush his
  boots with your best hat!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; IN THE MORNING</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Bill Naylor got back to the camp, he used a very simple
  device for getting past the outer guard. He simply took saddle and bridle off
  the gray mustang and then walked beside it carrying the paraphernalia. On
  that side of the camp stalked the lengthy form of "Crane."</p>

  <p>Bushwick. He stopped long enough to whistle softly to the mustang, and
  then to laugh as the horse came edging on, worked along by the nudging elbows
  of Naylor, who walked bent over on the farther side.</p>

  <p>Crane Bushwick went on with his beat, humming softly to himself, paying no
  heed, for a number of the horses had been turned loose to graze beyond the
  trees which sheltered the camp. And as the gray mustang walked ahead, Naylor
  was presently in the safe sanctuary of the pines.</p>

  <p>There, in a small clearing, he hobbled the gray as most of the other
  horses were hobbled, and he paused long enough to rub down the mustang with
  bunches of pine needles. For if there were an examination, he did not wish
  the horse to show the encrusted sweat that is always present after a long and
  hard ride.</p>

  <p>Finally, there was the move to get to his blankets. He had made up his
  bunk on the outer rim of the fire-lighted circle, and now from the shelter of
  a big tree trunk he looked over the scene. The firelight, he was glad to see,
  had dwindled. The fire was almost out, and the embers stared with steady, red
  eyes. Only when a breeze worked in among the trees was there an upward
  flickering of the flame that set all the scene around wavering like a thing
  seen beneath rippling waves.</p>

  <p>He made sure that all of the men were in their places. He found only three
  made-up blanket beds which were empty&mdash;those of the three men who had
  ridden to town to waylay Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor shook his head when he thought of how he had forestalled them!
  His whole code of faith was much perturbed by the thing he had done. To Bill
  Naylor it had always been proper to serve one's own ends in most affairs, but
  when occupied in any sort of work, one must serve one's comrades as oneself.
  In this case, he had deliberately thwarted his great man, his Barry
  Christian, by carrying the warning to Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>Naylor could not tell what to think of his own conduct. There was one
  solitary consolation, and this was that of the girl, Sally Townsend, had
  seemed to approve. She was, to be sure, only a woman; but she was certainly
  unlike all others of her sex.</p>

  <p>Even about Sally his feelings were mixed. Suppose that his old comrades of
  many illegal adventures were to hear that he had married, what would they
  say? What was he himself to say of the thought? Was he fit to marry a decent
  person? What sort of a future could he offer to her?</p>

  <p>He thought of those things as he stood behind the pine tree, looking over
  the camp. Finally he muttered to himself: "You're bein' a fool, Bill
  Naylor!"</p>

  <p>This quiet comment from his own lips set him in motion toward his
  blankets. He had reached them unobserved, he was certain when the flame of
  the fire reached a resinous knot in a bit of firewood and made it explode
  with a loud, snapping noise.</p>

  <p>Some one grunted, and as Naylor sank down on his blankets, he saw a figure
  sitting bolt upright on the far side of the fire. It was Steve Cassidy, yegg
  extraordinary. And as he said nothing, but simply stared, Naylor was assured
  that the safe blower had ugly thoughts in his mind.</p>

  <p>He wished, as he fell asleep, that any man in the camp, other than Steve
  Cassidy, had seen him.</p>

  <p>Once before morning, Naylor wakened, and was aware of a hushed bustling
  around him. Three men had just returned. He opened one eye and observed
  them.</p>

  <p>He saw the tall, gaunt form of Pokey and heard him mutter:</p>

  <p>"Rottenest luck I ever heard of!"</p>

  <p>Well, that was one thing finished. It was apparent that they had returned
  without doing any harm to Jim Silver, and it was also apparent that Jim
  Silver had not taken advantage of the information he had received in order to
  do harm to them.</p>

  <p>About this second point Bill Naylor did a good deal of thinking, as he lay
  awake for a moment and stared up past the narrow points of the evergreens
  into the blue-black of the sky. He could see a swarm of little stars, a cloud
  of them, and in addition there was one big bluish point of fire. Was it a
  planet or was it a star of the first magnitude? He could not tell, but he had
  a feeling that that was the way Jim Silver shone among other men, no matter
  how bright the rest might be.</p>

  <p>On that thought he went to sleep again and when he roused the next
  morning, he discovered that every one else was already astir. The gray of the
  dawn had ended and the golden time had begun. And beside him stood Pudge
  Wayler, in the very act of poking him in the ribs again with the toe of a
  boot.</p>

  <p>The indignity enraged Bill Naylor and got him to his knees in a flash.</p>

  <p>He was ready to hit Wayler when the sour, rumbling voice of the other man
  said:</p>

  <p>"If you wanta fight, save it for the chief. He wants to talk to you,
  brother."</p>

  <p>Well, the fight went suddenly out of Naylor, at that. He got into his
  boots, washed his face and hands and shaved at the nearest run of water, and
  then went to where fragrant steam was rising from the big pot where coffee
  was being made. Barry Christian already was poising a tin cup on his knee. He
  looked up calmly at Naylor as the latter came to him. And suddenly Naylor
  found an exact parallel for the color and the brightness of those eyes; for
  he could remember how Taxi had looked toward the shuttered window the night
  before.</p>

  <p>The outlaw chief said, simply: "You got in pretty late, last night. Where
  were you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no place," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>It was the speech of a fool, and he felt like a fool after he had uttered
  it.</p>

  <p>"Think it over," said Christian. "You were somewhere, I guess. You got in
  late. Cassidy saw you get in at pretty near two o'clock this morning. Where
  were you?"</p>

  <p>Cassidy was a fellow with a crumpled, broken face. He had a broken jaw and
  a broken nose. His blond hair was always rumpled. His brow was constantly
  disturbed by a troubled frown. Now he looked wearily toward Naylor, and up
  and down Naylor's body. It was plain that he did not care about any man's
  displeasure. Certainly he was not concerned as to whether or not Naylor
  disapproved of him.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor said: "I don't want to make a fool of myself. I'll tell you
  the first time we're alone, chief. I'll tell you where I was."</p>

  <p>Barry Christian looked right through him.</p>

  <p>"You might as well speak out now. You know that I went in with Pudge and
  Pokey last night, to wait for Jim Silver in his room. We found the room, all
  right. We waited there all night. But Jim Silver never showed up! It looked
  as though somebody had warned him that there might be trouble in that room
  last night. Well, no one could have warned him from this camp. Everybody was
  accounted for&mdash;except you! And you got in about two o'clock. Where were
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said Pokey, under his breath, "where were you?"</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Naylor, repeating the idea as though in loathing of it,
  "you mean that I might have sneaked in ahead and warned Jim Silver, might 'a'
  told him that you were going to wait for him in his room?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean. You're not a fool, Bill," said Christian. "That's
  what I mean, all right. Now tell me where you were!"</p>

  <p>"Why," said Naylor, "did Silver jump you and try to bag you? You mean to
  say that the three of you got through a trap that Silver set for you, and
  none of you hurt?"</p>

  <p>"He means," explained Pudge Wayler, speaking to himself, "that if Silver
  had had word, he wouldn't 'a' let it go with just staying away from the room.
  He would 'a' tried to bag us. I dunno. I didn't think of that."</p>

  <p>Christian suddenly stood up and dashed his coffee cup to the ground. His
  voice, usually so persuasive and soft, rang thundering against the frightened
  ears of the guilty man.</p>

  <p>"Answer me! Where were you, Naylor?"</p>

  <p>"Chief," said Naylor, "I was only over seeing a girl. That was all."</p>

  <p>"A girl? A girl?" exclaimed Barry Christian. "What girl? I was
  afraid&mdash;and now I'm practically sure! Naylor, if you've come between me
  and Jim Silver, no matter what you've done for me, no matter if you're more
  than a brother to me, I'll have the best blood out of your heart&mdash;and
  I'll have it now! What girl are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Barry," said Naylor, "I mean the Townsend girl. That's all I mean. I
  went over to talk to her last night. I thought that it might be the last
  chance."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it is&mdash;maybe it was!" said Christian savagely.</p>

  <p>He stared at Naylor, and his eyes were more like the eyes of Taxi than
  ever&mdash;balls of pale fire. His whole face grew pale. It seemed to Naylor
  as luminous as steel.</p>

  <p>"Pokey&mdash;Cassidy&mdash;take the guns off Naylor, and cart him over to
  the Townsend place. Get the facts out of the Townsend girl. If you think that
  Naylor has lied&mdash;shoot him dead, and come back here. Lay him dead right
  across the threshold of the Townsend ranch house. It'll teach some of these
  ranchers what it means to double-cross Barry Christian."</p>

  <p>That was the way they went about it.</p>

  <p>Yonder in the town of Elsinore was Jim Silver, who had kept faith and
  declined to bag scoundrels who were lying in wait for him in the darkness of
  his own room. Jim Silver had kept faith perfectly. But here with Barry
  Christian it was a different matter.</p>

  <p>Then another thought occured to Bill Naylor. He told himself that no man
  could lead as Christian led unless he had a soul as hard as chilled steel. No
  man could go on to so many triumphs unless he had the cruelly stern nature of
  Christian. If one man failed Christian and the gang, that man had to go to
  the wall were he Christian's own brother!</p>

  <p>Naylor was frightened, but he could not say that even in this moment of
  supreme trial he really hated Christian. He was too big and important for
  such emotions. It would be like hating a tiger to hate Christian. It was as
  easy to expect mercy and tenderness from a wild beast.</p>

  <p>Naylor saw this, at last. He thought of the way he had pulled the man from
  the water of Kendal River. He thought of the way he had nursed him, of the
  dangerous expedition he had made to the town of Blue Water for the sake of
  Barry Christian, of the manner in which, for the sake of Christian, he had
  saved Duff Gregor from the men of Crow's Nest. But all of these services
  would be forgotten if, for an instant, he had come between Christian and the
  hatred which the great outlaw felt for Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>Well, the thing was almost justified. The hate of Christian for Silver had
  made history in the past and it would make history in the future.</p>

  <p>He pondered these things as he was "fanned" for his guns. Then he was
  taken between Cassidy and Pokey to the Townsend ranch.</p>

  <p>Cassidy said, when the gray mustang was saddled: "If he rode all the way
  to Elsinore, last night, he wasn't on this mustang. There ain't enough sweat
  marks on it. Besides, it's still full of ginger!"</p>

  <p>That was true, also, for the inexhaustible meanness of the gray mustang
  induced it to try to pitch off its rider as soon as Naylor got into the
  saddle. He blessed the fierce nature of the gray at that moment!</p>

  <p>They got to the ranch to find that Bill Townsend and his daughter were
  busily stringing wire on the fence posts of the new corral. Townsend worked
  the lever which stretched the wire while his daughter in a workmanlike manner
  whacked home the big brads that fastened the wire to the posts. They stopped
  work to watch the approach of the trio.</p>

  <p>It was Cassidy who spoke first. He touched his hat to the girl and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Townsend. Come over here from the chief. He wants to know if this
  gent here, this fellow Naylor, was really over here chinning with your girl,
  last night from around eleven to one?"</p>

  <p>"Him?" said Townsend. "He sure wasn't. If he was, I'd knock his block off.
  A runt like that make eyes at Sally? I'd tear him in two!"</p>

  <p>The girl said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You hear that?" said Cassidy grimly, to Naylor.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking Cassidy. He was the type to put cold lead in any
  man, with or without orders. Yes, and to enjoy the doing of it, too!</p>

  <p>"I hear," said Naylor. "There's a lot that Townsend doesn't know, maybe.
  That's all I can say."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" said Pokey savagely.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," urged Cassidy.</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"What about this yarn of Naylor coming over here to talk to you for a
  couple of hours last night?"</p>

  <p>"What business is it of yours?" asked the girl angrily.</p>

  <p>Naylor, with a vast relief of spirit, saw that she intended to be as good
  as her word, and lie in his behalf.</p>

  <p>"I gotta make it my business," said Cassidy. "Let's have an
  answer&mdash;if you care enough to get up and talk to this gent for two hours
  by night, you can say two words for him by day."</p>

  <p>"Well, he was here, and what of it?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>Pokey grunted as though it were bad news to him. Cassidy turned his
  deformed face and stared at Naylor.</p>

  <p>"All right, old son," he said. "I guess that lets you out."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute!" shouted Townsend. "Lets him out? It don't let him out at
  all. You mean to say, Naylor, you worthless hound, that you were over here
  last night talking to my girl? Sally, is that right?"</p>

  <p>She said nothing. Townsend charged like a bull, but Naylor spun the gray
  mustang about and fairly fled from the danger. At that, the big hand of
  Townsend clutched for him and barely missed his coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>In the near distance, Naylor pulled up again, and saw Townsend
  gesticulating behind him.</p>

  <p>But the two of the escort were laughing as they came up.</p>

  <p>"That saves your hide, Naylor," said Pokey, as he ranged his horse
  alongside. "You wouldn't blame Christian for being heated up if he thought
  that you had crossed him with Silver, would you?"</p>

  <p>They got back to the camp, and Christian heard the report. He nodded.
  There was no apology for the suspicion he had fixed upon Naylor. He simply
  said:</p>

  <p>"Then if Naylor didn't carry word, somebody else did. Watch yourselves,
  boys, because we have a traitor with us. And when we catch him, he'll wish
  that he'd got to hell in any way except through our hands. However, this is a
  busy day, and the crook will have to wait for to-morrow."</p>

  <p>That was the point at which Bill Naylor made up his mind that he was
  through with Barry Christian and all his men.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; A STROKE OF BAD LUCK</h2>

  <p class="first">THE plan for the train robbery was perfectly simple. Down
  the valley, several miles below Elsinore, the railroad track made a quick
  bend, and at a point where the engineer of the speeding train would not see
  the obstruction until the last available moment, Christian had several trees
  felled right across the rails. There would be just comfortable time, as he
  figured it, for the engineer to clap on the brakes and bring the train to a
  halt after the locomotive rounded the bend into view of the obstacle.</p>

  <p>The place was ideally equipped in every way. For on either side of the way
  there was plenty of tall brush where a thousand men could have hidden, and
  there were several clumps of trees, in two of which the horses were tied.</p>

  <p>Christian had drilled his men carefully in the details of the work.
  Certain ones were to master the engineer and fireman, force them to flood the
  firebox&mdash;so that the train could not proceed on its way for help too
  quickly after the robbery had come to an end.</p>

  <p>Others&mdash;and this was the most important detail, of course&mdash;were
  to make the attack on the mail car, where the safe was located that should
  contain the big shipment of cash. And four men were detailed to take charge
  of the passengers and keep them in the coaches until the fighting was
  finished. Afterward, the passengers could be paraded outside the cars and
  searched for valuables.</p>

  <p>The plan was simple, but of course there was plenty of danger attached to
  it. For one thing, the guards in the treasure car were likely to put up a
  savage fight that might delay the procedure for hours, even. And then in the
  body of the passenger coaches there might be a number of armed men ready to
  battle for their rights. Every Westerner in the train was reasonably sure to
  have a weapon, and to be able to use it. The force of surprise would be half
  the battle to decide the issue in favor of the gang.</p>

  <p>Every man was in his place at least an hour before the time the train was
  due. That hour was the most trying of all. For as Bill Naylor crouched in the
  shade of a bush, shifting here and there as patches of the yellow sunshine
  began to burn through the thickness of his coat like boiling liquid, he
  thought of a number of things that could happen. There was the danger, for
  instance, that the warning might have been given, and that when the train
  arrived, it would consist of coaches filled with keen riflemen who would pour
  out, sweep through the brush, and gather in every last man of the robbers.
  That had happened before in the history of the breaking of law in the West.
  It was not a pleasant prospect.</p>

  <p>There were other troubles to have in mind. And a good big 45-caliber slug
  would put a man on the ground in such shape that Christian, no matter how
  solicitous for the welfare of his men, could not take the wounded away with
  him.</p>

  <p>Well, if a fellow were snagged in that manner, it might mean anything from
  fifteen years to hanging, according as to whether or not any one on the train
  were killed.</p>

  <p>But something more than his own personal danger began to trouble the brain
  of Bill Naylor. The girl had wished one Jim Silver for him to follow rather
  than a thousand like Barry Christian. And though it was true that her father
  kept moonshine liquor and sold horses to robbers, something told Naylor that
  the girl was a different cut from her father. She had to submit to life as
  she found it; but when she started off for herself, there was something
  straight and clean about her eyes that told Naylor she would fight with all
  her might on the side of honesty and the law.</p>

  <p>He looked gloomily around him. Of course, it was far too late to withdraw,
  not only because withdrawal would brand him as a coward, but also because it
  was known that Chirstian never allowed a man to leave the ranks when trouble
  was on hand. Once a follower of Barry Christian, always a follower. That was
  the law of the band. And it seemed to Naylor that he was thinking of another
  man in another era when he remembered the awe and delight with which he had
  at first looked forward to being one of Christian's trusted men.</p>

  <p>Off to the side, Pokey and Cassidy were shaking dice, not for money they
  had in pocket, but for money they expected to have before this day was
  ended.</p>

  <p>Duff Gregor came strolling by slowly. Duff always moved slowly, as though
  he wanted people to mark him with care. Most of the men in the gang had
  little use for him, but every one treated him with a certain amount of
  respectful consideration because of the fact that he had once played the rle
  of the great Jim Silver, and because he was made up to play the same rle
  again. Just what advantage could be gained from that part now it was hard to
  say. But Christian undoubtedly had something important in mind. He was not
  the fellow to waste moves.</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor had had a chance to talk to a number of the men and find out
  from them their exact feelings about Silver. It seemed that they all regarded
  him with a queer mixture of terror and loathing and wonder. The terror and
  wonder were explicable, and the loathing came, it appeared, from their
  feeling that it was unnatural for a man to fight on the side of the law
  unless the law had given him a place, a title, and a respectable salary.
  Amateur bloodhounds were considered savage freaks of nature.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," men said, "that everybody took the same angle that Jim Silver
  does, what sort of a chance would the rest of us have, eh?"</p>

  <p>There was enough in this remark to make Bill Naylor want to smile a
  little. But he realized, also, that as little as a month before he would not
  have smiled at all!</p>

  <p>Naylor was in the midst of these reflections when the first stroke of bad
  luck hit the men of Christian and their plans. On the top of the hills to the
  right of the track appeared the figure of a boy on horseback, without a
  saddle, heading his mustang after a long-legged steer that had, apparently,
  broken loose from the bunch the boy was riding herd on. The youngster was on
  the very verge of cutting off the steer in its flight and sending it back
  when the foolish animal made a sudden turn and bolted right down the steep
  slope toward the railroad.</p>

  <p>The slope was so sharp that the steer, once well under way, had to brace
  itself on all four legs. It bellowed with fear and catapulted to the bottom
  of the grade. There it rolled head over heels, but Western steers are made of
  whalebone and leather, and therefore the neck of this beef was not broken. It
  recovered its feet, shook its head to clear its addled brains, and bolted
  again into the brush which sheltered half of the gang of Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>That would hardly have mattered, but the second half of the little drama
  was what mattered. For the boy, after angling for one moment on the verge of
  the slope, suddenly whipped his mustang right down in pursuit of the steer.
  Considering the shortness of the brown, bare legs that gripped the barrel of
  the horse, and the absence of any stirrups, it was as bold a bit of
  horsemanship as Bill Naylor had ever seen. He saw the boy's face puckered and
  his eyes staring with fear, but down he came, with a ringing whoop to raise
  his own spirits.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the steer, as the boy and the mustang safely caromed to
  the foot of the slope, had flung up its tail and fled, bawling. It seemed so
  blinded by fear that it had not sufficient sense to dodge the brush, but went
  crashing straight through a big bush behind which Pokey and Cassidy were
  playing their game of dice. Pokey leaped up to one side, with a yell.
  Cassidy, knocked sprawling, rose up on the other. Two or three other men
  sprang up from the brush as the course of the steer suddenly threatened
  them.</p>

  <p>That was sufficient to turn the steer; but it was also sufficient to tell
  the boy that a whole band of armed men was hiding out in the shrubbery. That
  was enough for him. He turned the head of his pony away from the steer and
  fled on a straight line for the nearest trees&mdash;and toward Elsinore, far
  away!</p>

  <p>Every one realized the importance of the episode. No youngster able to
  ride like that and take such chances could fail to realize that those armed
  men had not gathered together merely to sit in the shade and waste their
  time. He would probably go right on to Elsinore as fast as his swift little
  mustang could carry him.</p>

  <p>"Stop him!" shouted the great voice of Christian as he rose. "Shoot the
  horse from under him!"</p>

  <p>Shoot the horse from under him? Who in the world could determine his
  shooting so exactly as to be sure of striking the horse, and not the boy, as
  the pair scuttled away behind their own dust cloud?</p>

  <p>Apparently Christian was ready to trust his own hand and eye.</p>

  <p>"Give me that rifle," he said. "I'll do the job myself! Here!"</p>

  <p>And there he stood, settling the rifle to his shoulder.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Bill Naylor that he could see again the puckered face of the
  boy, frightened, fighting against fear and conquering it. He leaped up and
  knocked the rifle of Chirstian off the bead that had just been drawn.</p>

  <p>"Don't chance it chief!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Christian whirled on him with the face of an ugly devil. He drove the butt
  of the gun against Naylor's head hard enough to fling him flat on his back.
  As he lay there, gradually pushing himself on his elbows, he heard the hammer
  of the rifle fall with a dull click. The gun had misfired, and far away the
  boy had passed behind the screen of a grove of trees.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; SUSPECT</h2>

  <p class="first">SOME one shouted that they must run the boy down. Christian
  hurried off to the side with another rifle, hoping to get another shot at the
  target, but the youngster did not appear again except for an instant as he
  rounded the shoulder of a hill half a mile away and was quickly out of view
  again.</p>

  <p>Five men were on fast horses, only waiting the signal before they spurred
  away, but Christian said to them calmly:</p>

  <p>"No use, boys. That boy weighs only a feather, and by the way the legs of
  that mustang twinkled, it's a little speedster. We've simply had a break of
  bad luck."</p>

  <p>He turned toward Bill Naylor, who was gradually picking himself up from
  the ground.</p>

  <p>"At least," said Christian, "bad luck is what we can call it for the time
  being."</p>

  <p>His voice was perfectly quiet. His eyes were still and calm, also. But it
  was the brightness of a steel point that was glittering deep in them. There
  was not the least alteration of feature in the man, and yet Naylor knew that
  he was ready to drink hot blood.</p>

  <p>"Seemed to me a risky thing, chief," said Naylor, holding his injured
  head. "I didn't see how even you could shoot at that pair without chancing
  hitting the kid."</p>

  <p>"And suppose I had?" demanded Christian. "Suppose that I had hit the boy?
  What of it?"</p>

  <p>Naylor said nothing. He had a perfectly definite impression that if he had
  uttered a word, no matter what, he would be murdered on the spot.</p>

  <p>Christian said to him softly: "I've owed you several things. They're wiped
  out. We start level again, Naylor, unless you did get the word to Jim Silver
  last night."</p>

  <p>He meant it. There was no doubt about that. If ever Christian had even a
  fair suspicion that Naylor had carried that warning to Jim Silver, there
  would be death, there would be a death more hideous than fire for the
  traitor.</p>

  <p>Christian had turned from Naylor to the others, and he was saying:</p>

  <p>"Boys, this is a bit of hard luck. But the game isn't finished. It's
  several miles from here to Elsinore. Ordinarily it would require a good bit
  of time, in a town like that, to get together a posse to come out after a
  crowd like ours. But these are not ordinary times. You can see, now, why I
  wanted to get rid of Jim Silver last night.</p>

  <p>"He's back there in Elsinore, unless some kind devil moved him to leave
  the place to-day. He's there in Elsinore, and the instant the news is brought
  in by that lad riding horseback, Jim Silver will know what's up. He'll have a
  crowd together inside of three minutes, and be pelting out here to get at us.
  There's only one thing in our favor, and that is that the train is due in ten
  minutes. If everything works smoothly, we'll be able to put the deal through
  before any interference comes this way from Elsinore and Jim Silver. Get back
  to your places and wait!"</p>

  <p>They went back solemnly.</p>

  <p>Pokey paused beside Naylor and looked him curiously in the eye.</p>

  <p>"How'd you like it?" asked Pokey, and then, grinning, he sauntered on his
  way.</p>

  <p>The whole band would turn against Naylor now. He had been too high in the
  favor of the chief before. He was too low in that favor now.</p>

  <p>He sat down, muttering savagely to himself. He had been right, he knew, in
  disturbing the aim of the chief. He was glad that he had done it. Other
  people would be glad to know that he had been man enough to interfere even
  with terrible Barry Christian for such a purpose as that. Sally Townsend
  would be glad. Jim Silver would be glad, too.</p>

  <p>As for the personal indignity, he hardly felt it, for he would never have
  dreamed of comparing himself with the bright glory of Barry Christian. But it
  seemed to Bill Naylor, as the minutes passed, that he was being carried on
  wings far away, and far away from the whole purpose of his old life, in which
  Christian had been a hero.</p>

  <p>Some one was calling in a rather hushed voice: "The train's already ten
  minutes overdue, chief. If we wanta have space between us and Jim Silver,
  hadn't we better start making tracks now?"</p>

  <p>Barry Christian stood up. He said:</p>

  <p>"Boys, every one of you can do as he pleases. I don't want any one of you
  to stay here with me unless he wants to&mdash;except Bill Naylor. The rest of
  you are perfectly free to run and save your scalps. If I'm left alone, I'm
  going ahead with this job, anyway, and if Jim Silver comes up in the middle
  of it, we'll simply try to show him that bullets can cut through his flesh as
  easily as they cut through ours!"</p>

  <p>It was a good talk, delivered with the right sort of a ring in the last
  words. It was greeted with a faint cheer, and Naylor knew that not a man of
  the lot would actually withdraw. That was what proper leadership meant. He
  wondered what this same Barry Christian could accomplish if he had behind him
  an army of honest men, and himself could fight with an honest purpose?</p>

  <p>There was something else for Naylor to think of, and that was the entire
  attitude of Barry Christian toward him. He was now suspect, which meant that
  to-morrow he might be dead.</p>

  <p>He was still in the midst of these broodings when some one called:</p>

  <p>"I hear it! I hear it comin out of the ground!"</p>

  <p>There was something ghostly in that announcement&mdash;all the bright heat
  of the sun could not remove the suggestion of a spirit transpiring from the
  solid earth. But then, with his own ears, Naylor heard the faint and distant
  humming of the heavy iron wheels on the rails.</p>

  <p>"All right, boys," Christian said. "The thing is going through like a
  song. Remember, I'm going to crack that safe if I have to do it with my hands
  and my teeth. There's several hundred thousand dollars waiting for us.
  Everybody steady. Everybody cool. Think of the scare we'll be throwing into
  the poor devils in that train&mdash;and don't shoot at a man until you see
  him flash a gun! A few rounds in the air as we close in, that's all!"</p>

  <p>Bill Naylor repeated his own part to himself. He was to get close to the
  cab of the locomotive as soon as possible and cover the engineer and fireman.
  Cassidy, on the other side of the track, would be busy with the same task.
  They were the foremost of the gang stationed to get at the head of the train.
  Though it seemed to Naylor, as he looked down the rails, that sanded tracks
  and heavy brakes would surely bring the train to a halt much more quickly
  than had been anticipated after the engine rounded the curve of the
  valley.</p>

  <p>In that case, might not the engineer be able to throw the gears into
  reverse and back the huge weight of the train away from the danger spot? Once
  under way, it would be an easy matter for the armed men in the train to keep
  off three times as many horsemen as Christian could offer for the battle.</p>

  <p>These were the doubts that rose in the mind of Naylor as the sound of
  humming increased along the rails and then the distinct noise of the engine
  was heard. But he had prefigured a sort of heavy thundering of steam exhaust
  and laboring metal, such as a big train makes when it pulls up under the
  hollow of a vault of a station house, and he was amazed and taken by surprise
  when the engine suddenly poked its nose around the bend and came grandly
  on.</p>

  <p>It looked as tall as a tree, and from its stubby smokestack a column of
  smoke shot swiftly back, expanding, spreading out in a flowing cloud like a
  half-divided head of hair. Then the engineer seemed to see the obstacle that
  crossed the tracks. There was a wild hooting of the whistle, and the brakes
  screamed, and the wheels skidded with a terrible vibration on the tracks.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; THE TRAIN ROBBERY</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL NAYLOR looked right and left toward the hooded figures.
  They were not simply equipped with face masks. Barry Christian always
  insisted that his men wear hoods that completely covered the head. Otherwise
  telltale features such as hair and ears could usually be glimpsed and serve
  as bases of identification in case of arrest. Naylor himself was wearing such
  a mask. He wished now that he had made the eye holes even smaller. It was
  better to endanger his own accuracy of vision a little rather than to expose
  too much of his face.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the train rumbled nearer. It came to a shuddering halt
  with the engine exactly in front of Naylor, and he sprang suddenly to his
  feet with a yell and fired a rifle bullet into the sky. That was the arranged
  signal. He felt, as he saw the train halt right in front of him, that the
  robbery could not fail to go through perfectly. The skill with which Barry
  Christian had estimated the distance the engine must cover before the brakes
  brought it to a halt offered an assurance that all the rest of the scheme
  would go through smoothly.</p>

  <p>All down the line of the train, in answer to his signal shot, he heard an
  outbreak of shooting and yelling. Frightened faces looked out the windows of
  the coaches. But just before him he had his main concern. There was a
  gray-headed, red-faced hulk of an engineer in the cab of the locomotive. He
  had leaned from view and reappeared again with a big revolver in his hand.
  Bill Naylor, his bead already drawn, merely snipped the cap off the
  engineer's head.</p>

  <p>"Drop that gun, you fool, or I'll brain you with the next shot!" he
  shouted.</p>

  <p>The engineer, his hair tousled and on end, looked woefully down at the big
  Colt which was in his hand. At last he threw it out on the ground with a
  curse. Across the cab, Naylor could see the fireman with his arms stiffly
  extended above his head. That meant that Cassidy was doing his share of the
  work.</p>

  <p>In the distance he heard a voice shouting: "Open the door or we'll blow
  the car off the track, and you with it!"</p>

  <p>That would be the mail coach which the robbers were threatening. But his
  own task was merely to see that the engineer was made helpless, together with
  the fireman, and that the fire box of the engine was thoroughly flooded. He
  told Cassidy to take the fireman down on his side of the engine. Then,
  climbing into the cab, he put his rifle aside and laid the muzzle of a
  revolver against the chest of the old engineer. He sat in the cab with his
  head fallen, his greasy hands weak, idle, palms up in his lap.</p>

  <p>At Naylor's command to flood the fire box, he returned with a vacant
  stare:</p>

  <p>"I dropped my gun like a dirty yellow coward&mdash;but I'll not lift a
  finger to kill this engine."</p>

  <p>Naylor felt a sudden touch of pity.</p>

  <p>"You're not disgraced," he said. "You got no chance. That's all. Buck up
  and do what I tell you!"</p>

  <p>But there was no use arguing. The engineer seemed actually to prefer
  shooting to obeying orders from robbers. Cassidy had to get the fireman to do
  the job, and as the flood of cold water hit the raging furnace of the
  firebox, it exploded into steam that rushed out in enormous clouds with
  whistlings and rumblings. The cloud enveloped the whole locomotive and the
  head of the train, while voices of alarm yelled to cut down the fog.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Cassidy and Naylor tied the engineer and fireman back to
  back and elbow to elbow, which is about the best way of quickly making two
  men harmless, because every struggle of the one is sure to hurt the
  other.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of action for Naylor to see as he walked back down the
  length of the train.</p>

  <p>The passengers were making enough noise to furnish out a whole battle
  scene, but what mattered was the attack on the mail coach. The guards had
  failed to open the doors, and as Naylor left the engine and started back, a
  petard which Christian had affixed to the door of the mail coach exploded and
  smashed the lock. The door itself was instantly opened, and from within two
  repeating rifles opened a rapid fire.</p>

  <p>The very first shot caught Dick Penny, of the Christian gang, full in the
  chest. He spread out his arms and walked with short steps across the tracks
  as though he were a performer on a tight rope striving to get his balance. He
  sat down against the fence and pulled off his hood in order to get more air.
  His whole chest was covered with red that began to leap down into his
  lap.</p>

  <p>Naylor, taking shelter close to the side of the train, saw that picture.
  Then he was aware of a figure climbing apelike up the end of the mail coach
  and running along the top of it.</p>

  <p>That was Barry Christian. No hood could conceal the dimensions of his big
  shoulders. And what other man, unless it were Jim Silver, could combine such
  massive weight and strength with such catlike agility?</p>

  <p>When he was just over the open door, Christian got a toe hold on a
  ventilator in the roof and drooped his body over the edge of the car. In that
  way his head and shoulders swung down suddenly over the open door.</p>

  <p>It was a maneuver so daring that it seemed suicidal, but in each of
  Christian's hands there was a revolver. He fired three or four times as fast
  as he could. Then he pulled himself back to the roof of the car.</p>

  <p>The rifle fire inside the car had stopped.</p>

  <p>"Go get 'em boys! They're done for!" shouted Christian.</p>

  <p>The last of his words were blurred by a horrible screaming that began
  inside the mail coach. It made Naylor want to close his eyes and stop his
  ears, like a child or a foolish woman. He had never heard in his life a sound
  that was quite so frightful.</p>

  <p>Big Duff Gregor, now that the rifle fire was silenced, was the first into
  the mail coach, with two others behind him. They pulled out two badly wounded
  men. They were carried over to the fence beside the railroad where Dick Penny
  was already sitting, and a yell from Christian told Naylor to guard them. It
  struck Naylor like a bullet&mdash;to hear his own name shouted out like that
  in the hearing of so many witnesses. Why should he be identified out of the
  entire crowd?</p>

  <p>However, he had his hands full of work.</p>

  <p>One of the guards had been shot through the body. He looked greenish
  white, he was so sick from his wound. He never made a sound of pain, but he
  kept saying in a weak voice:</p>

  <p>"Quit the yelling, Charlie! Quit the noise!"</p>

  <p>Charlie was not fatally hurt, in spite of his screeching. He had a clean
  bullet wound in his left leg, but what tortured him was the smashing of his
  right hand. A slug of lead from Christian's gun had drilled right through the
  center of the hand, tearing to pieces all the delicate nerves of the palm. He
  kept holding the hand by the wrist. He would be silent for a few seconds,
  bending his body forward and back like a pendulum, and then the scream of
  agony would jerk his head back and distort his mouth.</p>

  <p>Every time he yelled, Naylor felt the sound go through him like a
  sword&mdash;a red, flaming sword that filled his brain with smoke.</p>

  <p>He fell to work as fast as he could to bandage up the-wounds. Cassidy was
  there, too, not being definitely assigned to any other task. He took charge
  of Dick Penny. Out of the corner of his eye, Naylor was aware that the
  passengers were filing out of the train and lining up in a long, straight row
  beside the coaches.</p>

  <p>It was a long train, and it was crowded. Three women had fainted. They
  were carried out by other passengers and laid in the shadow beside the train.
  Up forward, the steam was still gushing with a fainter hissing from the
  flooded fire box, and now and then wisp of the thin mist were blown back
  across the passengers. Duff Gregor was starting down the line of them,
  searching them thoroughly, and dropping everything he got&mdash;jewelry,
  watches, wallets&mdash;into a canvas sack.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, of course, Barry Christian and his chosen assistants were
  working on the blowing of the safe in the mail coach. They must be working
  with set teeth and hasty fingers, struggling against time, and in their
  minds, constantly, the image of Jim Silver rushing across the hills on
  Parade, with his followers streaming out behind him.</p>

  <p>But all of these things were in the background of Naylor's mind. What
  immediately focused his attention was the screeching of the man named
  Charlie, and the doings of the other two wounded men. The guard who had been
  shot through the body was so sick and weak that he had slumped down on his
  back. He shook his head when Naylor offered him a drink of whisky from a
  flask.</p>

  <p>"Just stop Charlie from screaming, will you?" he pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I'm tryin' to stop, Mike," gasped Charlie. "But I can't! I'm tryin'
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And again the horrible outcry tore his throat.</p>

  <p>Over on the left, Cassidy stopped trying to work for the comfort of Dick
  Penny. He wanted to make Penny lie down, but Dick refused. He was only
  nineteen, a stringy, blond-headed, cheerful youth with a string of killings
  chalked up to his credit.</p>

  <p>"I'll take mine sitting up," he said. "If you don't stop that blankety
  fool from yelling, I'll shoot the other hand off him. Gimme a drink,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>Naylor handed him the flask. Penny could not manage it with one shaking
  hand, but he succeeded by using two in getting the bottle to his lips. He
  took a long swig.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could get the whisky into me as fast as the blood is running
  out," said Dick Penny. "That'd be a fair exchange. Here's to you, Bill!"</p>

  <p>He drank again. He began to laugh, but the pain which the laughter caused
  to him cut it short.</p>

  <p>Then he said&mdash;and Naylor never forgot it&mdash;"How dark it is, and
  not a star!"</p>

  <p>Cassidy had the soul of a rattlesnake, but this speech had moved him.</p>

  <p>"You're goin' to be all right, kid," he said.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool," answered Dick Penny. "I know what kind of a darkness
  this is. I know what kind of a night it is that's shutting in on me. I ain't
  going to wake up from this sleep. Gimme another flask, somebody. There ain't
  anything in this bottle."</p>

  <p>There was no other flask at hand. Naylor said to Charlie:</p>

  <p>"Can you shut up for a minute? My partner here is passing out."</p>

  <p>Charlie bit a scream in two and swallowed the inside half of it. The other
  wounded guard turned his head toward Dick Penny and watched with eyes that
  were suddenly bright.</p>

  <p>Penny said, "Help me stand up, boys."</p>

  <p>"Sit still, Dick. You ain't fit to stand up."</p>

  <p>Penny cursed him with a burst of language, saying: "I ain't goin' to sit
  down. I'm goin' to stand up to it."</p>

  <p>Naylor understood what was in his mind, and, grabbing him under the
  armpits, lifted him to his feet. He supported him. Penny's head flopped over
  to the side, and his sombrero fell off.</p>

  <p>"Put my hat back on my head," said Penny.</p>

  <p>Cassidy lifted the hat, actually dusted it, and then settled it carefully
  on the head of Penny. The blood was running rapidly down to the feet of
  Penny. He was a crimson figure.</p>

  <p>"All right, Bill. Let go of me," directed Penny.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Dick?" asked Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, and do what I tell you to do, will you?" commanded Penny.</p>

  <p>Naylor gingerly released his grasp. He expected Dick Penny to fall flat,
  but instead, Penny supported himself on sagging knees. He turned, staggering,
  toward the others.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm watching," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"You tell the others," said Dick Penny in a voice suddenly clear and loud,
  "that I took it standing. I didn't lie down to it, and I didn't sit down to
  it. I took it&mdash;standing!"</p>

  <p>His voice held out right to the end of his words. Then he crumpled up.</p>

  <p>Naylor grabbed for him, but the loose weight slid through his hands to the
  ground. He looked down and saw the half-open eyes of Penny, and a small,
  sneering smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>He knew very well before he fumbled at the heart of Dick that he was
  dead.</p>

  <p>Then he heard Mike, the guard, saying: "That was pretty good. That's the
  best I ever seen. That's nerve, is what it is."</p>

  <p>Right on the heels of that came an explosion that made the mail coach
  rock, and a thin cloud of smoke puffed far out through the open doors.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; RIDERS FROM TOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTIAN was first through the doors of the mail coach
  again. His shout of triumph told Naylor everything that he needed to know.
  The safe had been cracked, and the rest of this business would soon be
  finished. But where was Jim Silver, and where were the men from Elsinore that
  the boy on the fast-galloping mustang must have roused long before this?</p>

  <p>A horse was brought up to the side of the mail coach, and Christian and
  the other men inside the car began to hand out hastily filled small
  saddlebags which were rapidly tied onto the horse. The thing was ended in
  another minute. Christian jumped down and whistled three quick notes.</p>

  <p>"Fall in! Fall in!" he called in his great voice.</p>

  <p>If any of the passengers on the train had ever heard that voice before,
  how could they fail to recognize now the powerful, ringing notes of it?</p>

  <p>There was a quick scampering. The passengers had been disarmed, of course,
  as they were searched, and there was little danger that they would open fire
  as the retreat began. All that happened as the outlaws rushed to their horses
  was that one of the women who had fainted sat up suddenly and broke into
  hysterical laughter. She was a big, fat woman, and she laughed so
  convulsively that her hat jerked off her head and her gray hair tumbled down
  over her shoulders. She kept on laughing, on a higher and a higher note. It
  was strange the distance at which that laughter still followed in the ears of
  Naylor as he rode away with the rest of the gang.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him a mockery of all that had been accomplished on this
  day.</p>

  <p>Cassidy rode up beside him as he took off his hood.</p>

  <p>"They say there's more than the three hundred and fifty thousand. They say
  there's nearly half a million taken out of that safe!" said Cassidy. "It
  takes Barry Christian to plan a scoop and then make it."</p>

  <p>Naylor heard the words, but the meaning did not register deeply in his
  mind. Nothing mattered very much to him except the picture of how Dick Penny
  had stood up to die. As for the money&mdash;well, money cannot teach a man
  how to die. It can't do much of anything for you. You can't eat gold. And as
  for enough clothes to stand up in and enough food to eat&mdash;well, any fool
  can get those things by working honestly with the hands.</p>

  <p>Who need be afraid of work?</p>

  <p>He kept thinking along those lines while he jogged his horse in the middle
  of the crowd.</p>

  <p>"That fellow Mike," he said to Cassidy. "Think that he'll pull
  through?"</p>

  <p>"I saw where the bullet socked him and where it came out. He's got a good
  chance," said Cassidy. "But what d'you care?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Naylor, "it just makes the difference between robbery and
  murder."</p>

  <p>Cassidy stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Are you weakening, Naylor?" he demanded harshly.</p>

  <p>And suddenly he reined his horse away, as though he were too disgusted by
  the last remark to remain any longer in the company of the man who had made
  it.</p>

  <p>They got out of the narrows of the valley and onto the rolling uplands
  beyond, with Barry Christian keeping the pace down to a steady trot. That
  pace would conserve the strength of the horses, and if a posse from Elsinore
  came at them, probably the men from the latter town would have ridden most of
  the wind out of their mounts before they came in sight. But what man, other
  than Barry Christian, would have had the nerve to keep to such a moderate
  gait instead of trying to speed away for shelter among the higher
  mountains?</p>

  <p>Gravely and bitterly, Naylor admired the outlaw chief. And yet, even at
  this minute he hardly regretted that he was no longer one of Christian's
  tried and chosen few. He was back in the ruck, part of the rank and the file.
  He noticed, too, that Christian was not leading the horse that carried the
  treasure. Instead, the horse was being conducted by Duff Gregor, whose fine
  thoroughbred chestnut stallion, stained to resemble Parade, was dancing
  lightly over the ground.</p>

  <p>They had gone so far from the scene of the robbery that it seemed to
  Naylor that the late affair was sifting down into his past, joining many old
  memories that were dim under the sea of time, when the voice of Cassidy
  yelled:</p>

  <p>"They're coming! They're coming!"</p>

  <p>He looked back, and through a cleft among the hills behind them Naylor saw
  a slowly rising cloud of dust. It streamed toward them. He could make out
  little figures that moved under the cloud of the dust.</p>

  <p>There was an irregular checking and spurring of horses. Then the calm
  voice of Barry Christian called:</p>

  <p>"All right, boys. This is what we expected. Every man steady, now. Get the
  horses into a lope and keep 'em there. I've got a half-million-dollar flag
  here, and I know I can trust you fellows to rally around it!"</p>

  <p>Of course, that was true, and a very neat effect it made to see that horse
  which was burdened with nothing but the stolen treasure. Not a man was apt to
  fall away from the party before receiving his split of the loot.</p>

  <p>They went off steadily enough, riding at the lope, the pace for which was
  set by Barry Christian. And, looking over his little band, Naylor remembered
  the evening not so many weeks before when he had smoked at the side of the
  Kendal Falls and had seen the body of the drowning man swept headlong down
  the current. Then, by a gesture&mdash;rather, by the lack of a gesture-he
  could have prevented all of this. He could have let Barry Christian pass on
  to the doom he deserved. Instead, he had chosen to pull him back to safety,
  and so he had managed to undo how much of the good work of Jim Silver?</p>

  <p>Conscience was not a keenly developed portion of the soul of Naylor, but
  something like it was being tormented now!</p>

  <p>They kept on at the steady pace until they had risen well up on a higher
  tide of hills, and at that point Christian fell to the rear and ordered the
  others to continue steadily toward a point which he had marked out.</p>

  <p>Then, taking up his post on the brow of the hill, Christian drew out a
  strong field glass and peered down at the lower ground over which the pursuit
  was sweeping. He remained for some time conducting his examination. In the
  meantime, as the fleeing riders climbed a still higher slope, Bill Naylor in
  turn twisted in the saddle, let his horse go a little distance at a walk, and
  peered with straining eyes at the lower plain.</p>

  <p>The pursuers were far closer than they had been a little time before. They
  came on with a determined rush, and the size of the dust cloud seemed to
  indicate more than a hundred riders in the lot. That, however, was too large
  a guess, for as a gust of wind cleared the dust suddenly away, Naylor was
  able to estimate the situation at a glance.</p>

  <p>There were fully fifty men riding to the front, more or less stretched out
  in a loose formation, according to the strength of their mustangs and their
  skill as riders. And, a little distance behind them, held in a close herd by
  several other riders, appeared a sweeping mass of perhaps threescore
  unsaddled horses.</p>

  <p>Fear that had remained far back in the mind of Naylor until this moment,
  now suddenly leaped up right into his throat. With so many remounts, the men
  of Elsinore would surely have an excellent chance of riding down Christian's
  party. But, more than all else, to make the picture significant, there was
  sight of a man in the lead of all the rest, and the horse he rode on flashed
  like gold, even from the distance.</p>

  <p>That was Jim Silver and Parade.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; CHRISTIAN'S SCHEME</h2>

  <p class="first">THE news which Barry Christian now carried up to the party,
  riding at a sweeping gallop, was already clear in the mind of Naylor, of
  course; but he wondered vaguely how the chief would communicate the bad
  tidings. Surely he would hardly dare to reveal the worst! But perhaps others,
  though they had not lingered behind like Naylor, might have seen the dust
  cloud lift.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Christian, rising in his stirrups, shouted in a loud
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Boys, Jim Silver and the Elsinore men are coming like wild Indians.
  They've got a whole drove of remounts with them, and they're going to run us
  down before the day's over."</p>

  <p>He made a pause. Cassidy's snarling, barking voice called in answer:</p>

  <p>"Split up the loot now and we'll all scatter!"</p>

  <p>"Is there time to split up the loot?" demanded Christian. "Before we can
  sort that stuff Silver will be right on top of us. No, we've got to stick
  together. But I have an idea of a way to beat them still. Boys, we're going
  to head straight for Benton Corner!"</p>

  <p>A shout of dismay and confused doubt answered this suggestion. But
  Christian went on:</p>

  <p>"We've got the double of Jim Silver with us, and I know how we can use
  him. Friends, we'll go right into Benton Corner. On the way there, some of
  you sling an arm; some more of you get a bandage tied around your heads or
  legs. A few little spots of blood here and there will make it look as though
  we've been under fire sure enough. When we get into Benton Corner, Duff
  Gregor will shout out the news that Barry Christian is on the loose again,
  that he's raised a mob of fifty men, that he's heading straight for Benton
  Corner to shoot up the town, that he&mdash;Jim Silver&mdash;has tried to stop
  the rush and failed. He'll call for volunteers to go out and meet the men of
  Barry Christian.</p>

  <p>"You understand? When the Benton Corner men hear that, they'll turn out,
  every soul of 'em, and while they ride back to smash the charge, the rest of
  us will slip away through the town, scattering right and left through the
  alleys and the lanes. We'll come out and rejoin on the farther side.
  Understand? And we'll leave the Benton Corner and the Elsinore men fighting
  like fools too far away from one another to make out the truth!"</p>

  <p>It took a moment for the details of the plan to penetrate the minds of the
  outlaws. But when they realized, they raised for big Barry Christian only
  such a shout as despairing men can lift in honor of a chief who promises them
  their lives. They yelled. They stood up in their stirrups and swung their
  hats and cheered for Christian. And Duff Gregor galloped to the side of Barry
  Christian to receive the final instructions before the town of Benton Corner
  was reached.</p>

  <p>It was a neat idea. It might very well work, unless there happened to be
  in Benton Corner men cool-headed enough to realize that Jim Silver&mdash;the
  real Jim Silver-was hardly the sort of fellow to retire at a gallop even in
  the face of danger of odds of four to one. Unless, also, there happened to be
  some one who knew intimately the face of Silver and the figure of the great
  Parade.</p>

  <p>What a man was Barry Christian! No wonder that the cream of the criminal
  brains of the West was eager to follow him wherever he might lead.</p>

  <p>Then the thought of Naylor turned back to Jim Silver, riding with the men
  of Elsinore on behalf of the law. No doubt, close to him rode that slender
  panther of a man with the pale, bright eyes&mdash;Taxi. Those two alone might
  be strong enough to wreck all the forces of the great Christian. It seemed to
  Naylor a battle of supermen&mdash;and he was a useless force in the
  encounter.</p>

  <p>They turned straight for the town of Benton Corner, and as they journeyed
  through the heightening hills, the dust cloud behind them crept closer and
  closer, now working up to them with a continual sweep which made it clear
  that Silver had mounted his men on the reserve horses, and that he had
  determined to have the hounds of the law on the traces of the desperadoes
  before long.</p>

  <p>No doubt he had not even stopped to make inquiries at the train that had
  been robbed. In the distance he would be able to see the big train standing
  with no smoke yet rising out of the stack. That sight, near the spot which
  the boy must have reported, would have been enough to tell him what had
  happened&mdash;that, and the gradually diminishing head of a cloud of dust in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>Benton Corner, that must be the salvation of the fugitives, now heaved
  into view, perched between two hills, with the upper mountains just beyond
  it, and with the eternal smoke of the great smelter rising above it in an
  entangling mist that seemed to keep the little town drab and gray even in the
  midst of this beautiful weather.</p>

  <p>There was not much wastage of paint in Benton Corner. It was a workaday
  town, and the houses in it were the color of decaying, weather-rotted canvas.
  There were no trees rising over it. There was no sense of pleasure in life
  when it was viewed from a distance or close up. Into Benton Corner swept the
  rout of the Barry Christian gang.</p>

  <p>The orders of Barry Christian himself had been put into execution
  faithfully. There appeared three men with bloodstained bandages around their
  heads. Two others carried one arm in a sling. There was a leg bandage here
  and there&mdash;and always there was the spot of red blood.</p>

  <p>A desperate appearance they presented as they galloped through the streets
  of the town.</p>

  <p>Here Duff Gregor became suddenly the most important man of the lot. Barry
  Christian himself had a face almost covered by a great bandage that must
  suggest itself to some observers as being useful as a mask as well as a
  protection to an injury. And Duff Gregor, his part already well rehearsed,
  and his brain crammed with words learned from Barry Christian, galloped
  before the rest on that beautiful, commanding figure of the chestnut
  thoroughbred.</p>

  <p>As he went he shouted loudly, drawing rein a little. Behind him came the
  bandaged, the sweating, dusty, grim band of fighters. And as he galloped,
  Duff Gregor was yelling.</p>

  <p>"Barry Christian's come back to life! Barry Christians on the go! He's
  back there with fifty desperadoes. Any fighting men in Benton Corner?"</p>

  <p>Any fighting men in Benton Corner? Well, there were no other sort of men
  in the town, truth to tell. And they swarmed out from lodging houses, from
  saloons. They broke up the groups which they had formed at corners, idling,
  and they bolted for their horses. At every hitch rack stood tough mustangs,
  saddled and ready for action, and here and there in groups there were men
  tougher than the horseflesh they used. No man had to wait to get a gun.
  Weapons they carried under their coats or belted around their thighs, or else
  they had long-barreled repeating Winchesters thrust deep in the saddle
  holsters, waiting to be used.</p>

  <p>Fighting men in Benton Corner? Why, the whole town rose up, shouting, and
  started a dust cloud rolling out toward the direction from which, according
  to Duff Gregor, the danger was sweeping toward the town.</p>

  <p>What amazed Bill Naylor most of all was the devotion, the veritable joy of
  these men when they saw that made-up figure of Duff Gregor and cheered him
  under the name of Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>That name was always, on all sides, beating through the air. "Silver!"
  "Silver!" "Parade!" "Jim Silver and Parade!" they yelled as Duff Gregor went
  by, never pausing long, and always shouting out his warning, and then dashing
  on before men had a full chance to center their eyes on him and criticize the
  truth of his appearance.</p>

  <p>There was one great fault in the performance&mdash;Jim Silver, the real
  Jim Silver, would hardly come plunging into a town like this, shouting for
  help, but&mdash;well, what Westerner would be critical? The very name of Jim
  Silver was enough to put all criticism to sleep and leave, in the place of
  logical, reasoning brains, a frenzy of hope and courage and excitement.</p>

  <p>Benton Corner sent out its men like a cloud of dust that winged off
  through the hills to find the bloodthirsty followers of "Barry Christian."
  And this false "Jim Silver," who was expected, of course, to turn behind the
  recruits and rally the forces of battle outside the town?</p>

  <p>Well, that "Jim Silver," like the rest of the rascals who were with him,
  turned aside and sneaked down a side street after he had seen the rush of
  fighting men start for the scene of conflict. Down alleys and by lanes they
  rode. One small boy, as Naylor would never forget, ran out in front yard and
  yelled at him: "That's the wrong way! Jim Silver wants you back there! Back
  there!"</p>

  <p>Naylor jogged his mustang on its way. And the boy ran out into the street
  behind him and screamed:</p>

  <p>"Coward! Coward! Jim Silver wants you!"</p>

  <p>What a man, thought Naylor, if he could put himself inside the minds of
  the boys of the community in this fashion!</p>

  <p>But, after all, the youngster was right. That was where all the honest and
  brave men belonged&mdash;back there, helping Jim Silver, among the hills.</p>

  <p>Before Naylor came out on the farther side of Benton Corner he could hear
  the distant sound of rifle fire from the other side of the town. And he knew
  that they were at it. Honest men against honest men, shooting to kill, one
  side led by the invincible name of the great Jim Silver, and the other side
  led by Jim Silver himself!</p>

  <p>What a thing it was to divide a man against himself and use his famous
  reputation to destroy him, as Barry Christian was using Jim Silver now!</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the other members of the gang had come sifting through
  the town. They were gathering together again, in a string, as a wedge of
  ducks might be scattered by gunfire when they fly near the ground, but reform
  again in the sky, after a short distance. That was what had happened with the
  Christian outfit. Here they were again, at the mouth of a great ravine that
  cleaved through the mountains as though they had been ripped apart by a
  gigantic plow.</p>

  <p>Every man of them had reassembled, except Dick Penny. He was gone forever
  to another sort of a meeting, and another sort of a meeting place; there were
  only twelve men, counting the great Christian himself, who entered the mouth
  of the ravine in a group&mdash;and one of them was leading the treasure
  horse!</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible! They could not, ordinarily, have dared to come close
  to any town, fugitives as they were from justice. Only the brilliance of
  Barry Christian had enabled them not only to pass through the town in safety,
  but to make of the law-abiding men in Benton Corner a filter through which
  what dangers could flow toward them?</p>

  <p>Far in the distance they heard the faint clattering of the rifle fire only
  gradually dying away!</p>

  <p>It seemed to Naylor that the back of Barry Christian was a little
  straighter. Certainly he had proved as almost never before in his famous
  career what a right he had to be called a lord of men. All his men were
  laughing, and they were slapping on the back Duff Gregor, who had just saved
  their hides! He was laughing most of all, that Judas whose life had been
  spared by the mercy of the great, the true, the honest Jim Silver!</p>

  <p>Near the mouth of the ravine, the party halted at a place where a fresh
  spring bubbled sparkling out of the ground and ran brimful a little crater of
  rock. The big mountains shoved their naked heads up into the sky upon all
  sides. There was not a tree in sight.</p>

  <p>There they halted, loosened the cinches of the horses, let them dip in
  their heads almost to the eyes to drink of the pure water. They sloshed water
  over the legs of the animals. At the direction of Barry Christian they led
  them up and down and gave them a good breathing spell.</p>

  <p>For Christian pointed out that they had only won one lap in the
  race&mdash;unless by the fortune of war a bullet had happened to tag Jim
  Silver.</p>

  <p>He even kept one man posted at the mouth of the ravine to give warning in
  case any one of a suspicious nature should advance toward them during the
  rest period.</p>

  <p>It was a very jovial pause. Every one of the men, with a single exception,
  seemed as light hearted as a cricket. For when had criminals before this day
  ever managed to make the men of the law fight one another for the sake of a
  band of plunderers?</p>

  <p>The one exception was Bill Naylor, and as he stood with gloomy head,
  watching his gray mustang, he suddenly looked up and felt the cold, bright
  eyes of Barry Christian fixed upon him.</p>

  <p>With a shudder, Naylor looked away, for he felt that the cold, bright
  thrust of that glance had found his heart and opened up all the dark secrets
  of it.</p>

  <p>Then, amazing them all, the guard who had been posted at the mouth of the
  ravine ran back, shouting:</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver! Jim Silver! He's coming, with half a dozen men behind him!
  Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>The name rang magically on the ear of Naylor. He looked at Christian, and
  for the first time he saw the face of the great outlaw blanch. Was it
  surprise or fear that had unnerved him?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; THE TRAP</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was reason enough for Christian to be dismayed. What
  had happened? How had Silver managed to disentangle himself from the fight on
  the farther side of the town? How had he managed to sift through so quickly
  with a chosen band of the pursuers?</p>

  <p>Then Christian came to himself and said calmly: "Boys, this puts the crown
  on everything. Scatter back on both sides. Get those horses out of sight
  among the rocks. You hear me? Get everything out of sight, and see that your
  rifles are loaded. Every man pick his target&mdash;but leave Jim Silver to
  me! I'll take care of him!"</p>

  <p>He made a brief pause as he shot home the last order with a stern glance
  of his eye.</p>

  <p>Then he added: "Now move!"</p>

  <p>They moved on the jump. One glance around the place showed them that it
  was a perfect trap. Even if Jim Silver had led his original two or threescore
  men from Elsinore straight into the mouth of this funnel among the mountains,
  it seemed likely that the dozen sure rifles could curl them up in a red ruin
  and thrust them back.</p>

  <p>Naylor, automatically taking shelter behind a great black boulder, found
  none other than Duff Gregor beside him. And with Duff Gregor was the horse
  that carried the treasure.</p>

  <p>They were well up the side of the mountain; they had a good slant to look
  beyond the mouth of the ravine out onto the lower ground from which Silver
  must approach. And Naylor heard Gregor snarling:</p>

  <p>"There's one thing that makes me sour, and that's Christian reserving
  Silver to himself. I'd like to sink some lead of my own into Jim Silver. I
  could ride the real Parade as well as the next man."</p>

  <p>"Christian's a funny guy," said Naylor slowly. "Maybe he thought that
  you'd feel sort of kindly about Silver since he saved your life for you and
  turned you loose from the men of Crow's Nest."</p>

  <p>Gregor growled: "That what you say? I'm goin' to have words with you after
  this little job's over and we've mopped up Silver and his gang of fools."</p>

  <p>Suddenly curses streamed out of the lips of Naylor. He said savagely: "It
  ain't words that you're goin' to have with me, you swine!"</p>

  <p>Gregor, unexpectedly, said nothing at all.</p>

  <p>And then, through the gap in the mouth of the valley, Naylor had a sudden
  glimpse of the advancing party.</p>

  <p>There were not six men. There were only five men&mdash;and a bare-legged
  youngster who rode without a saddle on a tireless little mustang. The very
  boy who had discovered them and had carried the alarm!</p>

  <p>He was one. There were four others, of whom one, from his size and the way
  he kept close to Jim Silver, was probably that other famous man of battle,
  Taxi. But most of all, foremost in the lot, magnificent on his great, shining
  stallion, came Jim Silver himself.</p>

  <p>Something stood up in the heart of poor Bill Naylor and called that hero
  his master. And something told him that it was better to die a thousand times
  on the side of such a warrior than to live forever surrounded by Christian
  and his crew.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Naylor rose.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Don't show yourself, you fool!" cried Gregor. "They're almost where
  they can see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Naylor laid the barrel of a Colt along the head of Gregor, and with
  satisfaction listened to the ring of the hollow steel. He watched Gregor
  drop, and then he deliberately flung himself into the saddle of the horse
  that carried the treasure and started as wild, as desperate, as hopeless a
  charge as ever a man attempted in this world. For he made the mustang bolt,
  under frenzied spurring, toward the mouth of the ravine, straight out to give
  warning to Jim Silver of the deadly trap which he was approaching.</p>

  <p>His horse had not taken three strides before a voice was shouting:</p>

  <p>"Hey, you crazy fool!"</p>

  <p>That was Cassidy. No other voice had the bull-terrier, whining note of
  battle as did the voice of Cassidy.</p>

  <p>Then the stentorian shout of Barry Christian bellowed through the air:
  "Shoot the traitor! Shoot him!"</p>

  <p>And the rifle fire began.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

   <p class="first">Down the steepness of the slope the flying mustang ran as a torrent of
  water runs, plunging from side to side, angling away from projecting rocks,
  dodging like a snipe in flight from the hunter, and not a single bullet
  struck lucky Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>Well, bullets didn't matter. If he could let some blood, it would carry
  away in its flowing some of the sins of his life, and help to wash his soul
  clean.</p>

  <p>The horse hit the level of the valley floor beneath. The gunfire
  increased. The thunder of it rang all about him, until it seemed from the
  echoing that a thousand guns were working.</p>

  <p>Then a blow struck him on the back between the shoulders, not like a
  bullet, but like a club. The weight of the shock knocked him forward over the
  pommel of the saddle. His whole back was benumbed. Afterward there was a
  shooting thrust of pain right up into his head; and after that the pain
  spread inward toward his heart.</p>

  <p>"They've shot me through the heart," his numb lips said to him. "Why don't
  I die? Heaven won't let me die till I've warned Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>Aye, but Jim Silver was already warned, surely, by the clamor of guns
  inside the death trap that he had so nearly entered. Then why could not Bill
  Naylor stop the mustang and slide down from the saddle and stretch himself on
  the ground?</p>

  <p>To lie there, stretched on the ground, for a moment's respite from the
  agony that was wearing away the strength of his soul!</p>

  <p>Then he understood why he must keep on riding. It was because he was
  carrying with him, back to the hands of the law, the treasure for which one
  man had died already.</p>

  <p>He was going to die, too, he told himself. He wanted only to die like Dick
  Penny. That was the way to meet the end!</p>

  <p>But the best he could do was to scurry away like a frightened rabbit with
  a bullet through his back!</p>

  <p>Well, a man like Jim Silver would understand.</p>

  <p>The mustang staggered suddenly and almost flung him from the saddle. The
  horse had been hit. And as Naylor righted himself in the saddle with dreadful
  labor, there was another shock and numbing blow as a rifle bullet struck him
  at the hip from behind and tore through his flesh, and glanced around the
  thigh bone, and came out above the knee.</p>

  <p>"What kind of luck is this?" said Bill Naylor. "They're going to shoot me
  out of the saddle&mdash;but I got the hoss pretty near to the mouth of the
  ravine already."</p>

  <p>A wave of darkness washed across his brain.</p>

  <p>Another shock, another club stroke. He didn't know where that blow had
  fallen, but now there was warm blood flowing down over his face.</p>

  <p>"I can't feel nothing no more," said Bill Naylor, "except my
  heart&mdash;except my heart."</p>

  <p>That agony devoured all that was inside him, all the heart, all the
  spirit, all the courage.</p>

  <p>Then, like the opening of a door, he was through the mouth of the valley,
  and on either side of him the bright-green of the outer plain extended. He
  saw a group of riders halted. He saw the brilliant sheen of Parade. That was,
  in fact, all that he could see very clearly.</p>

  <p>Jim Silver would have to be in the saddle on that horse.</p>

  <p>So he made for Silver.</p>

  <p>He saw the wink of light along leveled gun barrels, and he heard voices
  shouting to him to halt, and then the cry of Silver bidding the others to
  hold their hands. Then, suddenly, he was drawing rein, or trying to, beside
  Silver.</p>

  <p>But he could not draw rein slowly enough. The wounded mustang came to a
  pitching halt that slewed Bill Naylor out of the saddle and rolled him on the
  grass. Every time he rolled he left a spot of blood. He rolled over and over
  twenty times, and when he looked to the side he could see the crimson trail
  that he had made on the grass.</p>

  <p>Better on grass than on rocks. Far better on grass than on rocks!</p>

  <p>The blue sky was revolving around him like a spinning wheel. He was being
  lifted up into the blue. He was somewhere high up, among the bright drifting
  of the clouds.</p>

  <p>Then a voice boomed in his ears. He looked with a vast effort.</p>

  <p>"Silver," he said. "Is that you?"</p>

  <p>He could see nothing, only the whirl of the blue; but the voice of Jim
  Silver, wonderfully deep and gentle, was saying:</p>

  <p>"I'm Jim Silver, partner."</p>

  <p>A faint smile pulled at the numb lips of Naylor. Partner? Well, it was
  just as well that Silver did not know the darkness of his past! And for five
  minutes to be esteemed noble by such a man, was not that enough?</p>

  <p>"Silver," he said, "they're in there, waiting, I seen you coming, and
  couldn't stand it. I got on the hoss that carried the loot from the train.
  It's all there. Watch yourself. They're all in there. Barry Christian and ten
  more!"</p>

  <p>"Barry Christian!" cried Silver. "Barry Christian?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," murmured Naylor.</p>

  <p>Then, distantly, he heard the voice of Silver saying: "Taxi, stay here
  with him. Watch him as if he were yourself. Keep the kid with you. I'll scout
  on ahead."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE WAY TO GO</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS the sort of a thing that every one knows how to
  appreciate, for it was the sort of thing that every man of us hopes may be
  possible in himself&mdash;a change forever from the bad to the good.</p>

  <p>They found out all about Bill Naylor while he lay flat on his back in the
  hotel room in the little, grimy town of Benton Corner. The newspapers found
  out; they lived on the trail until they had located his associates of older
  days&mdash;most of them in prison, and most of them willing to talk. They
  found the marshals and sheriffs who had arrested him in the past and the
  posses that had assisted on occasion. Some of these informants grinned and
  shook their heads, but most of them had pleasant things to say. A crook?
  Sure, Bill Naylor had been a crook, but he had always been the sort of stuff
  that can turn straight when the right time comes for turning.</p>

  <p>Honest men, reading their newspapers of a morning, shook their heads and
  smiled, also. They were pleased. We have all done shady things, cruel things,
  evil things; and we all hope that we will never do them again. The story of
  Bill Naylor helped every man to believe in himself a little more, to have
  faith in that higher self which obscurely struggles with the baser.</p>

  <p>But Bill Naylor, as he lay in his bed in the hotel room in Benton Corner,
  knew very little about all of this for many days.</p>

  <p>The first thing that he was aware of when he opened his eyes and
  discovered with bewilderment that a weak pulse of life was still throbbing in
  him, was the almost handsome face of Taxi. The pale, bright, dangerous eyes
  were fixed steadily upon him.</p>

  <p>"By thunder, Taxi," said Naylor unevenly, "how come you're here?"</p>

  <p>"I'm the wake," said Taxi with a faint smile. "I'm waiting&mdash;and it
  seems as though you're going to wake up and live out the rest of your days.
  You've got to. If you don't, Silver will hound me around the world."</p>

  <p>Naylor looked at the ceiling. He wanted to shake his head, but there was
  hardly enough strength for even that gesture.</p>

  <p>"That's funny," he said. "Jim Silver, he wants me to pull through?"</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver's not a hound," said Taxi. "He wants you to live through.
  Because&mdash;I'll tell you a queer thing&mdash;Jim Silver is sort of fond of
  a man who's saved his life twice in a row!"</p>

  <p>Naylor considered this thing curiously with a detached mind.</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver's still on the out trail, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"And he'll never leave it," said Taxi. "Not till he's run Barry Christian
  to the ground. If Barry Christian were the devil and could take a thousand
  forms, I think Silver would find 'em one by one and strangle them all. It's
  the end for Christian."</p>

  <p>Taxi sat close beside the bed. His eyes were set back in deep, dark
  hollows. His face was drawn.</p>

  <p>"You go to sleep again," he said. "Because now I'm going to have a chance
  to do a little snoozing on my own account."</p>

  <p>And Naylor, dreamily smiling, went back to sleep.</p>

  <p>It was a long time after that when he wakened again. Then he heard a
  girl's voice saying:</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't bother him none. I just wanted to look at him."</p>

  <p>That was the voice of Sally Townsend, and the voice of her father
  muttered:</p>

  <p>"Don't you be a fool, Sally. He's gone and got himself famous now. He
  wouldn't be wanting to see you."</p>

  <p>"Sally!" said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>There was a whispering of clothes. She stood above him.</p>

  <p>She looked better in overalls than in store clothes, with a foolish hat
  perched high on her head, and her hair pulled back so tight that her eyebrows
  were raised a little.</p>

  <p>She looked like a small girl dressed as a grown-up. He had to squint and
  glance back into his memory before he could recall her to his mind as she was
  before&mdash;as she really was.</p>

  <p>She was frightened. Her eyes were too big for the pupils. They showed a
  lot of white all around. And she had gloves on her strong brown hands.
  Suddenly he wanted to get her away from the sight of every one. Out on the
  range&mdash;that was where she belonged.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Bill!" she said in a husky whisper.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Sally!" said he.</p>

  <p>"Shall I get out of here?" asked the soft voice of Taxi.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Naylor. "Meet Sally Townsend. How I wish that Jim
  Silver was here to meet her, too."</p>

  <p>"Jim would like to be here, I know," said Taxi.</p>

  <p>"This is Taxi," said Naylor. "And this is Sally Town-send, who's promised
  that she'll marry me."</p>

  <p>"Jiminy!" said the girl. "Are you Taxi? Are you the Taxi?"</p>

  <p>Taxi took her hand. He said that he was happy to meet her. He only wished
  that Jim Silver were there, too, because he said that Jim Silver thought a
  great deal of Bill Naylor and would want nothing so much as to see the girl
  he was going to marry. He said that they would all have to be good friends,
  because they all belonged to Silver's side of everything. It was quite a
  speech, quite a pretty speech. Taxi was capable of them, now and again.</p>

  <p>Then he got out of the room, but big Townsend came and stood at the foot
  of the bed. He had shaved off his ragged beard, and his face looked boyish
  and rather pale, except for the dark tan around the eyes. And he had on a
  high stiff white collar that choked him. The necktie had worked down and
  showed the brass sheen of the collar button.</p>

  <p>"Well, Townsend, I'm lucky I'm not up," said Bill Naylor.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Townsend, gaping a little.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Naylor, "if I was up, you'd lick me because I'm trying to get
  Sally. I'm a lot safer in bed."</p>

  <p>Townsend grinned. Sally sat down on the edge of the bed and took Naylor's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"You've talked enough," she said. "Dad, go on away."</p>

  <p>Townsend went away.</p>

  <p>"When you get better, we'll talk a lot about things to come and the way
  we're going," she concluded firmly.</p>

  <p>"There's only one way to go," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>"What way is that?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Straight," said Bill Naylor.</p>
