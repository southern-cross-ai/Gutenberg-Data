<h2>FOREWORD<br>
by<br>
L. A. ROBB, C.M.G.,<br>
State President, R.S.S.I.L.A., N.S.W.</h2>

<p>I could hope that those who have not known war will be
privileged to read this really sincere and unvarnished
autobiography of a young soldier who, like very many of his boyhood
fellows, was cruelly shattered, in war. Something very much more
than a plain simple tale this; something more than a wartime
autobiography. It breathes a spirit, a faith, and an idealism that
used to be&mdash;and still is.</p>

<p>A war story, to sadden and to inspire, by one blasted and
wrecked in that disaster which was Fromelles in 1916; by one whose
optimism has survived uncomprehended tortures since the tide of
battle left him stranded, a pathetic fragment of humanity, on the
forbidding shores of post-war. A man who is still the
light-hearted, fearless boy that used to be, looking back, glad and
proud, while not ignoring the tragedy and the futilities, that he
was there.</p>

<p>It is a story that, in parts, might perhaps have been written by
any one of the 316,000 members of the Australian Imperial Force who
felt that their duty called overseas in 1914-18, could their pens
trace the inspiration&mdash;convert the inner thought. Here is real
atmosphere, so elusive always, and difficult to capture and
imprison on the printed page&mdash;the atmosphere which only the
soldier knew and none other can ever create.</p>

<p>The spirit that was of the famous battalions permeates this book
and there is stark reality, humour, and incident that take the
memory back down the dimming avenue of the past to vivid, wild,
joyous, bitter, tragic years, the axis upon which the thoughts and
lives of all ex-service men turn.</p>

<p>Here is also an epic of indomitable courage in the after-war,
and of a happy spirit, invincible in torture and suffering that
cannot even be imagined by those whose bodies have not been torn
and hacked in the ghastliness of war and brought again and again to
the operating tables, and who have not waged grim war with the
leering, luring, drug fiends.</p>

<p>A soldier's soul is here bared.</p>

<h2>FOREWORD<br>
by<br>
"AN UNKNOWN SOLDIER"</h2>

<p>Greatly I appreciate having been asked to pen this foreword to
<i>There And Back,</i> a story which, I am confident, is crowned
already with that most difficult distinction, great usefulness.
Some outstanding quality must justify any narrative, but, it seems
to me, in this one all such qualities are so inextricably mixed
that it is impossible to select confidently the impression that
stirs one most, for the humorous precocity of the author's initial
attempt to enlist is quite overshadowed by an awed comprehension of
the lurid dangers into which he was rushing headlong, and the
glowing eagerness of his youthful ambition is somehow made
pitifully poignant by the cruel price of suffering he was made to
pay.</p>

<p>But valour, endurance, and intelligence are the qualities that
shine most conspicuously and all unconsciously in these pages, and
these things must be an inspiration to every youth who gets this
book in his hands. No better trial for manhood could ever be
devised than a twelvemonth of service with a wartime battalion of
Australian infantry, and the manner in which "Ted" stood this
testing, while still only a boy, should strike an inspiring note in
the heart of every young man.</p>

<p>Living recklessly, the dangers he faced were tenfold, but the
only way a youth can win the admiring confidence of mature men is
illuminated here with a clarity unmistakable. The one brief period
of strutting and aping at the vices of older men is the clear
background against which his sober determination to excel and
prosper shows best, and any experienced soldier will instantly
descry in him those particular qualities of conduct that were so
highly esteemed by Australian fighting troops.</p>

<p>Self-reliance, confidence, and alert service brought him
preferment shrewdly bestowed, and ready humour and efficiency
retained it.</p>

<p>Any word-monger's easy flowing fancy can capture on dexterous
pen the fictitious poses of an ideal hero, but few men can aptly
express their own sufferings. The very intensity of this author's
agony seeps unknowingly into his words and they sear the heart.
Understanding of the awful price in suffering the war made some men
pay, should awake anew a watchfulness that the things they held for
us are not despised; and a brief comparison of the grim facts in
this story with the settled security of our common lives to-day
should win an instantaneous sympathy for the author's tale.</p>

<p>While its merits should win a ready praise, it is the humour
that flashes in patches of brightness that brings an indescribable
stamp of conviction to this narrative, and it builds up a certitude
that the writer has told his message in the most fitting way as</p>

<p>The happy warrior...<br>
Whose high endeavours are an inward light<br>
That makes the path before him always bright.</p>

<p>And the characters that live with him also are all striking
types recognizable anywhere to-day among returned soldiers, and
their story moves with a swinging rhythm, a provocative march-time
lilt, that must captivate all veterans of the old A.I.F., as, out
from the strange confusion of early camp days, the narrative
gathers gradually increasing cohesion and momentum in passing over
the seas and crossing Egyptian sands, until, like a curving,
rushing wave, it bursts at last with a surging shock on those
German breastworks at Fromelles.</p>

<p>Ah, what a tragedy was there, when all Australia felt the
crushing weight of war's blundering futility. What a realization it
was that war was waged by incompetent men as it always is, for war
is a peculiarly incompetent activity. So we must now remember it
not as a glory, not as a defeat, but as a cruel punishment for the
crime of insufficient understanding of the problem of war. We know
now that our strong hand methods have failed, the weapons we used
destroyed more than we gained, but this we did, we proved that the
problem of war is a moral one, that it is a rotten thing based on
rottenness, yet a just scourge from which the world is not yet
worthy to be free.</p>

<p>"AN UNKNOWN SOLDIER."</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE TO REX</h2>

<p>Much water has passed under the bridge since you came on a
hurried visit from Tamworth to see me at Randwick Hospital in
August, 1932. Though I do not recollect much of what happened, or
nearly happened, during the final six weeks of my half-year sojourn
there, I do remember your arrival at my bedside as the jolly old
Canon concluded his few last words.</p>

<p>Just what he said to help me over the divide I cannot recall,
but I am mindful of your suggestion that I should write a book.
Maybe you said that in an heroic endeavour to persuade me, during
what seemed to you and others to be my last hour, that my life had
been worth something to others; or perhaps you thought that, if I
did by any chance recover, a little writing to remind myself of the
"wickedly" past would keep me quiet for a while.</p>

<p>Well, I tricked the undertaker once again and proceeded to have
a fling ere the family returned from Blighty in the ensuing
October. After eighteen months of grass-widowership, the process of
getting back to domestic paths and taking up the reins to guide the
children (still three, in case you are presumptuous) caused me to
forget my troubles and recent associations.</p>

<p>My son and heir, aged six, having during his trip abroad
witnessed the trooping of the colour, the changing of the guard at
Buckingham Palace, and a military tattoo, informed me, that he,
too, was going to be a soldier. Perceiving with mixed feelings of
pride and regret that he was made of the same stuff as his father,
and being unable to answer his many questions offhand without
prejudicing his youthful mind one way or the other, I remembered
your suggestion and resolved to put my experiences on paper.</p>

<p>Here's the manuscript. I am afraid it will offend some people
with literary and ethical tastes (the war and its aftermath were a
bit coarse in parts), and the credibility of others will at times
be somewhat taxed. However, it mirrors myself, as I was and felt,
and others as I saw them at the time. It is "dinkum;" and that is
why in the narrative I have changed my name, and have also referred
to others simply by their Christian names or nicknames in case
they, like myself, do not like too much of the limelight of truth.
There is another good reason why I have used the name "Ted." It is
my second Christian name (Edward)&mdash;I was called after my
father. Then again I gave it to my eldest son, so being well and
truly worn, like myself, it is rather appropriate. Furthermore, it
gives the Dad a place in the history of his chip&mdash;a doubtful
compliment to a most tolerant, forbearing, and sporting
father&mdash;but a tribute nevertheless. To Mother and Father,
their fathers and forefathers, I owe everything for the healthy
constitution that has pulled me through, and if I, a chip off such
a block, am a bit splintered, well it's of my own making.</p>

<p>In writing this story I have lived much of my life over
again&mdash;the pain, the humility, the bad, all have their place,
if only to give one a better appreciation of the pleasure, the
pride and the good. In the passing of the kindly mellowing years
one remembers less and less the pain, yet how easy it is to recall
the pleasures that we had. Some of the old diversions are recalled
with feelings of some discontent, Fritz and the surgeons having
left me my conscience.</p>

<p>I was not in the battle of the Wazir, or at Anzac, or in the
Somme mud, or on leave in Blighty. Mine was a very small part, and
it must be multiplied many millions of times before one can form
any conception of the four years of war in which I saw but nine
days in action. My purpose, however, has been to draw a picture of
the war and its aftermath as I saw it, lived it, hated it, and
loved it at the time. And, in case another war should ever darken
the world's horizon, the following pages may do something to
enlighten readers with regard to war.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I. CHILDHOOD: ABOUT
TURN</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Comes of British
stock&mdash;Seeks adventure in a sewer&mdash;Learns scripture and
deportment&mdash;Receives a black eye&mdash;Plays truant&mdash;Wins

<p class="cp">(June 1899&mdash;June 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p>Edward Rowland, born of Australian parents at Sydney on the 20th
of June 1899, was working in his father's factory when war was
declared in 1914. His grandfather of the one side and
great-grandfather of the other, descended from British seamen
(thought to be pirates) and English countryfolk respectively, had
been among the first pioneers to settle in Victoria, where they and
their descendants engaged in mining, horticultural, and commercial
pursuits. It is therefore not surprising that "Ted," coming from
such stock, was of sturdy physique, and was endowed with the spirit
of adventure and patriotism.</p>

<p>Ted's brief childhood was sufficiently varied to equip him with
at least the fundamental requirements of life. Setting out on an
adventure at the age of four, he was some hours later discovered in
an open sewer, minus his clothes. Later, after running the gauntlet
of pneumonia, scarlet fever, and chicken pox, he was placed at a
private school where scripture and deportment were the principal
subjects on the curriculum. With his natural instincts somewhat
subdued by this environment he entered upon a public school
education, and within a week was initiated into the art of taking
knocks&mdash;the first resulting in a black eye.</p>

<p>Following on a lengthy truancy from school during which he built
a hut in a mangrove swamp and sailed the shark-infested waters of
the Parramatta River in a home-made canvas boat, the boy achieved
the not unexpected distinction of coming last in the school
examination. A conference of father and schoolmaster thereupon
resolved that, as chastisement had proved of no avail, they would
try other methods. So Ted received a bicycle from his father and
was appointed monitor to his master, and he responded by coming
third at the subsequent examination in token of which he received
the school's prize for progress&mdash;<i>Robinson Crusoe.</i></p>

<p>Perhaps the adventures of Crusoe or his own satisfaction in
considering that he had proved his ability, or perhaps both, gave
Ted sufficient excuse for relaxation, but, whatever the cause, the
remainder of his school-days were marked by sporting rather than
scholastic achievements. He is probably remembered by his
school-mates as captain of the footer team and runner-up in the
swimming championship, but most of all for his chronic state of
black eyes and occasional victories in fistic combat. As a
chorister he led the church choir boys in everything but singing,
and it must have been a great relief to the verger when Ted's voice
broke, and he retired from that confraternity.</p>

<p>Much against his parents' wishes, he left school at the age of
fourteen and was put to work in his father's business, where he
remained&mdash;though, after the novelty had worn off, much against
his inclination&mdash;for the next two years, up to the time of his
enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force.</p>

<p>When the exigencies of compulsory military training allowed, he
would tour the country on his bicycle in the holidays, carrying his
provisions and sleeping out. On one such trip, which occupied three
days, he covered 339 miles in a round trip from Sydney, touching at
Burragorang, Wombeyan Caves, Goulburn, Moss Vale, Kangaroo Valley,
and Nowra. This was no mean feat for a boy of but fourteen summers,
who already had to his credit the saving of two lives from
drowning.</p>

<p>If, during June or July of 1914, Ted heard anything of the
assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, it is probable that
he promptly forgot it, for at that time his thoughts were mainly
centred on a pretty girl who worked in a neighbouring factory. In
exchange for penny-dreadfuls and an occasional bunch of violets he
was allowed to accompany her as far as, but no farther than, her
railway destination, and, as his weekly supply of pocket money was
limited, it must be assumed that he booked more than one fare to
the then equivalent of "Kitchener."</p>

<p>After the declaration of war his premature springtime fancies
turned to thoughts of adventure. Newspapers and military text-books
supplanted the penny-dreadfuls, while the scent of violets at least
temporarily evaporated. Orators and the sight of so many khaki-clad
figures fired his youthful imagination, but his first visit to
Victoria Barracks, a suit of overalls covering his short pants,
resulted merely in Ted's offer of enlistment being "received" by
the sentry at the main gates. It was not until after Christmas of
1914, when he first got into long trousers that he succeeded in
even gaining an entry to the Barracks. Taking his place in line
with that morning's batch of volunteers he was confronted by a
sergeant-major, who did not appear satisfied with the youth's
answers concerning his age.</p>

<p>"Know anything about soldiering?" asked the S.M.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," came the ready reply.</p>

<p>"About turn! Quick march! Double!"</p>

<p>Receiving no further command, as he headed for the gate, Ted
took the "office."</p>

<p>Though hurt in his pride and feeling wholly dejected, he
nevertheless found some consolation in believing that those who
predicted the early termination of hostilities might be wrong, and
that the war would last more than another six months. So, with the
idea of qualifying for the light horse, he saved sufficient money
to hire a horse for a week-end, but after the first day's riding
found it more comfortable to stand than sit. Next experimenting
with a bugle, he had almost perfected the "Cook-house Door" when
the patriotic patience of the neighbours petered out, and in
silence he sounded "Retreat."</p>

<p>By the time when the news of the landing at Gallipoli arrived,
Ted's frequent calls at the Barracks had led to a distant sparring
acquaintance between him and the sergeant-major. But, except for
his new-found interest in compulsory military training and the
recent attainment of the rank of signal-corporal in the Senior
Cadets, and three evenings of each week&mdash;when he was supposed
to be at night school&mdash;in the company of a Boer War veteran
turned night watchman, the time dragged wearily on to June.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II. STANDING EASY</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">A 16th birthday
present&mdash;A successful cough&mdash;A tail of a shirt&mdash;A
Liverpool Marmalade&mdash;A camp concert and a night without
pyjamas.</p>

<p class="cp">(June&mdash;July 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p>Sunday, 20 June 1915, was Ted's sixteenth birthday. His parents,
fearful lest he should run away from home and join up under an
assumed name in another State, compromised by giving their consent
to his enlistment conditional upon his entering the signalling
corps. It was their fond belief that the training for this unit
would take at least twelve months, by which time the war might be
over; and it is just possible also that they considered that army
discipline might bring the boy's spirit under control.</p>

<p>With the ink hardly dry on this document&mdash;his most
cherished birthday present&mdash;Ted again confronted his friend
the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>"What! You bloody well here again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, have a look at this," said Ted, producing his parents'
consent.</p>

<p>"What's your age?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen, sir."</p>

<p>"Stand easy."</p>

<p>Which he did with the utmost satisfaction in having, at last,
settled his differences with the jolly old sergeant-major.</p>

<p>The rest was easy, being not at all unfamiliar to one who had
received "inside" information from many who had been through the
preliminaries. Particulars as to full name, date and place of
birth, colour of eyes, hair and complexion, weight, and height,
were duly recorded, and parental consent noted by a clerk in the
recruiting office; and Ted, having expanded his chest, shown feet,
said ninety-nine and coughed successfully, was ordered to report at
the barracks on Monday, 19 July, ready for camp.</p>

<p>Though elated with this initial success he was conscious of yet
a few more difficulties to be overcome. For example, he was a
trainee under the compulsory service act, and the issue of a
summons as the result of his absence from future parades would of
course lead to the discovery of his enlistment in the A.I.F. under
the prescribed age. But this was "fixed up" after a friendly talk
with his Area Officer, to whom he gave an undertaking to attend as
many parades as possible prior to embarking for service
overseas.</p>

<p>Then there was the question of his military shirt. Compulsory
trainees over eighteen years of age were in the militia and had on
their shirts shoulder straps, which were not included on those of
the senior cadets. So if Ted's cadet shirt was to be worn to camp
it became necessary to make the required addition. A friend
apprenticed in tailoring adjusted this matter by making shoulder
straps out of material cut from the tail of the garment.</p>

<p>Monday, 19 July 1915, was ushered in with rain. This might have
been taken as a bad omen&mdash;as events turned out, on the very
first anniversary of his signing on for "three years or the
duration," Fritz and fate in the Battle of Fromelles extended this
period for life. But this was not a day to sit in the shadows of
coming events. Rising from his bed after a sleepless night, Ted
hurriedly bathed and, dressing in his slightly remodelled cadet
uniform, sat down to the family breakfast. What with the incessant
questioning of his younger brothers and sisters, the thoughtful
silence of Mother and Dad, and his own pent-up feelings, it was
with the greatest difficulty that he contrived to be outwardly calm
and inwardly fed.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the youth strapped up his valise and, with a
lump&mdash;or was it breakfast&mdash;in his throat, grinned and
said good-bye. Hearing but not remembering the words of parting,
seeing without looking back, feeling kiss and handshake still with
him, he set forth on the long adventure. On the train he chewed
rather than smoked a cigarette, and, after a fit of coughing,
received lengthy abuse from an old lady who threatened him with her
gamp for being in a non-smoker. Blushing freely he came back to
earth, and by the time the train reached Sydney was thinking of the
day ahead.</p>

<p>On arrival at Victoria Barracks Ted sought out his old friend
the sergeant-major, but if he expected a welcome home he was
disappointed, for that gentleman merely ordered him to "wait."
Wait! Why, the S.M. knew that Ted had already experienced eleven
months of waiting, but perhaps after all, he used the word by way
of recognition.</p>

<p>As the recruits arrived they gathered in groups and, the muster
being a particularly large one, it seemed that all walks of life
were represented. Ted attached himself to the group attired mostly
in various cuts of khaki, and was agreeably surprised to find an
old school chum, "Dab," some two years his senior. This group
listened attentively for a while to the experiences of a New Guinea
veteran, and was in the midst of a round of smutty yarns, when
without the ceremony of a bugle call the order was given to "Fall
in!"</p>

<p>Stepping out and re-forming lines in order of the roll-call
effectively split up the groups, and, after numbering, the
form-fours shuffle brought Ted in between a seaman and a chap with
a bowler hat. As the column marched out of the barracks and Ted
passed the sergeant-major, he could not resist a final word.</p>

<p>"So long, Major!"</p>

<p>"So long my boy, good luck!"</p>

<p>The recruits, receiving an occasional cheer as they swung along
the road, were conscious of their motley appearance, and it was not
until tramping through Surry Hills, when someone produced a
mouth-organ, that they found their spirits. Some singing, some
laughing, and others cursing the march, they arrived at Central
Station and heartily cheered the engine for its whistle of
cock-a-doodle-do. Entrained, the starting whistle was the signal
for another wild outburst of cheering, which was repeated at each
of the first few stations through which the train passed, and then
the company settled down. Ted, who had taken a part, though not a
leading one, in the cheering, accepted a dainty sandwich from his
companion of the bowler hat and, after a gulp from another's bottle
of beer, did the honours with cigarettes.</p>

<p>Detraining at Liverpool and crossing the river bridge they
entered camp and were greeted by some thousands of their
predecessors, who lined the lane-way between the huts and loudly
jeered "Marmalades! "&mdash;signifying initiation to a camp where
marmalade constituted the staple food.</p>

<p>The ceremony of attestation&mdash;taking the oath of allegiance,
with the Bible grasped in the right hand&mdash;reminded Ted of the
seriousness of his undertaking, but still uppermost in his mind was
the fear of his age being found out. The rest of the afternoon was
spent in getting established. Divided into squads they were marched
to the quartermaster's store, where each was issued with blankets,
dungarees, white hat, boots, socks, flannel shirts, tin plate,
knife, fork and spoon. On returning there was a wild scramble for
empty palliasses and straw, which had been dumped in the middle of
the hut. Though some succeeded in getting palliasses and others had
equal success with the straw, Ted, in spite of a good deal of rough
handling, was one of the few who got both.</p>

<p>At the final parade of the day, after the orderlies for the
morrow had been detailed it was intimated that although no leave
would be granted that night, the troops were free to wander within
the limits of the camp until 9.30, when they must be in the hut to
answer roll call. At 10 o'clock, lights were to be put out. The
parade was then dismissed, though not before several unsuccessful
attempts had been made to carry out the order.</p>

<p>The evening meal&mdash;bread and marmalade, with a pannikin of
sweet, black tea&mdash;being hurriedly taken, Ted and Dab set out
on a tour of inspection. After viewing a cook-house and inspecting
the guard, they had a look at the river and discussed it as an
avenue for taking French leave, bought some cigarettes and lollies
at the canteen and then finished up at the Y.M.C.A. tent where an
impromptu concert was in progress. A song about a little grey home
in the west was followed by a cornet solo; a humorous recitation
was then given a good hearing, but a well-rendered classic on the
piano was soon counted out and the concert resolved itself into
chorus singing.</p>

<p>Less than the full number put in an appearance at roll-call, but
as a reply&mdash;in some cases more than one&mdash;was received to
each name called, it was let go at that. Except for some
good-natured chaffing of those who produced pyjamas (Ted left his
in his valise), there was comparative quiet for the half-hour
preceding "lights out," all being more or less engaged in making
preparations for turning in. This, however, was but the lull before
the storm.</p>

<p>The scene that followed lights out began with an organized raid,
some twenty toughs grabbing the ends of palliasses and pulling them
from under their owners, who at first dealt out blows at random and
then joined in the raid themselves. It was no time before the whole
hut was in a state of turmoil, and more than one suffered as the
light-fingered took advantage of the darkness. When a lull occurred
in the yelling, shouting, and swearing, the hut sergeant threatened
to bring in the guard, but he was promptly told what he could do.
He thereupon retired, and the mob sorted itself out and
subsided.</p>

<p>Taking stock with the aid of matches, Ted found that, apart from
having fallen into the filthy mess of someone's vomit, he had not
come out of the raid badly. He had managed to secure a well-filled
palliasse in lieu of his own, and had lost only his issue knife,
which he determined to replace in the morning.</p>

<p>Indelicate remarks&mdash;mostly crude, though occasionally
witty&mdash;now bandied back and forth, were signals for renewed
laughter and rebukes, which, though subdued, were sufficiently
effective to keep all hands awake. It was well after one o'clock
before peace and quiet, except for a few coughs and snores, reigned
in the hut. Reviewing the events of the day, Ted's mind at first
dwelt in shame on some of the unpleasant episodes and his minor
parts in them, but it was not long ere his thoughts wandered back
to the haven of home and in its blessing he found sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III. MARKING TIME</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Physical jerks and
china dogs&mdash;A brief command&mdash;A returning leave
train&mdash;Assuming manhood&mdash;A sergeant's medicine and
duty&mdash;Beer and breath lollies&mdash;A father's advice&mdash;A
trip to Melbourne and back to the 30th Battalion.</p>

<p class="cp">(July&mdash;August 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p>Awakening with reveille and hurriedly dressing to the skirl of
Scotch pipers whose job it was to rouse the camp, Ted was one of
the few ready to fall in for physical jerks parade. When at last
the late-comers had fallen into line and the sergeant had abused
all and sundry, he went into further fits of abuse as he
endeavoured to put them through numbering, separating odd from even
numbers, and opening ranks. Being sufficiently familiar with the
exercises&mdash;bending backward, forward and to the sides, bending
arms and legs and turning head left and right&mdash;Ted had time to
concentrate on and marvel at the instructor's versatility. He was
picked out and ordered to the front as a good example, but was sent
back to the ranks on bursting into laughter when the sergeant
suddenly exploded: "Gawd a'Mighty, yer as stiff and slow as a lot
of china dogs."</p>

<p>All signs of stiffness however, vanished when the squad was
dismissed and the orderlies arrived with breakfast. Had all hands
been trained in athletics they could not have been more active in
their rush on the dixies.</p>

<p>Ted's khaki shirt, on account of the piece missing from the
tail, already had earned him the name of "Freezer;" but it was also
apparently responsible for his being detailed to take charge of a
squad. And had he adhered to text-book regulations instead of
trying to emulate the pomposity of the sergeant who conducted the
physical culture parade, he probably would have been made a
corporal. At first the members of his squad were bewildered and
then indignant at having a kid in charge of them, but resentment
turned to amusement and culminated in a wild outburst of laughter,
when he stood them at ease and addressed them in the regular
sergeant-major style thus:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time when I was a little boy I had a box of wooden
soldiers. I loved my wooden soldiers and became more and more
attached to them as time went on. Then came a day when we moved
away and the wooden soldiers were lost. I cried and cried; and my
mother said, 'Never mind, my boy, your soldiers will all come back
some day'&mdash;and now by cripes they have."</p>

<p>Unknown to Ted, the sergeant was standing behind him as he
related this story. After joining in the laughter, the N.C.O. made
use of a hefty boot and so it was that Ted, much to his
satisfaction yet physical discomfort, was relieved of his
short-lived command.</p>

<p>To those with previous experience of military training the
elementary stages of drill were most uninteresting, but Ted's sense
of humour saved him and he found much amusement in seeing and
hearing the awkward recruits being put through their paces.</p>

<p>That night he was given leave. Not waiting for tea he hurried
off to the station, his valise containing pyjamas and other
articles as did not become a private soldier. Feeling about a foot
taller on arrival home, he did justice to his dinner, told Mother
and Dad all about the nice chaps he knew in camp, and said that the
sergeant was a little bit "rough" but was going to get him into the
signallers; and after supper, when he had convinced Mother that it
was against orders to wear pyjamas in camp, invited the family to
visit him the following Sunday. Then, with a bag of home-made cakes
under his arm and head full of advice, he hurried off for the
train.</p>

<p>The returning leave train with its mixed freight of humans
caused Ted, when trying to sleep that night, to ponder on the
strange ways of men. The great majority in that train were of
course decent fellows, and they attracted little notice; as usual,
it was those in various stages of drunkenness&mdash;sleeping,
laughing, cursing, crying, vomiting, fighting or arguing&mdash;or
with immoral women, who gave the superficial observer a disjointed
and wrong perspective of life.</p>

<p>Like most others and particularly the younger men, Ted soon
acquired the habit of evincing a coarseness of manner, which,
though at times causing him to feel inwardly ashamed, served him as
a means to outwardly establish and demonstrate his manhood.
Adapting himself to all phases of this new life, two weeks'
training hardened him to soldiering. He growled with the others
about the food, complained with them about the drill, and helped to
plan revenge on the sergeant for not allowing regulation rests on
the route marches.</p>

<p>Some few miles out on a march one day the sergeant, who for
about a mile, had shown signs of discomfort, called a halt. It
transpired that someone had put caustic soda in his boots, and so,
after placing Ted in charge, he returned to camp. When he
disappeared from sight, the troops, without waiting for an order,
ambled down to the river with Ted bringing up the rear, and there
enjoyed a quiet hour before returning to camp. Whether or not the
medical officer diagnosed the sergeant's complaint is not known,
but the events of the next day seemed to indicate that he had
ordered m. (medicine)&mdash;in the shape of a number nine
pill&mdash;and d. (duty), which, much to the discomfort of the
troops, the sergeant carried out with callousness and
determination.</p>

<p>After a fortnight's training&mdash;during which there flew
around many wild rumours known as "latrine wirelesses," and later
"furphies," (Furphy being the name of the sanitary contractor at
Broadmeadows Camp, Victoria)&mdash;the destiny of Ted's "mob" was
determined, through its being classified as "C" Company, 30th
Battalion. Leaving their palliasses and the much disliked sergeant
behind, they now took up residence in a bell-tent encampment
farther along the river bank. To be posted to an original unit was
the ambition of most recruits; and, although living in tents meant
still more congestion and discomfort, it was regarded, at least by
Ted, as being more soldier-like. That night he was detailed for the
guard, and was looking forward to the experience; but, happening to
be the only one to fall-in in a khaki rig-out&mdash;the others were
still obliged to wear the blue dungarees that had been issued to
them at the outset&mdash;he was accordingly dismissed from the
parade.</p>

<p>A few days later Ted was selected, with others, to attend a
signalling school in Melbourne. Much to the envy of those staying
behind, they were marched to the Quartermaster's Store and issued
with uniforms, numerals, badges and kit-bags. This occurred on a
Saturday afternoon, and they were to leave for the south on the
following day.</p>

<p>Ted hurried home, dressed in full uniform and carrying his
kit-bag. As he walked from his home-station he was very proud of
himself and felt that everyone was looking at him, as indeed they
were, though probably thinking more of his youthful than his
soldierly appearance. Of course he simply <i>had</i> to call and
have a pint at the hotel where a week ago he had been refused a
drink for being under age. Then, after visiting a few shopkeepers
for the sole purpose of answering their anticipated questions as to
when he was going away, he bought some breath-lollies and arrived
home.</p>

<p>What might possibly have been his last day at home&mdash;for the
latest "furphy" had it that they would embark from
Melbourne&mdash;was by no means a happy experience. His brothers
and sisters were quiet and Mother and Dad were most serious. Ted
had a feeling that they might alter their minds and not allow him
to go away. While at odd moments' they did give thought to taking
such action, their patriotism and feeling of pride in their son
would not allow them to go back on their word.</p>

<p>The silence of father and son sitting side by side looking into
the glowing coals of the evening fire was at last broken when the
former, overcoming his restraint, warned his son of the many
pitfalls of life and particularly those of a sexual nature. When
the time came for him to return to camp, Ted assured his family
that, although he would be back from Melbourne in a few weeks, he
would write to them often; and he made the parting as brief as
possible.</p>

<p>That night it was a most thoughtful lad who, after making a hole
in the ground for his hip, and placing a waterproof sheet under
him, rolled up in his blankets and tried in vain to sleep.</p>

<p>Next day the lad's father visited him in camp and they talked of
anything and everything except the subjects of the previous
evening, which made Ted feel glad. He introduced Dad to his pals
and they all gave good reports. One of the company&mdash;the father
of an old school chum of Ted, and now affectionately called "Dad"
by all the boys&mdash;gave an undertaking that he would keep an eye
on the lad. This offer was resented by Ted, but much appreciated by
his father.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd to see them off from the Central Station
at Sydney that night. After the train started, Ted found little
chance of thinking or looking back, for a company of Queenslanders,
already past the farewell stage, kicked up Hell's own row and
caused trouble all the way to Melbourne.</p>

<p>On arrival in Melbourne they marched over Prince's Bridge to the
signalling school in the Domain. Obtaining leave, Ted visited his
uncle at Moonee Ponds, and returned to camp to find the rain coming
through the flyless square tent and his cream blankets covered with
mud. That night he wrote home a letter in which he said that he was
well and was having a good time; but refrained from mentioning how
one of the Queenslanders climbed through a window and scrambled
along to another compartment, while the train was going, or of the
smashing of windows and window bars on the Victorian train, though
he did say something of a fight at Seymour.</p>

<p>It turned out that there had been some mistake in sending them
to Melbourne, so, like the Grand Old Duke of York's men who marched
up the hill and then marched down again, they arrived back in
Sydney after spending only one night in Melbourne. Looking very
weary and showing signs of a merry night's journey, they were
marched to Victoria Barracks, given lunch at a cheap eating-house
in Paddington, and returned to Liverpool, to be posted to
headquarters signallers, 30th Battalion.</p>

BOYS</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Once a man always a

signallers&mdash;A crime and a visit to Hell&mdash;Barney and Mrs
I-ti&mdash;A skating civvie and a bandy batman.</p>

<p class="cp">(August&mdash;November 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p>Ted soon found his cadet-gained knowledge of signalling to be
very elementary, yet his experience in Morse and semaphore
"flag-wagging" was a good foundation for the more advanced
training.</p>

<p>He liked the sham stunts in which three signallers would be sent
out to man each visual signalling station. Sent out one day with
Jim J. in charge, and another signaller who, like Jim, was ever
ready to make way for youth when there was work to be done, Ted had
had about two hours' continuous flag-wagging when he received the
welcome message "emma-emma-esses" (M.M.S.)&mdash;meaning, "men may
smoke." Ted was about to light up when Jim said, "Did that message
say anything about boys may smoke."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Well, put your fag out."</p>

<p>Jim was promptly told to go to hell, but, being a good fellow
and always too tired to exert himself, just rolled over and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>An expert telegraphist, Jim considered that his effort towards
winning the war would be confined to his skilled calling, so,
except for taking part in route marches and in the general routine,
he was never known to work. He would come back merry from leave and
call out, "I've had two flounders, four bob each, and now I am
going to assert my prerogative. If there's a man amongst you let
him announce himself." One night someone did, but Jim only put out
his hand and said, "Well I'm (hic) glad to meet you; once a man
(hic) always a man (hic)&mdash;'ave a drink."</p>

<p>It was about this time that Alan L. ("Rubberneck") joined up
with the signallers. Detailed to Ted's tent, he could not
understand why all but one, Vic C., slept on one side of the tent.
"This'll do me," he said as he dumped his gear down alongside Vic,
but, having been kept awake all night with Vic's snoring, he woke
up to the idea. Vic was the grand champion of snorers, and even a
half-open box of matches lighted on his nose failed to cure
him.</p>

<p>Tom H., the corporal signaller, was also an occupant of this
tent. He took great pride in his hair and was most careful of his
personal appearance and effects. One Sunday, after leaving camp
with a lady friend whom he was taking to Sydney, he returned
hurriedly from Liverpool station looking the picture of misery.
During his absence Ted had found a pound note in the lines and,
saying "finding's keepings," had promptly visited the canteen and
also paid a deposit on his photograph. He was enjoying a good feed
when he was surprised to see Tom come back.</p>

<p>"What's up, Tom, had a row?"</p>

<p>"No, I've lost a quid."</p>

<p>"Struth! Tom, that's bad luck. Have a piece of cake?"</p>

<p>Bronchitis and meningitis were very prevalent at the camp at
this time, and Ted contracted the former complaint. The sergeant,
going on week-end leave, allowed Ted to sleep on his stretcher in
the store tent, and it was from there that Ted wrote home the
following letter:</p>

<p class="letter">DEAR MOTHER AND DAD,<br>
<br>
I am unable to come home this week-end as I have a bit of a cold.
It is nothing much, so don't worry. I am sleeping in the sergeant's
real bed in the store tent and will be well enough to go on parade
to-morrow.<br>
<br>
My bed faces the tent opening and I can see all the funerals that
go along the road from the hospital. The band plays the "Dead
March" with the drums muffled in black and the soldiers march with
reversed arms. They go by very slowly and the music makes me feel
as though I am in the funeral&mdash;I don't mean in the box. I
suppose in time we will get used to such sights.<br>
<br>
Toc R., the O.C.'s batman, went on leave to the country, and I am
supposed to take his place. I don't like the idea of being a
servant and cleaning boots, but suppose I'll have to do as I am
told. You should have seen Toc going on leave. He had infantry
breeches, light horse leggings and spurs he called 'ooks, a
coloured artillery sig.'s badge and two stripes on his arm, signal
corps badges on his shoulders, crossed flags in front of his cap, a
white naval lanyard sticking out of his pocket and rolled overcoat
across his chest, carrying a basket hold-all, signalling flags,
riding' whip and umbrella, and leading Tiny, our dog mascot, on a
piece of rope that kept getting tangled around his bandy legs. Toc
has flat feet, and Jack F. says he is built for trench warfare.<br>
<br>
I have had my photo taken and will send you one with this letter. I
will try and get leave on Thursday night and will come home to
dinner, and I would like you to make some sausage-rolls for me to
bring back to camp.</p>

<p>It is feared that Ted took good care to be a failure as a
batman. The light duties of this office, cleaning boots, polishing
leather and metal, making the bed, bringing shaving water, cleaning
up and folding up were more or less welcomed as a period of
convalescence, but both he and the O.C. rejoiced when Toc came back
to camp complete but for his umbrella.</p>

<p>During the month of September the battalion was transferred from
Liverpool to the Royal Agricultural Showground in Sydney. The
change was greatly appreciated by all ranks, for it brought the
city within easy distance of the camp. The made roads and grassy
training areas of the adjacent Moore Park were a decided change
after the sticky, oozing mud or thickly flying dust of Liverpool.
By this time, as a result of the training, and the issue of
uniforms and equipment, and of horses for the senior officers, the
mob had been converted into something approaching the appearance
and standard of an infantry battalion.</p>

<p>The 30th had for its colonel a tall and, but for a moustache,
most unwarlike-looking man with a highly pitched voice, who sported
a shrill pea-whistle. He lived with his bulldog in the show-ground
glass-house, and had for a batman an Englishman named Silvertail.
This man's name, when called by the colonel, was music in itself.
It was "Silvertail, Silvertail, how many more times am I to tell
you <i>not</i> to wrap my pyjamas in a wet towel?" Also
"Silvertail, I like my toast done a nice golden brown;" and, later,
in France, "Silvertail, there's a beastie on my singlet, take it
away from me, Silvertail, take it away!" But for all that, as the
real test of soldiering later proved, the colonel was a great
soldier; and it is doubtful if there was ever a more efficient
batman than his Silvertail.</p>

<p>Next in command was Major H., a thick-set, dinkum-looking major
with a florid complexion and suitable deep voice for giving
military commands, as well as expressive colour to his Aussie
vocabulary. He differed from the C.O. in every audible and apparent
respect, even to the shade of his khaki and the leather polish he
used. Later he was given command of another battalion.</p>

<p>With the leaders' contrasting qualities of ruggedness and
blandness more or less serving to compensate each other, the H.Q.
of the battalion also had an adjutant, one Captain S. A regular
soldier, senior in age and military experience, he gave balance to
the command and sympathetic understanding to those commanded.
Affectionately known as "Tod," his pecuniary lavishness recouped
more than one digger's loss at two-up, and at other times provided
the wherewithal for sight-seeing and various kinds of recreation in
Cairo and other pleasure resorts.</p>

<p>The battalion was divided into four companies, which in turn
were divided into four platoons each of four sections. Each company
and platoon had its O.C., and each O.C. had his peculiarities and
eccentricities. For instance, there was Major B. of A Company, a
crack rifle-shot, and known as "Cock Robin" for the one and only
song he gave at each battalion concert. Though at one time he had a
company of Queenslanders who proved as impossible for him to manage
as did their two mascot monkeys, his command now for the most part
comprised Victorian naval men from Williamstown. This change of
personnel he welcomed, but he found some difficulty in converting
them from naval to military practice. On one occasion Sergeant
Tosch reported as to so many being "aboard sir," the number "ashore
sir," and the names of those "adrift sir"&mdash;which, interpreted
with the retention of but one "sir," turned out to be a report on
the number in camp, on leave, and absent without leave
(A.W.L.).</p>

<p>In accordance with "establishments," the battalion absorbed
transport, machine-gun, and signalling sections, as well as a band
which, under the leadership of Sergeant Les W., had by this time
gained the reputation of being the best of its kind in Australia.
The 30th was thus as complete and evenly balanced as its brief
history and available equipment would permit.</p>

<p>The battalion's 1st Reinforcements joined the unit at the
showground. "Come on, brighten up and sing a song," said their O.C.
(Lieutenant Mac) when they were straggling along on a march. The
boys accordingly struck up "We'll Hang Old Macfarlane on the Sour
Apple Tree"&mdash;and that was the last time he called on them to
sing.</p>

<p>To celebrate and demonstrate its advent, the battalion, wearing
the latest type of equipment, made of green leather, and with its
accoutrements highly polished, marched through the streets of
Sydney. With the signal section leading, we fall into step with Ted
and share with him the countless thrills that travel up and down
his straight and youthful spine to the accompaniment of inspiring
martial music from the band.</p>

<p>By the time the marching column reached King Street Ted felt as
though he were walking on air. As it wheeled into George Street,
the sight of a girl falling from one of the top windows of a store
through the awning to the pavement below momentarily prompted him
to break from the ranks and run to her assistance. But though he
felt that as a participant in the march he was in some way
responsible for the accident, he carried on, and was brought back
to his bearings when an acquaintance on the sidewalk in Martin
Place advised him that he was the only one in step.</p>

<p>Stanley E., the youthful lieutenant in charge of the signallers,
was pinched in countenance and full of military theory; but,
despite his swanky little ways and schoolmaster attitude, was a
likeable chap. Instead of calling the members of his section boys
and treating them as men, he addressed them as men and tried to
manage them as school children. Military training and school
teaching were to him synonymous terms, and Sam C., a Cambridge
University graduate, took much delight in subjecting his newly
found tutor to humiliating ridicule.</p>

<p>Stanley took great pains to instil into his men that they were
the eyes and ears of the battalion, and, impressing upon them the
necessity of being observant in all things, he invited questions on
their observations. At one such question time Sam sought some
information.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "for some time I have been giving my utmost
concentration to a question not only of wide interest, but, might I
say, of vital importance to the battalion in regard to the holding
together of its command. With all the intelligence and power of
observation that I, like my fellow signallers, have acquired from
your teachings, sir, I regret to say that my research in the
subject has, owing to my humble status as a private, been
restricted, and I am unable to proceed to a definite determination
of the final phase. And now, sir, I respectfully seek your aid and
enlightenment, since you, as a commissioned officer of His Majesty
the King, and commanding officer of this intelligence wing of our
unit, are more favourably privileged to observe the finer points of
the subject, which to my mind is the mainstay of the battalion
command. Could you tell me, sir, if it is B.D. or D.V. corsets the
Colonel wears?"</p>

<p>When the laughter subsided Sam came in for severe reprimand and,
when the class was dismissed, he was given twenty alphabets to send
by Morse flag. Ted received similar punishment for being the most
outstanding with his laughter.</p>

<p>Sam, who liked to demonstrate his superior learning, wore
underneath the collar of his tunic a stiff white collar, the
feeling of which probably served to keep him from sinking into the
uncouth habits of a soldier. But at times he would get a little bit
rough and argumentative under the influence of higher class drinks,
which he was careful to talk of for fear one might presume he had
been partaking of common beer.</p>

<p>The signal section&mdash;excluding its sergeant and Toc R., the
O.C.'s batman&mdash;comprised twenty-three men. With three
signallers of the 1st Reinforcements, they were billeted in what
had been a furniture showroom, which was like a home away from
home, though without palliasses the floor was something of a
disadvantage. The front opened on to a veranda where a trestle
table served for taking meals, as well as for buzzer practice and
card games. It was not until the night before leaving these
premises that the erstwhile tenants discovered that gas was still
connected to a meter in the room, and, when the main pipe was lit,
the resultant five-foot flame served as a farewell beacon.</p>

<p>B., otherwise "Perlmutter," whose Yiddish cobber, Albert G., was
called "Potash," slept on a locker in one corner of the bare room.
One night, after they had returned from leave partly under the
influence and given an acrobatic display in the nude among the
rafters, Perlmutter sat fair in a bucket of water which had been
purposely placed on his locker.</p>

<p>Rex, Reg, and Peter were the reinforcement signallers, and, as
such, were looked upon by the originals as being below their
standard. This view had no real foundation, for the length of
service of these three was equal to that of the others, except Jack
F. and Tom H., who had seen "active" service in New Guinea. (Those
two, by the way, were wont to tell of the special service medal
that was going to be struck for that campaign.) It is doubtful,
however, if the reinforcement signallers ever felt any inferiority
in their position. They were morally, socially, and generally in
accord with each other, and, being so admirably suited, had no
occasion to consider this other "secondary" status. The foundation
of their friendship was, despite some difference in religious
creeds, based on their code of moral ethics. That they did not
adopt an attitude of aloofness, but joined in the collective
amusements of the section was an influence for their good as well
as for that of the others. It tended to broaden their outlook while
at the same time rounding off the rough corners of others, for, if
army life taught anything, it taught tolerance of the ways of
men.</p>

<p>Other signaller friendships were for the most part based on some
mutual characteristic or interest, yet the friendship of Eric W.
and Bill M. was at first hard to understand. The former was a
parson's son whose main interests lay in the direction of eating,
sketching and photography, while of Bill it was said that he was
writing a correspondence language course for bullock drivers; but
each soon became an apt pupil of the other and they were almost
inseparable.</p>

<p>Jim J. and Eric S., apart from being telegraphists by
profession, were also united in their ideas of recreation, and in
the art of elbow-bending they were about equal. Vic W. and Vic C.,
with names if nothing else in common, were also members of the
"bar," as were Potash and Perlmutter and, later, Eric W. and Bill
M. Alan L. (of furphy fame) was intelligence officer of the
froth-blowers' circle, while Barney K., an ex-lightweight champion
of the navy, was chief chucker-out and music maker.</p>

<p>Intellectual superiority and its finer tastes for both humour
and edibles brought Sam C. and Dud C. to a state of perfect
friendship, towards which Tom H. was ambitiously attracted and
admitted on account of his somewhat polished mode of speech. On
their returning to camp one evening Ted invited them to join him in
his supper of fish and chips and beer, and was severely crushed by
Sam's reply&mdash;"Fish and chips! Why we have just dined at Paris
House!"</p>

<p>C.C. being the code letters for the word "cipher" in the
signalling service, it was but natural that C.C.S. would be
nicknamed accordingly. Cipher was of an inventive turn of mind, and
at the time of his enlistment was in the midst of inventing some
patent kind of headlight that would automatically project round
corners. Jack G., an "umteenth" marine engineer, whose neat
appearance was his outstanding social qualification, proved a
suitable mate for Cipher. There was in the section another Jack G.
who, having been a senior clerk to Stan (the O.C.) in a shipping
office, apparently felt he had to keep up the dignity of his late
position by playing a lone hand.</p>

<p>Other members of the section included Ron C., a close friend of
the reinforcement signallers, yet even more adaptable than they
were to the social requirements of soldiering. He shared with Ted
the distinction of having a tunic embellished with officers'
embossed oxidized metal buttons, and was the owner of a safety
razor which Ted, receiving it as a parting gift, had exchanged with
him for ready cash. Then there was Reg H., whose twin brother was
on Gallipoli. Reg was another of the signallers' saints, and, when
provoked in excited argument, as was frequently the case, because
he was a good "bite," the only wickedness he was ever known to
utter was "Ah, me tit!" Bob T., according to the nautical
experiences he was ever ready to relate, was evidently born at sea,
where he must have lived for about eighty years to have travelled
so far and wide. Jim S. found pleasure in everything but shaving,
though he had a kit of six or more razors with which to attack his
wire-like growth; he was, without exception, the most obliging and
unselfish one of the crowd. Wal C. was unequalled for his dryness
of humour and his running capabilities, a most happy combination
which was to serve him well in France. What Mac M., a ginger-headed
Scotchman, lacked in humour he made up for in honesty; some ten
years after the war, he went to no end of trouble to locate one of
his Digger creditors with whom he insisted on settling a ten-bob
debt. In 1915, however, Ted was in Mac's black books for having
helped himself to the latter's gold-tipped cigarettes.</p>

<p>Ted had so far made no particular friend in the section, being
evidently satisfied to be one of the company and on good terms with
them all. His youth no doubt excluded his being welcomed into the
froth-blowing circle of the hard heads; and, as the company of the
wise heads would have cramped his style and made his youth more
apparent to himself, if not others, he&mdash;well, just carried
on.</p>

<p>One morning Ted was carrying on at the top of his voice, abusing
all and sundry, when Major H. came in hearing, and promptly crimed
him for using bad language. Ted was sorely tried all that day, and,
though he came in for a good deal of chaffing from his cobbers,
refrained from repeating anything of his morning address. Some told
him that he would be given No. 1 field punishment and lose at least
twenty-one days' pay, others that he would be "shot at dawn." He
found that night to be a very long one. The hard boards on which he
continually turned in trying to get to sleep were harder than ever
before, and when at last he did go off, it was only to dream of
even worse punishment than had been predicted by his mates. After
he had faced the firing squad and received its issue of lead, his
subconscious mind&mdash;taking a different course from that of most
dreams&mdash;went travelling on through hell, where the devil took
the form of the major who was gladly assisted in his tortures by
all the signallers, and to make matters worse, he had been struck
dumb. After ages and ages of continuous torture and just when he
felt that he was about to die again, he heard the sound of
Gabriel's trumpet, and awakening in a cold sweat, he found voice to
curse the long drawn out blast of Lofty B.'s trombone in the
adjoining shed.</p>

<p>Before the time arrived for orderly room parade, Ted paid an
unofficial call on the major, who was then dressing and had
evidently enjoyed a better night's rest than the lad, for, after
receiving an apology and advising him to refrain from using such
terms of "endearment," he withdrew the crime sheet. Ted, feeling
that officers were not such inhuman creatures as he had previously
imagined them to be, thereupon enjoyed a good breakfast and took
added interest in the work of the day.</p>

<p>That night he and other signallers went to the Union Jack Club
at Petersham. The club was run by a number of patriotic young
girls, whose sole object was to entertain anything filling a khaki
or naval uniform, and to send white feathers to those males who
preferred civilian dress. They gave freely of lemonade, cakes,
sweets, and kisses, and otherwise entertained with music, dancing,
and games. In return, they were entertained by the troops, of whom
Barney K. was their favourite with his sailor ditties, particularly
the one that went "I-tiddle-i-ti, one for Mrs I-ti, slap her in the
other eye," and so on. Barney, sitting on the floor among a bevy of
pretty girls joining him in song, laughed and joked and sang with
the same assurance that he had employed all the way out in the tram
when not otherwise engaged in argument with the conductor over the
troops' refusal to pay fares. "Book it up to Kitchener," he would
say, and would then go on with "Farmer Brown, 'e 'ad a little farm,
down on the E.I.O."</p>

<p>The roller skating rink at the Showground, opening as it did on
to the street and into the ground, provided a good avenue for those
taking and returning from French leave. It also afforded plenty of
opportunity to those who liked this form of thrilling recreation,
and furnished a handy, though in some cases last, meeting-place
with members of the opposite sex. A flash civilian, expert in the
art of skating, took much delight in upsetting the equilibrium of
the troops not so skilled as himself. Ted suffered several falls in
this fashion, and waited three successive nights before squaring
the account, almost breaking the civvie's neck. Barney's challenge
to a duel with or without skates was not accepted by the civvie,
nor was the floor of the rink afterwards graced by his
presence.</p>

<p>At this time the daily routine of the signallers commenced with
physical training, a break for toilet, breakfast, and dressing for
parade. Afterwards they would assemble with the rest of the
battalion on the ground at the rear of the skating rink, where
Major H.'s deep bass would bring the parade to order and he would
hand it over to the colonel, who with the aid of his pea-whistle
made himself promptly understood, despite his highly pitched voice
which gave much amusement to the troops. The battalion would then
get under way in its daily march to the foot of Mount Rennie, led
by the band playing its regimental march.</p>

<p>At Mount Rennie the battalion split up for either company or
platoon drill, while the band returned to camp to practise and the
signallers got on with their visual training, which sometimes took
the form of all-day stunts and resulted in their being spread out
over the landscape as far as the sand-hills of Botany. They also
had Morse buzzer practice and theory training, as well as
instruction in infantry manoeuvres and rifle drill.</p>

<p>One day when both the O.C. and the sergeant were away, Toc R.
led the signallers at the head of the battalion, as he was the
proud possessor of two stripes to which, by the way, he was not
entitled. Toc the batman had not previously been on a parade with
<i>the</i> 30th, and, had not the colonel been immediately behind
the signallers when Toc performed a fancy evolution with his
signalling flag as he wheeled into the street, the boys would have
all burst into laughter. Toc's left wheel resembled a tramwayman on
point duty eurhythmically posing as Mercury in search of somewhere
to go, and no doubt he was glad when his bandy legs and flat feet
eventually got him there.</p>

<p>When the battalion made arrangements to stage a military tattoo,
the signallers, because they were supposed to know something about
telephone wires, were given the job of erecting electric-light
poles in the show-ring, and for some years after the war these
stood as the only visible monument to their existence as a
unit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V. A SHIP SAILS</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Final leave&mdash;A
village party&mdash;The last night&mdash;Embarkation&mdash;Cheers,
shrieks and streamers&mdash;The Governor-General's furphy&mdash;The
Heads and a first cigar.</p>

<p class="cp">(November 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p>So congenial was the Showground camp, the spring weather, and
conditions of training interspersed with liberal leave, that the
two months preceding embarkation passed quickly, and during the
last few weeks of that period the troops went on final leave in
relays.</p>

<p>Ted, now a sun-tanned youth of five-feet-six and weighing ten
stone two, was in perfect condition, and in his khaki uniform
looked ready for the feast of Mars. His final leave was spent at
home, visiting and being visited by friends and relations the
majority of whom bored him stiff with their patronage and
well-meant words of advice. They all said how brave he was and how
well he looked; some asked him to kill a Turk for them, but most
wanted the life of some sausage-eating, barbarous German. All said
much the same things concerning his welfare welfare and safe return
to Australia, and asked him to write often and tell them about the
war. Then a final "Good luck," "God speed," or "Goodbye," along
with a shake of the hand or a pat on the back or a kiss.</p>

<p>Ted and his old school pal, Dab, were given a send-off by some
of the village boys and girls. Apart from the red, white, and blue
decorations, a bunch of Allies' flags with the Union Jack placed
upside down, and the uniform of the guests of honour&mdash;who
remained seated to their toast while the company sang "Australia
Will be There"&mdash;it was the usual merry party of youth as in
peace-time. Of course Ted and Dab received much attention from the
girls, who were ever ready to kiss and be kissed; but, as this
happened to be Ted's debut, he was rather shy. and did not warm up
to the idea until it was time to go.</p>

<p>He walked home with a buxom bunch of sweetness who, in that hour
of her hero worship, wanted more than the one kiss he gave her over
the garden gate, but Ted, like Ginger Mick&mdash;or was it the
Sentimental Bloke?&mdash;knew not what the 'ell to do with his two
hands. Yes, he agreed they should write to each other, and he
promised to keep her miniature photograph, which, by the way, was
resting in a silver match-box that kept company throughout the war
with the identification disk hanging against his chest from a piece
of string tied around his neck. On the way to his own home under
the stars of a cloudless sky, Ted meditated on the beauty of her
countenance and the warmth and brightness of her being, and,
imagining the sweetness of her presence still with him, decided he
was in love.</p>

<p>Mother and Dad, waiting up for his return, may have guessed
something of his feelings from the flush that penetrated his tan,
but any serious thoughts they may have entertained were quickly
relieved by the hearty manner in which he disposed of the dainty
supper Mother had prepared. He told them about the party, and was
saying something of the girl he had taken home, when Dad came to
his rescue and saved further explanation with the reminder that it
was long past time for bed.</p>

<p>His almost worn-out bicycle he handed over to the elder of his
two young brothers, but he put away other souvenirs of his youth,
such as his first suit of long-'uns, and his one and only school
prize (the inscription on the fly-leaf of which he glanced at with
a grin). The family having promised to visit him in camp on the
evening before embarkation, this made his leaving home more easy,
but more than once he looked back and wondered if he would ever see
the place again.</p>

<p>On the Sunday preceding departure Ted attended the battalion
church parade at St Andrew's Cathedral. Next day the unit was
paraded to hear the C.O.'s address to his officers and men, but
beyond the words "King and Country," "traditions," "duty," and
"victory," Ted heard little of that stirring speech, for he could
see his people on the "outer" waiting to say good-bye.</p>

<p>Mere words cannot adequately portray the emotional and touching
scenes of that evening, when over a thousand of Australia's manhood
parted, many for ever, from those they loved. Some walked With the
maidens they adored, no doubt whispering sweet vows of eternal
love. Some parted from mothers who held and pressed them to their
hearts again and again, and said nothing. Others parted from wives
sobbing in awful fear, some of them accompanied by children yet too
young to understand the tears. That rough old diamond Barney butted
in everywhere with his cheery laughter and happy songs, and, as Ted
and his mother broke their long embrace, Barney called, "Good-bye,
keep smiling, Mum!"</p>

<p>Ted's father was waiting at the gate of the camp when, at 4.45
a.m. on Tuesday, the 9th of November 1915, the battalion swung out
on what for many was to be their last march on Aussie soil. Many
members of the tramway volunteers, between whom and the 30th there
had been some unfriendly feeling, also gathered at the gate in
various stages of undress, many of them in bare feet, and they
cheered the departing troops in unison. One chap with a voice
reminiscent of a barracker's voice on the hill of the Sydney
Cricket Ground, was heard to ask that they leave him a few Turkish
tarts in the harem, and someone else advised suitable though
unmentionable treatment for the Kaiser.</p>

<p>When the battalion was marching at ease, Ted's dad, with one of
Ted's kit-bags under his arm, took the opportunity of having a few
last words with some of the signallers, and Ted would have been
greatly agitated had he known that Dad had confided his son's age
and a few other things to the O.C. As the column neared No. I wharf
at Woolloomooloo Bay, Dad again took his place alongside Ted, and,
as he hurriedly handed over the kit-bag, the youth saw, through his
own dim eyes, a tear on the strong yet smiling face of Dad, and
received, without any self-conscious feeling, the emotional kiss of
parting before he passed through those now historic gates to the
troopship.</p>

<p>After officials had checked up the embarkation roll and found
all present and correct, they ordered the disappointed section of
reserve men to return to camp, as there were no deserters' places
for them to fill. Then the troops filed up the gangway and boarded
the troopship A. 72. Breakfast of porridge and sausages was waiting
on the mess-tables as the signallers took up quarters underneath
the for'ard well-deck.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of doing justice to the meal when
Lieutenant Mac (O.C., 1st Reinforcements) discovered they had taken
the position allotted his men. As he stood there frowning like
fury, and with arms folded, Sam loudly asked Tom if he had ever
seen the famous picture of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, and
as Tom turned round to view the picture, Lieutenant Mac, red with
indignation, said to Sam: "Are you trying to be funny at my
expense?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir, I was merely referring to something of an historic
character," replied Sam.</p>

<p>"Because, if you are," continued Mac, "you'll find that I can be
much funnier at your expense." And, to the titter of subdued
laughter, he took himself off.</p>

<p>With breakfast disposed of, the signallers moved across to what
was the corresponding position on the right, or as Barney called
it, starboard side of the ship, and after being issued with
hammocks and rough, cream-coloured blankets, which they stowed in
bins, they were allowed to go on deck.</p>

<p>When at 8.30 the public, after two hours' enforced waiting,
surged on to the wharf, a great cheer went up from two thousand
khaki-clad figures who, swarming from mast-heads, rigging, and
railings, almost blotted out from sight the superstructure of the
ship. For the whole fifteen minutes preceding departure it was just
one long cheer, above which could be occasionally heard loud and
piercing shrieks of women, until finally the blast of the siren
announced that the ship was getting under way and the fussy little
tugs took charge of her. There was now a break in the cheering as
the band played "Auld Lang Syne." Thousands of multi-coloured
streamers, at first brightly waving, then slightly tugging, grew
taut and finally snapped to hang forlornly in the hands of those
who, now speechless, would for ever remember that day.</p>

<p>When the vessel pulled into mid-stream, the ferries greeted it
with shrill whistles of cock-adoodle-do. After the Governor-General
had given an inspiring address to the "gentlemen of the light horse
and men of the infantry," in which he dramatically mentioned they
were going on special service to a new front, Alan Rubberneck got
busy with his furphy wireless and gave it out that the Dardanelles
had been forced and they were bound to back up the Russian "steam
roller" via the Black Sea. A rumour from the aft latrine then had
it that Mesopotamia was to be their destination; and at dinner-time
there was much argument, which was only rivalled in importance by a
discussion on the merits of the menu.</p>

<p>Having waved to the fleet of launches grown dim in the distance,
and finally cheered the last cock-adoodle-do of a Manly ferry, the
ship passed through the Heads at three in the afternoon. At last
the long drawn out farewell had come to an end, and Ted, with
sickly grin and believing no one to be looking, dropped his first
but only half-smoked cigar over the side.</p>

and crown and anchor&mdash;A church parade&mdash;A dark horse and a

weevils&mdash;Suez.</p>

<p class="cp">(9 November&mdash;11 December 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p>Most Diggers sailed with a diary, few wrote them up. Ted's is
reproduced here.</p>

<p><i>H.M.A.T. "Beltana" (A.72). At Sea, Nov. 9th
1915.</i>&mdash;It has just gone 5 p.m., and according to the joker
in the crow's nest, gazing out to sea and not taking the least
notice of the chaps feeding the fishes&mdash;all's well. What with
the excitement of the day, that damned cigar I'd saved for the
occasion, and the sight of pickles on the mess-table for tea, it is
little wonder I'm not feeling too good myself. Anyhow, I'm not the
only one, and for that matter I guess the folk at home are feeling
a bit off their tucker too. My thoughts up to now are mostly about
what others are thinking, and I am worried about the sadness of
Mother and Dad at home. I feel sorry that I have caused them so
much trouble, but I am relieved to be at last on the way, for I
know now that they will not call me back. Barney has just informed
me he and I are mess orderlies for to-morrow, and, as the thought
of it makes me feel like showing visible signs of seasickness, I'm
going up on deck.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Nov. 11th.</i>&mdash;It is 8 p.m. and here we are
again. Some of the boys are playing banker at one end of the
mess-table, and a game of housie-housie is in progress on the hatch.
As mess orderly yesterday, I managed to dish up the boys' tucker
and keep mine down. It is rougher now, but I'm feeling better, so
don't suppose I'll be seasick after all. The daily routine,
according to orders, is to be: Reveille 6 a.m., physical jerks,
6.45 to 7.30, breakfast 7.45, parade 9.30 to 11.45 (with half an
hour smoko), dinner at noon, parade again 2 to 4 (with a quarter of
an hour smoko), tea at 4.30, and lights out at 9.15; no afternoon
duties on Saturday, and only physical drill and church parade on
Sunday. Counting church parade, because it is compulsory or
optional to peeling spuds, the actual working hours on this voyage
will total twenty per week with pay at the rate of two shillings
per hour; and as food, if you can eat it, is chucked in, a
soldier's life at sea in terms of .s.d. is not too bad. Of course
between parades there's always some fatigue duty to be done.</p>

<p>The hammocks, much more comfortable than bare boards, are strung
up over the mess-tables in formation, so that you have the heads of
two and feet of two other of your neighbours meeting on either side
about your middle. The lights go out, the latecomers scramble in
and are cursed for their bumps, someone sings a song and is told to
shut his bloody mouth, a smutty yarn brings wild laughter while the
wowsers go crook, and then, gently swaying to the motion of the
ship, we fall asleep. As the troops are packed like sardines above
the line of port-holes, the air becomes thick with the smell of
smoke and bodies; awakening with reveille, we hurry to the deck and
wait in long lines taking deep breaths of the fresh salt air, as we
push those in front and curse the slowness of the early birds, who
seem to have taken up permanent residence in the improvised and
much too small wash-houses and latrines.</p>

<p>After stowing hammocks and blankets, we eat some canteen
biscuits, and then a bout of boxing gives interest to the physical
jerks parade. Sitting on forms at the bare board mess-tables, we
await the orderlies, who come very carefully down the steep
companion-way, carrying porridge, stew or sausages, and dippers of
vile-tasting tea. We laugh as one of the orderlies, holding a dish
of stew with both hands, falls ace over head from half-way down the
steps, and we add insults to his injuries. Had it contained
sausages we could have picked them up, but Tiny, our mongrel
mascot, is already licking up the mess, and for us it only means
waiting a little longer, for, as lots are suffering from
seasickness, the galley has a surplus supply of food. Some; more
finnicky than others, just pick here and there at the food, while a
few, loudly complaining of the tucker, scoff it down their uncouth
necks at a rate that is only checked by their belching after long
gulps of the stinking tea.</p>

<p>The morning parade of the signallers if one is not detailed for
duty on the bridge, is taken on the boat-deck. The usual
flag-wagging and buzzer practice with the same old lectures will,
no doubt, be dished up to us time and time again. We have to speed
up the sending and reading of Morse to about thirty words per
minute on the buzzer, and as Jim and Joe can do about forty they
are marking time. Sometimes they talk to each other in Morse, and,
judging by their amusement and the few words I pick up, "indulge in
personalities," as Sam would say.</p>

<p>Each of the three courses of the midday meal tastes about the
same, but perhaps that is because the soup spoons and the fork of
the second course have to be used for the sweet. To-day's sweet
consisted of plum duff, which was promptly labelled
"guttapercha-pud," and, as (according to my dictionary)
gutta-percha is a reddish-brown horn-like substance of inspissated
juice of a certain tree, I reckon it's a good name. If the ship
gets torpedoed when the men are carrying a belly full of this tack,
they'll sink like stones.</p>

<p>This afternoon we had some instruction about the mercantile
international code. In between parades most of the boys play card
games and housie-housie, the latter being the only money game
allowed. The most enjoyable part of the day, however, if you don't
think of the good things they are eating, is the evening officers'
mess when the band plays selections. I have just returned from the
boat-deck, where, being alone, I feasted on the music, and, in the
fading light of the setting sun, let my mind wander back to the old
folk at home. Somehow I like the lonely feeling that comes over me
at sunset, but I must not mention this in my letters or they'll
think I'm homesick, which at this time of day, I truly am.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Nov. 12th.</i>&mdash;Did my turn at duty on the
bridge to-day, won 8/6 at banker&mdash;Barney says mugs for
luck&mdash;and bought a feed of tinned fish. The weather is very
rough and cold, so I am wearing my sheepskin vest for the first
time. The officers have just finished dinner; I enjoyed it, I mean
the music part, very much. There's a chap inviting all and sundry
to try their luck at his crown-and-anchor board. "Come on, come on,
stick it on, where you like and where you fancy, who'll have a bit
on the ol' 'ook?" So here goes, I'll give it a fly.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 14th.</i>&mdash;It rained last night, and today
is very cold and rough. Had another win at banker yesterday, but
fell for the crown and anchor stunt again and am now down a few bob
on the trip. Somehow I can't enjoy a smoke. Attended C. of E.
church parade on the well deck this afternoon. The chaplain
addressed us about the purpose of our mission in the cause of
righteousness, and said that God, being ever just and merciful,
would lead us to victory in this war to end wars for evermore. He
made me feel glad that I am on the winning side&mdash;not that I
have ever felt otherwise&mdash;and some of us, forgetting it was a
church parade, began to clap. There where prayers for the Allies,
the loved ones at home, and for forgiveness of the enemy. The
service&mdash;with the hymns "Eternal Father," "Onward Christian
Soldiers," and Kipling's "Recessional"&mdash;was most impressive,
and concluded with the National Anthem.</p>

<p>Found out to-day that if you are in the know and have a few bob
for a steward, you can get a hot bath and decent cup of tea, so I
had both and a piece of toast as well. And now, having been to
church, had a bath and a clean cup of tea, and written home, I feel
at peace with the world, so will turn in.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Nov. 15th.</i>&mdash;There's no change in the
weather, the tucker, or the routine, and, as land or ships have not
been sighted, I'm feeling fed up. Someone has told the O.C. my age,
but, judging by his wink when he took me to task about it, I don't
think he'll put me away. He probably remembers the night at the
Showground when I overheard him taking a lingering farewell of
"Babby"&mdash;she called him "Tanny." I was up on one of the tank
stands feeding some fresh leaves to our native bear, and they were
immediately underneath, until I disturbed them with an excellent
imitation of a cock-crow. Yes, I think he will keep my secret, and
Barney reckons it will be all right.</p>

<p>Fell down the blasted steps to-day, and, as I was bending down
to get a view of my bruise in a polished steel mirror, someone
squirted it with a mouthful of water. That's his idea of a
joke&mdash;the dirty cow. Don't feel like sitting down any longer,
so am going for a walk with Barney to get a drink of fresh air
before turning in. The crown-and-anchor king has been put in clink
for getting drunk. The whisky cost him about 2 a bottle, and
Barney reckons he'd give a fiver for one now.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Nov. 16th.</i>&mdash;The weather to-day has been
calm, warm, and bright, and, except for my sore nether end, I'm
feeling good-oh. The early morning topic of conversation was a
review of what we were doing at that time a week ago&mdash;marching
down to the transport. And then, at the same hour as leaving
Sydney, we passed the hospital ship <i>Kyarra</i> homeward bound
with wounded. Painted all white and flying a Red Cross flag she
looked very nice, and I suppose those poor chaps on board are
feeling very excited and happy at seeing the Aussie coast, at King
George's Sound, which has just faded from our vision. I believe we
expected to feel like different beings once the ship sailed, but
after a week at sea we have come to realize ourselves as being
little changed. The sight of the hospital ship has established our
bearings&mdash;we have got a long way to go.</p>

<p>To return to the present&mdash;what is there to growl about?
Only that something has gone wrong with the latrine just above our
mess-deck and, as the filthy overflow would come through the
port-holes, we have to keep them shut. It will be pretty rotten
sleeping here to-night, so I think I'll go with Barney who has
taken up lodgings on some bales down in the hold below.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Nov. 17th.</i>&mdash;Sleeping down here has its
disadvantages. We both slept in, missed the last sight of Aussie at
6.30 a.m., and got into trouble for being late on parade. Our bikes
are stowed in this hold, and as there is plenty of room, we
practise trick riding. This possie is below the water-line, and it
gets a bit depressing in the dim yellow light of a few small
electric globes. If anything goes wrong while we are down here I
wonder if we'll hear. Must ask someone up top to give us the office
if the alarm goes. A boxing match on the fore hatch this afternoon
only lasted two rounds. But for the advice the spectators kept
shouting, it was most uninteresting. The ship has taken to rolling
instead of pitching, but otherwise things are much the same.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Nov. 18th.</i>&mdash;We are in the Indian Ocean and
have to-day been shown our lifeboat and raft positions. Machine-gun
positions have been fixed, and the best rifle-shots have also been
detailed to act in the event of a submarine attack. I find myself
almost wishing that a submarine would pay us a visit, and my
thoughts have gone so far as to picture the signal section afloat
on a raft, with O.C. Stan giving us physical jerks and complaining,
as he does now, about our inability to remain steady despite the
changing of the centre of gravity. It is a change to think of what
might happen but I don't suppose anything half so interesting will
come our way. In fact I am afraid we will be stiff enough to arrive
too late for the war. It being our tenth day out we had a medical
parade to-day, a most amusing affair, except for a few who have
been isolated.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Nov. 19th.</i>&mdash;Same old routine. Weather
getting hot and sea very calm. Had life-belt drill this morning,
and someone remarked that Jim J. looked like a native bear in the
family way.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Nov. 20th.</i>&mdash;Washing clothes, boxing, and a
tug-o'-war has been the programme this afternoon. Wish I could use
my fins a bit better, but according to Barney I'm not the worst
boxer on the boat. Barney has a long skinny chap in secret
training, who is as slow with his fists as he is in waking up to
the leg-pulling stunt. We rub him down with rough bags and
engine-oil, and have him running round our hold for hours on end
while we play cards. He has just come back for more and wants to
know if he should enter for the heavy or lightweight championship
of the boat, but Barney advises him to remain a dark horse, as
indeed he will for many a day because we are gradually increasing
the proportion of lamp-black in the engine-oil.</p>

<p>Heads to be shaved and upper lips to be left unshaved is the
latest King's Regulation. Reg H. up to now has not broken one of
the King's Regulations, but refuses to have his wool off. "It's a
fair cow," he protests. The boys have grabbed him and have run one
bald stripe from his forehead to the back of his neck. Poor old Reg
is going crook a treat, but as he does not swear he can't get
anyone to believe that he really wants the job finished. He'll be
the goat on the altar at church parade to-morrow, and in a week's
time I'll be the kid without a mo. It is time to go to the concert,
the first on board I wonder what it will be like?</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 21st.</i>&mdash;The concert was a great success.
Major B. sang every verse of "Who killed Cock Robin," and one of
the chaps, a born mimic, imitated everyone of any importance. He
gave us the Governor-General's speech and took Major H. off to a
"t." The boat rocked with laughter when he imitated the colonel and
his funny whistle. The colonel, however, failed to see the joke and
did not move a muscle or turn a hair of his so far un-bald head.
Did not go to church parade this morning; was spud barber
instead.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Nov. 22nd.</i>&mdash;Inspection by the colonel of the
morning's full-dress parade was followed by a tug-o'-war between
the light horse and our officers, who won both ways. The weather
now being tropical, awnings have been placed over the bridge and
decks and most of us have cut our dungarees down to shorts. A
canvas swimming-bath has been erected on the well-deck and an
officer and several N.C.Os have been ducked fully dressed. One of
the chaps has a hunt scene tattooed on his back, but as the fox is
hopping into its hole you can only see its tail. The ocean is a
beautiful blue to-day, and is only broken by the bow of our ship
where I have spent a few hours sun-baking and looking at the
flying-fish.</p>

<p>Reg has the hair off one side of his head now, and as he is
beginning to froth at the mouth I think it's time to finish the
job, so have invited him down here. As Barney shaves Reg's head and
shouts encouragement to Puglongun who in his oiled nakedness is
running the meat off his bones, this dismal hole looks like a
rat-house.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Nov. 23rd.</i>&mdash;Ron and I slept on deck last
night, and the wind having changed we woke up to laugh at each
other's faces covered in soot from the funnel. There has been a
slight improvement in the food to-day&mdash;yesterday's was rotten.
On my way to the boat-deck this evening I had a look at the
officers feeding. The port-hole did not permit a full view of the
performance, but I saw sufficient to convince me that at least a
few know more about swinging a walking-stick than of wielding a
knife, fork, and spoon. To one who tipped his soup plate the wrong
way I felt like shouting, "When in doubt wait for the roll of the
boat." I wish they would give me the job of teaching them table
etiquette by numbers, or the post of taster would suit me as well.
Food seems to be the principal subject of my diary, and so it
should be, for did not some general say, "An army marches on its
stomach." That may be so, but it seems to me that, apart from "the
heads," this battalion sails on its wind. The evening band
programme was, as usual, the most enjoyable event of the day.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Nov. 24th.</i>&mdash;Owing to shortage of fresh
water, steam has had to be diverted from the engines to the
condensers, and our speed has been slowed up.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Nov. 26th.</i>&mdash;Some of the chaps are
continually scribbling. It beats me what they find to write about.
Sam only draws sixpence a day and has everything worked out, even
to the number of words he can write with an ink tablet. Wish this
war was a bit nearer. Think I'll chuck up writing this diary until
we arrive at the Big Smoke. It's about time we got some pay as I
have spent nearly all my money except a pound I lent to Potash, who
is running a banker school and has promised me a fiver if it turns
out all right.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Nov. 27th.</i>&mdash;What the eye doesn't see the
heart doesn't grieve for, but, when you see maggots dropping from
the seams of the bench where they cut up the meat behind the
latrine, it reminds you there's only one thing worse than eating a
grub and that's finding you have only eaten half of one. While
others ate roast meat, Barney and I shared a tin of canteen
tongues, and we were enjoying the issue of stewed dried-fruit when
someone discovered the ground-rice-looking-substance to be weevils.
Then the orderly officer came, and was greeted with song: "We don't
want your apples, we don't want your apples, we don't want your
apples, you can&mdash;" He agreed we had cause for complaint and
mounted the stairs while the mob sang, to the tune of a bugle call,
"Officers' wives have puddings and pies, but sergeants' wives have
skilly; the dirty old cook he fell in our soup and burnt the skin
off his belly." While some bandsmen played the "Dead March," mess
orderlies, carrying dishes of stewed apples, led a "funeral" parade
along the promenade deck.</p>

<p>So what we missed in nourishment, if any, we made up for in
merriment, and some of the chaps suggested going on strike. Any
strike other than a hunger strike would of course be mutiny on the
high seas, and, though it was difficult to see how we could all be
put in clink, the idea was ruled out. A boxing match that looked
like providing the material for a real burial at sea came to an end
when the prospective corpse's second threw in the towel at the end
of the second round.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 28th.</i>&mdash;I don't know why, but for the
first time in my life I have experienced the feeling of being
uplifted from the state of self-consciousness that I have always
felt in church. It was not because of anything in particular that
the chaplain said&mdash;he, the officers, and we men were as
one&mdash;but it seemed that the sky, the ocean, the breeze, and
our singing were all sublimely blended in one beautiful presence.
One does not discuss the spiritual with one's fellow men, but I am
sure that they all equally feel, not the service, but the Presence.
The service was but the medium that brought us together, and now
that the chaplain and officers have returned to their saloon and we
to our lesser quarters, I feel that we remain spiritually united in
this great adventure of life. Life, as I see it, is like looking
with envious and critical eyes through the port-hole of the
officers' mess on one's way to view and enjoy the beauty and
restfulness of the sunset. In time perhaps I might earn my place in
that mess, but meantime I can share with them the sweet music of
the spiritual life. That material life is one damn thing after
another is true enough, but the thing to remember is that there is
always something good. Must make a note in my diary twelve months
hence to remind me of this day, for I might never again have the
inspiration for such deep thought.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Nov. 29th.</i>&mdash;Went on parade this morning with
a false mo. and got told off. Father Neptune and his retinue of
roughs came on board last night. Heralded by bugle, cornet, and
trombone artists, all playing independently, and followed by other
instrumentalists playing likewise, Father Nep., Mrs Nep., their
chucker-out, slaves, and mermaids, together with a blanket elephant
that had swallowed two men,: paraded the decks and gave us ten
minutes' amusement before lights out. So that we might attend
Neptune's court, this afternoon was proclaimed a holiday. From my
high position on one of the derrick booms overlooking the well-deck
I had a good view of the amusing proceedings, and was safe from
being shanghaied into it. As each victim sat on the seat of
initiation the barber's naked nigger offsider swiped him over both
cheeks with a soap-sudded whitewash brush, and then the barber
shaved him with two mighty sweeps of his immense wooden razor and
knocked him rotten with a crack under the chin into the canvas tub
where several willing slaves proceeded to try and drown him. So
that's the delightful ceremony of crossing the line. For a while
the "old timers" had it on us until the show ended with Nep. and
Co. being thrown into the bath and forced to swallow much of its
contents.</p>

<p>Crossing the line has brought the signallers some new work. We
start off to-night by getting familiar with the stars of the
northern hemisphere&mdash;Charlie Chaplin, Flora Finch, John Bunny,
etc.&mdash;in case during our future nightly wanderings we want to
locate the direction of the poles.</p>

<p>Drew a pound's worth of my eighteen-pence-a-day allowance
yesterday, and proceeded to do it in at banker, but my luck changed
for the better, and I'm now well in funds. It gives one a feeling
of some contentment to have a well-filled money-belt rubbing
against one's less contented tummie.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Nov. 30th.</i>&mdash;The machine-gunners had some
practice shooting at empty cases floating in our wake. A lecture
about Egypt, the customs of the people, and the precautions to be
taken against venereal disease, was, though more to the point, much
about the same as I have already heard. It seems that there's more
than one fly in the milk and honey pots of Egypt, and we have
formed the impression that prostitution is the principal occupation
of the female inhabitants, and its sexual side the only
sight-seeing attraction. All this talk has made me curious, but I
have decided that such forms of recreation are not for me. Two
members of the crew have been convicted of stealing money-belts,
etc., from the troops. The world does not seem such a beautiful
place to-day.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Dec. 1st.</i>&mdash;One long growl about the food.
Complaints brought forth an issue of jam and a promise that things
will be looked into.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Dec. 2nd.</i>&mdash;Slight improvement in the food.
It is getting hotter every day. Sighted land at 5.30 this evening,
otherwise nothing to report.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Dec. 3rd.</i>&mdash;Had kit-bag inspection to-day. We
continue towards the war at the hair-raising speed of ten knots,
and all's well.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Dec. 4th.</i>&mdash;Passed the Island of Perim and
about half a dozen ships to-day. The shores of the Red Sea are
rugged and barren. The white buildings of the port of Mocha made a
pretty picture and its isolation caused one to wonder why it was
there.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 5th.</i>&mdash;Church parade cancelled owing to
intense heat. Passed several ships, one with Indian troops on
board, signalling us good luck. A storm commencing with a terrific
thunder-clap put the wind up the boys, who rushed up on deck. All
letters have to be handed in for censoring to-day, and we have been
instructed not to write too much.</p>

<p>[Ted's letters home, complaining only of the elements beyond the
control of man, such as the heat of the tropics and cold of the
Australian Bight, gave the impression that he was enjoying a
holiday cruise with a company of missionaries. He concluded his
loving wishes and reassuring statements as to the cleanliness of
body and state of mind with the usual phrase, "I am having a good
time."]</p>

<p><i>Monday, Dec. 6th.</i>&mdash;Paid ten bob. Paraded stewed
peaches garnished with maggots before the colonel, who has
instructed someone to look into it. We would like to have the
pleasure of the company of the merchant who supplied the fodder for
this trip.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Dec. 7th.</i>&mdash;We have paraded in full marching
order and are all bucked up at the prospect of arriving at Suez in
the morning.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Dec. 8th.</i>&mdash;We gave a good old cheer as
the <i>Beltana</i> at 8 a.m. dropped anchor in the port of Suez,
where about fifty other merchant ships, now mostly acting as
troopers, and two warships make an impressive scene. Hundreds of
natives in boats of all descriptions are making a bee-line for our
ship, and, as lots of the boys are getting the hoses ready and
arming themselves with spuds, I can see some fun within the next
few minutes. The banker business of Potash &amp; Co. has turned out
all right for Potash but not so good for the Co. Potash is a Yid,
and as he paid me principal and 200 per cent interest he told me I
could have the three balls from above his door.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Dec. 11th.</i>&mdash;It has just gone 9 a.m. and we
are at last drawing into the wharf. Of course there has been much
disappointment and growling over the delay in disembarkation, but
the last few days have not been without amusement. The Gyppo
hawkers&mdash;mostly dressed in white, but not snow-like, flowing
garments, and wearing various kinds of head gear including the red
fez&mdash;have up to now attracted most of our attention. This
attention has not always been to the Gyppo's liking. He has been
beaten down in his prices, pelted with spuds and abused, but,
having no self-respect, keeps coming back for more. His wares
consist of postcards and souvenirs of Egyptian crafts, which I am
told are mostly made in Birmingham and India. Then there are figs,
dates, Turkish delight, oranges, and hard boiled eggs they call
"eggs-a-cook." A couple of fortune tellers compete and try to outdo
each other in predicting most marvellous good fortunes and victory
for us in war.</p>

<p>Like the lady who when shown an oil-painting said "What a
beautiful frame," I like the picture of Suez best when it is framed
in the darkness of night. Then the inquiring searchlights of
warships, a steamer coming slowly through the Canal and the sound
of Eastern music stealing over the waters, transform this otherwise
uninteresting place into an enchantment of ever-changing, brilliant
illumination, twinkling lights, silhouettes and reflections of the
low-lying hills and the city and ships in port.</p>

<p>Boat racing in the ship's lifeboats has afforded recreation to
some of the boys; but without exception we are itching to get
ashore and, according to all accounts, we shall be itching when we
get there.</p>

<p>When at last the pilot came alongside, we, being ignorant of his
official mission, presented him with the usual spray of spuds,
which forced both him and his officer to leave the tiller and seek
shelter in the cabin of their launch. The launch shot aimlessly
here and there until it had received the last of the potatoes, when
the pilot, with as much dignity as his smashed fez would permit,
came aboard.</p>

<p>The wharf-labouring natives go easy with their work. They do it
to music, or, rather, to a monotonous chant in which they all join
"Ee-ar-ee-ar, ar-ar-ee-ar" and so on with much hand-clapping. The
boss Gyppo carries a stick and when he has occasion to use it, as
is often the case, all the other Gyppos knock off work to laugh at
their less fortunate comrade. Seems to me there's good scope for a
union secretary here and an employers' organization would also be
an advantage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. TOURING AT SIX BOB
A DAY</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Tod and a case of
eggs&mdash;A guide and a steam-roller&mdash;Heliopolis to
Cairo&mdash;Morning tea, the Wazir and a donkey ride&mdash;A cycle
trip and orders to move to the front.</p>

<p class="cp">(12 December-15 December 1915)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 12th.</i>&mdash;We disembarked at 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and immediately entrained, and travelling via
Helmieh, arrived at the Aerodrome Camp, Heliopolis, at 2.30 this
morning. The journey was almost without incident. For a time after
leaving Suez we travelled through flat desert country studded with
a few palms and some flat-roofed mud dwellings. The train swayed,
jolting and creaking onward into the night, and I soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>It must have been about midnight when I awakened to the babel of
Gyppos crying their wares, and particularly to the shouting in my
ear of one of them: "Oringies, oringies, two for half." Looking
down I helped myself to one of his juicy oranges, and as he grabbed
my wrist I used my free hand to upset his basket&mdash;and that's
where the fun began. The boys, looking for some excitement, tossed
the loudly protesting niggers out on to the platform and then,
commandeering a case of eggs, chased and pelted them out into the
desert until their ghostlike figures melted into the night. The
engine whistle was the signal for us to return, and we found the
adjutant in heated debate with the station-master, who was
demanding payment for the case of eggs before he would allow the
train to proceed. Tod paid him a sovereign. The station-master came
back for more. Tod gave him another, but the stationmaster was
still not satisfied. "Come on, don't hold the war up," someone
shouted. Tod paid out a third sovereign, the word of reprimand was
passed along, and we settled down once more.</p>

<p>On arrival at Helmieh we set out with a guide for our camp.
After marching for what seemed like hours, we passed for the third
time a wayside steamroller, whereupon the guide, questioned,
admitted he must have taken a wrong turn. In full marching order
and in bad nick, and with tempers on edge, we were silently
tramping past a village when a dog barked and Rubberneck's command
of "Lay down Watercan!" put us in good humour again.</p>

<p>While we were standing at attention in front of our tents at 3
o'clock in the morning, and waiting for God knows what, our O.C.
asked the major: "Could I have an extra tent for stores, sir?"
"Damn the stores," was the reply, "Get your men to bed."</p>

<p>From here the camp appears to extend for a couple of miles along
the foot of a sandy slope that gently rises to the town of
Heliopolis. It is a bell-tent encampment with a number of large
matting huts for mess purposes.</p>

<p>Except for a darkie having just been upended into his crate of
doughnuts, and liberally sprinkled with icing sugar, there's
nothing to report.</p>

<p>Hurrah! Here goes, it's 10 a.m. and we have leave for the
day.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Dec. 13th.</i>&mdash;The letterhead of the Y.M.C.A.
where I am writing portrays a scene with a palm grove and
18-pounder gun in the foreground and the Sphinx and Pyramids in the
distance. If coloured, probably it would be of vivid yellows and
greens with a blazing red sunset, like the pictures of Egypt one
sees in the shops, but in reality not resembling that of the
landscape. Perhaps my eyes have been dimmed to the beauties and
wonders of this country, for my travels so far have not taken me
beyond its man-made sordidness, though I must admit having seen
something more than the Wazir. It is because of my shame at the
degrading sights I have voluntarily witnessed, and, I confess,
their humorous entertainment, that I have refrained from recording
my experiences of yesterday. I might well pass over this period,
but the recording of it will probably do me good, reopening my mind
and dimmed eyes to the commonplace things of Egypt which, if not
beautiful, will be so by contrast with what I have so far seen. And
now to return to yesterday.</p>

<p>Approaching Heliopolis we, five in number, were besieged by the
welcoming natives with whom we exchanged our Australian money for
96 piastres to the pound, and then purchased stout cane
walking-sticks with which we proceeded to clear the way. Heliopolis
we found to be a modern town of broad streets, extensive squares,
and attractive architecture. The buildings, mostly white, appear to
have been built within the last ten years, but not having time to
make inquiry we proceeded on our way.</p>

<p>Following the main stream of Aussie traffic, we came to the
centre of the town and boarded the tram for Cairo. On the southern
outskirts of the town the tram, a most modern and comfortable
conveyance, runs on to a railway track and does the four miles to
Cairo at a speed of some fifty miles an hour alongside a straight
and charming avenue of trees.</p>

<p>Here we were given another reception by some hundreds of the
population, all of whom have something to beg or sell, and again we
got busy with our sticks. We were continually being met and
followed by vendors of cigarettes, post-cards, bead necklaces, and
silks, loudly praising their wares, but we endeavoured to keep on
the move, for to stop meant having a howling and fighting mob of
boys at our feet screaming "Dinkum Kiwi, Mister MacKenzie, polishum
bootsa quick." A crying boot boy tearfully wailing "Soldier kicka
da gutza bootsa" immediately turned off the tear-tap as he received
our sympathetic <i>baksheesh</i> piastres.</p>

<p>We thought of morning tea, but on entering an Italian caf
decided to have a feed. Barney ordered the tucker regardless of
expense. "Who'll have some more turkey?" he called. "We all will,"
was the reply, and Barney followed the waiter to the kitchen from
which he returned with a roast turkey complete. While arguing with
the proprietor, he pro-ceded to cut up and dish out the bird, but
the Dago was not satisfied until we each paid fifty piastres on
account. We had some more beer, a smoke, and a song. Some Tommies
gathered at the open door and gaped at us, and the Dago again got
restless, but we carried on until we had our fill and then set out
in quest of adventure.</p>

<p>Hunger satisfied, and radiant with beer, we somehow felt well
disposed towards the natives as they pestered us on our way, and as
we passed Shepheard's Hotel, reserved for officers, we felt not the
least bit envious.</p>

<p>There was an abrupt change in our surroundings as we left the
Sharia Kamel and entered the native quarter, with its narrow
winding streets lined with squalid looking houses, in a state of
crumbling decay. A veteran pointed out the scene of the battle of
the Wazir, and told us why and how they set fire to the place, cut
the fire hoses into handy lengths and used them to knock the Gyppo
police off their horses. He told us where we can buy photos of the
battle and showed us some examples of lewd photography procurable
at the same place. Though we had no desire to possess such vile
rubbish, we were determined to see for ourselves the subjects of
the pictures and the stories we had heard.</p>

<p>Laughing and joking about the almost naked women who beckoned to
us as they suggestively strutted up and down the balconies, we
passed on into the wickedly pulsating heart of the Wazir. Here we
found a soldier trying to drag his drunken mate away from the
entrance to a brothel, in front of which its commissioner was
pointing in turn to each of the painted objects of his
stock-in-trade, and saying "Quice kateer, verra nice, verra clean;"
but, apart from the drunk, no one took him seriously and he ducked
just in time to avoid an over-ripe orange which went squash against
the wall.</p>

<p>"This way to Fark Moy's," someone called out, but instead of
going there we entered a doorway and went carefully up several
flights of steps, paid two piastres and were admitted to a room
bare of furniture and with a dried-mud floor. Some were given
lighted candles to hold and as soon as a sufficient number were
present to form a khaki dado round the walls, a black girl entered
and, discarding her shawl, revealed, but for the snake tattooed on
her belly, complete nakedness. She danced the can-can, did
evolutions with a cigarette, and then took up a collection that was
to be shared with a Gyppo policeman, who also stripping off did his
stunt while the boys spilt hot candle-grease on him. As we passed
out of the room and down the dark steps, I was no longer able to
contain myself, and vomited, only to be cursed by the chap in
front. But he had not counted on Barney, who swore it was he who
was sick, and so, as the waiting troops went up for the next
session, we passed on.</p>

<p>Barney felt sorry for me, for he understood why I was sick, but
I insisted that the turkey had upset me and joked about the
performance we had just seen. We found our way to the Y.M.C.A. in
Esbekia Gardens, had a wash and settled down in easy chairs. I was
soon sound asleep. Awakening I found Barney still with me, but the
others had gone, so the two of us had afternoon tea and decided on
a donkey ride through the bazaars.</p>

<p>Astride our donkeys, both called Moses, away we went. There was
no chance of pinching off with the donks, or for that matter
guiding them where we wanted to go, for they obey every word of the
donkey boys, who shout as they follow up behind. Dodging through
the busy traffic of the main streets we turned off into the bazaar
and as we wended our way along the dirty unpaved narrow lanes the
sound of wheeled traffic quickly died away.</p>

<p>Here the tall houses on either side with overhanging balconies
almost meet above the heads of the traffic, and as we picked our
way among the camels, donkeys, and pedestrians we had time to gaze
at the shops opening on to the streets. These, some of them little
more than cubby-holes in the ground floors of the houses, display
all manner of goods out on to the street. The natives work at their
various trades and the hammering of the tinsmiths and brass-workers
now and then rises above the babel of the swarming populace. We saw
a tailor squatting over his work at the opening of his cubby-hole,
also carpet makers, shoe makers, purveyors of food and drink and
silks and all manner of Oriental trappings and tapestries, and
Barney upset a nigger who was carrying a tray of pastry-looking
stuff on his head. We passed a mosque, its beauty standing out in
contrast to the squalid surroundings, and from its lofty minaret we
heard the wailing of a priest calling to his God. A tall veiled
Egyptian mother carrying a babe upon her shoulder looked at us with
large dark eyes peering from either side of a gilt cylinder worn on
her nose. She was accepting a brass pannikin of drinking water from
an aged Egyptian who carried a goatskin water-bag over his
shoulder. Suddenly we came out on to a main street again, and found
that our trip had been a round one, for we were back in Opera
Square. The donkey boys had received payment in advance, but we
tipped them well for their run, and returned to the Y.M.C.A. for
more tea.</p>

<p>Wandering around Cairo we found amusement everywhere. Then
remembering we were not tourists, we made our way back to camp,
meeting on the way the same black boot-boy crying "Soldier kicka da
gutza bootsa" but this time he gets only a <i>baksheesh</i>
boot.</p>

<p>To-night Barney and I are resting at the Y.M.C.A. in Heliopolis
since having an early tea in this town. We have applied for
half-day leave to-morrow, and intend going for a tour on our
bicycles to have a look at the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the Citadel
and such places that others have visited while we were underground.
Barney has just been trying to decipher my notes of yesterday, and
he informs me I've got a head like a fowl ("good at picking things
up") but why I want to scratch about it he fails to understand.</p>

<p>Had the usual camp drill to-day, and now it is time to be
getting out of town.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Dec. 15th.</i>&mdash;We have received orders to
proceed to the front to-morrow. "Verra good news, to-morrow's
paper," as the Gyppo paper boys say. From what I can gather we are
going into the Sinai desert to defend the Suez Canal against the
Turks, who are expected to attack again. Our leather equipment has
been condemned, and we are to be issued with web equipment, new
rifles and ammunition to-morrow.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cycle trip will ever remain fresh in my memory. It
was a most interesting one, and as I have an hour to spare before
returning to camp at 9.30 p.m. I'll jot it down.</p>

<p>We had lunch in Heliopolis and then, keeping to the right of the
road, pedalled into Cairo. Here we visited the European or Ismailia
quarter of the city, and its picturesque Esbekia Gardens. Outside
the post office, quite a modern building, we saw a number of
scribes squatting at their little desks writing letters for the
natives, the great majority of whom are unable to write. After our
Sunday trip it was a pleasure to view the broad avenues of the
European quarter where live the higher class Egyptians and other
nationals, mostly French. Some of their homes are like palaces,
with beautiful gardens and spacious courtyards. The homes of the
Egyptians may be distinguished from those of the others by the
carved wooden screens to the windows of the harems. The Egyptian
women of this quarter wear thin white veils through which you can
almost see their features, and, as their noses are not ornamented
with gilt cylinders, you get a better look at their wondrous deep
dark eyes&mdash;but not for long.</p>

<p>We also visited Gezireh, an island in the Nile, where most of
the British population reside. From here the Nile, with its busy
traffic of small boats with tall sails, and Cairo, with minarets,
mosques, and white and yellow buildings in the background, make a
most pleasant scene.</p>

<p>Standing at any one of the three bridges which span the Nile,
one sees all manner of human life, as well as conveyances and
animals, go by. On one cart&mdash;just a platform on two wheels
with a single donkey in the shafts&mdash;I counted five
black-veiled and hooded wives and six children, farmer Abdul
walking alongside clad in flowing white garments. Then by way of
contrast, a carriage drawn by two well groomed horses flashed past;
a long string of camels padded silently over the bridge; army
service wagons and lorries rattled along; a buffalo and herd of
goats held up the traffic. Then we caught a glimpse of some
Australian nursing sisters returning from the Pyramids in a car,
while black, white, and brindle, civilians and soldiers (Tommy, New
Zealand, Indian and Australian) thronged back and forth.</p>

<p>An early tea and away we went out of Cairo to a native village
where, I am afraid, our arrival upset the peacefulness of its
inhabitants. The women turned their heads away, the children and
barnyard fowls raced helter skelter into the hovels, and a camel
regarded us with a most suspicious look. This little village,
situated on the bank of a pool near the Nile, comprises a number of
small dwellings built of mud-bricks with flat straw-thatched roofs
on which chickens roost; on one I saw a goat. Some of the
dwellings, with small openings for doorways and narrow unglazed
windows, were surrounded with mud-and-stone walls amid tall
sheltering palms. Looking out across the desert through the
palm-trees, in the gorgeous sunset, one could see the peak of a
pyramid peeping over the crest of a sand-hill that rose from the
pond at our feet. The picture was reflected in the water at the
edge of which women chattered to each other as they filled
earthenware jars.</p>

<p>Riding away from the village I could not help looking back to
gaze in wonder on the scene, but Barney, who had cursed me for
bringing him all this way for "nothing," hurried me on, saying "You
can stay and become sheik of the damned place if you like, but no
more of this for mine."</p>

<p>Later&mdash;I was just enjoying a nice cup of coffee when a
"jack" (military policeman) came in with the news that our
battalion is moving immediately. Suppose the Turkish Patrol has
been sighted, but shall go and see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII. BOYS OF THE SUEZ
CANAL</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">This is war&mdash;The
front&mdash;Christmas Day at Ferry Post&mdash;A night in the
desert&mdash;A night with the Bikaners&mdash;A dud shell&mdash;A
midnight swim&mdash;An Anzac's letter&mdash;Meditation and
perspiration&mdash;Anzacs' holiday&mdash;An object lesson&mdash;The
Khedive's Star&mdash;A Gyppo's reference.</p>

<p class="cp">(15 December 1915-3 February 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Wednesday, Dec. 15th.</i>&mdash;We have an all-night party.
Breaking camp, folding tents, packing stores, drawing new
equipment, rifles, short bayonets, and 100 rounds of ammunition per
man. Someone fires a shot to see if the ammunition is dinkum. We
receive 24 hours' dry rations and are paid 100 "disasters" at
midnight.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Dec. 16th.</i>&mdash;Convinced that the Turks are
marching pon the Canal, we laugh and joke as we struggle to put our
equipment together in the dark. The O.C. informs us with much
enthusiasm, "This is war, men" and, believing him to be right, we
fall in at 3 a.m. and march with heavy equipment and light hearts
to entrain, and leave Helmieh at 7 a.m. Tom and I have a
compartment to ourselves as we are in charge of the bicycles. There
is some cultivation between the railway and a canal running almost
parallel but we get tired of gazing at this and have a sleep.</p>

<p>Arriving at Moascar, a siding three miles west of Ismailia, we
detrain at 12 noon. As the train departs I say, "Where's your
cardigan, Tom?" He chases the train in vain, and returns to call me
a bloody fool for leaving his bloody cardigan behind.</p>

<p>There are Tommies and Indians in this camp, and we ask them the
way to the war, but they don't seem to agree there's one
"here-abart." We bivouac for the night under the stars, and I am
much impressed as we lie down in rows with piled arms and the
sentries march to and fro.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Dec. 17th.</i>&mdash;It gets very cold towards
morning&mdash;there's a heavy dew, and we get wet through. As we
mount our cycles to go ahead of the battalion to the "front," the
O.C. informs us that we should pedal in step, but instead we race
over the sweet-water canal and on through the picturesque
tree-lined streets and public gardens of Ismailia, down to the Suez
Canal.</p>

<p>Feeling most important, we cross the pontoon bridge to Ferry
Post on the east bank of Lake Tim-sah. There are trenches at the
top of a sand-hill close in front, and a garrison of Gurkhas at the
bottom. Cautiously we climb the hill and more cautiously we peep
over the top&mdash;our hearts sink, for there's not a sign of a
Turk or any other living thing on the desert that stretches before
our gaze to the horizon.</p>

<p>Turning about we look over Lake Timsah and see the French
warship <i>Requin</i> stranded near our shore. The only bright spot
on the landscape is Ismailia,' where we might have lingered to have
a drink, but it's too late now; so we visit the Gurkhas, bright
little chaps, but they refuse to unsheath their <i>kukris,</i>
which (so it is said) have to taste blood before being
re-sheathed.</p>

<p>And now, here comes the battalion. We tell those in front how
the Gurkhas scalped seven Turks last night, but by the time the
word reaches D Company, the number has risen to 700.</p>

<p>We have a lunch of biscuits and bully-beef, and also a little
game of two-up, while the O.C. inspects the position, and then,
along with five others and with Eric W. in charge, I am sent to FE,
the visual signalling station of the post. The station consists of
a tent, which has to be erected at the foot of the bank near the
canal, and a platform, with a parapet of sand-bags, facing the
"enemy" on top of the hill. We decide watches&mdash;two signallers
two hours on and four off&mdash;and with a promise of remuneration
I take on cook's job as well.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Dec. 25th.</i>&mdash;It is Christmas Day&mdash;I
have received the first mail from home&mdash;have been to church
parade (voluntary)&mdash;enjoyed my half of a Christmas pudding
(being issued to each two men) from some thoughtful ladies of
Western Australia, also drinks and an extra ration of cheese. The
G.O.C., Canal Defences, visited us while we were having dinner. He
gave us a smile and a few kind words and we felt most grateful. Now
while I'm waiting for tea and the promised Christmas cake, I'll
write p something from my notes of the last nine days.</p>

<p>The news of the evacuation from Anzac came as a great shock to
all. That campaign, so far as Australia is concerned, has
established us a nation in the eyes of the world and has set us a
standard to maintain if we get the opportunity. Apart from that it
seems to have been a bloody washout.</p>

<p>Our week on the signalling station was most interesting.
Signalling with flags and heliograph by day, and Begby lamp by
night, we had communication with the outposts on both our left and
right and sometimes with the Bikaner Camel Corps patrols out in the
desert. The warships in Lake Timsah signal with searchlights by day
and mast-head lights by night. Out of all the messages we received
there was not one of a warlike nature, and the Turks might be 1,000
miles away for all we know.</p>

<p>While on outpost duty we had to keep five rounds in the
magazines of our rifles, and the sentries received instructions to
shoot any dogs seen, as they might be carrying messages to the
enemy. We were also given orders not to smoke on the sky-line at
night time. This injunction seems ridiculous, as our Begby lamp can
be seen and heard for miles, but the officer of the guard would not
accept this explanation when he roared me up for having a smoke.
"Playing soldiers," that's what I told him we were doing; and he
reported me for insubordination, though it should have been for
giving "lip."</p>

<p>Some members of the 30th Battalion, living in the glamour of the
name won for Australia and New Zealand on Gallipoli by the Anzac
Corps, seem to give themselves an air of superiority, really quite
insupportable, over the British artillerymen, and also over the
Bikaner Camel Corps, Hyderabad Lancers, Indian mountain battery,
and Gyppo road-makers, who (along with some wandering Arabs) are
the only other inhabitants of this sector of the outpost line.</p>

<p>What "gets" me and other Aussies about the Tommy we have so far
met is the inordinate respect he pays to those of higher rank. The
Bikaners are a superior and most dignified body of men, quite
unlike the Hyderabads, whose begging ways are not far removed from
those of the Gyppos.</p>

<p>At present our battalion has to supply the fatigue party for
working the ferry punt, which is put into commission when the
pontoon bridge is swung to the side of the Canal in order to allow
the passage of shipping between Suez and Port Said. As they work on
the chains pulling the ferry across, they chant Aussie versions of
the "hymns" the Gyppos sing to Allah; if that particular God has
any influence in the hereafter, we are in for a rough time.</p>

<p>As the passenger ships pass by, we swim out for the good things
the people throw us&mdash;tobacco, fruit, and drinks; and we have
to be lively on the dive to grab them as they sink, and to use
powerful strokes against the suction as that would draw us down
towards the ship.</p>

<p>The colonel was standing in front of the telephone dugout
waiting for the alarm to go at 8 p.m. when a ship came before his
vision, the passengers promenading in evening dress. "My Gad!
Sloan," he exclaimed, "what magnificently beautiful women!
Oh&mdash;" but he got no farther, for the alarm sounded at that
moment and so we were denied the opportunity of being entertained
possibly with romantic verse.</p>

<p>The only signs of the Turkish attack of last February are a few
of the steel pontoons which the enemy dragged across the desert.
These were riddled with bullets, but we have stuffed p the holes
with rags and they serve for the purpose of a short cruise. While
on the signalling station we bought fish from the lake fishermen,
and lived well despite my rotten cooking, for which I received ten
piastres.</p>

<p>Yesterday two other signallers and myself were sent with, a
reconnoitring company to an uninhabited oasis known as the
"Markets," lying at the foot of some sand-hills about five miles
from our camp. The Arabs and Bedouins meet here every Friday and
barter or sell grain, fruit, horses, camels, donkeys, and goats. It
is said that the Turks raided them on one occasion last winter, so
we went out on the off-chance of a scrap. But after marching in
battle order and carrying a heliograph over five miles of mostly
loose sand, I didn't feel much like a box-on when we got there,
yet, after some lunch, I was disappointed over the non-appearance
of the Turks.</p>

<p>Compared with the men of the companies, we signallers are much
more fortunate in our work. We don't have to dig trenches, rig
barbed-wire entanglements, or do guards and fatigues; when we have
to take our place on the march with even more equipment than the
company men, we feel like the office "rats" of the cities do after
a day's digging in the garden.</p>

<p>Since we are not allowed leave to Ismailia, and when we are not
on some signalling duty, the routine even to physical jerks is the
same as before, there's nothing else to write about but chats,
sand, and flies.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 2nd. 1916.</i>&mdash;We are back at FE. Covered
in sand, I have just come off my two hours' shift. The wind is
moving sand-hills at the rate of tons per second; it's the worst
day we have so far experienced.</p>

<p>As we are short of field telephones, Barney and I were given
special leave last Monday to have a "look around." So we went to
Ismailia, and&mdash;after a good feed, washed down with several
cups of delightful French coffee, and a few pints of beer&mdash;we
succeeded, with the aid of a screw driver and a pair of
wire-cutters, in borrowing from the town two phone sets which now,
thanks to Mac and Cipher, have been remodelled and are giving
service.</p>

<p>We nearly had our first casualty this week when one of the chaps
cleaning his rifle let it go off. The bullet made several loud
reports as it passed through four or five tents, and for the moment
we thought the war had arrived.</p>

<p>C Company marched out on Wednesday last to Hill 353, where it is
to remain for some time as an advance-guard for a surveying party.
According to the news we have picked up from the signallers out
there, the company is having a rough trot. It has to depend on a
camel train for its supplies of bully-beef and biscuits and water,
which arrive in very small quantities.</p>

<p>On Friday I went out to the Markets oasis again. When the
company left on its return march, I remained behind to do a little
job, and then, deciding that I would follow their tracks when the
day was cooler, I had a sleep. When I awakened the sun was too near
the west for me to have time to tramp back to camp. At first I
welcomed the idea of a night out under the stars, but suddenly
remembered I was due for duty on FE. Climbing a sand-hill I just
had sufficient sun to call Eric up on the helio. "You silly young
&mdash;&mdash;," he sent in Morse, but he promised to keep my
absence dark.</p>

<p>That night I'll never forget. "Christmas day in the Work-house"
had nothing on my New Year's Eve at the oasis. The ray of a
warship's searchlight was my only joy, but it reminded me that the
operators were looking for Turks&mdash;and had not this oasis been
attacked? The howling of wild dogs did not add to my comfort, and I
eventually laid clown to sleep with only one resolution&mdash;that
I would never be a damned fool again.</p>

<p>The morning came at last, and, as I lifted my haversack that had
served as a pillow, I disturbed my companion of the night, a queer
looking thing, about ten inches long, which I have since learnt,
was a scorpion. I had gone only about a mile of my way when I saw
some camels making straight for me, and I was much relieved when
they turned out to be a patrol of Bikaners under Lieutenant Subadar
Johri Singh. He questioned me in perfect English, and, being
satisfied with my replies, gave me a lift up behind him on his
camel. I shall never forget that rocking ride on the ship of the
desert so long as I live.</p>

<p>The patrol being out for the best part of the day, I again
called p Eric at FE. Even the dignified Subadar, who could read
Morse, laughed at the abuse that came flashing through the air.
However, Eric assured me that I had not been missed, and, when I
offered to do four shifts straight off upon my return, he Morsed
T.A.R., which I wrongly interpreted to be an abbreviation for
"That's all right."</p>

<p>As we bumped about the desert I talked in jerks to Johri Singh,
who had been educated in an English university. Our conversation
ranged from Australia and its "white" policy to the war and many
other topics, and he was highly amused when I showed him, among
others, a photo of my girl. Of course I asked him many questions,
but he shut up like an oyster when I inquired if he was married. On
arrival at our camp I thanked him for the trip as I rubbed my
numbed seat, and accepted an invitation to attend his mess for
dinner next Friday night.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Jan. 6th.</i>&mdash;H.M.S. <i>Glory</i> passed
along from Port Said to-day. The queerest thing Mark Twain ever saw
in the East was a man smashing stones with a shirt-front&mdash;and
that's what one of the Hyderabad Lancers has been doing to my
clothes for the past two hours, in consideration for a few
piastres. His treatment will at least bash the life out of the
chats, if it does not otherwise make my rags clean.</p>

<p>Same old routine, two hours on and four off. Eric is in good
trim to-night on half a bottle of whisky I souvenired from a
passing ship and presented to him for keeping quiet about my night
out. There's one thing about Eric, he can keep things to
himself&mdash;and that's what he's done with the whisky.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 9th.</i>&mdash;We were relieved at FE on Friday.
Duties since then have consisted of burying phone cable between
here and Hill 353, and some telephone work in trenches. Yesterday I
had a job repairing some of our cycles, which was preferable to
drill after my wild time on Friday night.</p>

<p>The Bikaner officers' dinner of curry and other dishes has upset
my tummie quite a lot. Of course Wal and I had to be sociable and
"do as Rome does," so we joined with them in smoking the
hubble-bubble pipe as it was passed around, and I had more than my
first taste of whisky. Johri Singh worked overtime interpreting
between us and his cobbers, and when the time arrived for us to
take our leave (I also "took" an engraved Indian dish which I am
sending home to Dad for an ash tray), Johri and his Bikaner braves
cheered us out into the cold windy night. In the morning I woke up
to find myself half-covered in sand in an old disused trench, and
it was raining like blazes.</p>

<p>Rex, one of the reinforcement signallers, who has been away with
mumps, gave me a lecture about the company I keep and my behaviour
in getting drunk with the Bikaners and pinching a souvenir. So I
have been, for a walk with Rex, Ron, and Reg this afternoon; after
picking up some bullets and shrapnel near Lake Timsah, we waded out
and swam to and around the French cruiser <i>Requin</i> but the
Froggies did not invite us on board.</p>

<p>Plum pudding and apple jelly, the latter bought, for dinner
to-day. H.M.S. <i>Jupiter</i> passed up Canal.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Jan. 10th.</i>&mdash;Usual routine. Chats and flies
getting worse. Had a ride on the donkeys this evening as they
returned to the post from work on the road.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Jan. 11th.</i>&mdash;Trying route march from 6.30
a.m. to 4.30 p.m. Found an unexploded 15-pounder naval shell out on
the march and lugged it all the way back to camp.</p>

<div class="newspaper">
<p>[Beyond this bald entry, Ted failed' to record the events of
this day in his diary, but a cobber bridges the gap:</p>

<p>"The boys returning to the tent after a swim found him trying to
screw the time-fuse off the shell. They promptly tossed him out and
the shell also, which he took to the Indian mountain battery. On
his return, he placed the time-fuse in his haversack and when he
commenced poking into the opening of the shell, he was tossed out
again and not allowed to return. It was just getting dusk when he
pinched our only candle from underneath the tent and we chased him
up the hill. He had a little accident near the cookhouse, removed
his short pants and, with his shirt waving in the breeze, raced us
to the Canal. The last we saw of him that evening, he was walking
along the other side of the Canal with pants in hand, and singing
about his little grey home in the west. He spent that night at the
telephone dugout where he and the orderly, after drinking a
wash-basin of Gyppo beer, had an argument over twenty 'disasters,'
and the others, wanting to get rid of them, suggested they have a
race across the Canal. Ted, however, was the only one
away&mdash;running down the steep bank, he swam across and was
half-way back when he got cramps in the stomach, and was carried
with the current down to the next station. Here they fished him out
and Rex and the boys brought him back to life, only to hear him say
he was going to get even on the 'cows.' That was about one in the
morning, and, apart from being nearly drowned, he might have
stopped a bullet, for the sentries were only too glad of a chance
to shoot."</p>

<p>The sequel to this was about a week later when, following up his
argument with the orderly and receiving the worse of a fight on the
jetty, he dragged his opponent into the Canal and almost drowned
him.]</p>
</div>

<p><i>Wednesday, Jan. 12th.</i>&mdash;Had another night out last
night. Attended my first army sick parade this morning. Dr Morelle
ordered medicine and duty. "Paint 'is back wiv iodine and give 'im
one of dese and one of dose," he said. ("One of dese and one of
dose" were a No. 9 pill and a smaller one.) The duty turned out to
be a day's skirmishing in the sand.</p>

<p>Received a nice parcel addressed to a "lonely Anzac" from a dear
old lady of Western Australia. Pudding, writing pad, toffee,
cigarettes, and tin of cheese (wish it was a tin of insecticide);
and rather than disappoint her I enclosed a note in the envelope
already addressed for the reply:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear missus thank you for the parsel the puddin
was very nice i give the fags to my cobber bill a lonely Anzac to
because I don't smoke the lollies nice to and we dont get no bungo
ere ether bills just ad is arm blowd orf so e arsts me to thank you
for the fags aint kild no Turks to day but we are winnin the war
orlrite not noin nuthing about rightin and thankin you agane an
opin this findes you as it leays me at present will call an see you
cumin ome from dinkiedye Bill Adams.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Jan. 13th.</i>&mdash;Rain, wind, and cold. Four
signallers went with A Company out to Hill 353 and back to-day.
They say the boys of C Company call the valley where they are
camped "Pinchgut."</p>

<p><i>Friday, Jan. 14th.</i>&mdash;Received a mail from home.
Mother wants to know if I will ever regret taking up arms to defend
my country. Oh no, I'll never regret it, but that little question
has served to remind me why I'm here. If marching with a load of
some seventy pounds in the sand and heat of the desert, standing at
attention when you want to scratch a chat, eating boiled fat bacon,
damned hard biscuits, salt bully-beef and an occasional luxury from
home or the canteen&mdash;but otherwise having a good time,
swimming and drinking and swearing and laughing&mdash;means
defending your country, well I suppose it will do me, yet I would
feel more satisfied if we could have a battle now and then to
relieve the monotony and justify our existence. However, there's no
need to go into that detail when answering Mother's question. I'll
just say "I shall never regret doing my bit, I'm having a bonzer
time."</p>

<p>Received 100 "disaster" pay, equivalent to 1 0s. 7d. Spent
quarter of it on tinned fruit and Ideal milk.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Jan. 15th.</i>&mdash;Nothing different.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 16th.</i>&mdash;Much the same. Church parade in
morning, unloading water pipes in afternoon. The latest chorus to
the tune of "Boys of the Dardanelles" runs:</p>

<p class="letter">Boys of the Suez Canal,<br>
Who say they will and shall<br>
Give the Turks the time of their lives,<br>
Drink their wine and run off with their wives,<br>
Australia wants the very best from you,<br>
Though you're fed on cheese and stew,<br>
With jam once a week,<br>
And pack drill if you squeak,<br>
Boys of the great Canal.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Jan. 17th.</i>&mdash;O.C. Stan had us out in front of
the trenches this morning for physical jerks. After giving us a
most severe scolding, he ordered double. So off we went faster and
faster, straight back to breakfast, leaving Stanley shouting
unheard orders out in the sand. We should he crimed for this, but
Stan won't take the risk of his competence being questioned. In the
essential duties we give him of our best, but we just can't stand
his treating us like a lot of school-boys practising for an Empire
Day drill-display.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Jan. 18th.</i>&mdash;Hospital ship from Aussie
passed up Canal. Had a box-on to-day and received a bonzer black
eye.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Jan. 19th.</i>&mdash;Had another game of soldiers.
Dud C. was the flank man for fixing bayonets, but as his bayonet
was rusted into the scabbard he just went through the actions, and
now the signallers are the laughing stock of the battalion.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Jan. 20th.</i>&mdash;Buried cable during day. On
outpost duty at night&mdash;Jim J. in charge. He slept well all
night, so might have we for all that did not happen.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Jan. 21st.</i>&mdash;Back at FE for a week. Built a
dugout with a fire-place, but chimney smokes a treat. Pinched coal
from railway. Received mail from home, parcel still on the way.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Jan. 22nd.</i>&mdash;This afternoon two persons
dressed ostensibly as New Zealand officers took photos from both
sides of the Canal. I told Eric they looked like spies, and he is
going to report the matter. Darned my socks and sewed up the tops
of Eric's. Our boys beat a team from H.M.S. Cornwallis at soccer
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 23rd.</i>&mdash;First parcel from home. Tobacco,
socks, chocolate, tooth paste, chat comb, boracic acid, liver
pills, chewing gum, and cake of soap with a note "Wash me, mother
dear."</p>

<p><i>Monday, Jan. 24th.</i>&mdash;The 5th A.I. Brigade (17th,
18th, 19th and 20th Battalions) from Gallipoli came over the Canal.
In their faded, ragged uniforms they look a worn out lot and they
did not take the least interest in our cheers. It seems they are
past cheering or caring. In fact they look like a mob of sheep, but
I guess they would make us look silly if the Turks attacked
to-night. Tom H. of the 20th, twin brother to Reg on our station,
visited us. He said very little about the "Peninsh" and just
answered our questions in a vague sort of way, but his appearance
was eloquent enough to cause us to feel admiration for his service
there and regrets for what we had missed.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Jan. 25th.</i>&mdash;Wild and stormy last night. One
of C Company at Hill 353 shot himself through the leg.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Jan. 26th.</i>&mdash;5th Brigade marched out to
Hill 353, where they are to have a little "holiday" in the sand
after their work at Anzac.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Jan. 27th.</i>&mdash;Eric had forgotten to report
the N.Z. "spies," who turned up again today. We had an argument
about calling out the guard to put them under arrest, but Eric
decided to go and see the O.C. first. The way those two "N.Zs"
hopped it convinced me they were spies, and Eric's order to arrest
them was much too late.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Jan. 28th.</i>&mdash;Relieved 3.30 p.m. at FE.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Jan. 29th.</i>&mdash;On duty at phone dugout from 6
p.m. to 6 a.m., Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 30th.</i>&mdash;C Company returned from Hill 353
looking almost as bad as their Anzac relief. Peter K. left to join
his brother in the 1st Division Artillery. The Hyderabad Lancers
also left this post.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Jan. 31st.</i>&mdash;Pay-day. One of the chaps got
his and then reported his complaint to the M.O. He's now behind
barbed-wire. Rotten luck. Wish I could see him again before he's
sent away, for he was a good cobber.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Feb. 1st.</i>&mdash;Took the patient some chops for
breakfast&mdash;crawled the last 200 yards and dropped them in the
sand as I was struggling under the barbed-wire. He shared the cold
and sanded chops with two others in the tent, and then said: "See
what you didn't get for not doin' as I did but doin' as I told yer.
Now yer young b&mdash;&mdash;, get goin' out o' this afore they
grabs yer. Keep out o' trouble till I sees yer again&mdash;so long,
old timer."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Feb. 2nd.</i>&mdash;The 6th and 7th Infantry
Brigades and rest of the 5th&mdash;all Anzacs&mdash;came over the
Canal to-day. A limber fell into the Canal from the pontoon bridge
and some chaps dived in to try and free the horses. (The Q.M.
blames this accident for the loss of several tons of stores,
whereas a limber holds only about half a ton.)</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Feb. 3rd.</i>&mdash;Battalion went for picnic march
to Ismailia. We had some sports in the Gardens, and I enjoyed a
rock-melon more than anything I have ever had.</p>

<p>We are leaving Ferry Post on Sunday. With three brigades now at
the post, in place of a single battalions it looks as though a war
or something is expected, and I suppose that's why they are
shifting us out of the way. Alan's latest furphy&mdash;we are to
each receive the Khedive's Star from the Egyptian Government for
defending the Canal and the men of C Company will get a bar for
Hill 353.</p>

<p>"Kossey," our Gyppo servant, is much upset over our leaving. We
have given him a reference which he keeps wrapped in oiled silk. It
goes something like this:</p>

<p class="newspaper">To warn those whom it may concern. <i>Saida
Wallaheds</i> (Good-day, fellows)&mdash;<br>
<br>
The bearer, "Kossey," through whose finger marks you may be able to
read this, is a&mdash;&mdash;. There are only three &mdash;&mdash;s
in Egypt and he's all of them. He has robbed us of our
<i>velouse</i> (money), pinched our <i>mungare</i> (food), and is
always begging <i>baksheesh.</i> There's not enough water in the
Canal to wash the dirt off him, nor will his following of flies
ever clean his eyes or die of starvation. His one qualification is
not being <i>magnoon</i> (mad) like us in joining the army. Give
him a trial kick in the &mdash;&mdash; and watch him <i>imshi
igri</i> (go quickly). We are leaving him <i>bookra</i> (to-morrow)
and wish him a soldier's farewell.<br>
<br>
<i>Mafeesh</i> (finish).</p>

<p><i>"Quice kateer, quice kateer"</i> ("very nice, very nice"),
Kossey says, as he shows this document to his prospective
employers, and of course they give him the boot. Perhaps I'm a bit
soft, but somehow I feel sorry for the poor cow.</p>

<p class="cp">(4 February-31 March 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 15th, 1916.</i>&mdash;We have just been
inoculated and have two days off duty, so I'll take the opportunity
of writing up events since leaving Ferry Post on 6 February, when
we marched to Moascar and thence came by train to Tel-el-Kebir.
Tel-el-Kebir is situated about thirty miles west of Ismailia, and
sixty miles east of Cairo, on the main railway running parallel
with the sweet-water canal. This canal runs from the Nile near
Cairo through the Wadi Tumilat and into Lake Timsah.</p>

<p>It was here in 1882 that General Wolseley defeated Arabi Pasha,
since when Egypt has been under the control of England. Although
the battle of Tel-el-Kebir was fought thirty-four years ago, the
trenches are still in existence, and material, uniforms, guns, and
bullets may be dug out of the sand. Digging up the well-preserved
skeletons of Gyppos has been stopped since the buglers of our
battalion decorated the outside of their tent with a number of
skulls and bones in their effort to win the competition for the
best dressed tent. I wonder if, some thirty years hence, my bones
will be dug out of a battlefield and used to cheer up the soldiers
of that time.</p>

<p>The best feature of this camp is the generally hard surface of
the ground, which though in places rough with pebbles, is much
better to march on than the loose sand of the Sinai desert. In this
encampment, a long belt of bell-tents along the northern side of
the railway, there are about 50,000 Australians, including some
30,000 of the newly formed 4th and 5th Divisions. Between the lines
of tents and the matting mess-huts is a long laneway, with a wider
space between the huts and a long row of Gyppo shops that has
sprung up since we came here. Parallel with these are the road, the
railway, and the sweet-water canal, with much cultivation
stretching from its southern bank.</p>

<p>At night many thousands of troops gather in the space between
the huts and shops to play or look on at two-up, crown and anchor,
housie-housie and other such games. The thousands of flickering
candles and smoky slush-lamps make a sight one will never forget.
Nor will I forget my own experience there last night. With 200
piastres in my pocket, and with the intention of purchasing some
souvenirs, I was passing through this fairyland of lights when my
attention was drawn to a game of crown and anchor. Somehow I
couldn't go wrong, and, after winning about 500 "disasters," I left
with the proprietor calling me all kinds of a &mdash;&mdash; for
"buttoning up." Trouble is I didn't button up enough sufficiently
to prevent my pocket from being picked bare while I was walking to
the shops. What a gutzer to be rich one minute and broke the next.
On the way back I got into the inner circle of a two-up school just
in time to go down on the cash when someone called "Jacks!" In the
ensuing scramble I got hold of a 50-disaster note as well as
receiving a perfect uppercut that almost knocked me out.</p>

<p>Most evenings I spend looking up old cobbers, some from Anzac
and others just recently arrived from Aussie. With six of the old
Burwood schoolboys I had a wonderful time one night. We talked of
the good old school-days, and it was just like being back there to
hear them calling me "Mutton." How I wish we could all be in the
one section, particularly now that, with the exception of six of
the old hands, the original signal section of the 30th has been
split up. Some have gone to the 5th Division Signallers and others
to the artillery. Barney has sung his swan song&mdash;"Farmer Brown
'e 'ad a little farm down on the E.I.O., and on that farm 'e 'ad
some goats, down on the E.I.O."&mdash;to we who are staying on in
the infantry&mdash;the P.B.I. ("poor bloody infantry"), he calls
it&mdash;and he is now in a pioneer battalion. Reg H. has joined
his brother Tom in the 20th Battalion; Rex F., Reg C., and Ron C.
are now signallers in the 8th Machine-Gun Company; and our O.C.
(Stan E.) is on the divisional staff. I could have had a transfer
to the divisional signallers, but I much prefer to stay with the
old battalion, though I would have gone to the machine-gun company
if I'd had the chance.</p>

<p>The last five weeks have seen many changes. The 29th, 30th,
31st, and 32nd Battalions are now together as the 8th Brigade for
the first time, and with the 14th and 15th Brigades, which have
been formed from Anzacs and surplus reinforcements&mdash;together
with artillery, engineers, machine-gunners, signallers, pioneers,
medical and a few other specialist units&mdash;comprise the new 5th
Australian Division, now awaiting its G.O.C., Major-General
M'Cay.</p>

<p>We have had an inspection by our brigadier (General Tivey), a
march past a general "Brasshat," and an inspection by General
Birdwood, who has given us his orders regarding discipline. On
important parades such as these all hands, including the cooks,
have to turn out. One chap, who had not been on a parade for some
time, fell in with half a candle sticking to the entrenching tool
at his rear, and of course someone had to light it. "Fall out that
man with the candle!" ordered an officer, but no one moved. "That
man with the candle, take two paces forward!" Still no one moved.
"You!" (pointing to the man). "Damn you, fall out!" But it was not
until he burnt his inquiring fingers on his tail light that the
luckless offender fell out.</p>

<p>Met Norman H. the other day, and he gave me an introduction to a
chap in the A.S.C. who is looking after my inner man. I go on my
cycle to see him every night, and when I return with fresh bread,
raspberry jam, cooked meat, and other luxuries, Eric is always
waiting for me on the railway embankment with a couple of bottles
of beer. We have a good feed, go to the camp pictures or to see a
fight, or perhaps have a flutter at two-up, and then feeling well
satisfied, with the work of the day forgotten, we sleep.</p>

<p>Our rations continue to be much the same: for
breakfast&mdash;boiled fat bacon, porridge, and sometimes bread;
for dinner (if we are not out on a march)&mdash;stew, curry, etc.;
for tea&mdash;cheese, biscuits, and jam. Have seen Eric at one
sitting eat more than a pound of cheese with four or five army
biscuits ("Anzac wafers").</p>

<p>The morning rush on the bacon dixie is the event of the day. If
you come late you naturally get a "blank file;" if you happen to
land a piece with one streak of lean, it's a "lance-corporal;" but,
no matter how early you arrive, you usually get a "private" (all
fat). A "brigadier-general" (all lean) has not yet been seen. But,
despite the tucker and hard work, we continue to put on solid
condition.</p>

<p>While on a route march a dispatch rider caught up with the
column with orders for the signallers who saw the "N.Z. spies" to
be sent back to camp. On the way thither we had a few pot-shots and
made some Gyppos hop it over the sky-line. Receiving instructions,
we took our cycles on the mail train to Ismailia and reported at
Army Headquarters, where we were asked if we could identify the
N.Z. officers, and were then told to go and look for them. After a
most enjoyable hour or two in Ismailia, we decided that it was a
hopeless task, so split up to go our own ways.</p>

<p>I went out about ten miles to the roadhead on the other side of
the Canal, where I got a lift on a camel and visited the positions
known as Mt Kembla, Mt Keira, Australia Hill, Mt Katoomba, and
Hog's Back, and then came back by road to the railhead whither my
bike had been returned in a limber. During the trip I met a number
of old cobbers to whom I showed my magic Army Headquarters pass;
they were much interested, but, when I told them I was now a
lieutenant in the secret service, they sang: "His cobbers don't
believe him, for he's a bloody liar." That night I spent at Ferry
Post, had a swim in the morning, and, after reporting back to
Ismailia, returned to Tel-el-Kebir with Eric, to tell the boys many
lies about how we bagged the spies.</p>

<p>Most of the chaps have had leave to Cairo, but I never seem to
have enough cash to manage it&mdash;anyhow, I don't like Cairo,
sour grapes perhaps. However, I had an interesting day with Rex and
Co. before they left the battalion. With special leave we went on
our cycles to visit the other side of the sweet-water canal.
Entering a little village, we were at first received in much the
same manner as the day when Barney and I went out from Cairo, but
when the head man saw that we were genuinely interested and had a
few piastres to spare, he showed us round.</p>

<p>We found the insides of the dwellings to be as drab as the
exteriors. A few split palm trunks serve to support the flat roofs,
the interior walls are of the same mud colour as the outsides, and
very little light comes through the slits of windows. A few worn
mats lie upon the mud floors where perhaps a bed made of palm
branches and a number of earthenware pots are the only furnishings.
The guide says <i>"Quice kateer!"</i> and we answer <i>"Quice,"</i>
wondering how long it will take the fowls we hear to scratch
through the roof.</p>

<p>Next we are shown an incubator, and learn that the fowls in
Egypt do not sit. Eggs, coarse maize bread, and vegetables seem to
be the only foods, but the Gyppos must have a taste for meat, for I
have seen many of them diving their hands into our rubbish tins in
search of chunks of it.</p>

<p>A group of smiling children looked happy enough in their ragged
clothes and bare feet, as they stood beneath some sheltering palms
watching us inspect their domain. The sight of the women covering
up their heads and turning away made me feel sorry for their
pathetic life, but I suppose they knock out a bit of fun when
there's a marriage, a birth-feast, a funeral, or a circumcision.
Boys must be in great demand, for the last-mentioned event takes
the form of a procession from the home to the barber's shop where
the operation is performed, and then the guests all have a great
feast upon returning to the boy's home. I forgot to ask how the
barber gets on for a procession if he has a son, but that is
probably another case of the bootmaker's kid being the worst
shod.</p>

<p>The intensive cultivation reminds me somewhat of the Chow's
gardens on the Cook's River flats at home, where we used to pole up
in bulrush rafts and pinch their vegetables. The Gyppos, while
thorough, are most primitive in their farming. Water is drawn from
the sweet-water canal to the irrigation channels by means of the
<i>shaduf</i> (a pole swinging. between two posts), with a mud
counterweight at one end, and a bucket at the other. This is worked
by hand and, where the water is low, as many as six Gyppos may be
seen working <i>shadufs,</i> one above the other up the bank. In
some places a spiral hand-worked pump is used; in others a buffalo
may be seen going round and round driving a wooden cog-wheel which
operates, by means of other such wheels, an elevating wheel of
water-pots. A wooden one-furrow plough, as evolved umpteen B.C., is
still used. A camel, together with a donkey or a buffalo in double
harness drawing a plough or some other antiquated farming implement
is quite a common sight.</p>

<p>After seeing such conditions of life it makes one feel that our
civilization is worth fighting for. And that reminds me, I have
been in the army about eight months now and feel further away from
the war than ever I did. The thoughts I had of fighting are like
the mirages we see on the desert. We go on and on towards them but
never get there. We are just living for the day, and have long
since lost the habit of dreaming and looking back. But for a few
moments at sunset or perhaps on a church parade, it is seldom I
think of home, and then it is only to form some hazy vision of the
past. Looking into the future it is only to think of the feed of
juicy steak I'll have when I get home and&mdash;well, that's about
all. I feel as though I was born in the army and, despite the hard
life, I like it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the effects of inoculation and heat of the day are
making me a bit soft in the "nut," for I can hear a chap two tents
away cursing the army for all he's worth. Perhaps that, too, is the
result of the inoculation.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, March 19th.</i>&mdash;We were issued with our colour
patches to-day&mdash;purple and gold. The purple stands for the
battalion, the gold for the brigade. This is a most important
event. It is the finishing touch to our uniform and brings a thrill
of pride. It reminds me of final leave in Aussie when we decorated
our shoulders with blue and gold ribbons, for, like niggers or boy
scouts, we just had to have a bit of distinctive colour.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 22nd.</i>&mdash;A red-letter day. We have
been inspected by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. After the parade we
crowded down to the road to get a close look at our young Prince as
he rode by on his horse, accompanied by General Birdwood and staff.
The Prince is serving, as a lieutenant, with a British regiment,
and I think we like him better for this than if he'd turned out as
a field-marshal. With an English complexion, he looked very young,
and I thought rather tired. There was nothing stiff about the
manner in which he rode by on his horse and received our many
cheers. "He'll do me," I heard someone say, and those few words may
be taken as an expression of our general opinion.</p>

<p>We are leaving here to-morrow. The 5th Division is taking over
part of the Canal defence, and I hope we'll get some stoush this
time. The 8th Brigade ("Tivey's Chocolates," they call us) is going
by train to Ismailia, and the 14th and 15th Brigades have to
march.</p>

<p>Looking over my notes of Tel-el-Kebir, the twenty-round fight
between Rowan and Kavanagh, both of the 29th Battalion, stands out
as being the most important event. The death of a sergeant in the
31st Battalion, who was shot through the eye at sighting practice,
was, I believe, our only casualty. Sighting practice is carried out
with dummy cartridges, but somehow a live cartridge got among the
dummies, and resulted in a most unfortunate accident.</p>

<p>We have received gifts from the 30th Battalion Comforts Fund in
Sydney. Its members must spend much time and money, and our
appreciation is based on more than the material value of the gifts.
Thoughtfulness such as this reminds one that war is even worse for
the folk at home than it is for us. To them the war must be one
long agony of suspense, whereas for us it is a life of hardship
mixed with lots of amusement, but by taking each as it comes we
know not the mental anguish of suspense.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, March 26th.</i>&mdash;We arrived at Ferry Post last
Thursday evening, and expect to be moved out to the front line
within the next few days. I have been made a lance-corporal and
feel very proud of my right sleeve with its one stripe sewn below
the crossed-flag badge of the signallers. Standing with these
embellishments nearest the camera and trying to ignore the chaps
calling out "Buckshee Corp," I heard Tom say I looked like Linoleum
about to cross the Alps in an open boat.</p>

<p>The Adjutant, Captain S., sent for me this morning. On my way to
report to him I could not think of any recent wrongdoing, so,
concluding that it had to do with my promotion, I gave him a smart
salute and was much surprised to hear him enquire after my health.
It turns out that his sister of the Comforts Fund had asked him to
keep an eye on me, and he told me to come and see him if I am ever
in difficulties. His little talk gave me a feeling more
satisfactory than if he had handed me another two stripes, and,
forgetting myself, I shook hands instead of saluting as I left.
He's a good old sport, but I'll bet he'd go crook if he knew my
age.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 27th.</i>&mdash;Had a go at riding an unbroken
mule to-day, but fell off when we crashed into a bell-tent and
knocked it over. A Gyppo paper boy had just gone up the line
towards the colonel's tent singing out "Gypshun Mail, to-morrow's
paper, verra good news; Mr K. got a jack-in-the-box."</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 28th.</i>&mdash;The swimming at Ferry Post was
too good to last. Following a night in the open we moved off at 7
a.m., and arrived at Hog's Back after a ten-mile march, temperature
102 in the shade, but no shade and no water. Relieved New Zealand
Rifle Brigade.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 29th.</i>&mdash;A section of C Company was
pulled out last night to carry cases of beer to the officers' mess.
About 1 a.m. a cobber of mine brought me a bottle from a case he
'has buried in the sand. We got an issue of water this morning.
Hear that a number of the 14th Brigade died on the march from
Tel-el-Kebir.</p>

<p>Later. Am returning to Ferry Post with a few others to go to
Zeitoun Signalling School for a three weeks' course. Verra good
news indeed.</p>

<p><i>Friday, March 31st.</i>&mdash;At Ferry Post. Have seen a lot
of the 14th Brigade after their awful march. They look even worse
than did the troops upon their return from Gallipoli, and we have
heard much of 'their trying experience. They have not a good word
for those responsible for the march, but they are full of praise
for the New Zealanders who went out voluntarily from Moascar and
helped them in. The 15th Brigade arrived to-day and, although they
have had a better march, they all look knocked up. They rub it into
us about being "Tivey's Chocolates," but I fail to see how the
inhuman treatment they have received will make them any better in
action than we "Chocolates." Leaving here to-morrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X. GRAINS OF SAND</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Back to
school&mdash;The Pyramids and the Sphinx&mdash;The sergeant's
welcome&mdash;Bench Mark&mdash;A few hot days&mdash;Ridge
Post&mdash;A leaking boat&mdash;A poisoned foot and a final
flutter.</p>

<p class="cp">(1 April-15 June, 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Sunday, April 2nd, 1916</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Zeitoun
Imperial School of Instruction yesterday afternoon. The only item
of interest was the dining saloon on the Cairo express, where we
spent most of our time and a good deal of cash. Changing trains at
Cairo and hiring a car at Zeitoun, we arrived at the school in
first class style and found everything to be to our liking. Bunks
to sleep on, separate mess-huts, and every modern convenience. Also
good food and a fair amount of leave. We start work to-morrow. I'm
in the visual school. But at the moment I'm off to Cairo for the
day with Tom H., who is in the telephone school.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April 3rd.</i>&mdash;Had a good day yesterday. Went
over some of the old ground in Cairo, which is much more quiet now
there are only a few troops about. The Wazir is almost deserted of
troops and prices have been lowered in the keenness of trade. Tom
and I rode through this place on our donkeys, and I was glad not to
be alone. We found much to interest us as we went leisurely through
the different bazaars, and, after a good dinner at St James Hotel,
went out to the Pyramids.</p>

<p>With a good guide, though I cannot vouch for his truthfulness,
we climbed the 470 feet to the top of Cheops Pyramid. Some of the
stones are five feet high, and despite my good condition I knocked
at the knees more than once during the climb. At one time the
Pyramids were covered with smooth alabaster, a semi-transparent
stone, but this, with the exception of the capping on Chephren's
Pyramid, was afterwards used in the building of Cairo. Cheops,
built over 6000 years ago, is said to cover thirteen acres of land
and to contain 88,500,000 cubic feet of stone. This is all so much
beyond one's comprehension that it makes one feel of no more
importance on the map than a fly, and yet when having my photograph
taken on its top I did not forget to show my one little stripe.</p>

<p>Looking over the Nile valley to the east, Cairo in its setting
at the foot of violet hills presents a view in marked contrast to
the rippling sand-dunes of the Libyan Desert in the opposite
direction. Descending to the sands below, our guide next took us to
Cheops' sepulchre. At the entrance we took off our boots, not
because of reverence, but on account of the polished slippery ramp
going steeply down under the Pyramid. Slipping and sliding down
into the darkness with but the light of one candle, we then
ascended to the tomb, an extensive vault with a bare stone
sarcophagus surrounded by the dim forms of a number of Aussies
cracking jokes and chipping bits off for souvenirs. We learnt that
one piece of granite measured 15 x 5 x 7 feet. After paying a few
piastres to see the vault lit up with magnesium light, the troops
in the complete darkness made the most weird yells and war-cries I
have ever heard, putting the wind up the guides. When the candles
were re-lit we found our guide shaking like a leaf in Cheops'
sarcophagus.</p>

<p>We then had a look at the Sphinx of Gizeh, which for some 5000
years has gazed across the valley of the Nile, and we were informed
that in 1798 one of Napoleon's gunners had souvenired a large chunk
off its nose. The Temple of the Sphinx, with granite walls and an
alabaster floor, that is gradually finding its way to Aussie
through the post, was otherwise uninteresting to us who had had
enough Egyptian archaeology for one day.</p>

<p>After an enjoyable tea at the Pyramids Hotel, we went to church
service at the Y.M.C.A., Esbekia Gardens, and then back home. I say
home and mean it, for this signalling school is a home away from
the dinky die home we call the battalion. I wonder if D. has
finished off that case of beer?</p>

<p>The thoroughness and discipline of the British Army is reflected
in this school, where after only one day's work everything is going
as smoothly as clockwork. The subjects of the course include Morse
buzzer, lamp, heliograph, and flag signalling, map-reading, field
sketching, telephone work and cable laying, and in the final
practical and theory examinations 90 per cent is a pass. Unless
there's something to growl about I won't bother writing up my daily
progress, but will get stuck into the work and see if I can pull
off a first-class pass (95 per cent).</p>

<p><i>Friday, April 21st.</i>&mdash;The school is finished. I have
just had a last look at Cairo and am returning to the battalion
to-morrow with my first-class signaller's certificate. Tom came
first in the telephone school and I fluked the same place in the
visual with 99.7 per cent. Not a bad showing for the rough Aussies
in competition with Tommy regulars and others&mdash;and what-o the
30th. Wonder how well I would have passed if it had been a real
practical test with shells and other things flying
about&mdash;passed out with fright perhaps.</p>

<p>Met three signallers&mdash;Toc P., Chook F., and Lizz
L.&mdash;of our second reinforcements in the school. They don't
seem to belong to anyone so I am taking the responsibility of
introducing them to the battalion. Don't know how I'll get them
through without passes, but will give it a go.</p>

<p>Had charge of a section at the school one day and was almost
sacked and returned to my unit for taking them to an ostrich farm,
where we tried to ride the birds until one of our number was taken
to hospital with a kick in the stomach. Got even on the British
student officer who reported me, for I made him a runner on my
station the following day and I must say he ran well at 105 in the
shade.</p>

<p>Hear that we are going to France soon. The sooner the better, as
I'm fed up with this land of the three S's. There's a farewell
party on to-night, so here goes.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, April 23rd.</i>&mdash;Staging Camp, Ferry Post.
Believing that the reinforcement signallers would be put under
arrest if we detrained at Ismailia, we hopped off the wrong side of
the train at Moascar last night, and evaded the guard. Wal C., Alf
B., Viv M., Toc P., Chook F., and Lizz L. then fell into two deep,
and I marched them past the guard on the sweet-water canal bridge,
calling a cheery good-night as I waved a handful of paper with my
pass on the top.</p>

<p>The further we went the more Toc growled, but it was lucky for
him, and (for that matter) all of us, that we found the battalion
about midnight only a mile over the Suez Canal instead of ten miles
out at Hog's Back. The sergeant was most annoyed when I woke him
up, but when I introduced the three new signallers he went raving
mad and called me the biggest bloody bumptious basket in the
battalion. That's nothing to what I think of him&mdash;the lousy
cow.</p>

<p>We are packing up to move into Ferry Post tomorrow, where the
battalion is to take over the garrison duties for a week.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April 24th.</i>&mdash;Bench Mark, an outpost a few
miles north of Ferry Post on the Suez Canal. Came here with a
platoon and am in charge of the telephone signalling station with
two signallers. The platoon is camped at the foot of the Canal bank
and our dugout is at the top. We brought a good supply of canteen
tucker with us, and, if the rats don't get it, we are in for a good
time. Spent most of the day making things ship-shape, and now,
having done an hour over my watch of four hours&mdash;it's 1 a.m.
Tuesday, or 0100 in military parlance&mdash;I'll wake Harry C., who
is talking in his sleep. Wilkie is trying to snore his head
off.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, April 25th.</i>&mdash;From the dugout down to the
O.C.'s tent we have rigged up a tight wire, on which we pull up and
let down a jam tin with messages. This saves a lot of sweat running
up and down the steep bank. The O.C. reckons it a good idea, and
we're proud of the job. Four hours on and eight off, swimming and
eating&mdash;Harry's a good cook. This is the life.</p>

<p>The Turks attacked a few miles north of here on the 23rd. Our
aeroplanes go over every day. Camels are used to sweep a broad
smooth track in the sand and this is inspected every morning for
footprints. Sentries patrol this side of the Canal every night and
everything is in readiness for a box-on. A light railway has been
run out about six miles from Ferry Post, and the made roads
continue some few miles beyond the railhead. It is all very
interesting, but I cannot understand why, if there are Turks out
there, we don't go out and have a crack at them.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, April 26th.</i>&mdash;I was pulling a kerosene tin
of water up our tight wire to-day, when the drawing cable snapped
and the tin shot down, throwing its contents all over the O.C., who
was writing a letter below. His complimentary remarks have elevated
me far beyond the status given me by the sergeant. However, he's a
forgiving cuss, as his visit here with cigarettes to-night
proved&mdash;but perhaps that's because he likes our coffee. Anyhow
he tells a good yarn, and I like him very much.</p>

<p>Usual duties and routine to-day. Have just made up my
register&mdash;and now come on, Harry, get these ear-phones on, for
I'm off to bed.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, April 27th.</i>&mdash;Nothing out of the box
to-day. Communications regular and bowels more so.</p>

<p><i>Friday, April 28th.</i>&mdash;Went into Ferry Post and
returned with mail and a parcel from home. Harry's got a ton of
patience&mdash;for over an hour he waited, knife in hand, to stick
a rat, and Wilkie went crook when it bled all over his pack. Harry
is determined to keep me awake to-night, he's making pancakes and
singing "Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake." He's a "babbling brook" all
right, but mostly "babble" when it comes to pancakes.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, April 29th.</i>&mdash;Have had all my clothes in
the sun, so, except for my sun helmet, have been naked all day.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, April 30th.</i>&mdash;Wrote letters home. Received
orders to proceed to staging camp when relieved to-morrow. All good
things come to an end. I wonder how I'll get on when route marching
after three weeks at the school and one week here.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 1st.</i>&mdash;Relieved at Bench Mark 0900, and
marched to staging camp. Had buzzer practice in afternoon and usual
swim. Our colonel is the only one with a swimming costume among the
thousands of naked troops who all get into the water if a passenger
ship goes by. The American ships with their neutral colours, stars
and stripes, plastered from stem to stern attract much attention.
The boys call out: "Got another note from Wilson?" and "Who put the
fish-hooks in our bully?" Warnings were issued in orders some time
ago to look out for fish-hooks in a certain brand of bully-beef
from the Goldarn States.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 2nd.</i>&mdash;Up at 0400 (4 a.m.), leaned rifle
and got ready for brigade march. Fell in and moved off 0500 to
railhead, where we took up our position in a scheme to defend the
Canal. Returned in afternoon and had a good swim.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 3rd.</i>&mdash;Signallers on a battalion
communication scheme in morning and buzzer practice in afternoon.
Another parcel from home&mdash;air pillow, socks, soap, fags, etc.;
the air pillow has given me an idea for the next route
march&mdash;I'll try it out in my pack.</p>

<p>Went to see Rex, Ron, and Reg in the 8th Machine-Gun Company.
But for the flies and their corporal (ex-batman) Toc R., they are
having a good time. It seems that Toc's two "buckshee" stripes got
him a job of which he knows nothing. He makes me feel 100
"disasters" in debt every time I see him. It's just as well for
them they have their own good fellowship to keep them from going
mad in his company. I've never seen Toc in for a swim, but I'll
swear he's got legs on his belly.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 4th.</i>&mdash;Usual routine and less water.
I'm orderly corporal and have just been in charge of a sick parade.
The M.O. ordered m. and d. in every case and, when he had finished,
he said to me: "I wonder how many of those chaps called me a
bastard?" "I wonder," was my only reply. Of course there's always a
big sick parade previous to a route march, yet a few did look crook
to me&mdash;yes, "I wonder."</p>

<p><i>Friday, May 5th.</i>&mdash;Usual long battalion route march.
Put air pillow in my pack instead of its real belongings, which I
buried temporarily in our tent. Too damned tired to walk a mile for
a swim&mdash;where's this blasted war? What are we here for?</p>

<p><i>Saturday, May 6th.</i>&mdash;The whole division went out on a
stunt to-day. The mounted troops seemed to enjoy it very much, but
I reckon I enjoyed my evening pint more than they. I was
complimented on the squareness of my pack, but someone stuck a pin
in it before we returned and now I'm in disgrace.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 7th.</i>&mdash;Another church parade, another
swim, and another bonzer parcel from home: lb. tobacco, soap,
tooth brush, washers, socks, balaclava cap, cheese, chocolate,
sausages, malt, pipe, buttons, pills, bovril, cotton, in fact
everything I want.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 8th.</i>&mdash;Just heard of withdrawal of Turkey
and Bulgaria. Great cheering and excitement in camp. Also news that
French have advanced 17 miles on a 50-mile front. Looks as though
the war's over, worse luck.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 9th.</i>&mdash;That must have been a furphy last
night. I'll bet it came from Rubberneck in the artillery. The 8th
Brigade marched out and "attacked" Hill 147 to-day, and of course
defeated the "enemy."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday May 10th.</i>&mdash;Must be something doing at
last. We hear that Turks have attacked, and battalion has received
orders to be ready to move off at any time. There's much talk and
speculation on events, but housie-housie etc. carry on as
usual.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 11th.</i>&mdash;Received new mark iv
high-velocity rifle and 120 rounds mark vii ammunition. As the
Turks are expected to attack to-morrow, we are preparing to move
off at midnight so that we'll be in time to bid them good
morning.</p>

<p><i>Friday, May 12th.</i>&mdash;The division marched out at 0030
(12.30 a.m.) in artillery formation, but, nothing doing, returned
to camp 0800. Swimming parade in afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, May 13th.</i>&mdash;Only 108 in the shade today,
and no water from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. Received a tin of lollies and
some chewing gum from T.&mdash;God bless her. Am going out on lamp
parade to-night.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 14th.</i>&mdash;Church parade at 7.30 a.m. Rest
of the day in Canal. Two of our boys (one belonging to the 30th
Battalion) were drowned to-day. One was dragged under a liner and
has not been seen since.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 15th.</i>&mdash;Funeral in morning. Heliograph
parade and swim in afternoon. No drinking water all day,
temperature 110. Khamsin blew sand all over the place, the stew
being full of it.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 16th.</i>&mdash;Up at 3 a.m. After a "cup" of
tea, brigade moved off at 4.45 in full marching order (pack, rifle,
120 rounds, etc., about 70 lb. in all). About seven miles out on
the road we turned on to the desert and engaged in a mock attack,
after which we were inspected by the G.O.C. We then did another
attack, running and falling down in the loose sand, before
returning across the desert. About half the battalion fell out on
the way back&mdash;and so did I, about two miles from "home." Just
managed to get to the water tank. Official temperature 115 but
it's been well over 130 in this tent. Lots of chaps have been sent
to hospital.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 17th.</i>&mdash;No parades, for it's too hot.
Official temperature 117, and 122 in our matting hut. Was paid
200 "disasters."</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 18th.</i>&mdash;Like Murdoch's, it's still
rising, but only to 118 official to-day. Damn near dead, and
covered with flies.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 21st.</i>&mdash;Things are better, wind and heat
having dropped and flies are not so sticky. For a week from
to-morrow the battalion will be the Ferry Post garrison. Hope I get
a station on the Canal.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 22nd.</i>&mdash;Ridge Post is like Bench Mark,
only farther from Ferry Post. An underground sap leads to our
underground dugout. Cleaning, renovating, rebuilding, and making a
sandbag table have taken up the day.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 23rd.</i>&mdash;Porridge, fried fish and chips,
cocoa, and toast for breakfast. Connected Steven's phone to
lighthouse. Steak and onions and tin of pears and cream for tea.
What's wrong with this for a week?</p>

<p><i>Friday, May 26th.</i>&mdash;We have a bullet-riddled Turkish
pontoon and a horse to pull it against the current to Ferry Post.
Arriving there to-day to buy provisions we sent the horse back to
Ridge Post and were about to push off on our drift home when a
Tommy lieutenant asked if he could come with us. Sitting in the bow
with his back to us he did not observe the rag plugs being removed,
but, seeing the water rise in the boat, he cried out: "By Jove, we
are sinking, pull for the shore men, pull for the bally shore."
When we were within about ten feet of the bank, he jumped and fell
flat into the water. He was full of water and thanks as we lugged
him out, and as we pushed off again he waved his trousers to us
from the bank.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 28th.</i>&mdash;Scratched my foot in the Canal
last Friday. It looks like a rotten tomato and is throbbing like
the devil. Think it must be poisoned.</p>

<p>Alf went to sleep on duty last night and Sergeant F.'s going
crook a treat&mdash;says I'll have to crime him. Told F. to do his
own dirty work, I've got enough of my own with this foot.</p>

<p>Relieved by Tommies who are taking over Canal defences. Rejoined
battalion and marched to Moascar. Sergeant F. has just told me I'll
have to leave the battalion if I report sick with my foot.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 29th.</i>&mdash;Brigade route march this morning.
Have had to cut a piece out of my boot, and have been putting hot
packs on my trotter for the last hour. Suppose F. has to carry out
his instructions, but I reckon that O.C. Stan would give me some
light duty for a few days if he were here.</p>

<p>Damned if I'll report sick and leave the old battalion.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 30th.</i>&mdash;Another march, and when we get
back to camp F. tells us that he will take off his tunic and fight
any one of us who wants to have him on. That's only his bluff, he's
trying to impress the new chaps in the section. I'll have him on
when I'm ready.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 31st.</i>&mdash;F. took us for another walk
when he could have given us some signal drill instead, and goodness
knows we want it, for most of the section know next to nothing
about signalling.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 1st.</i>&mdash;We have had to throw away all
our clothing except field-service uniform and one change of
underclothing, which is to be packed ready for transport, and we
are to go aboard ship in our drill uniforms. I wonder what the folk
at home would say if they saw us throwing away all their good work.
I have had to part with eighteen pairs of hand-knitted socks that
may have served to prevent "cold feet" in France.</p>

<p>Battalion orders&mdash;morning parade only and day off. Am
writing this in the shade of the water tank near where are supposed
to be the graves of the chaps who died on the recent march from
Tel-el-Kebir. The only evidence of that march is an inscription on
the tank: "Burke and bleeding Wills arrived here 28th March 1916,
thanks to the New Zealanders."</p>

<p>Have just heard that Billy Hughes, when passing through the
Canal, called out to the thousands of naked Aussies in swimming,
"Australia is proud of you boys." "And so they bloody-well ought to
be!" came the reply from the troops as though it had been
rehearsed.</p>

<p><i>Friday, June 2nd.</i>&mdash;The colonel gave us a lecture on
discipline with reference to leaving Egypt and arriving in France.
It seems that we Aussies have a bad name for not saluting. But, if
we are to salute each and every one of the officers we meet in
France, a chap will get the equivalent of housemaid's knee in his
elbow. Our easy way of leaning up against a wall or a post when we
are resting enables us to conserve our energy for when it is
wanted. Can't see how being all the time as stiff as a poker is
going to win the war. We came here to fight for freedom, not to be
slaves to our superiors&mdash;we haven't got any. If I salute an
officer I like to feel that we are exchanging man-to-man
compliments, and I reckon the officers worth saluting feel the same
way. Might be one myself if the war lasts long enough. I'm going to
have a look round the camp and see if I can find some fun.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 3rd.</i>&mdash;Another lecture-parade at which
General Birdwood's message was read out. Got into some fun last
night at a Gyppo's marquee-restaurant where they were selling
rotten food. The boys chucked the niggers out and helped themselves
to the supply of eggs, hundreds of which they broke and cooked on
top of the fire range and then had a fight with the rest.
Afterwards they burnt the joint down. There was an inspection
to-day in search of some hundreds of yards of silk that a Gyppo
says he has lost.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 4th.</i>&mdash;Had all our clothing fumigated
to-day. Attended church parade.</p>

<p><i>Monday, June 5th.</i>&mdash;Route march, and lecture on
discipline in France and on how to distinguish officers and the
compliments to be paid them. Also an interesting talk on how we are
to be billeted with French civilians. A little French home-life
will do us good. Sleeping in a bed and eating at a table will do me
in between battles even if we do have to help wash up. I'll have to
look up a book on French etiquette.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 6th.</i>&mdash;Battalion paraded in full
marching order, and contents of red kit-bags were inspected before
they were sent away by train. Official news of the British naval
victory in the North Sea has been received with great cheering.
That's the stuff to give 'em. Thank God we've got a navy.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 7th.</i>&mdash;A picnic swimming parade to
Ferry Post to-day and lunch in Ismailia Gardens. We had only our
water-bottles and haversacks to carry and all enjoyed the day.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 8th.</i>&mdash;Foot worse than ever.</p>

<p><i>Friday, June 9th.</i>&mdash;Battalion sports to-day.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 10th.</i>&mdash;Brigade sports. I might have
represented the battalion at swimming but for my foot. As there's
no competition for ludo or snakes-and-ladders, I'm out of it.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 11th.</i>&mdash;Still on the outer, but manage
to attend parades. If there's a route march to-morrow, I'll be
marched off to the divisional details camp via hospital.</p>

<p><i>Monday, June 12th.</i>&mdash;Only another lecture on
discipline, entraining, embarking, and routine on board ship. Hope
it's better than the <i>Beltana</i>, but anywhere would be better
than this. We are much shocked at news of the death of Lord
Kitchener, yet some, with a queer sense of humour, have as usual
prompted the Gyppo paper boys to cry out: "Verra good news,
to-morrow's paper, Kitchener dead." In their ignorance the boys do
not even know the name of the man, let alone the wonderful work he
has done for their country.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 13th.</i>&mdash;Memorial service for Lord
Kitchener. Massed bands played the "Dead March," bugles the "Last
Post." Officers wore black armbands&mdash;most impressive.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 14th.</i>&mdash;Divisional sports: 15th
Brigade won by a few points from our 8th Brigade.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 15th.</i>&mdash;Have been packing up and
cleaning camp to-day, and are now ready to march to the station to
entrain for Alexandria. At last, after six months of doing nothing
worth while, we are leaving this land of the three S's, and with
all reverence I say, "Thank God!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI. EGYPT TO FRANCE</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">A soldier's
farewell&mdash;A pleasant cruise&mdash;A trip through
France&mdash;Guns or thunder?</p>

<p class="cp">(16 June&mdash;26 June 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Friday, June 16th 1916.</i>&mdash;Entraining at Moascar about
6.30 last night, sixty men to each long, open truck, we enjoyed
five minutes of sing-song before the long train got under way.</p>

<p class="newspaper">We have written letters to our folk in Aussie
land,<br>
Saying we are leaving Gyppo s&mdash;&mdash; and sin and sand;<br>
We are off to France to fight a much more worthy foe<br>
Than the Gyppo&mdash;from whom we are mighty glad to go.<br>
It's a long way to fight the Fritzie,<br>
Where we might stop a shell;<br>
But before we leave you spielers,<br>
Here's a soldier's last farewell!<br>
Good-bye <i>saida Wallahed!</i><br>
And all your rotten crew;<br>
It's a long, long way to hang the Kaiser,<br>
Good-bye and &mdash;&mdash; you!</p>

<p>This is only one of the many songs we sang on the way. At
Zagazig Junction the Gyppos met us in full force, and as we were
starting off again I bought lemonade. Instead of giving me change
of my "cartwheel" (20 piastres, 4s. 2d.), the Gyppo ran down the
embankment, so I let him have the full bottle fair on the back of
his neck. The boys reckon he's dead. I hope not, but trust it costs
him the twenty piastres to mend his neck.</p>

<p>Arived at Alexandria at 3 a.m.&mdash;roll call all present and
correct. Embarked on H.M.T. <i>Hororata,</i> a 9400-ton vessel of
the New Zealand Shipping Company. The 31st Battalion came on board
later in the morning, and at 4 p.m. the ship moved out into the
stream and anchored.</p>

<p>Have just had our first meal on board (4.45 p.m.). Dinkum
butter, fresh bread and jam, and a mug of tea. Have a bunk to sleep
on, and everything is nice and clean. This ship has a flush deck
from stem to stern. She will crumple up like an egg-shell if a
torpedo finds her. However, we are going to have a good trip, and I
don't mind if we do have a swim in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>How different is our departure from Egypt to the send-off at
Sydney over eight months ago. No one to wave to, no coloured
streamers; just a few dirty Gyppos yelling out for
<i>baksheesh.</i> Nevertheless we are in the best of spirits,
thinking of the future, enjoying the present, and forgetting the
past.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 17th.</i>&mdash;Up at 5 a.m. Had a saltwater
shower, a nice clean shave, and a comfortable toilet. Sailed at 7
a.m. with a naval escort, which looks most businesslike. A good
breakfast of stew, bread and butter, and tea, and then went on duty
on the bridge from 8 a.m. to noon. We have been issued with
life-belts and have to wear them day and night.</p>

<p>Shortly after going on bridge duty I received from our escort a
message: "Have you any late war news?" The skipper gave me a page
of <i>The Egyptian Mail</i> to transmit, but the sergeant insisted
on himself sending it in semaphore. With all the troops on the deck
below gazing at him in amazement, he was waving the red and yellow
flags like a windmill gone mad, when the warship sent this slow and
deliberate message that all could read: "S-i-g-n-a-l
c-o-r-r-e-c-t-l-y." What a cheer went up from the boys.</p>

<p>Every now and then the ship changes course. We are zig-zagging
all over the sea as though Gyppo beer has got into our works. The
dark blue waters are as calm as a mill-pond and we have lost sight
of land.</p>

<p>Have just had dinner&mdash;ROAST BEEF&mdash;and, as I am for
duty from 8 p.m. to midnight on the bridge, I'll have a little
shut-eye before tea.</p>

<p>Feeling the throb of the ship and hearing the wind as it
whistles through the rigging; drinking in the cool fresh salt air
as one peers out over the smooth waters reflecting the light of
heaven, with our ship and escort in utter darkness&mdash;for there
is not a light showing&mdash;makes one feel strangely happy, yet
all the time expecting something to happen. T have just finished my
first night watch of four hours on the bridge, and a delightful
supper in the skipper's galley at that gentleman's invitation. His
steward was much amused at my affectionate interest in a
blue-and-grey enamel tea-pot exactly the same as one at home. Now
I'm off to bed.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 18th.</i>&mdash;Have enjoyed every minute of the
day. Good food, plenty of water to wash in, and much sleep.</p>

<p>The naval escort changes every now and then. As one cruiser is
relieved by another, it just quietly steams away. No fuss, no
cheering, there's no doubt about our navy. It makes us feel even
more secure than if we were crossing George Street. Yet, when the
alarm goes and we have to rush to our boat positions without
knowing if it is dinkum or not, we forget everything but the
life-belt which has become the most important part of our
equipment.</p>

<p>Except for submarine guards, the troops have little to do. We
are all enjoying a good old rest. The peacefulness and soft light
upon the waters is like balm to our eyes strained by glistening
desert sands. In case we grow soft with the life, we wear our boots
for a time each day. I'm glad my foot is on the mend. Usual 8 a.m.
to midday watch, and now for the same to-night.</p>

<p>Received a Morse light message from our escort: "Light showing
port." Thought our skipper would go mad. Don't believe he's been
off duty since leaving Alexandria. It's a big responsibility for
the poor old chap. However, the port-hole has now been dosed and
someone will get it in the neck, in the morning. Just finished
supper, 12.30 a.m.</p>

<p><i>Monday, June 19th.</i>&mdash;Curry and rice for breakfast,
and other meals good-oh. Alarm at 4 p.m. an a couple of shots fired
at a periscope target from our 4.7-inch gun. Usual duties and all's
well.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 20th.</i>&mdash;It's my seventeenth birthday
and a year to-day since I enlisted. What a year, and what a kid I
was then! Feel old enough now to be my father's father. In the
head, I mean; in the body&mdash;well, I'm full of beans. As the
skipper sent me to supper at 10 p.m., I told him the news and he
gave me a pat on the back and called me "son."</p>

<p>Passed Malta at midday. Shower of rain towards nightfall.
Enjoyed the wind and spray on duty to-night.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 21st.</i>&mdash;Rifle inspection, gas-helmet
instruction, and usual duties. Getting used to having a good
time.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 22nd.</i>&mdash;Handed in our summer drill
uniforms and paraded in the good old Aussie uniform and full
marching order. It's now about 7 p.m. and we are approaching
Marseilles. Our escort is a small French torpedo-boat, which is
going round and round us as we steam full speed ahead. The pilot is
taking us through a small break in the submarine nets guarding the
harbour. Marseilles, at the foot of high surrounding hills and with
the Church of Notre-Dame de la Garde perched high upon a peak
overlooking the harbour, makes a most pleasant picture. We are
drawing into the wharf and the boys are cheering a British warship
close by. "What will you do with the Kaiser?" a Jack Tar calls.
"Shoot the cow and &mdash;&mdash;!" is the instant response. Much
laughter and cheering, and we are alongside. There's to be no shore
leave. Only a few troops and Froggie police on the wharf. Oh for a
Gyppo or something to throw a spud at!</p>

<p>Later. Looking at the lights of the city we are cursing our
rotten luck. Here we are within a stone's throw of civilization, a
country whose liberty we will be fighting for within a week, yet we
are not allowed to enjoy one night of its freedom. Suppose they are
afraid we will push the damned place into the sea. All we want is a
walk round the town, a taste of its wine and a look at its
mademoiselles. The hawsers look very tempting, and I'll bet someone
gives it a go. Blast this war and all its brass-hats, I'm off to
bed.</p>

<p><i>Friday, June 23rd.</i>&mdash;The time is 7 p.m. (it does not
get dark until about 9 o'clock), and we are about to disembark.</p>

<p>With our band playing the regimental march, we left the wharf
about 7.30 p.m. The streets were thronged with people who cheered
us on our way, yet some of the women and old men were weeping.
Children raced and fought to get near the band. We had to laugh at
one youngster who took down his pants but soon regained the twenty
paces he had lost. When the "Marseillaise" was played, I thought
the Froggies were all going mad. Their national anthem is the most
inspiring martial music I have ever heard, but to hear it in such a
setting and feel it in one's bones&mdash;well, it's the most
thrilling experience I have ever had. How easy it would be to fight
and die to the accompaniment of such grand music. Though. I have
seen little or nothing of Marseilles, the welcome of its lovable
people and their expressions of goodwill will ever remain one of my
happiest memories.</p>

<p>We entrained in comfortable carriages, ten men to a compartment,
and started off about 10 p.m. on our trip of three nights and two
days in the train. Looking back as we climbed the mountains, the
lights of the city and the harbour and its ships reminded me of
home, and I wondered what my folk were thinking and doing at the
time. Then, as the train entered a long tunnel, my thoughts went to
its opening and the experiences ahead.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 24th.</i>&mdash;It must have been in the hours
of morning when I fell asleep, for I did not wake until in broad
daylight we pulled up at Orange for breakfast. The meal, though it
included tinned butter, was a secondary consideration to our
surroundings. Many people called and waved to us over the railway
fence, and, not understanding their lingo other than <i>"Vive l'
Australie!"</i> we answered them in English and Arabic and
exchanged long-distance kisses with the fairer sex.</p>

<p>About an hour and off we went again. The train is an
exceptionally long one and some of the chaps are taking walking
exercises on the roof. The old French soldiers guarding the railway
draw their hands across their throats to warn the roof-walkers of
overhead wires. As the train goes slowly on, I have seen a few
chaps hop off near the engine and jump on as the last carriage goes
past.</p>

<p>Travelling through the Rhne Valley with its beautiful river
winding through the richly cultivated countryside, we see only
women and old men at work in the fields. They wave and throw kisses
to us as we go by, and we cheer and sing and are sometimes quiet as
we look out on the living beauty of the landscape. Scarlet poppies
and blue cornflowers mingle with the ripe golden crops; green
trees, vineyards, and farms extend to the tops of the hills where
an occasional castle is seen; tall poplars or spreading
mulberry-looking trees line the roadways and countless streams flow
everywhere. To think man is fighting and war is raging amidst such
heavenly-endowed country; it's damnably wicked and beyond one's
understanding. But this country is threatened by a stronger nation.
Is not the freedom of these happy people in their delightful
country worth fighting for? I think so after all.</p>

<p>We have had a brief stop, and I, like others, have gathered a
bunch of flaming red poppies. What kids we are!</p>

<p>At Lyons, one of the largest cities in France, our train stopped
on the embankment at the entrance to the station. The people in the
street below gave us a most enthusiastic greeting, and then by way
of response Les W. played the "Marseillaise" on his cornet. What
singing! What cheering! The like I have never heard. Throwing their
hats in the air, the Frenchies went wild with excitement and tossed
us cigarettes and fruit in abundance. They seem to like our tripey
song, "Australia Will be There."</p>

<p>Continuing north, but now with the river to the east, we do not
tire of looking out from our confinement on the ever unfolding
countryside with its red-roofed farmhouses dotted among the green.
Our second meal of the trip was enjoyed at Macon Fhen, where
troughs of clear water were provided for our toilet. It was not
until the passing of twilight, when darkness cloaked the wondrous
views, that we settled down to talk of the fullness of the day. And
then the wheels, as they beat rhythmically over the rail joints,
counted us off to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 25th.</i>&mdash;Another day of scenic beauty,
laughter, cheering, and singing. We passed to the west of Paris,
seeing only the top of the Eiffel Tower. A passing hospital train
with wounded; a gang of German prisoners, looking happy enough, at
work on the railway; the twisted remains of an aeroplane, and some
old trenches and wire-entanglements, served to remind us of the
war.</p>

<p>At Duvere we had tea. Here, in a long train of wooden trucks
each painted <i>Hommes 40 Chevaux 8</i> in large letters, we met
some French soldiers who treated us well of their wine. Holding the
goatskin wine-bag above your bent-back head, you squeeze its thin
stream into your gaping mouth. A number of charming girls gathered
at the picket fence gave us to understand they were celebrating
some national day. They called me "enfant piccaninny," and when the
boys passed me over the fence, they gave me more kisses than I
might normally have had in the last seven months. Of course there
was much laughter as I blushingly clambered back over the fence,
but, if the boys like that form of amusement, they can have some
more gladly at my expense.</p>

<p>We have now been on this train for more than forty-eight hours
and it has just dawned on me that I have not used, nor heard, one
swear word in all that time. That's environment, no doubt. I've
never thought of it before, yet, when one comes to think of it, I
dare say old Nick would be much the same as us if he were suddenly
wafted into Heaven. According to my calculations and with the aid
of my compass, I reckon we are approaching the coast near the
English Channel. Most of the boys are sleeping so I'll follow
suit.</p>

<p><i>Monday, June 26th.</i>&mdash;Arrived at Hazebrouck at about 8
o'clock this morning. Detrained at Morbecque and here we are,
billeted in a barn with a couple of pigs next door. The host has
not yet put in an appearance. I'm told that he's too busy over the
way at the farmhouse, which he has converted into a pub. Judging by
the number of troops going in there, it must be the correct thing
for one to seek out mine host.</p>

<p>I'm waiting for Eric to come back from Battalion Headquarters,
also situated at this farm. There's plenty of clean straw in the
barn, and I think it will be quite comfortable&mdash;yet how
different from what we expected! Already we have made the billet
shipshape; that's always the first thing we do upon taking up new
quarters. Old Jim S. is fussing about the place like a clucky hen
and is speculating on how long it will take the chats, already in
evidence, to multiply their population of the barn. Jim's a good
old sport&mdash;he's just offered to fix me up a possie <i>if</i> I
want to get off to the village. I'm set, however, for Alf and I
have taken up residence on the ten-by-ten-foot hay loft above the
door.</p>

<p>This undulating district is an agricultural one, but is not
nearly so attractive as the southern country of France. Nor are the
folk as interested in us as were their southern countrymen. At
least, that is my first impression, and, as the war has been raging
hereabout for two years, the peasants cannot be expected to enthuse
about us.</p>

<p>Just now we heard a distant rumble. Jim looked at me, I looked
at Jim. "Guns," said Jim. "Thunder," said I. But it's guns all
right, a shade north of east from here and about twenty miles away.
So we are getting near the Big Smoke at last! Well that can wait,
but not so Eric, who from across the "field" is loudly calling
<i>"talaheena igri!"</i> (Arabic for "come quickly"). So here goes
for my first night off the chain in France.</p>

<p class="cp">(26 June-9 July 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 27th 1916.</i>&mdash;Last night&mdash;what a
night! What a day, and what a fat head! Our host turned out to be a
hostess. We call her "Madame" (her old man's at <i>la guerre),</i>
and Yvonne and Marie, her daughters, help in the <i>estaminet.</i>
It may have been the fashion two years ago to billet you with the
family, and, if so, that's probably why it has changed since. Fancy
having your legs under the same table as Yvonne and Marie and
Madame, and the old bloke away at the war. And fancy getting into
bed with nice white sheets and&mdash;well, just waking up to find
it's all a dream.</p>

<p>Yes, what a night. The others had about an hour start on us, but
we soon picked up Madame, Yvonne, and Marie&mdash;their names I
mean&mdash;and also <i>bon jour, estaminet, vin blanc, vin rouge,
oeuf, pain, bire, trs bon,</i> and a few other words I forget. In
fact my memory is not at all clear, and I'm at a loss to know when
and how I climbed up the pole to the loft. The kids have also
picked up some of our language&mdash;"baksheesh souvenir."</p>

<p>Had a chap knowingly been going to his funeral on the morrow, he
could not have helped but forget it in the exhilarating atmosphere
of that <i>estaminet.</i> The homely figure of Madame, her comely
daughters, her delightful drinks and food, rushed straight to our
heads. Singing all the old songs and the latest "Mademoiselle from
Armentires" with as many verses as the Aussie pianist cared to
play, we hurried over our drinks so that Yvonne and Marie might be
near us the more. Nine o'clock and the picket came all too soon to
turn us out into the night air which finished off events so far as
I was concerned. I'm told there was a heavy bombardment last night,
but can't say I heard it.</p>

<p>We have had an easy day to-day, only early morning parade. The
rest of the time I have spent poking around the village. Most
interesting, but I'll write of that to-morrow. It's evening now,
about 8 p.m. and as light as day. Some stunting aeroplanes have
just gone over. I'm told it is the squadron commanded by the "Mad
Major."</p>

<p>Later. It's about midnight. There's a war here all right, and a
fair-sized one, too, judging by the continuous noise of guns and
the reflection out east. The throbbing of my foot awakened me. As I
write with the aid of my torch I can hear the heavy breathing of
those below, the rumble in the distance, the gnawing of a rat, the
gentle patter of rain, and a few grunts from the pig next door.
Somehow I feel irresistibly drawn towards that distant low yet
heavy sound, boom-boom-boom, but perhaps that's only because of my
inexperience. In any case, 'twould be better if I slept.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 28th.</i>&mdash;Very few duties; raining all
day.</p>

<p>In the short while that we have been here, I have been able to
see quite a lot of the neighbourhood and it's people. The village
of Morbecque, with its cobblestone street and old barn-like
buildings, might have been in pre-war days the setting for that
quaint little song "In an Old Fashioned Town." To-day, however,
every second shop is an <i>estaminet,</i> and the others are mostly
bakers', where we buy long loaves of wholesome French bread. One
side of the main thoroughfare is taken up with a British
motor-transport company, apparently in permanent residence. Troops,
mainly of our brigade, are everywhere.</p>

<p>At the top of the street there's a homely little shop where a
wrinkled old lady in snow-white cap, embroidered dress, and
old-world shawl, sells souvenir postcards worked in silks, and
other flimsy gifts. How clumsy and awkward one feels in such
presence as one hesitates to touch her dainty wares. Even G., our
battalion roughneck, looked different as his big pugilistic mit
took delivery of a delicate little "hanky" embroidered "Mother."
Troops in twos and threes wander into the <i>estaminets</i> from
which they later emerge arm in arm, singing and laughing, and on
they go. A picket goes past, with the arrested combatants of some
drunken brawl, and then, because my cash is at a low ebb, I decide
to have a look at the countryside.</p>

<p>Cycling along the poplar or hedge-lined cobble-paved roads, with
old stone whitewashed farm buildings and outhouses grouped here and
there, one observes the holdings to be very small. The intensely
cultivated fields of almost uniform crops are mostly without
dividing fences, so that the stranger is unable to determine the
boundaries of a farm. Reaching the top of a slight rise and
dismounting at the cross-roads, I was much interested in a simple
little wayside shrine. To this rustic wooden crucifix&mdash;there
are many in the district&mdash;the peasants come to worship with
the dawn. Though not of the faith, I feel their lowly little
shrines to be more appropriate for worship than the palatial
churches.</p>

<p>Saluting a pretty milkmaid attired in white cap and coloured
shawl, I might also have saluted the sturdy dog drawing, without
apparent effort, the small yet heavy-looking cart. My admiration
has, however, turned to sympathy for the dogs since I saw one
providing the motive power for a butter churn. Pulling a cart or
running in a treadwheel, his tail has long lost the art of
wagging.</p>

<p>The peasants in their rough wooden clogs appear to be simple
folk, working long hours and enjoying little of the pleasures we
call life. Except those with whom we do business in the shops and
<i>estaminets,</i> we find this people to be reserved and more or
less indifferent to us and the close-by rumblings of war. Yet some
of the boys, perhaps more sociable than I, have made friendships by
helping at a pump, or by using a sickle have won the favour of a
woman harvesting in her field.</p>

<p>Peeping through neatly curtained windows, one glimpses the
extreme cleanliness of the homes. Spotless tiled floors, and highly
polished metals, simple furnishings and large comfortable-looking
beds, snow-white linen and coloured drapings, a few pictures and a
little shrine make the peasants' home and happiness. Our entrance
to the dwellings is not allowed, and as I cannot
<i>parlez-vous,</i> I must wait some later opportunity of making
myself more familiar with the character and habits of the
French.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 29th.</i>&mdash;The battalion went for a short
route march this morning. It was long enough to remind us that our
condition has suffered as a result of the trip and change of
climate. It has reminded me, too, that I should have been nursing
my foot instead of having a good time.</p>

<p><i>Friday, June 30th.</i>&mdash;Route march cancelled owing to
rain. As orderly corporal I have been kept busy to-day. Australian
and English mails received, but none for me. Gas-helmet parade in
the afternoon. Saw shells bursting near aeroplanes this evening,
but the machines were too far away for us to know to which side
they belonged. The billet smells most unpleasant this steaming wet
weather. Everything is damp. Most of the boys are busy "chatting."
I'm broke, but Eric's got a few francs, so we are now going to
enjoy a little music in the <i>estaminet.</i></p>

<p><i>Saturday, July 1st.</i>&mdash;Route march and gas parade.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 2nd.</i>&mdash;Church parade in the morning.
Issued with gas-helmets and goggles in the afternoon. The
gas-helmet, a grey cloth bag with a rubber mouthpiece valve and two
glass windows, makes you feel like a bogyman when you put it on,
but when, after two minutes' wear, the stinking chemical almost
chokes you and vapour forms on the windows, you feel like the
bogyman's victim. The goggles with sponge rubber protection are for
use in tear-gas clouds to stop you from crying for home and mother.
What with all the instruction and warnings we have had about gas, I
have got the wind up. Of material things such as bullets, bombs,
and shells I'm not a bit windy, but gas, well it's just too
unearthly and ghostly to me. This gas gear we keep in a waterproof
satchel, and woe betide the chap who is found without one.</p>

<p>There's a particularly loud bombardment going on just now. If it
continues until dark we'll see a nice firework display out
yonder.</p>

<p><i>Monday, July 3rd.</i>&mdash;Another game of gas, only this
time with the real thing. We have been marched through a gas-cloud
with helmets on, and through a tear-cloud without goggles. The tear
gas has a fruity smell and stings your eyes like the devil. I
suppose this little demonstration is meant to give us confidence,
and by the same token I should not be surprised if our artillery
are given a few practice shots at us now we have our steel
helmets.</p>

<p>The tin hat with its rubber cushioned inner band and strong
leather "chin strap" worn at the back of the head makes one feel as
safe as an armoured car. It will make a good candle rest and a
strong room for your cash if you've got any.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 4th.</i>&mdash;We signallers, because we have
to remain at our dugout posts, have been issued with special gas
box-respirators. The whole is contained in a khaki haversack which
is suspended on the chest by a strap going round the neck. It
consists of a charcoal air-filter chamber to which is connected a
collapsible tube, with a mask attached at the end. The mask clips
on to the nose and covers the mouth, and so leaves free the rest of
the face except the goggle-covered eyes. It's an improvement on the
gas-helmet and looks much more imposing.</p>

<p>The whole of the 5th Division is now in this area, and I hear
that our old O.C. (Stan E.) is now a platoon officer in the 53rd
Battalion. He's much too keen a soldier to have remained a
glorified office boy on Divisional Headquarters.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, July 5th.</i>&mdash;Another march and the usual
routine. A potato crop disappeared overnight and our comforts fund
has to foot the bill. Spuds cooked in the coals of a fire are
good-oh.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, July 6th.</i>&mdash;Paid at 10 a.m. Chucked out of
<i>estaminet</i> between 10 and 11 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Friday, July 7th.</i>&mdash;A convenient storm has just
caused us to return from a route march. We are preparing to move
towards the front to-morrow. And now to eat, drink, and be merry,
for to-morrow never comes.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, July 8th.</i>&mdash;We have arrived at Estaires
after a most trying march of over fifteen miles. The full infantry
equipment with blankets is a bad enough load, but when in addition
you have a field telephone and a box-respirator flogging you at
every step, it's the last straw that breaks the signaller's back.
The brigade column was longer than the distance between
<i>estaminets</i>, and, because the heads in their wisdom
considered it inadvisable to halt the brigade while any section of
it was within coo-ee of an <i>estaminet,</i> we had a forced march.
As our feet are used to treading on soft sand, each jarring step on
the hard rough cobble <i>pav</i> was torture. Most of the 29th
Battalion and a number of our mob fell out of the march.</p>

<p>When we finally came to a halt, my morningafter-the-night-before
thirst remained unquenched because the madame of a roadside farm
refused to lend me the handle of her pump. So, instead, I removed
my boots and gave my feet a drink in the stagnant water of the
ditch. As my swollen feet would not then fit into my boots, I had
to resume the march like a youngster coming home from school on a
wet day. After a few miles of marching in this fashion my feet were
bleeding freely, and I was about to give way to that surging
feeling in my head and chest that kept saying "fall out" "fall out"
when the adjutant, Captain S., offered me a lift on his horse. It
was all I could do to muster sufficient strength to pull myself
into the saddle, and once there I let the charger have his head. Of
course the animal resumed his place alongside the colonel at the
head of the battalion. And so, with bare feet and a puttee trailing
in the dirt, I shared with our immaculate colonel the honour of
leading "our" bttalion into Estaires. The boys reckon this was the
only joke of the day.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the only joke of the last twenty-four hours
they have on me. We gave ourselves a great send-off party from
Morbecque last night. The grog must have been extra good, or
perhaps I allowed it to have its way. It seems that I have
established myself as a comic singer, a clog dancer, an
elocutionist, a conjurer, and a clown all in one night. How I found
the courage to step into the role of <i>estaminet</i> entertainer
is beyond me, but once there I received much encouragement. "What
do we want?" "More" the boys shouted. <i>"Encore enfant
caporal"</i> Madame kept calling, while Marie and Yvonne showed
their appreciation with shining eyes when their glass- and
bottle-laden hands did not permit clapping. It must have been good
wine they gave me, at least up to then. Free wine was not my only
compensation. I had the privilege of dining alone with Yvonne and
was making good progress with my affectionate advances, when Madame
called us both back to work so that Marie and the Aussie pianist
might have their turn at the supper table. The rest of the evening
fell flat. The boys counted me out before I had finished my next
number, and Madame and the girls seemed to lose interest in me when
I failed to draw custom to their house. A bottle of champagne
failed to have the desired effect. The noise of laughter and
singing became just a dull roar in my ears and my vision became
more and more hazy until consciousness completely left me as I was
being carried back to our barn.</p>

<p>It was most considerate of the boys to carry me home, but they
made the mistake of putting me to bed in the wrong "room," where in
the early hours of the morning I awakened to find my bed companion
grunting and kicking her objections&mdash;they had put me to bed
with the pig.</p>

<p>Have just bathed and dressed my feet, and have cut my gas mask
satchel into a waterproof bandage to keep the dirt out of the Gyppo
cut which has opened up again. We are billeted in the school, and
from here, where I am going to stay until it's time to march again
to-morrow, I can see children playing games. They have a gas mask
each, the satchel pinned to their clothes. Poor little devils, it's
a damned shame they should have to live so near the front line,
which is only five miles away.</p>

<p>We have received orders that there's to be no falling out on the
march to-morrow. We are to remember that we are marching into
action&mdash;as though we thought it a picnic we are going to. I'll
be glad to get there and settle down to a little fighting, instead
of marching, for my country. Some of the boys reckon I should go
sick with my foot, but I'm saving it up until after the first
stunt, when it might be a good excuse for a little rest. Lying back
here on my pack, with feet resting on a stool, I'm feeling much
better, but think I'll give the <i>estaminets</i> a miss for
to-night. Had enough <i>estaminet</i> last night to do me for a
while, but I wouldn't mind being in Madame's parlour again just
now. I wonder what Yvonne and Marie will do with that box full of
"rising suns?" I'm sure they appreciated best my gift tins of
bully-beef. What kisses, and even from Madame, and then, fancy
sleeping with the pig!</p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 9th.</i>&mdash;As we marched out of Estaires
this morning Brigadier-General Tivey took the salute at the corner
where we turned east, and after a seven-mile march we arrived at
Jesus Farm. The farm consists of a number of small huts on the bank
of a canal, and as it is only three miles from the front we have to
keep in the huts as much as possible. Looking out over the
battle-scarred landscape, we see the bursting shells, the
pock-marked ground, the screen camouflaged roads, battered and
shell-holed buildings, splintered trees, and old trenches and
entanglements. Yet some peasants are working in their fields, and
it seems incredible that we are within easy range of Fritz's
shells. As I have been detailed to go into the front line to-morrow
with an advance party consisting of an officer and several N.C.Os,
Jack F., who has been treating me better of late, allowed me to go
for a ride in a limber to Armentires. It was a run of only two
miles, yet not without incident. We helped ourselves to a jar of
rum from an Army Service wagon that had stopped a shell, and then,
arriving at the much battered town, we were just in time for a
little shooting match, entering an <i>estaminet</i> as Madame, with
babe under her arm, fled calling out <i>"Allemand bombarde!"</i> We
followed her a little later, and as we rushed for a cellar a
youngster of some ten or twelve years plainly chided our fright. He
quickly followed us, however, when a shell, with ear-splitting
crash, tore a huge hole in a foot thick wall near by.</p>

<p>I was glad to get back to Jesus Farm. In the fading light both
sides must be enjoying an evening nap, for, except for the noise of
a few bursting antiaircraft shells and our planes coming home, all
is quiet and peaceful. That little drop of rum has given me a warm
and pleasant glow, and now to clean my rifle.</p>

<p class="cp">(10 July-19 July 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Monday, July 10th 1916.</i>&mdash;It is now 4.30 p.m. and I
have everything in readiness to leave here at 1700 (5 p.m.) for the
front line at Bois-Grenier. As the only signaller of the party (a
company commander and six others), it is my job to make myself
familiar with the lines of communication before the battalion takes
over to-morrow night. I will then be in charge of a section of
signallers. After the months of training we find ourselves to be
without company signallers, so H.Q. signallers have to supply all
requirements. It was decent of Jack to ask me if I would take on
the job instead of ordering me to do so. It will be an experience.
I wonder what it will be like? Looks all, right from here.</p>

<p>Connected a phone here to-day, have had a sleep and have again
cleaned my 120 rounds and rifle. The rifle is as bright and shiny
as the eyes of Yvonne. I wonder if I'll put it to proper use? All
hands are busy with equipment. There is an air of suppressed
excitement and all are in the best of spirits. I've an idea the
boys envy me going in to-night, though one has just asked if I am
writing my will and another is concerned about the fate of my
pants. (I'm reminded of packing up to go camping for Eight Hour
week-end in 1913, and, as then, I'm wondering if I've got
everything. We went to Narrabeen, Bob bought a pipe, burnt the back
out of his coat, set fire to our hired tent, and it rained all
night. Going camping for pleasure is like joining the army for
pastime, it's nice to look forward to and good to look back on.)
Now it's time to go and have a look at the Great War&mdash;'twill
be a change to have something to write home about.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 11th.</i>&mdash;1800 or 6 p.m., c/o Aunt Sally,
Bois-Grenier (place C. 17, to be correct). But first to go over the
last twenty-five hours since leaving Jesus Farm.</p>

<p>Leaning against a wall, we are awaiting the major. A few cobbers
are giving cheerful advice: "What kind of flowers do you want on
your grave, Aussie?" "We'll write and tell 'em what you did in the
Great War, Daddy." Yet, there's a "something" dinkum one feels in
the air of this soldier's farewell. Here comes the major, he's been
enjoying a little party. "Fall in and follow me, gentle flock," he
says, and, laughing, we understand.</p>

<p>Walking in single file behind the major, he keeps us well
entertained, and shouts us a drink at the last <i>estaminet.</i> We
soon leave the cultivated fields behind. We are now in the
shell-ploughed area, ruined houses and&mdash;bang! What was that?
Only the bark of an 18-pounder from its cover a few yards away on
our left. It silences us for a while. The sharp explosions of
occasional whizz-bangs become plainer, a large shell gives off much
black smoke as it goes "crump" on our right, and a few of ours
whistle overhead. We come to some crossroads, lie back on our packs
for a spell, and when the major's cane ceases its devil's tattoo on
a cobblestone it is again time to get on our way.</p>

<p>We are now treading along a duckboard track, but the major has
lost the way, and we find ourselves in the rear support line of the
13th Battalion. While the major is receiving directions, I inquire
of a sergeant: "Do you know Arthur W. in this battalion?" "No," he
says, "ask that chap over there, he has just come from the front
line." It is not necessary to ask, however, for it is Arthur
himself. How different he looks, yet little wonder, for he has just
been sent out with shell-shock from a dugout where five were
killed. What a wreck he looks! He hardly knows me. "Well, so long;
keep your legs together, Arthur," is my farewell to him, and I'm
glad to be again on the duckboard track.</p>

<p>The sides of the narrow winding sap are sufficiently high to
give us cover. A few bullets sing gently over our heads and the
burst of a shell sounds not far away. We have not long passed a
support trench when we come to a halt. The word is passed back,
"Keep low and run across" The sap has been blown in. It comes my
turn to run. I try to pull my tin hat down over my ears, and make a
crouching rush across the open space. The smell of sulphur fumes
indicates that the damaging shell has not long since burst. It
occurs to me that we might have been in time to meet the shell if
the major had not lost the way. That short run, or perhaps the
necessity for it, has quickened my pulse and breathing, and I am
uncomfortably out of breath when we come to some sand-bag works to
left and right.</p>

<p>This is the front line. Here we see three chaps "chatting." One
remarks: "Here come the Marmalades." Another calls: "Look out,
Fritz! Here's Tivey's Chocs! Spare me blooming days" We grin and
try and think of a commonplace reply to these veterans of Jacka's
Mob. One of our number finds voice to say: "Hello! Where's this war
we've heard about?"</p>

<p>"We've just knocked off for afternoon tea, sorry you're late,"
replies one of the "chatters," and they all laugh at our antics as
a whizz-bang whistles over our heads.</p>

<p>Going to the left we see a notice, "Watson's Bay," which causes
our smiles to look and feel more natural. After we cover about 300
yards of the front, two officers greet our major and we know that
we have reached the company headquarters of the post. While
awaiting instructions we lie back on our packs and watch the shells
bursting round an aeroplane. We are debating whether it is one of
ours or one of theirs. Whiz-z-z! Instinct tells us that something
solid is approaching from the sky. Smack! We all scramble. I rush
into the nearest dugout and am greeted with "What the Hell's the
hurry, Grandpa?" by a signaller who looks at me as though it was I
who had just arrived from the clouds.</p>

<p>"What! Didn't you hear that chunk of shell?" I gasp.</p>

<p>"Christ! That's nothing. You'll soon get used to that," he
answers reassuringly. "If you're taking over C. 17 you've come to
the right place. Better drop your pack and put your rifle over
there."</p>

<p>He thinks I have "dropped my bundle." I make an effort to hide
my fear. I carelessly throw my tin hat into a corner, ask the
signaller what part of Aussie he comes from, and try to keep a
steady hand as I offer him a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Hey! Look what's here" he shouts, to wake the corporal on the
sand-bag bunk.</p>

<p>The corporal gives a grunt, stretches and rubs his eyes. "What!
The War Babies Brigade! Thank God we've got a navy."</p>

<p>And then, deciding that it is time to assert myself,</p>

<p>I invite the corporal to kiss the baby's &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Good for you," says the signaller, as he makes a bayonet swipe
at a rat running near his phone. "That's the stuff to give 'im.
Here! take a seat and make yourself at home."</p>

<p>"Seems a nice quiet place," I venture.</p>

<p>"Not bad," says the corporal, "till you stir up Fritz's
hate."</p>

<p>With some display of indifference I manage to make a few
inquiries and learn that except for mending busted cables and doing
telephone duty&mdash;four hours on and eight off&mdash;the
signaller's job in this possie is "sweet." The dugout is almost
shrapnel-proof: only a direct hit or a shell-burst near the opening
can do any harm. They have not had many casualties. The tucker is
pretty good, there is a cook-house in the line. My own observations
tell me that rats and chats are numerous, and the smell of the
place is anything but sweet.</p>

<p>While the corporal winds his puttees, the signaller gives me
instructions how to plug the telephone to H.Q., C. 10, and
artillery on their home-made switchboard. He is having a telephone
conversation with some signaller of another post on the subject of
Tivey's "Chocolates" having arrived at the war, when the corporal
calls from outside: "Come on, young'un, I'll take you round the
show!"</p>

<p>About ten paces from the dugout we come to a parapet, and
asking, "What's over there?" I step up for a look. I am roughly
pulled down and fall in a heap at the corporal's feet.</p>

<p>"You silly young blighter," he says, "do you want to stop some
lead? Fritz! That's what's over there. Here! here's a periscope;
have a look at No Man's Land." Then to prove his words and
illustrate his meaning, he puts my hat on a stake and holds it over
the top. Zip! the first bullet hits the parapet. Ping-g-g! the
second ricochets off the target, and my respect for Fritz and tin
hats is enhanced.</p>

<p>We visit Pyman's Corner and this inspires the corporal to call
me Simon. "Come on, Simon," he calls when I am trying to add a
nosecap to the collection of metal that already fills my pockets,
"you'll want a G.S. wagon to carry your souvenirs if you keep that
up." We trace the phone cable along Sniper's Alley and I learn that
the zip-zip-zip-zip! on the sand-bags is the shooting of "Parapet
Joe." "He's a dabster with the machine-gun," the corporal observes,
and I feel that Joe can see us as we go along the sap.</p>

<p>It is almost dark. I keep close behind the corporal as he leads
the way back. I have almost convinced myself that I am accustomed
to the new surroundings, and am thinking how proud my people would
feel if they could see me now when&mdash;flash! bang! right near my
ear, and I fall flop on the duckboard.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha" I hear, and, looking up, see a chap preparing to
fire another flare. "Ha! ha! That's the idea, sonny, you know how
to duck. Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>I regain my feet, but fail to appreciate the joke, and decide
that the vital question is to know when, rather than how, one
should duck.</p>

<p>But for the moving illumination of flares, it is dark when we
arrive back at C. 17. The corporal tells his signaller that I am
getting on fine, and he advises an artillery officer sitting on the
bunk that I have expressed a wish to go out spotting. That's news
to me, but, remembering my resolution not to show any fear, I
decide to give it a go, though I know nothing of the job. I am
rather reluctant to leave my tin hat, but accept their advice and
pull a Balaclava cap over my head.</p>

<p>"No! You won't want your rifle," says the corporal. "Take a
bayonet for an earth pin. Here's your phone. Be careful where you
lay the line."</p>

<p>"Prussian Guards over there," remarks the signaller, with a
grin; "you might collect a souvenir bonnet." He picks up a drum of
cable, takes hold of his end and, giving me the drum, says: "Here
you are, don't forget to bring it back."</p>

<p>They might have wished a man good luck, I think as I pay out the
cable and endeavour to keep close on the heels of the officer. He
comes to a halt, says something to a sentry, and tells me to come
on. We crawl through a little opening called a sally-port and,
realizing that I am now in No Man's Land, I follow him and, as far
as possible, imitate his every action. I hold my breath and do not
so much as move an eyelid when a flare lights up our surroundings.
We come to our wire-entanglement, go to the left, and pass through
an opening in the maze of wires. Going out half-right along a
depression in the ground, I am anxiously trying to calculate the
length of cable left on the drum when the glare of a flare
temporarily blinding my vision, I stumble and fall into a
water-filled shell-hole.</p>

<p>The cold water adds to my shivering condition, and my fingers
tremble as I connect the phone when we establish ourselves in a
shell-hole observation-post. The boss gives me the impression that
he has been doing this kind of work all his life. Although-he
inspires some confidence, I stand at the alert with one eye cocked
in the direction of Fritz and my kicking-off foot pointing towards
home. The business of our mission seems quite simple. The boss
scans the landscape ahead through his glasses, observes what he
believes to be Germans mending their trench, and sends a range
message to his battery. A shell or two comes whizzing over and I
can almost swear that I see bits of Fritzes in the flash of the
explosion. It is some time before I am able to convince myself that
the moving shadows caused by the flares are not a host of Germans.
Our little game goes on into the night...</p>

<p>To the left I see a solid-looking figure moving, but am afraid
to point it out to the boss in case he thinks I've got the wind up.
Then I see two more in the same direction&mdash;they seem to be
coming towards us. The boss sees them, too, and we crouch down so
as just to peep over the edge of our crater. I wish I had my rifle
as I see a Fritz in silhouette against the light of a falling
flare. But nothing happens. They disappear in the darkness that
follows.</p>

<p>I am just beginning to kid myself that I like this game of
pilgrims of the night when the time comes to go home. As we make
our way back, an occasional burst of machine-gun fire breaks out
and a few flares go up. In my endeavour to keep up with the boss I
have trouble in rewinding the wire on to the drum, and I am
sweating freely by the time we reach the sally-port.</p>

<p>"Thank you, corporal," says my companion of the night, as he
presents me with a tin of fags. "Good night!"</p>

<p>The signallers are playing cards when I arrive at the
dugout.</p>

<p>"Well, how'd you like it, Simon?" asks the corporal.</p>

<p>"Oh! not bad&mdash;pretty tame," I answer.</p>

<p>"Simon! 'Struth! Ned Kelly, don't you mean?" remarks a signaller
who is a stranger to me.</p>

<p>"Ananias, more like it," chips in the signaller of my
acquaintance, and then proceeds to help himself and treat his
cobbers to the gift tin of Gold Flake cigarettes I have placed on
the table.</p>

<p>I am not slow to accept the corporal's offer of his bunk for a
spell, nor is it long before I fall off to sleep.</p>

<p>Yes, that about covers yesterday, or rather the last seven hours
of it. Strange to say, I slept well. In fact I had to be awakened
at "stand to." Have been busy all day inspecting and mending phone
lines. According to the 14th Battalion chaps, this afternoon's
strafe from Fritz was unusually heavy. It consisted mostly of
whizz-bangs which landed back in the support line, though a dud
shell, from which I am going to get the copper driving band,
dislodged a number of sand-bags near this dugout. Waiting for it to
burst seemed like ages, but it could only have been a few moments
before someone shouted "Dud" The corporal and I stopped a fair
issue of mud from a shell-burst as we were mending a broken cable.
The mud sticks like a poor relation.</p>

<p>When our battalion takes over to-night it will have to hold a
front of about 1000 yards. As that represents only about a
one-thousandth part of the Western Front, it is difficult to form
an opinion as to how the war is progressing. Judging by the state
of the trenches here, with grass and crops growing about the place,
I should say there's been very little change for some time. As the
land is very marshy, breastworks of sand-bags, supported by wooden
stays, wire-netting, and brushwood, have been built. There are good
dugouts or sand-bag cubby-houses in which to shelter, and well laid
duckboards connect up the whole system. Of course the place is
lousy with "livestock," and there are millions of rats. The space
between front line and supports is, like No Man's Land, just a mass
of shell-holes mostly filled with stinking stagnant water. Pulling
a cable out of one of them we disturbed some of its
secrets&mdash;no wonder the rising vapour is so heavily laden. We
labelled this particular hole "4711."</p>

<p>It seems queer to see birds hopping and chirping in this
otherwise wholly unnatural place. Even the sky with anti-aircraft
shells by day, and flares and rockets by night, is changed.</p>

<p>I wanted something different to write about, and for the last
four hours that's what I have been trying to do in between
receiving and sending messages. Expect my signallers to arrive any
time now. I'll be sorry, for more than one reason, to lose the
company of these 14th chaps, fine lot of fellows that they are.</p>

<p>The machine-guns are very busy to-night. I wonder if Fritz knows
of the relief. I'm told there are lots of spies behind our
lines&mdash;they are supposed to signal to the Germans by using
different kinds of farm implements in various ways by day and with
window blinds by night. It does seem strange that peasants should
work their farms within range of Fritz's guns.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, July 12th.</i>&mdash;Took over from 14th Battalion
signallers at 0100 (1 a.m.) with two signallers and four orderlies.
Four hours on and eight off. I'm taking the 8 to 12 shifts day and
night, officially that is, but it seems to me that I'll have to be
on hand most of the time. There's only room for two comfortably in
this dugout. Alf's doing his turn with the ear-phones at the little
sand-bag table, and I'm lying back on the bunk. A shaded slush-lamp
and candle give a very poor light. Alf's got the shrapnel-proof
door shut and the "joint" is full of smoke. Now to ease the laces
of my boots, adjust the box-respirator in case I want it in a
hurry, and&mdash;"I say, Alf, don't forget to wake me if there's an
alarm."</p>

<p>On 8 a.m. to noon watch. Communication regular and, except for a
few shells lobbing in supports, it is very quiet. I'm told G. and a
few others are playing two-up outside. One of the orderlies, with
bayonet fixed to rifle and a piece of cheese on the tip of the
blade, has just blown a rat's head off. Don't think the battalion
has had a casualty yet. There's no mistake, it's quiet. Suppose a
raid or some other diversion will be arranged to break the
monotony. We'll soon get fed up of this Micawber stunt. It's a
cushy joint. Why, we are getting stew for dinner to-day!</p>

<p>Night shift, 11 p.m. Thought something would happen. It has. A
chap put his head up this afternoon and was killed outright. An
officer on our right is supposed to have said, "Come on, boys, let
'em know we're here;" but for everything we threw at Fritz we got
ten times as much in return. Dodging their aerial torpedoes is, I
believe, very exercising, and so is mending the phone lines when
they have done their damage. We did little else all the afternoon
other than look for and mend breaks. While pulling out a piece of
broken cable, Dab came along with a box of bombs. "You've got a
good job pulling strings," he said. "How about&mdash;" But that's
as far as he got, for we all beat it towards, instead of away from,
a shell that burst about twenty yards off. There's no mistake, we
are all windy. There was a gas alert to-night, so I don't feel a
bit like going to sleep until the wind changes. Alf's asleep and
I'm alone. Looking out of the door I imagine troops to be passing
by, but it's only the moving shadows caused by the rising and
falling flares. Fritz's flares are better than ours, and he uses
more of them. I'm beginning to like the music of the machine-guns;
they relieve the suspense. And so do the rats. I just had a crack
at one, and Alf woke up with a start. I'll have to watch Alf, as he
keeps a cartridge always ready in the breech.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, July 13th.</i>&mdash;This is the most unpleasant
job I've ever had. It's about 2.30 a.m. I don't know what awakened
me, but I got a shock to see &mdash;&mdash; on duty crying like a
kid. Poor &mdash;&mdash;, he can't help it. It's the awful
stillness before dawn. Only a few odd and distant cracks are to be
heard. This hole is dank and clammy. The slush-lamp's gone out and
the candle is giving a few last splutters. I'll light another and
see if I can't cheer him up with a game of noughts and crosses. A
drop of rum would help to chase away the dingbats. Yes, I've got
'em too, but somehow they don't show. Suppose a bloke would get
court-martialled if he played a mouth-organ and woke the major
opposite. Anyhow I can't play and I haven't got one, so that's
that. Writing this stuff is like talking to myself&mdash;think I'll
chuck it.</p>

<p>Could have counted Fritz's shells to-day, there have been so
few. The major got a shock though. He was at his dugout door
watching us clearing away a lot of old cables, when a shell
whistled over, to burst some thirty yards distant, and he swears he
saw it not more than three feet above our heads. It's a fact, too,
that if you look ahead of the direction from which you hear a heavy
shell, you can see it travelling through the air.</p>

<p>Alf and I amused ourselves by shooting about 50 rounds through a
hole in the breastwork this afternoon. Don't expect we hit anything
other than Fritz's trench, and even that was hard enough to
discern. Not a sign of a living object did we see to have a pot at.
An enemy sniper, however, saw us, when later we were looking for
souvenirs between the front and second lines. As I was filling my
water-bottle at a little creek, a bullet went clean through Alf's
on the bank, and when we stood up a couple whistled past. We are
not supposed to go out there in daylight, nor did we stay long
after that.</p>

<p>Slightly to the rear, farther along the line, are the remains of
an old convent wall. How far it is screened by our breastwork can
be seen by the line of bullet marks. A machine-gun plays on the
wall just a few feet from the water-pump, but, like most other
bullets, shells and bombs, aimed at this spot, its ammunition is
wasted.</p>

<p>It's just on midnight. I'll make up my register now and then for
some shut-eye.</p>

<p><i>Friday, July 14th.</i>&mdash;Jack F. came to see us this
morning. It rained shells just as he got here, so he stayed for an
hour until things settled down. A good deal of Flanders settled on
and round about our dugout during the bombardment. We had the door
shut and, when a burst of shrapnel hit it, Jack said: "Open the
door and pay the rent; that's the landlord." Out of that lot we
suffered a few casualties. I saw two being taken past on
stretchers. We put a new line to D.57, or at least half-way to it,
for the signallers there have to earn their tucker too. Looks as
though we'll have to run a new line to C.10 if the existing one is
not soon mended. I hope not, for I'm dead tired to-night and have
to leave here in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, July 15th.</i>&mdash;New Zealand Rifle Brigade has
just relieved us. It's early morning, and the rest of the battalion
is being relieved later. There's no doubt about these N.Z. chaps,
they treat us well everywhere. I offered to run a new line to C.10
before leaving, but their corporal won't hear of it. Instead, he
has sent two of his men to do the job, and I have just finished
some bought tucker that he brought in. Chaps of other units have
been remarking on my age. This corporal reckons I don't look more
than sixteen.</p>

<p>Later, at Battalion Headquarters.&mdash;Tom and I are in charge
of the advance party going out to Fleurbaix, about three miles
away, where we are to take up billets in the school. Coming out
from the front line, we put all our gear on a truck and I was one
of two pulling in front and going Hell-forleather along Tramway
Avenue, when&mdash;bang! The report was caused by a piece of wire
catching in the trigger of Alf's rifle on the truck. The bullet
chipped a piece off the heel of my boot and everyone laughed at the
names I called Alf. There'll be some fun in the old town of
Fleurbaix to-night, if there's an <i>estaminet</i> and I can raise
the wind.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 16th.</i>&mdash;To complete my notes of
yesterday. Arriving at Fleurbaix village, little more than a mile
behind the front line, we posted two sentries on our dump and
forthwith entered the school. Satisfaction with the billet was
being generally expressed when Fritz let us have some hate. The
first shell knocked tiles flying from the roof. The mob scattered
lively and the sentries followed them. Tom and I exchanged looks of
mutual agreement, and left the place with the excuse to our
consciences that it was our responsibility to find the boys and
keep them together. Some more of the roof came tumbling down, and
when a 5.9 went "crump" behind us we broke from our semi-dignified
walk into a wild run.</p>

<p>When free of the hamlet and having regained breath, we set out
to look for the boys. One was asleep in a hay-stack, a number were
in an old trench, and a few were taking cover under an old cart.
With much bravado we asked them why the Hell they left? They looked
very sheepish as they started to wander back. Stan H. changed from
deathly white to flaming red at my gibe&mdash;"You've got the wind
up." It hurts to be told that you are lacking in pluck and guts.
God knows, I could do with some myself.</p>

<p>Crossing the main street and walking down the path that leads to
the school, Tom and I stopped to inspect a fresh shell-hole. A
passing Tommy informed us that two engineers were killed by this
shell less than half an hour ago. We stood there discussing the
matter, when the screech of an approaching shell sent Tom running
for the cover of the corner building and I dropped flat on the
ground. I have been told that a shell never lobs in a recent
shell-hole. But this one did, with a terrific blinding crash. My
head felt that it no longer belonged to me. At first I could not
move, being paralysed with fright, but another close shell brought
me back to active life, and I hurriedly joined Tom at the corner.
He was glad to see me, saying he had felt certain that I was blown
to bits.</p>

<p>As we stood there we saw many runners and found strength of
voice to give Wal, our champion runner, a great cheer as he went
past breaking even time. "Why go to the Olympic Games?" said Tom,
"there's more speed here than I ever saw in the Goldarn
States..."</p>

<p>Towards evening the shelling quietened and we went for a look
round the village. An endless stream of army traffic kept passing
along the main street. Guns of all descriptions, limbers of
rations, wire, duckboards, sandbags, bombs, and shells, rattled and
bumped and rumbled over the rough cobbled road. The place is badly
shattered, yet civilians live within its tumbling walls,
shell-scarred halls and everlasting din.</p>

<p>A gas-alarm sounded. An aged madame came rushing out of her
dilapidated house and raved at us as though we were to blame, It
was a false alarm, however&mdash;due to a mist rising from the
ground. Tom went over to reassure the old lady, but she slammed the
door in his face. "Christ! is there no fellow feeling in this
damned place?" I was surprised to hear myself say. Tom then
remarked: "Come on, I've had enough of this joint, let's find the
mob."</p>

<p>We found them&mdash;camped against a wall&mdash;trying to take
cover from the drizzling rain.</p>

<p>"What a bloody fine billet" someone growled. "Well, go and try
your luck in the school and leave us your waterproof," Tom
suggested.</p>

<p>"Come, this is no good," Eric called to me, and I followed him
when he said he knew of a good pos-sie for two. Turning the first
corner he introduced me to the secret of his water-bottle
(S.R.D.&mdash;rum) and then produced a bottle of wine. Nelson's
blood and plonk make a good tonic, best taken when standing in the
rain before retiring to sleep in the mud. When we returned to the
garden wall, the complaints about our singing did not worry us in
the least, nor did the many questions as to the locality of our
cellar keep us awake for very long.</p>

<p>That was yesterday. To-day, things have been moving quickly. We
have received orders for a hop-over to-morrow. The whole of our 5th
Division is taking part in the stunt, also a British division on
our right. The 4th Australian Divisional Artillery has been added
to ours, and we hear that a number of 6-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers
and a 12-inch railway gun also are in readiness to lend a hand.
It's to be a big affair&mdash;I think Lille is the objective. Huge
quantities of ammunition and other material are being taken into
the line. Our guns are busy preparing the way and others are
hurriedly taking up position. But Fritz must know there's something
doing. There's much activity to be seen and aeroplanes are more
numerous than usual. So we are to have the honour of being the
first Australian troops to engage in a dinkum battle in France.</p>

<p>We have been moved nearer the line. Our billet is an old
deserted farmhouse, which seems safer than Fleurbaix. We hear Fritz
attacked the 58th Battalion last night after strafing their part of
the line with heavy artillery and trench-mortar fire. They are said
to have suffered about 150 casualties. We'll square that account
with Fritz to-morrow.</p>

<p>I'll be glad to get on the move. This waiting and keeping under
cover while a continuous bombardment is going on all round is very
trying. I have not yet received details of my duties for to-morrow
other than that I have to take a phone line over in the charge.
Most of the boys are sitting round this once-upon-a-time kitchen,
writing letters. A few are having a game of cards, and one is
looking with strange expression towards the line of bursting
shells. Though we try not to show our feelings, one cannot help but
notice the unnatural atmosphere. There's a queer hollowness in our
laughter, our jokes are a little forced, yet there's an air of
confident determination withal. How different things would be if
this place were an <i>estaminet.</i> 'Twould be Madame and her
music and the mademoiselles rather than her wine that would cheer
us up. What's the good of writing, I'll give it a go myself; "Come
on boys, a little music." "Mademoiselle from Armentires,
<i>parlez-vous!</i>"&mdash;"We Are a Rag-time Army"&mdash;"Old
Soldiers Never Die&mdash;They Simply Fade Away."</p>

<p><i>Monday, July 17th.</i>&mdash;The stunt has been postponed, or
rather the hop-over has, but the artillery of both sides is
boxing-on a treat. There's been a heavy fog; the sun is shining
now; aeroplanes are receiving much attention from Fritz, and our
front line, supports, and communication trenches are being well and
truly shelled.</p>

<p>I am sitting on some boxes of rifle ammunition at the side of
the road near the entrance to Cellar Farm Avenue. There are stacks
and stacks of ammunition all camouflaged with grass. This morning I
was sent down here with a section of signallers to help carry
60-pound plum-pudding bombs into the line for the heavy
trench-mortars. Instead, I have been having a look round. The
signallers are sheltering in the farmhouse opposite which is being
prepared for a dressing station, and is already busy handling
cases. In the graveyard alongside the farmhouse a huge grave has
just been dug for some fifty of our chaps. They are wrapped in
blankets, some of them of little more bulk than a half-filled
sandbag. Just apart from our boys lies a dead German whose tunic is
now bereft of button and badge. Two chaplains are burying our dead;
there's no "Last Post"; just the continuous roar of guns. They have
finished and are now deciding who will bury the Fritz. In the end
he's just buried, that's all, no service going with the dirt that
covers him. It seems wrong to me; he was human; he is dead; he has
loved ones who know not yet that he's gone&mdash;and how&mdash;just
chucked into a hole.</p>

<p>The noise of battle continues. One's thoughts have changed. The
glamour of war has gone; we see it as it is, a struggle for life
amidst death. I remember the cause for which we are fighting. I'll
do my bit, not with the idea of any dazzling glory, but with a
realization of the tragedy of it. Maybe I'm different from others.
I like to be alone and think, just as in those old days when I'
went cycling alone and made my bed on the sweet-smelling earth
'neath the gum-trees&mdash;but what a different bed now.</p>

<p>Have just seen two of my cobbers taken past. Lofty B. our
champion high jumper, who played the trombone in the band, has a
chunk of shell in his knee. And Rex, one of our old signallers, who
went to the 8th Machine-Gun Company, is wounded in the right arm. A
good fellow, Rex, one of the whitest. "See you in Blighty, Rex!
Cheerio" I called, and he waved his other hand. Ron C. is taking
him to the dressing station.</p>

<p>While I am writing, Fritz is shelling up the communication
trench. He's getting a bit too near for me, so I'll join the boys
over the way and share in a tin of bully-beef, which might fill the
aching void. Then for a bit of toil.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 18th.</i>&mdash;I've been for a walk to the
front line, and a run all the way back. Curiosity, they say, killed
the monkey, and it damned near did that for me. Going up Cellar
Farm Avenue, I returned via Mine Avenue, after seeing about 500
yards of the front from which we are going to hop over to-morrow.
Saw young Tozer, a signaller of the 31st Battalion, up there. I
think he's even younger than myself. His cobbers went crook because
I did not take them some rum, and would not believe that we have
not had any. The trenches are receiving much attention from Fritz's
whizz-bangs, "minnies," and 5.9s, and the troops are kept busy
rebuilding. They are all anxiously waiting for the hop-over, which
I believe has been fixed for six to-morrow night. While getting
direction from a sergeant, a 5.9 burst near by and the concussion
knocked us both over. I bled from the mouth, nose, and left ear,
but did not receive a scratch, and jumping to my feet to run I
noticed that the sergeant did not move. He was dead, concussion
apparently, for I could not see a mark. That's why I've returned
here so quickly.</p>

<p>Later. Have just received my instructions for to-morrow. I'm to
take four signallers over to Fritz's trenches, where we are to
establish a telephone station after the charge. We'll be attached
to C Company, which is to carry over supplies. Jack tells me that
my other stripe will be gazetted to-morrow. Eric W. is going over
with A Company, and Jim S. is in charge of another job. When Jack
asked me if I mind having the job I lied "No," but, now I come to
think of it, a man might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.</p>

<p>Again I feel an <i>estaminet</i> should be the place to spend
this night, but there's none that we can go to so I'll write a
letter home and then for a little sing-song.</p>

<p class="letter">MY DEAR MOTHER AND FATHER,<br>
<br>
Since last writing we have been in action, and so far I have
managed to keep away from Fritz's shells, etc. Saw Ron taking his
cobber Rex to the dressing-station yesterday with a wound in the
arm. Have received mail by <i>Osterley,</i> and one later, for
which many thanks. I am in the best of health and looking forward
to a good slap at Fritz. We will have him on the move within a day
or two, and no doubt you will read about it in the papers. Must
close now to catch the mail. Best love to all at home.<br>
<br>
Your affectionate son,<br>
TED.<br>
<br>
P.S.&mdash;Don't worry, as I am O.K. and having a good time.
Remember me to Roy and all. I'll write them later.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, July 19th.</i>&mdash;It's twelve months today
since we went into camp at Liverpool. A year in the army and still
going strong.</p>

<p>We have just dumped our packs in the Q.M.'s store, and been
issued with 48 hours' dry rations and a little phial of iodine.
Have had a good hot feed and we are now waiting to move off.</p>

<p>The shelling has considerably increased, especially since 11
a.m., the artillery "zero" hour. The lines visible from here are
just a mass of bursting shells and the air is filled with the dust
and smoke of battle.</p>

<p>Had a vivid dream last night. Dreamt that I got it in the arm,
so I've made a tourniquet in case. I'm feeling good-oh&mdash;a ball
of muscle, as Tom would say. We are all warmed up and ready, though
not from the effects of rum. That's to be given us after the
fight&mdash;it will go farther.</p>

<p>One of my signallers asked to be paraded before the doctor,
though he does not know what's wrong with himself. I told him the
doctor will soon tell him. Stan H. has offered to take his place
and Jack has agreed. Stan told Jack he would go anywhere with me.
How wonderful it is to feel that a man has such confidence in you,
it helps more than anything else to keep the wind down. It helps
too, to hum a tune to yourself. An old one's best. Mine's
"Yippi-addy, i-ay," though sometimes I miss a beat or two.</p>

<p>To be continued&mdash;later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV. FROMELLES</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Over the top&mdash;One
of the 5533 casualties.</p>

<p class="cp">(19th July 1916)</p>

<hr>

<p class="newspaper">["Suggested first by Haking as a feint-attack;
then by Plumer as part of a victorious advance; rejected by Monro
in favour of attack elsewhere; put forward again by G.H.Q. as a
'purely artillery' demonstration; ordered as a demonstration but
with an infantry operation added, according to Haking's plan and
through his emphatic advocacy; almost cancelled&mdash;through
weather and the doubts of G.H.Q.&mdash;and finally reinstated by
Haig, apparently as an urgent demonstration&mdash;such were the
changes of form through which the plans of this ill-fated operation
had successively passed. It was now definitely
ordered."&mdash;<i>Australian Official History, Vol. III,
p.350.</i>]</p>

<p>Here Ted's diary ends&mdash;a story just begun. Snapping an
elastic band over the pages, he stows and buttons the note-book
into a tunic pocket, and now, just past noon, puts on his
equipment. He pulls the belt a little tighter, slings rifle and
telephone over his shoulder, and as he lights a fag Sergeant Jack
calls: "Ted! all ready?" "All set," is the answer, and away they
go.</p>

<p>Down the shell-scarred <i>pav</i> road Ted leads his four
signallers to the lilt of "Yip-i-addy i-ay i-ay, Yip-i-addy i-ay."
Paa-aa-ang, paa-ang, whooo, paa-aa-ang! go shells of every calibre,
screeching and roaring over their heads. "&mdash;I don't care what
becomes of me."...Boom, boo-oom, crash, bang, boooom! comes the
noise in front. Bang-bang-bang! from an 18-pounder battery on the
left. "That's the stuff to give 'em!" shouts somebody. "Yip-i-addy
i-ay i&mdash;" Crrang crash! goes a 5.9 just ahead.</p>

<p>Already, walking wounded are passing back. "What's it like up
there?" they are asked. "Cushy&mdash;just got a Blighty," one
replies.</p>

<p>Paa-aa-ang, paa-ang!</p>

<p>"What! Did yer fall in the Yarra, cobber?" calls a Sydney boy to
a wet and muddy Victorian, who as he runs past is seen to be
bleeding from a gash in the neck.</p>

<p>"Yip-i-addy i-ay i&mdash;" they turn a corner to the left
"&mdash;don't care what&mdash;." A red flag waves ahead. They stop
for they have been warned of this&mdash;an 18-pounder in a
shattered building is about to fire across the road. Bang! "Christ!
look at that!" someone gasps. A rider coming from the opposite
direction has had his head blown off. "Come on! Get a move on!"
calls the guard with the red flag&mdash;then he sees too. Looking
as white as death they go quickly past the gun and its convulsing
victim! Bang! again goes the 18-pounder&mdash;perhaps now a Fritz
is dead.</p>

<p>Dazed and without being conscious of their movements, Ted and
his mates go on and turn to the 'right towards Cellar Farm Avenue,
passing the military cemetery with its field of white crosses.
Ahead, in the battle zone, huge geysers of earth are spouting
upwards as the high-explosive shells plunge into the ground and
explode, and the air above is clouded with the woolly bursts of
shrapnel. How can man live in and pass through that hell?</p>

<p>But forward they go, into the "avenue," a winding sap crowded
with life and death. Wounded are helping wounded. A man with a
shattered arm is leading out a blinded and bloody-looking figure.
Some of the wounded are laughing&mdash;others, with sagging jaws,
stare ahead. Here's a shaking, trembling, raving madman. The
signallers push on to get away from that. There are still four
hours to go to "zero." There will be no one left!</p>

<p>"Who yer with?" calls a sergeant. "C Company," they answer. "Get
along there!" and they turn left along a trench. It is the second
line&mdash;the support position. They are to wait here until the
31st and 32nd Battalions charge at 6 o'clock. From this trench
British mortars are firing 60-pound bombs; as they swear and sweat
at their work, with their tunics off, the gunners inspire
confidence. Ted walks over to get a closer view. "Come back,"
shouts a cobber, "keep to the parapet, you silly&mdash;!" But it is
too late, Ted is cracked in the hand. It is only a splinter and has
not gone right through. Someone breaks an iodine phial and splashes
the contents over the wound, and Ted tries to probe out the piece
of metal, with the broken glass. "Bad luck it's not a Blighty,"
says another, but Ted has collected his first souvenir.</p>

<p>It is now about 3.30 p.m. The barrage lifts and (bang!) cames
back. A runner tells how the boys in the front line waved their
bayonets over the top to make Fritz believe they were charging when
the barrage lifted. "To give him the office to beat it back,"
shouts someone. "Good God! there can't be any Fritzes left, they
are getting it in the neck." Not their artillery, however. Bang!
whizzz! crump! smash!</p>

<p>And so on and on through the hours. The gunfire merges into a
continuous roar above which are heard only the sharp explosions of
nearby shells. To make themselves heard in the din, men have to
shout. Now the barrage lifts again, and there is a temporary lull.
The onrushing boom of the "heavies" can be heard high above the
smaller and low screeching shells. Now it moves back on to Fritz's
front line, and almost as quickly German shells rain once more. The
boys are all hugging whatever cover they can find, tensely awaiting
their fate. Will the order to move or a shell come first? There is
nothing to do but wait. The air is rent with mighty explosions,
flying mud, bits of wood, and chunks of shells; it is filled with
smoke and dust, and filthy bitter-tasting fumes. The walking
wounded keep on passing; the stretcher cases have to wait, but
every now and then one is carried past on the back of a less
wounded cobber...</p>

<p>"How goes the time?"</p>

<p>"Forty minutes to zero."</p>

<p>Crash! a 5.9 tears through the hedge and explodes twenty yards
away. "Rotten shot," one remarks.</p>

<p>Another shell throws a ton of earth over their cover.</p>

<p>Ted remembers the O.C.'s observation at the time of a night move
in Egypt. "This is war, men," Ted shouts with an affected grin.</p>

<p>"Too bloody right," one answers.</p>

<p>"How yer feeling?" inquires Ted of an Aussie looking very
ill.</p>

<p>"Not bad&mdash;bloody fine. Got a fag? Give us a&mdash;" but a
shell crashes very close on the left and attempts at conversation
cease as they watch the victims being dragged from the scene...</p>

<p>"Prepare to move up."</p>

<p>The word is passed along.</p>

<p>It is six.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! they're over."</p>

<p>"Give it to the swine."</p>

<p>"Come on, get a move on."</p>

<p>Bang! "God! that's a mine."</p>

<p>They are ready and anxious to move. The Tommy trench-mortar men
have finished their work and are getting into their tunics as they
hurry off like a gang of navvies. "Good luck, choom," one calls, as
he passes Ted.</p>

<p>As the men of the 30th move up they pass the colonel. He looks
cool, calm, and collected, a gloved hand grasps his cane. The move
has eased the tension and the strain of waiting for the worst. Ted
trys humming "Yip-i-addy" as they go along the sap. Womp! Crash!
Ten yards ahead the trench is blown in and a human shriek is heard.
From underneath the debris two figures crawl out and one staggers
to his feet. He has lost half his head&mdash;nose, jaws and
mouth&mdash;and his bloody tongue hangs down on his chest.
Shrinking back from this awful sight so that it might pass without
touching him, Ted feels he wants to shoot him&mdash;perhaps it
would be best.</p>

<p>"Move on! Don't stand there, shake it up in front!"</p>

<p>They jump up, run along the top and regain the shelter of the
sap, such as it is, wounded, dead, and dying crowding the way.
Three hundred yards of this and they come to the front line. Here
Ted sees a cobber squatting against the breastwork, and, bending
down, he shouts out "Hello! how's things?" But the cobber does not
answer, he has "gone west"&mdash;he is dead&mdash;and his glassy
eyes do not see the troops as they come towards him from the
sap.</p>

<p>"To the right, move along!" is heard above the noise. Ted walks
behind two Aussies pushing a loaded truck along the wooden rails.
He is dazed and does not hear an approaching shell, but Stan pulls
him back in time and the truck is blown to pieces.</p>

<p>They meet Sergeant Jack. "Got all your boys?" he asks. "Harry's
gone over with the cable. Keep your sigs. together and get over
when Harry comes back." Ted's mind comes back to the job and,
seeing a major and another officer sitting in a small shelter, he
decides that it is the safest place in the line and sits with them.
But he is not long seated when a flying lump of earth knocks the
wind out of the officer, who is given a swig of whisky from the
major's ever handy flask. Ted almost wishes it was he who had
stopped the mud. A drop of whisky would be good. Why doesn't the
major give some to that crying shell-shocked case over there?</p>

<p>To the right of the front a column of white smoke rises high in
the air. "Gas!" shouts someone. "The bomb store's on fire, sir!"
reports a corporal after giving a hurried salute. "Well, go and put
it out!" advises the major, as he again removes the cork from his
flask.</p>

<p>Harry arrives. "What's it like over there?" Ted asks.</p>

<p>"Pretty crook," replies Harry. "You'll see the cable, the end's
tied near a dead Fritz. Go for the lick of your life."</p>

<p>The sergeant comes up shouting, "Hey! Haven't y' gone yet? Got
cold feet?"</p>

<p>"Cold feet yourself. Don't do your block. You haven't got a
station ready for me to send to," Ted retorts.</p>

<p>And then seeing Bert, who has been missing for some time, Ted
produces a note-book and calls, "Here you are, Bert, write your
next-of-kin's name and address."</p>

<p>There is no farewell. They grasp their rifles, and Ted slings
the phone over his shoulder. "You all set? Come on!" he calls, and
away they go. Turning right into a bay, they find it blocked by two
men who are trying to get a casualty round the corner on a
duckboard. The wounded man's leg is hanging off, but he shouts
"Good luck lads!" as they climb over the parapet.</p>

<p>God! what sights they see out there. Huddled and stretched out
bodies, khaki heaps that were once men&mdash;some of A Company
digging a trench&mdash;others, like themselves, making short
crouching runs and flinging themselves down before anything that
will afford the slightest cover.</p>

<p>"Hey! Ted!" calls a chap with his breeches blown away as he
throws himself down.</p>

<p>"Stick to it, Dab," Ted shouts back, and on they run another
twenty yards.</p>

<p>Crump! Bang! Crash! the shells fall. Zipzipzip&mdash;zipzip!
machine-gun bullets kick up the dirt around them. A lull and off,
they rush again. Zipzip! Bang! Another twisted heap of khaki hits
the ground.</p>

<p>It is Ted. He does not move. His cobbers crawl over to his side.
"Where d'you get it?" they ask him. His lips move, but they do not
hear his reply. His arm is shattered and blood is gushing from his
side. He cannot last much longer&mdash;they think he is going west.
His eyes ask them to do something. Stan rolls him on to a
ground-sheet and drags him yard by yard towards the trench. Shell
splinters tear through the sheet. The ground rocks from a nearby
shell-burst which almost covers them with mud. Stan drags him on.
Ted is in mortal dread of being hit again. At last they come to the
sally-port and he is carried on a duckboard into the trench.
"You've got the wind up," was Ted's gibe to Stan at Fleurbaix; now
Stan has risked his life to bring Ted in.</p>

<p>"Look after him, Harry," says Stan, as he grasps the phone and
faces out towards that hell again. "So long Ted, keep your pecker
up."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;luck," Ted gurgles. "Water! water!" he gasps.</p>

<p>They give him the worst possible thing. He gulps down some rum,
chokes, coughs blood, loses his breath; blood bubbles from his
side, he is in the throes of death. He quietens. They give him
water. If they can stop the bleeding he might survive. With a
bandaged lead-pencil they probe back his lung and plug the wound
with a field-dressing and pieces torn from a greatcoat. They fix a
tourniquet and bind his arm to a piece of duckboard. This completes
their rough but honest first-aid.</p>

<p>"Stretcher-bearers! Stretcher-bearers!" they call, but none
appear. A runner goes to look for them. It is getting on for ten,
and flashing shells are lighting up the darkening sky. The boys
tell Ted it is but a scratch and that he is only suffering from
shock, but he lets them know that he has no feeling below his belt.
They are not aware that four small wounds in his back have
paralysed him from the hips down&mdash;that is why he does not
feel.</p>

<p>The stretcher-bearers arrive. They are Snow and another member
of the band. All give a hand and try not to hurt him as they lift
his shattered body from the bloody duckboard to the stretcher.</p>

<p>"All set," "You're off to Blighty," "So long," "Keep up your
guts," they call to him.</p>

<p>Tears are welling into his eyes&mdash;he mutters
"S'long&mdash;thanks&mdash;g'luck."</p>

<p>It is dark. They enter the narrow sap. The 29th Battalion is
coming up. "Keep back!" Snow calls, "make way&mdash;get
over&mdash;hop across the top&mdash;this man's badly
wounded&mdash;shift over&mdash;we can't stop." And on the bearers
go grazing and tearing their hands on the sides of the sap in their
endeavour to save him from being bumped by passers-by. Womp! Crash!
The falling mud and splinters again fill Ted with fear.</p>

<p>They get him to the dugout aid-post. Has their trip been in
vain? Is he dead or alive? He is still; he's not breathing; death
is in his eyes; his lips move&mdash;"Water, water;" again he
rallies. He sees an old cobber, Hubert. The dugout is full of
wounded. Scissors and jack-knife tear his tunic open. They
re-bandage his arm and tighten the tourniquet but do not touch the
bloody khaki plug in his side.</p>

<p>The stretcher is lifted outside the dugout and placed on a pair
of wheels. After a rough ride along the shell-lit road, Ted is
transferred to a motorambulance&mdash;the engine is vibrating. "All
ready," someone shouts, and the ambulance, with four stretcher
cases and two others on the floor, rumbles along the road.</p>

<p>It is twelve hours since the rider was killed by the 18-pounder
firing across this road and much has happened since then, yet Ted's
racked brain is filled with horror at the thought of the gun firing
again. Have they passed it? Will it fire? They must be getting
near. Crash! The brakes screech. An enemy shell has burst ahead.
Had it arrived ten seconds later they would all be dead. Again the
ambulance gets going, but now and then it has to stop until Ted
gets his breath. One of the cases is raving mad, others groan with
pain, and before the field ambulance is reached one has passed
out.</p>

<p>Lying on stretchers in the open at the field ambulance are rows
and rows of men, some silent, others crying for water, and others
again craving their turn to go into the station. Ted's turn comes.
He is put on a table. The doctor thinks he should be dead, but Ted
talks and asks questions.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" he asks, as the doctor gives him an injection
in the stomach.</p>

<p>"Anti-tetanus, to prevent lock-jaw," the doctor explains. "How
old are you?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen last month," Ted answers, hoping he will not be sent
back to the front before he is eighteen. He is then given morphia
and the doctor and an orderly proceed to dress his wounds.</p>

<p>Ted is taken outside and the orderly goes to get him water. A
mist forms before his eyes and he loses the sense of feeling. The
hours of torture have ended. He drifts and thinks, and in his
semi-conscious moments his mother's face appears. He feels her kiss
and is then wafted into the unconsciousness of blessed sleep.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Of the other four original signallers of the 30th Battalion, Jim
S. was killed in this battle and Eric W. was wounded and taken
prisoner. Wal C. was wounded and invalided home soon after
Fromelles; and Tom H. went on to get his commission and lose an arm
at Villers-Bretonneux in 1918.</p>

<p>Stan H., who carried, or rather dragged, Ted in from No Man's
Land, went through the war without a scratch. After bringing Ted in
he went back and established, though not for long, the only
signalling station of the 8th Brigade in the enemy trenches that
day. In a letter to Ted's people some months later he said: "I must
tell you why I have never answered your letters. I did not want to
write at the time when you were under the impression I was a hero.
I dragged him out, that was all&mdash;it was not a brave deed. If
it has turned sorrow into happiness then I say thank God I did
it&mdash;he is not forgotten by us and never will be."</p>

<p>Later Tom H. (then O.C.) wrote: "I didn't realize how I liked
that kid until he got knocked, now I am sorry he is not with
me&mdash;he was a good signaller and a good worker. One thing is
certain, if he were with me now he would be my sergeant. Still he's
better off, this game is no place for youngsters, however willing.
He's done his bit."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV. BOULOGNE</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">A clearing
station&mdash;A hospital train&mdash;Le Casino Hospital,
Boulogne&mdash;An operation&mdash;A blood
transfusion&mdash;Tetanus&mdash;Other operations&mdash;Sisters and
visitors.</p>

<p class="cp">(20 July-2 September 1916)</p>

<p>We left Ted asleep at the field ambulance, whence he was taken
by motor ambulance to a clearing station. Here, in the early hours
of the morning, he awakened. In his semi-conscious state, he became
aware of a doctor bending over his stretcher, and of orderlies
passing to and fro with enamel mugs and bottles in a' bare
barn-like building; he could hear groans, moans, screams, and
laughter; saw a blanket being pulled over the head of the chap on
the next stretcher; felt a prick in the arm and found himself
slipping away; marching, singing, trying to yell, seeing his
companion of the march with half a head; seeing it all again. But
where was he? No&mdash;not there, he could not hear the guns; but,
instead, "Water, water," "Shut yer mouth," "Let a bloke sleep,"
moans, groans, and laughter; and going off again.</p>

<p>It is daylight. He is being carried on his stretcher. He cannot
move. His left knee is still resting on his chest, the sinews
having contracted when he was knocked. As the leg cannot be pulled
down to allow of his being placed in a bunk in the hospital train,
his stretcher&mdash;Snow's stretcher&mdash;is put on the floor. The
train starts. A sister in a white cap&mdash;the first British woman
he had seen for years, no only eight months&mdash;kneels beside
him; he sees her quite close, then she fades away, but no, she is
still with him: cutting his muddy bloody uniform away, washing his
face, putting his letters and diary into a peggy bag. She asks his
name, his age, and says: "Come, my dear, a little drink." She
wishes they might be going to Blighty together, he is going to have
such a wonderful time over there. She gives him some chocolate. The
doctor comes, they adjust some bandages and stop a blood leak. The
train goes on. He must not try to talk. He goes to sleep&mdash;he
wakes and tries to call out, blood gushes from his mouth, he vomits
the blood swallowed in his sleep, the sister comes, he chokes,
loses his breath, they give him oxygen. He revives, the sister
washes him again, she holds his hand and stays with him until the
train reaches Boulogne. She goes with the orderlies who carry him
to the platform, then stoops over, kisses him, and is gone. He sees
his mother, he wants to live&mdash;he will live.</p>

<p>It is afternoon. The ambulance arrives at No. 13 General
Hospital (Le Casino) aned is placed in Ward 3C (Le Salon du
Baccava), an oval room with decorated walls and ceiling and large
windows looking out over the English Channel. An immediate
operation is ordered. He passes through spacious halls to the
theatre; a mask blots out the bright dazzling light; a few breaths
of anaesthetic; he is wafted through miles and miles of beautiful
marble halls; all the horror has gone; no longer is he fighting for
life; the staircases and halls are leading to Heaven; how quiet and
how peaceful! Now he is coming back, at first gently hovering,
sinking a little, hovering again, falling through clouds and space,
floating a little, falling, feeling pain, wanting to call out,
going off, coming back, trying to move, he feels the pain.
Something is gripping his wrist like a vice, now but a gentle
touch. A nurse is taking his pulse. He opens his eyes, tries to
smile, sinks back again; the pain, a prick in the arm, a drink from
the spout of a feeder. He is feeling better but must not talk. He
cannot move a limb&mdash;can only breathe and sleep.</p>

<p>The full extent of Ted's injuries has been revealed under the
anaesthetic: g.s.w. (gunshot wounds) in left chest, consisting of a
small hole just below the neck and a large cavity four inches in
diameter on the left side (caused by a machine-gun), as a result of
which the lung has been shattered and the small piece left is
totally collapsed, while his heart has moved and can be seen
through the hole. The right arm is smashed through the elbow
(another machine-gun bullet), and a small piece of shrapnel lies
embedded in the back of the hand; in his back are four small
shrapnel wounds (one having partially paralysed the spine&mdash;the
lower organs of the body function unknowingly). In addition there
are two old, open wounds on the side of his right foot (legacies
from Egypt). He cannot move his left arm, which lays twisted and
contracted on his chest. The left leg has been tied down. He is
helpless.</p>

<p>The operation was performed in order to clean him up. His right
arm is stretched out on an iron extension splint; bits of smashed
ribs, dead lung and flesh have been removed from his body; a blood
transfusion has been given, and now he is sleeping in the Casino's
Salon du Baccava&mdash;built for the pleasures of the rich, but now
filled with the wrecks of human folly.</p>

<p>The following day Ted contracted tetanus and for ten days
suffered racking pain: spasms shooting from the toes through the
body and bending it back and back so that head almost touched his
feet; throat cords taut and stretched from chin on to chest; the
jaws locked fast and mouth contracted into a grin. He was given
countless injections of serum, and as many anaesthetics as his
shattered chest would permit, and he had to be forcibly fed. Thus
he survived the attack of tetanus, which is so often fatal, and
results in the worst death of all.</p>

<p>Operations followed almost daily. On one occasion four inches of
rib were removed without an anaesthetic, as Ted's chest condition
was too bad to permit of its being administered. Dressings were
painful, but not so the chest wound, except when twice each day he
was turned on his side so that the cavity could be emptied of pus,
which sometimes amounted to as much as a kidney dish full. Although
he had to be fed, he enjoyed his food, especially cabbage. Sister
D. bet him half a franc he could not suck a raw egg. He did so, and
kept the coin as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Sometimes Ted was the only patient in the ward, but not for
long. A draft would no sooner be evacuated to Blighty than another
battle would send a proportion of its wounded to fill the hospital
again.</p>

<p>French visitors came round with cigarettes and sweets. They were
mostly old folk and looked very sad. Ted liked best to talk with
the sisters when they could spare him a little time. They talked
mostly of the future&mdash;after the war and not of it. The
R.A.M.C. chap who gave his blood for the transfusion came to see
Ted before going "out there;" he was killed a few weeks later.</p>

<p>Sometimes the chaplain was sent for to say a few last words. Ted
agreed with all he said, but did not understand he was supposed to
be dying. "Thanks Dad, see you to-morrow," he whispered on one of
these occasions. The chaplain on his future visits which became
regular, read the boy the war news instead of the prayer-book.</p>

<p>Ted got on well with all but one orderly, who, because the
patient cried out for attention one night, came and roughly put a
dirty hand over his mouth. This worried Ted all the next day, but,
instead of reporting the incident, he waited until the orderly came
on duty again and then, with as much strength as he could put into
his voice called out: "You dirty German bastard! You're worse than
the one who shot me. I'll come back and kill&mdash;," but he got no
further. The other patients cheered, the sister came in and the
orderly went&mdash;for good.</p>

<p>Ted was in this hospital for 45 days and the conduct of that
orderly formed his only complaint. Thanks to the wonderful
treatment, an air-filled mattress, and healthy flesh, his back
wounds healed. The paralysis gradually lessened, but with the
return of feeling he suffered continual pain. Able to move only the
fingers of his left hand, he still had to be fed. Once, when under
the influence of morphia, he sang "The Soldier's Farewell to Egypt"
and sometimes, when coming out of the anaesthetic, he gave his
fellow-patients some entertainment, but generally he was much too
ill to whisper, let alone talk and sing. One day almost dead, the
next would find him trying to sing; later he would go down again,
only to come up for more on the morrow.</p>

<p>His diary was in great demand, but Sister D. would not allow it
to be taken out of her care. On 2 September 1916, she entered in
it: "Little Corporal Rowland going to England to-day. We all wish
him the best of luck, he's been such a good patient."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI. BLIGHTY</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">A Channel
crossing&mdash;A Dover welcome&mdash;Fort Pitt&mdash;The first
night&mdash;Mrs B.&mdash;Some friends and two sky
pilots&mdash;Visits from Major H.</p>

<p class="cp">(3 September-12 October 1916).</p>

<hr>

<p>Ted did not want to leave Boulogne and all the good friends he
had made, but they told him he would receive much better treatment
and have a far better time in Blighty, and they treated him to
champagne on the eve of his departure.</p>

<p>Dressed in a Tommy uniform to which was attached a special
label, and with a letter from his present doctor to the M.O. in
Blighty in his pocket, he was put on a special air bed-stretcher
ready for transport. The stretcher-bearers came. "Ready&mdash;lift"
followed by "Good-bye," "Cheerio Aussie," "Thanks Sister," "So long
Tommy," "Good luck, Choom," and he was on the way. Another parting
over&mdash;another stage begun.</p>

<p>A short ambulance ride, the familiar vibration over the cobble
<i>pav,</i> no waiting at the wharf, immediate embarkation,
inspection of label at the top of the gangway, an order, taken down
a companionway on a slanting stretcher, met by a sister, and his
air-stretcher placed on top of a cot. "You all right?" Temperature
taken. "Yes. Orderly! A drink of milk for this man" and she passes
on to the next.</p>

<p>The vessel is moving. Formerly a Belgian mail liner, she is now
a well-fitted hospital ship. She begins to roll, the sister comes
round looking ill, and does not come again. The ship goes on
through the night and many are seasick. Ted in his weak state
wonders whether they will stop a torpedo or a mine. Would they
carry him up on deck or could he walk up if placed on his feet?
Would the stretcher float, and if he fell off would the port-hole
in his chest fill with water? He thinks he might float for a little
while, and pictures a bottle bobbing up and down in the water; as
it sinks he feels himself suddenly fall out of bed&mdash;and
awakens from his stupor in a cold sweat. The orderly refills the
hot-water bottle and holds the spout of a feeder to his lips;
that's good, it's got a kick in it. The orderly winks, a good
fellow that. And Ted, thinking of other good fellows, falls
asleep.</p>

<p>"Blighty" "Dover" "Home, choom." It is early morning. They see
the white cliffs through the portholes. Good. There is no delay.
The stretchers are placed in rows on the quayside station awaiting
the hospital train. English folk come round with cigarettes and
sweets. It is drizzling rain. A lady holds an umbrella over Ted,
while another lights a cigarette between her own lips and gives it
to him. She asks where he was wounded.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in France" he tells her.</p>

<p>But she wants to know about his wounds.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a bit in the arm and chest, nothing much."</p>

<p>"Why can't you use your other arm?"</p>

<p>"Housemaid's knee in the elbow through leaning on
<i>estaminet</i> counters."</p>

<p>She laughs. Where does he live? "Australia." He doesn't look
like an Australian. Does he know a Mr Adams in Adelaide? No, he
lives in Sydney and only visits Adelaide for week-ends, but he'll
look him up.</p>

<p>"Don't worry him," says Mrs Umbrella, "he looks tired."</p>

<p>He is, too, and his respirations have doubled. The cigarette and
talking have had an even worse effect than the cigar and excitement
of the day leaving Sydney. He vomits: an orderly comes and shakes
the blanket and then turns it up the other way. Ted apologizes. The
ladies hope they have not upset him. Oh, no, just
seasickness&mdash;that's all&mdash;delayed action, always affects
him that way. Miss Cigarette tucks a hanky under his chin as the
train arrives.</p>

<p>"Mr Adams, Adelaide."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>"Thank you, cheerio."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>So this is Blighty. Ted says he is to be left on the stretcher,
but they bring a doctor who orders him to be put in a cot. The
sister says it's a shame. The move hurts him, and the splint drops
on the bed. He yells, "Go easy," and, when the sister goes to get
him something, he calls one of the orderlies an awkward
b&mdash;&mdash;. On the journey his back aches, and by the time the
train reaches Chatham he has got a bed sore. Blast Blighty. Why did
he leave France? Why did he leave home?</p>

<p>They come to lift him on to a stretcher. "Now, go easy."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, choom."</p>

<p>"Who's afraid? Who's a choom?"</p>

<p>"Steady&mdash;lift."</p>

<p>"Good, thanks, CHOOM!"</p>

<p>The ambulance ride to Fort Pitt Military Hospital is the last
straw, Ted being only semi-conscious on arrival. Undressed on the
bed by two orderlies, he suffers much pain as they try to get the
tunic off, and forgets about the letter in his pocket for the M.O.
A sister comes, takes his temperature and pulse, and tells an
orderly to bring a four-hourly chart. She and another sister dress
his arm, and for the first time he sees four inches of jagged bone
sticking through the flesh. The doctor orders morphia, and Ted
sleeps, but not for long.</p>

<p>All that night he raves and lives the last twelve months over
again. The vision of the chap with half his head blown away is
everywhere&mdash;on the troopship, in Cairo, in the
<i>estaminet,</i> in the next bed, as the orderly. He sees it all
again. He hears Crrang! tut-tut-tut, boom! and awakens.</p>

<p>"Good morning!"</p>

<p>The sister has placed a paper-shaded hurricane lamp on the
locker and a bowl of water on the bed-table, so this is what he
heard. But good morning? It is still dark. With the assistance of
an orderly, she pulls the bed clothes from underneath the top
blanket, to find one side of the sheet wet with pus. The sister
looks. Yes, he has a wound in the chest. When are they going to
empty it? The orderly fetches a doctor and they receive a shock
when the dressing is taken down. Why has he not told them of this?
Ted suddenly remembering the letter, the orderly is sent to find it
and to inform another doctor, who comes in a dressing-gown. The
patient asks to be turned on his side so that the cavity may empty,
but they won't hear of it; he must not be moved. A rubber tube is
brought and the pus syphoned off before the orderly returns with
the letter.</p>

<p>By this time most of the patients have been wakened, and there's
a rattle of mugs as an orderly comes round with coffee. Ted calls,
"Hey! What about me?" Yes, he can have some. "Get him a
feeder."</p>

<p>The doctors ask a lot of questions. "Yes" "No," "Yes" "Don't
know" "Seventeen" "19th July" "Sydney."</p>

<p>"Would you like anything, lad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please, beer."</p>

<p>"You shall have it. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"A wash."</p>

<p>"Right-oh! I'll give you a five-pound note when you are
better."</p>

<p>From the next bed comes an Aussie voice: "That's right, put the
wind up the poor cow, you b&mdash;&mdash; goat."</p>

<p>The doctors leave and the washing is proceeded with.</p>

<p>A few days pass. The ward is very comfortable. There are steam
radiators along the walls and shaded reading lights over the beds.
The floor is highly polished and everything is spotlessly clean,
for this is one of the surgical wards of a regular military
hospital. Mac, the only other Australian in the ward, in the next
bed to Ted, has a badly smashed arm, but what worries him most is
Ted's welfare, and he takes it upon himself to keep order. He
insists that Ted must not be wakened for morning washes; but
himself sometimes wakes the boy up when abusing others for
laughing, talking, and groaning during the early morning treatment.
A red shaded light worried Ted at night, so Mac put it out with a
well-aimed bottle and was threatened with being sent to another
hospital.</p>

<p>The doctor dresses Ted's chest wounds, mopping out the cavity
with gauze pads on large forceps. This does not hurt, in fact it
tickles his back ribs on the inside and makes him laugh. He does
not learn until later that one slip on the doctor's part and the
forceps might touch his heart. A torch is kept on the locker so
that interested visiting doctors may have a look at Ted's works;
the youngster hears much of their talk&mdash;"The pericardium, yes,
quite distinct, it has moved, yes, to the right and a little higher
up, the shock, the explosion..." Anyhow, it keeps on beating and,
as Ted once said, "The open-air life agrees with it." He tells one
of them that he can account for it being a little higher up,
because it jumped into his mouth when he got cracked. One day he
asked for a mirror to be held near the hole, and when he saw his
heart he remarked that it looked like a piece of meat. Maybe he
expected it to be of gold. At one time there was some talk of
putting a silver plate in his side, so he asked that it be engraved
with the date and name of the battle, but the idea was later
abandoned.</p>

<p>On Mac's advice Ted complained about being disturbed so much,
and so in future, while the doctor attended to his chest, a sister
would dress his arm and bed sore and fix up any other matters that
needed attention. This was a much better arrangement. At eleven
o'clock a V.A. would feed him with a bottle of beer.</p>

<p>In the hospital were a few other Australians, including Rex F.,
who had also been wounded at Fromelles and passed Ted near Cellar
Farm. He was still having a bad time with his arm, but in between
operations he came to sit with Ted and feed him with chocolate
covered biscuits and other dainties from the canteen. Ted was
generally too ill to speak, but his cobber would nevertheless sit
by him, when he might have been enjoying a concert or some other
form of recreation. Occasionally, however, they conversed and
laughed over old times, yet did not say much about the war. At
intervals they even talked of the future, although Rex never for a
moment thought there could be one for Ted, nor, in fact, did anyone
there hold out any hope of his survival.</p>

<p>The short talks and long hours of silent company and mutual
sufferings shared by these two fellow-sufferers laid the foundation
of a friendship much greater than most folk ever know. Came a time
when there was a long interval between visits. Ted wondered what
was wrong and, when he learnt that Rex was going through a close
battle with death, he asked to be taken on his bed to see him.
Fortunately this was Rex's last operation, and he pulled through,
although it was some time ere he was again able to renew his visits
to Ted.</p>

<p>Mrs O.E.H.B., an Australian whose surgeon husband was serving
with the British Navy, was the Australian Red Cross representative
at this hospital. More than anyone else she held out hope for Ted's
recovery, and gave him the strength and will to live through the
months that followed. For hours each day she would sit with and
comfort him according to his mood; reading to him, writing his
letters, talking of his home-coming and his future, what others had
done and were doing to overcome their disabilities. In fact, she
took him right away from the present and set his mind along the
highway of desire and pleasant anticipation. She gave him the
incentive to strive, painting many pretty word pictures of his
mother, his home, the sunshine, the Australian bush, its birds and
flowers. Her quiet sympathy, her happy talks, her cheerfulness and
understanding, her attention to his every want expressed and
otherwise, made him live, and he looked forward to her daily
visits. She made him pyjama coats that could be put on without
moving him unduly, and small down pillows that relieved and
comforted the aching parts. There were times when he was very ill,
and others when he abandoned all hope. It was then that her gentle
touch, her kiss, her whispered "Bill" did what medicine and medical
skill could never do. They brought him back&mdash;and with
confidence she would leave him in the care of her strength and
love, sleeping until the morrow. As Ruskin says of women in "War":
"Such absolute helpmates you are that no man can stand without that
help, nor labour in his own strength."</p>

<p>Many other friends&mdash;doctors, sisters, V.A. nurses,
wardsmaids, orderlies, and convalescent patients&mdash;gave
untiring service, sympathetic treatment, and cheer. Their kindly
words of encouragement, their jocular remarks, their little acts of
kindness smoothed the roughness of the way and helped to clean and
heal the wounds of the mind for which there are no lotions other
than love and understanding. Some of the good souls who helped to
pull him through, Ted never met. From one or other of them came
fresh cream daily by post from Devonshire, oysters from Whitstable,
champagne, turtle soup, cases of stout, fruit, and other nourishing
luxuries; and once there arrived a box of grapes as big as plums
with a card inscribed: "To Cpl Rowland from Her Majesty the
Queen."</p>

<p>A locker on each side of the bed, a well stocked "cellar"
underneath, and a railing on either side to prevent any chance
movement that might cause pain, upset the regimental orderliness of
the ward, but this was overlooked in the general process of
spoiling him in every conceivable way.</p>

<p>A parson with a long face (a conscientious objector) who came
round the ward with a prayer-book in one hand and a bunch of grapes
in the other was much disliked. He did not visit all the patients
but only those of his own denomination who happened to be on the
D.I. (dangerously ill) list. The first and last time he came to see
Ted, he woke him up to ask:</p>

<p>"Do you know the Lord?"</p>

<p>"Yes" answers Ted. "I was enjoying His blessing of sleep."</p>

<p>"Awaken unto the Lord." (He thereupon plucked two grapes from
the bunch and placed them on the locker.) "Come, pray with me for
forgiveness."</p>

<p>"What for?" says Ted.</p>

<p>"The scripture sayeth, thou shalt not kill."</p>

<p>"And I say I'd like to kill you, you miserable swine. Go!"</p>

<p>He did, taking with him his peace offering of two grapes.</p>

<p>The R.C. chaplain was a good old sport. Known as "Peppermint
Jim" always smiling, he would go from bed to bed, dip his podgy
hand into a bag, extract a peppermint and place it into the open
mouth of the patient, sister, or visitor. He did not assume an air
of superiority, but radiated and inspired good fellowship as man to
man. His happy countenance caused many to seek his comfort, not for
assistance over the divide, but for help to live.</p>

<p>"Hello, my boy! You look well to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm not one of your boys."</p>

<p>"You are all my boys. You smile. You like my peppermints. You
like to see me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad."</p>

<p>"Keep smiling. God bless you. Yes, I'll come again."</p>

<p>Major H., formerly second-in-command of the 30th Battalion but
now C.O. of the 54th, came to see Ted. He had probably forgotten
the little incident at the Showground Camp when he let the boy off
with a caution. Anyway he did not mention it. They had a long talk
about the old battalion, and (from their respective points of view)
some of the amusing episodes connected with it, and had just
started on a bag of chocolates when the sister advised Ted that he
had had enough excitement for one day. The major called again
before returning to France, but left, with the conviction that he
had seen the last of Ted, who at this time was occupying the corner
bed, it being the most convenient to the morgue. As usual, however,
Ted derived much good from the visit, and enjoyed particularly the
conversation of two Tommy patients opposite who thought that the
needle, given him after the major's departure, had put Ted to
sleep.</p>

<p>"D'you see t'orfficer coom t' see Bill?" said one. "Not 'arf,"
replied the other. "A bleedin' craarn 'n' all. Dyer 'ear 'em
larfin'?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Bill's well in wi' t' 'eads, is Bill."</p>

<p>"'E is 'n' all. 'Is farver owns the Yarra Bank or
somefink&mdash;I 'e'rd 'im tellin' a ole tart t'other day abart
it."</p>

<p>"That's nowt to t' lad nar, choom."</p>

<p>"All 'is parnds and craarns carn 'elp 'im, 'e'll soon be gorn
nar."</p>

<p>"Ay, poor lad, 'e's gime orlright, choom."</p>

<p>"Not arf, 'e ain't. Struf! Fancy larfin'."</p>

<p>And then, to relieve their awe, Ted (drunk with morphia)
sang:</p>

<p class="poem">We are a ragtime army,<br>
The A-N-Z-A-C!<br>
We cannot shoot, we won't salute;<br>
What bally use are we?<br>
And when we get to Berlin<br>
, The Kaiser he will say:<br>
Hoch, hoch, mein Gott,<br>
What a bloody rotten lot,<br>
Are the A-N-Z-A-C!</p>

<p>One day, the King's surgeon, Sir Frederick came to see Ted and
gave orders for the treatment he desired the boy to receive prior
to his performing on him an "Eslanders" operation. This would be
the most extensive chest operation yet performed in the hospital.
When Sir Frederick had gone, Mac remarked to Ted: "You're lucky,
that's King George's doc. He operated on King Ted for appendicitis
and on the Kaiser's throat&mdash;pity he didn't chop his bloody
head off." And so Ted was moved out on to the veranda to be
fattened up and got ready for the operation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII. TOUCH AND GO</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">A bottle of
ribs&mdash;A future mother-in-law&mdash;Smile, damn you,
smile&mdash;Two parties.</p>

<p class="cp">(13 October 1916-5 February 1917)</p>

<hr>

<p>Had Ted been superstitious, he would probably have objected to
the "hop-over" being staged on Friday, 13 October, but the only
thing that worried him was having to go without breakfast that
morning. In the end he got into trouble for eating a quarter-pound
of chocolate and a banana just before zero hour (8 a.m.).</p>

<p>Waiting to undergo an operation is like waiting to go over the
top. The preparation and empty stomach did not help to make matters
better, and it was a relief when the trolly came and the farewells
were taken.</p>

<p>"Hope you like the pictures, Aussie."</p>

<p>"Good luck, Bill."</p>

<p>"He'll give us some fun coming out of the dope."</p>

<p>"Not 'arf."</p>

<p>"Sing us 'Mrs Brown's Daughter' when you come back."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Can I 'av' yer beer, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So long. Here we go, Mum; Dad's driving."</p>

<p>A brief silence and the trolley arrived at the theatre.</p>

<p>"How are you, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Good-oh!"</p>

<p>"What! Do you feel cold?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, just got the delicious trembles."</p>

<p>"Got any false teeth?"</p>

<p>"No, why? What's the big idea? I've already had three of
those."</p>

<p>"It's all right, Bill, it's another way of giving an
anaesthetic, that's all. You'll be asleep soon."</p>

<p>Going&mdash;going&mdash;"Don't forget to save the
bones"&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;"So l-ong"&mdash;gone.</p>

<p>It was a lengthy operation. The left wall of the chest was
incised and drawn back, portions of six ribs being removed. The
skin that had grown over the small piece of lung (totally collapsed
these three months) was dissected, and the piece of lung treated
and inflated until it resumed its function of breathing. Rubber
tubes were inserted here and there, the chest wall was brought back
and sewn up, and the surgeon's work was complete. He and his
assistants however, had more than one anxious moment before the
patient regained consciousness, about midnight.</p>

<p>Ted was at first conscious of sound, then of light and pain, and
later still of four stands round the bed supporting containers from
which rubber tubes ran to various parts of his body. Two of these
irrigated the chest and right arm respectively, while a third
injected glycerine to remove the anaesthetic. The outlets of these
emptied into a tub beneath the bed. The fourth tube had no outlet,
its function being to run saline into his almost bloodless veins.
"You'd think a man was a blanky Murrumbidgee irrigation farm," he
said some days later.</p>

<p>Weeks went by. Mere words cannot tell what Ted endured, nor, for
that matter, can they adequately express the suffering of those who
nursed and watched and waited over him day and night. Some weeks
after the operation the sister in charge of the ward wrote to his
mother: "...he has had a very serious operation. He has been so
brave and tried very hard to get well, but in spite of it all a few
days ago I really thought he would go under. However, the last two
days he has seemed a little stronger and the pain has not been
quite so acute."</p>

<p>A bottle of ribs in spirit now adorned the top of Ted's locker.
The Yorkshire boy in the next bed who had had both legs amputated
complained of the pain in his toes, yet he laughed until he was ill
when Ted said: "That's nothing to the pain I have when the nurse
dusts my bottle of ribs."</p>

<p>Ted said he was feeling better, but he was moved into a little
room at the end of the ward. This place was really too quiet and
too suggestive of the morgue&mdash;the boys called it the "Dying
Room." But it was not always quiet, and to this day is probably
haunted by the yells of pain as well as the ghosts of those who
went west within its walls. It was here that Ted first met Mrs C.,
who, in response to a cable from one of Ted's cousins in Australia,
actually came to the hospital to make arrangements for Ted's
burial. Quite generously though pessimistically she loaned him a
pound, and promised to come again. She did; and Ted, hearing
something of her small daughter (R.) who had been rescued from a
Belgian town within a few hours of its being occupied by the
Germans, asked that she be brought to see him.</p>

<p>Sometime towards the end of January 1917, Mrs C. brought R. to
see him. Ere this the chest wounds had healed and he had regained
some movement in his left hand and elbow. A ward concert did not
permit of their talking very much, but R.'s squeezing hand, as it
registered the beats of "Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-bag"
"We've Come Up from Somerset," and "Back Home in Tennessee" to the
accompaniment of the music and singing, conveyed something else to
Ted and impressed upon his mind the picture of her sweet youth and
cheerful loveliness. Her laughing eyes and rosy cheeks, crowned
with tam-o'-shanter of green, he likened unto a blushing rosebud
sparkling with dew in the early sunlight of a new-born day. Yes,
life was good, he had much to live for. But it was another five
years and more ere Mrs C. again brought her rosebud to Ted, and it
is now thirteen years since they married.</p>

<p>But to return to Fort Pitt in November 1916. We find Ted, though
still seriously ill, sufficiently well to send his greetings home
in the form of a pencil sketch.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src="1600501h-images/image-17a.jpg">
</p>

<p>This effort took him half a day, for it had to be done with his
left hand, which was not then even recovered sufficiently to enable
him to feed himself.</p>

<p>During December Ted received some money from home and shouted
the forty patients in the ward to pork sausages and tomatoes. As
the wardsmaid, Molly, cooked each batch in the little frying pan,
they were given out, and just when the last patient was being
served the first commenced being sick. With the exception of Ted
and a few others all were violently ill, and Ted was most unpopular
with the night sister who was kept going all the time. Molly, by
the way, <i>was</i> a good sport. At the hospital there was a "wet"
canteen for the staff, and she "ran the rabbit" for the boys.</p>

<p>On Friday 19 January (Friday must have been his lucky day),
exactly six months from the date he was wounded, Ted asked to be
lifted out of bed. They stood him on his feet and&mdash;with right
arm hanging in a splint, left arm in a sling, body bent, and two
stiff legs&mdash;he walked. This feat was so much beyond their
expectation that he had to perform in front of the matron and the
chief M.O., and then he retired to the little room, where a Scotty,
minus half his face, and J.B.W., a Tommy with both legs
spread-eagled on splints, had a party waiting for him. Scotty had
kept his Halloween pumpkin-cake for the occasion, and J.B.W. had
saved up a lot of ginger ale bottles which now, thanks to Molly,
were filled with beer and hidden between his legs underneath the
counterpane.</p>

<p>The trio had their party and a song. Scotty taught Ted to drink
out of a glass placed on the mantelpiece, and all went well until
Ted's legs began to wobble to the strains of "On the Mississippi."
He tried to push himself through the swing doors but only succeeded
in getting his head through, when the doctor came along the
passage. Ted's eyes told the tale.</p>

<p>"It's you, Bill. The first day out of bed. After all we have
done for you, and you get drunk."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Doc., can't 'elp b-b-blood
trans&mdash;trans&mdash;fusion (hic). 'E must of b-been a (hic)
b-b-boozer. Never t-tochd it mashelf (hic)&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you're making up for it now. Come on, you tough young
scoundrel," and laughing, the doctor carried him off to bed.</p>

<p>Ted was a bit off-colour the next day, but two nights later he
walked through the snow and some hours after the same doctor
discovered him having supper with a night sister in front of a
fire. Again he was carried back to bed, his laughter when the
doctor spanked him waking up all the other patients in the
ward.</p>

<p>Another day he was found in the operating theatre, with the
orderlies displaying the various instruments used on his case and
explaining the several phases of the operation. He tried to
souvenir the pair of rib-cutting shears, which have a straight and
a curved blade, but he was caught in the act of trying to
manipulate it into his sling.</p>

<p>One day an Australian surgeon came to see him. The visitor
turned out to be none other than the famous Colonel Ryan, who was
reputed for his hardness in sending the boys back to the line.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, so you are only seventeen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"There is a hospital ship going to Australia soon. Would you
like to go home or remain in England for a year or two?"</p>

<p>"How about my arm?"</p>

<p>"You will get just as good treatment out there. Do you feel fit
for the trip?"</p>

<p>"Too right. Home sweet home will do me, sir. I'll come back and
have a look at Blighty some other day."</p>

<p>"Very well, my boy, but don't get excited, you must take every
care of yourself," and as he left he scruffed Ted's hair.</p>

<p>Ted thought he was breaking the news to Mrs B. but she knew even
more about the arrangement, and when she said "Yes, I have been
speaking with Colonel Ryan," Ted could not at first believe that
the kindly chap who had been talking with him was the famous
"Gutter King."</p>

<p>Chook F. (one of the signallers Ted introduced to the battalion
from Zeitoun) came to visit Ted. He had been wounded in the foot
but was sent back to France, got an issue of gas, and died at
Melbourne on the way home. Harry B. also visited the hospital when
he came across on leave from France. He too was subsequently
invalided home, and some fifteen years later he wrote to
congratulate Ted on having survived his 53rd operation: "...you
cannot blame people if they regard you as a 'bit of a curio' (to
use your own words). Had I not known you I would never have
believed any human being could have gone through so much and
lived...I vividly recall my visit to you&mdash;and the bottle
containing your ribs&mdash;what souvenirs!"</p>

<p>On Sunday, 4 February, Mrs B. took Mac and Ted to her home at
the naval dockyard. They had a most enjoyable time and were put at
ease in their difficulty of trying to do the right thing at the
bounteous table. Having for so long been cut off from such
refinement made it bad enough, but&mdash;each being handicapped
with the loss of an arm, and in Ted's case, the partial loss of the
other as well&mdash;it might indeed have been most embarrassing had
not Mrs B. exercised much kindly consideration in her preparations
for the event. Yes, it was an event, for that matter the only
homelike experience Ted had during his eighteen months abroad,
unless his supper with Yvonne be permitted to come under that
heading. Some jolly songs were sung, and a visiting naval officer,
because he was in the home of a fleet surgeon where two "war
scarred heroes" were being entertained; thought it fitting to
sing:</p>

<p class="poem">I've got the hooperzootic and I don't know where it
is,<br>
It may be in my finger, it may be in my thumb,<br>
It may be in the corner of my pericardium, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Driving back to the hospital with Mrs B., Ted felt he was
leaving much behind and all that night and the next day he suffered
again the pain and joy of "going away." He was going home&mdash;he
dreamed that he was there, sitting on the wood-box in the kitchen
watching Mother cook. The dream faded, he was leaving home,
marching to the music of the band, in Egypt, in France, in
hospital, and now&mdash;he was going home, going away; and
something of his innermost feelings must have escaped that old
parting grin when he said "Good-bye." Good-bye to Fort Pitt, its
garrison of loving hearts, its Great Heart Mrs B. Good-bye to all
its suffering&mdash;no, that's already gone&mdash;but not good-bye
to all its happy times, which will remain a living memory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII. TROOPS IN
TRANSIT</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">An ambulance
ride&mdash;Muscles at Harefield&mdash;A brief leave&mdash;The last
letter home.</p>

<p class="cp">(6th February-20th February 1917).</p>

<hr>

<p>About 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 6 February, an Australian
motor-ambulance arrived at Fort Pitt to collect three cot cases and
a sitting patient for transfer to Harefield Hospital. No provision
having been made to close in the back of the vehicle, it was
therefore hardly suitable for a long journey in the middle of the
coldest English winter for twenty years.</p>

<p>According to the instructions received by the driver, Ted was to
be the sitting patient, on the floor of the truck, with one
stretcher case overhead and two alongside. Fort Pitt would not hear
of such treatment. Orderlies, wardsmaids, V.As, sisters, and two
doctors, gathered for the send off, insisted that this was
impossible. Here was a military problem of the first magnitude. The
driver had signed for his freight; the patients were no longer on
the strength of Fort Pitt; it was the receiving hospital's
responsibility to supply "crates and packing;" the said receiving
authorities did not consider that an arm-and-chest case now
eighteen days able to walk after six months in bed warranted a
stretcher; the forwarding hospital considered that it did; there
was no provision in the King's Regulations for lending a stretcher;
something had to be done; but what? An orderly had a brain wave.
"Give him one of ours;" but the Q.M. would not hear of it. A sister
said something to a doctor; the doctor whispered to the driver; the
sister whispered to an orderly; the orderly went away; the
ambulance moved round the corner. The farewell party, now somewhat
diminished, followed the ambulance, and after another little wait,
the orderly came creeping round the corner with a stretcher. "Ha
ha! all is not lost" said Ted. "Sh-h," from the doctor, "come on;"
and, as they eased him down, Ted said "Thanks Doc., thanks Sister,
thanks Alf., where did you pinch it?"</p>

<p>All this to-do about nothing had the effect of hastening the
much delayed departure. The stretcher was no sooner run into place
than off. "Good luck" "Good&mdash;," a wave or two&mdash;finish.
Something like a departure, thought Ted, as the ambulance rattled
through the gate.</p>

<p>This little episode was Ted's first experience of bad management
since Fromelles&mdash;unfortunately, it was not to be the last. The
driver lost his way. To the patients, whose view for mile upon mile
was restricted to a glimpse of the retreating snow-covered
landscape through the open back of the ambulance, the trip was
uninteresting. Now and again they stopped a snow-ball or a few
cheers from some children, and sometime after noon they pulled up
at an inn.</p>

<p>"What's this, the hospital?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the driver. "The Dew Drop Inn."</p>

<p>"Good! mine's a pint of rum."</p>

<p>The driver shouted coffee royal and off they went again. This
was the only nourishment they had from breakfast time until 8
o'clock that night. Evidently the army regulation of twenty-four
hours' rations for moving troops did not apply to hospital patients
in transit. Towards dusk the driver shouted again, but this time
only verbally.</p>

<p>"London Bridge!"</p>

<p>"Is that all." "Where does the King hang out?" "How about taking
us to the Palace for the night?"</p>

<p>"Houses of Parliament!&mdash;The Abbey!" again the driver
shouted.</p>

<p>"B&mdash;&mdash; the Abbey, we want a feed." "Step on it."
"Where's this 'Wherefield' joint, how much farther."</p>

<p>"Won't be long n&mdash;" swissh! the vehicle went from one side
of the road to the other, came halfway back, and then turned
completely round.</p>

<p>"What the Hell!"</p>

<p>"All right, only a skid."</p>

<p>"Cripes! Thought we'd arrived at Piccadilly Circus."</p>

<p>It was dark when they arrived at Harefield. The driver went to
the office only to return with the bad news:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait. You're not expected. Your papers have not
arrived."</p>

<p>"Bloody good job." "What a lousy hole." "Take us back to Fort
Pitt." "Tell 'em we'll call again to-morrow" were some of the
comments from the exasperated quartette.</p>

<p>A wait of about half an hour and a party of stretcher-bearers
arrived. Ted, who was dumped on to a hard bed on an open veranda,
asked for a drink of milk and was told to wait until supper time.
Stiff with the cold, aching, and hungry, he was undressed and
covered with bed clothes. Coming from a modern hospital where he
had enjoyed every comfort, including a water-filled mattress, it
was little wonder that this reception, following on the day's
miserable journey from Chatham, caused him much distress. All at
once, he heard a genial voice exclaim:</p>

<p>"What's up, 'Muscles,' do you feel cold?"</p>

<p>Looking up, Ted-saw the smiling face of a Digger, and glancing
down, observed that he had lost a leg. But that was more than Ike
could see of Ted, and so, wondering just how much of him was left,
he had called the boy "Muscles." "Mutton" at school because he was
fat; "Bargo" because he had a big head; "Freezer" at Liverpool
Camp, because of his tailless shirt; "Enfant" in France; and just
recently "Bill"&mdash;all these went the way of most youthful
nicknames, but "Muscles" (more affectionately "Muss") was to be a
fixture. At the time, or rather two days later, he weighed six
stone ten.</p>

<p>Muscles laughed and said "Yes," he felt cold. Ike went off on
his crutches to return with two blankets and a hot-water
bottle&mdash;off his own bed, but Muss did not know of that until
the following morning, when he learnt that Ike had spent the night
sitting by the fire in the ward.</p>

<p>So far, Ike was the only bright being in this otherwise
cheerless place. In comparison with the sisters at Chatham, those
so far met with here seemed indifferent, but perhaps this judgment
was not quite fair, because there is no doubt that Ted had been
spoiled at Fort Pitt. In the early hours of the morning, someone
helped him to drink a mug of coffee, but he was overlooked at
wash-time. When dawn broke, the top blanket was frozen hard, and
icicles hanging from the iron roof overhead began to drip. An
orderly put a plate of chops on his locker and promised to come
back and cut them up; they were still there when a bright little
V.A. came along about an hour later. "Hello," she said, "a new
patient. Hurry up and get better, Daddy wants you back in
France."</p>

<p>"And who's 'Daddy'?" queried Ted.</p>

<p>"General Birdwood. Don't you know my daddy?"</p>

<p>"Know him! Yes, but he'll have to wait. I want someone to cut
and hand me my breakfast. I want a wash. I want my dressing done. I
want to see the matron, the head quack. I want to tell 'em what I
think of this damn joint. I want to get out of it, not die in it. I
want&mdash;" but Miss Birdwood had vanished to return with two hot
chops and some comforting words and smiles. Good.</p>

<p>About midday the doctor came. Ted was moved into the ward, where
his dressing was fixed. The doctor wanted to try and pull a piece
of bone out of his arm, but Ted would not let him.</p>

<p>"I've got my instructions from Colonel Ryan. My wing's not to be
touched until I get home."</p>

<p>"Very well, Muscles." Even the doctor had it.</p>

<p>"D'you call this a hospital? I've got a better fowl house at
home."</p>

<p>His spirit evidently gave the impression that he was stronger
than he actually was, for two days later he was granted leave to go
to London. (At this time he had very little use of his left arm and
the right hung stiff at the side. Furthermore, he had to be lifted
on to his feet as he was unable by his own efforts to get off a
bed.) While two of the boys dressed him lying on the bed, the
inmates of the ward chaffed him about going to London.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Muscles?"</p>

<p>"London. How do you get to Winchmore Hill?"</p>

<p>"Ask a john. Who are you going to see there?"</p>

<p>"A friend."</p>

<p>"What's her name?" "Where d'you meet her?"</p>

<p>"Want someone to give you a hand?" "Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Ah, shut up, she's a friend I tell you."</p>

<p>"That all?" "Ha! ha! ha!" "He's goin' t' meet 'Arriet, 'ow abart
a fevver fer yer 'at? Who'll lend 'im 'is spurs?"</p>

<p>And then an elderly Digger chipped in: "Don't tork ta me about
English tarts, I got an eye-full of one comin' round a corner and
saw 'er feet forty seconds before 'er body. I'm waiting till I get
'ome ta see the missus."</p>

<p>"Don't forget to buy some 'undreds and thousands for the kids!"
"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"All set, Muss. You look good-oh."</p>

<p>"Have one for me"&mdash;but Ted did not wait for any more.</p>

<p>The overcoat and boots, however, were too heavy for his weak
frame. When he reached the gate of the hospital he was sagging at
the knees and had to lean against a post, and when he got going
again he fell over in the snow. Someone came and picked him up.</p>

<p>"Struth! It's Muscles. Where d'you get the booze? Cripes, you
look crook. Where you going?"</p>

<p>"London, Winch&mdash;" Ted woke up in the ward, hot bottles at
his feet and sides. A doctor and a sister were bending over him.
"Feel all right now?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, good" but he was not so good, nor did he again get out of
bed until two weeks later on board the hospital ship.</p>

<p>There is no record of his having composed a soldier's farewell
to Harefield, but on 18 February he wrote, or rather "printed" in
back-hand italics, the following letter:</p>

<p class="letter">No. 1 Ward,<br>
No. 1 A.A.H.,<br>
Harefield.<br>
18/2/'17.<br>
<br>
MY DEAR MOTHER AND FATHER,<br>
<br>
You will think I have forgotten you all at home, but you see I am
laid up in bed again with a rotten cold. I have been here twelve
days now and am waiting for the boat to leave for home. Mrs B. took
me to her place for tea the Sunday before leaving Chatham, and my
word I had a jolly good time. I have been very lucky with mail from
home; received letters written just before Xmas a few days ago,
also photos which I think are tip top. I am sending you a photo
taken just after a fall of snow at the end of our ward. You will
hardly recognize me, as I am so thin; but never mind, the grin is
still there, and that is the main thing. Obtained leave to go and
stay with Mrs C. at London for six days, only my cold was too bad
and my fiver had sadly gone "mafeesh." Now I have a little job for
each at home: First of all I would like Marion to learn a few
tunes&mdash;"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-bag," and "Home
in Tennessee"; Ned can clean out the top right-hand drawer of the
dressing-table for my odds and ends; Col can hunt round and find my
old tan boots, and Ruby can make up her mind which chair is the
most comfy. Mother will make a nice hot scone and a cup of old
Mossip's tea. Now as Dad is too old to work, he had better see that
all these jobs are carried out O.K. The news has just come round
that the boat leaves on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="cp">(25 February&mdash;11 April 1917)</p>

<hr>

<p class="poem">You forget your load of sorrow,<br>
Coming home...<br>
It will wait until the morrow,<br>
Coming home...</p>

<p>"Struth! This ain't the last carriage on the Rookwood express.
Can't some of youse blokes talk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is not unlike a travelling morgue, ha! ha! ha! So the
Rookwood worms will pick our bones after all."</p>

<p>"They won't get much off you, Muscles."</p>

<p>"Never mind, small fish are sweet. Have you ever heard that
song, 'Cockles and Muscles, Alive, Alive-o'?"</p>

<p>"No, but I've heard 'Old Soldiers Never Die.'"</p>

<p>And then, with the exception of one, they (all cot cases)
sang:</p>

<p class="poem">Old soldiers never die,<br>
Never die, never die;<br>
Old soldiers never die,<br>
They simply fade away.</p>

<p>"Hey you! wake up" yelled one of them to the non-singer, "and
I'll intradooce y' to the corpses. I'm Andy, a spine; that's Jim,
'e's a spine, too, an' so's Arthur over there. They calls Muscles a
spine 'cause that's all that's left of 'im; Tom, 'e's lorst a arm,
a leg, an' a eye, so we calls 'im Lord Silver, bein' a cross
between Lord Nelson and John Silver the bloke in <i>Treasure

<p>"Me? I'm a nut."</p>

<p>"Blimey, you're stiff, where d'you do it?"</p>

<p>"Do it? Did nothin', remember nothin' till I wakes up in the
gigglin' 'ouse and 'ere I am a nut case&mdash;quite
'armless&mdash;goin' 'ome."</p>

<p>The "nut" was promptly given the name of "Ed," intended as an
abbreviation of "head." He accepted this as being derived from
"lead" and said his second name was "Swinger." With a knowing
twinkle in his eyes, he led the singing:</p>

<p class="poem">I want to go home, I want to go home,<br>
I don't want to go to the trenches no more,<br>
Where the minnies and whizz-bangs, they whistle and roar&mdash;<br>
Take me over the sea, where the Allemand can't snipe at me;<br>
Oh! my, I don't want to die,<br>
I want to go home.</p>

<p>And so, on 21 February 1917, the hospital
train&mdash;comfortable, well appointed, and fully
staffed&mdash;glided on over the rails with its complement of
maimed yet happy Australians, all cheered up to be returning home.
Within half an hour of leaving Harefield all were on as familiar
terms as though they had left Australia together. Discussing their
various ports of destination and indulging in some of the old
interstate banter. The conversation then turned to speculating on
the prospects of a good trip, the possibility of being hindered by
German "tin fish," and (at great length) the likely quality of the
food on board the hospital ship.</p>

<p>One Digger, who had been A.W.L. from Hare-field for some time,
gave a very illuminating account of his experiences and said that
his wife, Mrs Sydney Harbour, would probably be following him out
in the next boat. At this he turned a bit sentimental and said he
was sorry he had given a crook name, because she was not a bad sort
and perhaps he might do worse.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the train reached Avonmouth. The hospital
ship had not arrived, and rumour had it that she had been
torpedoed. Some hours later the train moved on to Bristol, where
the patients were transferred to a hospital. After a long day
without a midday meal, the disappointment of not embarking cast an
air of gloom over the troops, but this was soon eased by the good
folk of Bristol who turned out in force to meet the train and
supply refreshments at the station. Early next morning they were
taken back to the train, and given a rousing send off, and, on
arrival at Avonmouth, embarked on H.M.A.H.S. <i>Karoola</i> without
further delay.</p>

<p>The <i>Karoola,</i> one of the best known passenger-ships on the
Australian coast, had been converted into a most modern and
comfortable hospital ship. Painted white above a red water-line,
with a green band&mdash;broken by three red crosses on each
side&mdash;running right round the centre of the hull from stem to
stern; flying the Red Cross flag at the forward mast-head and the
Blue Ensign aft; with her trim lines she made a delightful picture
by day. Brightly illuminated with red crosses and green lights by
night, she was a floating enchantment. The wards were well fitted
up, with swinging cots to counteract the movement of the ship. The
all-Australian staff, particularly the sisters, and even members of
the crew, capably and cheerfully ministered to the well-being of
the patients, who, in turn, reacted to the atmosphere and, despite
physical suffering, enjoyed the trip.</p>

<p>The staff work connected with the embarkation of the invalids
might have been arranged more efficiently. Instead of patients
being detailed to wards according to the nature of their
disabilities, they were accommodated indiscriminately, and the
subsequent sorting out and transferring threw extra work on to the
shoulders of the <i>Karoola's</i> medical personnel and caused
patients some irritation.* However, within twenty-four hours of
sailing, everything had been straightened out and was working
smoothly, and all the "has beens" were elated to be southward
bound.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is quite likely, however, that submarine
activity in the Channel delayed the arrival of the <i>Karoola</i>
and necessitated a hurried departure, in which case the fault did
not lie with the A.I.F. staff.]</p>

<p>Ted's day in the "steerage" ward, before being transferred to
the more comfortable "dining saloon" ward, was not altogether an
unfortunate experience, for it was in the steerage that he made the
acquaintance of Sister D. Not that the staff of the new ward did
not treat him well, in fact they, and in particular Sister S.,
spoiled him. But D., when off duty, would come under cover of
darkness, after lights out, to give him cheer and comforts not
prescribed by the M.O. nor allowed by the Matron. Being the most
youthful patient on the ship had its compensations.</p>

<p>"She's forgotten you to-night, Muscles," someone would say.</p>

<p>"You're the snowy headed boy, all right."</p>

<p>"Change you beds, Muss."</p>

<p>"How d' y' do it?"</p>

<p>And so on they would chaff him until her white-clad form
appeared coming down the dimly lit companionway.</p>

<p>"Here she comes, Muss."</p>

<p>"Give him a fair go" from someone in a loud whisper, and then
complete silence.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the form of Thomas M., one of the ship's
firemen, clad in dark flannel shirt, grimy trousers, and sweat-rag
neckerchief, would appear and silently join D. at Ted's cot, with
his nightly present of a bottle of English stout. Kneeling beside
the low cot he would whisper his rough yet golden words of comfort
while D. attended to the ministering of his gift to Ted.
Immediately the bottle was empty Thomas would stow it and the glass
inside his shirt, and with a cheery good-night leave them until the
morrow. 'Tis not often the lot of man to know the love of mankind
without others exhibiting jealousy and robbing it of its virtue.
But here, as in England, Ted was fortunate, and even the other
patients, some more badly disabled than himself, gave him freely of
their cheer and consideration wherever possible. For example, there
was Smithy, a half-caste, who had lost portion of each foot through
"trench feet." He occupied the next cot and helped with his rough
songs and rougher yarns to keep Ted cheered. During the visits of
D., he invariably kept his back turned on the company and gave
occasional reassuring snores.</p>

<p>As time went on Ted was able to get about a little and made the
acquaintance of a grey-headed cot case who, when under the
influence of morphia, played most delightfully on his cornet. At
other times he was most despondent, but would always play something
for Muscles, who visited him often. The poor old chap was one of
six who died on the way home. He was buried at sea on the very day
a mock burial had been arranged for Ted's bottle of ribs. His last
request was for Muscles, and, although too ill to play the cornet,
he yet found a smile when he heard of the arrangements made for the
mock burial.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <i>Karoola</i> at Durban will ever remain
fresh in the memory of those who saw and could read Miss Ethel
Campbell's well semaphored messages of greeting, as she stood out
on the end of the breakwater with her hair waving in the breeze.
She and her band of willing helpers met every troop-laden ship
which had the good fortune to call at Durban, and entertained most
lavishly the khaki-clad travellers and homeward bound invalids.
Having waved and signalled her greeting, Miss Campbell hurried to
the wharf where, attended by a Kaffir servant, she threw fruit and
cigarettes to the boys as the ship drew alongside.</p>

<p>Later, she distributed copies of her glowing tributes to the
Anzacs:</p>

<p class="newspaper">ANZACS<br>
<br>
What mean these great white ships at sea, ploughing their eastward
tack,<br>
Bearing their mangled human freight, bringing the spent men
back?<br>
They mean that Australia has been there, they mean she has played
the game,<br>
And her wonderful sons have won their share of everlasting
fame.<br>
<br>
Battered, and worn, and war scarred&mdash;those who had left their
land<br>
Strong in their glowing manhood, by England to take their
stand;<br>
Those who had sailed, when the war cloud burst, out on a distant
foam<br>
To the tune of "Australia Will be There"&mdash;thus are they coming
home.<br>
<br>
What mean these absent numbers, the gaps in the stricken line?<br>
You will find the graves which tell you, on the trail by Lonesome
Pine:<br>
On the slopes of Achi Baba, on Koja Chemen's brow,<br>
They died the death of heroes, as Australia's sons know how.<br>
<br>
Eager for battle they leapt ashore at the cove where their name was
won,<br>
They stormed the cliffs of Sari Bair, where the death trap gullies
run;<br>
In the lead-rent scrub by Krithia, on the banks of Kereves
Dere,<br>
High on the shell-swept ridges&mdash;Australia has been there!<br>
<br>
There is silence on the beaches now, the battle-din has fled<br>
From the gullies, cliffs, and ridges where they charged up, fought
and bled.<br>
There's a little cove that's sacred&mdash;north of Gaba Tepe
Hill&mdash;<br>
To the glory of the men who died, and a name that never will!<br>
<br>
There are great white vessels sailing, and they bear the joy and
pain,<br>
And the glory of Australia's sons who have not bled in vain;<br>
Tho' crippled, helpless, maimed for life, tho' more than death
their loss,<br>
There is more than life in the glory of the burden of their
cross.<br>
<br>
Greater than jewel-decked Emperor, greater than ermined King,<br>
Clad in their faded suits of blue, the men that the white ships
bring;<br>
What tho' their crown a bandage, stretcher or cot their throne,<br>
Splints or a crutch their sceptre&mdash;the Anzac name is their
own!<br>
<br>
When our wonderful tale of Empire, is written in far-off days,<br>
Not least from its glowing pages, a little name will blaze;<br>
A little name will echo in the paen of our fame,<br>
In the glory of bur annals, there will live the Anzac name.<br></p>

<p>Patients well enough to go ashore were granted leave and issued
with passes on which were stamped both the official oval insignia
of the ship and either "walking patient," or "car patient" or "cot
patient" as the case may be, and, written in ink, the name of the
patient and number of his ward. Ted got a "cot patient" pass which
meant that he was to take his leave on a stretcher, but an invalid
artist who was selling hand painted and forged "walking patient"
passes at five shillings each presented one to Ted.</p>

<p>Another chap arranged for a rickshaw to hurry himself and Ted
away once they were free of the guard on the gangway, and they
spent an enjoyable hour or two seeing the sights of Durban. The
rickshaw boy, wearing a ferocious horned head-dress, turned out to
be a master of his art. He would shy like a horse at a piece of
flying paper and yell and run like Hell, sometimes not touching the
ground for twenty yards or more as he balanced in the shafts going
down hill.</p>

<p>Going by car in the company of two ladies of Miss Campbell's
brigade, Ted and his mate and four other patients were entertained
at lunch in a private home on the outskirts of the town, and, after
enjoying a most happy afternoon, they wero taken by Mr and Mrs
F.C.S. of Johannesburg to the leading hotel for dinner. Without
doubt this was the most sumptuous dinner any one of those six
Diggers had ever attended. Unfortunately one of their number
proceeded to make an exhibition of himself, much to the disgust and
annoyance of the others. Calling the Kaffir waiters by Gyppo names,
he ordered his requirements in that language and it was well that
his hosts did not understand what he said. When someone tried to
give him the office by gently kicking his wounded leg under the
table, he offered to fight the whole "bleedin' lot of y's" when
they returned to the ship. Having kept a course ahead of everyone
he finished up with a soup spoon and finger bowl, and, after
tasting a few spoonfuls of the water, said: "Struth! I don't go
much on this stuff." He then proceeded to complain that all the
pubs in Durban were shut up when Australians came there, but were
left open to the New Zealanders. Mr and Mrs F.C.S., whose generous
hospitality was not forgotten by the other five Diggers, sat
through the dinner cheerfully.</p>

<p>On returning to the ship with a parcel of souvenir presents for
the folk at home, one of the patients, Stan A., discovered that Ted
was a present short and insisted on advancing him ten shillings to
make the necessary purchase. The lender was disembarking at
Melbourne but he did not mention this to Ted, and so the debt
stood.</p>

<p>Two days were all too short to spend with Miss Campbell and her
charming friends in their delightful city with its ocean beach,
esplanade, rickshaws, and other interesting features.</p>

<p>The voyage so far had each day seen an improvement in Ted's
condition, and the interlude at Durban put him on his feet. Had
authority been content to let this state of convalescence continue,
the patient would no doubt have been in a comparatively fit
condition to face whatever surgical treatment was deemed necessary
at the conclusion of the voyage. Authority, however, had other
ideas and insisted on removing pieces of bone from the arm.
Heedless of Ted's protest that Colonel Ryan and others had advised
that no further operation be performed upon him until arrival in
Australia, the "sawbones" brought pressure to bear by threatening
that a pension might not be granted if the operation were refused.
There was no immediate necessity for the operation&mdash;the
patient's condition was improving&mdash;and the shipboard
facilities, no matter how good, could not equal those of a general
hospital. Furthermore, owing to the patient's chest condition,
there was a distinct danger of subsequent complications.</p>

<p>Many were the complaints of those who were practically
shanghaied to the operating table. Ted was one of five who, on the
morning of his operation, attended the orderly corporal's "boogee"
parade. Something of a humorist, this N.C.O. called it the
"physical works parade," and, lining up his victims, he proceeded,
to carry out the manoeuvre in burlesque regimental style.</p>

<p>Ted's operation was not a success&mdash;it resulted in a bad
haemorrhage, increased pain in the region of the wound, further
loss of feeling in the hand, and his return to the D.I. list.
Incidentally it was also responsible for the loss of a souvenir
wristlet watch which disappeared from his person while he was under
the anaesthetic.</p>

<p>Affixed to the bulkhead immediately in front of Ted's cot was a
copper sterilizer. The "nut" case whose particular fancy it was to
polish this every day for hours on end, and gape at his inane
reflection therein, was even more irritating than the pain and
illness following the operation. Still Ted might have found it
worse had he been located in the ward where one of the "nuts"
chanted the Lord's Prayer continuously for two days and three
nights ere he died.</p>

<p>As soon as Ted felt able to stand the journey, he one evening
prevailed on Fireman Thomas, though without the sanction of the
M.O., whom he was determined to ignore&mdash;to carry him to the
foc's'le where he enjoyed an extra bottle of stout and a few dips
in the "black pan"&mdash;a tin sent to the foc's'le crew after the
officers' mess and containing the assorted leavings of their menu.
Thus, ere the ship reached Fremantle, Ted was again able to get
about, though not with official consent.</p>

<p>Not more than a few hours were spent by the ship at the various
ports of call in Australia. Those disembarking took what might have
appeared to be casual leave of their shipmates, but the parting was
in fact deeply felt by all. They did not make promises to write,
but just flung a "Cheerio," "So long," or "Good luck" to one
another or banteringly remarked: "Keep your legs together," "What
do you think of our 'arbour?" "Don't get stuck in the Yarra," "See
you at the next war." Ted's Durban creditor did not even bother to
let anyone know he was leaving the ship at Melbourne&mdash;he just
went.</p>

<p>Words, what words were there that could express the feelings and
thoughts of these men? None. They were members of a freemasonry
that had endured many partings&mdash;partings from loved ones at
home, with old cobbers, with English and foreign brothers and
sisters of the craft, with those "gone west." But their bonds of
friendship, moulded in an atmosphere of mutual suffering, sympathy,
and good fellowship, would endure. Words were unnecessary.
Materially, they had parted&mdash;were parting; spiritually, they
were together. Life would see many reunions, and in passing they
would but part to meet again.</p>

<p>The evening of the last day found Ted alone on the boat-deck. He
had gone there to see the sun set, and in the tranquillity of its
fading light and changing hues his thoughts went fleeting over the
days he had been absent from home. Lingering here and there to hold
the happy memories; passing quickly over the sordidness, the
horrors, the sufferings, and his own maimed state; yet ever mindful
of those who, like the setting sun, had gone west, he felt not the
glamour of heroics but rather the pathos of this eventide that
signified the passing of so much&mdash;the venture, the great
experience, had ended&mdash;the sun had set.</p>

<p>Contemplation of the future did not extend beyond the morrow.
Would he be granted leave? No, he was marked down for transport by
ambulance to Randwick Hospital. Still, he would have to work it
somehow, if only for a few hours, so that the folk at home would
feel less the shock of his condition. Would his mother and father
reproach themselves for having allowed him to go away? Surely not,
it was not their fault, they did not start the war&mdash;but, once
started, someone had to go. The fault&mdash;yes, there must be a
fault&mdash;belonged to civilization generally. Did he himself
regret having gone away? No, that would be tantamount to his
repudiation of all the personal compensations and associations, but
he did regret that civilization permitted war and so robbed itself
of its best material&mdash;its youth.</p>

<p>But the morrow. Would they have a car to meet him? He hoped so.
Would there be a lot of fuss? He hoped not, and prayed that his
first day at least would be spent only with his own folk. There
would be lots of time to see the others, and to listen to their
foolish questions and be embarrassed by their hero worship. How
disappointed some of them would be to hear that he had not killed a
Fritz, yet how horrified if they learnt that he was credited with
having dispatched a Gyppo. And there were other things that would
horrify them. There was, thought Ted miserably, nothing to justify
his appearing in the role of a soldier who had heroically served
his country. Explanations would be futile&mdash;folks would not
understand, but would put it down to his modesty! Yet, if it were
possible to give adequate expression to his experiences and
thoughts, he would, if believed, be branded a blackguard and a
coward. Better then to say nothing. Let them think him a modest
hero, let them continue to paint glamorous pictures of the war and
their cause, at least until the rotten business was over&mdash;one
way or the other; then, perhaps, the old soldiers of the world
would join together in one great army to oppose tooth and nail
those who upheld war as a means of settling international disputes.
Yes, he would enlist in that "army" if it came into being, but, at
present, his voice would only fall on unheeding, if not deaf,
ears&mdash;if perchance they were noticed, he would probably be put
away in some concentration camp or other for making seditious
utterances. For the present, therefore, it were best, if unable to
encourage enlistment, not to hinder it, so that the bitter end
might come the sooner. And, for one who was of no further active
use, well there was nothing left but to make the best of a bad lot,
have a good time, try and find a place in civilian life, keep
smiling and&mdash;forget.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX. HOME AND
HOSPITAL</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">The sun
rises&mdash;The Heads and the Harbour&mdash;Mother!&mdash;The
tumult and the shouting dies&mdash;Randwick Remnants&mdash;Ops and
hops&mdash;An auction sale&mdash;A <i>Karoola</i>
welcome&mdash;Discharge.</p>

<p class="cp">(12 April&mdash;12 October 1917)</p>

<hr>

<p>Thursday, 12 April 1917, dawned as the <i>Karoola</i> approached
Sydney Heads. Day and date in themselves were of little
concern&mdash;what really mattered was that <i>the clay</i> had at
last arrived. As the sun came up in all its glory and the mists of
dawn lifted to reveal the gateway to home, all eyes strained to
glimpse the landmarks that had faded from their vision, what seemed
like ages ago. Middle Head: may its guns be heard only in practice
and its scrub and gum-trees never be splintered and ravaged by
enemy shells. Manly, Watson's Bay, Bradley's Head; sheltered coves
and golden beaches; the ferries, their cock-a-doodle-doos; distant
coo-ees...Home.</p>

<p>Military and medical officers boarded the ship at Watson's Bay
and established themselves at a table on the promenade deck. As the
troops filed past they were issued with leave passes according to
the information they volunteered regarding their wounds and
condition. Of course all vowed they were feeling fine; and Ted,
like many others with open wounds, lied that his were completely
healed. In point of fact, there was a hole right through his arm,
but D. had filled his pocket with dressings and his head with
instructions for their application.</p>

<p>Coming up Woolloomooloo Bay one chap excitedly pointed out what
he claimed to be his old home, a cave in the bank of the Domain; he
supposed he would have to refurnish it, and anticipated some
difficulty in getting hold of a good German piano case.</p>

<p>"Got your ribs packed?" someone asked Muscles.</p>

<p>"Yes! Why?" Ted replied.</p>

<p>"You know Adam gave one rib and got one wife. Don't know what
you are going to do with seven. Thought you might lend me a
couple."</p>

<p>As they were warped into No. 1 Wharf the Liverpool Military Band
played "Home Sweet Home." On the wharf a general and his staff of
"brass-hats" presented a stiff and formal welcome party, which was
in marked contrast to the emotional throng that would have attended
had red tape and war precautions regulations permitted. The band,
now playing martial airs, rekindled some of the old fire; the
troops, lining the railings, found voice to cheer again and again
until the Red Cross motor cars came to transport them to where
their loved ones were waiting.</p>

<p>What the official welcome on the wharf lacked in warmth was more
than compensated for by the cheering crowds that lined the road
leading to the Anzac Buffet in the Domain, and there, 'neath a
canopy of evergreen trees pierced with bright shafts of streaming
Aussie sunlight, a different welcome was enacted. Standing on
tiptoe, their strained, eager and expectant faces all directed
towards the incoming cars, were mothers, fathers, wives,
sweethearts, sisters, brothers; some flushed with excitement,
others white in dread&mdash;for the names of the cot cases had not
yet been announced. As the men arrived their faces were closely
scanned by the throng.</p>

<p>"There he is!"</p>

<p>"Bill!"</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>A young mother is seen holding aloft a child, that it may see
its father first and for the first time; and there, two V.As are
supporting an aged woman in black who holds a tiny Union Jack in
her trembling hand. "Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" are heard the cheers
from the roadway&mdash;still they come.</p>

<p>The first greeting is over. "The tumult and the shouting dies."
Red Cross workers present each man with a box of comforts, V.As
distribute refreshments, smokes, and flowers; newspaper reporters
butt in everywhere.</p>

<p class="newspaper">The <i>Karoola,</i> looking rather
weather-beaten, had her rails lined by the returned men, who
cheered and cheered again as the band played patriotic airs. The
majority of them were men who had fought in France, some of those
who had taken part in the first big push. Nearly every case was a
surgical one&mdash;that is, he had been wounded and was not
returned through sickness. Though all looked bright and cheerful
enough, it was easy to see that most of them had been through
scenes and taken part in battles that would not bear talking of; in
fact, it was a hard job to get any man to talk about himself; he
would tell you what the next fellow had done, but when one asked
for first-hand stories, a look would come into the eyes of the men
that forbade further inquiries.</p>

<p>Such was the preamble of one report for the remainder of which
the writer proceeded to draw on his imagination and on hearsay.
"Boy Hero Comes Home," "Young Soldier Hero," "Boy Soldier's Silver
Ribs" (but nothing about his tin &mdash;&mdash;) were some of the
headings to the wild fictions published by the Press.</p>

<p>A car took Ted to his home. But the house did not look the
same&mdash;it was camouflaged with bunting, which was not at all to
his liking. The whole population of the
neighbourhood&mdash;including its dogs, which celebrated the
occasion by having an all-in fight&mdash;was gathered at the gate.
Other friends and relations, some of whom had not so much as
bothered to write a few lines to their "hero," took up a grandstand
position on the veranda. As the procession filed in, someone played
"Here the Conquering Hero Comes," a dentist greeted Ted by
examining his teeth and proclaiming for all to hear that he would
do them free of charge, someone began to cry. Dad and Ted thereupon
adjourned to the woodshed for a yarn, and it was not until the
early hours of the following morning that mother and son had an
opportunity for quiet talk.</p>

<p>Their curiosity satisfied, their duty done, their emotions again
normal, and having had their fill, the visitors
departed&mdash;mostly for ever. A few, in addition to some who gave
practical demonstration of their understanding by staying away that
morning, are firm friends of Ted to-day. Some sent greetings, one
sent a lounge chair, another offered the use of his seaside home
whenever required. Such gifts were not expected, but were
appreciated, not so much for their material value, but for the
unostentatious and unpatronizing manner in which they were given.
Friendships must stand the test of time&mdash;few did. Because Ted
did not tell them all about the war; because he did not respond to
their parrot-like speeches of welcome, except to say thanks;
because he clearly demonstrated his desire to be alone with his
home folk that day&mdash;most of them found him uninteresting and
passed on.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday afternoon Ted was officially welcomed
by the Mayor and other citizens, and in the evening he was tendered
a party. But he found that, because of his inability to join in the
dancing and games, he was left alone. The honoured guest of the
evening? Bah! The excuse for the evening. But he continued to
smile, for he thought of the old <i>estaminet,</i> and his old
cobbers. Bah! These folk did not know how to stage a party. He
sought out his Dad and went home.</p>

<p>And so, except for leaving the comforts and company of his home,
he was glad when, a few days later, he moved to Randwick Hospital
to rejoin those who knew him as Muscles and understood.</p>

<p>On the way to the hospital, Ted met an old cobber. This chap had
been admitted to the institution on the previous day, and his
opinion was that it "is not a bad joint, fair amount of leave,
tucker's not bad, sisters good-oh, there's a guard on the gate, but
lower down you can get under the fence. Having a beano down the
quarry to-night&mdash;come?"</p>

<p>Ted was admitted to one of the huts, to find that every one of
the other patients was absent, with or without leave. The orderly
on duty inquired if Ted would be dining in and gave him the choice
of several dishes, which were duly served up at 4 o'clock with much
rattling of crockery and with complaints regarding the arduous
nature of the orderlie's work. After this he took a stroll through
the grounds, inspecting the hole under the fence and the location
of the quarry, and visited the wards in the main building where the
more serious cases were quartered. The <i>Karoola</i> cot cases in
J ward gave him a welcome and introduced him to the sisters and
other patients as "Muscles." One sister, dressing his arm, said he
should not be in a convalescent ward, and took it upon herself to
arrange for his transfer to hers a few days later. Evidently she
also considered that he needed an escort, there being no other
apparent reason for her acceptance of his oft-repeated invitations
to accompany him on the evenings when he was given leave of
absence.</p>

<p>But to return to the first evening. Ted found himself at the
quarry with some twenty other <i>Karoola</i> boys, who had met to
"spend the evening." He was just in time to hear Jawbone Joe
address the gathering:</p>

<p>"Fellow stiffs and sadly spent six-bob-a-day
tourists&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Hurray!"</i>
</p>

<p>"&mdash;we meet on this most unauspicious occasion to console
with each other on having returned to civilization. Our
trippings&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Ah, shut up."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Let him mag, he's practising for his old job with the
thimble and pea."</i>
</p>

<p>"&mdash;As I was about to say when you interrupted my
eloquence&mdash;our trippings aboard palatial ocean liners, viewing
delightful Egyptian wonders, dreaming 'neath romantic Eastern
skies, revelling in frolics and follies in France, enjoying the
restfulness and peace of Old England&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Give 'im a drink, for Gawd's sake, afore 'e busts."</i>
</p>

<p>"&mdash;and generally having a good time despite having to live
with ignorant people who speak out of their turn&mdash;have come to
an end&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Pity you didn't come to your end."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"He soon will if he keeps this up."</i>
</p>

<p>"The first business of this meeting is to have another little
drink. Pass the pinky. Now, all together&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Here's to good old beer, mop it down, mop it
down,<br>
Here's to good old beer, mop it down:<br>
Here's to good old beer, it's all that's left to cheer,<br>
Here's to good old beer, mop it down.</p>

<p>"The next business on the agenda is confirmation of the minutes
of our last meeting. The secretary reports having lost the records
at the landing at Woolloomooloo. It is, therefore, unanimously
carried that his action be endorsed, that we forget ever having had
any past records&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"The police won't forget yours."</i>
</p>

<p>"&mdash;and that we reconstitute ourselves a new body. While
Fred&mdash;yes, it's Fred's turn&mdash;goes to get
'reinforcements,' we'll drink what's left and then proceed to adopt
our constitution.</p>

<p>"The association formed under these rules shall be known as the
'Randwick Remnants.'</p>

<p>"The objects of the Remnants shall be:</p>

<p>"(a) To stimulate Australian interests and increase government
revenue by</p>

<p>"(b) Enhancing the value of brewery shares and giving a fillip
to the fish industry by</p>

<p>"(c) Eating crays, crabs, prawns, and other such salt fish at
such times and in such quantities as may be sufficient but not more
than necessary to produce a thirst equal to our liquid capacities
or financial resources, whichever is the lesser&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Whichever the lesser? Wait till I works it
out&mdash;'struth, Joe, that's not necessary, or the fish. Why,
there's not enough dough in the world to satisfy our normal
thirsts."</i>
</p>

<p>"&mdash;Well, get on with it while I finish reading the rules.
The slogan of the Remnants shall be: 'Eat more fish, drink more
beer.' The passwords shall be: Inward, 'Gotabottle,' outward,
'Broke.' The terms of greeting shall be: 'Avadrink' and
'Avanother.'</p>

<p>"Before proceeding to general business&mdash;there's plenty
left&mdash;let us extend a welcome to Muscles. He is fined one
dozen beer and a half a dozen crays to be delivered on the ground
of our next meeting here, for not having brought a contribution
to-night. He is invested with the office of Chief Rabbit Runner, as
it is his good fortune to be able to secrete a bottle in his chest
without it being apparent to the guard. He is permitted to join
with us in the toast to himself which will now take the form of
general business."</p>

<p class="poem">"Here's to good old beer, mop it down, mop
it..."</p>

<p>This party, like many similar ones, was attended by the
individual not because he wanted a drink, but because, though
unknowingly, he wanted to recapture some of the old care-free
atmosphere and lightheartedness that prevailed on the other side.
The Remnants, whether or not they subscribed in full to the details
of their constitution as read, adopted the spirit and underlying
principle (not mentioned in the constitution) which they carry on
to this day. Comprising members of the professions, tradesmen,
unskilled workers, unemployed, and some still in hospital, they
have continued to hold "ordinary meetings" these seventeen years.
Unwritten additions and amendments have been made to the original
rules; the objects have been broadened and include help to the less
fortunate; the password "Broke" and suspension for being so have
been deleted. One member only wears the "badge" of membership which
he attributes to indigestion, but at all meetings, so long as one
financial member is present, "Avadrink" and "Avanother" remain the
terms of greeting.</p>

<p>At this stage of the war (1917) returned soldiers, irrespective
of their condition, were discharged from the army six months after
the date of their arrival home. Hospital treatment was, if
necessary, continued, in which case the only actual changes in a
man's lot were the differences between his former military pay (2
2s. 0d. per week) and the full pension (30s.), the wearing of mufti
instead of khaki, and, in case of death, the withdrawal of the
privilege of a military funeral!</p>

<p>In the early months of a soldier's return the surgical, medical,
nursing, and Red Cross treatment at Randwick was most
liberal&mdash;that is to say, a sick man had little if any cause
for complaint, and, once convalescent, he could proceed to make the
best of the free leg he was given, although licence invariably
resulted in a return to the sick list. Gradually, however, the
application of firm yet sympathetic discipline, and the submission
by the patient himself to the changing circumstances and
necessities of life, led to a general sobering down and contraction
of extremes, so that by the time the six months had elapsed the
majority of the patients were more or less reconciled to their
fate&mdash;repatriation and return to the conventional limits of
civilian life. Not so, however, the chronic and more badly
incapacitated cases, for whom the process of disciplining, treating
and nursing, sobering and repatriating was to be a long, and in
some cases life-long, task.</p>

<p>Numerous operations and lengthy confinements to bed gave Ted few
opportunities for getting off the chain, and in any case he usually
spent these brief intervals at home. Sometimes he would have a day
out with the troops and on the morrow attend the orderly room to
answer charges of being A.W.L., etc. On one occasion, at the
request of the organizer of a certain patriotic fund, he was given
special leave to appear with his souvenirs on the auction rostrum
in Martin Place, Sydney. The souvenirs included his bottle of ribs,
the time-fuse of the shell he had found in Egypt, a half-franc
piece won at Boulogne for sucking a raw egg, and a few pieces of
shrapnel. The auctioneer's assistant primed Ted and himself with a
bottle of whisky, purchased out of the funds, and then led Ted to
the slaughter.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," the auctioneer commenced, "this is the
World War's famous Muscles." (Much hand clapping and many hurrahs.)
He then proceeded to tell his hearers how Muscles, "the youngest
soldier on the Western Front," had done everything but win the
V.C., and, with further exaggerations, went on to describe how the
youth had risen from the dead and survived unheard of sufferings
and operations. "Here, ladies and gentlemen, are his ribs in a
bottle." Many white faces and tear-filled eyes were to be seen in
the audience, when someone suddenly called out, "'Ow d' we know
they ain't 'orses' ribs," and was promptly led away by a policeman.
A lady fainted. The auctioneer proceeded: "And this, ladies and
gentlemen" (holding up the time fuse) "is the top of the bomb that
blew his ribs away. What am I offered? Five pounds. Thank you.
Going at five&mdash;going&mdash;sixgoing at six, going at
six&mdash;gone." The souvenirs were sold, passed back to the
auctioneer, and resold until they realized some 50. Notes were
stuffed into Ted's pockets, without any check being made, but he
saw to it that all the money collected for the purpose was handed
into the fund. It would, however, be interesting to know what
proportion of the amounts collected for soldiers at such gatherings
went into the pockets of some of the war-time spruiking
opportunists.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The nearest Ted ever got to material contact with the past was
when he stowed away in an ambulance going to meet the
<i>Karoola</i> on her subsequent arrival from overseas. He was thus
enabled to get on to the wharf, where he took up a position in
front of the official party and extended a welcome to the sisters
and other members of the staff and the crew. The kiss D. gave him
as they met on the wharf was the signal for a burst of cheering
from the troops lining the decks, and frowns from some of the
brass-hats.</p>

<p>On 12 October 1917, Ted attended the Victoria Barracks to
collect his honourable discharge. At the same time he was given an
order for 30s. in lieu of a ready-made suit and cap, two returned
soldiers' badges, and 22 13s. 0d. on account of final settlement,
all this being noted on the parchment certificate of discharge.
Walking across the parade ground his thoughts might have slipped
back to the days when he had battled there with the old
sergeant-major for the privilege of serving his country or
satisfying his quest for adventure&mdash;which? Perhaps both, but
it mattered not...he passed through the gates and out of the army
for ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI. WINGIES AND
PEGGIES</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Dope&mdash;A few of
the boys&mdash;Some theatre parties&mdash;The new guard&mdash;To
Melbourne and back to the dope.</p>

<p class="cp">(1917-1918)</p>

<hr>

<p>Leaving the army, however, did not mean good-bye to all that. It
simply marked but another phase of war in which Ted carried on.
During the next two years the habit&mdash;started some months prior
to his discharge from the A.I.F.&mdash;of taking morphia, both
medically prescribed and otherwise procured from dope agents,
became a mania with him. The usual dose, one quarter-grain,
gradually increased until he could take as much as ten grains at a
time. Surgical treatment during this period was concerned mostly
with the right arm; but adhesions as well as sharp spurs growing on
the ends of several ribs, and the formation of nerve bulbs in the
chest wound, were the more painful. So severe, in fact, was this
condition that a deep breath or sudden movement, when he was not
under the influence of morphia, would cause him to suffer
unbearable pain. As his condition gradually became worse and daily
administrations of morphia increased, Ted's resistance to pain and
to drugs became less and less.</p>

<p>Except for the development of keen cunning in the art of
procuring, secreting, and taking the dope, degeneration of his
other faculties did not ensue. Conversely, as is the case with some
subjects, morphia had the effect of stimulating mind and body to
action, otherwise death or insanity must have resulted instead of
the apparently impossible accomplishments of the time.</p>

<p>The military hospital was a good market for the war-profiteer
whose nefarious business was the selling of drugs. Morphia, heroin,
atropine, barbatone, cocaine "snow," and even opium, found their
way into the hospital unsuspected, while the attention of the
authorities was directed towards suppressing the lesser and only
apparent evil&mdash;drink. A hollow bed-post, a cake of soap, and
many other things provided suitable hiding-places, and a cunningly
contrived fountain-pen, more than once lent to an unsuspecting
sister to write her report or mark a chart, concealed a hypodermic
syringe. Hypodermic administration has the surest and quickest
effect, but countless injections leave tell-tale marks and are apt
eventually to paralyse the punctured limb. It was the usual
practice to take a maximum dose by this means and to prolong the
effect by absorbing a number of tablets placed under the tongue.
Harmless saline or sterilized water was sometimes ordered by a
doctor for a patient suffering from the mental want of morphia
rather than from physical pain, and, though in many cases this had
the desired effect, it failed to act with the addict who realized
the difference before or immediately after he felt the prick of the
needle.</p>

<p>Drugs had to be bought. The maximum pension of those days, 30s.
per week, was insufficient to provide these and other requirements
for a man used to having all his wants satisfied. Art leather-work
was taken up as a means of supplementing the pension. The
manufacture of slippers, embossed hand-bags, writing cases, etc.,
had in Ted's case, to be entirely carried out with a single arm,
and partially disabled at that, yet ingenious contrivances overcame
the problems and at one stage his weekly income from this hospital
occupation reached 20.</p>

<p>That this work was carried on to such advantage, despite the
physical disabilities of the workers, is a tribute, firstly, to the
members of the Red Cross who gave instruction in arts and crafts;
and, secondly, to the sympathetic folk who purchased the wares. It
might be said that full advantage was taken of the times, and high
prices were charged accordingly. For example, from a sheepskin
suede, costing from 5s. to 6s., could be made four or five pairs of
moccasins which sold at 12s. 6d. per pair. The time taken to
complete a pair was 45 minutes. (Jack B., or "Joe Gardiner" as he
was nicknamed, could cut out and make up a pair in 22 minutes.)</p>

<p>Some of the chaps were good at one or two operations of the
work, but generally failed to produce a well finished article;
e.g., one would be good at construction, another at cutting out,
and another at embossing. Perceiving that a division of labour and
co-operation would lead to better results, Ted formed a
company&mdash;or, rather, employed his fellow-inmates on piece-work
and commission&mdash;which gave increased earnings, a better
article and all-round satis faction.</p>

<p>All the money Ted derived from this occupation was not, however,
used for purchasing dope. A definite weekly amount went to
liquidate the obligations of a deceased cobber; this was perhaps
the only redeeming feature of the time, and provided Ted in later
years with the satisfaction of knowing that he had at least done
one thing worth while. The balance was spent freely, in between
surgical operations, in having and giving a good time, with little
or no thought of the morrow or the consequences. Most wounded
Diggers passed through this reactionary period and had recourse to
drink, which delayed the healing of wounds, but gave some respite
to their war-tortured minds. The majority survived, some even
returning to their pre-war standards; but, of the more seriously
wounded, and particularly those addicted to drugs, many were taken
in death or insanity before a few years had passed.</p>

<p>Among the Randwick Remnants there was Sandy, a spine case, and
Johnny, with one leg amputated and the other gangrenous beyond
possibility of amputation. Transferred to the Coast Hospital
against their wish, on the morning after their arrival they asked
to be lifted into their wheel-chairs which they propelled some
seven miles to a well-known hotel at Paddington. After refreshing
themselves to the limit of their financial resources, they pulled
themselves out of their chairs and hired them to children for a
penny a ride. When eventually found they were in a shocking state
and had to be rushed off in an ambulance, to Randwick Hospital.
Sandy led a wild and woolly life for many years, but in the end
settled down quietly, and when last heard of was one of the few
spine cases who, never able to walk from the day of his affliction,
survived more than ten years after the war. Johnny never used his
wheel-chair again, but he rallied sufficiently to take up suede
leatherwork, which he carried on to within a day of his death some
few months later. "You know," he remarked on one occasion, "they
reckon cotton-wool will kill you. Well, I've swallowed rolls and
rolls of it, but it's no damn good."</p>

<p>Within a few hours of his death he said to Ted, who had gone
across to him to borrow a leather punch: "Take the whole kit, Muss,
I won't want it any more, I'm snuffing out to-day."</p>

<p>"You'll be all right, Johnny; buck up."</p>

<p>"Too true, here pull this cork," but he died before the flask of
whisky was finished.</p>

<p>There were others. Sapper H., another spine case, the first
totally incapacitated Digger to return from Gallipoli, who rebuked
a certain A.M.C. colonel who addressed him by his surname. "Sir!"
he said, "my rank was sapper, the equivalent of colonel in the
A.M.C. In future, kindly address me by my rank." Sapper survived
until about 1927, but not long enough to enjoy an outing in the car
that was then being specially constructed to take his bed. A good
fellow, Sapper&mdash;one of the quiet ones. Then there was Bluey
R., a ginger-haired youth with a bullet embedded in the spine. He
was one of the cheerful wonders who, despite his affliction and
dropped feet, managed with the aid of surgical boots and two
walking sticks to get about a little. The most striking
characteristic of Blue was his smile and ready wit. "Do you know
who I am?" said a well known visiting chattering comedienne. "Yes,
Mrs Pankhurst," was Blue's ready reply, and the colonel had to turn
his head to cough. When last heard of, Blue was about to undergo an
operation to his tonsils; he and his smile are probably on deck
to-day. A similar case, Tom D., one of the most respected and
likeable of chaps, silently endured his troubles and gave wise
council to his maimed fellow-men until he too was called west.
Arthur C. and Paddy B., two other spine cases, early went the way
of their cobbers, both stout fellows unto the end.</p>

<p>Jimmy K., another spine, blown up in France, had returned home
and been discharged "fit," and had gone to work in the bush until
his trouble developed, thereafter living in a plaster jacket until
he, too, crossed the divide in 1932. Another good fellow was Jim,
S.P. by occupation and curried lobster and stout by inclination.
Frank C., suffering the same disability&mdash;is he aboard to-day?
What-o his motor cycle and side-car from which he drove more often
than not, with a Digger cobber sitting on the carrier. On one
occasion he had a wonderful trip to the mountains&mdash;an orderly,
invited to the party, that evening put a hot water-bottle minus its
camisole at Frank's feet. In consequence the flesh was burnt off
the heel of one foot, but Frank, who enjoyed every minute of his
holiday, did not feel it. Another time his cycle struck a culvert
and he was thrown over a fence into a garden where he lay laughing
and unable to move, while the lady of the house abused him for
breaking down her plants.</p>

<p>Of the other patients was Taffey O., who lost a trotter. While
the leg was healing he attended a motor mechanics' school in the
city. The first day he went to "work" the boys cut his lunch,
sticking-plaster sandwiches and apples soaked in metho., and when
he came "home" his bed was decorated like a motor car. However, he
learnt to drive&mdash;a lift. Then there were Roasty and Mass, but
they show up later, at Prince Alfred Hospital. Not so Bill E., who
remained at Randwick, where the shell-hole in his hip was the
subject of many performances at the theatre.</p>

<p>Bill E. and Muscles were under Sir Herbert &mdash;&mdash;, whom
they met almost weekly at the theatre. Sister E. liked to tell how
Sir Herbert used to talk during the operation, when Muss was under
the anaesthetic. "You poor little &mdash;&mdash;, I'll fix you up,
the German &mdash;&mdash;s."</p>

<p>The day he operated on Bill with the aid of a local anaesthetic
and spots of whisky (for Bill, of course) was the climax that
brought his personal interest in Muscles to an end. Muscles was
lying in the anaesthetizing room, but, getting tired of the hard
slab, got up and peered through the unshut sliding doors leading
into the theatre while Bill's turn was in progress. Sir Herbert
called for a stool, but as he went to sit down the top came off and
he sat on the cement floor. Calling the orderly all kinds of a
blanky-blank-blank, he turned round to see who was laughing and
spied Muss, whose head was almost through the doors, laughing the
more at the surgeon's masked and horn-rimmed spectacled face.</p>

<p>"What the Hell are you doing there?"</p>

<p>"Waiting my turn, sir. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Does not appear to be much wrong with you, you &mdash;&mdash;,"
but the orderly drew the doors together and Muscles got back on to
the table.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Sir Herbert came into the room, dressed ready
to leave.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't do you to-day, lad," he said pinching Ted's
cheek.</p>

<p>"That's no good to me, I've been prepared, it's not a fair
go."</p>

<p>"Well! what are you going to do about it?" said Sir Herbert,
looking down at Ted with a smile.</p>

<p>"How about your off-sider having a cut at it?" Sir Herbert's
face changed. Ted realized that he had said the wrong thing, but it
was too late to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Very well, F&mdash;&mdash;," he said, addressing the doctor and
giving some instruction in technical terms that may have meant
"chop his head off" for all Ted knew. "Good afternoon."</p>

<p>Ted had little time to think further as Dr E. gave him closed
ether, and this happened to be one of the few occasions on which he
did not talk while going off. The operation was a success, and was
the means of adding some more dead bone to the collection.</p>

<p>Two days later Ted got into trouble. With the exception of the
sister in charge, all the nurses in his ward were angels. Patients
unable to go to the recreation hall for morning tea were allowed to
have it in the ward, but the orderly made the mistake of not asking
the sister if Ted was one of these and brought him a mug of
tea.</p>

<p>"Who told you he can have tea here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He can't get up," the orderly started to explain. "I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not here to think; take the tea away!" Then, to Ted,
"What are you getting up for? I'll ring the doctor."</p>

<p>"Do. I'm going over to the shop to buy my damned tea," said Ted.
He did so and, on his return, found the doctor awaiting him.</p>

<p>"What's this I hear?" demanded the M.O.</p>

<p>"What you see. I've been refused tea; if I'm not sick enough to
have it in bed, I'm well enough to go and get it, that's me," was
Ted's logic.</p>

<p>The sister explained that he could have had tea, but the orderly
had no right to give it to a patient without first asking her
permission. Just a detail&mdash;but most upsetting at the time.
Some women should never have taken up nursing, yet in the
experience of years this one was only the third who had behaved in
this fashion. Another of this trio was a sister who threw a little
dog over the balcony to the ground some twenty feet below. Her
explanation of this act of cruelty, for it was nothing less, was
that she thought it would "land on its feet like a cat!" The troops
insisted on her being relieved&mdash;she was. As to all the
others&mdash;well, they were wonderful.</p>

<p>"Shrapnel Kate," the night super., was probably the most talked
of sister of the time. She knew every patient in the hospital, his
medical history, his mode of spending leave, and the time as well
as the manner in which he would return. It was said that she waited
in a fig-tree to watch for the boys coming in after hours, but,
whether this is true or not, the fact remains that she invariably
arrived at a man's bedside within a minute or two of his return.
Once Ted thought he had scored a victory over her, but he was sadly
mistaken. After getting into bed fully dressed and turning on the
snores, and having apparently satisfied her inspection under the
rays of a torch, he was caught three minutes later getting
undressed as she doubled back to make doubly sure. When a chap was
really ill, he could not have wished for better and more devoted
attention than she gave, but, immediately he was well enough to sit
up and take notice, she dropped him like a hot brick.</p>

<p>Different sisters had different methods. Sister C., who has
never been known to report a man for any delinquency, could get the
Diggers to do anything she wished. Few will forget the "new guard"
incident&mdash;when military policemen were substituted for a
dinkum Digger guard. In the battle that ensued between the patients
and the police, Sister C. entered the fray in the midst of flying
bottles and swinging crutches, and with a word here and there,
asking and not ordering, she succeeded in withdrawing her boys from
the scene of action. The "jacks" fled in all directions, and were
never again detailed to stand guard over the inmates of Randwick
Hospital.</p>

<p>After this affair, however, the military police gave patients on
leave little mercy. Returning to the hospital one night Ted saw a
one-legged Digger with his back to the ramp at the Central Railway
Station and two "jacks" asking to see his pass. He had one, but
would not produce it, and when Ted butted into the argument a
whistle brought four other "jacks" into the picture. Ted could give
no more than moral support to the "peggy," who used his crutches to
good effect until they were both arrested. The following morning
they were brought before the colonel, on charges of resisting
arrest and being A.W.L. Satisfied at seeing four out of the six
policemen's heads bandaged, they pleaded guilty to the former
charge.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say it took six able men to arrest these
cripples?" roared the colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind your buts, you should be damned well ashamed of
yourselves. Next case, S.M., this one's dismissed."</p>

<p>At the time of the conscription campaigns, returned soldiers,
many of them disabled, came in for much humiliating abuse from
those who preferred to keep the home fires burning. That is
probably why the patients at Randwick Hospital recorded a vote in
favour of compulsory service. From the windows of the operation
block one day, three civilians were seen to attack two
Diggers&mdash;one a "wingy," the other a "peggy." In less time than
it takes to tell, a number of pyjama-clad patients went to their
rescue, and though they had little success, the civilian police
rounded up two of the assailants who received nothing more than a
fine.</p>

<p>About this time, Bill E. and Muscles attended the operating
theatre practically every Friday. For a day or two following an
operation they would be kept in the ward and then take up veranda
beds pending the next operation. One day, upon their return from
the theatre, a new sister made the mistake' of putting them in
adjoining beds, and both coming to at the same time they indulged
in abuse of each other to the limits of their vocabularies. Bill
was a bullock driver, so the sister fled. After throwing an iron
chair at Muscles, Bill got out of bed, rolled up his mattress and
bedding, and, wishing Muss a soldier's farewell, struggled out on
his gammy leg to his veranda bed. Ted dressed and went home, but on
the following morning he remembered nothing of the affair or even
as to how he arrived there. The sister was of course blamed for
this, so on the following Friday she took the precaution of tying
them down in bed after their return from the theatre.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, two days after this operation, Ted was
visited by his father, bringing news of the death in France of
another cousin whose brother had been killed there three weeks
previously. Not having forwarded a letter of condolence to his
uncle in Victoria, on the former occasion, Ted felt that he could
hardly write to him now. He turned the matter over in his mind and,
after his father had gone, made his decision.</p>

<p>"Got any money, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Lend me a fiver?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what for?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to Melbourne."</p>

<p>The doctor was brought, and, when Ted had signed a statement to
the effect that he was leaving at his own risk, the sister packed
some dressings for him and away he went. In Melbourne he met and
condoled with his uncle and other relatives, and returned to
Randwick on the following Wednesday in time to have a rest and
prepare for yet another "hop-over" on the Friday.</p>

<p>Some weeks later at his own request Ted became an out-patient,
and during the six weeks that followed he made his first effort to
give up drugs and return to civilian life. Securing a messenger's
job with a patriotic firm in the city, he was allowed time off to
attend the hospital for dressings. When there were no messages to
be run, he was sent to the "Soldiers' Welcome" hall at St Andrew's
Cathedral, there to play billiards and otherwise enjoy himself
until sent for. The job was a charitable one and, had his health
improved, it might have been the means of saving him from the mania
of taking drugs; but another operation becoming necessary, he had
to return to hospital, and thence forward he gradually went down
hill. Doing less and less leatherwork, playing poker and seldom
bothering to take leave or to go to the many free entertainments
and outings arranged for the patients, he became worse in mind and
general health, until all interest in his fellows or his
surroundings vanished. His visitors did not understand, and became
fewer, but as he just wanted to be alone, he did not care, and so
the time came when, with many other chronic patients, he was booked
for transfer to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII. DOPE</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Prince Alfred
Hospital&mdash;Work and play&mdash;The Rev. Roasty&mdash;Now the
bleedin' war is over&mdash;The strangling tentacles of
morphia&mdash;The flame of youth.</p>

<p class="cp">(1918-1919)</p>

<hr>

<p>A change from one place to another, whether welcome or not, was
always marked by some form of hilarity. The move to the Prince
Alfred was no exception. About one hundred cases were transferred
thither and accommodated in three new wards&mdash;known as the
Albert Pavilion. The usual motor-ambulance transport was provided,
and the car in which Ted, four other sitting patients, and one cot
case made the trip, conveniently broke down on the way. While the
driver was effecting repairs, the troops sheltered in a corner
house and, ere the ambulance was again in running order, the house
might have been the old <i>estaminet</i> for all the Diggers cared
of impending events. A merrier ambulance complement probably never
drew up to the sombre portal of the Prince Alfred or any other
hospital. Heralding their arrival with much singing, they were
given a rousing welcome by their advance guard, which waved and
shouted greetings from the numerous windows of the three floors
overlooking the entrance drive. A cool reception by the hospital
superintendent followed. The young nurses, who received them with
awe, must have thought this consignment, at least, had been
diverted from the Callan Park Mental Hospital.</p>

<p>The troops considered the civilian method of admission to
hospital an unnecessary joke. Ted was ordered to bed&mdash;the
nurse said he was very sick. He saw her write down pulse 140,
temperature 103.2; the pulse may have been correct, but the
temperature reading was doubtless increased when he dipped the
thermometer into a mug of tea. The hospital's regulation
pink-and-white check shirts were issued instead of pyjamas. The
shirts were very short, designed possibly in the interests of
economy or, more probably, with the idea of forcing patients to
remain in bed. Complaints regarding the shirts, the smoking
regulations, the cuisine, the students' desire to inspect patients,
the all-important question of leave, and sundry other differences,
from military hospital routine to which they had been used, would
be considered in due course, but in the meantime they had to accept
the conditions or get out.</p>

<p>At one end of Ward A2 a protest meeting was in progress, while
at the other end two patients, clad in their issue shirts and
standing on a bed, were doing their best to render a Punch and Judy
show above the screen surrounding it. Ted was contriving to remove
his trousers under the bed clothes, there being no other screen
available, when Ray P. enquired: "What's up, Muss? Don't go to bed,
come over the road and I'll introduce you to Mrs&mdash;, who keeps
the best beer in Sydney, drawn through glass tubes. Come on." But
just then a doctor arrived to take down Ted's medical history,
carry out a long examination, and order treatment and diet, and,
before he had finished, Mrs&mdash;had closed down her establishment
for the night.</p>

<p>Quite a number of the boys formed a great attachment for Mrs
&mdash;&mdash; and her daughter, both of whom took more than a
business interest in their new-found clientele and would not allow
its members to have one over the proverbial "eight." Though Mr
&mdash;&mdash; was not so popular&mdash;for he showed little
inclination to learn the art of writing on a slate&mdash;he
nevertheless had a few admirers who, clad in dressing gowns, were
always there to wish him good morning when he opened his doors at 6
a.m.</p>

<p>But, to return to the hospital on admission day, the final scene
of jollification was staged after the lights went out at 8 o'clock.
The troops, clad only in their pink-and-white shirts&mdash;Long
Mass, the leader, also wore huge cardboard spurs&mdash;formed into
single file and moved off on a grand parade. At the head of the
column was Roasty, carrying a portable gramophone, on which was
being played a march record. The nurses laughed and squealed at the
sight. Another act, a solo cancan by Roasty on the marble-top
dressing table, was being well rendered when the night super.
arrived, and the curtain was rung down to the music of the snoring
chorus.</p>

<p>The troops, however, were not destined to have all their own
way. They could not put it over the superintendent, who was a
returned soldier; and the sister-in-charge, "Camperdown Lizz," had
also seen service on the other side. A few unbridled cases were
returned to Randwick on the following day; the remainder were told
in no uncertain terms where they stood and where they got off, and
as the novelty of the new regulations and surroundings wore off
there was a general settling down to more moderate behaviour.</p>

<p>Like any other person in authority, the hospital superintendent
was disliked. Had not these men voluntarily risked their lives for
their country? Had not they experienced their fill of authority?
Were they not now discharged from the army? Could they not do as
they liked with what was left of their lives? Were they not
promised that they would never want for anything? Granted, but they
must learn that their return to the field of civilian life was not
to be as green as they had visualized it from "over there." In
fact, they would find that the thorns and nettles had increased
during their absence. So there was much to be realized and endured.
The rules and regulations of this institution had been drawn up
over a number of years in the interests of suffering humanity. The
war had not altered this, except to add one hundred of its
sufferers to the care of the hospital&mdash;humanity would continue
to suffer&mdash;the rules must go on. Whereas in the army an
indiscretion could be expiated by red-ink entries in a man's
pay-book, and he be free to carry on more or less as usual, the
position was now reversed.</p>

<p>An offender here was not court-martialled or reprimanded, and
financially reduced; he was merely shown to the door and given the
freedom of the cold, cold world. Thus was the first lesson learnt
at the P.A., and it must be admitted that the super. was both
tolerant and just. He possibly made some mistakes. On the other
hand, it may be argued that his actions were in the interests of
his job or of the hospital; nevertheless the fact remains that his
disciplinary measures were the foundation on which surgical,
medical, and nursing treatment rebuilt these shattered minds and
bodies, and in most cases their owners ultimately became useful
members of society.</p>

<p>This happy state was not achieved overnight; in some cases it
took years. Sympathy, though well meant and possibly deserved, on
the part of certain doctors and, almost without exception, of the
nursing staff, was one of the factors that tended to prolong the
period of return to a normal frame of mind. Doctors and nurses
shielded the men in many of their oversteppings, often at grave
risk to their own professional interests and connection with the
hospital. The case of X might be taken as an example. Very drunk,
he decided forthwith to leave the hospital of his own accord
instead of waiting to be thrown out on the morrow. Doctor and
sister pleaded with him to stay. Refusing to accept their assurance
that they would not report his conduct, he was nevertheless
persuaded to drink a draught before leaving. It was paraldehyde,
and rendered him unconscious before he reached the door. They
undressed and put him to bed. The only report against his name in
the book was: Day report, "not complaining;" night report,
"sleeping well." That act might have checked the downward path of
some men, but in X's case it was not until he learnt the super's
lesson that his mode of life changed for the better.</p>

<p>The treatment and appointments in the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital were second to none. The necessarily strict rules and the
limited resources of such a large public institution were modified
to suit the convenience of the soldier patients and, every
reasonable concession and comfort were accorded them. The Red Cross
Society established a depot from which it distributed many
comforts, superintended hospital handicrafts, and supplied special
foods for those more seriously ill. The Australian Jockey Club
built and furnished a most comfortable recreation hall where
concert parties frequently entertained the troops. Another
innovation was the provision of a dining room and a card room in
each ward, while the cleanliness and orderliness of the whole place
were decided improvements on the makeshift conditions obtaining at
Randwick.</p>

<p>It was a characteristic of the Digger that he quickly adapted
himself to changed conditions and surroundings. On the morning
following admission to the R.P.A., many of these men resumed their
various hospital avocations. Leatherwork and basketwork were the
principal trades; needlework held a few, and one man, who had
undertaken to make his fiance's trousseau, was already absorbed in
the intricacies of some flimsy scalloped garment. Others made
themselves useful at various ward duties, sweeping, dusting,
polishing, washing up, attending the wants of bed patients, etc.
Bed patients rolled bandages and made up various cotton-wool, lint,
and gauze articles for the dressing bundles. To all intents and
purposes, they might have been born in the institution.</p>

<p>The matron, however, found much to displease her when she did
her rounds that morning. What annoyed her most of all was the state
of Ted's locker, over the white enamel surface of which he had
spilt a bottle of red leather stain; and she looked furious when
the chap in the next bed said, "That's nothing, Matron, you should
see the locker Muscles left at Randwick, it was bloody awful."</p>

<p>While the recreation hall was in course of construction Roasty
and Muscles formed a cricket club. The club had a very humble
beginning but soon passed from the
picket-off-the-fence-and-soft-ball stage to become a regular club
with two teams and a first-grade kit of gear. At first there was
some trouble with the groundsman of the University Oval on account
of the players' wheel-chairs and crutches digging up the regular
wicket, but he compromised by preparing another pitch and the games
went on. Few of the boys proved to be all-rounders. Those on
crutches could bat but were not of much use in the field. Titch
made an excellent wicket-keeper in his wheel-chair until the
misjudging of a swinging bat sent him back to bed. The champion
bowler, Snow, whose left arm was held high in a shoulder splint,
had a most deceptive action. Muscles went from first emergency to
vice-captain in one stride, but the first stroke of the bat sent
him a "sixer" and he woke up in bed. The cricket casualties
continued to mount until the super. drew up another rule forbidding
inmates to participate in active outdoor team games.</p>

<p>Boxing was the next form of recreation that was given a trial,
but the knockout that Bill Bot. gave to Roasty caused the official
seal of disapproval to be placed on it also. Roasty, of the stiff
leg and disabled arm, thereafter directed his athletic inclinations
to the iron bar overhanging his bed on which he performed all
manner of hair-raising gymnastic feats.</p>

<p>One day Roasty, assisted by a Digger organist and another known
as "The Urger," conducted a service in the hospital chapel. Quite a
number of civilian patients were attracted by the singing, and The
Urger rounded up a number of stray sheep. The congregation quickly
divided into two, the civilian side singing "The Church's One
Foundation" and the Digger side "We are a Rag-time Army"
simultaneously to that well-known tune. The Rag-time Army won but
there was no retreat for the Civvies, The Urger having posted a
guard on the door. Roasty, with collar in reverse, eyes peering
over spectacles, and hands piously clasped, looked quote the part
as he announced:</p>

<p>"This being the first day of lent, seven days following the last
day of manna, and seven days prior to the next, for the day of
pension falleth only every fourteenth day, I find that I and my
flock hath sadly strayed on to the rocks where manna falleth not
and all that was has been lent and borrowed among us until there
remaineth nothing. Blessed is he who hath given all he had for he
shalt not be robbed. Ye who are of my flock are very fortunate. Ye
who are not of my flock shall be equally fortunate, for verily I
say unto you that you shall be fleeced forthwith. Wowser Wingy
shall now take up the collection. Cast freely of your deeners,
zacs, trays, and coppers into his hat, for he hath but one arm and
shall accounteth to me for every penny. He who heedeth not shall be
in danger of having his pocket picked. The flock shall now
sing:</p>

<p class="poem">"We lost disasters in Egypt,<br>
In France we lost by the score;<br>
Bradburys in Blighty left us,<br>
And army pay's no more.<br>
We have to make this collection,<br>
It's your turn for sacrifice;<br>
Cough up your oscar,<br>
We'll call you a boscar,<br>
For that is our price."<br></p>

<p>Later Roasty continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The proceeds of the collection, two shillings and four pence,
ain't 'arf enough to 'elp us to 'otel 'ospitality, so I place it in
this mission box for the 'eartless, 'elpless, 'opeless 'eathens.
One verse of the old words and three of the new shall now conclude
the service:</p>

<p class="poem">When this bleedin' war is over,<br>
Oh, how happy I shall be;<br>
When I get my civvie clothes on,<br>
No more soldiering for me.<br>
<br>
Now the bleedin' war is over,<br>
Oh, how happy was I there;<br>
Now old Fritz and I have parted,<br>
Life's one everlasting care.<br>
<br>
No more <i>estaminets</i> to sing in,<br>
No ma'moiselles to make me gay;<br>
Civvie life's a bleedin' failure,<br>
I was happy yesterday.<br>
<br>
Now I've got my civvie clothes on,<br>
Oh, how happy I shall be;<br>
When I get my devil's tail on,<br>
No more civvie life for me.<br>
Only one more operation,<br>
Only one more pension day;<br>
Ere I hop across the sand-bags,<br>
Where old soldiers fade away.<br>
<br>
When in Hell I join my cobbers,<br>
Oh, how happy I shall be;<br>
Heaping coals upon the blighters<br>
Who have dished it out to me.<br>
Feeding brimstone to the Kaiser,<br>
Oh, how happy I shall be;<br>
When the War Lords get their issue,<br>
No more hell on earth for me."</p>

<p>Time went on. Patients were patched up, discharged, re-admitted,
patched up, and discharged again. Old wounds had a nasty habit of
breaking down. One never felt that a cobber receiving his discharge
was going for good; he was expected back some day, unless of course
he went via the morgue.</p>

<p>The send off arranged in honour of Ray P.'s departure could not
be held in a hotel, on account of the restrictions introduced
during the influenza epidemic. In the end the function took place
in the superintendent's garage at the rear of the hospital, and was
a complete success. The car was wheeled out into the rain, and as
the evening progressed the songs and laughter increased in volume
until close on midnight, when the words of "Auld Lang Syne,"
perhaps uttered a little thickly, were audible to the cot cases
half a mile away.</p>

<p>All departures were not happy ones. For example, there was the
case of Y&mdash;&mdash;, who drank a bottle of methylated spirit,
cut his throat and an artery in his arm, and jumped out the window
to the ground fifty feet below. The severed artery proved fatal.
There were other distressing and tragic cases, yet amidst all the
horror and suffering the cheerful spirit of the Digger prevailed
and usually won out.</p>

<p>Two years after discharge from the army found Ted still in
Prince Alfred Hospital. He had become a slave to the drug habit. It
is true that during the last few months he had, in between
operations, been able to do a little leatherwork and take part in
some of the jollifications. But his retirement from the cricket
club marked the end of his active interest in anything but drugs.
So severe was pain he had to bear and so accustomed was he to drugs
that ten grains of morphia, forty times the usual dose, failed to
have the desired effect. Because the medical treatment included
morphia, his own secret taking of it had, as yet, not been found
out. It was not until some weeks after his 48th operation that he
was discovered to be an almost hopeless victim.</p>

<p>This operation&mdash;for the removal of sharp spurs of bone
which had grown from the ends of the fractured ribs, and of a large
growth of nerves&mdash;was a success, but the severe haemorrhage
and reaction that followed almost proved fatal. It was only the
untiring care and skilful attention of the doctors and nursing
staff, and the personal rather than the professional interest of Dr
H., that made it possible for Ted to fight for life in the weeks
following the operation and to survive.</p>

<p>Dr H. was not his doctor. Her day duties were in another
department of the hospital, but at any time of the night that he
wanted her she would come. More than once she watched over him the
whole night through. It was her devotion and understanding, her
words of warning against drugs, and her appeals to his better
instincts that eventually penetrated his drugged and pain-warped
mind and made him resolve to live. He would cast off the strangling
tentacles of that vile clinging monster which had all but sapped
him morally and had left him void of anything else in life other
than to sleep and dream, crave and rave, and sleep again.</p>

<p>She set him a task&mdash;how difficult only the hell of its
accomplishment, how great only absolute victory, would know. He had
received his last injection of morphia, had heard her parting
message&mdash;"One should not be proud of never falling, but be
proud to fall and rise again"&mdash;and had promised to climb, when
the superintendent, as though overhearing everything, appeared at
the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"I know your complaint," he said. "You are a drug addict."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you want to get better?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll see you in the morning."</p>

<p>Complete isolation from the military wards was the first thing
the super. prescribed. But Ted refused to leave the company of the
troops. Accepting the super's alternative, he left the hospital a
trembling wreck, craving for dope yet resolved to fight and resist
it&mdash;on his own. He collapsed at the gate, and a lady doctor
and Roasty half-carried him back to the ward. The superintendent
would not relent to the pleadings of other doctors and
sisters&mdash;Ted had either to accept his treatment or get out.
Exhausted, broken, and feeling the weight of degradation heavily
upon him, the youth was taken to his isolation where only the
superintendent and a special nurse were allowed to attend him.</p>

<p>Isolation, however, did not prevent him from securing drugs. The
cunning of a dope fiend is almost impossible to combat. He
completely loses sight of the fact that something is being done for
his own good, feeling instead that the whole world is contriving to
torture him. And so he plans for future supplies and will do
anything to secure delivery, all the devils ever named prompting
him to gain his objective. Even if he harbours any thought of
wanting to be cured, he craves possession of the drug just the
same, deceiving himself into the belief that he will not take any.
He just wants it&mdash;just in case&mdash;and once procured he
schemes first to secrete it, and then to avoid observation of his
taking it. In fact he almost brings himself to believe that he is
not taking it, or, at least, is weaning himself so long as he
avoids discovery, but all the time he is going from bad to worse,
his mind being unable to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>Even close scrutiny of his mail, parcels, and laundry failed to
prevent Ted from securing a large consignment. Both the nurse and
he received a box of chocolates, apparently identical&mdash;Ted's
contained the dope. That night he experienced, perhaps the worst
horror of his life. He would just have one, only one little tablet,
a quarter grain, that could not hurt, it would help a little, just
one but no more. Oh no! he would never want it again, only this
once and then he would be all right. It would give him sleep, rest,
and strength. Strength? Strength of what? No, he was strong enough
to chuck the vile stuff away, but no, not now&mdash;to-morrow. One,
just one. No, he would take two, for the pain was very bad; all the
pains he had ever suffered were racking his body, and no man could
stand such pain. H. would forgive him this once. She would not
know; perhaps she had forgotten him, but perhaps not&mdash;had she
not that day sent him a book, <i>Myths of Greece and Rome?</i>
Fancy reading a book! Would he ever be able to do that again? Just
one tablet and he would be able to read. But would he? No, he would
be thinking of his deception. Oh God! what had he done to deserve
this hell? He would end it all&mdash;forever&mdash;he would go
now&mdash;but why not one or two? It would make it easier, ah! He
would take an overdose. Again he fondled the box, his chin sagged
and trembled, his hand clutched at his parched throat, his eyes
stared into nothingness&mdash;the nothingness of beyond&mdash;faces
of those who had gone before, faces of those living whose lives had
been much to him, passed before his vision...A gleam of light! What
was that? Thee night sister coming on her rounds. She must not see
the box&mdash;she did not, but was quick to notice his
distress.</p>

<p>"Why, Muscles, you are not about to-night?" (He did not sleep at
night&mdash;just walked up and down the space of veranda allotted
for his isolation.) "And you have not slept to-day. You refused
your treatment and food, just when you were getting on so well.
Come, there's a good chappie, take this bromide and tablets, and
lie down for a little while. You may sleep. I'll come back."</p>

<p>She went on her rounds. Ted took the tablets from under his
tongue, crushed them underfoot, and spat out in disgust. Why, she
was treating him like a child. He would show her, he would show
them all what he was. He would get rid of the dope for a start.
Yes, he would put it down the surgical sink at the end of the
veranda. He went there, failed once more&mdash;passed through it
all again...and so on through the night.</p>

<p>It was not until the grey dawn that in one great effort he
brought himself, with all the strength that his weakened body and
mind could muster, to carry out his resolve. As the drugs
disappeared down the sink the reaction of the night overtook him,
and there he was found in an unconscious heap. But he had won his
first great fight.</p>

<p>There were other tussles&mdash;the following night was almost as
bad&mdash;and it was six months before Ted could lie down at night
without feeling the craving for morphia. The ascent was long and
perilous. To slip the least little bit or relax for a moment meant
falling headlong into the depths again. Gradually the way cleared,
and gradually he was given more latitude. At night time he would
occupy himself by helping in the ward, where much assistance was
needed. The 'flu epidemic was taking its toll at an increasing
rate, and the hospital staff was almost worn out. Ted turned his
hospital experience to practical use, and was able to lend a hand
at anything from carrying a bottle to laying out a corpse. The
night he assisted the wardsman to transfer three bodies to the
morgue, prompted him to volunteer officially for 'flu work on the
morrow. But the super. would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"If you get the 'flu, you will go out like that," he said,
snapping his fingers. "Once I thought you better dead, but now you
have broken yourself of the drug habit I am going to allow you to
go home. Mind now, it will be a long time before you lose your
craving altogether. Stick to it, son, the worst is over. I
congratulate you and am more proud than I can say. Put it
here."</p>

<p>That little speech and shake of the hand had been worth fighting
for.</p>

<p>And so Ted, yet a boy of but twenty summers went home. Despite
the years of suffering and the hell through which he had passed,
the flame of youth that had so many times almost burnt out was
still there&mdash;a little dull, and flickering somewhat&mdash;but
there nevertheless. Within a few weeks it had kindled the fire of
ambition, and in the bright glow that radiated from the flames he
pictured the future&mdash;successful occupation, a home of his
own...There was much to live and strive for, life was sweet. He
planned and set to work accordingly.</p>

<p class="cp">(1919-1935)</p>

<hr>

<p>The change over from the soldiering to the civilian order was
not just a matter of getting out of a uniform and selecting a dress
to suit one's individual fancy&mdash;it was not as simple as that.
Even those who were fortunate enough to return whole in body found
it more difficult to establish themselves in peace than it had been
to find their place in war. Mostly young men, their lives had been
moulded, cast, and set to the standardized pattern required by the
immense and heartless machinery of war. Their lives had now to be
thrown into the melting pot. The very substance of their being had
to undergo a complete change if they were to fit into the subtle
ramifications of "Peace on earth, good will toward men." The
outlook on life and the values had to be recast. Individual
responsibility to one's self had to take the place of submission to
authority. Necessity became the order of the day.</p>

<p>Those who had suffered loss of physical fitness found it even
more difficult to readapt themselves. The labourer who had lost a
leg or an arm could not now take up a profession; the professional
man or student who had suffered shell-shock must find it difficult
to adapt himself to some menial occupation, and so on. The
Repatriation Department did much to train and place disabled
soldiers in work, but, generally speaking, the problem was one for
the individual himself to solve.</p>

<p>For Ted, art leatherwork, a correspondence course in
book-keeping and business training, a few pens of poultry, and many
hives of bees served to occupy him, and within a few months the
craving for drugs was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The open wound in his stiff and useless right arm continued to
cause trouble, while the wounds of the mind occasioned periods of
restlessness and remorse. But a day out with a few old cobbers,
some beer, singing old songs, reviewing the more pleasant of old
memories, and perhaps finishing up in an argument with the
proprietor of some foreign fish-shop, afforded an opportunity for
letting off steam. There had to be some safety-valve for his
pent-up feelings. Dynamiting fish for the edification of old school
pals, a trip to Victoria with some schoolboy footballers, and a
holiday in the Newcastle district with cobbers of the old
battalion, were other diversions which helped him along the
way.</p>

<p>With the establishment of a studio in George street, came two
first prizes for art leatherwork in the Adelaide Peace Exhibition,
an order for diary covers from Lady Birdwood, and two orders for
presentation writing-cases for the Prince of Wales. While he was
engaged on the orders for the Prince the condition of the arm
became so seriously affected that it had to be amputated. This
operation, the 49th, was borne without recourse to morphia, and on
Sunday, 20 June 1920, his twenty-first birthday, Ted was taken from
Prince Alfred Hospital to Randwick to make the presentation on
behalf of the Red Cross to the Prince.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards another operation was performed for the
removal of nerve bulbs, and towards the end of 1920 Ted became a
clerk in a manufacturing company. Optimistically believing himself
to be established in civilian life and feeling that the future was
assured, he married. But within five years, after progressing
through the general accounting department to the post of employment
manager, the necessity arose for another operation, and subsequent
ill-health forced him to relinquish this employment.</p>

<p>Although he prayed that morphia be not given him, his condition
following this operation was such that injection of the drug became
absolutely necessary, and again he went through the hell of 1919.
Diagnosed as a hopeless drug addict, it was his good fortune to
have a few believing friends, and Dr C., the former superintendent,
again came to his aid. The evil thing was again conquered and the
fight for a place in the sun once more taken up.</p>

<p>For some time previous to this operation, Ted had been actively
engaged in organizing returned soldiers' clubs and associations,
and he was directly responsible for placing hundreds of returned
men in employment. Continuation of this work in the interest of his
fellow Diggers kept him fully occupied until, with a return to
better health, he decided to make another attempt to establish
himself in business.</p>

<p>The first venture, in partnership with his old cobber Rex, did
not develop according to the prospectus drawn up by the go-getting
company promoters from whom they purchased shares and acquired
certain rights; but a side-line, manufacturing and retailing
gramophones, offset some of the losses. Casual employment with Rex
in his estate agency business and attending to the incubators,
brooders, and pens of their "model breeding" poultry farm, served
to pass the time until in 1928 he entered the Royal North Shore
Hospital for his 52nd operation, a "domestic" one this time, not
due to war service.</p>

<p>At the North Shore Hospital the doctor, a Digger, got writer's
cramp after wading about half-way through Ted's medical history,
and suggested an adjournment to the bathroom, where they might
indulge in a smoke and finish off the job in reasonable comfort.
When he had written the last word and noted the request "no
morphia," the doctor asked: "What have you come here for?"</p>

<p>"Appendix," replied Ted.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that, but you've had some of the best doctors in
the world on your case, and now you come here to let the mugs have
a cut at you. No, not exactly mugs, but by comparison&mdash;well,
you know. Hugh P. or Professor S. would only be too glad to fix you
up. Think it over. I'll see you in the morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, Doc., I've got piles. Could you fix that up,
too, under the same anaesthetic?"<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>An accountancy practice was Ted's next venture, which reached
the stage when he considered it sufficiently established and
remunerative to justify his purchasing a car. As a side-line he
founded an art woodworking business. Not long afterwards, however,
the financial depression threw spanners into the works and he sold
out.</p>

<p>When, in the ensuing upheaval, it became the fashion to join
some political organization or other, he threw the whole of his
energy into a brand new one that had as its object the saving of
Australia from the evils of party politics. Within a few months the
membership of this organization went to over 100,000, and during
the same period Ted rose from the position of district committeeman
to that of State Councillor and executive officer.</p>

<p>But a year's experience in the political arena was sufficient to
convince Ted that in the peace-time ways of men he had much to
learn, so he resigned from his party and thereupon spent a holiday
at the Limbless Soldiers' Aquatic Club.</p>

<p>The Limbless Soldiers' Aquatic Club&mdash;which provides
comfort, accommodation, and recreational facilities, such as a
swimming bath, a bowling green, billiards, and boating&mdash;is an
example of the enterprise of the Limbless Soldiers' Association of
New South Wales, which has received much public support.</p>

<p>The club's rowing boat with outboard motor was perhaps the
feature that appealed mostly to Ted. In it he had a few exciting
experiences. One calm day, with a lady passenger aboard, he made a
trip to Manly, followed by a run outside Sydney Heads; on the
return journey they had to face a southerly, and, besides getting a
ducking themselves, the motor threatened to "conk out" each time it
was drenched by a wave.</p>

<p>Then there was the night, when alone and without a light, he was
faced with the problem of replenishing the petrol tank and getting
out of the way of an approaching ferry. Could he do it in time?
Would the ferry skipper see the light of a match? Would the match
ignite the petrol? The skipper would see that all right and perhaps
fish him out of the "drink" before the sharks recovered from their
fright. As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the ferry
passed within a few feet, and its wash unexpectedly rocked Ted out
of the boat!</p>

<p>Another day he went on a fishing excursion to South Head with
Fred T. (minus two legs and an arm), and his four-year-old son.
Measured in terms of fish caught, the day was not very successful,
but they thoroughly enjoyed themselves until the engine broke down
and they had to row all the way home. It is possible that this
outing contributed to the illness that brought Ted back to Randwick
Hospital, but, in any case, the operation then performed would have
been necessary sooner or later.</p>

<p>Ted found the Repatriation Hospital&mdash;or, as it has been
called these many years, Prince of Wales Hospital&mdash;at Randwick
to be a greatly changed institution from that which he had known in
1917. All patients were now accommodated in the huts, the main
buildings having been condemned as unsuitable for a hospital. The
administration of the institution was greatly improved. In 1917
waste had been evident on every hand, whereas in 1932 economy was
rigidly enforced without the sacrifice of absolute essentials. The
surgical and medical treatment was still in the hands of the
leading surgeons and physicians, and ex-A.I.F. sisters were
carrying on the good work they had taken up years before. From the
view point of efficiency, neither the taxpayer nor the Digger
patient has any cause for complaint, yet something just a little
more than efficient treatment could be given the Digger inmate in
the eventide of his life.</p>

<p>But when, for example, a patient is accorded medical treatment
for a war disability to one eye, and refused treatment of the other
because he cannot prove that its condition is due to war service,
there seems little chance of small luxuries being granted. A recent
regulation that "woollen stump socks will only be replaced subject
to fair wear and tear on the production of worn-out or otherwise
unserviceable ones," is another illustration of the Repatriation
Department's zeal for economy. If the person responsible for
framing this regulation had to wear an artificial leg, he would
soon learn that new socks chafe and are requisitioned only when the
old ones are completely worn out.</p>

<p>However, even while the Digger growls outwardly, he to-day
inwardly accepts the inevitable philosophically. A kindly word from
his doctor, a smile from the sister as she tends his needs, a yarn
with a cobber, and a joke with the wardsmaid mean more to him than
anything the taxpayer can provide. W. S. Friend and Company's
concert party, some school teachers, and a few other unforgetting
folk who have never needed the glamour of war or possible social
achievement to spur them on, regularly attend the Repatriation and
Red Cross hospitals to entertain and provide party suppers. Unit
and other Digger organizations also contribute something to their
less fortunate cobbers, and so the 1500 odd inmates of these
institutions are not altogether forgotten.</p>

<p>"I hope they've r-r-read that b-book, <i>Br-bring 'em B-b-back
Alive,"</i> said Peter E. as they wheeled him to the theatre for
what everyone thought would be a hopeless operation. Peter had an
impediment in his speech, but the loss of half his innards and the
knowledge that the gas was eating him away did not interfere with
his sense of humour or with his cheerful ministrations to his
cobbers when he was able to get about. Whatever inconveniences the
loss of a leg or arm occasion, they are limited and, being
apparent, bring certain compensations. But for the soldier whose
scars are not visible to the naked eye and for the man who is
experiencing that lingering and painful death from gas&mdash;and
Peter was one of its victims&mdash;there are no compensations.</p>

<p>An account of the six months Ted spent in hospital in 1932 would
be practically a reiteration of the suffering, the humour,
the&mdash;well, everything else that he had previously experienced.
Again he was fortunate to receive not only the best possible
medical, surgical, and nursing treatment, but also the sympathetic
understanding and tolerance that, most of all, those war doctors,
sisters, and fellow patients can give. Like many other patients who
had the good fortune to meet Peter, Ted cannot think of the
individuals to whom he owes so much without seeing Peter and the
gold-filled tooth that went with his ever-ready smile&mdash;the
smile that covered up so much of his own suffering and encouraged
others to think less of, if not to forget, theirs. Whether he
twisted his old frame on the night he jumped out of bed to rush
across to Ted, whom he thought was in the throes of a death
seizure, is not known, but for the pains he suffered he blamed his
fit of laughter on discovering that the "seizure" came from one of
two cats under Ted's bed.</p>

<p>Ted was screened off from the rest of the ward. For weeks a
member of his family was present by his bedside day and night, it
being expected that one of the many seizures that he had would send
him out of the hospital feet first. Regaining consciousness after
one of these turns and seeing the worried and anxious face of his
father, he remarked: "Why look so miserable, Dad? This is not a
funeral. Norm H. is much worse than I; what won the last?"</p>

<p>Once able to get his feet to the floor, Ted asked for his
discharge, but this was only granted after a "nut" specialist had
declared him to be possessed of his mental faculties. The
specialist was probably right, for within a few weeks of his
leaving the hospital Ted again took up duty with a returned
soldiers' organization, his j ob being to find employment for its
members and attend to the accounting of its funds.</p>

<p>It was not until June 1934 that Ted gained admission to an
accountancy institute. The feeling of satisfaction that came with
this achievement compensated for the years of broken study and
overshadowed the realization that application of his qualifications
was limited to his physical capacity and the degree of
consideration that might be accorded him by client or employer.
But, so long as the provisions of the Repatriation Act afford him
his pension with the right to earn a "negligible percentage of a
living wage," he will have little cause to worry over the basic
material requirements of his family and self. While there are
returned soldiers' organizations to be served, and while his one
lung is able to provide the energy of life, his left arm is not
idle for want of something useful to do.</p>

<p>And now, as secretary to his battalion association&mdash;the
oldest being the president, Colonel Tod S., who, when adjutant, put
Ted on his horse on the march to Estaires&mdash;we leave him with
the veterans.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>It is Anzac Eve, 1935.</p>

<p>Colonel Fred S. has arrived from Newcastle. He and Ted are
standing at the bar of the "billet" surveying the rations that have
been provided for the boys who are to arrive by special
troop-trains about 11 p.m.</p>

<p>"We shall have to do better than that, Ted," suggests the
Colonel, to whom hot pies, sandwiches, and pickled onions are not
in keeping with the occasion.</p>

<p>"Pity the old <i>Beltana's</i> not in port," observes Ted, "a
dish of those stewed apples would recall old times."</p>

<p>But the Colonel has other ideas and off again he goes, to return
with boxes of richly iced cakes.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff to give 'em," Ted encourages, and they proceed
to review the arrangements for the following day...</p>

<p>Of a sudden there's a bang!</p>

<p>"Here they are!"</p>

<p>"Ah there, Geoff!"</p>

<p>"Struth! There's Fred!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Wes! You old cow."</p>

<p>"Blimey! If it ain't the old &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you for seventeen years. Put it there."</p>

<p>"Cripes! You're goin' bald. Put yer hat on so we'll know
yer."</p>

<p>"How's things, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Never seen the country better."</p>

<p>"What'll you have?"</p>

<p>"Mine's a pint."</p>

<p>"Look at old Bill on the sarsaparilla."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"The more we are together," someone strikes up and they all join
in.</p>

<p>"Know that bloke over there, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Know him! Why, it's the old Eric."</p>

<p>But Eric can't place him, not for the moment, then he eagerly
ventures: "It's not you, Ted? God! to think we should meet again.
Last time I saw you&mdash;about nineteen years ago&mdash;lying out
on top, coughing blood. How the hell did you get here?"</p>

<p>"Don't wake it up, Eric; only the good die young. How're your
old pins? What sort of a time did you have in Germany? Cripes! I've
written every bank in the State trying to find you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I've chucked the bank. Am doing commercial art now. Come
on, have a spot."</p>

<p>"Remember the railway embankment at Tel-el-Kebir? You know,
where we used to have bread and raspberry jam and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do I what? And beer. And what-o the night at Fleurbaix on the
old plonk and Nelson's blood?" "Why yes! It all seems like
yesterday."</p>

<p>And thus was spent the last hour of the eve of Anzac Day,
1935.</p>

<p>"Who's making the most noise here?" inquired a police inspector
who, with his sergeant, entered the bar at 2 a.m.</p>

<p>"Reckon it's me," said Ted.</p>

<p>"Well in that case we'll have a drink. Don't mind you all having
a good time, but the folk on the other side of the harbour are
complaining of the noise."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Then came the Dawn Service.</p>

<p>Out of the light mist&mdash;a mist that promised the dawn of a
great day&mdash;they came; treading with what seemed muffled feet.
Silently they gripped the hands of old cobbers. And youth, who knew
not war, joined with the veterans in the hushed silence before
dawn. Facing the flower-strewn Cenotaph, they stood silently and
steadily until the first blast of "Reveille." They were all
there&mdash;fallen comrades, veterans and youths. It was one great
reunion&mdash;a reunion of souls.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"Show a leg! Show a leg! Come on, Ted, you'll be late for
parade," and while Ted shaved, Colonel Fred S. attended to the
lacing of his shoes.</p>

<p>"This'll do me," said Ted. "Fancy having a full-blown colonel
for a batman!"</p>

<p>Then Colonel Tod S. arrived with great bunches of purple and
gold flowers to decorate the luncheon tables in the colours of the
old battalion. Eight o'clock saw the early birds on parade, and by
ten they were all present. And how did they meet and greet?</p>

<p>"Here comes Whippy."</p>

<p>"Who pinched the duck?"</p>

<p>"All the birds of the air fell a-sighing and a-sobbing, when
they heard of the death of poor Cock Robin...," broke forth the
song of greeting,, as Colonel B. appeared on the horizon.</p>

<p>Of the old signallers, Toc P., Lizz L., Ack E., Rex F., Ron C.,
Eric W., Cipher S., Bert S., and Eric S. were seen on parade. Some
looked prosperous and others not so good. But they were as one with
their laughter and expressions of greeting. Stan. E. was also there
and Dab F.'s hair looked as black and curly as ever. Wes O. and his
"emma gees;" Les W. and his boys of the band; ex-officers and other
ranks from the four companies&mdash;all shaking hands.</p>

<p>"Who wants a ticket for the luncheon?" bawled committeemen.</p>

<p>"How much?" asked one in a thread-bare coat.</p>

<p>"A dollar. Can't you do it? Well, here's a buckshee card."</p>

<p>The "buckshee cards" were tickets donated by members unable to
attend the luncheon. "For one of the boys who can't raise the
wind..." as one of them wrote. At the moment he was probably lying
back on his bed in the T.B. home with ear phones bringing him
something of the atmosphere, memories filling in the gaps.</p>

<p>And there were others. One, who had begrudged paying ten bob for
a set of miniature medals, spent a Bound on tickets for his less
fortunate cobbers...</p>

<p>The 30th Battalion (A.M.F.) colour party arrives. Their gleaming
bayonets guard the regimental colours and guidon won by the 30th
A.I.F. As the colours come into position, old soldiers cease
talking and, bareheaded, stand at attention.</p>

<p>The 30th Battalion (A.M.F.) pipe band has now taken up position.
The 673 ex-members of the old battalion stand, in column of
twelves, ready to march. Colonels Fred S. and Tod S. are at their
head. And Geoff C., D.C.M., secretary of the Battalion Club at
Newcastle, has the banner aloft.</p>

<p>The band strikes up. The battalion moves off. Old soldiers march
again. Along Macquarie Street the cheering populace greets them.
But in Martin Place there is only the sound of marching feet to the
tap-tap-tap of a side-drum, as, with hats held over hearts, they
divide into two columns and turn their dimmed eyes in salute
towards the Cenotaph.</p>

<p>On through the streets they march, living and feeling
again&mdash;Diggers. Sixty thousand of them&mdash;one for each of
those sixty thousand Australians sleeping Over There.</p>

<p>The last of the long column has wheeled into a "rising sun"
formation in the Domain&mdash;a rising sun of sixty thousand
veterans set in a sky of one hundred thousand of their people. As
the clear voice of their president rings out, the thunder of their
greetings and conversations ceases, and the service has
commenced.</p>

<p>Army chaplains conduct the service. There are hymns. There are
prayers for the continuance of Peace. A chaplain speaks:</p>

<p>"...The A.I.F. has a soul of its own, and even among the
difficult days of peace we still are one and indivisible...Many
have come long distances to shake the hands of the men with whom
they went to the war, and whom they learnt to love. That
brotherhood was not ready-made...We honoured our Allies; we
honoured our enemies for their courage and patriotism. This mutual
respect and understanding is what is needed in the world
to-day..."</p>

<p>The music of Chopin's "Funeral March" swells out over the
reverent gathering, and the deep silence which follows the majestic
last notes of the March is broken by the sounding of the "Last
Post." As the silvery voiced trumpets sound the resurrectional
notes of "Reveille...flags which have been drawn down, rise again
to the peak. Massed bands play the National Anthem, and on the note
of a single "G" the parade dismisses.</p>

<p>Tribute has been paid. Fallen comrades have been honoured. And,
as in the past&mdash;when Diggers had erected a rough wooden cross
to mark the last resting place of some beloved cobber, and made
their way to the <i>estaminet</i> and carried on&mdash;so these
sixty thousand Diggers went to their respective rendezvous. It was
as their absent comrades would wish.</p>

<p>Out of the teeming thousands came the remnants of the 30th
Battalion to have their photograph taken with the A.M.F. colour
party and band on the steps of the National Art Gallery. After this
they marched to the Customs House in lighter vein, punctuating the
band numbers with old marching songs. And when, with due ceremony,
the colours were paraded, cased, and marched off, the old battalion
was dismissed to advance independently on the luncheon room
objective.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>And now let us take leave of the veterans at their annual
reunion. It is July, the twentieth anniversary of the 19th of July,
1915, the day when Ted and many of his colleagues became soldiers.
The reunion has been opened with the toast of "The King." The boys
are warming up to the occasion. "Do you remember &mdash;&mdash;?"
are words that are heard on every hand&mdash;it might be the
password of the evening.</p>

<p>The president rises from the chair. "Gentlemen! I ask you to
stand, the toast is 'Fallen Comrades.'" There is complete silence.
Heads are bowed. The lights gradually fade and complete darkness
comes with the final note of the "Last Post." "At the going down of
the sun and in the morning we will remember them...the president
recites. "We will remember them...comes the firm and heartfelt
answer of the gathering; and, as Les W. brings the meeting back to
the strains of "Reveille...the lights gradually come on and the
remnants of the old battalion&mdash;carry on.</p>

<h2>A contemporary review, by F. M. Cutlack, of <i>There and
Back,</i><br>
by Rowland Edward Lording writing as A. Tiveychoc.</h2>

<p class="cp"><a href=

Morning Herald, 23 Nov 1935, page 13.</a>
</p>

<p>"There and Back," by "A. Tiveychoc," is more than a young
Australian soldier's story of the A.I.F., in which he served. The
author enlisted in June, 1915, on the day when he was 16 years old.
He first went into action in France with his battalion (the 30th)
on July 10, 1916. He survived mishap for nine days. On July 19 he
was knocked out by a burst of German machine-gun fire at close
quarters in the misguided attack of Fromelles. Thereafter, he was
in hospital for some four years, but he left it only to return
constantly. By 1928 he had undergone his fifty-second surgical
operation. His real war was his sixteen-year fight for life against
a chest wound, and its effects, which ought to have been fatal, and
against addiction to morphia, which his sufferings engendered.</p>

<p>It is an intensely personal story throughout, and there is a
wealth of significance in the title the plucky author of it has
chosen. His pen-name holds a touch of flippancy, characteristic
enough of the man himself, but it will require explanation to
civilians, unversed as they still remain in the intimacies of the
A.I.F. The 30th Battalion was a unit of the 8th Infantry Brigade,
which, with the 14th and 15th Brigades, formed the infantry of the
5th Australian Division. The commanding officer of the 8th Brigade
was Brigadier-General Tivey, in civil life a Melbourne stockbroker,
in the A.I.F. renowned for his solicitude for his men's welfare and
comfort. During the training period in Egypt, the 5th Division was
upon a famous occasion moved from Tel-el-Kebir in the desert to
Ferry's Post on the Canal. The 14th and 15th Brigades
marched&mdash;as stern a two days' trial under that desert sun as
raw troops ever faced, and the casualties were severe. The 8th
Brigade moved by train. Ever afterwards it was known throughout the
division and afterwards in the A.I.F. as "Tivey's Chocolate
Soldiers," or, more curtly as "Tivey's Chocs." It is true to that
habit of humorous cynicism in the Australian soldier that Mr.
Rowland E. Lording, who begins his story in the third person, with
his real name as though a biographer were telling it, should
present this unvarnished narrative of fortitude under cruel
suffering as the record of "A. Tiveychoc."</p>

<p>The tale of the training period in Egypt is the familiar one of
many other Australian soldiers' accounts. They were, one and all,
"tourists" in their own regard until they developed, by
imperceptible degrees, into collective efficiency as soldiers. The
growth was marked by the rise of esprit de corps in the new
battalions. Therein first a great comradeship and later an intense
pride in battle performance made a wonderful cement. No hardship
ever broke it. No forlorn hope ever defeated the shining courage,
indomitable resolution, and natural co-operation in mutual
assistance, fruits of a magnificent belief in their superiority,
which made the enemy regard the Australian divisions as some of
their most terrible opponents. The manner in which this supreme
confidence in themselves spread through the Australian force defies
analysis. It became an infection as well as a creed and a standard
of conduct. This book exemplifies it in a new aspect. Lording was
only a lad when he was knocked out, at a stage in the war when the
Australian divisions had their reputation in France entirely to
make; but the same spirit which arose to build up the A.I.F.'s
battle discipline on the Western Front glows unmistakably in this
youngster's fight, a long and lonely fight, for life in
hospital.</p>

<p>The full extent of Ted's injuries has been revealed (in the
field hospital) under the anaesthetic: gunshot wounds in left
chest, consisting of a small hole just below the neck and a large
cavity four inches in diameter on the left side (caused by a
machine gun,) as a result of which the left lung has been
shattered, and the small piece left is totally collapsed, while his
heart has moved, and can be seen through the hole. The right arm is
smashed through the elbow; in his back are four small shrapnel
wounds, one having partially paralysed the spine.</p>

<p>There were dally operations for a while. Once four inches of rib
were removed without an anaesthetic&mdash;chest conditions too bad
to permit of its being administered. Twice a day he was turned on
to his side to empty the cavity of pus, "which sometimes amounted
to as much as a kidney-dish full." He survived the agonising pain
of tetanus. He had to be forcibly fed. He had others' blood
injected into his veins to keep him alive. The wound healed in a
fashion, but in England it had to be opened again, the left wall of
the chest incised and drawn back while portions of six ribs were
removed. For weeks this broken chest was "irrigated" from rubber
tubes&mdash;"like a blanky Murrumbidgee irrigation farm"&mdash;some
of them draining the wounds, others injecting glycerine. Lording's
bottle of ribs, kept defiantly on top of his hospital locker,
steadily filled, and he insisted on the nurse's dusting it each
day. Then hospital ship to Australia, then more operations at
Randwick, discharge, the addiction to morphia, struggle to earn a
living, back to hospital (Prince Alfred's), more operations, and
then the great fight to overcome the drug habit, success, study to
become an accountant; again in 1932 back to Randwick, where for
weeks he hovered on the border of death, recovery, out into the
world again to make his living, and finally qualification in the
profession he had chosen. In the intervals of this later struggle
he married and became the father of three children.</p>

<p>This is a revelation of gallantry unsurpassed. To extol it, or
to attempt to describe it, after a reading of the author's own
simple story, would be an excess. Mr. Lording's own modest account
is the finest possible conveyance of it.<br><br></p>
