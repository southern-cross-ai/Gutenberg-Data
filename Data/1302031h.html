  <h2><a id="bk1"
     name="bk1">BOOK I. JOHN HABERGEON</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch1-1"
     name="ch1-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  A View From An Old Barrow On The South Downs</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FAIRER spot than this cannot be found amidst the whole range
  of the South Downs&mdash;nor one commanding more delightful views.</p>

  <p>Look at it and judge.</p>

  <p>It is the rounded summit of a hill; or, to speak with greater precision,
  the mid-summit of a series of soft bosomy eminences, springing from a hilly
  ridge, that trends towards the coast, and rises and falls smoothly and gently
  in its course, like the waves of a slightly agitated sea. The lovely mount is
  covered with short elastic sward, redolent of thyme and other sweet-smelling
  herbs, and is crowned by an ancient bowl-shaped British barrow, on the bank
  of which we will seat ourselves, and look around.</p>

  <p>How pleasing is the prospect! how fresh the air that visits us! No breeze
  so fine and invigorating as that of these Sussex downs; no turf so springy to
  the foot as their smooth greensward. A flock of larks flies past us, and a
  cloud of mingled rooks and starlings wheels overhead. Mark yon little
  T-shaped cuttings on the slope below us&mdash;those are the snares set by the
  shepherds for the delicious wheatear&mdash;our English ortolan. The fairies
  still haunt this spot, and hold their midnight revels upon it, as yon
  dark-green rings testify. The common folk hereabouts term the good people
  &ldquo;Pharisees,&rdquo; and style those emerald circles
  &ldquo;hag-tracks:&rdquo; why, we care not to inquire. Enough for us, the
  fairies are not altogether gone. A smooth, soft carpet is here spread out for
  Oberon and Titania and their attendant elves to dance upon by moonlight; and
  there is no lack of mushrooms to form tables for Puck&rsquo;s banquets.</p>

  <p>Own that no hills can be more beautiful than these South Downs. They may
  want height, boldness, grandeur, sublimity; they possess not forest, rock,
  torrent, or ravine; but they have gentleness, softness, and other endearing
  attributes. We will not attempt to delineate the slight but infinite
  varieties of form and aspect that distinguish one hill from its neighbour;
  for though a strong family likeness marks them all, each down has an
  individual character. Regarded in combination with each other, the high
  ranges form an exquisite picture.</p>

  <p>Contemplation of such a scene soothes rather than excites, and inspires
  only feelings of placid enjoyment. We are called upon for no violent emotion.
  We are not required to admire Nature in her wildest and most savage aspect.
  We have a peaceful landscape before us, of a primitive character, and
  possessing accompaniments of pastoral life. Yonder is the shepherd, with
  crook and dog, watching his flock browse on the thymy slopes&mdash;the
  unequalled sheep of the South Downs, remember. At our feet lies a
  well-cultivated valley, with broad patches of turnip and mangel-wurzel on one
  side, and a large stubble-field on the other, where the ploughman with his
  yoke of patient oxen is at work. In this valley you may note a farm-shed and
  a sheepfold, with rows of haystacks and cornstacks at various points,
  evidencing the fertility of the soil. In front of us is the British Channel.
  A burst of sunshine illumines the tall white cliffs on the east, and gleams
  upon the far-off lighthouse. That pharos is on Beachy Head. On the near
  height overlooking the sea stands a windmill, while a solitary barn forms a
  landmark on that distant hill. Altogether, a charming picture.</p>

  <p>But we have not yet fully examined it.</p>

  <p>The beauteous hill, on the brow of which we are seated, has necessarily a
  valley on either side. On the right, and immediately beneath us, is a pretty
  little village, nestling amid a grove of trees, above whose tops you may
  discern the tower of a small, grey old church. With this village we trust to
  make you more intimately acquainted by-and-by. It is Ovingdean. On the left,
  and nearer the sea, you may discern another, and considerably larger village
  than Ovingdean, almost as picturesque as the latter, and possessing a grey,
  antique church at its northern extremity. This second village is
  Rottingdean.</p>

  <p>Behind and around on every side, save towards the sea, are
  downs&mdash;downs with patches of purple heather or grey gorse clothing their
  sides&mdash;downs with small holts within their coombs, partially cultivated,
  or perfectly bare&mdash;everywhere downs.</p>

  <p>Pleasant it is where we sit to watch the clouds chase each other across
  the valleys, up the hill-side, over the hill-top, then losing them for a
  while, behold them again on a more distant eminence, producing in their
  passage exquisite effects of light and shade. Meet emblem those fleeting
  clouds of our own quick passage to eternity.</p>

  <p>Smiling, and sunny, and joy-inspiring are the downs now; but at times they
  have a graver aspect. At shuddering dawn, or at the midnight hour, they have
  a solemn and mysterious look, and seem, like the Sphynx, to mutter secrets of
  the Past. Of most other places in the land the ancient features are changed,
  disfigured, or wholly obliterated; but the old visage of the Sussex Downs is
  unaltered. It is the same as when the Celtic Britons held their funeral
  ceremonies on this green mount; as when the warlike Romans made their camps
  upon yonder neighbouring hill; as when our Saxon ancestors dwelt in those
  secluded valleys, and gave names to them which we still retain. What wonder
  that such ancient hills&mdash;ancient, but endowed with perpetual
  youth&mdash;should sometimes discourse of the great people they have known!
  What wonder when the scene is the same that the shades of the mighty departed
  should sometimes revisit the theatre of their earthly actions!</p>

  <p>Before quitting our seat on this old tumulus, let us hear what delightful
  Gilbert White has to say about the district: &ldquo;Though I have now
  travelled the Sussex Downs upwards of thirty years,&rdquo; writes this
  charming natural historian, &ldquo;yet I still investigate that chain of
  majestic mountains with fresh admiration year by year, and think I see new
  beauties every time I traverse it. Mr. Ray was so ravished with the prospect
  from Plumpton Plain near Lewes, that he mentions those scenes in his
  &lsquo;Wisdom of God in the works of Creation&rsquo; with the utmost
  satisfaction, and thinks them equal to anything he had seen in the finest
  parts of Europe. For my own part, I think there is something peculiarly sweet
  and amusing in the shapely figured aspect of chalk hills in preference to
  those of stone, which are rugged, broken, abrupt, and shapeless. Perhaps I
  may be singular in my opinion, and not so happy as to convey to you the same
  idea; but I never contemplate these mountains without thinking I perceive
  somewhat analogous to growth in their gentle swellings and smooth fungus-like
  protuberances, their fluted sides, and regular hollows and slopes, that carry
  at once the air of vegetative dilatation and expansion. Or, was there ever a
  time when these immense masses of calcareous matter were thrown into
  fermentation by some adventitious moisture; were raised and leavened into
  such shapes by some plastic power; and so made to swell and heave their broad
  backs into the sky so much above the less animated clay of the wild
  below?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With all our admiration of the amiable author of the &ldquo;Natural
  History of Selborne,&rdquo; we are not disposed to regard our South Downs in
  the light of vegetable productions or chemical fermentations; but we leave
  the solution of the question to the geologist.</p>

  <p>And now let us descend to Ovingdean, which lies at our feet.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-2"
     name="ch1-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  Ovingdean Grange In The Year Sixteen Hundred And Fifty-One</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SINCE the year 1651 but slight change has taken place in the
  general aspect of the sequestered little village of Ovingdean (Offingas den,
  in Saxon), situated in a charming dene, or woody valley, amidst the South
  Downs, and within a mile of the coast.</p>

  <p>During the two centuries that have elapsed since the date assigned to our
  story, the habitations of this secluded little village, which,
  notwithstanding its contiguity to the queen of watering-places, Brighton,
  seems still quite out of the world, have scarcely&mdash;with one important
  exception, namely, the modern mansion known as Ovingdean
  House&mdash;increased in number, or consequence. Indeed, the Grange, which,
  in the middle of the seventeenth century, was the principal residence of the
  place, is not only greatly reduced in size, but has entirely lost its
  original and distinctive character. Still, regarded without reference to the
  past, Ovingdean Grange, as it now appears, is a fair-proportioned,
  cheerful-looking domicile, and with its white walls and pleasant garden, full
  of arbutuses, laurestines, holms, and roses, offers a very favourable
  specimen of a Sussex farm-house. In one respect, and that by no means an
  immaterial one, the existing Grange far surpasses its predecessor; namely, in
  the magnitude and convenient arrangements of its farmyard, as well as in the
  number of its barns, cow-houses, and other outbuildings, all of which are
  upon a scale never dreamed of in the olden time.</p>

  <p>But as it is with the ancient house that we have now to do, we must
  endeavour to give some notion of it. Even in 1651, Ovingdean Grange was old,
  having been built in the reign of Henry VIII. Constructed of red brick,
  chequered with diamonds, formed of other bricks, glazed, and of darker hue,
  mingled with flints, it seemed destined to endure for ages, and presented a
  very striking frontage, owing to the bold projections of its bay-windows with
  their stone posts and lintels, its deep arched portal with a stone escutcheon
  above it, emblazoned with the arms of the Maunsels, at that time its
  possessors, its stone quoins and cornices, its carved gables, its high roof,
  covered with tiles entrusted with orange-tawny mosses and lichens, and its
  triple clusters of tall and ornamented chimney-shafts.</p>

  <p>Old Ovingdean Grange did not want a rookery. In a fine grove of elms,
  occupying part of the valley towards the south, a large colony of these
  aristocratic birds had taken up their quarters. Nor must we omit to mention
  that many of the trees, in the upper branches of which the rooks&rsquo; nests
  might be seen, had attained a girth and altitude not a little remarkable,
  considering their proximity to the sea. It has been already intimated that
  the ancient farm- yard was neither so extensive nor so well arranged as its
  successor, but it possessed one of those famous old circular dovecots, which
  used to be the pride of a Sussex country-house, and which, before
  pigeon-matches were introduced, never failed to supply the family table with
  a savoury pie or a roast. At the rear of the house was a garden, walled
  round, and laid out in the old-fashioned style, with parterres and terraces;
  and beyond it was an orchard full of fruit- trees. Higher up on the down was
  a straggling little holt, or thicket, the trees of which, by their stunted
  growth and distorted shapes, manifested the influence of the sea-breezes.
  When we have mentioned a large close, encompassed by a shaw, or fence of low
  trees, and displaying within its area a few venerable hawthorns, ancient
  denizens of the downs, we shall have particularized all the domains of old
  Ovingdean Grange.</p>

  <p>The little village of Ovingdean, consisted then, as now, of a few
  neatly-kept cottages, clustered like beehives near the mansion, some three or
  four in the valley, but the most part amongst the trees on the side of the
  eastern down. These cottages were tenanted by the bailiff, the husbandmen,
  shepherds, and other hinds employed at the Grange.</p>

  <p>But the most pleasing feature of the place, and one by which it is happily
  yet distinguished, was the church. Scarce a stone&rsquo;s throw from the
  Grange, at the foot of a wooded escarpment, on the western side of the dene,
  and on a green and gentle declivity, stood, and still stands, the reverend
  little pile. Grey and old was Ovingdean church at the time of our story, for
  its architecture is Norman and Early English, but it is upwards of two
  centuries older now, and somewhat greyer in consequence, though Time has
  dealt kindly with it, and has touched it with a hand so loving and tender,
  that if he has robbed it of aught, he has only added to its beauty. Peace
  rests upon the antique little fane, and breathes from out its hoary walls.
  Peace rests upon the grassy mounds and carefully-tended tombs lying within
  its quiet precincts. Nothing more hushed, more sequestered, more winningly
  and unobtrusively beautiful, can be conceived than this simple village
  churchyard. The grey old walls that surround it, and shut it in like a
  garden, the trees that shade it, and completely shelter the holy edifice on
  the north, give it a peculiar air of privacy and tranquillity. Subdued by the
  calming influences of the spot, the heart becomes melted, the thoughts soar
  heavenward. Truly, a quiet resting-place after the turmoil of life.</p>

  <p>Nor will the devotional feelings inspired by a pause within these hallowed
  precincts be lessened by an entrance into the sacred edifice itself; for
  there, if you love simplicity, you shall find it; there you shall behold a
  primitive little village church, without ornament, yet possessing the richest
  ornament in the absence of all decorative artifice; lacking not the graces of
  ecclesiastical architecture as displayed in the rounded arches dividing its
  nave from the chancel, and elsewhere in the structure; there, nothing shall
  disturb your religious train of thought; there, you shall find a rustic
  congregation, and shall listen to rustic voices chanting the holy hymn; and
  above all, you shall hear our Church&rsquo;s noble service well and worthily
  performed, and shall have good ghostly council from a good man&rsquo;s
  lips.</p>

  <p>Though sufficing for the thinly-peopled parish in which it stands, the
  dimensions of Ovingdean church are modest enough, the nave and chancel, taken
  together, being little larger than those of many a private chapel. Aisles it
  has none, though it may once have possessed a south wing, marks of an arch
  being still discernible on the external wall on this side of the edifice; the
  roof is open, and crossed and supported by stout beams of oak; and the low
  square western tower, entered from within, serves the joint purposes of
  vestiary and belfry. We should prefer the true colour of the stone and timber
  to whitewash, but the latter, at all events, is clean and cheerful to look
  upon, and serves to display the many hatchments and marble tablets reared
  against the walls. Over the screen separating the nave from the chancel may
  be read these comforting words: &ldquo;Come unto me all ye that labour and
  are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; Together with this verse
  from the Psalms, well suited to the place: &ldquo;This shall be my rest
  forever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But though we love the old pile, we must not linger within it too long,
  but go forth into its quiet churchyard, now basking in sunshine, and visited
  by the sweet and delicate air of the downs. If there be a gleam of sunshine
  in the skies, it seems to seek out this favoured spot; while, when the rain
  descends here, it falls gently as the tears of a mourner. Would you see, ere
  we pass out by the arched gateway leading to the rectory, two relics of two
  centuries ago? you may perceive them in yon pair of decayed elder-trees,
  whose hoar, gnarled, corrugated trunks, and fantastically twisted branches,
  flung out like huge antlers, have but little vitality about them, and yet are
  deservedly spared for their age and picturesque appearance.</p>

  <p>Where the present cheerful and commodious parsonage-house now stands,
  stood, in earlier days, a small monastic-looking structure, of higher
  antiquity even than the Grange; and this time-honoured edifice, all traces of
  which, except some portions of its garden walls, have disappeared, had served
  as an abiding- place for many successive pastors of the neighbouring
  church.</p>

  <p>But alas! in the unhappy and distracted times of which we propose to
  treat, this little manse sheltered no minister of our Church. A woful change
  had come over it. The good pastor, who for years had dwelt there, honoured
  and beloved by all who profited by his teaching; who was pious, charitable,
  tolerant, and irreproachable in conduct; this excellent man, with whom no
  fault could be found, save that he was a firm and consistent supporter of the
  established Church of England, and a resolute maintainer of its tenets and of
  episcopal jurisdiction, was deprived of his benefice, driven from his
  dwelling, and no longer permitted to exercise his sacred functions within
  those walls where his voice had so often been heard. The Reverend Ardingly
  Beard, for so was named this sufferer in a good cause, bore his own crosses
  without a murmur, but he ceased not to deplore the fallen state of the
  Church, now become a prey to ravening wolves. When condemned as an obstinate
  and incurable prelatist and malignant, and dispossessed of his church and
  living, he had the additional grief and mortification of finding his place
  occupied by the Reverend Master Increase Micklegift (as the latter chose to
  style himself, though his real name was Zaccheus Stonegall), an Independent
  minister, and a zealous expounder of his own doctrines, but whom Mr. Beard
  regarded as a hypocrite, and highly dangerous to the spiritual welfare of his
  somewhile flock.</p>

  <p>But the deprived clergyman did not retire altogether from the scene of his
  labours, though prevented from continuing them as heretofore. He obtained an
  asylum at the Grange, with its owner and his assured and sympathizing friend,
  the Royalist Colonel Wolston Maunsel. For many years a widower, the good
  pastor had found solace in the companionship and affectionate attentions of
  the only child left him, his daughter Dulcia. At the time of his suspension
  from his religious functions, which unhappy event occurred about four years
  before the date of our story. Dulcia Beard had just reached her fifteenth
  spring, and though she felt the blow at the moment with as much acuteness as
  her father, yet with the happy elasticity of youth she speedily shook off its
  effects, and regained her wonted buoyancy of spirit. In sooth, there was not
  much to make her regret the change of abode. Apartments were assigned to her
  father and herself at the Grange, where they might dwell as retired as they
  pleased, and in order to remove any sense of dependence on the part of his
  reverend guest, Colonel Maunsel appointed him to the office of his domestic
  chaplain. Thus, though forbidden, under the penalty of fine and imprisonment,
  to preach to his somewhile flock in public, or even to perform the
  church-service covertly, our good clergyman was enabled to address in private
  such as were not backsliders or apostates, and prevent them from wavering in
  the true faith. Greatly beholden, therefore, did the worthy man feel to him
  who, under Providence, afforded an asylum fraught with so many advantages to
  himself and his dearly beloved child.</p>

  <p>In all respects Dulcia Beard merited her father&rsquo;s love. A gentler,
  sweeter disposition than hers could not be found; purer and higher principles
  than she possessed never existed in female bosom. As she grew towards
  womanhood her personal charms became more fully developed. Soft and delicate
  in mould, her features expressed in every line the amiability and goodness of
  her nature. Impossible to doubt the candour of her clear, blue, earnest eyes.
  Equally impossible to misunderstand the serenity of her marble brow, or the
  composure of her classic countenance. Calm was her countenance, but not cold;
  classic were her features in form, but with nothing rigorous in their
  outline. If her features corresponded with her nature, so did her person
  correspond with her features. Graceful in the highest degree, her figure was
  tall, and of exquisite symmetry. Her manner was entirely unsophisticated, and
  captivating from its very simplicity. The very reverse of a modish
  gentlewoman was Dulcia Beard, and owed none of her attractions to art.
  Whether any other image beside that of her father had found a place within
  that gentle bosom, will be seen as we proceed.</p>

  <p>Colonel Wolston Maunsel of Ovingdean Grange has been described as a
  Royalist, but his description of himself, &ldquo;that he was a Cavalier to
  the backbone,&rdquo; would be more correct. Colonel Maunsel hated the rebels
  and Roundheads and the whole Republican party, civil, military, and
  religious, as he hated poison; but if he had a special object of aversion it
  was Noll Cromwell. The execution of Charles deepened the colonel&rsquo;s
  animosity towards the regicides, and after the direful tragedy of Whitehall,
  he assumed a mourning habit, vowing never to put it off till the death of the
  martyred monarch should be fully avenged upon his murderers.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel was descended from a good old Sussex family; the branch he
  belonged to having settled at Ovingdean. Though not brought up to the
  profession of arms, but rather from habit and position disposed to lead the
  life of a country squire, our loyal gentleman, on the outbreak of the Civil
  War, alarmed by the imminence of the crisis, and instigated by his own strong
  Cavalier feelings, had deemed it incumbent upon him to abandon a home he
  delighted in, together with a wife whom he passionately loved, and joined the
  standard of the king. For several years Wolston Maunsel served under Prince
  Rupert, and shared in the victories as well as in the defeats of that great,
  though somewhat rash, commander. He fought at the famous battle of Edgehill,
  where Rupert&rsquo;s matchless cavalry did such signal execution upon the
  Parliamentarians, at Lansdown Hill, and at Chalgrove Field; was present at
  the sieges of Bristol and Bolton, at the important but ill-starred battle of
  Marston Moor, and at Ledbury, after which engagement he obtained from the
  Prince the command of a regiment of dragoons. Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s last
  appearance on the battle-field was at Naseby, where his regiment was
  completely cut to pieces by Fairfax, and he himself severely wounded and made
  prisoner. With other captives he was sent by the victorious Parliamentary
  leaders to the castle of Chester, and detained long enough there to shatter
  his health. Heavy fines were inflicted upon him, which greatly impoverished
  his estates, but after nearly a year&rsquo;s confinement he was released, and
  retired to his residence at Ovingdean, where we have found him.</p>

  <p>But other calamities, besides defeat and loss of property, had befallen
  the unfortunate Cavalier. During the time of his immurement within Chester
  Castle, his beloved wife, who was not permitted to share her husband&rsquo;s
  captivity, had died from grief and anxiety. An only son, then just sixteen,
  was, however, left him. Had the Civil War continued, this high-spirited
  youth, who inherited all his father&rsquo;s principles of loyalty, and hated
  the Republicans as heartily as his father, would have followed in the old
  Cavalier&rsquo;s footsteps; but when Colonel Maunsel was set free, the
  struggle was well-nigh over, the Royalist party was crushed for the time, and
  did not rally again for nearly five years, when Charles the Second was
  crowned at Scone, and entered England at the head of a small army, with the
  futile hope, as it proved, of conquering his rebellious kingdom.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Clavering Maunsel, who by this time had become a
  remarkably handsome young man of one-and-twenty, and was as eager for the
  fray as a war- horse stirred by the trumpet, was despatched by the colonel to
  aid the youthful monarch. If his father had tried to restrain the young
  Cavalier, the attempt would have been ineffectual; but the loyal old colonel
  did no such thing. On the contrary, he commanded him to go; gave him his own
  sword, and bade him use it against the enemies of the king, and the slayers
  of the king&rsquo;s father. While straining his son to his breast at parting,
  the gallant old Cavalier declared that he envied him, his sole grief being
  that he could not accompany him. &ldquo;But of what use to his Majesty would
  be a battered old soldier like myself, who can scarce move limb without
  help?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;So go, my son, and fight for me in the
  righteous cause. Strike down those accursed traitors and
  parricides&mdash;slay them, and spare not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With his son, Colonel Maunsel sent a veteran follower, to whose care he
  knew the young man could be safely confided; and the measure was very
  judicious, as the event proved. The faithful attendant to whom Clavering
  Maunsel was entrusted was an ancient trooper in the king&rsquo;s service,
  named John Habergeon, who had fought with the colonel in many a rude
  engagement with the rebels, and had bled with him at Naseby. Though numbering
  more years than his old master, John Habergeon&rsquo;s strength was by no
  means on the decline. Hoary was he as an Alp; his gigantic frame was as hard
  as iron; and few younger men could cope with him in personal encounter. John
  Habergeon&rsquo;s exterior was by no means prepossessing. His features were
  harsh, and his manner crabbed and stern. His figure was gaunt and tall; and
  he stood so stiff and erect that he lost not an inch of his stature. Yet
  under his rugged exterior there beat a heart tender as a woman&rsquo;s; and
  follower more faithful and devoted could not be found than trusty John
  Habergeon.</p>

  <p>It was not without some difficulty and danger that Clavering and his
  companion managed to reach Worcester, in which loyal city the adventurous
  young king had established his head-quarters. Though the new comer brought
  him no important levy of horse or foot, but only a single follower, Charles
  received the young man with great satisfaction, and well aware of his
  father&rsquo;s high character, misfortunes, and fidelity to the royal cause,
  at once bestowed upon him the command of a troop of horse under Colonel
  Wogan.</p>

  <p>It is not our purpose to describe the events preceding the disastrous day
  of Worcester, nor to furnish any details of that fatal engagement, when the
  hopes of the young monarch and his adherents were utterly destroyed. Having
  as little sympathy as the Cavaliers themselves with the Republican army and
  its victorious general, it is no pleasure to us to record their successes.
  Suffice it then to say, that while preparations were making by Charles and
  his generals for the coming conflict, Clavering exhibited the utmost ardour
  and impatience; and when at length the luckless 3rd of September arrived,
  proved himself by his fiery courage, and perhaps by his rashness, to be his
  father&rsquo;s son. Some intelligence of his brave doings during the battle
  had been received at Ovingdean Grange, but what became of him afterwards was
  not known. His name did not appear amongst the list of the slain; but such
  lists in those troublous times were ever imperfect. Wogan&rsquo;s regiment,
  it was known, had suffered severely in covering the king&rsquo;s retreat; and
  what so probable as that foolhardy and inexperienced Clavering had fallen
  then. So at least feared his father. So feared another, whose gentle heart
  was distracted by doubt and anxiety.</p>

  <p>Sad presentiments had filled Dulcia&rsquo;s breast when young Maunsel,
  full of martial ardour and enthusiasm for his cause, had set out on the
  expedition. She had accompanied him to the summit of the down overlooking the
  neighbouring town of Brightelmstone, then giving little promise of its future
  magnitude and importance, and chiefly noticeable from this point by a cluster
  of quaint old houses, with red-tiled roofs and gables, grouped around the
  ancient church on the hill, together with a short scattered street,
  consisting mostly of cottages and mean habitations, running towards the
  sea:&mdash;she had accompanied him, we say, to this point, and after a
  tearful parting&mdash;tearful on her side, at least&mdash;had gazed wistfully
  after him till he gained the brow of the opposite hill, when he waved a
  farewell with the scarf she had embroidered for him, and disappeared from
  view.</p>

  <p>Had he disappeared for ever? was the question that occupied Dulcia, as she
  returned to the Grange with her attendant, Patty Whinchat. Very beautiful and
  very picturesque did the old house appear, embosomed amidst its trees, and
  with the old church adjoining, as viewed from the high ground she was
  traversing, but she looked not towards it, for her thoughts were wandering in
  another direction. Patty, a lively little damsel, and disposed to take a
  cheerful view of things, chattered away, and assured her mistress that Master
  Clavering would soon be back again, after killing all the Roundheads; but
  after a while, receiving neither response nor other encouragement to talk,
  she became silent, and tried to shed a few tears for company.</p>

  <p>Often did Dulcia recur to this parting with Clavering, and never without
  reviving the sad forebodings which she had then experienced. These, however,
  were vague fears, and easily shaken off. But when she heard of
  Worcester&rsquo;s disastrous fight&mdash;when rumours of dreadful slaughter
  of the Royalists reached her&mdash;when day after day passed, and no tidings
  came of Clavering&mdash;we may imagine how much she suffered. She dreaded to
  receive confirmation of her worst fears, and yet this suspense was well-nigh
  intolerable. By day a pallid image with stony eyes was ever before her; and
  at night she beheld the same figure in her dreams, stretched like a
  blood-stained corpse upon the battle-plain.</p>

  <p>As to Colonel Maunsel, though anxiety as to his son&rsquo;s fate was
  naturally uppermost in his bosom, the consideration of what he deemed to be a
  great national calamity weighed so heavily upon him, as in some degree to
  absorb his private griefs. The issue of the battle of Worcester he deemed
  fatal to his country. England was dishonoured; its glory obscured. Right,
  religion, loyalty, were trampled under foot. Republicanism was clearly in the
  ascendant: the star of monarchy, which had shone for a moment with its
  accustomed splendour, had set, he feared, for ever. While deploring the
  prostrate condition of his own party, now at the mercy of its hated
  opponents, he felt yet more acutely the terrible jeopardy in which the head
  of that party was placed. What had become of Charles, after the conflict on
  which he had staked his fortunes, the colonel could only conjecture. But he
  felt certain that the royal fugitive had as yet contrived to elude the
  vigilance of his enemies. Charles&rsquo;s capture would have been too loudly
  proclaimed not to be quickly known throughout the realm. But it was almost
  equally certain that the young king was yet within the country, and his
  retreat might, therefore, at any moment be discovered. A large reward was
  offered for his capture; and the penalties of high treason, loss of life and
  forfeiture of estate, were adjudged to such as should harbour him, or aid in
  his escape. Colonel Maunsell was well aware, from his own feelings, that no
  personal risk would prevent any loyal subject from assisting his sovereign;
  but he naturally dreaded lest the reward offered by the council of state
  might tempt some sordid knave to cause Charles&rsquo;s betrayal. All these
  considerations sorely perplexed and grieved the old Cavalier&rsquo;s spirit.
  The burden of his anxiety was almost greater than he could bear, and
  threatened to bow him to the ground. He began to fear that the messenger who
  brought him word that his son had been found amongst the slain, would tell
  him that the king had been captured. Such tidings, doubly calamitous, he was
  well assured, would prove his own death-blow.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-3"
     name="ch1-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  Showing What Befel Clavering Maunsel<br>
  After The Battle Of Worcester</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A WEEK had elapsed since the calamitous day at
  Worcester&mdash;a week, as we have shown, of frightful anxiety and suspense
  to the principal inmates of Ovingdean Grange&mdash;but still no tidings came
  of Clavering Maunsel, or of his faithful follower, John Habergeon. Neither
  had news, good or bad, been received relative to the fugitive king.</p>

  <p>Somewhat late at night, the old colonel was sitting with Mr. Beard and
  Dulcia in the great hall of the mansion. Supper had been discussed, though a
  couple of long-necked flasks with tall glasses were still left upon the huge
  oak table; prayers had been read by the good clergyman; and the little party
  were conversing sadly together before their separation for the night. Colonel
  Maunsel ordinarily retired at an earlier hour than this, but he cared not now
  to seek his chamber, since he found no rest within it.</p>

  <p>The hall in which we discovered the little party was spacious and lofty,
  with a moulded ceiling, panels of dark oak, a high carved mantelpiece, deep
  bay- windows, having stained glass within them, and an elaborately carved
  doorway corresponding with the mantelpiece, and opening upon a corridor.
  Several old family portraits, male and female, in the costume of James the
  First&rsquo;s time, and in that of Elizabeth, adorned the walls. Mingled with
  these portraits were trophies formed by pieces of old armour, coats of mail
  and shirts of mail, skull-caps, bucklers, and chanfrons, surrounded by
  two-handed swords, battle- axes, maces, cross-bows and long bows; while a
  buck&rsquo;s head with enormous antlers occupied a conspicuous position
  opposite the fireplace. The night being chilly, a comfortable wood fire
  blazed upon the dogs on the hearth, and diffused a cheerful light around. A
  few high-backed arm-chairs of richly carved oak, cushioned with crimson
  Utrecht velvet, together with an open cupboard, on the shelves of which were
  displayed several capacious flagons, parcel-gilt goblets, and other drinking
  vessels in glass and silver, with a massive salver, gilt like the goblets, in
  the midst of them, constituted the furniture of the room.</p>

  <p>There was one portrait, hung apart from the others, that claims special
  attention. It was a full-length picture, by no less a painter than Vandyke,
  of a young and lovely woman, attired in a robe of rich white satin, made very
  low in front, so as to display a neck of ravishing beauty, and far whiter
  than the satin, pearl ornaments upon the stomacher, a pearl necklace around
  the throat, pearl earrings, and bracelets of the same gems on the arms. The
  features of this charming personage had a somewhat pensive expression that by
  no means detracted from their loveliness; the eyes were magnificent, and
  black as night; the hair of raven hue, contrasting forcibly with the dazzling
  whiteness of the skin. The dark locks were taken back from the centre of the
  forehead, and disposed in thick ringlets at the sides of the face, their sole
  ornament being a spray of green leaves placed on the left of the head. This
  portrait, which bore the date 1630, represented Lady Clemence Maunsel, the
  colonel&rsquo;s wife, and when gazing at her bewitching lineaments, no one
  could wonder that he had passionately loved her, or that he ceased not to
  deplore her loss.</p>

  <p>At the time that his wife&rsquo;s portrait was painted, Wolston Maunsel
  was scarcely her inferior in point of personal appearance, and they were
  noted as the handsomest couple in Sussex. Long years and much suffering, both
  of mind and body, had done their work with him, but he had still a very noble
  and striking countenance. His locks were grizzled, and flowed over his neck
  and shoulders in Cavalier fashion; his beard was pointed in the style
  familiarized to us by Vandyke. His figure was tall and spare, but his wounds
  and after sufferings had stiffened his limbs, afflicting him with rheumatic
  pains, which caused him to move with difficulty, and prevented all active
  exertion. His features were finely formed, but very thin, his complexion
  dark, and his black overhanging eyebrows and keen grey eyes gave him a stern
  and austere expression. His habiliments, we have said, were sable; his black
  taffeta doublet and vest were of the graceful fashion of Charles the
  First&rsquo;s time; his trunk hose had knots of ribbons at the knees; black
  silk hose encased his still shapely legs; and his shoes were of Spanish
  leather, high-heeled, and with black roses on the instep. A wide falling band
  of lawn, edged with lace, set off the old Cavalier&rsquo;s handsome
  physiognomy.</p>

  <p>A venerable-looking man was the Reverend Ardingly Beard, with a bald head
  and the snowy honours of age upon his chin, for the clergy of those days wore
  the beard. Bitter had been his cup, but it had not soured his heart, as was
  plain from his benevolence of expression and kindliness of manner.
  Resignation to the will of Heaven was the governing rule of the good
  man&rsquo;s life, and the influence of this principle was apparent not only
  in his conduct, but in his aspect and demeanour. Patience and humility were
  written in legible characters in his countenance. Prohibited by the
  enactments in force against the clergy of the Church of England from wearing
  the cassock, he was compelled to assume the garb of a civilian. His garments
  were sombre in colour, like those of the colonel, but of a coarser fabric.
  Little more need be said of the worthy pastor, except that, as his eyesight
  had begun to fail him, he was obliged to have recourse to spectacles.</p>

  <p>Dulcia Beard has already been described as singularly beautiful, but sooth
  to say, if her anxiety should not be speedily relieved, her beauty will run
  great risk of being materially impaired. Already, her cheeks have lost their
  bloom, and the lustre of her eyes is sadly dimmed. Her manner, too, has quite
  lost its cheerfulness and she heaves deep and frequent sighs. Patty Whinchat,
  her handmaiden, is in despair about her young mistress, and feels certain,
  unless Master Clavering should come back, and quickly too, that she will
  break her heart. Patty cannot understand why Mistress Dulcia should be so
  foolish, seeing that there are other young men in the world quite as handsome
  as Master Clavering, but there is no use reasoning with her&mdash;pine away
  she undoubtedly will, in spite of all that can be said.</p>

  <p>By degrees the conversation, which, as may be supposed, had never been of
  a lively character, began to flag, until at length it wholly ceased. Fain
  would Dulcia have withdrawn, but she did not like to disturb Colonel Maunsel,
  who remained with his face buried in his hands, as if lost in gloomy thought.
  After a long pause the old gentleman roused himself, as if by a great effort,
  and for a moment gazed vacantly at his companions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I crave pardon,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he had collected his
  scattered thoughts. &ldquo;I had forgotten that I was not alone; but you will
  excuse me. In truth, I can bear this state of suspense no longer, and intend
  to set forth for Worcester to- morrow, and ascertain, if I can, the fate of
  my son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But consider the risk you will run, my good sir,&rdquo; mildly
  objected Mr. Beard; &ldquo;and how unfit you are for such a
  journey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfit I am for it, I well know,&rdquo; the colonel rejoined,
  mournfully; &ldquo;and like enough the effort may kill me, but I may as well
  go as tarry here, and die by inches. However, I will take counsel of one who
  can best guide me in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, take counsel of Heaven ere you decide, sir,&rdquo; the
  clergyman said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My counsellor is in heaven,&rdquo; the colonel returned.
  &ldquo;Lend me your arm, Dulcia. I would fain arise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus called upon, the young maiden instantly flew to his assistance, gave
  him his crutch-handled stick, and helped to raise him from his seat. The old
  Cavalier got up with great difficulty, and his rheumatic pains extorted a
  groan from him. After a momentary stoppage he moved on in the direction of
  his wife&rsquo;s portrait, halting opposite to it. Dulcia, who still
  supported him, watched his proceedings with some surprise, but she made no
  remark. The colonel gazed wistfully at the portrait, and then, in earnest and
  supplicating tones, but so low as scarcely to be audible to Dulcia, besought
  his dear departed wife to give him some sign by which he might know whether
  his design met with her approval.</p>

  <p>Filled with wonder at the singularity of the proceeding, Dulcia began to
  fear that grief had turned the old colonel&rsquo;s brain; but she had little
  time for reflection, for scarcely were the words uttered than a noise was
  heard without in the corridor, and the next moment Patty Whinchat, in a state
  of the greatest excitement, and followed by an old serving-man wearing the
  colonel&rsquo;s livery, rushed into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my answer!&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel almost shrieked
  &ldquo;What is it, woman? Speak!&rdquo; he vociferated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! your honour, John Habergeon is come back,&rdquo; responded
  Patty, well-nigh out of breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he come alone?&rdquo; the colonel faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, your honour, no!&rdquo; Martin Geere, the old serving-man,
  cried. &ldquo;The wench has lost her wits. John has brought Master Clavering
  with him, but the young gentleman be in a sorry plight&mdash;a woful, sorry
  plight, for sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he lives! he is safe!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, in a
  transport of delight. &ldquo;Where is my boy? Bring him to me&mdash;bring him
  to me, quick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is here, your honour,&rdquo; responded the sonorous voice of
  John Habergeon from the corridor.</p>

  <p>Heavy footsteps resounded from the passage, and in another instant the old
  trooper appeared, sustaining his young master with his stalwart arm. Leading
  Clavering to the nearest chair, he deposited him within it, with as much
  tenderness and solicitude as could be exhibited by a nurse towards a sick
  man.</p>

  <p>On beholding his son, the colonel uttered a cry, and shaking off in his
  excitement the rigidity of his limbs, and seeking for no support, rushed
  towards him with a quickness which, under other circumstances, would not have
  been possible. Dulcia and Mr. Beard followed, but remained standing at a
  little distance, unwilling to interrupt the meeting between father and son.
  In the meantime, several others of the household, male and female, had
  flocked into the room. These persons, when he had placed his young master in
  the chair, as before related, John Habergeon took upon him to dismiss.</p>

  <p>In good sooth, Clavering Maunsel was in a sorry plight. His apparel was
  soiled and torn; and the jerkin, over which he had worn a corslet on the
  field, was stained with blood. His long dark locks were dishevelled and
  unkempt, as if he had gone bareheaded for days; and such, indeed, was the
  fact. His lineaments were ghastly pale from loss of blood and other
  suffering; and his right arm appeared to be broken, for it was bound up, and
  supported by the very scarf which Dulcia had embroidered for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My boy&mdash;my dear boy! how I joy to see thee back again!&rdquo;
  the old colonel exclaimed, embracing him, and bending over him with effusion.
  &ldquo;I had well-nigh given thee up for lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must thank John Habergeon for bringing me to you,
  father,&rdquo; Clavering replied. &ldquo;Without him, you would never have
  beheld me more. But why come not Dulcia and her honoured father nigh me? I
  long to greet them, but am too much exhausted to rise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus summoned, the young maiden was instantly by his side. Clavering
  extended his uninjured arm towards her, feebly pressing her hand, and fixing
  a tender look upon her, while she remained gazing upon him with tearful eyes.
  The good divine next came in for his share of the wounded man&rsquo;s
  notice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall die content now that I have seen you all once more,&rdquo;
  Clavering cried, in a feeble voice, and half closing his eyes, as he sank
  back in the chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! talk not of dying!&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel exclaimed.
  &ldquo;I tell thee thou shalt live&mdash;live and grow hearty again, and
  shalt carry havoc amongst those canting Roundheads and rebels. I was worse
  hurt at Naseby than thou art, and should speedily have recovered from my
  wounds, had I been properly tended, and not lodged in that pestilent castle
  of Chester, where the prison fever took me and brought me to the gates of
  death, leaving me ever afterward stiff of joint and lame of limb, so that I
  can neither mount horse nor bear sword. But thou shalt get well again in less
  than a month, I warrant thee, Clavering, and be ready once more to fight the
  king&rsquo;s enemies. Thou hast youth and a sound constitution to back thee,
  and need&rsquo;st fear nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He looks very faint!&rdquo; Dulcia exclaimed, anxiously. &ldquo;A
  cup of wine, methinks, would do him good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well thought of, girl,&rdquo; the colonel cried. &ldquo;A cup of
  wine instantly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Captain Clavering is suffering more from weakness and want of
  nourishment than from his wounds,&rdquo; John Habergeon said, filling a
  goblet with sack, and handing it to Dulcia. &ldquo;Give it to him, fair
  mistress,&rdquo; he continued, with a gruff kind of gallantry. &ldquo;The cup
  will taste better from your hands than mine;&rdquo; adding, in a tone
  calculated only for her ear, &ldquo;he hath talked of scarce any one else
  save you since he got his wounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blushing deeply, but taking no notice of this embarrassing whisper, Dulcia
  gave the goblet to Clavering, who looked at her fixedly as he raised it to
  his lips.</p>

  <p>Just then, the groom of the kitchen, Giles Moppett, accompanied by Martin
  Geere and Patty Whinchat, entered the hall, bringing materials for a
  plentiful repast, which they proceeded to place upon the table with all
  possible expedition. Fortunately the larder happened to be well stocked. The
  viands were chiefly of a substantial character&mdash;so much the better, John
  Habergeon thought, as he looked on, almost with a wolfish eye, while the
  dishes were being set upon the board. There was a mountainous roast round of
  beef, a couple of boiled pullets, little the worse for their previous
  appearance at the board, a dish of larks, a huge pigeon-pie, and, better than
  all, the remains of a mangificent roast bustard&mdash;bustards were then to
  be met with on the South Downs. As soon as the arrangements for this
  impromptu supper were completed, Clavering, upon whom the generous liquor he
  had swallowed had produced a very beneficial effect, was borne to the table
  by his father&rsquo;s directions, without moving him from the chair wherein
  he sat. Giles Moppett, who acted as carver, then inquired what his young
  master would be pleased to take; but Clavering refused to touch anything till
  John Habergeon had been served, and bade Moppett fill a plate with roast beef
  for the old trooper. John was far too hungry to be bashful, so he sat down,
  as he was enjoined to do, and speedily cleared his plate, which was promptly
  replenished by Moppett. The old trooper was no indifferent trencherman in a
  general way; but just now he seemed to possess an inexhaustible appetite,
  eating like one half famished. After doing prodigious execution upon the
  round of beef, he devoured a leg and a wing of the bustard&mdash;no trifling
  feat in itself&mdash;only pausing occasionally in his task to empty a flagon
  of nut-brown ale, poured out for him by the attentive Martin Geere. Finally,
  he attacked the pigeon-pie, and soon made a great hole in it. His prowess was
  watched with infinite satisfaction by Colonel Maunsel, who encouraged him to
  go on, repeatedly ordering Giles Moppett to fill his plate anew. At first,
  Clavering ate sparingly and slowly, but as he gained strength his appetite
  increased, and if he could have used both hands, he might, perchance, have
  rivalled John Habergeon&rsquo;s wondrous performances, for he seemed to have
  fasted as long as the old trooper. But notwithstanding his insatiable hunger,
  the young man took good care to call in Dulcia&rsquo;s aid to cut up his meat
  for him, which he was certainly entitled to do, seeing that he could not
  perform the task for himself. A pause, however, in this terrible masticating
  process having at length arrived, on Clavering&rsquo;s side, at
  least&mdash;for John, it seemed, would never cease&mdash;Colonel Maunsel
  thought he might venture to ask for some particulars of his son&rsquo;s
  escape after the battle. The first inquiries however, of the loyal old
  gentleman were, whether Clavering knew aught of the king?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust his Majesty has escaped his enemies, father,&rdquo; the
  young man replied; &ldquo;but I have heard nothing concerning him since I was
  separated from him, in the manner I will proceed to recount to you. After the
  rout on that unlucky day, when all went against us, and the king was
  compelled to retire, I had the honour of forming part of the small escort
  that attended him, having previously assisted, with my Lord Cleveland and
  Colonel Wogan, in covering his retreat from the city. We rode off at
  nightfall in the direction of Stourbridge, his Majesty having decided upon
  taking refuge at Boscobel House, whither Mr. Charles Giffard, than whom there
  breathes not a more loyal gentleman, had undertaken to conduct
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know Charles Giffard well,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel remarked,
  &ldquo;and can avouch, from my personal knowledge, that he is as loyal as
  thou hast described him. I also know Boscobel, and White Ladies, another
  house belonging to the Giffards, and in either place his Majesty would find a
  secure retreat. The king could not be in better hands than those of loyal
  Charles Giffard. But go on, my son; how far didst accompany his
  Majesty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Within a mile of Stourbridge,&rdquo; Clavering replied; &ldquo;when
  we were attacked by a troop of the enemy&rsquo;s horse, and the king was
  exposed to much peril, running great risk of capture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Capture! &lsquo;Sdeath! you would none of you have suffered those
  vile knaves to lay hands on his Majesty&rsquo;s sacred person!&rdquo; the old
  colonel exclaimed, his eye blazing fiercely, and his limbs trembling with
  passion. &ldquo;Oh! that I had been there, with an arm as strong as that
  which I boasted before Naseby! What didst thou do, boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That which you would have done yourself, sir,&rdquo; Clavering
  rejoined. &ldquo;I used your sword to some purpose against the crop-eared
  curs, and made them feel the edge of the weapon. Finding the king beset by
  the captain of the troop and three or four of his men, who had recognized his
  Majesty, and were shouting out &lsquo;that the Lord of Hosts had delivered
  Abijam, the son of Rehoboam, into their hands,&rsquo; and were menacing him
  with death if he did not yield himself up to them, I fired my pistol at the
  head of their leader, and throwing myself upon the others, assailed them so
  furiously, that the king was able to extricate himself from them and get
  clear off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! thou hast been the happy instrument of saving his
  Majesty&rsquo;s life&mdash;thou, my darling son?&rdquo; the old Cavalier
  exclaimed, in tones half broken by the deep emotion which he vainly
  endeavoured to repress. &ldquo;By Saint George! thou hast done well,
  Clavering&mdash;thou hast done well. And if thou hadst perished in the act,
  thou wouldst have died the death which I myself should have most
  coveted&mdash;a death worthy of one of our loyal house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Heaven be praised, my brave young friend is spared to
  us!&rdquo; Mr. Beard ejaculated. &ldquo;May he be preserved to be a prop to
  your declining years, sir,&rdquo; he added to the colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May he be preserved to aid in King Charles&rsquo; restoration, that
  is all I pray for!&rdquo; the old Cavalier exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cry &lsquo;Amen&rsquo; to that prayer, father,&rdquo; the young
  man rejoined, fervently.</p>

  <p>Hitherto Dulcia had abstained from speech, though her cheek had glowed
  during Clavering&rsquo;s narration. She now ventured to remark:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you have more to tell us of that desperate encounter, have you
  not? It was there that you received your hurts?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Dulcia,&rdquo; Clavering replied. &ldquo;His
  Majesty, whom Heaven preserve! had got off as I have informed you, but I
  myself was surrounded, and had a sharp conflict with the base knaves, from
  whom I neither expected to receive quarter, nor would have deigned to accept
  it, and who, moreover, as you may guess, were mightily enraged at the
  king&rsquo;s escape. Ere long my right arm was disabled by the blow of a
  pike, and being thus at the mercy of the murtherous rascals, I should have
  been despatched outright, if it had not been for John
  Habergeon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say not a word about me, captain, I beseech you,&rdquo; the old
  trooper interrupted, looking up with his mouth full of pigeon-pie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I marvelled where John could have been all this while,&rdquo; the
  colonel observed. &ldquo;I thought he could not have been far off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John was by my side, sir,&rdquo; Clavering rejoined. &ldquo;By my
  side, did I say? He was in front&mdash;at the rear&mdash;on the
  right&mdash;at the left&mdash;everywhere warding off blows aimed at me, and
  doing terrible execution upon the rebels. But even John could not save me
  from being thrown from my steed, and trampled under foot by the Roundhead
  troopers, who tried to dash out my brains with their horses&rsquo; heels. The
  stoutness of my casque saved me from their malice, and my breastplate
  protected me from all other harm except some trifling
  bruises&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Call you hurts such as yours trifling, my good young friend?&rdquo;
  the pastor cried. &ldquo;You must needs have a frame of iron to bear such
  injuries, and speak lightly of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fore Heaven! Clavering is as tough as his father,&rdquo; the
  old colonel remarked, smiling complacently; &ldquo;and can bear much knocking
  about. There is nothing like a close headpiece with great cheeks, and a stout
  corslet and cuissarts, if you have the ill luck to be hurled on the ground
  and ridden over. Your well- tempered breastplate stood you in good stead on
  this occasion, boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was much dinted, I promise you, father,&rdquo; Clavering
  replied. &ldquo;Howbeit, I escaped with life, though those caitiff troopers
  declared they would send me to perdition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven open their own eyes and save them from the pit!&rdquo; the
  clergyman ejaculated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, such spawn of Satan deserve not your intercession for them,
  reverend sir,&rdquo; the old Cavalier exclaimed, impetuously. &ldquo;I would
  despatch such devil&rsquo;s servants to their master without an
  instant&rsquo;s scruple. Oh! John, my worthy friend,&rdquo; he added to the
  old trooper, who was still quietly pursuing his meal, as if in no wise
  concerned in Clavering&rsquo;s relation, &ldquo;I estimated thee aright. I
  knew thou wouldst be serviceable to my son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would not have stirred a foot for those cursed Roundhead curs,
  your honour,&rdquo; John Habergeon replied; &ldquo;but I wanted to draw them
  from Captain Clavering as the sole means of saving his life, so I made
  pretence of flight, and the rascals galloped after me. They shot my horse,
  but I got off scathless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a brave fellow, John,&rdquo; the colonel said</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brave, indeed! and trusty as brave!&rdquo; Clavering cried.
  &ldquo;He rescued me from certain destruction. I was unable to stir from the
  spot where I fell, and if those butcherly Roundheads had returned, or others
  of their side had come up and found me lying there and still breathing, they
  would infallibly have knocked out my brains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now to look at dear, good John Habergeon, no one would guess what a
  warm heart he possesses,&rdquo; Dulcia exclaimed. &ldquo;I ever liked him;
  but I knew not his true worth till now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men must not be judged by their exterior, child,&rdquo; Mr. Beard
  said. &ldquo;The sweetest kernel hath sometimes the roughest
  shell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just as the best blade may be found in an ill scabbard,&rdquo; the
  colonel said. &ldquo;John is somewhat harsh of feature, it must be owned, but
  he hath a right honest look. You would never mistake him for a
  Puritan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trow not, your honour, if a real Puritan were nigh,&rdquo; the
  old trooper replied, with a grin. &ldquo;But enough, methinks, has been said
  about me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not half enough,&rdquo; Clavering rejoined. &ldquo;I have not told
  you a tithe of what John did for me, father. When you know all, you will
  comprehend how much gratitude I owe him. He bore me in his arms from the
  scene of strife to a place of safety, where he set my broken arm, and put
  splints, which he himself quickly prepared as well as any surgeon could have
  done, over the fracture, bound up the limb, dressed my bruises, and, this
  done, he again carried me to a barn, where we passed the night, John watching
  by me all the while. After some hours&rsquo; rest I was able to move, and we
  set out before daybreak across the country, as near as we could conjecture in
  the direction of Stratford. We made but slow progress, for I was very stiff
  and weak; but John lent me all the aid he could, cheering me on, and talking
  to me of home and of those I loved, when I was half inclined to lie down in
  despair. As the day advanced, he procured me some milk and bread, without
  which I could no longer have gone on, for I had tasted nothing since the
  previous morn&mdash;the morn, you will remember, of the fatal battle. Having
  partaken of this food, I was enabled to continue my journey, and ere night we
  had found shelter in a thicket between Stratford and Long Marston, when John
  left me for a while to procure fresh provisions for our support. The faithful
  fellow came back, bringing with him meat and a bottle of stout ale; but
  though half famished, he would touch nothing himself till I had eaten and
  drunk. But I must be brief, for this talking is too much for me. During the
  whole of our toilsome journey hither, exposed as we have been to constant
  hazard from the Republican troops which are scouring the country in every
  direction, dreading almost to show our faces lest we should be set upon by
  some Roundhead churls, resting now in a wood, now beneath a haystack, but
  never under a roof, obtaining food with difficulty, and the little we got of
  the coarsest kind&mdash;during all these difficulties and dangers, my trusty
  companion, who might easily have provided for his own safety, kept ever by my
  side, and tended me, cheered me, watched over me&mdash;nay, actually in two
  instances saved me from capture with his good right hand, for I could do
  nothing in my own defence&mdash;and finally succeeded in bringing me home in
  safety.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessings upon him for his noble conduct!&rdquo; the clergyman
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, blessings upon him!&rdquo; reiterated both the colonel and
  Dulcia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it is all right now, since I am back again at the dear old
  house,&rdquo; Clavering continued. &ldquo;As to my wounds, I heed them not.
  They will soon heal. But the thought of how I got them will last during the
  rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a true Maunsel, every inch of thee, Clavering,&rdquo; his
  father cried, in approval. &ldquo;What signifies a limb lost, or a drop of
  blood the less in one&rsquo;s veins, if we have done good service to the
  royal cause. And thou hast saved the king&rsquo;s life. Think of
  that&mdash;think of that, Clavering Maunsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do think of it,&rdquo; the young Cavalier replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I crave your honour&rsquo;s leave to propose a toast,&rdquo; John
  Habergeon cried, rising.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast my full licence to do so,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel
  rejoined. &ldquo;Fill thine own glass from that flask of Malvoisie to the
  brim, and all of us will follow thine example. Even fair Mistress Dulcia will
  not refuse thy pledge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, that I will not, in good sooth, colonel,&rdquo; Dulcia
  cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will all do me reason, I am sure, when you hear my
  toast,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;A health to King Charles, and may God
  preserve him from his enemies!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All arose; the colonel unassisted, for his new-found activity had not yet
  deserted him; and Clavering contrived to get up from his chair. The glasses
  being filled, the toast was drunk by the whole company, including even
  Dulcia, who raised the goblet to her lips. Colonel Maunsel repeated the words
  pronounced by the loyal old trooper with great fervour and solemnity; adding,
  &ldquo;I will put a rider to thy toast, John, and drink to his
  Majesty&rsquo;s speedy restoration.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While the party was thus occupied, none of them were aware that their
  proceedings were watched from the bay-window on the left by a sallow-faced,
  sinister-looking personage, habited in a Geneva cloak and bands, and wearing
  a tall steeple-crowned hat on his head. We have said that this spy was
  unobserved by all the party; but his presence did not pass unnoticed by the
  quick eyes of Patty Whinchat, who entered the hall just as the treasonable
  toast (for such it would sound in the ears of a Republican) had been
  drunk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; Patty screamed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man at
  the window.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What say&rsquo;st thou, wench? A man at the window!&rdquo; Colonel
  Maunsel cried. &ldquo;Go and see, John. I can discern no one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old trooper did not require bidding twice, but rushed to the
  bay-window indicated by Patty. However, he could perceive nothing to justify
  the girl&rsquo;s alarm, and told the colonel as much.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What manner of man didst fancy thou sawest, wench?&rdquo; the
  colonel cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was no fancy, your honour; I&rsquo;m sure I saw him,&rdquo;
  Patty rejoined. &ldquo;I saw his hatchet-face, and his cat&rsquo;s-eyes, and
  his tall, sugar-loaf hat, and his Geneva cloak and bands&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oons! that should be Increase Micklegift, from thy description,
  wench,&rdquo; the colonel interrupted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was Increase Micklegift whom I beheld,&rdquo; Patty replied.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear to his ugly nose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No occasion for swearing, Patty,&rdquo; the clergyman remarked.
  &ldquo;We will believe your simple affirmation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go and send some one forth, Moppett,&rdquo; the colonel said to the
  groom of the kitchen, &ldquo;to ascertain whether this pestilent rascal be
  indeed within the garden, or elsewhere lurking about the premises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go myself,&rdquo; John Habergeon rejoined; &ldquo;and if
  I catch him, I&rsquo;ll treat him as I would a hen-roost
  plunderer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, harm him not,&rdquo; the clergyman cried; &ldquo;but admonish
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, I&rsquo;ll admonish him, your reverence,&rdquo; John
  Habergeon replied, &ldquo;&mdash;with a cudgel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This incident caused Colonel Maunsel considerable uneasiness, and somewhat
  abated his satisfaction at his son&rsquo;s return. Clavering, he well knew,
  might at any moment be arrested as a traitor to the Commonwealth, for having
  borne arms for his lawful sovereign, and might even suffer death for a
  display of loyalty, which the Rump Parliament regarded in the light of high
  treason. Since Clavering was in this danger, it was necessary that the utmost
  caution should be observed in regard to him; and though the colonel could
  rely upon his household to maintain perfect secrecy as to their young
  master&rsquo;s return, yet if Increase Micklegift had become aware of the
  fact, concealment would be hopeless. Moreover, Colonel Maunsel felt
  satisfied, from his knowledge of the Independent minister&rsquo;s character,
  that he would not hesitate to denounce Clavering.</p>

  <p>These considerations, as we have said, greatly alarmed the old Cavalier;
  but he was somewhat reassured by John Habergeon, who, on his return, after
  some quarter of an hour&rsquo;s absence, declared that he, with Giles Moppett
  and Martin Geere, had carefully searched the garden without finding any
  traces of the supposed spy. But, to make all sure, they had gone up to the
  old rectory, where the Independent minister had taken up his abode since Mr.
  Beard&rsquo;s secession, and knocking at the door, had been answered by
  Increase himself from his chamber window, who bade them be gone about their
  business, and not disturb him at that unseasonable hour of the night.</p>

  <p>This latter piece of information was well calculated to allay the
  colonel&rsquo;s fears, and he began to agree with John Habergeon, that Patty
  Whinchat, in spite of her positive assertions to the contrary, must have been
  mistaken, and could not have beheld the mischievous Independent divine.
  Deeming, therefore, that further precautionary measures were unneeded for the
  night&mdash;whatever might be requisite on the morrow&mdash;he saw his son
  conducted to his chamber by John Habergeon (Clavering&rsquo;s parting with
  Dulcia must be left to the fair reader&rsquo;s imagination), and tarried with
  him for some time, when he himself sought his couch. Long ere this, all the
  other inmates of Ovingdean Grange had retired to rest, happier than they had
  been for many days.</p>

     name="bk2">BOOK II. INCREASE MICKLEGIFT</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch2-1"
     name="ch2-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  Showing That A Chimney May Serve For Other<br>
  Purposes Than As A Passage For Smoke</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DOMICILIARY visits to the residences of country gentlemen
  noted for their fidelity to the Crown were so frequent at the period, that
  almost every house belonging to an adherent to the royal cause was provided
  with a hiding-place, wherein a kinsman, whose proceedings had jeopardized his
  safety, or a fugitive Cavalier, seeking shelter from the foe, might be
  secreted until the danger should have passed by.</p>

  <p>Ovingdean Grange possessed a retreat of this kind, very skilfully
  fabricated amidst the brickwork of a large external chimney at the north-east
  angle of the mansion. No indication of the hiding-place was perceptible from
  without, even on careful examination. The chimney had nothing unusual in its
  shape, though of great size; large chimneys being common enough in old Sussex
  houses, as may be observed in many still in existence. The lurking-place, as
  may be supposed, was extremely contracted in its dimensions, and would just
  hold two persons. Built in juxtaposition with the chimney funnel, it sprang
  to a height sufficient to enable its occupants to stand upright within it.
  Light and air were admitted by a narrow loophole, screened from observation
  by a grotesque stone gargoyle projecting from the roof of the building.
  Access to the spot was of course obtained from within. In a spacious
  bed-chamber at the rear of the house, used by Colonel Maunsel himself, there
  was a large oak chimney-piece, the left jamb of which, carved as a pilaster,
  turned upon a pivot, and could be instantly set in motion by a spring
  concealed amidst the foliage of the capital. On opening this secret door an
  aperture was disclosed large enough to admit a man, and communicating with a
  narrow passage constructed within the thickness of the walls. A second
  obstacle, however, was set in the way of the searchers, should they have
  succeeded in penetrating thus far. Within a couple of yards of the fireplace,
  the passage was blocked up by what seemed solid masonry; but the impediment,
  though apparently insurmountable, could easily be removed by touching a
  second spring. Beyond this, the passage was free, and soon terminated in the
  small chamber already described.</p>

  <p>This hiding-place naturally occurred to Colonel Maunsel, as he lay awake,
  and painfully ruminating, on the night of his son&rsquo;s return to the
  Grange. But though the asylum might be a secure one, in case Clavering should
  be denounced by Increase Micklegift (for the colonel could not wholly shake
  off the apprehension of this possibility), yet recourse must not be had to
  it, except at the last extremity, since the occupation for any length of time
  of such a narrow cell by the young man, in his present wounded and enfeebled
  state, might be productive of most disastrous consequences. The best thing to
  be done, it seemed to the colonel, was to bring Clavering to his own room, so
  that the young man might take instant refuge within the hidden chamber, in
  case the house should be menaced with a perquisition. Fortunately, none of
  the household, except trusty John Habergeon, were acquainted with the
  hiding-place, so that no threats or maltreatment on the part of the searchers
  could extort from them a revelation of the secret.</p>

  <p>All continued tranquil, however, during the night. Worn out with the
  extraordinary fatigue and privations he had undergone, Clavering slept so
  soundly, that if the malevolent Independent minister, accompanied by a dozen
  Roundhead musketeers, had knocked at his door, he would scarce have been
  aroused. John Habergeon, who occupied a truckle-bed in his young
  master&rsquo;s room, slept soundly too, but the old trooper had the vigilance
  of a watchdog, and would have been up, and on the alert, on the slightest
  disturbance. A pair of pistols lay within his reach, in case of a
  surprise.</p>

  <p>Long before daybreak, Colonel Maunsel, who had slept but little, as we
  have stated, arose, and wrapping himself in a dressing-gown, took a taper,
  which burnt within his chamber, and proceeded to inspect the hiding-place.
  Both the secret springs acted perfectly, and the cell seemed as dry and
  comfortable as such a place could well be; indeed, its contiguity to the
  chimney funnel kept it warm. Still it must be fitted up yet more conveniently
  for Clavering&rsquo;s reception. Fraught with this resolve, and in order that
  no time might be lost, the colonel repaired at once to his son&rsquo;s room,
  marvelling within himself, as he went, that he was able to move about in this
  way without assistance. But strength seemed to have been given him for the
  perilous conjuncture. John Habergeon started up as he entered the room, and
  the first impulse of the old trooper was to seize the pistols lying beside
  him, but he instantly laid down the weapons on recognizing the intruder.
  Colonel Maunsel desired him, in a low tone, to come with him, and John having
  huddled on his garments as expeditiously as he could, they quitted the room
  together, without disturbing the wounded sleeper. Acting under the
  colonel&rsquo;s directions, John placed a variety of articles within the
  cell, likely to be required by Clavering, if he should be forced to occupy
  it; and these arrangements being satisfactorily made, and the secret door
  restored to its customary position, the old trooper looked at his master, as
  if awaiting further orders, and receiving none, he observed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A plan has just occurred to me for deceiving the enemy, which, with
  your honour&rsquo;s permission, I would fain put into execution without
  delay. For my own part, I believe it was a false alarm that we got last
  night; but I may be wrong, and any way we ought to be cautious where Captain
  Clavering&rsquo;s liberty and life are concerned. My notion is to make
  pretence of quitting the house before daybreak, so that if Increase
  Micklegift, or any other scoundrelly spy like him, should be lurking about
  the premises&mdash;as may be the case, for aught we can tell&mdash;he may
  fancy the captain has taken flight in reality. If your honour thinks well of
  the scheme, I&rsquo;ll hie to the stables at once, and saddle a couple of
  horses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy stratagem is good,&rdquo; the colonel interrupted; &ldquo;but I
  dare not adopt it. My son is too weak to ride forth at this hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend he should, your honour,&rdquo; John Habergeon
  rejoined. &ldquo;I should be loth to disturb the captain from such a slumber
  as he hath not enjoyed since he quitted Worcester; but there is no occasion
  for that. Martin Geere shall be the young gentleman&rsquo;s representative,
  and with one of your honour&rsquo;s cloaks wrapped round him, and one of your
  honour&rsquo;s hats upon his head, Martin will play the part indifferent
  well, especially as there won&rsquo;t be light enough to observe him very
  narrowly. My object is not merely to delude the enemy, but to persuade the
  household that Captain Clavering is gone. It is safest to keep those
  talkative women-folk in the dark. I can rely upon old Martin&rsquo;s silence
  and discretion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, I doubt not Martin may be depended upon,&rdquo; the colonel
  remarked. &ldquo;But whither will you go? What will you do with the
  horses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t ride far, your honour,&rdquo; John replied.
  &ldquo;I will make clatter enough before the rectory for Increase Micklegift
  to hear us, and a word or two roared out as we pass will satisfy the rascally
  preacher it is no other than Captain Clavering whom I have with me. This
  done, we will gallop off in the direction of Brightelmstone, and when fairly
  out of hearing we will manage to steal back, unobserved, over the
  downs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A rare plan, i&rsquo; faith!&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel exclaimed.
  &ldquo;Thou hast a ready wit, John. About it at once, and success attend
  thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>John then departed on his errand, and Colonel Maunsel once more betook
  himself to his son&rsquo;s chamber.</p>

  <p>Clavering was still buried in profound sleep, and while gazing on the
  young man&rsquo;s pale and toil-worn features, and thinking how necessary
  rest was to him the colonel had scarcely the heart to deprive him of it. So
  he sat down by the couch.</p>

  <p>How many anxious thoughts passed through the fond father&rsquo;s breast as
  he gazed upon his sleeping boy. Clavering was the only being upon whom his
  affections were centred. To lose him again as soon as found would be fearful
  indeed. So terrified was the kind-hearted gentleman by the thought of such a
  disaster, that he knelt down and prayed Heaven to avert it.</p>

  <p>Much comforted, he arose and resumed his seat by the bedside. Presently
  the sleeper&rsquo;s lips moved, as if he were essaying to speak, and his
  sire, bending towards him, heard him distinctly pronounce the name of Dulcia.
  Slight as was the circumstance, it confirmed a suspicion which the old
  Cavalier had begun of late to entertain, that a mutual attachment subsisted
  between the young folk; and the certitude of the fact was by no means
  agreeable to him. Extremely partial to Dulcia, entertaining, moreover, a
  sincere respect and esteem for her worthy father, Colonel Maunsel was yet a
  very proud man, and never contemplating such a union for his son as might
  here take place, would infallibly have refused to sanction it.</p>

  <p>However, this was not a moment wherein to trouble himself with so light a
  matter&mdash;light, at all events, he deemed it in comparison with the
  serious considerations before him&mdash;so he dismissed the subject from his
  mind. Indeed, he had little time for reflection. The hour had advanced. Ere
  long the household would be astir, and it was needful to awaken Clavering, in
  pursuance of his plan.</p>

  <p>The heavy chains of slumber in which the young man was bound did not yield
  to the colonel&rsquo;s first attempt to break them; neither, on opening his
  eyes, did Clavering appear to be conscious where he was, nor who was near
  him. Calling out fiercely that he would never yield with life to a rascally
  Roundhead, he commanded his father to take his hands from off him; but
  immediately perceiving his error, he became silent, while the colonel in a
  few words explained his intentions.</p>

  <p>On this Clavering arose, and, attiring himself with his sire&rsquo;s aid,
  accompanied the latter to his chamber.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-2"
     name="ch2-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  What Passed Between The Independent Minister<br>
  And Dulcia In The Churchyard</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was now peep of day. The summit of the eastern downs
  glistened in the early sunbeams, though the nearer slopes still remained grey
  and sombre. Thinking that the fresh morning air would revive him, Colonel
  Maunsel drew aside the window curtains, and throwing open the casement,
  looked forth upon the garden. Animate nature was just beginning to feel the
  quickening influence of the God of Day. The garrulous occupants of the higher
  trees made the welkin ring with their cawing as they flew past in quest of
  their morning meal; lesser birds twittered amongst the boughs; the mavis
  burst from the holm-tree to dispute the first worm upon the grass-plot with
  the intrusive starling; pigeons were circling around the house, or alighting
  on the roof; lowings of oxen and other noises resounded from the farm-yard;
  and the tinkling of the sheep-bell was heard on the adjacent down, where
  might be seen the fleecy company, just released from the fold, in charge of
  the shepherd, and looking as grey as the turf on which they browsed.</p>

  <p>At such an hour, and on a spot which ought to have been sacred from
  intrusion, the presence of an enemy was as unexpected as unwelcome. Yet as
  the colonel&rsquo;s eye wandered over the garden, now resting upon one
  object, now on another, he fancied he saw a dark figure pass quickly by an
  arched opening in an avenue of clipped yew-trees. The noise of stealthy
  footsteps at the same moment reached his ear, convincing him that he was not
  deceived. Hastily withdrawing from the window, he took up a position enabling
  him to command this portion of the garden, while it did not expose him to
  observation. As he thus watched, a head was protruded from the end of the
  alley nearest the house, but it was so suddenly withdrawn that he could not
  tell to whom it belonged.</p>

  <p>After waiting for several minutes without perceiving anything further of
  the owner of the head, the colonel turned to mention the circumstance to his
  son, and then found that Clavering, overcome by weariness, had thrown
  himself, dressed as he was, upon the bed, and was once more wrapped in
  slumber. Not caring to wake him, the brave old gentleman took up his sword
  and was on the point of descending to the garden, when a tap was heard at the
  door, and John Habergeon entered the room.</p>

  <p>On learning what had occurred, John tarried not a second, but, flying down
  stairs, made the best of his way to the yew-tree avenue; the colonel looking
  on all the while from the window. John, however, started no spy from the
  covert, and only disturbed a pair of blackbirds in his search. Nevertheless,
  he extended his investigations, as far as he judged prudent, in the direction
  of the parsonage house, but with an equally fruitless result, and he was
  obliged to return to his master without any intelligence respecting the
  intruder. The old Cavalier was much troubled. That some one had been lurking
  within the garden he felt sure, for he could not doubt the evidence of his
  senses; and that this person came with no friendly intent was equally
  manifest. Danger, therefore, was to be apprehended, and must be the more
  carefully guarded against, inasmuch as its designs were secret.</p>

  <p>John then related what he had done. According to his own belief, his
  stratagem had been perfectly successful. Old Martin Geere having been
  disguised in the manner arranged, the pair rode slowly up the hill-side by
  the rectory, and when close to the house, John halted for a moment to
  vociferate an adieu to the Independent minister, and was well pleased to hear
  a window suddenly opened, and to perceive the reverend gentleman with a
  nightcap on his head, look out at them. Rating them for a couple of drunken
  malignants, and declaring that Satan was at their heels, and would assuredly
  trip them up ere they had proceeded far on their journey, Increase might have
  favoured them with a still longer harangue, but that John interrupted him
  with a roar of derisive laughter, and pushed on after his companion. John and
  old Martin then crossed the hill, and, shaping their course in a northerly
  direction up the valley as if bound for Falmer, got round to the Rottingdean
  road, and so over the down to the little thicket at the back of the Grange,
  where Martin dismounted, and John, taking both horses to the stables, called
  up the groom and his helpmate, leading them to suppose that their young
  master was gone. Not having encountered any one during the ride, John had
  persuaded himself that his return to the stables was unnoticed, until the
  incident in the garden made him fear that his supposition might not be
  altogether correct. He now naturally enough concluded, that Increase
  Micklegift, suspecting an attempt to dupe him, had stolen down to the Grange
  to satisfy himself of the truth. If so, he could have learnt little. The wary
  measures taken were sufficient to mislead him. Such was the conclusion
  arrived at both by the colonel and John. But they agreed, that the utmost
  caution must be observed while they were watched by an enemy so wily as the
  preacher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It vexes me much to think that I cannot send for a surgeon to
  attend upon my son,&rdquo; the colonel said. &ldquo;There is Master Ingram of
  Lewes, a man well skilled in his profession, or Ralph Hoathleigh of
  Brightelmstone, or even old Isaac Woodruff of Rottingdean&mdash;any one of
  them would do; but I dare not trust them. Besides, it would excite suspicion
  if a surgeon were sent for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No need to send for one, your honour,&rdquo; the old trooper
  replied. &ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s wounds are in a fair way of healing, and
  his broken bones have already begun to knit together. He only wants rest and
  good nursing to set him up again, and he is sure of the latter, with me and
  gentle Mistress Dulcia to attend upon him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dulcia!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, looking at him fixedly.
  &ldquo;Why should she come nigh him? Saidst thou not, erewhile, that it would
  be safest not to let the women-folk into the secret, lest they should
  blab?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, marry did I,&rdquo; John rejoined; &ldquo;but I did not include
  Mistress Dulcia amongst the tattlers. Heaven forbid! She is discretion
  itself, and would never breathe a word to jeopardize the captain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; the colonel ejaculated. &ldquo;At all events, she
  shall not nurse my son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t answer for his cure,&rdquo; John answered,
  gruffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so loud, I prithee, John. Thou wilt awake him. By Heaven, he
  opes his eyes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then acquaint him with your resolve.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is&rsquo;t, my father?&rdquo; Clavering cried, from the
  couch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His honour the colonel deems it expedient that during your
  confinement to this chamber, you should be solely under my care, captain; as
  if you had not had enough of an old trooper&rsquo;s rough nursing, and stood
  not in need of gentler care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I am to be deprived of Dulcia&rsquo;s society, I will not remain
  here,&rdquo; Clavering exclaimed, springing from the couch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told your honour how it would be,&rdquo; John cried,
  chuckling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art in league against me, rascal,&rdquo; the colonel
  ejaculated, shaking his hand at him. &ldquo;And as to thee, Clavering, thou
  art a wilful and undutiful boy. A soldier should have a soldier&rsquo;s
  attendance merely. But since thou art so weak and womanish that none save
  Dulcia will serve thy turn to watch over thee and tend thee, even be it as
  thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get well as quickly as thou canst, that is all I ask.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your honour hath ta&rsquo;en the best way to ensure that
  object,&rdquo; John observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold thy peace!&rdquo; the colonel cried. &ldquo;Within yon closet
  thou wilt find all thou needest to perfect his cure: unguents of great
  virtue, sovran balsams, cordials, and an elixir prepared for me by my worthy
  friend Sir Kenelm Digby, which ought to call back the vital spark if it were
  on the eve of departure. Use what thou wilt; but mark me! if thy patient gets
  not well speedily, I&rsquo;ll send for Master Ingram.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I shall be myself again in less than a week,&rdquo; Clavering
  cried. &ldquo;I am stronger already, and with the prospect of such
  attendance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, I say!&rdquo; his father cried. &ldquo;I have heard reasons
  enow, and have yielded against my better judgment. Aid me to attire
  myself,&rdquo; he added to John, &ldquo;and then I will leave my son master
  of the room. Thou wilt have to be groom of the chamber, as well as
  head-nurse, John, for none of the household will come nigh ye, except old
  Martin Geere. And now, give me my hose and doublet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At a somewhat later hour in the morning, though still comparatively early,
  Colonel Maunsel was joined in the library, whither he had repaired on going
  down stairs, by Mr. Beard and Dulcia, both of whom were under the impression
  that Clavering was gone; and one of them, at least, was much relieved by
  finding that such was not the case.</p>

  <p>A bell having been rung for prayers, the greater part of the household
  assembled at the summons, and the clergyman read a portion of the Holy
  Scriptures to them; after which he knelt down, and the rest following his
  example, he offered up an extempore prayer for the preservation from all
  danger of the lord of the mansion and his son. All joined fervently in this
  supplication, but none more so than Dulcia.</p>

  <p>Their devotions ended, the old Cavalier and his guests proceeded to the
  hall and partook of breakfast. Martin Geere was in attendance at the meal,
  which was of a substantial character, according to the habits of the period,
  and the colonel, when he could do so without observation, privily despatched
  him upstairs with a supply of eatables for his son. No mystery was made about
  John Habergeon, since his return was known to the household, and the old
  trooper could take care of himself in the buttery.</p>

  <p>Breakfast over, Dulcia and her father rose to depart, when the colonel,
  calling the latter to him, said, in a low tone, &ldquo;Go upstairs, child, to
  Clavering. Your society will cheer him, and help to while away the tedious
  hours of his captivity. You will find him in my chamber with John Habergeon.
  Be cautious, and, above all, arouse not Patty Whinchat&rsquo;s
  suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dulcia blushingly withdrew, and Colonel Maunsel soon afterwards got up and
  repaired to the library.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dulcia having retired to her own room, was awaiting a
  favourable opportunity to visit the captive, when she was interrupted by the
  sudden entrance of Patty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve seen him&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen him!&rdquo; gasped
  the handmaiden, who looked pale and terrified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seen whom?&rdquo; Dulcia exclaimed, thinking naturally of
  Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Increase Micklegift, to be sure, madam. Who else could
  frighten me so much? I happened to be in the corridor just now, when he came
  up to me&mdash;how he got there I can&rsquo;t tell!&mdash;and seizing me
  rudely by the arm, uttered these words in my ear: &lsquo;Bid thy young
  mistress come to me without delay. I would speak to her on a matter which
  concerns her nearly. I will tarry for her during the space of one hour,
  within the churchyard. If she comes not within that time, she will ever
  hereafter rue her negligence. Convey my message to her at once.&rsquo; And
  with this he disappeared. I am sure, from his looks, he has some evil design.
  You won&rsquo;t go, of course, madam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I will, Patty,&rdquo; Dulcia replied, after a moment&rsquo;s
  reflection. &ldquo;I have no fear of him. I will go at once, and you shall
  attend me. It may be important to others to ascertain his purpose. Give me my
  hood, child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Approving of her young mistress&rsquo;s spirit, Patty made no further
  remonstrance, and Dulcia having quickly attired herself for the walk, the two
  young women left the room, crossed the entrance-hall without stoppage, passed
  out at the front porch, and proceeded towards the church.</p>

  <p>As they advanced, they saw the dark figure of the Independent divine
  within the churchyard. Increase Micklegift had an austere and somewhat
  ill-favoured countenance, but his features, though large and harsh, were by
  no means devoid of intelligence. His eyes were dark and restless, and his
  singularly pale complexion contrasted forcibly with his coal-black hair,
  which was cropped close as the skin of a mole. He was attired in the garb of
  a Puritan preacher, and wore the tall sugar-loaf hat which Patty had remarked
  at the window on the previous night. In age Micklegift might be about thirty,
  and his person was tall and thin, but extremely muscular. On seeing the two
  damsels approach, he advanced slowly to meet them, and making a grave
  salutation to Dulcia, said to Patty, &ldquo;Tarry by the gate, maiden, until
  thy mistress shall return to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He then signed to Dulcia to follow him, and walked on in silence until
  they turned the angle of the church, and drew near the entrance-porch, when
  he stood still. Patty&rsquo;s inquisitive disposition might have led her to
  creep stealthily after them, if she had not observed a man suddenly spring
  over the wall on the north of the churchyard, and make his way cautiously
  round the tower of the sacred edifice. Patty suppressed the scream that rose
  to her lips on discovering that this individual was John Habergeon.</p>

  <p>Having come to a halt, as related, Micklegift said, in a supplicatory
  tone, while a flush overspread his pale features, &ldquo;Hearken unto me,
  maiden. Ever since I set eyes upon thee, my heart hath yearned towards thee.
  Thy charms have been a snare unto me, in which I have fallen. Yet though I
  have burnt with love for thee, I have not ventured to declare my passion, for
  I have perceived that I am an object of aversion in thy sight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forbear this discourse, sir,&rdquo; Dulcia cried, &ldquo;or you
  will drive me away from you instantly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Despise me not, but pity me, maiden,&rdquo; implored the preacher.
  &ldquo;My love for thee is as a tormenting fire which consumes my very
  vitals. It disorders my brain, and drives me to the verge of madness. Have
  compassion upon me! I will be thy slave&mdash;anything thou wilt have me
  be&mdash;if thou wilt but love me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will hear no more,&rdquo; Dulcia said, turning to depart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall hear me out,&rdquo; Micklegift cried, changing his tone
  to one of menace, and seizing her arm. &ldquo;Love, like mine, unrequited,
  makes a man desperate. Another has possession of your heart; but he shall not
  be an obstacle in my path. The malignant Clavering Maunsel is concealed in
  his father&rsquo;s house. I know it. It is vain to attempt denial with me.
  The life of this traitor to the Commonwealth is in my power. I can denounce
  him at any moment, and I will denounce him, if you continue
  inflexible.&rdquo; After a moment&rsquo;s pause, during which he watched the
  impression he had made upon her, he went on: &ldquo;Not only is Clavering
  Maunsel&rsquo;s life in my power, but a word from me will consign your father
  to a prison, where he may rot unheeded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And have you the heart to act thus against those who have never
  offended you, inhuman man? Have some pity for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have no pity for me, damsel. You care not how much I suffer.
  Now hear my fixed determination. Either consent to become my wife, or I will
  use the means of vengeance placed in my hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me till to-morrow for consideration,&rdquo; Dulcia
  replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will grant the time you require, on your solemn promise that you
  will neither give warning to Clavering, nor mention aught that has passed
  between us to your father, or to any other person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I give the promise you exact,&rdquo; she rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough. To-morrow I shall expect your answer&mdash;here, at the
  same hour. Till then, farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Released from his gripe, the terrified damsel instantly made her
  escape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am bound by no promise, villain,&rdquo; muttered John Habergeon,
  who was ensconced behind the angle of the church tower, and had heard all
  that had passed, &ldquo;and I will take means to defeat thy black
  design.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-3"
     name="ch2-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  Some Of The Vexations Experienced By A Royalist<br>
  Gentleman At The Time Of The Commonwealth</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A TROUBLESOME day was in store for Colonel Maunsel. He was
  in the library, seated in an easy-chair, meditating upon the &ldquo;Eikon
  Basilike,&rdquo; when Martin Geere entered, and, with a perturbed
  countenance, informed him that a state- messenger was without, and desired
  instant speech with him. The visit boded the colonel no good, but he ordered
  the man to be admitted. The messenger, however, did not wait for permission
  to present himself, but followed close upon Martin. He was a tall,
  stern-looking man, having the appearance of a soldier, and carried a long
  sword by his side and a pair of large pistols in his belt. He made no
  salutation to the colonel, neither did he attempt to remove his broad- leaved
  hat from off his close-cropped head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou with me, thou unmannerly fellow?&rdquo; the old
  Cavalier demanded, eyeing him with great displeasure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hadst best show some respect to my order, though thou showest
  none to me,&rdquo; the man coldly rejoined, taking a parchment from his
  girdle. &ldquo;Be it known to thee, Wolston Maunsel, somewhile colonel in the
  service of the Man Charles Stuart, that by virtue of this order from the
  Council of State, thou art confined and restricted, on pain of imprisonment,
  within a limit of five miles of thine own dwelling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed. &ldquo;Confined within a range
  of five miles!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The limit is large enough for a dangerous and plotting malignant
  like thee,&rdquo; the messenger rejoined. &ldquo;See thou exceed it not. But
  I have yet more to declare unto thee. Forasmuch as thy son, Clavering
  Maunsel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! what of him?&rdquo; the colonel cried, unable to conceal his
  agitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;being charged with high treason against the Commonwealth,
  and a warrant having been issued for his apprehension, in order that he may
  be brought before a court-martial, in virtue of a commission from his
  Excellency General Cromwell, this is to give thee notice, that if thou shalt
  harbour thy said son Clavering, or lend him aid so that he escape, and the
  ends of justice be thereby defeated, thou thyself, and any of thy house who
  may act under thee, will incur the penalties of high treason. Thou art
  warned, and a like warning will be delivered to thy whole house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, the man strode towards the colonel, laid down the parchment on
  the table before him, and, turning on his heel, departed.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel remained for some time, half stupefied, with his gaze
  fixed upon the warrant. At length he took it up, and after glancing at it,
  dashed it down with a burst of passion. His wrath, however, gave way to
  feelings of alarm, when he learnt from old Martin Geere that, prior to his
  departure, the state-messenger had collected the household together, and
  informed them that if they aided in concealing their young master, now or
  hereafter, they would be severely punished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your honour need have no fear,&rdquo; the faithful old fellow
  said. &ldquo;They all believe the captain is gone; but if they knew he was
  hidden in the house, they would endure torture rather than betray
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this juncture Mr. Beard entered the library, and learning what had
  occurred, besought his patron not to be cast down, but to place his reliance
  upon that Power which had delivered him from so many difficulties and
  dangers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is my son&rsquo;s safety that concerns me most,&rdquo; the old
  Cavalier groaned. &ldquo;So he escape, I care not what becomes of me. But,
  &lsquo;sdeath!&rdquo; he cried, breaking out into fresh fury. &ldquo;I should
  never have desired to quit my own domain, if the tyrannous Council had not
  made me a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He then paced to and fro within the room for some minutes, exclaiming,
  with much bitterness, &ldquo;By Heaven! it is intolerable to be insulted thus
  in one&rsquo;s own house. O what a land we live in! Everything seems at sixes
  and sevens. All honourable usages are at an end. Respect for age and station
  is gone. Fanaticism and hypocrisy usurp the place of religion and virtue, and
  he is esteemed the godliest man who can dissemble most, and best put on a
  sanctimonious visage and demeanour. Out on the pestilent knaves who have thus
  abolished all that was good in the country, and set up all that is
  bad&mdash;a low- born crew who would grind down all to their own base
  level!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet there are some good men among them, honoured sir,&rdquo; Mr.
  Beard observed, &ldquo;who have been influenced by worthy motives, and by
  love of their country, in what they have done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I marvel to hear you say so, sir,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined.
  &ldquo;Were the motives worthy of those bloody butchers who slaughtered their
  virtuous king? Are their motives worthy who have overthrown our Established
  Church, and set up the National Covenant in its stead? Are their motives
  worthy who persecute and despoil, outrage and insult in every way all those
  who have shown loyalty and devotion to their king, and zeal for the
  country&rsquo;s welfare? Out upon them, I say!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can make every allowance for your warmth, honoured sir, for you
  have much to move you to indignation,&rdquo; the good clergyman said;
  &ldquo;but I would not have you blind to the truth. Faults there have been in
  high places beyond doubt&mdash;grievous faults&mdash;else had not those who
  filled them been cast down. Deeply must the princes and mighty ones of the
  land have sinned, or the Lord would not have visited them so severely with
  His displeasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have caught the general infection, sir,&rdquo; the old
  Cavalier observed, sarcastically, &ldquo;and speak as by the mouth of
  Increase Micklegift.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I speak according to my conviction, my honoured patron, and I speak
  the more boldly, because I am well assured that it is only by acknowledgment
  of our errors, and resolution of amendment for the future, that we can turn
  aside Heaven&rsquo;s wrath from against us. Such men as Cromwell are
  instruments of divine displeasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Name him not,&rdquo; cried the colonel, vehemently; &ldquo;or name
  him as the arch- hypocrite, the regicide and parricide that he is. But you
  are right. We must have deeply sinned, or we could not have been yielded to
  the dominion of such as Cromwell. O England! when will thy days of gloom be
  over?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When her offences are expiated,&rdquo; the clergyman rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Merry England men were wont to style thee when I was
  younger,&rdquo; the colonel said, in a mournful tone; &ldquo;but merry thou
  art no longer. Melancholy England were nearer the mark; sour England;
  distracted England; the England of Noll Cromwell and the saints. Heaven
  defend me from such a ruler, and such saints! Hearty, joyous, laughter-loving
  England thou art not. Men smile no longer within thy cities. Gaiety is
  punished as a crime, and places of pleasant resort are forbidden to thy
  youth. Upon thy broad breast sits the night-hag Puritanism, scaring away thy
  dreams of happiness, and filling thee with terrors. It is ill with thee,
  England. Wrong hath become right within thee&mdash;loyalty,
  treason&mdash;religion, an offence. Heaven grant thee a speedy deliverance
  from the wretched thraldom in which thou art placed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not despair of England, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Beard remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined&mdash;&ldquo;when
  Noll Cromwell shall be overthrown, and the monarchy restored. But, till that
  consummation arrives, I am much tempted to exile myself from her
  shores.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here Martin Geere presented himself again, and with new terror imprinted
  upon his countenance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed. &ldquo;I
  guess from thy looks that thou bring&rsquo;st fresh tidings of
  ill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bring no good news, in sooth,&rdquo; Martin replied. &ldquo;There
  are two men without who crave admittance to your honour&mdash;crave, did I
  say?&mdash;nay, they insolently demand it. One of them is Thomas Sunne, the
  Brightelmstone deputy of the Committee for the Sequestration of Livings. His
  reverence knows him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too well,&rdquo; Mr. Beard observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The other I take to be a messenger, for he hath a warrant, and
  beareth a truncheon of office.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, and he will use it on thy shoulders, sirrah, if he be kept
  longer here,&rdquo; exclaimed a peremptory voice without.</p>

  <p>And the next moment two personages stepped into the room. The foremost of
  them, who was he that had spoken, was of middle age, short and stout, and was
  somewhat showily attired in a blue doublet and scarlet cloak; the latter
  garment, however, was weather-stained, and had lost much of its original
  brilliancy. His doublet was embroidered with the badge of the
  Goldsmiths&rsquo; Company&mdash;a leopard&rsquo;s head and a covered cup. His
  companion was an elderly man, with a sour, puritanical countenance, clad in
  sad-coloured raiments, and wearing a steeple-crowned hat. Neither of them
  uncovered their heads on entering the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; cried the foremost of the two, clearing his throat to
  enable him to speak more emphatically. &ldquo;It is Wolston Maunsel, I
  surmise, before whom I stand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art in the presence of Colonel Maunsel, thou saucy
  knave,&rdquo; the old Cavalier haughtily rejoined. &ldquo;Who, and what art
  thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not bound to answer the interrogations of a known malignant
  like thee. Nevertheless, I will tell thee that my heathenish name was
  Lawrence Creek, but since I have put off the old man, I am known as Better
  Late than Never, a saintly designation, and one becoming an elder, like
  myself. I am an emissary unto thee, O Wolston Maunsel, from the Commissioners
  of Goldsmiths&rsquo; Hall, in Foster-lane, London, to whom, as thou knowest,
  thy forfeiture to the State hath been assigned, to summon thee to appear
  before the said commissioners within ten days to pay two hundred pounds for
  thy five-and-twentieth part of the fine which hath been set upon
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My fine hath been fully discharged,&rdquo; the colonel said.
  &ldquo;I have already paid the commissioners five thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is no concern of mine,&rdquo; the other rejoined. &ldquo;Thou
  must appear before them to explain matters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A pest upon thee!&rdquo; the old Cavalier angrily ejaculated.
  &ldquo;Thou art enough to drive a man distraught. I cannot stir hence. I have
  just received an order from the Council prohibiting me, on pain of
  imprisonment, from going more than five miles from home. Here is the warrant.
  Read it, and satisfy thyself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is no concern of mine,&rdquo; the emissary replied, declining to
  look at the warrant. &ldquo;I shall leave the order with thee. Neglect to
  obey it at thy peril.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And, as he spoke, he placed a scroll on the table, and drew back a few
  paces, while the second individual stepped forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My business is with thee, Ardingly Beard,&rdquo; this personage
  said. &ldquo;Thou knowest that I have been appointed, together with my
  colleague, Thomas Geere of Ovingdean, brother to Martin Geere, who still
  continues in the service of the dangerous malignant, Wolston
  Maunsel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad my brother Tom hath had the grace not to present himself
  before his honour,&rdquo; Martin remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thomas Geere was once one of my flock,&rdquo; Mr. Beard observed,
  sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hath seen the error of his ways,&rdquo; Sunne rejoined.
  &ldquo;But, as I was about to say, thou knowest that he and I have been
  appointed by the Committee for the Sequestration of Livings to collect,
  gather, and receive the tithes, rents, and profits of the benefice of the
  church of Ovingdean, now under sequestration, and to provide for its care.
  Thou knowest also how we have applied those profits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have some guess,&rdquo; the clergyman observed. &ldquo;Partly to
  your own use, partly in payment of Increase Micklegift.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wholly in payment of that godly divine,&rdquo; Thomas Sunne
  rejoined. &ldquo;Now give heed to what I say unto thee, Ardingly Beard. It is
  suspected that thou continuest secretly to perform the rites and services of
  thy suppressed church. Take heed, therefore. If the offence be proved against
  thee, thou shalt pay with thy body for thy contumacy. A year&rsquo;s
  imprisonment in Lewes Castle will teach thee submission.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven grant thee a more Christian spirit, friend,&rdquo; the
  clergyman meekly rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friend, quotha! I am no friend of prelatists and
  covenant-breakers,&rdquo; the other rejoined. &ldquo;Wilt thou take the
  National Covenant?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly not,&rdquo; Mr. Beard replied, firmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Begone both of ye!&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel cried, losing all
  patience, &ldquo;and rid my house of your hateful presence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had best lay hands upon us, Wolston Maunsel,&rdquo; the
  emissary from Goldsmiths&rsquo; Hall cried, in a taunting and insolent tone.
  &ldquo;I should like nothing better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Thomas Sunne added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be patient, I implore of you, honoured sir,&rdquo; the clergyman
  cried, &ldquo;and let them go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show them forth, Martin, or I shall do them a mischief,&rdquo; the
  colonel cried. Whereupon the two men withdrew, muttering threats, however, as
  they departed.</p>

  <p>As soon as he and Mr. Beard were left alone, Colonel Maunsel gave vent to
  a fresh explosion of rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perdition seize these Roundhead miscreants!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
  &ldquo;They have set me upon the horns of a dilemma. How am I to fulfil such
  contradictory orders? Here is one that tells me I must not stir from home;
  another, commanding me to come to London. If I obey one, I must perforce
  neglect the other; and, for my own part, I am well disposed to pay respect to
  neither.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I scarce know how to counsel you, honoured sir,&rdquo; the
  clergy-man rejoined. &ldquo;Truly, it is a most embarrassing position in
  which you are placed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is more embarrassing than you deem, reverend sir,&rdquo; the
  colonel returned. &ldquo;I have not wherewithal to pay the fine imposed upon
  me, and must borrow the two hundred pounds, at heavy usance, from old Zachary
  Trangmar, the money- lender of Lewes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am grieved to hear it, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Beard observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These bloodsuckers will never let me rest till they have utterly
  ruined me,&rdquo; pursued the colonel; &ldquo;and such, I doubt not, is their
  intent. Their aim is to cripple all true men. Heaven confound their
  devices!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; the clergyman ejaculated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well! well! the difficulty must be met, and bravely too,&rdquo; the
  old Cavalier cried&mdash;&rdquo; no tame yielding, or crying for quarter on
  the part of Wolston Maunsel. &ldquo;I will fight the good fight, so long as
  there is breath in my body. I must go forthwith to Lewes&mdash;it is almost
  within my prescribed limits&mdash;and see Zachary Trangmar. I shall have to
  give the extortionate old rascal my bond, for he will not trust the word of a
  gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot become surety for you, honoured sir,&rdquo; the clergyman
  observed; &ldquo;or I would willingly be so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel exclaimed, hastily. &ldquo;The old
  usurer will be content with my own security. Unluckily, it is not the first
  transaction I have had with him. If the knaves go on plundering me in this
  manner, I shall have little, beyond my good name, to leave my son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that will be his fairest inheritance, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Beard
  observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not likely to content him, though,&rdquo; the colonel
  rejoined, with a half laugh. &ldquo;However, we must hope for better days,
  though neither you nor I may live to see them, reverend sir. Meanwhile, we
  must provide for the present. I will ride to Lewes this morning, and Dulcia
  shall accompany me. John Habergeon will watch over Clavering, and will know
  how to act, in case of difficulty. To your charge, good sir, I confide the
  rest of the house during my brief absence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Beard bowed, and the colonel arose, observing, that when he last got
  on horseback, his rheumatism was so bad, that he thought he should never more
  be able to mount steed; but he felt quite equal to the effort now. Summoning
  Martin Geere, he bade him cause a couple of horses to be saddled&mdash;one of
  them for Mistress Dulcia. And seeing the old serving-man stare at the
  unexpected order, he added, &ldquo;The day is fine, and tempts me to take an
  hour&rsquo;s exercise on the downs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your honour hath not ridden for more than two months,&rdquo;
  old Martin stoutly objected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No matter, I mean to ride to-day. See that the horses are got ready
  forthwith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should not have supposed that your honour would like to leave the
  house just now,&rdquo; Martin persisted. &ldquo;How says your reverence? When
  robbers are abroad, it were well, methinks, that the master stayed at home to
  guard his treasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My honoured friend has good reason for what he doth,&rdquo; the
  clergyman replied; &ldquo;and I trust we shall be able to protect the house
  and all within it, during his absence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, then I have nothing more to urge,&rdquo; the old serving-man
  rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hark ye, Martin,&rdquo; the colonel cried, arresting him;
  &ldquo;bid Eustace Saxby, the falconer, hold himself in readiness to go with
  us; and tell him to bring with him the young Barbary falcon and the merlin
  that he hath lately manned and lured, and I will try their flight at a
  partridge. Use despatch, for I shall set forth presently.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk3"
     name="bk3">BOOK III. HAWKING ON THE DOWNS</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch3-1"
     name="ch3-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  The Ostreger And His Son</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HORSE, hawk, and man were at the gate, awaiting the
  colonel&rsquo;s coming forth with Dulcia.</p>

  <p>Stately and upright sat the hawks on the falconer&rsquo;s gloved fist, as
  if conscious of their tufted hoods of crimson and white velvet, their jesses
  and bewets with bells affixed to them, and their silver-linked varvels,
  graven with their owner&rsquo;s armorial bearings. Both birds looked in fine
  condition: plumage glossy and unruffled, legs and talons without speck or
  blemish. Gallant to behold was the Barbary, or tartaret falcon; not
  remarkable in point of size, for it was smaller than a tercel-gentle; but
  specially to be admired for its proud neck, broad breast, fine sails and
  beams, and long train; and, when unhooded, for its keen-bent beak, with barb
  feathers beneath the clap, wide nares, and full black eye. Fierce and
  courageous, also, was the tartaret&rsquo;s companion, the merlin; very nimble
  of wing, and, like the Barbary falcon, armed with strong singles and
  pounces.</p>

  <p>Eustace Saxby, the falconer (or ostreger, as he preferred to be styled),
  was as gallant-looking as the hardy birds on his fist. Clad in a doublet of
  Lincoln- green, with his master&rsquo;s arms embroidered on the shoulder,
  with his upper hose tied with ribbons at the knee, and his feet protected by
  stout leather buskins, he carried in his right hand a tall hawking-pole, and
  was provided with a large hawking-bag, containing coping-irons, knives,
  scissors, creance, and other implements of his craft; together with medicines
  in the shape of mummy-powder, washed aloes, saffron, and casting. Eustace
  Saxby was a strong, well-built man, in the prime of life, with a hard but
  honest-looking physiognomy, of the true Sussex cast. No Puritan he. Abhorring
  a Roundhead as much as his master, Eustace allowed his long locks to flow
  over his shoulders from beneath his green velvet cap, to manifest his
  contempt of the crop-eared curs. When younger, our ostreger had been
  remarkable for activity, and could then walk faster than any man in the
  county, and keep up in running with a horse at full speed; but having now
  grown stiffer in the joints, he was forced to cede the palm of fleetness to
  his son, Ninian.</p>

  <p>Close to the ostreger stood his assistant, Barnaby Lashmere, carrying a
  square wooden frame suspended by broad leather straps from his shoulders. On
  this frame were perched several other hawks, of various kinds, in hoods and
  jesses, in readiness for the colonel, in case he might choose to take any of
  them with him.</p>

  <p>Ninian Saxby, who filled the post of under-falconer, was with his father
  on the present occasion. A very good-looking young fellow of one-and-twenty
  was Ninian, with a fresh complexion, a merry blue eye, and brown curling
  hair. His lithe figure and active limbs seemed made for running and vaulting,
  and he excelled in all manly sports. A rattling tongue had Ninian, as well as
  a bright eye, and his pleasant talk and winning smiles made him a general
  favourite with the village damsels, even with those of a Puritanical turn;
  but his fondness for dancing and other pastimes, gaiety of manner, and light
  discourse, frequently drew upon him the grave rebukes of the elders. Ninian,
  however, cared little for such censure. The young falconer was too
  indiscriminate in his attentions to the damsels generally, and too fickle in
  his regards, to be assigned to any one in particular; but if he had a
  preference, it was supposed to be for Patty Whinchat&mdash;the pretty
  handmaiden herself being decidedly of that opinion. Ninian&rsquo;s
  habiliments resembled those of his father; his green jerkin was vastly
  becoming to him, while his green velvet cap, with a single heron&rsquo;s
  plume in it, placed jauntilyon his curlyhead, suited well with the handsome
  and somewhat saucy features beneath it; giving the wearer quite as much the
  air of a page as of a falconer. Ninian had a bugle slung at his back by a
  green cord, a crossbow over his shoulder, and a case of quarrels with a
  gaffle for bending the bow at his hip. Moreover, he had two fine spaniels,
  coupled together, and in leash, in his charge.</p>

  <p>Falconers, hawks, dogs, horses, and grooms, formed a picturesque group,
  viewed in combination with the ancient mansion, near whose porch they were
  assembled. Amidst the group, old Rupert, Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s favourite
  charger, and as noble a piece of antiquity as the colonel himself, occupied a
  prominent place. Rupert&rsquo;s best days were long past, it is
  true&mdash;and so, alas! were his master&rsquo;s&mdash;but though there were
  unmistakable marks of age about him, he was a fine animal still. There was
  fire in his eye, courage in his arching neck, that told of former mettle.
  Bright bay had been old Rupert&rsquo;s colour, but the hue was now sadly
  changed, and the flanks were dull, which had once shone like satin. He was
  furnished with a large easy saddle, having a high pommel, and a troussequin
  at the hinder bow. A dapple-grey palfrey, with white mane and tail, was
  destined for Dulcia, and this lively, but well-trained little animal, by his
  pawing, champing, and snorting, offered a strong contrast to the sedate
  deportment of the ancient charger.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding his reduced revenue, Colonel Maunsel still managed to keep
  up a large troop of servants of one kind or other. Born upon the estate, most
  of the members of the old Cavalier&rsquo;s establishment were so attached to
  him, that they would never have quitted his service, except upon compulsion.
  Wages were with them a minor consideration; one and all expressing their
  readiness to share their good old master&rsquo;s reverses of fortune.</p>

  <p>With the grooms and falconers awaiting the colonel&rsquo;s coming forth,
  were gathered several others of the household: to wit, Giles Moppett, with a
  fat turnspit at his heels; Elias Crundy, the yeoman of the cellar, who had
  brought out a large black jack filled with stout ale for the falconers;
  Holney Ticeharst, the upper gardener, and Nut Springett, his man, with two or
  three hinds from the farm-yard.</p>

  <p>The unusual circumstances of the colonel&rsquo;s riding forth to enjoy the
  pastime of hawking would have sufficed to bring a portion of the household to
  the gate; but there was another motive for gathering together so many of them
  on the present occasion, which might easily be detected in the serious
  expression of their countenances. The state-messenger&rsquo;s warning had
  struck terror into them all. Not that their fidelity to the colonel and his
  son was shaken by it; but knowing that Clavering had returned on the previous
  night, they were very apprehensive for his safety; for though told that the
  fugitive had left again before daybreak, few of them credited the statement,
  but felt convinced that he was hidden in the house.</p>

  <p>It was on this alarming topic that they were now conversing together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well-a-day! these be sad times indeed!&rdquo; old Ticehurst
  observed. &ldquo;Wheresoever our young master may be, there I hope his
  enemies will never find him. Hast any news to gi&rsquo; us, Master Moppett?
  Thou be&rsquo;st a scholard like his reverence, Master Beard, and
  read&rsquo;st de pappers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no news likely to yield thee much satisfaction, good Master
  Ticehurst,&rdquo; Moppett replied. &ldquo;I have read both the Perfect
  Diurnal and the Mercurius Politicus, and they are full of nothing save the
  Lord General Cromwell&rsquo;s late glorious victory over the Scots king (as
  they term his most sacred Majesty) at Worcester; telling us how old Noll
  returned to London, and was met by a procession of the Men of Westminster,
  and how he made a triumphal entry into the City; how great rejoicings were
  held, and how the poor Scots prisoners were marched through the streets.
  Stay! I have one piece of news&mdash;and sorry bad news it is !&mdash;the
  brave Earl of Derby, the Earl of Lauderdale, and some other Royalists, who
  fought at Worcester, have been captured in Cheshire, and it is said will all
  be brought to the block, Heaven avert the like fate from our young
  master!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, Heaven avert it from him, and from one higher than him,&rdquo;
  said Eustace Saxby, in a deep, earnest tone. &ldquo;Canst give us any tidings
  of the King, Master Moppett? Hath he escaped the bloodhounds set on his
  track? &lsquo;Tis to be hoped he will be watched over as David was when
  pursued by Saul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There be all sorts of rumours concerning him,&rdquo; Moppett
  rejoined; &ldquo;and right glad am I that there be so, for their number will
  serve to mislead his enemies. Most likely his Majesty be hidden in some
  ellinge old house in Hampshire, waiting for a vessel to convey him to France.
  Such is the colonel&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the colonel ought to know, methinks, if any man doth,&rdquo;
  Elias Crundy observed. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t his Majesty come to the
  Grange? Our master could soon hire him a fishing-smack at New-haven or
  Shoreham to carry him across the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more easily said than done, Elias,&rdquo; Eustace
  Saxby rejoined. &ldquo;No one is allowed to embark at any port along the
  coast without special licence. And as to the Grange being a safe
  hiding-place, I&rsquo;m very doubtful about it. Only yesterday, I heard from
  a Brightelmstone Jug, whom I met at Rottingdean Gap, that a troop of old
  Noll&rsquo;s terrible Ironsides, under Captain Stelfax, have arrived at
  Lewes; and that all houses in the neighbourhood, suspected of harbouring
  fugitive Royalists, are to be strictly searched by &lsquo;em&mdash;the Grange
  one of the first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord presarve us from these ravenous wolves and regicides!&rdquo;
  Crundy exclaimed. &ldquo;That be bad news, indeed! But I hope it ben&rsquo;t
  true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeardt yo&rsquo;n find it o&rsquo;er true, Elias,&rdquo;
  Nut Springett remarked, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard John Habergeon speak of Captain Stelfax,&rdquo;
  Giles Moppett said; &ldquo;and a bloody and barbarous rebel he must be, from
  John&rsquo;s account. He goes to work at once with thumbscrew and
  boot&mdash;thumbscrew and boo&mdash;d&rsquo;ye mind that, my masters? If he
  comes here we shall all be put to the torture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if we be, the truculent Roundhead shall discover
  nothing,&rdquo; Eustace Saxby cried, resolutely. &ldquo;Let him do his worst.
  He will learn what stuff a loyal Sussex yeoman is made of. If thy black jack
  ben&rsquo;t empty, prithee fill up the horn, Elias. I would fain drink a
  health, which Master Moppett tells me was drunk in the dining-hall last
  night&mdash;soon after young master&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drink it under thy breath then, Eustace,&rdquo; Moppett observed;
  &ldquo;there be spies about, and no saying who may overhear thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll drink confusion to the king&rsquo;s
  enemies! and may his Majesty soon enjoy his Own again!&rdquo; the falconer
  exclaimed aloud, emptying the foaming horn offered him by Crundy.</p>

  <p>Ninian Saxby took no part in the foregoing discourse. After quaffing a
  horn of humming ale with the rest, he began to wind a call upon his bugle
  that made the walls of the old house echo to the cheerful notes. Perhaps this
  might have been intended as a signal, for as he sauntered towards the porch,
  who should issue from it but Patty Whinchat!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give you good day, sweetheart,&rdquo; quoth Ninian, gallantly
  doffing his cap. &ldquo;How blithe and bonny you do look this morning, fegs!
  Now for a well-turned phrase to tickle her ears withal,&rdquo; he added to
  himself. &ldquo;You look for all the world like a newly-roused
  tercel-gentle&mdash;the tercel is the falcon&rsquo;s mate, Patty, and the
  falcon is a hawk for a prince&mdash;when after mantling, as we falconers term
  it, she crosseth her wings over her back, and disposeth herself to
  warble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To warble!&rdquo; the handmaiden exclaimed. &ldquo;Lawk a mercy! I
  never yet heard that a hawk doth sing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither doth she, Patty; but she warbleth, nevertheless&mdash;that
  is to say, she sitteth erect as yon tartaret doth on my father&rsquo;s fist.
  Dost know what &lsquo;coming to the lure&rsquo;means, Patty? If not, I will
  teach thee&mdash;I will, fegs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I know well enough,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;and I would
  have you know, in return, that I am not to be lured, like a silly bird, by
  the call of a cunning falconer, or by the tinkling of silver bells. If you
  must whistle for some one, let it be at Morefruit Stone&rsquo;s door, and I
  warrant you his daughter Temperance, Puritan though she be, will come forth
  quickly. The luring-bells may be tried with Dorcas Thatcher, the
  milkmaid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are like a raking musket, Patty, that forsakes her proper game,
  and flyeth at daw, or pie, or any other bird that chances to cross her. I,
  Ninian, am thy quarry&mdash;I am, fegs! Thou shalt bind me, and plume me, and
  truss me, if thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A truce to this nonsense, sirrah,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Be
  serious for a moment, if you can, and attend to me. There is something
  strange going on in the house. I can&rsquo;t make it out, for Mistress Dulcia
  won&rsquo;t admit me into her confidence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A word in your ear, Patty,&rdquo; the young falconer said, drawing
  closer to her. &ldquo;Is anybody hidden in the house?&mdash;you under-stand,
  eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Patty did not trust herself to answer otherwise than by an affirmative
  nod.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young master?&rdquo; Ninian whispered.</p>

  <p>Another nod.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your&rsquo;re quite sure of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two more nods.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; Ninian muttered. &ldquo;Then it behoves
  us all to be upon the watch&mdash;it does, fegs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It behoves you to keep a close tongue in your head, sir, and not to
  blab a secret of such importance to any of the numerous maidens to whom you
  pay court. However, I do want you to keep watch over some one in
  particular.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Name him, and it shall be done&mdash;it shall, fegs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is Increase Micklegift. May I trust you, Ninian? Well, then, my
  young lady met him this morning in the churchyard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Met Increase Micklegift! whew! What sort of &lsquo;lure&rsquo; did
  he use, Patty?&mdash;the whistle, or the bells, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She was seared by him, rather than lured, poor gentle dove!&rdquo;
  the handmaiden rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say the word, Patty, and a bolt from my cross-bow shall visit the
  canting preacher&rsquo;s skull&mdash;smash it like an addled egg. It shall,
  fegs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Killing him won&rsquo;t help Mistress Dulcia. I&rsquo;ll tell you
  what to do. But hush! they are coming forth. More another time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, she hastily retreated, while Ninian drew back with equal
  celerity.</p>

  <p>A moment or two afterwards, the stately figure of Colonel Maunsel appeared
  at the doorway. The old Cavalier had offered his hand to Dulcia to lead her
  forth, and was ceremoniously preceded by Martin Geere, and followed by two
  other serving-men.</p>

  <p>But before accompanying them to their horses, and noting the effect
  produced by the colonel&rsquo;s appearance on his attached retainers, let us
  see what had taken place within the house since we last left it.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3-2"
     name="ch3-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  The Proclamation</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER giving directions to Martin Geere, as before related,
  Colonel Maunsel, attended by Mr. Beard, sought his son, in order to acquaint
  him with his meditated ride to Lewes. Clavering&rsquo;s disappointment will
  be readily conceived, on hearing that, in consequence of this arrangement, he
  should be deprived of Dulcia&rsquo;s society, on which he had fondly
  calculated. However, he did not venture to remonstrate, but accepted, with
  the best grace he could, Mr. Beard&rsquo;s offer to remain with him during
  the colonel&rsquo;s compulsory absence.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, John Habergeon returned to his post, which he had
  temporarily quitted, as the reader is aware; and the colonel briefly
  explained his plans to him. The old trooper made no objection, but informed
  his master that he had ascertained, beyond a doubt, that Increase Micklegift
  had discovered that Captain Clavering was concealed in the house. John did
  not deem it needful to state how he had obtained this information, neither
  did he declare what he meant to do; but he appeared so sanguine as to his
  ability to baffle the enemy&rsquo;s machinations, that he allayed the fears
  which his intelligence was calculated to excite.</p>

  <p>As the principal bedroom in the house, the colonel&rsquo;s chamber was of
  considerable size&mdash;it was, in fact, a double room, for there was an
  inner apartment, which did not communicate with the gallery, and the entrance
  to which could be screened by a thick arras curtain. Wainscoted with lustrous
  old black oak, and hung with faded tapestry, the larger room had an extremely
  sombre air. In it were one or two closets, and it was furnished with a large
  oak armoire, half a dozen high-backed chairs, and a great elbow-chair, always
  used by the colonel himself, and placed near a massive oak table, on which
  were writing materials and a few books. In the inner chamber stood the
  bedstead, a very antique piece of furniture, with lofty tester, carved posts,
  and heavy hangings.</p>

  <p>His conference with John Habergeon finished, the colonel repaired to the
  inner room. Opposite the bed stood a large oak coffer, banded with iron.
  Unlocking this chest, after rummaging for a short space amongst its contents,
  he found the deed he was looking for, secured it about his person, and then
  summoning John to his aid, proceeded to equip himself for the ride; putting
  on a dark riding-dress, with boots having immense funnel tops, and large
  spurs.</p>

  <p>Mr. Beard, meantime, had gone downstairs to look after his daughter, and
  returned with her, just as the colonel&rsquo;s preparations were
  completed.</p>

  <p>A green velvet robe, with long skirts, ornamented with gold lace in front,
  and a feathered hat, constituted Dulcia&rsquo;s riding apparel; and very well
  it became her. The young damsel had been the colonel&rsquo;s constant
  companion so long as he was able to take horse exercise, and he had bestowed
  this somewhat showy dress upon her in order to evince his contempt of the
  primness and simplicity affected by the Puritans.</p>

  <p>Very little time was allowed the young folk for conversation; but even in
  that brief interval, Clavering could perceive from Dulcia&rsquo;s manner that
  her mind was troubled. To a candid nature like hers it was very painful to
  have a secret from her father; and equally distressing was it to her to think
  that Clavering should be menaced by a danger of the existence of which she
  could not warn him.</p>

  <p>Aware of the cause of her anxiety, John Habergeon sought an early
  opportunity of relieving it, and while the colonel was talking apart with Mr.
  Beard, the old trooper approached her, and whispered, &ldquo;Be not uneasy,
  my dear young lady. I overheard what passed in the churchyard. No harm shall
  befall his reverence or Captain Clavering. Trust to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These words produced an instantaneous change in Dulcia&rsquo;s spirits,
  and the few minutes more allowed to the young people ere the colonel went
  downstairs, were far more agreeably spent than those which had preceded
  them.</p>

  <p>Every head was uncovered as the colonel and his fair companion issued
  forth, and old Rupert, recognizing his master&rsquo;s voice and footstep,
  pricked his ears, and neighed a welcome. Raising his black Spanish hat,
  looped at the side, and ornamented with a sable ostrich plume, in return for
  the salutations of his dependents, the old Cavalier paused for a moment to
  look round, still retaining Dulcia&rsquo;s hand within his own. Though he
  appeared thin and careworn, all his retainers were struck by his unwonted
  activity, for he did not seem to need the support of his crutch-handled
  stick, or even of Dulcia&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>After exchanging a few words with Eustace Saxby, who advanced to receive
  his instructions, the colonel assisted Dulcia to her saddle, and then
  prepared to mount Rupert. On being brought up to his master, the old charger
  manifested his delight by whinnying softly, and thrust his nose into the
  colonel&rsquo;s hands, as the latter patted him kindly. The moment was now
  come when the old Cavalier&rsquo;s new-born activity was to be more sharply
  tested than it had hitherto been. When he placed his foot in the stirrup and
  attempted to mount, the effort wrung a groan from him, and it required the
  strong arm of the groom to lift him upon Rupert&rsquo;s back.</p>

  <p>Hawking not being the real business that the colonel had in hand, he
  dispensed with the attendance of Barnaby Lashmere and the supplementary
  hawks, contenting himself with the birds which the ostreger had upon his
  fist.</p>

  <p>The party then set forth in gallant style, but had scarcely issued from
  the gate, when they came to a sudden halt.</p>

  <p>On gaining the road, it was noticed for the first time by all, that a
  board had been hung against the trunk of a large tree which grew by the gate.
  On this board, evidently designed for the purpose, was pasted a Proclamation,
  from the Council of State, for the Discovery and Apprehension of Charles
  Stuart, his Adherents and Abettors. A Reward of 1000l. was offered to
  whomsoever should apprehend the said Charles Stuart: while penalties of High
  Treason were menaced against all who should harbour him, or aid him to
  escape. Proportionate rewards were offered for the apprehension of Charles
  Stuart&rsquo;s adherents, with penalties of fine and imprisonment for
  concealing them, or lending them assistance. Strict commands were given, in
  conclusion, to all officers of Port Towns, and others in authority, to permit
  no person to pass beyond Sea without special licence.</p>

  <p>After perusing the proclamation, the colonel demanded, in a furious voice,
  who had dared to put it up?</p>

  <p>An answer came from an unexpected quarter. Some half-dozen individuals,
  who had been standing behind another large tree at a short distance from the
  first, now came forward, and one of them detaching himself from the rest,
  marched towards the colonel. It was the state-messenger, with whom the old
  Cavalier had parleyed that morning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou askest by whom that proclamation touching the apprehension of
  the Man Charles Stuart hath been set up,&rdquo; the messenger said.
  &ldquo;Know, Wolston Maunsel, that it was I, Nehemiah Lift-up-hand, who
  placed it on the tree growing at thy gate. I did so at the bidding of Hezron
  Stelfax, Captain of the Lord-General Cromwell&rsquo;s own chosen troop of
  Ironsides; the said valiant and God-fearing captain being now at
  Lewes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pluck it down, some of ye, and hew it in pieces,&rdquo; the colonel
  ejaculated, wrathfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let any man remove it on peril of his life,&rdquo; Nehemiah cried,
  taking a pistol from his belt. &ldquo;I have placed the mandate before thy
  dwelling, thou son of Belial, and there it shall remain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As the words were uttered, the persons by whom the messenger was attended
  came up, and proved to be the emissary from Goldsmiths&rsquo; Hall, Thomas
  Sunne, Thomas Geere, and Increase Micklegift. The Independent minister,
  however, kept a little in the rear of the others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do as I bid ye! On your fealty to me&mdash;on your allegiance to
  the king&mdash;I charge you pluck down that proclamation,&rdquo; the colonel
  vociferated.</p>

  <p>But no one stirred.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy servants owe no allegiance to the son of the man who caused
  Israel to sin,&rdquo; Nehemiah rejoined, &ldquo;and who provoked the Lord God
  of Israel to anger by his vanities. Even as Elah, the son of Baasha, was
  slain by Zimri, captain of the chariots, so shall Charles, the son of
  Charles, perish by the hand of the great captain of our new
  Israel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take heed lest an Omri arise to depose thy murderous and rebellious
  leader,&rdquo; the colonel retorted, carried away by passion, &ldquo;and
  cause him to burn the king&rsquo;s house over him, so that he perish by fire,
  like Zimri. Since none of you will pluck down that insolent placard, I will
  do so myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ere he could execute his rash purpose, however, the twang of a bow was
  heard, a quarrel whistled past, and plunged deeply into the bark of the tree,
  severing the cord by which the board was hung to a small branch. Whereupon,
  the proclamation instantly dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>A loud burst of laughter from his companions followed this proof of
  Ninian&rsquo;s skill in the management of the cross-bow. But the young
  falconer took instantly to his heels; probably thereby escaping the vengeance
  of Nehemiah, who, on discovering the author of the mischief, discharged his
  pistol at him, but without effect.</p>

  <p>The report of the pistol, echoing loudly through the valley, brought
  several other persons to the scene of action. Menacing cries arose at the
  same time from the colonel&rsquo;s attendants, amongst whom were Eustace
  Saxby, Martin Geere, Giles Moppett, old Ticehurst, Elias Crundy, and the rest
  of our acquaintances, who had accompanied their master to the gate. But the
  most formidable demonstration was made by Ninian, who, having fled to the
  farmyard, presently returned at the head of a posse of rustics, armed with
  flails, pitchforks, and bills. These sturdy fellows, as they rushed up,
  surrounded Colonel Maunsel and Dulcia, like a bodyguard, uttering fearful
  threats against the Roundheads.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nehemiah and his party had been materially reinforced,
  and maintained their ground resolutely. No sooner was the pistol fired by the
  state- messenger, than, apprehensive of mischief, Thomas Geere hurried off to
  all such cottages as were tenanted by Puritans, and in a very short space of
  time collected together some dozen or fourteen hinds, armed much in the same
  manner as Ninian&rsquo;s companions. Chief amongst these upholders of the
  authority of the Rump Parliament was Morefruit Stone, a fanatic of such a
  morose-looking and ill- favoured aspect, that if his daughter Temperance had
  borne any resemblance to him, it is not likely she would ever have caused
  Patty Whinchat a moment&rsquo;s jealous uneasiness.</p>

  <p>A conflict seemed imminent; and if it took place, the passions of the men
  on both sides being fully roused, there could be no doubt that the
  consequences would be disastrous. It was this feeling that prevented the
  colonel from allowing his men to make an attack upon their opponents.</p>

  <p>Taking up a position by the side of his father, Ninian began deliberately
  to bend his cross-bow with the gaffle, muttering to himself, as he did
  so,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twere a pity to lose a chance like this. If I happen to hit
  yon psalm- singing rook, &lsquo;twill be a good riddance, and little harm
  done, fegs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Unconscious of his danger, the Independent divine seemed anxiously bent
  upon preventing a collision between the opposing parties. Addressing himself
  to the Puritanical cottagers, over whom, as their minister, he naturally
  exercised great control, and specially to Morefruit Stone, as an elder, he
  enjoined them not to strike a blow unless they themselves were stricken; and
  his pacific efforts were seconded by Thomas Sunne, who seemed to labour under
  great alarm. Having succeeded in keeping the members of his flock quiet,
  Micklegift next addressed himself to Nehemiah, who boldly confronted the
  colonel and his clamorous attendants. The state-messenger had not budged an
  inch, but having drawn a second pistol from his belt, held it in
  readiness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put up thy weapon, Nehemiah,&rdquo; Micklegift said to him,
  &ldquo;and cut not off any of these malignants in their sin. Leave them time
  for repentance and amendment. Perchance, they may yet be gathered into the
  fold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How sayst thou?&rdquo; Nehemiah exclaimed. &ldquo;Wouldst have me
  allow the proclamation of the Parliament, whose officer I am, to be cast down
  and trampled under foot? Wouldst have me tamely stand by, and hear his
  Excellency the Lord-General Cromwell insulted by yon contumacious malignant?
  As spake Joshua the son of Nun&mdash;&lsquo;O Lord, what shall I say, when
  Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?&rsquo;&mdash;what shall I
  say unto the captain of our second Joshua when his mandates have been set at
  nought. Interpose not between me and these men of Ai.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say unto thee again, put up thy weapon, Nehemiah,&rdquo; the
  Independent minister rejoined; &ldquo;for if thou take the life of this man,
  or the life of any of his followers, thou shalt not be justified. Make not of
  this peaceful dene a second Valley of Achor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then seeing Colonel Maunsel draw his sword, as if about to lead his men to
  the attack, he stepped fearlessly towards him, and taking hold of his bridle,
  besought him to desist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou who wouldst stay me?&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel cried,
  feigning not to recognize him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy friend, if thou wilt let me be so,&rdquo; Micklegift rejoined,
  in a pacific tone, &ldquo;who would fain save thee from the peril into which
  thou art about to rush. Have respect, I pray thee, for lawful and constituted
  authority. Join thy entreaties to mine, damsel,&rdquo; he added to Dulcia,
  seeing that the colonel paid little heed to him, &ldquo;and prevail upon this
  hot-headed gentleman not to bring certain destruction upon himself and
  others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a certain significance in Micklegift&rsquo;s tone that, even in
  that moment, did not escape Dulcia, and she at once comprehended the jeopardy
  in which the infuriated old Cavalier&rsquo;s rashness might place Clavering
  and her father. She therefore implored the colonel not to engage in actual
  strife with the Parliamentary officer and his supporters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall not come to blows with them till you are out of
  harm&rsquo;s way, rest assured, girl,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Disperse your followers, Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo; Micklegift
  continued, in a low tone, &ldquo;and I will answer for it that the matter
  shall be amicably adjusted. Believe me, I counsel for the best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed he does,&rdquo; Dulcia cried. &ldquo;In this instance, at
  all events,&rdquo; she added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! dost thou, too, side with Puritans and rebels, girl?&rdquo;
  the colonel cried. &ldquo;Well, I own I have been over hasty,&rdquo; he
  continued, returning his sword to the scabbard; &ldquo;yet the knave gave me
  great provocation.&rdquo; Then turning to his followers, he said, &ldquo;I
  thank you, good fellows, for this display of your attachment, but I will not
  put it to further proof. Return to your occupations, all of you&mdash;except
  Eustace Saxby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this, the throng around him moved off, though reluctantly, and with
  very dissatisfied looks; many of them turning round as they went to shake
  their fists at the Roundheads, or make other gestures of defiance. Observing
  Ninian linger behind, the colonel motioned him to depart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must I go too, your honour?&rdquo; the young falconer asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of a certainty,&rdquo; the old Cavalier answered. &ldquo;Yon
  pestilent varlet will be sure to take exception to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s wishing your honour and Mistress Dulcia a pleasant
  morning&rsquo;s pastime, then,&rdquo; Ninian said, doffing his cap,
  &ldquo;though it hath begun badly, fegs! Take the spaniels, father.
  I&rsquo;ll go round by the shaw,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and join you by
  the nearest burgh on the downs. The rook hath &lsquo;scaped me now,&rdquo; he
  muttered, eyeing Micklegift askance, as he went away; &ldquo;but though I
  have missed this chance, I may find another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the exhortation of Micklegift, Morefruit Stone and the rest
  of the sanctimonious flock had likewise returned to their labour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace is restored,&rdquo; Micklegift said to the colonel.
  &ldquo;Proceed on thy way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; Nehemiah exclaimed. &ldquo;I will not shut mine ears
  to the voice of a Minister of the Word, and since thou desirest peace, peace
  there shall be. Yet ere I suffer this dangerous malignant to pass, I must
  know his errand. He is placed under restraint by the Council, and may not go
  beyond a limit of five miles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hear what the man in authority saith,&rdquo; Micklegift cried,
  addressing the colonel. &ldquo;Satisfy him, I pray you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My errand is apparent,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined, chafing at
  the interruption. &ldquo;I am not as yet a prisoner in my own house, and am
  about to enjoy the pastime of hawking upon yonder downs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So thou sayest,&rdquo; Nehemiah rejoined; &ldquo;but I have been
  too often deluded by those of thy dissembling party to trust thee without
  some pledge of thy sincerity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! dost dare to doubt me, fellow?&rdquo; the colonel cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hinder him not,&rdquo; Micklegift interposed. &ldquo;I will be his
  surety.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou!&rdquo; Nehemiah exclaimed, in astonishment, while the colonel
  himself looked equally surprised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even I, one of the elect,&rdquo; the minister replied. &ldquo;Let
  him pass freely. These worthy persons,&rdquo; he added, in a lower tone to
  the colonel, glancing at the same time at Dulcia, &ldquo;tarry with me till
  to-morrow, and much vexation and trouble may be spared thee by discreet
  behaviour towards them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To this speech the colonel vouchsafed no reply, but rode slowly past
  Nehemiah and the emissary from Goldsmiths&rsquo; Hall, who stood beside him,
  followed by the elder Saxby with the hawks and spaniels.</p>

  <p>As Dulcia went by, the Independent minister drew near her, and regarding
  her fixedly, said in a low tone, &ldquo;I shall expect thy answer to-morrow,
  damsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-3"
     name="ch3-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  The Tartaret And The Heron</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER this somewhat inauspicious commencement of his ride,
  Colonel Maunsel, with Dulcia and Eustace Saxby, turned off on the right, and
  mounting a steep road cut in the chalk, which skirted the garden-wall, soon
  gained the charming down at the rear of the mansion.</p>

  <p>The day was delightful. A pleasant breeze, fresh but not too strong, and
  redolent of the sea, came from the south-west. Fleecy clouds swept rapidly
  overhead, their shadows flitting across the downs in the direction which the
  party were about to take. So invigorating was the breeze&mdash;so beautiful
  the prospect&mdash;so calm and gentle the aspect of all nature&mdash;that the
  colonel, though worn-out by long watching, fatigue of body, and great mental
  anxiety&mdash;exasperated, moreover, by the insults he had recently
  endured&mdash;soon experienced the kindly influence of the scene, felt his
  chest dilate, and his spirits revive.</p>

  <p>At no point, as we have elsewhere remarked, are the downs more beautiful
  than here. Our old Cavalier had a great love for the eminence on which he now
  found himself. In moments of impatience he talked of exiling himself from the
  rebellious land of his birth, but he would have been miserable if he had
  carried his threat into execution. His severe rheumatic attacks having
  confined him of late altogether to the house and garden, summer had gone by,
  and he had not once visited his favourite downs. It was therefore, with
  redoubled delight that he found himself, after so long an absence, once more
  upon their breezy heights. He seemed as if he would never tire with gazing at
  the prospect around him. Familiar as it was, if he had looked upon it for the
  first time it could not have charmed him more.</p>

  <p>Crossing the brow of the hill, the party reached the brim of a steep
  escarpment dipping into a beautifully hollowed combe; and here the colonel
  came to a momentary halt. The sides of this hollow, smooth as if scooped out
  by art, were covered with a carpet of the richest turf. Here and there, a
  little rounded prominence, or gentle depression, heightened their charm, as a
  mole or a dimple may lend piquancy to the cheek of beauty. A delightful air
  of solitude reigned over this fairy dell, which well deserves its present
  designation of the Happy Valley. On the right of the combe, near a circular
  excavation filled with water for sheep, grew a grove of trees of considerable
  size, with a thicket beyond them. The sides of the down, which hemmed in the
  valley on the opposite side, were by no means so steep as those of the
  escarpment, and had a warm brown tint, being clothed with gorse and heather.
  Through the midst of the combe wound a road leading from Rottingdean to
  Lewes, and looking over the shoulder of the hill on the right, could be
  discerned the old church and clustered houses of the former place.</p>

  <p>While contemplating this beautiful combe, the colonel fell into a reverie,
  which Dulcia did not care to disturb, and Eustace Saxby remained at a little
  distance behind them. The silence, therefore, was unbroken, until a blithe
  voice was heard singing:</p>

  <p>&lsquo;In my conceit, no pleasure like to hawking there can be:</p>

  <p>The tongue it lures, the legs they leap, the eye beholds the glee;</p>

  <p>No idle thought can harbour well within the falconer&rsquo;s brain,</p>

  <p>or though his sports right pleasant be, yet are they mixed with pain.</p>

  <p>He lures, he leaps, he calls, he cries, he joys, he waxeth sad,</p>

  <p>And frames his mood, according as his hawk doth ill or bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! art there, Ninian?&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, as,
  recognizing the voice of the singer, he looked back and perceived the young
  falconer descending the slope towards them. &ldquo;I ought to chide thee for
  disobeying orders. But i&rsquo; faith! I am not sorry thou hast come after
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ninian, who had disencumbered himself of his cross-bow, and brought a
  hawking- pole with him instead, laughed cheerily, and went on with his
  song:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At cockpit some their pleasures place to wager health away,</p>

  <p>Where falconers only force the fields to hear the spaniels bay.</p>

  <p>What greater glee can man desire, than by his cunning skill,</p>

  <p>So to reclaim a haggard hawk, as she the fowl shall kill;</p>

  <p>To make and man her in such sort, as tossing out a train,</p>

  <p>Or but the lure, when she&rsquo;s at large, to whoop her back
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well sung, i&rsquo; faith, lad!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel, as
  Ninian drew near him. &ldquo;There is good sense in thy ballad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is written by old Geordie Turbervile,&rdquo; Ninian replied.
  &ldquo;There is more of it, if your honour and Mistress Dulcia have patience
  to listen.&rdquo; And he struck up again:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When hawks are hurt and bruis&rsquo;d by rash encounter in the
  skies,</p>

  <p>What better skill than for their harms a powder to devise,</p>

  <p>To dry the blood within the bulk, and make the mummy so</p>

  <p>As no physician greater art on patients can bestow?</p>

  <p>To cut her hoods, to shape her jess, her tyrets, and her line,</p>

  <p>With bells and bewets, varvels eke, to make the falcon fine,</p>

  <p>Believe me is no common skill, nor every day devise,</p>

  <p>But meet for civil, courtly men that are reputed wise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A good song, and well trolled,&rdquo; cried the colonel. &ldquo;But
  let us set forward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Taking their way over several gentle undulations, covered with the softest
  sward, and still keeping on the uplands, the party, ere long, approached a
  large barn, in front of which was a stubble-field, and here, as a covey of
  partridges was pretty sure, to be found the spaniels were uncoupled, and set
  free by Niniang while the colonel took the merlin from the elder Saxby, and
  began to unstrike her hood.</p>

  <p>After ranging for a while within the new-shorn field, bounding from ridge
  to ridge, and leaving scarce an inch of ground untried, the dogs became
  suddenly motionless, and Eustace Saxby, who, with his son, had followed them
  cautiously, now gave a sign to his master, by raising his hand, that the
  partridges were found.</p>

  <p>The colonel then advanced, and when within a short distance of the
  falconers, unhooded the merlin, and cast her from his fist, crying out,
  &ldquo;Hey, gar! gar!&rdquo; No sooner was the merlin upon the wing, than,
  urged by Eustace, the spaniels rushed in and sprung the partridges. After
  them darted the hawk, while the terrified birds, instantly perceiving their
  danger, strove to escape by rapid flight&mdash;vainly strove, as it turned
  out, for with marvellous quickness two of their number were stricken to the
  ground by the merlin, and almost as quickly retrieved by the spaniels, who,
  guided and incited by the cries of the falconers, followed the flight of the
  hawk.</p>

  <p>At this moment, and while the partridges, scattered in their terror, were
  still upon the wing, the Barbary falcon, which had been committed to Dulcia,
  was unhooded by her and cast off, and with inconceivable swiftness joined her
  companion in the chase. All was now animation and excitement, the falconers
  shouting and encouraging dogs and hawks, and loudly applauding every
  successful stroke of the latter, the colonel riding after them shouting
  likewise, and closely attended by Dulcia.</p>

  <p>Being very fleet of wing and keen of beak, the tartaret did terrible
  execution. Such of the scared and bewildered partridges as escaped from the
  merlin fell beneath his gripping talons, and almost in as brief space as we
  have taken to recount the occurrence, was the whole covey struck to the
  ground, and retrieved by the spaniels. The hawks were then lured back by the
  falconers, and bountifully rewarded for their pains by gorges of the
  prey&mdash;the elder Saxby making for them what is called the Italian soppa.
  The partridges having been counted, and tied together by Ninian, were given
  by him to a shepherd lad, who had joined them, to convey to the Grange.</p>

  <p>So excited had Colonel Maunsel been by the pastime, that for the moment he
  quite forgot his troubles, and it was with improved spirits that he once more
  set forward on his way; shaping his course in a north-easterly direction over
  the downs, chatting pleasantly with Dulcia as he went, and now and then
  addressing a word to the falconers, who kept close beside him. He resisted,
  however, all their attempts to induce him to flee the hawks again; declining
  to enter a holt, wherein Ninian told him there was a nye of pheasants; and
  paying no attention to Eustace, when the latter pointed out a reedy pond in a
  hollow, where he would be sure to find wild-fowl&mdash;a spring of teals, or
  a covert of coots. Neither would he permit a cast of the merlin at what the
  young falconer styled a &ldquo;congregation&rdquo; of starlings.</p>

  <p>Proceeding in this way at an easy pace&mdash;now descending into a broad
  valley&mdash;now mounting another heather-clad down&mdash;anon passing over
  an elevated platform covered with fine green turf, on which he encountered a
  large square encampment, the colonel reached the summit of Kingston Hill,
  where a magnificent view burst upon him. Almost at his feet, as it
  seemed&mdash;though, in reality, three or four miles off&mdash;lay the
  ancient and picturesque town of Lewes.</p>

  <p>A very striking object is Lewes, as viewed from this lofty eminence; but,
  striking as it is, it constitutes only a small portion of the vast and
  extraordinary picture presented to the looker-on&mdash;a picture so vast,
  indeed, that it cannot be taken in at a glance, but must be regarded from the
  right, and from the left. Surrounded by an amphitheatre of lofty hills, and
  planted upon a protruded town, rising amid the Levels, the old town occupies
  a singularly commanding position. In the midst of it, reared upon a high
  mound, so as to dominate the surrounding structures, stands its proud Norman
  castle, with its grey gateway, ivied towers, and keep. Many churches and
  venerable edifices are there in the quaint old town&mdash;many large gardens
  and fine trees&mdash; and most noticeable of all, the picturesque ruins of
  its reverend priory.</p>

  <p>Beneath Kingston Hill lie the broad Lewes Levels, a large alluvial plain,
  through which the narrow and meandering Ouse flows towards the sea, to find
  an embouchure at Newhaven. At the southern extremity of the valley is
  Newhaven itself, with the bold promontory called the Castle Hill overlooking
  its harbour. Opposite, on the eastern side of the wide plain, is the majestic
  Mount Caburn, the southern point of the Cliffe range of hills, Firle Beacon,
  and Malling Hill, with its sheer white cliff, at the back of Lewes. Towards
  the north-east the eye ranges over a vast woody tract, comprising a great
  portion of the Weald of Sussex, but known in the days of Roman subjugation as
  the Anderida Sylva, in the days of the Saxons as the Andredswald, and during
  the Heptarchy as the Royal Chase. Inward, the view extends as far as
  Crow-borough and the Reigate Hills&mdash;a range of nigh forty miles. To the
  west of Lewes, and commanding the Weald, is the monarch of the South Downs,
  Mount Harry, so designated after the famous battle fought upon its sides
  wherein Harry the Third was worsted by Simon de Montfort and the Barons.</p>

  <p>While the colonel gazed delightedly upon this immense panorama, Ninian,
  whose quick eye was sweeping the horizon in search of some bird upon which to
  exercise the prowess of the Barbary falcon, perceived a heron, probably from
  the heronry in Angmering Park, sailing slowly towards them, in the direction
  of the marshy flats near Newhaven, and he instantly called his master&rsquo;s
  attention to the stately bird. The old Cavalier hesitated for a moment,
  thinking the tartaret too small to make a flight at a heron, but being
  assured on this score by Eustace, he assented. When the heron, who came
  slowly on, with wide wings expanded, and long neck and bill stretched out,
  had drawn sufficiently near, as the colonel judged, he took off the
  tartaret&rsquo;s hood, and dismissed her, shouting out, as before,
  &ldquo;Hey, gar! gar!&rdquo; while the falconers also encouraged her by their
  cries.</p>

  <p>Startled by these noises, and at the same moment perceiving her enemy, the
  heron instantly quickened her flight. Swift as an arrow from a bow, the brave
  little tartaret climbed towards her quarry. It was a fine sight to watch her
  mount, and strive to overtop the heron, who now, fully comprehending her
  danger, soared upwards likewise, till well-nigh lost to view.</p>

  <p>Both birds now looked like specks as their movements were watched by the
  group below. Ninian, who had the quickest and best eye of the party, and who
  had never lost sight of the birds, told them at last, with great exultation,
  that the tartaret had made her mounte and got above the heron. On hearing
  this, the colonel uttered an exclamation of delight, as did the elder Saxby.
  Hoping to avoid the hawk&rsquo;s fatal stoop, the heron now descended as
  rapidly as she had previously soared aloft&mdash;the tartaret coming after
  her with equal quickness.</p>

  <p>The crisis of the struggle was now at hand, as the watchers well knew, and
  they looked on with increased anxiety. All at once the heron turned over on
  her back, with her long, sharp beak pointed upwards, like a lance, to impale
  her foe.</p>

  <p>At this moment the tartaret made her stoop, and dropped like a stone upon
  her quarry, seizing her and binding her. Both birds then fell together, and
  reached the ground at the foot of the precipitous descent, down which Ninian
  ran with great swiftness, hoping to be in time to rescue the hawk. But ere he
  got up all was over with the brave little tartaret. The heron&rsquo;s bill
  had transfixed her when she made her stoop, and the gallant bird was dead ere
  touching the ground.</p>

  <p>The hawk and her quarry were lying together. The heron was still alive,
  but grievously wounded, and Ninian at once despatched her.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-4"
     name="ch3-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  Captain Stelfax</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;ALACK! alack! my pretty tartaret, thou art beyond the
  aid of mummy-powder,&rdquo; Ninian exclaimed, as having liberated the yet
  warm body of the falcon from the cruel bill of its adversary, he was
  smoothing the blood-stained mails on its breast. &ldquo;A lusty, roystering
  hawk thou wert, and sore grieved am I to lose thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He might have gone on bemoaning his favourite for some while longer, had
  not the trampling of horses suddenly roused him. Looking in the direction
  whence the sound proceeded, he perceived a small body of troopers advancing
  towards him at a rapid trot along the road leading from the adjacent village
  of Kingston to Iford and Rodmill. He knew that these men must belong to the
  Parliamentary army, for since the rout at Worcester not a dozen Royalist
  soldiers, horse or foot, could have been got together. The little band
  numbered twenty men, and with them was an officer. Having heard from his
  father that a detachment of Cromwell&rsquo;s Ironsides had just arrived at
  Lewes, Ninian rightly divined that these men must belong to that invincible
  troop. Their leader, in fact, was no other than the dreaded Captain
  Stelfax.</p>

  <p>Not liking to hurry off, the young falconer judged it best to remain where
  he was until the troop should pass by. They were now within bow-shot of him,
  and he could discern that they were all powerful-looking men, well-mounted,
  well- accoutred, and apparently well-deserving the hardy name they had
  acquired. Their doublets and saddle-cloths were of scarlet, the original
  bright hue of which had suffered from exposure to weather, and service in the
  field; but their steel breastplates, tassets, and head-pieces, were highly
  polished, and gleamed brightly in the sunshine. Each trooper had bandoleers
  over his shoulder, with powder-flask and bullet-bag attached to the broad
  leathern belt; and bore a long sword at his side, and a carabine slung from
  his shoulder.</p>

  <p>There was no marked distinction between the leader of the troop and those
  under his command, except that the helmet and corslet of the latter were
  filigrained, and in lieu of bandoleers he had a crimson sash fringed with
  gold across his shoulder. At his side he carried a long Toledo sword. Captain
  Stelfax was a man of middle size, heavily built, square set, and very
  muscular, and endowed with such prodigious strength of arm, that, like a
  knight of old, he could cleave a foeman to the chine. Captain Stelfax was not
  thought to be so rigorous an ascetic as the elders of his troop might have
  desired, but being a thoroughly brave soldier, and of tried fidelity to the
  cause, his failings were regarded with a lenient eye. Though ferocious in the
  field, and merciless, it was said, in his treatment of those who came within
  his grasp, his expression, on the whole, was good-humoured, and his features
  handsome, though rather coarse. His hair was cropped short, but he wore a
  bushy red beard, the glowing hue of which put to shame the tarnished
  splendour of his scarlet doublet. A weighty man, like this captain of
  Ironsides, required a strong horse to carry him, and he rode a great sorrel
  charger, who seemed quite equal to his burden.</p>

  <p>Captain Stelfax, it presently appeared, had descried the party on Kingston
  Hill, and, curious to know who they were, on coming near Ninian, halted his
  men, and shouted to the young falconer to come to him. Ninian did not dare to
  disobey, and though he would much rather have taken to his heels, he affected
  great alacrity in complying with the summons. Captain Stelfax put a few
  interrogatories to him in a brief authoritative tone, and appeared satisfied
  with the replies he received; but as soon as he ascertained that it was
  Colonel Maunsel who was on the heights, he turned to one of the troopers
  nearest him, whom he addressed as Sergeant Hadadezer Delves, and, pointing
  out the party stationed on the hill, bade him bring them down to him.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Delves executed his commission with great promptitude.
  Notwithstanding the precipitous nature of the ascent, he very soon gained the
  summit of the hill, and presenting himself before Colonel Maunsel, delivered
  his leader&rsquo;s message to him. Knowing that refusal was impossible, the
  old Cavalier expressed his readiness to accompany the sergeant&mdash;the more
  so, he said, as he was actually intending to proceed in that
  direction&mdash;and only stipulated that he and the young lady might be
  allowed to descend at a point where the declivity was less abrupt. To this
  the sergeant made no objection, and a bridle-road being indicated by Eustace
  Saxby, the whole party soon afterwards reached the valley without
  misadventure.</p>

  <p>Captain Stelfax made no advance to meet the colonel, but remained lolling
  back listlessly in his saddle, with his left hand on the hinder bow, while
  the greater part of his men having lighted their pipes, puffed away at them
  vigorously. On approaching the Roundhead troop, Colonel Maunsel haughtily
  demanded of the officer wherefore he had been sent for?</p>

  <p>Without changing his position, or making him any reply, the captain of the
  Ironsides regarded him insolently for a moment, and then casting his eye upon
  Dulcia, appeared much struck with her charms. He did not care to conceal his
  admiration, but gazed at her with much boldness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this comely damsel your daughter, Colonel Maunsel?&rdquo; he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>Offended by the question, as well as by the other&rsquo;s deportment, the
  old Cavalier felt disinclined to answer. Putting a constraint upon himself,
  however, he rejoined coldly, &ldquo;She is the daughter of the Rector of
  Ovingdean, who has been deprived of his benefice, and who resides with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ardingly Beard, is he not named?&rdquo; the other rejoined.
  &ldquo;I have him upon my list of suspected. And his daughter is called
  Dulcia. I like not the name. It is heathenish, and beseemeth not one so
  richly endowed with good gifts. Nay, avert not your face from me, damsel. A
  rough soldier&rsquo;s talk need not offend you. Perchance you have heard of
  Hezron Stelfax, captain of the Lord-General&rsquo;s chosen troop of
  Ironsides? I am he.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask me not, then, what I have heard of you, sir,&rdquo; Dulcia
  replied, sharply, &ldquo;or I may be forced to utter that which will not
  sound pleasing in your ear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can say naught that will be displeasing to me, I am well
  assured,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;But what have you heard of me? Speak out,
  and fear not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard that your whole troop are cruel and
  blood-thirsty,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;and that you are the cruelest among
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; Stelfax laughed. &ldquo;Cavaliers&rsquo; tales,
  believe me. I am cruel only to my foes&mdash;bloodthirsty only in the field.
  And so is every soldier, malignant as well as Parliamentarian. But since you
  reside with Colonel Maunsel, damsel, you must have known his son,
  Clavering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dulcia made no reply, but her check burnt hotly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo; demanded the colonel, who had with difficulty
  controlled his anger during this discourse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you not heard?&rdquo; the other said, looking at him
  steadfastly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo; the colonel cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your son fought at Worcester,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined; &ldquo;on
  that great day when the Lord of Hosts so wonderfully manifested his power,
  covering our heads in the conflict, and enabling us utterly to overthrow our
  enemies. Praise and glory to His holy name for the great success given us.
  &lsquo;Thou didst march through the land in indignation. Thou didst thrash
  the heathen in anger. Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people;
  thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not your intention, I presume, Captain Stelfax, to hold forth
  to me like a preacher at a conventicle,&rdquo; the old Cavalier observed,
  contemptuously. &ldquo;What have you to tell me concerning my son?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not desire to give you needless pain, colonel,&rdquo; Stelfax.
  &ldquo;But it is plain you have not received intelligence of your son&rsquo;s
  fate. Learn, then, that he was amongst the slain at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My son amongst the slain!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His body was found, recognized, and buried on the field of
  battle,&rdquo; Stelfax returned. &ldquo;But you need not repine. Many an
  adherent of the Man Charles Stuart suffered greater loss on that
  day&mdash;glorious to us, if disastrous to your cause. Neither need you
  grieve, fair damsel, for this poor youth,&rdquo; he added to Dulcia, &ldquo;A
  better man may be found to supply his place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were he lost, his place could never be supplied to me!&rdquo;
  Dulcia murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo; Stelfax now said to the old Cavalier,
  &ldquo;I sent for you to give you a warning. You are known to be ill-affected
  towards the Commonwealth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am known for my loyalty to my king, whom Heaven preserve!&rdquo;
  the colonel cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take heed you give not Charles Stuart shelter. Take heed you aid
  him not so that he escape beyond sea,&rdquo; Stelfax said, sternly, &ldquo;or
  you will find little mercy from your judges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I expect none,&rdquo; the colonel rejoined&mdash;&ldquo;neither
  mercy nor justice. Have you done, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the present&mdash;yes,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined.&rdquo; Yet
  hold! It is part of my duty, Colonel Maunsel, to make a strict inquisition of
  your house&mdash;Ovingdean Grange, I think &lsquo;tis called&mdash;to
  ascertain whether any fugitive malignant be concealed within it. Should you
  find me there on your return, you need not feel surprised. And now, my men,
  forward!&mdash;Farewell, sweet Dulcia! We shall soon meet again.&rdquo; So
  saying, he departed with his troop towards Iford.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel rode on in silence and great anxiety towards Kingston,
  until the Parliamentary leader and his men had disappeared from view. He then
  said to the younger Saxby, &ldquo;Thou art swift of foot, Ninian. Dost think
  that thou canst reach the Grange before yon redcoats?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, marry can I,&rdquo; the young falconer rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Off with thee, then,&rdquo; the colonel cried. &ldquo;On the
  instant of thine arrival, seek out John Habergeon&mdash;thou wilt find him in
  my chamber&mdash;and acquaint him with the intended visit of this rebel
  captain. Say to him&mdash;and say to the whole house&mdash;that my son is
  reputed to have been slain at Worcester&mdash;dost understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly, your honour,&rdquo; Ninian replied. And mounting
  Kingston Hill with the lightness and swiftness of a deer, he ran across the
  summit, and then dashed down on the further side of the eminence.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Colonel Maunsel and Dulcia, attended by Eustace Saxby, rode on
  towards Lewes.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk4"
     name="bk4">BOOK IV. THE SEARCH BY THE IRONSIDES</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch4-1"
     name="ch4-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  The Priory Ruins</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APPROACHING Lewes by the picturesque suburb of Southover,
  the little party halted near the ruins of the once magnificent priory of
  Saint Pancrace.</p>

  <p>Here, quitting the road, the colonel and Dulcia, followed by the ostreger,
  with the merlin on his fist and the spaniels at his heels, entered a smooth,
  green area, of several acres in extent, surrounded by crumbling walls and
  arches, partly overgrown by ivy and brambles, and giving some slight evidence
  of the vast dimensions of the majestic pile formerly occupying the spot.</p>

  <p>The Priory of Lewes, the first of the Cluniac order in England, was
  founded in the latter part of the eleventh century by William de Warenne and
  Gundreda his wife, daughter of the Conqueror, and was ruthlessly destroyed at
  the period of the Reformation by command of Thomas Lord Cromwell. The size
  and splendour of the conventual church&mdash;a portion only of the
  monastery&mdash;may be estimated by the report of Cromwell&rsquo;s
  commissioner, John Portmarus&mdash;a name to be held in abhorrence by the
  antiquary&mdash;who thus wrote to his employer in 1538: &ldquo;I advertised
  your lordship of the length and greatness of this church, how we had begun to
  pull the whole down to the ground, and what manner and fashion we used in
  pulling it down. I told your lordship of a vault on the right side of the
  high altar, that was borne with four pillars, having about it five chapels,
  which be compassed in with the walls, 70 steps of length, that is feet 210.
  Now we are plucking down a higher vault borne up by four thick and gross
  pillars, 14 foot from side to side, about in circumference 45
  feet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From the measurement furnished by this Vandal, we learn that the
  circumference of the conventual church was 1558 feet; the thickness of the
  steeple walls 10 feet, and the height of the steeple above the roof of the
  stately fabric, which was near 100 feet high, 90 feet. Of these ponderous
  pillars, storied windows, vaulted chapels, embowed roof, high altar, steeple,
  cloisters, and proud monuments, all are gone. Even the bones of the
  illustrious founders of the hallowed pile have been disinterred, and conveyed
  to another resting-place!</p>

  <p>Out of the disjointed fragments left&mdash;here a range of thick walls,
  with gaping apertures&mdash;there a solitary, misshapen piece of grey
  masonry&mdash;further on a yawning pit&mdash;it is scarcely possible for the
  eye of fancy to reconstruct the magnificent edifice. The knave Portmarus did
  his work effectually, and the only regret is, that he did not obtain the same
  reward for his services from Cromwell which the latter obtained from his
  master.</p>

  <p>But though nothing but a few venerable walls told of the former magnitude
  and grandeur of the ancient priory and its church, still those ruins were
  picturesque and beautiful. A clear rill flowed through the spacious court,
  washing the base of the ivy-grown fragments, and into this rill the dogs
  instantly plunged to drink and bathe. A herd of goats wandered amidst the
  broken walls, nibbling the rich pasture afforded by the turf.</p>

  <p>Within a bow-shot of the priory, on the south-west, stood a very singular
  structure, which has now totally disappeared. This was an immense
  pigeon-house, built of brick, in the form of a cross, with a tower in the
  centre. The structure was as large as many a church&mdash;much larger,
  indeed, than our diminutive church of Ovingdean&mdash;and its proportions
  will be readily conceived when we mention that it contained upwards of three
  thousand holes for pigeons, constructed of hewn chalk-stone. Around this
  gigantic dove-house clouds of pigeons circled; and when by accident the whole
  flock arose together, the air was almost darkened, while the flapping of
  wings was prodigious.</p>

  <p>Hard by the priory ruins on the east, and overlooking them, stood that
  remarkable mound, the construction of which has been attributed to one of the
  Earls of Dorset; though the hillock was probably, as has been conjectured,
  thrown up in monkish times, and designed for a Calvary. Undoubtedly, no
  better position whereon to rear cross or chapel could be found than is
  afforded by this artificial eminence. The large but shallow excavation at its
  foot&mdash;jocosely designated the Dripping-Pan&mdash;shows whence the soil
  was taken to compose the mound.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s sole purpose in seeking this retired spot being to
  leave Dulcia within it during his visit to Zachary Trangmar, he presently
  dismounted, and consigning old Rupert to the charge of the ostreger, and
  promising speedy return, he went his way.</p>

  <p>Amid a scene so beautiful, and on a day so bright and sunny, with so many
  objects of great and peculiar interest around her&mdash;the ruins of the
  antique priory, with its historical associations&mdash;the gigantic
  dove-house, with its myriad occupants, in itself a never-wearying
  spectacle&mdash;the neighbouring mound&mdash;the old and picturesque town of
  Lewes, with its quaint, climbing houses and its towering castle&mdash;the
  noble amphitheatre of downs encircling her, and now glowing radiantly in the
  sunshine&mdash;with this picture before her, Dulcia might have been glad to
  be left to its contemplation for a while, had her mind been at ease. But,
  alas! ever since the interview with the terrible captain of Ironsides new
  fears had beset her, and full of anxiety for Clavering and her father, she
  found it impossible to enjoy the various objects of attraction displayed
  before her.</p>

  <p>After gazing listlessly around, scarcely noticing the cloud of doves
  hovering overhead, or alighting on the ruins, and which specially attracted
  the attention of Eustace Saxby, making him long to try the merlin at such a
  wonderful &ldquo;flight,&rdquo; Dulcia fixed her eyes on the little rill
  flowing at her feet, and pensively awaited the colonel&rsquo;s return.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-2"
     name="ch4-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  Mock-Beggar Hall And Its Inmate</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE pleasant suburb of Southover, now constituting an
  important portion of Lewes itself, consisted, at the time of which we write,
  of a few scattered houses, some of which skirted the road leading past the
  church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, where now rest the bones of
  William de Warenne and Gundreda; while others were built on the south side of
  the gently sloping and well-wooded hill. A clear brook flowing through a
  charming valley separated the suburb from the parent town. Towards this
  valley our old Cavalier now wended his way. Traversing a road shaded by noble
  trees, and crossing a little bridge over the brook, he presently reached the
  porch of an ancient mansion.</p>

  <p>Though ancient, the house was in excellent preservation; the hard grey
  Caen stone of which it was constructed looking as fresh as if it had only
  just let the mason&rsquo;s chisel, and promising to resist the destructive
  action of the weather for centuries to come. On either side of the
  porch&mdash;to approach which a couple of steps leading into a small court
  had to be descended&mdash;was a far- projecting wing, furnished with bay
  mullioned windows. The wings had gable roofs, and on the northerly side of
  the habitation there was a massive stone chimney of very ornamental
  construction. A tolerably extensive garden was attached to the house, laid
  out in the old-fashioned style, planted with yew- trees and evergreens,
  possessing good walls for fruit, and watered by the brook that flowed through
  the valley.</p>

  <p>Hospitality on a profuse scale might have been anticipated from such a
  goodly exterior as was presented by Mock-Beggar Hall&mdash;for so was the
  house designated, perhaps in derision&mdash;but slight hospitality was
  practised within it. The door did not stand wide open so as to admit a view
  into a spacious hall, thronged with servingmen. On the contrary, it was
  closely barred. No smoke issuing from the massive stone chimney told of
  preparations for good cheer. Most of the chambers were dismantled, while the
  few that were still occupied were meagrely furnished. In the kitchen, where
  many a noble sirloin and fatted haunch had erstwhile been roasted, little
  cooking now went on. The house looked starved. In it dwelt a hard, griping
  usurer and miser.</p>

  <p>Old Zachary Trangmar had known how to profit by the troublous times in
  which he lived. When men are driven to extremity, money must be had at any
  rate of usance, or at any sacrifice, and the desperate circumstances of most
  of the adherents of the royal cause had been the old usurer&rsquo;s gain. A
  loan under such circumstances had put him in possession of Mock-Beggar
  Hall&mdash;heretofore known as the Priory House. He had sold its handsome
  furniture and fine pictures, and meant to sell the house itself, as soon as a
  favourable opportunity for doing so should offer. Meantime, he occupied it
  himself. Old Zachary&rsquo;s establishment consisted of three persons only,
  an aged domestic and his wife, who having lived with him for many years, were
  accustomed to his thrifty and penurious habits, and a stout porter, Skrow
  Antram by name, whom he thought it necessary to maintain as a protection
  against robbers.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel knocked at the door of Mock-Beggar Hall, and presently
  afterwards a little grated wicket was opened, and a surly, ill-favoured
  countenance appeared at it. After scrutinizing the colonel for a moment,
  Skrow Antram, for it was he, grunted out a word of recognition, shut-to the
  wicket, and departed, as was evident by his retreating footsteps, to consult
  his master. Ere long, he returned and unbarred the door. Thus displayed to
  view, Skrow Antram proved to be a powerfully built man, of middle age, and
  dark, sinister aspect, who, it would seem, could scarcely have been hired on
  the strength of his honest looks. He wore a leathern doublet with pewter
  buttons, with petticoat breeches of green serge tied at the knee. Making a
  clownish obeisance to the colonel, Skrow forthwith proceeded to usher him
  into his master&rsquo;s presence.</p>

  <p>Old Zachary Trangmar occupied a room on the ground floor, looking into the
  garden. It had once been a library, but books and book shelves were gone; and
  the sole piece of furniture placed against the bare walls was a large dingy
  oak press. The old usurer was seated at a table covered with deeds and
  papers. Within reach of his hand was a pair of small scales, nicely adjusted
  for weighing gold. Further on lay a pile of account-books with sheepskin
  backs. Close behind the money-lender, on the floor, was a large chest, bound
  with iron hoops.</p>

  <p>Though between seventy and eighty, old Zachary was as quick of intellect
  as ever, and keen were the glances which he cast from beneath his grey
  overhanging eyebrows at the colonel, on the entrance of the latter. Old
  Zachary wore a black velvet doublet, much frayed, and over it a loose
  murrey-coloured robe, which, like the doublet, had seen better days. A black
  silk skull-cap protected his bald head. His shrunk shanks were encased in
  nether-hose of lambswool, and his feet thrust into a pair of pantoufles. His
  features were sharp and pinched, his frame excessively thin, and his skin as
  yellow as the parchment of deeds lying beside him.</p>

  <p>Silently saluting his visitor, old Zachary motioned him to a seat. Colonel
  Maunsel bowed gravely and somewhat haughtily, and took the chair, but uttered
  not a word till Skrow Antram had retired.</p>

  <p>The usurer then looked at him with a shrewd smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The old business, I presume, colonel? More money&mdash;ha! Nothing
  else would bring you to Mock-Beggar Hall, as fools call my dwelling. You
  couldn&rsquo;t have come at a worse time. All going out&mdash;not a doit
  coming in. As I hope to be saved, I haven&rsquo;t received a noble for this
  fortnight past!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of that, thou avaricious rascal?&rdquo; cried the colonel.
  &ldquo;Thy strong-boxes are replete with rose-rials, broad pieces, and
  angels. I know it well, man&mdash;so attempt not to plead poverty with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven forfend that I should plead poverty!&rdquo; Zachary
  returned. &ldquo;I meant not that. Money enough is owing to me in all
  conscience; and if I only get my dues I shall account myself rich. But ready
  money is what I lack. You are mistaken if you suppose my chests are full,
  colonel. They have been well-nigh emptied by you and your brother Cavaliers,
  and my goodly jaco-buses and caroluses, my rose- rials and spur-rials, my
  angels and double crowns, have been turned into musty parchments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much the better for thee, thou insatiate extortioner. Here is
  another parchment to add to thy stock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon, the colonel took the deed from out his doublet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; the old usurer exclaimed, affecting to
  groan, though his eye twinkled with covetous satisfaction. &ldquo;Give it me,
  and let me look at it,&rdquo; he added, clutching at the deed like a vulture.
  &ldquo;I see! I see! this relates to your farm at Piddinghoe, which brings
  you in a hundred nobles, or about thirty- eight pounds a year? What sum do
  you want, colonel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two hundred pounds to pay my fine to the state&mdash;I must have it
  at once, thou old skinflint.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very peremptory, colonel; but suppose I cannot lend it
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I must obtain the money elsewhere, or the commissioners must
  seize upon the farm and satisfy themselves. I warrant me they will be
  content.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, that were a pity indeed&mdash;and rather than the
  unconscionable rascals should get it, I will find the two hundred pounds;
  even though I should inconvenience myself. But I must have a bond,
  colonel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined. &ldquo;I know thy mode of
  proceeding too well to dispute that point with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the rate of usance as before?&rdquo; Zachary cried,
  quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The rate of usance as before, thirty per cent&mdash;agreed!&rdquo;
  the colonel rejoined, with a sigh. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis too much! But I cannot
  help myself, and must submit to thy extortion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, but consider the risks I incur, colonel,&rdquo; the old usurer
  rejoined&mdash;&ldquo;consider the disturbed state of affairs. If we lived
  under a stable government&mdash;under a Monarchy&mdash;it might be
  different&mdash;but under a Republic&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! all knaves prosper under the Republic&mdash;to the ruin
  of honest men,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! you will ever have a gibe at the Roundheads, colonel. And I
  marvel not at it, for they have used you and your party scurvily. My own
  sympathies,&rdquo; he added, in a lower tone, &ldquo;are for the royal
  cause&mdash;but I dare not manifest them. &lsquo;Twould be my
  ruin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miserable hypocrite!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You disbelieve me. But I will give you proof of my sincerity. I
  have the lives of many a Cavalier of consequence in my power&mdash;but they
  are safe with me. And so is their royal Master, whose present retreat I
  could&mdash;if I chose&mdash;point out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mark me, Master Trangmar,&rdquo; the colonel rejoined, sternly.
  &ldquo;If the exalted personage to whom thou hast just alluded should be
  betrayed by thy instrumentality, it shall profit thee little. Nothing shall
  save thee from the sword of the avenger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would not betray him for all the wealth of the
  Commonwealth,&rdquo; the old usurer hastily rejoined. &ldquo;It was to prove
  my loyalty that I unlocked my breast to you, knowing you might be safely
  confided in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since you have said thus much, you must say yet more, and inform me
  where the royal fugitive now hides his head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so, colonel,&rdquo; Zachary rejoined. &ldquo;I can keep a
  secret as well as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you please, sir; but you must allow me to put my own
  construction on your silence. Let us conclude our business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Readily, colonel,&rdquo; the usurer returned.</p>

  <p>Upon which he unlocked the chest standing near him, and taking out a
  leather bag, placed it upon the table. Just as he had untied this bag, and
  was pouring forth its glittering contents, the door was suddenly opened by
  Skrow Antram, who entered, followed by a tall man. Almost involuntarily, the
  old usurer spread his skinny hands over the heap of gold, sharply rebuking
  Skrow for coming in unsummoned, and glancing suspiciously at the person by
  whom he was accompanied. The latter, though wearing a plain riding-dress of
  the precise Puritan cut, and mud-bespattered boots, together with a tall
  steeple-crowned hat and long cloak totally destitute of velvet and lace, had
  nevertheless a certain air of distinction, combined with great dignity of
  deportment, and might be described as looking like a Cavalier in the guise of
  a Roundhead. He was of middle age&mdash;perhaps a little past it&mdash;but
  appeared full of vigour. His features were handsome, and rather haughty in
  expression; his locks were clipped short, in puritanical fashion.</p>

  <p>The moment Colonel Maunsel cast eyes upon the stranger he knew him to be
  Lord Wilmot, the devoted attendant of the fugitive king; while on his part
  the nobleman, recognizing a friend, signed to the other not to betray any
  knowledge of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dared you admit this gentleman, Skrow? Hath he bribed you to
  let him in, eh?&rdquo; the old usurer cried, with so angry a look at the
  porter, that the latter beat a hasty retreat. &ldquo;What seek you,
  sir?&rdquo; Zachary added to the new comer. &ldquo;What business have you
  with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read that letter from Colonel George Gunter, of Racton, and you
  will see,&rdquo; was Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;He has urgent and
  immediate need of five hundred pounds, and has despatched me for
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have come on a fool&rsquo;s errand, sir,&rdquo; old Zachary
  rejoined, sharply. &ldquo;Colonel Gunter has had more money of mine than I
  shall ever see back again. I won&rsquo;t lend him another noble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read the letter before you give an answer,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot
  cried, authoritatively.</p>

  <p>While old Zachary glanced over the missive, signs like those of
  freemasonry passed between the nobleman and Colonel Maunsel, from which the
  latter understood for what purpose the money was wanted. In another moment
  the old usurer threw down the letter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lend the money,&rdquo; he cried, in an inflexible
  tone. &ldquo;You may go back to Colonel Gunter and tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dost thou not perceive that he promises to pay thee back double the
  amount in two months?&rdquo; Lord Wilmot exclaimed. &ldquo;Is not that
  enough, thou old extortioner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, but he offers me no security. He can offer none; since I hold
  the title- deeds of his whole estate in yonder press.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I must have the money, I tell thee. Much depends upon
  it,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If the kingdom depended upon it, you should not have it from
  me&mdash;without security,&rdquo; the old usurer rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will be thy security, Master Trangmar,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel
  interposed. &ldquo;This gentleman, I am well assured, is a person of honour.
  Give him the two hundred pounds you intended for me. Add other three hundred.
  Thou shalt have my bond, and further security on another farm of mine at
  Bevingdean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a true friend to the good cause, sir,&rdquo; cried Lord
  Wilmot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I begin to see what it all means now,&rdquo; the old usurer
  exclaimed, rubbing his skinny hands. &ldquo;Well, sir, who ever you may be,
  and I have an inkling that I have seen your face before, you shall have the
  money. Nay, I will go further. Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s generosity shall not
  be taxed so far as to deprive him of the two hundred pounds which he requires
  for his own use. He shall have that amount, without reference to the loan to
  your master&mdash;I crave your pardon&mdash;to Colonel Gunter.&rdquo; As he
  spoke, he again unlocked the coffer, and took out five bags. &ldquo;Each of
  these bags,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;contains a hundred pounds in gold.
  Can you carry them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will make shift to do so,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot rejoined, bestowing
  them hastily about his person. &ldquo;My friend is much beholden to you,
  Master Trangmar. Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo; he added, in a low tone, to the old
  Cavalier, &ldquo;you have rendered his Majesty a signal service, and I thank
  you heartily in his name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough, my lord,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;Farewell! Heaven
  speed you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soh! there is a visitor who has cost you a good round sum,
  colonel,&rdquo; Zachary remarked, drily, as Lord Wilmot departed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The visit will cost me nothing,&rdquo; the other returned, coldly.
  &ldquo;The money will be certainly repaid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be not too sure of that,&rdquo; the usurer said. &ldquo;One can be
  certain of nothing now- a-days. However, I can pretty well tell how it will
  be employed; and I sincerely hope it may lead to the desired
  result.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heartily hope it may&mdash;for whatever purpose it is designed.
  And now let us complete our transaction, Master Trangmar. I am somewhat
  pressed for time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will only detain you while I draw out a memorandum for your
  signature, colonel. My scrivener, Thopas Tipnoke, shall wait upon you at
  Ovingdean Grange with the bond&mdash;it will be an obligatio simplex, as
  Tipnoke would style it&mdash;and he can receive from you the title-deeds of
  your farm at Bevingdean, which you propose to deposit with me. That is
  understood, and agreed, eh? Will you please to count this gold
  &ldquo;&mdash;thrusting the heap towards him&mdash;&ldquo;and see that you
  have your just amount.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few more minutes sufficed to bring the transaction to an end. Colonel
  Maunsel signed the document prepared by the crafty usurer, who was as great
  an adept in such matters as his scrivener, Tipnoke, and received, in
  exchange, the two hundred golden caroluses. The usurer attended him to the
  door, and, just as he was about to depart, said to him, &ldquo;Let me give
  you one piece of counsel before you go, Colonel Maunsel. A rigorous search is
  about to be made of all houses in this part of the county suspected of
  harbouring fugitive Royalists, and as you are accounted&mdash;be not
  offended, I pray you&mdash;one of the most obnoxious malignants hereabouts,
  Ovingdean Grange hath the foremost place on the list. I ask you not whether
  you have any one hidden within your house? If it be so, be warned by what I
  tell you, and if you value your friend&rsquo;s life and your own safety, let
  him depart without delay. The search will be made by an officer of the Lord
  General&rsquo;s own troop of Ironsides, Captain Stelfax, who hath lately come
  to Lewes&mdash;a merciless man, with the powers of a provost-
  marshal&mdash;and if he should find an unfortunate Royalist, he would think
  no more of shooting him than of stringing up a deserter. Excuse me, colonel.
  I have thought it my duty to warn you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, good Master Trangmar,&rdquo; the old Cavalier replied,
  striving to conceal his uneasiness. &ldquo;I will take all needful
  precaution. I met this Captain Stelfax on my way hither, and he threatened me
  with a domiciliary visit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A pest upon him!&rdquo; ejaculated the old usurer. &ldquo;His
  visits are like witches&rsquo; curses&mdash;they kill. Fare you well,
  colonel. These are sad times. When good men part, now-a-days, they know not
  how, or when, they may meet again. Heaven grant his Majesty a speedy
  restoration!&mdash;and should we live to see that blessed day, you will not
  fail to tell him, I trust, who lent the five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor to mention the rate of interest exacted for the loan,&rdquo;
  rejoined the colonel, unable to repress a smile. &ldquo;Well, so thou wilt
  treat any pestilent Puritan in the same fashion, I care not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trust me, I will sweat him properly if I get such an one into my
  clutches,&rdquo; old Zachary replied, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>Upon this, Colonel Maunsel quitted Mock-Beggar Hall.</p>

  <p>On returning to the priory ruins he found Dulcia and the ostreger where he
  had left them. With Saxby&rsquo;s aid, he got once more into the saddle, and
  the party then started for Kingston, whence they mounted the steep hill at
  the foot of which the little village is nestled, and so shaped their course
  across the clowns towards Ovingdean Grange.</p>

  <p>But we must hie thither before them.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4-3"
     name="ch4-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  How Ninian Delivered His Message</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IF Ninian had been mounted upon a swift steed he could not
  have reached the Grange more quickly than he contrived to do by the use of
  his own active limbs.</p>

  <p>Not deeming it necessary to inquire whether Captain Stelfax and his
  troopers had made their appearance, for he felt certain he had beaten them,
  the young falconer&rsquo;s first business on entering the house was to seek
  out John Habergeon. As luck would have it, he found him in the buttery,
  discussing a jug of ale and a mouthful of bread and cheese&mdash;&ldquo;bren
  cheese,&rdquo; the old trooper would have termed it in his Sussex
  vernacular&mdash;with Giles Moppett and old Martin Geere, and instantly
  delivered the colonel&rsquo;s message to him, taking care to add that the
  leader of the Ironsides entertained the belief that Captain Clavering had
  been slain at Worcester.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The latter part of thy news is better than thy first, lad,&rdquo;
  John cried, swallowing down a huge mouthful, and springing to his feet
  &ldquo;Go all of ye, and spread the intelligence amongst the rest of the
  servants. Take care they are all of one story, d&rsquo;ye mind? They will be
  sharply questioned by this cursed Roundhead officer&mdash;know him well by
  report. Keep out of sight, Ninian, should the Ironsides come hither before
  the colonel returns, or they will understand that thou hast been sent on to
  give the alarm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>John then hurried upstairs, and acquainting Clavering with the message
  which had just been brought by Ninian, told him he must take instant refuge
  within the hiding-place, and remain there till the danger was passed. Seared
  by the imminence of the peril, and apprehensive of discovery, Mr. Beard
  counselled flight; but John scouted the idea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the captain to fly to?&rdquo; the old trooper cried.
  &ldquo;Were he to venture forth, those lynx-eyed Ironsides would be likely
  enough to capture him. And then that rascally Micklegift is playing the spy
  upon all our movements.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, there is another risk! How are we to guard against that?&rdquo;
  Clavering exclaimed. &ldquo;You say Micklegift is aware of my return, and
  knows I am concealed in the house. Will he not betray me to
  Stelfax?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. His lips are sealed till to-morrow,&rdquo; the old trooper
  rejoined. &ldquo;Ask me not why? I had rather not explain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have good reason for what you assert, no doubt, John,&rdquo;
  Mr. Beard remarked; &ldquo;though such tender consideration for us seems
  wholly inconsistent with Micklegift&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is perfectly consistent with his character, as your reverence
  would admit, if you knew all,&rdquo; John replied. &ldquo;But the Ironsides
  may be upon us at any moment&mdash;don&rsquo;t suppose they will give us
  notice of their approach. In with you, captain,&rdquo; he continued, touching
  the secret spring in the mantelpiece, and disclosing the entrance to the
  place of concealment. &ldquo;You have all you require, and are provisioned
  for a week. Don&rsquo;t be disheartened, if we should be unable to
  communicate with you for some time; and let no summons&mdash;no
  alarm&mdash;induce you to come forth. Mind that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will obey your directions implicitly, John,&rdquo; the young man
  said. &ldquo;Yet my mind misgives me, and I enter this retreat with
  reluctance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a good heart, sir,&rdquo; John cried, cheerily. &ldquo;All
  will turn out well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven grant it!&rdquo; Mr. Beard ejaculated, fervently.
  &ldquo;Place yourself under the care of Providence, my son; and my prayers
  shall also be offered for your safety.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this, Clavering passed through the aperture, and the next moment the
  pillar was returned to its place.</p>

  <p>It was time. Scarcely had Clavering made good his retreat, when the blast
  of a trumpet was heard outside the house, proclaiming the arrival of the
  Ironsides.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4-4"
     name="ch4-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  In What Manner The Captain Of The Ironsides<br>
  Employed His Time At The Grange</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT this fearful summons, old Martin Geere, Giles Moppett,
  and some others rushed to the door, and to their great dismay, found the
  house invested by a troop of armed men, who, having ridden through the
  gateway, were now drawn up before the porch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What ho, fellow!&rdquo; cried their red-bearded leader, addressing
  Martin. &ldquo;We are come to pay thy master a visit, as thou
  seest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and your men are right welcome, worshipful captain, and my
  master, I am sure, will feel greatly honoured,&rdquo; old Martin rejoined;
  &ldquo;but he is from home at the moment, hawking on the downs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is at Lewes, thou shouldst say, for I left him riding thither
  scarce an hour ago with the Episcopalian divine&rsquo;s comely
  daughter,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined. &ldquo;As to welcome, we should have
  little enough, I warrant me, either from thee or from thy master, if we could
  not enforce it. But my men are hungry, and would eat; thirsty, and would
  drink&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They shall have the best the house affords, worshipful
  captain,&rdquo; old Martin hastened to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They ever do have of the best when they pay a malignant a
  visit,&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax, laughing. &ldquo;Your substance hath been
  delivered into our hands, and wherefore should we hesitate to take it? I
  shall tarry here until thy master returns, for I have to interrogate
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Giving the word to his men to dismount, Stelfax next directed two of them
  to stand at the door, and suffer no one to go forth. Every other outlet from
  the house was to be similarly watched: the guard to be relieved every
  half-hour, so that no man might be deprived of his share of the creature
  comforts to be found within. Sergeant Delves was instructed to take the
  horses to the stables, see them foddered, and then rejoin his leader.</p>

  <p>All these orders given, Captain Stelfax sprang from his saddle, and,
  marching into the entrance-hall, made the whole place resound with his
  clattering sword and heavy boots. Old Martin Geere and the others kept at a
  respectful distance, anxiously watching him.</p>

  <p>On reaching the middle of the hall, the formidable leader stood still, as
  if uncertain in which direction he should first bend his steps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will it please you to enter the banqueting-room, or the library,
  worshipful captain?&rdquo; Martin Geere inquired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall enter every room in the house in turn,&rdquo; Stelfax
  rejoined; &ldquo;but I care not if I begin with the
  banqueting-room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A small collation shall be served there in a moment,
  captain,&rdquo; said Giles Moppett.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap, your worship may like a cup of Bordeaux, or of Gascoigne
  wine?&rdquo; insinuated Elias Crundy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring a flask of the best wine thou hast in thy cellar,
  fellow,&rdquo; returned Stelfax; &ldquo;and broach a cask of thy stoutest ale
  for my men&mdash;unless they prefer wine, in which case thou wilt give it
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They shall have whatsoever they ask for, of that your worship may
  rest assured,&rdquo; Elias said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or your own skins will suffer for it, I promise thee,&rdquo;
  Stelfax rejoined. &ldquo;It seems, then, that you have not heard that the
  rebellious malignant, your young master, was slain at Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alack! worshipful captain, we have heard the sad tidings,&rdquo;
  answered Martin Geere, in a doleful tone; &ldquo;but we have not ventured to
  tell the colonel. Poor gentleman! the news will break his heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tut! thou art mistaken,&rdquo; Stelfax cried. &ldquo;I told him of
  the occurrence myself, and he seemed more surprised than grieved. But who
  brought you the news?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An old trooper of King Charles&rsquo; time, John Habergeon,
  captain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the knave? Bring him before me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, he marched into the banqueting-hall, and flung himself into the
  arm- chair usually occupied by the colonel. In hopes of mollifying the
  formidable intruder, Giles Moppett and Elias Crundy both bestirred
  themselves, and speedily set wine and eatables before him. But this did not
  pacify the captain, for he roared out, &ldquo;Why comes not the rogue
  Habergeon to me? Must I go fetch him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am here, captain,&rdquo; John responded, entering the
  banqueting-room. &ldquo;What would you with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Close behind the old trooper came Sergeant Delves, who had just returned
  from the stables. Stelfax looked sternly at John, who stood bolt upright
  before him, never moving a muscle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou shouldst have been a soldier of the Commonwealth,
  fellow,&rdquo; observed the Roundhead captain, approvingly&mdash;&ldquo;thou
  hast the look of an Ironside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; John replied. &ldquo;Your honour
  might not deem it a compliment were I to say that you are too well-looking
  for a Puritan, and have more the air of a roystering Cavalier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to, knave, and liken me not to a profane follower of
  Jehoram,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, not altogether displeased. &ldquo;Take heed
  that thou answerest me truthfully. Thou art newly returned from that
  battle-field whereat the Young Man, Charles Stuart, was utterly routed, and
  where our great general, like Pekah, the son of Remaliah, slew many thousands
  of men of valour in one day because they had forsaken the Lord God of their
  fathers. Didst thou bear arms in the service of Ahaz?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I followed my young master&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who paid the penalty of his rebellious folly with his life&mdash;I
  know it. But I demand of thee if thou wert actually engaged in the
  strife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tried to rescue my young master when he was stricken from his
  horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thy efforts were futile. He was justly slain, forasmuch as he
  hearkened not unto the words of Necho, but came to fight in the valley of
  Megiddo. However, I blame not thy fidelity, and it is well for thee that we
  take not account of the units of the host, but only of the captains. Thou
  owest thy safety to thine insignificance. But if thou art ever again caught
  in arms against the Commonwealth, a rope&rsquo;s end will be thy quittance.
  Had thy young master been living, I might have spared him the ceremony of a
  court-martial, my power being absolute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is well for him that he is out of your honour&rsquo;s
  reach,&rdquo; returned John.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Therein thou sayest truly, fellow,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined, with a
  laugh. &ldquo;Well, I have done with thee for the nonce. I will question thee
  further when the profane malignant, thy old master, returns from his ride.
  Meantime, thou art a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A prisoner!&rdquo; John Habergeon exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, all within the house are prisoners during my tarrying here.
  None may stir forth on peril of life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Mr. Beard and Increase Micklegift entered the room.
  Having witnessed the arrival of the troopers from the parsonage-house, the
  Independent minister had come over to watch their proceedings. John Habergeon
  having informed the Roundhead captain who the new-comers were, the latter
  prayed them to be seated, and addressed himself to the ejected clergyman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your daughter is a comely damsel, Master Beard,&rdquo; he
  said&mdash;&ldquo;a very comely damsel. I met her a short while ago, on the
  other side of the downs, in Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She went out to ride with my honoured patron,&rdquo; Mr. Beard
  replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have been told, I doubt not, of the death of your
  patron&rsquo;s son&mdash;the young malignant, Clavering Maunsel?&rdquo;
  pursued Stelfax.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been told of it,&rdquo; Mr. Beard replied, casting down his
  eyes, for it was painful to him to equivocate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this I hear?&rdquo; Micklegift exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The young man was slain at Worcester.&rdquo; Stelfax remarked, in
  an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That cannot be!&rdquo; the Independent minister cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wherefore can it not be, I prithee?&rdquo; Stelfax retorted.
  &ldquo;I say unto thee again, the young man is dead and buried.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou thinkest so?&rdquo; said Micklegift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I am certain of it,&rdquo; the other rejoined. &ldquo;There is
  small chance of his rendering further service to the Young Man, Charles
  Stuart. But I was speaking of your daughter, sir,&rdquo; he added to Mr.
  Beard. &ldquo;She deserves a good husband. Have you ever thought of giving
  her away in marriage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; the clergyman replied. &ldquo;She is yet of
  tender age, and I look to her as the prop of my declining years&mdash;should
  I be spared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you know not what may befall you,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined.
  &ldquo;A wise man will provide against the evil day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your counsel is good, valiant captain,&rdquo; Micklegift remarked.
  &ldquo;And Master Beard will do well to commit his daughter to the care of
  some godly and discreet man, who will be as a safeguard to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like thyself,&rdquo; John Habergeon muttered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, were I Master Beard,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, &ldquo;I would
  rather give her to some man with a strong hand, who having carved his way
  with the sword, will maintain what he hath won with the same
  weapon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! is this Roundhead captain too a suitor?&rdquo; John Habergeon
  muttered. &ldquo;We shall have the pair at daggers drawn ere long,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This man is my rival,&rdquo; Micklegift mentally ejaculated;&rsquo;
  his pale features flushing angrily. &ldquo;I must thwart his
  designs.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I like not this Independent minister,&rdquo; Stelfax muttered to
  himself. &ldquo;He is not a true man. I must keep an eye upon him. Well,
  Master Beard,&rdquo; he added, aloud, to the clergyman&mdash;&ldquo;are you
  disposed to follow my recommendation, and bestow fair Mistress Dulcia upon a
  man of might and valour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or on a man of wisdom and godliness?&rdquo; Micklegift said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His reverence must be hard put to it to answer them,&rdquo; John
  muttered, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall leave the choice to my daughter,&rdquo; the clergyman
  replied, gravely; &ldquo;and until she consults me on the subject, I shall
  give no thought to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A seasonable relief was unexpectedly offered to Mr. Beard at this
  juncture. A great disturbance was heard in the corridor, and the next moment
  two troopers entered, dragging in Ninian, with his hands bound behind his
  back with a leathern thong, and followed by Patty Whinchat, sobbing
  loudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How now, Besadaiah Eavestaff, and thou, Tola Fell,&rdquo; Stelfax
  cried, addressing the troopers, &ldquo;what hath this varlet done, that ye
  bring him thus bounden before me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hath assaulted our comrade, Helpless Henly, and smitten him on
  the head with a bill-staff,&rdquo; Besadaiah replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Helpless Henly much hurt?&rdquo; Stelfax demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I cannot avouch that,&rdquo; Besadaiah replied.
  &ldquo;Luckily, he hath a thick skull. But the blow was delivered with right
  good will, and felled him to the ground.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What caused the attack?&rdquo; sternly demanded Stelfax.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was the unlucky cause of it, an please you, worshipful
  captain,&rdquo; sobbed Patty. &ldquo;the soldier wanted to kiss me whether I
  would or not; so I cried out, and Ninian came to my assistance,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;that was all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not quite all, my pretty damsel,&rdquo; Stelfax said.
  &ldquo;What place dost thou fill in the establishment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That of handmaiden to Mistress Dulcia, an please you, worshipful
  captain,&rdquo; Patty rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mistress Dulcia is well served, I warrant her,&rdquo; Stelfax
  remarked, with a smile. &ldquo;Take the varlet forth,&rdquo; he added to the
  troopers, &ldquo;and belabour him soundly with your scabbards for ten
  minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, spare him!&mdash;spare him!&rdquo; Patty implored, throwing
  herself on her knees before the captain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get up, Patty,&rdquo; Ninian cried, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t ask pity
  of him. I would sooner die than do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This fellow is thy sweetheart&mdash;as the phrase goes with you
  profane folk&mdash;is he not?&rdquo; cried Stelfax.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is, an please you, captain. Spare him! spare him! I am in fault,
  not he!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, thou hast won him grace,&rdquo; Stelfax replied, chucking her
  under the chin. &ldquo;I marvel not that Helpless Henly was tempted by those
  cherry lips. Beshrew me, but thou art a pretty lass&mdash;almost as comely as
  thy mistress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is ever the way with the captain,&rdquo; grumbled Eavestaff.
  &ldquo;Like Samson the Nazarite, the son of Manoah, any wanton Delilah can
  prevail over him. Shall we unloose the varlet&rsquo;s bonds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yea, verily,&rdquo; Stelfax replied. &ldquo;Yet stay!&rdquo; he
  continued, looking hard at Ninian. &ldquo;This must be the knave whom I
  encountered with the malignant colonel, at the foot of Kingston Hill. There
  must have been a strong motive for his expeditious return. I will soon find
  it out,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Render an account of thyself,
  fellow. Why wert thou sent on by thy master?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To see all made ready for you, captain,&rdquo; Ninian answered,
  promptly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it,&rdquo; Stelfax remarked, drily. &ldquo;And
  thou hast done thy best to carry out the order. Wert thou to get thy deserts,
  thou shouldst have double the number of stripes I just now ordered thee; but
  thou art free. Thou owest thy liberation to this pretty damsel. Let him not
  out of your sight,&rdquo; he added to the troopers, as they undid the
  thong.</p>

  <p>With a covert glance at Ninian, which seemed to say &ldquo;Forget not what
  I have just done for you!&rdquo; Patty Whinchat hastily disappeared.</p>

  <p>Filling a large silver flagon, holding well-nigh a quart, with Bordeaux,
  Stelfax emptied it without drawing breath; pronounced the wine good; and
  then, getting up, expressed his intention of forthwith searching the house.
  He ordered John Habergeon and Ninian to attend him, but made no objection to
  the company of Mr. Beard and Micklegift, who proffered to go with him.
  Sergeant Delves and the two troopers brought up the rear. Old Martin Geere
  joined the party in the hall, and on seeing him, Stelfax cried out,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go fetch thy keys quickly, thou Pharaoh&rsquo;s butler. I will have
  every room and every closet&mdash;ay, and every secret place&mdash;opened
  unto me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are no secret places that I wot of, worshipful
  captain,&rdquo; old Martin replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou liest!&rdquo; Stelfax exclaimed, fiercely; &ldquo;and I will
  make thee show them to me, or thou shalt have the thumbscrew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While old Martin, in a state of great trepidation, hurried off to obey the
  terrible captain&rsquo;s behest, the latter marched into the library, and
  glanced around it, making contemptuous observations on many of the objects
  that met his view. He had just finished his scrutiny when Martin came back
  with a large bunch of keys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will begin with the ground floor,&rdquo; Stelfax said.
  &ldquo;Conduct me to the kitchen and cellars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old serving-man bowed and led the way to the back part of the house,
  Stelfax and the others following him, with the exception of Mr. Beard and the
  Independent minister, who stayed in the entrance-hall. As Stelfax passed the
  buttery, he perceived half a dozen troopers seated at a table, with
  well-laden trenchers and large mugs before them. Amongst them was a great
  brawny-looking fellow, with his head tied up with a napkin, through which the
  blood had oozed. This was Helpless Henly. To judge from the expeditious
  manner in which Henly was clearing his trencher, he was not much worse for
  his broken pate. On seeing Ninian, the injured Ironside sprang to his feet,
  and drawing his tuck from its scabbard, would have spitted him as completely
  as the jack heron had recently transfixed the poor tartaret, but for the
  interference of his captain, who ordered the fellow to sit down again&mdash;a
  command which he obeyed with ill- concealed discontent, and muttered
  threatenings at Ninian.</p>

  <p>The next visit was paid to the kitchen, where other troopers were
  discovered, similarly employed to those in the buttery. A brace of them,
  having satisfied their appetites, were seated near the fire, smoking their
  pipes, and watching the merry movements of the active little turnspit in his
  box. Stelfax tarried no longer in the kitchen than allowed him time to number
  the household, and put a few questions to them.</p>

  <p>Next came the cellar. A short flight of steps conducted the searchers into
  an extensive range of vaults with strong stone walls and arches calculated to
  sustain the weight of the superincumbent structure. Nothing, however, could
  be discovered within these subterranean chambers more dangerous than certain
  hogsheads of ale placed within the arched recesses. Nor, when the wine
  cellars were unlocked, was anything to be discovered except a goodly supply
  of long- necked, cobwebbed flasks quietly reposing in their bins. These
  bottles offered too strong a temptation to the troopers to be resisted. Each
  of them, including Sergeant Delves, took toll from the bins, carrying off a
  plentiful supply for themselves and their comrades. No notice of the
  spoliation was taken by their leader.</p>

  <p>The cellar doors being locked, the searchers returned to the buttery,
  where the wine was put aside by the purloiners for future consumption, and
  this precaution taken, the Roundhead captain intimated his intention of
  visiting the upper rooms. Upon which, they repaired to the entrance-hall,
  where they found Mr. Beard and Micklegift, and after examining several other
  apartments on this floor, the whole party went upstairs.</p>

  <p>Every room in the upper story, large and small&mdash;with one
  exception&mdash;was carefully searched; every closet unlocked; every place,
  likely, or unlikely, to conceal a fugitive, inspected. The apartments
  allotted to Mr. Beard and his daughter underwent the same rigorous scrutiny;
  even Dulcia&rsquo;s sleeping-chamber was not respected. In this latter
  apartment Patty Whinchat had sought refuge, hoping to escape further
  molestation, and she was greatly alarmed when Stelfax and the Ironsides burst
  upon her retreat. The Roundhead captain, however, sought to reassure her, and
  thrusting out his followers, claimed a kiss as the reward of his liberation
  of Ninian. Of course, Patty could not refuse the request. Neither did she
  exhibit quite so much disinclination to the red- bearded captain&rsquo;s
  salute, as she appeared to have done in the case of Helpless Henly.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s chamber was reserved to the last. Refusal to admit
  the searchers within it would have instantly awakened suspicion, so old
  Martin had no alternative but to open it for them.</p>

  <p>On entering the room, Stelfax uttered an exclamation which filled John
  Habergeon with misgiving. But the trusty old fellow took heart when the
  searchers marched into the inner room, and proceeded to its careful
  examination. The hangings were pulled aside; the old oak armoire was opened;
  the closets peered into&mdash;but nothing was found.</p>

  <p>John began to hope that the danger was over. But all his fears revived
  when Stelfax, throwing himself into the colonel&rsquo;s elbow-chair, and
  fixing his eyes upon the great mantelpiece, exclaimed in a loud voice to
  Sergeant Delves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring hither hammer, hatchet, lever, chisel, and auger. I have work
  for you to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4-5"
     name="ch4-5">CHAPTER V<br>
  Showing How Increase Micklegift<br>
  Did A Turn To Clavering</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As this terrible order was issued, and the sergeant and the
  two troopers went forth to execute it, anxious looks were furtively exchanged
  by the Royalists, who now gave up Clavering for lost. These glances did not
  escape Stelfax, though he feigned not to perceive them, but smiled to
  himself. For one moment it occurred to John Habergeon to make an attack upon
  the Roundhead captain, and by the sacrifice of his own life possibly ensure
  Clavering&rsquo;s escape. But he was deterred by Mr. Beard, who, reading his
  desperate purpose in his looks, laid his hand upon his arm, and besought him
  in a low tone to forbear.</p>

  <p>Secretly enjoying the consternation he had occasioned, Stelfax now arose
  from the chair, and marched to the window as if to look out at the garden,
  but really to indulge in a quiet laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If we could only get him out of the room for one minute, before the
  others return, Captain Clavering might be saved,&rdquo; John Haber-geon
  whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see not how that can be accomplished,&rdquo; groaned Mr. Beard.
  &ldquo;The poor young man is lost. What will his unhappy father say when he
  returns?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot bear to think of it,&rdquo; John returned, with a look of
  anguish. &ldquo;Cost what it may, an effort must be made to save
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I may help you in this extremity,&rdquo; said Micklegift, in a low
  tone to John. &ldquo;You will not forget the service?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; John returned, emphatically&mdash;&ldquo;never! But
  what you do must be done quickly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a moment shall be lost on my part,&rdquo; Micklegift rejoined.
  And he moved towards the Roundhead leader.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Methinks you did not sufficiently examine yon further closet,
  captain,&rdquo; Micklegift observed. &ldquo;In my opinion it hath a false
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must have quicker eyes than I have, to have made that
  discovery, Master Preacher,&rdquo; Stelfax cried, falling at once into the
  snare. &ldquo;However, I will go see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will show you what I mean,&rdquo; said the Independent divine,
  preceding him to the closet.</p>

  <p>As he entered the recess with Stelfax, the Independent divine cast a
  significant look at John, the import of which the latter at once
  comprehended.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art lighter of foot than I, Ninian,&rdquo; he said to the
  young falconer. &ldquo;Fly to yon closet!&mdash;the key is luckily in the
  door&mdash;lock them in!&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ninian needed not second bidding. Stealing swiftly and noiselessly to the
  closet-door, he clapped it to suddenly, and locked it, almost before Captain
  Stelfax, who was at the further end of the deep recess, could turn round.</p>

  <p>Infuriated at the successful trick played upon him, the Roundhead leader
  dashed himself with all his force against the door; but it was of solid oak,
  and resisted his efforts. He then roared out to the Royalists to set him
  instantly free, threatening them with his direst vengeance if they refused;
  but so far from attending to him, Ninian very coolly took the key out of the
  lock, saying, with a laugh, &ldquo;If you wait till I let you loose, captain,
  you will wait long enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meantime, John Habergeon had not been idle. So soon as Stelfax was
  secured, he rushed to the mantelpiece, touched the secret spring, and putting
  his head into the aperture, called to Clavering to come forth without an
  instant&rsquo;s delay.</p>

  <p>The young man at once obeyed the summons. The noise made by the searchers
  had reached him in his retreat, and guessing the cause, he prepared to stand
  upon his defence, resolved not to surrender with life. Happily, his
  resolution was not put to the test.</p>

  <p>In a few words John Habergeon explained to him what had occurred. But
  though he was free, escape might be rendered impracticable by the return of
  the troopers. What was to be done next? To get out of the house seemed almost
  impossible. Every outlet, as John knew, was guarded. Still, something must be
  done&mdash;and quickly. No mercy was now to be expected from the maddened
  Roundhead leader, who was hammering and hacking at the door with his sword,
  and making a terrific disturbance.</p>

  <p>John&rsquo;s brain was usually fertile in expedients, but he was at his
  wits&rsquo; end now, when Ninian, coming up to them, recalled his
  energies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you loiter?&rdquo; the young falconer cried, impatiently
  &ldquo;Those cursed troopers will be back in a moment, and Captain Clavering
  will be caught.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But all the doors are guarded!&rdquo; John cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except the door of this room, and that will serve our turn,&rdquo;
  Ninian answered, with a laugh. &ldquo;Come with me, and I will show you how
  to get out of the house, in spite of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have with you then,&rdquo; cried Clavering. &ldquo;Will you not
  come with us, sir?&rdquo; he added to Mr. Beard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, my dear son,&rdquo; the clergyman said. &ldquo;Do you seek
  safety in flight; I will abide here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better come, reverend sir,&rdquo; John cried. &ldquo;Yon
  savage Roundhead is no respecter of persons, and will show little
  consideration for your holy calling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will withstand his malice,&rdquo; Mr. Beard answered, resignedly.
  &ldquo;Do not concern yourselves about me. Go!&mdash;and Heaven guard
  you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quick! quick! or you will be too late!&rdquo; cried Ninian, who had
  partly opened the door. &ldquo;Methinks I hear them coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make sure that we may venture forth,&rdquo; cried Clavering. Ninian
  stepped out into the gallery, and reported that no one was there, but that he
  could hear the voices of the troopers in the hall below. On this assurance,
  Clavering and John Habergeon instantly went forth, closing the door after
  them.</p>

  <p>Left alone, the good clergyman sat down, and strove to prepare himself for
  the scene which he expected to ensue. All the time, Stelfax continued
  battering at the closet door, and vociferating loudly.</p>

  <p>Ere long, Sergeant Delves and the two troopers entered the room, bearing
  the implements for breaking open the mantelpiece. They were surprised on
  seeing only Mr. Beard, and at a loss to account for their leader&rsquo;s
  disappearance, for Stelfax had momentarily ceased his clamour&mdash;probably
  from exhaustion. However, he presently renewed it, and with greater fury than
  ever, and then Sergeant Delves, beginning to comprehend what had occurred,
  rushed up to the clergyman, and, seizing his shoulder, shook him violently,
  exclaiming,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! thou perfidious and dissembling Episcopalian, hast thou
  entrapped our leader, a mighty man of valour like Amasiah, the captain of
  Jehoshaphat, and fastened him within yon closet? Give me the key thereof
  instantly, or I will smite thee with the edge of the sword, even as the false
  priests of Baal were put to death by the soldiers of Jehu.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To do me injury will advance thee little, friend,&rdquo; replied
  Mr. Beard, firmly. &ldquo;I have not the key. Thou wert better liberate thy
  captain thyself. Thou hast the means of doing so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Apparently, the sergeant thought the advice good, for he called out to
  Captain Stelfax that assistance was at hand, which had the effect of
  tranquillizing him. Delves next directed his men to burst open the
  door&mdash;a task which they easily accomplished.</p>

  <p>Thus liberated, the Roundhead captain strode forth, sword in hand, and
  foaming with rage, followed by Micklegift, who maintained the most perfect
  composure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis as I expected!&rdquo; Stelfax cried, looking around, and
  seeming only Mr. Beard; &ldquo;the treacherous rogues have fled. But they
  shall not escape me. They cannot have quitted the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible, captain,&rdquo; Sergeant Delves rejoined. &ldquo;Every
  issue is guarded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will have them, alive or dead!&rdquo; cried Stelfax. &ldquo;Get
  thee downstairs quickly, Delves, and give the alarm to thy comrades. Bid them
  be on the alert. If any one attempts to escape, let him be shot down. Bring
  up half a dozen men with you. We will search the house from top to bottom but
  we will find them. Some one must have been concealed within this
  chamber&mdash;perchance the Young Man, Charles Stuart, himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! say you so, captain?&rdquo; Delves exclaimed. &ldquo;That were
  a prize, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, &lsquo;tis mere conjecture,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined, somewhat
  hastily. &ldquo;Yet &lsquo;tis certain one has been hidden here. Away with
  thee downstairs, and leave me to question this Episcopalian
  preacher.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And as Delves departed, the Roundhead captain marched up to Mr. Beard, and
  shaking him as roughly as the sergeant had done, fiercely demanded who had
  been concealed in the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will answer no questions,&rdquo; Mr. Beard replied, meekly but
  firmly; &ldquo;so you may spare yourself the trouble of interrogating
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will find a way of making thee speak, thou perverse and purblind
  zealot,&rdquo; Stelfax roared. &ldquo;Think not I will show thee mercy
  because of thy comely daughter. Thou shalt undergo the torture. My men shall
  put jagged rings upon thy limbs that shall pierce deeply into the flesh. Thy
  legs shall be thrust into an iron boot that shall crush bone and marrow, and
  make thee lame for life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All this you may do, and more, as your savage nature may
  suggest,&rdquo; the clergyman said, firmly; &ldquo;yet shall you not force me
  speak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see presently,&rdquo; Stelfax cried. &ldquo;I ask thee
  again, who has been concealed in this room?&mdash;the Young Man, Charles
  Stuart, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Beard made no reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put on the thumbscrew, Tola,&rdquo; Stelfax said. &ldquo;I will
  waste no more time with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold, captain,&rdquo; Micklegift interposed. &ldquo;I will not
  permit this worthy man to be tortured.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt not permit it! ho! ho!&rdquo; Stelfax exclaimed, in a
  jeering tone. &ldquo;In what way wilt thou prevent it? Withdraw, if thou
  carest not to see my order executed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I will not withdraw. I protest against thy cruel order,&rdquo;
  Micklegift cried, resolutely. &ldquo;I lift up my voice against it, and if
  thou harmest this good man, thou and thy men will repent it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard enough,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, fiercely. &ldquo;Thrust
  him from the room, and obey my order.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will resist them&mdash;yea, I will resist them with force,&rdquo;
  said Micklegift.</p>

  <p>The troopers hesitated, not liking to lay hands upon the Independent
  minister.</p>

  <p>At this moment the door opened, and Colonel Maunsel and Dulcia entered the
  room. The old Cavalier looked pale as death, and greatly agitated. He cast an
  anxious look around, as if apprehensive that his son&rsquo;s retreat had been
  discovered. Dulcia was equally alarmed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father! my father!&rdquo; she shrieked, flying towards the poor
  clergyman.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="bk5"
     name="bk5">BOOK V. FOX AND WOLF</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch5-1"
     name="ch5-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  How Clavering Came Down The Chimney;<br>
  And How Mickelgift Lent Him Aid<br>
  For The Second Time</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ILL news travels quickly. Colonel Maunsel was warned of the
  danger awaiting him, long before he reached the Grange. Some half-dozen loyal
  villagers mounting the down at the rear of the mansion, stationed themselves
  near the old barrow, and as soon as they descried the little party descending
  the gorse- coloured slopes of the furthest hill on the north-west, they ran
  to meet the colonel, and gave him the alarming intelligence that his
  habitation was in the hands of the Ironsides, every door guarded, and no one
  allowed to come forth. The faithful rustics, of course, were unable to state
  what had taken place inside the house, or what discoveries had been made, but
  enough was related to fill the colonel with deepest disquietude:&mdash;the
  only relief to his anxiety being afforded by the certitude which he likewise
  derived from his informants that Ninian had reached the Grange before the
  enemy.</p>

  <p>On approaching Ovingdean, the loyal rustics took leave of the old Cavalier
  and Dulcia, who proceeded to the mansion. Dismounting at the porch, and
  giving their horses to Eustace Saxby, they both went in, no hindrance being
  offered by the sentinels posted at the door.</p>

  <p>Old Martin Geere met them in the entrance-hall&mdash;his wobegone looks
  announcing disaster. The old serving-man, we may remark, dreading lest he
  should betray himself by some indiscreet observation, had quitted the
  colonel&rsquo;s chamber before Stelfax was entrapped by the agency of
  Micklegift, and consequently he could give no account of that occurrence, or
  what had followed it; but he knew enough to heighten his master&rsquo;s and
  Dulcia&rsquo;s alarm, and fearing the worst&mdash;the worst with them being
  the discovery of Clavering&rsquo;s hiding-place&mdash;they hurried upstairs,
  entering the room, as previously narrated, at the moment when. Increase
  Micklegift interposed to prevent Mr. Beard from undergoing the torture.</p>

  <p>Their entrance operated as a check upon the threatened violence. At the
  sight of Dulcia, Stelfax, by a sudden effort, constrained his wrath; while
  the two troopers involuntarily drew back as the shrieking maiden rushed up to
  Mr. Beard, and flung her arms around his neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What would these barbarous men do to you, my father?&rdquo; she
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They would torture him,&rdquo; Micklegift replied, answering for
  Mr. Beard, whose agitation almost deprived him of the power of utterance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Torture an unoffending clergyman&mdash;an old
  man&mdash;impossible!&rdquo; cried Dulcia, in an agonized voice. &ldquo;Cruel
  as they are, they cannot mean it. They must have some respect for
  religion&mdash;some reverence for grey hairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! they have none, my child,&rdquo; Mr. Beard observed.
  &ldquo;Neither my age nor my sacred calling would have protected me from
  outrage, but for this good man&rsquo;s interposition.&rdquo; And, as he
  spoke, he cast a grateful look at Micklegift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this so?&rdquo; cried Dulcia to Stelfax. &ldquo;Do you still
  hold to your savage purpose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I meant but to work upon thy father&rsquo;s fears, damsel, and
  so extort a confession from him,&rdquo; the Ironside captain replied.
  &ldquo;I did not design to proceed to extremities with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven alone can read our secret thoughts,&rdquo; observed
  Micklegift, in a tone of incredulity. &ldquo;But thy part was so well played,
  that at least it imposed upon me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stelfax bent his brows, but took no other notice of the observation.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel had not hitherto spoken, but had looked on in the utmost
  anxiety, being ignorant, of course, of his son&rsquo;s evasion. He now
  addressed himself to Stelfax, in the hope of eliciting some information from
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You spoke of confession, sir,&rdquo; he said to the Roundhead
  leader. &ldquo;What hath Mr. Beard to reveal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall learn presently, Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo; the other
  rejoined, sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, he shall learn at once,&rdquo; Micklegift interposed.
  &ldquo;The valiant captain hath been locked in yonder closet, and waxing
  wroth at his confinement, he visited his anger on Master Beard&rsquo;s head,
  charging the unoffending old man with aiding a fugitive to escape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How know&rsquo;st thou Master Beard is unoffending?&rdquo; Stelfax
  cried. &ldquo;Thou wert shut up with me in the closet, and couldst not tell
  what took place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; the old Cavalier exclaimed, a sudden light breaking upon
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The valiant captain seems to suspect that a proscribed malignant
  hath been concealed within this room,&rdquo; Micklegift continued, with a
  significant look at Colonel Maunsel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am certain of it,&rdquo; the Roundhead leader returned;
  &ldquo;and I begin to suspect it was by thy instrumentality, master preacher,
  that he hath escaped.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could that be, seeing I was with thee in the closet?&rdquo;
  Micklegift rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might easily be&mdash;since it was by thy device that I was led
  into the snare. Bitterly shalt thou rue it, if I find thee leagued with the
  Amalekites.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let it be proven that I am leagued with them,&rdquo; Micklegift
  rejoined, &ldquo;and I will abide any punishment thou mayst choose to inflict
  upon me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Proof that thou art in concert with the enemies of the Commonwealth
  may appear hereafter,&rdquo; Stelfax retorted. &ldquo;Meantime, I have a
  question to put to you, Colonel Maunsel, whereunto I demand a distinct
  answer. Hath Amon, the son of Manasseh, whose provocations kindled the wrath
  of the Lord God against Judah&mdash;hath Amon, I say, taken refuge in thy
  house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not feign to misunderstand you,&rdquo; the old Cavalier
  rejoined. &ldquo;But were it as you suspect, think you I would betray
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You prevaricate, and convert my doubts into certainties,&rdquo;
  cried Stelfax. &ldquo;The Young Man hath been here&mdash;nay, is here
  still&mdash;for he cannot have eluded the vigilance of the sentinels. Are you
  aware, Colonel Maunsel, that a Proclamation was posted this morning at your
  gate, to the effect that whosoever shall harbour Charles Stuart shall be held
  guilty of high treason? Did you read that Proclamation?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did, and would have trampled it beneath my feet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The punishment of high treason is death, colonel&mdash;death on the
  scaffold! Forget not that,&rdquo; Stelfax said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall but die as my Master died, if I so perish,&rdquo; the old
  Cavalier rejoined.</p>

  <p>Just then, Sergeant Delves entered the room, and the half-opened door
  afforded a glimpse of several other troopers standing without in the
  gallery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The men await your orders, captain,&rdquo; said the sergeant,
  advancing towards his leader.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; Stelfax answered. &ldquo;Before I proceed to the
  search Colonel Maunsel, it is right you should know that two of your
  retainers, John Habergeon and Ninian Saxby by name, have aided and abetted in
  this attempted escape of a concealed traitor and enemy to the Commonwealth.
  If they fall into my hands I shall show them little grace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven grant them a deliverance!&rdquo; murmured the colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued Stelfax, &ldquo;I must see the
  hiding-place within yon chimney. Will you show me the entrance to it
  voluntarily, or must my men break down the mantelpiece? See it I
  will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel hesitated, uncertain how to act.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Advance, men&mdash;to your task!&rdquo; Stelfax said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed. And stepping towards the
  hearth, he touched the secret spring, and the pillar flew back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An ingenious contrivance, truly,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, with a
  laugh; &ldquo;but you must have a better device than this to delude me. Give
  me thy pistol, sergeant,&rdquo; he continued, taking the weapon from Delves.
  &ldquo;I will go in myself. Guard thou the entrance. I will not be entrapped
  a second time.&rdquo; So saying, he stepped into the recess, while Delves
  planted himself outside it.</p>

  <p>Nothing was said during the brief absence of the Ironside leader. Colonel
  Maunsel, though almost confident of his son&rsquo;s escape, was not wholly
  free from uneasiness, while Dulcia glanced anxiously and inquiringly at her
  father, who strove to reassure her with his looks.</p>

  <p>In another moment, Stelfax came forth again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The bird has flown,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the nest is yet
  warm. He cannot be far off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fugitives cannot have left the house, captain&mdash;of that I
  am certain,&rdquo; Delves remarked. &ldquo;No one has come down
  stairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall discover them, I doubt not,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined.
  &ldquo;Visit yon inner chamber once more, and then we will search
  elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sergeant did as directed, and made a rigorous but unsuccessful
  investigation of the apartment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not expect any one would be found there,&rdquo; Stelfax said;
  &ldquo;but nothing must be neglected. You, Colonel Maunsel, and all of
  you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;will remain prisoners for the present within
  this chamber&mdash;with the exception of Master Increase Micklegift, who is
  at liberty to depart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I will tarry where I am,&rdquo; the Independent minister
  rejoined.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Stelfax seemed disposed to insist upon his departure, but,
  changing his mind, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Tarry here if thou wilt. Sentinels
  will be placed at the door, and will suffer no one to go forth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this, he quitted the room with Delves, and the door was closed upon
  the prisoners. As soon as this was done, Micklegift approached the old
  Cavalier, and said to him, &ldquo;Not altogether unjustly did yon man of
  wrath tax me with leaguing with your party. Your son owes his safety to me.
  But for my timely aid he would be now in the hands of his enemies, and you
  are aware how he would have been dealt with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is quite true, worthy sir,&rdquo; Mr. Beard subjoined.
  &ldquo;Good Master Micklegift must be regarded as your son&rsquo;s preserver,
  as he has since been my defender from violence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you from my heart, sir,&rdquo; the colonel said, warmly.
  &ldquo;I have been much mistaken in you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank the worthy man, my child,&rdquo; Mr. Beard said to Dulcia.
  &ldquo;We are all greatly beholden to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has my thanks,&rdquo; Dulcia replied, unable to overcome her
  strong aversion to Micklegift; &ldquo;and I trust he has been influenced by
  good motives in what he has done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should you mistrust him, my child?&rdquo; her father remarked,
  somewhat severely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, wherefore shouldst thou doubt me, maiden?&rdquo; Micklegift
  said, in a half- reproachful tone, And bending his head towards her, he
  whispered, &ldquo;This have I done for thy sake&mdash;and I will do yet more,
  if thou dost desire it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dulcia made no reply, but cast her eyes upon the ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take comfort, worthy sir, I entreat you,&rdquo; Mr. Beard said,
  noticing that the colonel seemed still a prey to keen anxiety. &ldquo;All may
  yet be well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not till I am assured of my son&rsquo;s safety shall I feel
  relief,&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined. &ldquo;Little has yet been gained.
  &lsquo;Tis a mere escape from one room to another. Flight from the house,
  guarded as it is, is next to impossible, and I know not where concealment can
  be found within doors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Concealment will not be attempted, I apprehend, sir,&rdquo; Mr.
  Beard remarked. &ldquo;Ninian seemed confident of getting out of the house
  secretly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he so?&rdquo; cried the colonel. &ldquo;Then I have better
  hopes. Some plan may have occurred to him which does not occur to me.
  Hist!&mdash;did you not hear a noise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only the trampling of heavy feet as the Roundhead soldiers move
  from chamber to chamber,&rdquo; Mr. Beard replied. &ldquo;Pray Heaven your
  son escape them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven, in its mercy, shield him!&rdquo; Dulcia cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The noise grows louder!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel. &ldquo;A
  struggle seems to be taking place in the room overhead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Unable to repress an ejaculation of terror, Dulcia fell upon her knees,
  and prayed audibly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Methinks the sound comes from the chimney!&rdquo; Micklegift
  cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From the chimney!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, advancing towards
  the fireplace, followed by the Independent minister. &ldquo;You are right.
  Some one is coming down,&rdquo; he added, stooping to look up the
  chimney-funnel. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; replied the voice of Ninian. &ldquo;Is the coast
  clear? May we come down?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Powers of mercy!&rdquo; the old Cavalier ejaculated. &ldquo;Can it
  be? Is my son there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the colonel who speaks,&rdquo; Ninian said, evidently
  addressing some one above him. &ldquo;Yes, yes, the captain is here. Is all
  safe below?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;yet stay! those ruthless Ironsides may return!&rdquo;
  the old Cavalier cried.</p>

  <p>But before the latter part of his exclamation could be uttered, Ninian
  dropped lightly on the hearth.</p>

  <p>A glance satisfied the young falconer that all was secure. He turned,
  therefore, and calling up the funnel, &ldquo;You may come down,
  captain,&rdquo; assisted another individual to descend, and in a trice
  Clavering stood before his father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My son! my dear son!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel, transported with
  delight at beholding him.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had Clavering and Ninian quitted the hearth than John Habergeon
  landed in safety, and stepped out into the room.</p>

  <p>By this time Clavering and Dulcia were together&mdash;the latter weeping
  with delight on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The enemy are searching the house for you,&rdquo; Dulcia cried. How
  did you manage to escape them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&mdash;not so loud,&rdquo; Micklegift said, stepping softly
  towards the door; &ldquo;you will be overheard by the sentinels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We put ourselves under the guidance of Ninian,&rdquo; Clavering
  said, in reply to Dulcia&rsquo;s inquiry, &ldquo;and by his aid got upon the
  roof, and so reached this chimney, which he declared had holdings with inside
  for the feet by which we could descend. It turned out as he stated; but the
  descent would have been impracticable on my part, helpless as I am, but for
  John Habergeon&rsquo;s support. We meant to lurk within the chimney till the
  search should be over, when Ninian heard my father&rsquo;s voice&mdash;and so
  here we are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But here you must not remain,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;The
  baffled Ironsides may return at any moment. What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can we not conceal ourselves behind the hangings in the inner
  room?&rdquo; cried Clavering. &ldquo;One of us might take refuge in the
  armoire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no! that would be too dangerous!&rdquo; John Habergeon
  exclaimed. &ldquo;Could we but reach the garden!&mdash;That window is a good
  height from the ground, it is true, but I could drop from it and break no
  bones&mdash;and so could Ninian&mdash;but the fall wouldn&rsquo;t suit
  Captain Clavering&rsquo;s injured arm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think not of me, John,&rdquo; the young Cavalier cried, resolutely.
  &ldquo;I am ready to make the attempt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be useless,&rdquo; Ninian said, cautiously approaching the
  window and looking forth; &ldquo;there is a red-coat, with a musket on his
  shoulder, on guard below.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pest on him!&rdquo; John ejaculated. &ldquo;We must e&rsquo;en
  climb the chimney again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; cried Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be ruled by me, and enter the hiding-place in which you originally
  took refuge,&rdquo; said Micklegift, advancing towards them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The captain of the Ironsides has already searched it, and will not,
  in all likelihood, visit it again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The worthy man speaks the truth!&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel exclaimed.
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the safest place to be found. We are beholden to you for
  the suggestion, good Master Micklegift. Enter the recess, my son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not go there,&rdquo; Dulcia cried, detaining Clavering. &ldquo;I
  distrust this man. He will betray you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since you doubt me, damsel,&rdquo; said Micklegift, &ldquo;let the
  youth stay here, and be the consequences on your head. He will not have to
  tarry long, for methinks I hear the footsteps of his foe without.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you keep him back, Dulcia?&rdquo; the colonel cried,
  impatiently. &ldquo;Worthy Master Micklegift is perfectly right, and I owe
  him a large debt of gratitude for twice saving my son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spare your thanks, Colonel Maunsel, till the danger be past,&rdquo;
  the Independent minister rejoined. &ldquo;Seek the refuge I have pointed out
  to you, young man&mdash;or stay and brave your fate. But hesitate not. In
  another moment you will have no choice left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was wrong!&mdash;go!&mdash;go!&rdquo; cried Dulcia to Clavering,
  who still looked irresolute.</p>

  <p>At her entreaty he moved towards the hiding-place, the entrance to which
  had already been thrown open by Ninian, who had gone in. John Habergeon stood
  outside on the hearth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come! come! captain,&rdquo; the old trooper cried, impatiently. One
  would think you were desirous of being captured. In with you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this, Clavering entered the recess, and John quickly following him,
  the pillar swung back to its customary position.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5-2"
     name="ch5-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  How Mickelgift Was Ignominiously Expelled From The Grange</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SCARCELY had all been made secure, when the chamber-door
  suddenly opened, and a sentinel entering, cast a sharp inquisitive look
  around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Methought I heard a noise,&rdquo; he observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst hear my voice in exhortation, friend,&rdquo; Micklegift
  said. &ldquo;Remain here, and I will hold forth to thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my post is without,&rdquo; the trooper rejoined. And thinking
  all was right, he went forth, closing the door after him.</p>

  <p>For some time no other interruption occurred. Micklegift became somewhat
  assiduous in his attentions to Dulcia, and she, knowing that
  Clavering&rsquo;s life was in his hands, did not venture to manifest the
  repugnance she felt towards him. Not for an instant, however, did she stir
  from her father&rsquo;s side. Mr. Beard took little part in the conversation,
  and, indeed, scarcely noted what was said. Colonel Maunsel withdrew into the
  inner room, and sinking into a chair, gave way to painful reflection.</p>

  <p>Thus more than an hour passed, and still Stelfax returned not. Thrice
  during the interval&mdash;long it seemed to the expectants&mdash;had a
  sentinel entered the room. Although the imprisoned Royalists knew that the
  search would prove ineffectual, intense anxiety was felt by them as to how
  the Roundhead leader would bear his disappointment. In his anger he might
  resort to measures of increased severity. The savage character of the man
  warranted such a conclusion.</p>

  <p>At length, the sound of heavy footsteps were heard within the gallery,
  followed by the grounding of arms, and the stern voice of the captain of the
  Ironsides could be distinguished, as he questioned the sentinels. Presently
  afterwards he entered the room. Rage and disappointment were written in his
  features, and he glanced fiercely at the group before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Colonel Maunsel?&rdquo; he demanded, in a harsh voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; the old Cavalier answered, rising from his seat,
  and advancing towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may not, perchance, surprise you, Colonel Maunsel, to be told
  that my search&mdash;strict though it has been&mdash;has proved
  fruitless,&rdquo; pursued the Ironside captain; &ldquo;but though foiled for
  the moment, I am not to be beaten, as you will find to your cost. Three
  persons have escaped me&mdash;two of your own retainers, and a third person,
  hidden within this room, whose flight has been traitorously abetted. Now,
  mark me, colonel. I know you to be proud and stiff-necked, like all your
  rebellious party; but regard for self may sway you. The three persons I have
  alluded to are still in your house. Produce them, and you will save me some
  trouble and yourself vexation. Refuse, and I shall take other three persons
  in their stead, to be dealt with as the authorities may see fit. You
  yourself, colonel, will be one of my prisoners.&rdquo; And he slightly paused
  to note the effect of his words upon the old Cavalier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Proceed, sir,&rdquo; said the other, firmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The second person I shall take will be Master Beard,&rdquo; pursued
  Stelfax, speaking with great deliberation. &ldquo;The third will be his
  daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His daughter!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel, starting. &ldquo;You
  dare not do it. On what pretence would you make her a prisoner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I render an account of my actions to those only who have the right
  to question me, colonel,&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax, &ldquo;and such is not your
  case. It will be painful to act thus harshly, I admit; but you enforce
  severity upon me. Deliver up the three men to me, and I depart at once,
  without offering you further molestation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do so,&rdquo; groaned the colonel&mdash;&ldquo;I would
  not, if I could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, there the truth came out,&rdquo; Stelfax retorted, with a
  bitter laugh. &ldquo;That you can produce them if you will, I wot full well.
  It grieves me to the soul to deal harshly with this comely and delicate
  damsel. That I am forced to do so is owing to perverseness on your
  part&mdash;not to want of humanity on mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Affect not to feel for me, I pray you, sir,&rdquo; cried Dulcia.
  &ldquo;Your pity is unneeded and unsolicited. If Colonel Maunsel and my
  father are made prisoners, I desire to go with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make yourself easy, my child,&rdquo; Mr. Beard said. &ldquo;This
  man will not venture to stretch his authority so far. He cannot mean to do as
  he avouches.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not mean it!&rdquo; Stelfax echoed, in a jeering tone; &ldquo;you
  will see anon whether I mean what I say or not, Master Beard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least give ear unto me,&rdquo; said Micklegift, advancing
  towards</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace! I will not listen to thee,&rdquo; cried Stelfax,
  roughly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet have I something to say unto thee to which thou wilt willingly
  attend,&rdquo; said Micklegift, in no wise abashed by the other&rsquo;s
  rudeness. &ldquo;It is not meet that this damsel should be made thy
  captive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Intercede not for me, I entreat you, sir?&rdquo; cried Dulcia,
  fearing that he meditated treachery. &ldquo;If my life is to be sacrificed, I
  will give it cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, your life is not endangered, maiden,&rdquo; said Stelfax;
  &ldquo;merely your liberty&mdash;for the which, I repeat, you have to thank
  Colonel Maunsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say unto thee again, captain, the damsel&rsquo;s liberty must
  not, and shall not be constrained,&rdquo; said Micklegift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold thy peace, I say! thou froward fellow,&rdquo; cried Stelfax.
  &ldquo;The damsel herself desires not thy mediation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I do not,&rdquo; implored Dulcia. &ldquo;Beseech you, good
  sir, let the matter be,&rdquo; she added to Micklegift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hearest what she says,&rdquo; cried Stelfax. &ldquo;Trouble me
  no further.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not let the matter be,&rdquo; exclaimed Micklegift. &ldquo;I
  tell thee, for the third time, thou shalt not take the damsel. Even if she
  would go freely with thee, she shall not do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This passeth all endurance,&rdquo; roared Stelfax, stamping his
  foot with rage. &ldquo;What ho! guard!&rdquo; he shouted. And half a dozen
  troopers instantly answering the summons, he continued, &ldquo;Seize this
  pestilent fellow who hath dared to wag his evil tongue against me, and
  disputeth my authority. Thrust a kerchief into his mouth to stop his
  mischievous clamour. Cast him from the house&mdash;and suffer him not, on any
  pretence, to enter it again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Ironside leader&rsquo;s injunctions were instantly obeyed.
  Micklegift&rsquo;s arms were seized and pinioned behind his back, while a
  cloth thrust into his mouth prevented his utterance. In this guise, and
  exposed to further ill-usage as he was forced out of the room and hurried
  down stairs, he was kicked out of the house, amidst the jeers of the troopers
  and of such of the household as witnessed his ignominious expulsion.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5-3"
     name="ch5-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  How The Captain Of The Ironsides Took<br>
  Possession Of The Colonel&rsquo;s Chamber</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No one among the Royalists, except good Mr. Beard, regretted
  the summary dismissal of the Independent minister. Dulcia, indeed, regarded
  his ejection as a most fortunate deliverance, being convinced that he was
  about to betray Clavering, when his design was frustrated by the Roundhead
  leader&rsquo;s unwillingness to listen to him.</p>

  <p>Captain Stelfax&rsquo;s secret object, however, was to get rid of one whom
  he looked upon as a troublesome rival. Having accomplished his purpose, he
  withdrew to the further end of the room, where he held a long consultation
  with Delves. The old Cavalier, who watched them narrowly, was at no loss to
  understand from the captain&rsquo;s gestures that he was discussing the
  possibility of the fugitives still being concealed within the chamber; and it
  was with no little alarm that at one moment he perceived the glances of both
  the Ironsides directed towards the mantelpiece. But his alarm was dispelled
  as quickly as it arose. Stelfax shook his head as if to intimate that no one
  could have found refuge there.</p>

  <p>His conference ended, the captain of the Ironsides marched up to the old
  Cavalier, and said, &ldquo;I have resolved upon remaining here till
  to-morrow, Colonel Maunsel, and if by that time the three persons I have
  demanded from you be not delivered up to me, I shall be compelled to execute
  my threat in respect to yourself, Master Beard, and his daughter. If you are
  put to inconvenience in finding accommodation and provisions for my men, you
  must not blame me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am in your power, sir, and must perforce submit,&rdquo; the
  colonel replied. &ldquo;What is your further pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax. &ldquo;I have no particular orders
  to give. My men must be well fed, and well lodged&mdash;but they will see to
  those matters themselves&mdash;and it will be best to content them. As to
  myself, I shall merely require this room for my occupation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This room!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, visibly embarrassed.
  &ldquo;Will none other serve your turn? This is my own
  sleeping-chamber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must resign it to me for to-night, colonel,&rdquo; Stelfax
  rejoined; noticing, with secret satisfaction, the other&rsquo;s dismay.
  &ldquo;I have taken a fancy to it, and cannot study your
  convenience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it seems, sir,&rdquo; said the old Cavalier, feeling that
  remonstrance would be useless, and perhaps dangerous. &ldquo;You will not
  object, at least, to my making some little arrangements within the chamber,
  and removing a few trifling articles before you take possession of
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly not,&rdquo; Stelfax replied. &ldquo;Remove what you
  please, colonel. But what you do must be done in my presence, or in the
  presence of Sergeant Delves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I find I am indeed a prisoner,&rdquo; sighed the colonel,
  &ldquo;since my every movement must needs be watched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Recollect that you yourself render this rigour necessary,&rdquo;
  Stelfax rejoined; &ldquo;and thank me that I deal not more harshly with you.
  For you, fair damsel,&rdquo; he added to Dulcia, &ldquo;you are at liberty to
  retire to your own apartment, if you are so minded. But forget not that you
  are a prisoner to the house; and if summoned to my presence, fail not in
  prompt attendance. Master Beard, you can go with your daughter&mdash;on the
  same conditions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not venturing to remain after this dismissal, Dulcia and her father
  reluctantly, and full of misgiving, withdrew.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel hoped that he might have been left alone within the
  chamber for a few minutes, and so snatch an opportunity of communicating with
  those within the hiding-place; but this being denied him, he would fain have
  tarried within the room. But here again his wishes were defeated, for Stelfax
  soon afterwards signified to him, in a tone that left no alternative but
  compliance, that he might retire. The only favour he could obtain was
  permission to send Martin Geere for such articles as he might require for the
  night. This accorded, he withdrew.</p>

  <p>It was not without considerable trepidation that old Martin executed his
  master&rsquo;s orders; and, on returning to the library, whither the colonel
  had repaired, the old serving-man reported that Stelfax had caused a great
  wood fire to be lighted, before which he was comfortably seated&mdash;a piece
  of intelligence which did not tend to mitigate the old Cavalier&rsquo;s
  anxiety, since it decreased the chances of his son&rsquo;s escape.</p>

  <p>Deeply did Colonel Maunsel now regret that he was deprived of the
  assistance of John Habergeon, whose shrewdness might have helped him at this
  fearful emergency. But John was a prisoner as well as Clavering; and as to
  poor old Martin Geere, he was so bewildered as to be utterly incapable of
  lending efficient assistance. Resignation, therefore, was all that was left
  to the old Cavalier. He tried to calm himself, but in vain. Suspense and
  anxiety quite overmastered him, and reduced him at last to a state of almost
  stupor.</p>

  <p>If the colonel was plunged into the depths of gloom and despondency,
  Dulcia and her father were scarcely less miserable. In vain the good
  clergyman sought to console his daughter. His arguments fell upon deaf ears.
  The poor damsel&rsquo;s faculties were be-numbed by terror, and for some time
  she scarcely gave a token of consciousness&mdash;all the efforts of her
  father and Patty Whinchat failing to rouse her.</p>

  <p>And now to glance at the Ironsides. As may be supposed, the troopers were
  by no means displeased by the information that they were to pass the night at
  the Grange. Like true soldiers, they knew right well when they were in good
  quarters, and were in no hurry to depart. The supplies of the larder and the
  buttery, notwithstanding the large demands made upon them, were by no means
  exhausted; and if this stock of provisions should fail, there were sides of
  bacon, hams, and cheeses in reserve within the store-room&mdash;while poultry
  and pigeons in any quantity could be had from the farmyard. Ale and wine were
  unstinted. Yet with all this indulgence there was no relaxation of
  discipline. The sentinels were changed every hour, and constant and strict
  watch was kept at all the points of the house.</p>

  <p>It being the object of the household to keep their unwelcome guests in
  good burnout, everything was done to promote this object. Accordingly, Giles
  Moppett, Elias Crundy, with the cook and the scullion-wenches, were
  unremitting in their efforts to please the redcoats, whom Moppett privately
  declared to be as ravenous as wolves, and as thirsty as camels. On their
  part, the Ironsides did not give way to any great licence, and took care not
  to drink to excess, but they smoked incessantly, and made the whole house
  reek like a tavern with the fumes of tobacco. They went about where they
  listed, without displaying much respect for the persons they encountered.
  Thus, three or four of them, smoking of course, entered the library where the
  unhappy colonel was seated, and, regardless of his looks of anger and
  disgust, continued to puff away at their pipes as they leisurely examined the
  portraits on the walls, or other objects that attracted their attention,
  passing unseemly comments upon them. One of them&mdash;it was Helpless
  Henly&mdash;taking up the Eikon Basilik, tore the book asunder in a rage,
  and flung the fragments into the fire. Besadaiah Eavestaft and Tola Fell
  intruded themselves in the same way upon Mr. Beard, and one of them being a
  Fifth Monarchy Man, and the other a Muggletonian, they sat down, and sought
  to enter into a controversy with him. Doubtless, Dulcia, who withdrew with
  Patty, on the appearance of the two troopers, into an inner apartment, would
  have been subjected to like annoyance, but that Captain Stelfax had given
  express orders that her privacy should be respected.</p>

  <p>As to the Ironside leader himself, he remained for more than two hours in
  the colonel&rsquo;s chamber, where, as we have already stated, he caused a
  wood fire to be lighted, and where subsequently a copious repast was served
  him, of which he partook. His meal ended, it occurred to him to make an
  external examination of the house; but, on going forth, he did not allow the
  room to remain untenanted, leaving Sergeant Delves and three troopers within
  it, and giving them strict orders on no account to go forth, even for a
  moment, until his return.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5-4"
     name="ch5-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  Of The Message Sent By Micklegift To Stelfax;<br>
  And Of The Plan For Ensnaring The Fugitives<br>
  Devised By The Latter</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALL the sentinels were at their posts as Stelfax went his
  rounds, and nothing to excite suspicion had occurred. He next visited the
  stables, and, as matter of precaution, directed that his own charger, and
  half a dozen troopers&rsquo; horses, should be kept saddled and bridled. This
  done, he proceeded to the garden, in order to study the architecture of the
  back part of the mansion. The massive chimney in which the lurking-hole was
  contrived stood on this side of the building, and projected far from the
  wall, rising from its base in gradations like those of a buttress. Stelfax
  easily made out the position of the hiding-place, but could detect no other
  recess of the kind. He was in the act of measuring the projection of the
  chimney, when Helpless Henly brought word that two persons were at the outer
  gate, desiring speech with him. On inquiry, these individuals proved to be
  Nehemiah Lift-up-hand and Lawrence Creek. Stelfax consenting to see them,
  Henly departed, and presently returned with the two men. Very grave
  salutations passed between the Ironside leader and his visitors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have come to thee, valiant captain,&rdquo; premised Nehemiah,
  who acted as spokesman, &ldquo;on behalf of the godly Master Increase
  Micklegift, to remonstrate with thee on thy behaviour towards him, and to see
  if thou wilt make him some amends for the maltreatment he hath
  received.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye will lose your labour, good sirs,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined,
  sternly. &ldquo;I will make Master Increase Micklegift no amends. I have
  driven him from the house, and forbidden him to return to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This we know, captain,&rdquo; said Nehemiah, &ldquo;and we grieve
  that thou shouldst have so far stretched thy authority against the good man.
  He meant thee well, and in his humility and Christian charity is willing to
  overlook the dishonourable treatment he hath experienced, and to be
  reconciled unto thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rejoice to hear it,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined. &ldquo;Is this the
  sum of his message to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, captain,&rdquo; said Nehemiah. &ldquo;The good man wishes to be
  allowed to confer with thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A mere pretence to obtain admission to the house,&rdquo; thought
  Stelfax. &ldquo;He desires to confer with me, thou sayest?&rdquo; he added
  aloud. &ldquo;On what matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I am not in his confidence, valiant captain,&rdquo; Nehemiah
  replied; &ldquo;but I know that his business is of moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ere I make a reply, I would put a question to thee in my turn, good
  master messenger. Said he aught to thee concerning the daughter of the
  Episcopalian divine, Master Beard?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yea, verily, he told me thou hadst threatened to take her away as
  thy captive,&rdquo; Nehemiah answered. &ldquo;But he added, that he felt
  assured thou wouldst not carry thy menace into effect, inasmuch as he could
  show thee cogent reasons against it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what, I prithee, were those weighty reasons of his, good master
  messenger? Did he mention them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hinted, as the phrase is, that he had an offer to make to thee,
  provided thou wouldst engage to leave the damsel unmolested.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax. &ldquo;Take back my answer,
  good master messenger, and say unto Micklegift that I reject his proposal,
  whatsoever it may be. I will have nought to do with him. He is faithless and
  perverse, and in league with the Amalekites, and if he presents himself again
  within this dwelling while I am here, I will cause him to be driven forth
  with blows and fustigation. Say this to him, without
  circumlocution.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since thou thinkest thus unjustly of the worthy man, captain,
  nothing more can be said,&rdquo; Nehemiah rejoined. &ldquo;I scarcely like to
  add what he desired us to declare unto thee in case a deaf ear should be
  turned to his remonstrances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forbear not out of consideration to me, I prithee, good master
  messenger&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined. &ldquo;Speak out, and fear not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thus, then, spake he, captain,&rdquo; Nehemiah rejoined, boldly.
  &ldquo;He offers you friendship and aid; but if you reject them, you may
  count upon his enmity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I laugh at his threats, good master messenger,&rdquo; Stelfax
  rejoined. &ldquo;Go tell him so, and rid me of your presence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We grieve that our mission to thee has failed,&rdquo; said Lawrence
  Greek. &ldquo;Fear not our troubling thee again, for we are both about to
  depart, on the instant, from this village of Ovingdean. Fare thee well,
  captain. Peradventure, thou mayst regret thou didst not listen to the
  peacemakers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this the two men departed; while the Ironside leader turning
  impatiently on his heel, strode off in a different direction across the
  grass-plot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A pertinacious and malicious knave this Mickelegift!&rdquo;
  ejaculated Stelfax, as he continued angrily to pace the sward, &ldquo;and
  doubtless he will do me an ill turn if he can; but I despise him. The pitiful
  varlet hath the presumption to aspire to the hand of the lovely Dulcia; but
  even if she would listen to his suit&mdash;which is most unlikely&mdash;he
  shall never have her. No; she shall be mine. Of that I am resolved. No damsel
  hath ever pleased me so much. She seems to scorn me, but I will find means to
  bend her stubborn spirit. Ah! I have it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his eye
  kindling, as a plan suddenly flashed across him. &ldquo;She shall help me to
  discover those I seek. They are in that room, I am certain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No sooner was the plan formed than it was acted upon. Reentering the
  house, he went upstairs to the old Cavalier&rsquo;s chamber, and ordered
  Delves to summon Colonel Maunsel, with Mr. Beard and Dulcia, to his
  presence.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the three persons thus sent for made their appearance,
  preceded by the sergeant, and guarded by half a dozen troopers, armed with
  carabines, among whom were Besadaiah, Tola, and Helpless Henly. The lynx-eyed
  captain of the Ironsides watched the Royalists closely on their entrance, and
  detected certain glances from which he drew tolerably correct inferences.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall have the fugitives now,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

  <p>Clothing his countenance with its most awful frowns, Stelfax strode up to
  the little group, and said, in a threatening voice, &ldquo;I have sent for
  you, Colonel Maunsel, to put an end to this business. I perceive that I have
  been trifled with, and am therefore resolved to pursue a different course. I
  ask you, for the last time, will you deliver up these fugitives to
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have but one answer to give to the question,&rdquo; the old
  Cavalier said, &ldquo;and that is a refusal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you likewise persist in refusing to disclose their
  hiding-place, eh, Master Beard?&rdquo; pursued Stelfax.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the clergyman answered, firmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My final appeal must be made to you, damsel,&rdquo; the Ironside
  captain went on; &ldquo;and I would fain hope that you may spare me from a
  painful task which stern duty imposes. By enabling me to secure these
  fugitives&mdash;who can be nothing to you&mdash;nothing in comparison, I
  mean&mdash;you will save Colonel Maunsel and your father from the
  torture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From torture!&rdquo; ejaculated Dulcia, in affright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heed not what this crafty and cruel man says to you, Dulcia,&rdquo;
  cried the colonel, &ldquo;and let not a word escape your lips that may
  imperil those whose lives hang on your firmness. He dares not put his threat
  in execution.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dares not!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax. &ldquo;Look you, Colonel
  Maunsel, I have already been told in this very room that I dare not execute
  my threats, but the time is come when you will find out your error. My
  warrant is not from the Parliament, or even from the Council, but from the
  Lord General himself, and I am empowered by it to deal with refractory
  malignants as I see fit&mdash;as I see fit, colonel&mdash;there is some
  latitude in that phrase, methinks! If I think fit to shoot you in your own
  court-yard, or to hang you at your own gate, I can do it, and my warrant will
  bear me out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt not that the murderer of his most sacred Majesty will
  absolve his followers from any crime, however foul,&rdquo; rejoined the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That taunt may cost you your life, sir,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined.
  &ldquo;But it is to you, damsel, and not to this imprudent man, that I
  address myself,&rdquo; he added to Dulcia. &ldquo;Must I send forth Colonel
  Maunsel and your father to endure the torture?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;no! I implore you to spare them!&rdquo; she
  cried, falling on her knees before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must shut my heart to your entreaties, damsel,&rdquo; Stelfax
  said. &ldquo;Speak! and I show pity&mdash;not otherwise!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be firm, Dulcia,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel exclaimed. And a like
  injunction was laid upon her by her father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cannot have the heart to carry out your threat?&rdquo; Dulcia
  said, rising to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is only one way to move me,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice,
  and catching her arm. &ldquo;Be mine!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yours!&rdquo; she exclaimed, regarding him with mixed disgust and
  terror, and almost doubting whether she had heard aright. &ldquo;Yours!
  Never!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reflect!&rdquo; he said, under his breath. &ldquo;I love you to
  desperation. Be mine, and they are safe. Nay, I will depart without further
  search.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! merciful Heaven! what have I done to deserve this trial?&rdquo;
  Dulcia ejaculated. &ldquo;Tempt me not,&rdquo; she added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say the word, and it is done, according to my promise!&rdquo;
  Stelfax whispered, thinking he had prevailed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say it,&rdquo; she rejoined, in a tone of anguish.
  &ldquo;Whatever may happen, I can never be yours. I would die a hundred
  deaths first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough, proud damsel!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You shall find
  what it is to brave my displeasure. Sergeant Delves,&rdquo; he continued, in
  an inflexible tone, &ldquo;take these two malignants to some lower chamber
  suitable for the purpose. Let both undergo the torture of the boot, unless
  the first to endure the pain shall reveal where the fugitives are hidden.
  Begin with Colonel Maunsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! no, for pity&rsquo;s sake, spare them!&rdquo; cried Dulcia,
  again falling on her knees before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arise, Dulcia, I command you,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel cried.
  &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he added to Mr. Beard, &ldquo;the base rebels and
  regicides shall find how little power hath torture over a loyal English
  gentleman, ever prepared to die for his king; and upon a clergyman of
  England&rsquo;s true Church, whose life has been spent in his Maker&rsquo;s
  service. They shall not wring a groan from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor from me,&rdquo; Mr. Beard said, with equal firmness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Away with them, and put their boasted resolution to the
  proof!&rdquo; cried Stelfax, forcibly disengaging himself from Dulcia.</p>

  <p>Overcome by terror, the distracted damsel uttered a scream that made the
  whole chamber ring with its piercing sound. Full of the deepest
  commiseration, her father and Colonel Maunsel, who were moving on towards the
  door under charge of Delves and the troopers, turned to look at her; but
  their attention was instantly diverted to another object. That cry of agony
  had summoned other actors to the scene. Scarcely had it ceased, when the
  pillar masking the secret entrance to the hiding-place flew back, and
  Clavering Maunsel stepped forth. He was quickly followed by John Habergeon
  and Ninian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; Stelfax exclaimed, with an exulting laugh.
  &ldquo;Here are the men I want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On sight of Clavering, Dulcia started to her feet, and flew towards him,
  while he, yielding to irrepressible emotion, and seemingly insensible to the
  peril in which he stood, pressed her to his bosom.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Stelfax regarded the young man narrowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is not Charles Stuart!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Who art
  thou?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no longer any motive for concealment,&rdquo; the other
  answered. &ldquo;I am Clavering Maunsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clavering Maunsel!&rdquo; echoed the Roundhead leader, in surprise.
  &ldquo;Then the report that thou wert slain at Worcester was
  false?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was false, since you behold me here,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Imprudent boy!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, in accents of mingled
  grief and reproach. &ldquo;Thou hast doomed thyself to
  destruction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! I am to blame!&rdquo; Dulcia exclaimed. &ldquo;I have
  been the means of betraying him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, that is quite certain,&rdquo; Stelfax remarked, with a bitter
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so! not so!&rdquo; cried Clavering to Dulcia. &ldquo;From yon
  hiding-place I overheard what was passing here; and think you I would have
  allowed my father and your father to undergo the torture on my account? I
  only waited till the last moment, in the hope that this dastardly villain
  would not execute his threat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Learn, then, that my order would not have been executed,&rdquo;
  Stelfax replied, with a derisive laugh. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas but a device to
  lure thee from thy secure retreat, and it has succeeded. Ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! unhappy boy, why did you come forth?&rdquo; groaned the old
  Cavalier. &ldquo;Your retreat, you see, was not suspected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, in good sooth it was not,&rdquo; Stelfax said. &ldquo;Having
  myself searched the burrow and found it empty, I did not suppose it would be
  again occupied; nor can I conceive how the young man and his companions found
  access to it, unless they came down the chimney. Ah, I have hit upon the way
  taken, I find!&rdquo; he exclaimed, perceiving a smile cross Ninian&rsquo;s
  countenance. &ldquo;Possibly, if you had remained quiet, you might have got
  off,&rdquo; he added to Clavering; &ldquo;but it is too late to think of that
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not too late to sell our lives dearly,&rdquo; the young
  Cavalier cried, brandishing his sword with the only arm capable of wielding
  the weapon. &ldquo;You, John, will stand by me&mdash;and you also,
  Ninian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the last!&rdquo; they both responded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! that I had my trusty sword in my grasp!&rdquo; added John
  Habergeon.&rdquo; I would quickly cut a way through them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give fire if they stir!&rdquo; Stelfax shouted to the troopers.</p>

  <p>And the carabines of the Ironsides were levelled at the young Cavalier and
  his companions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am the cause of your destruction. It is meet I should die with
  you,&rdquo; cried Dulcia, still clinging to Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; thundered Stelfax to his followers. &ldquo;That damsel
  must not be injured. Upon them, and disarm the young man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is needless,&rdquo; cried Clavering, throwing down his sword.
  &ldquo;I yield myself a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sdeath! captain, wherefore did you yield?&rdquo; John
  Habergeon grumbled. &ldquo;Why not let us fight it out? We can but die
  once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And never better than now,&rdquo; added Ninian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is useless to struggle against destiny,&rdquo; Clavering
  cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, it is quite evident that Providence&mdash;or, as you profanely
  say, Destiny&mdash;is against you and your party,&rdquo; Stelfax observed.
  &ldquo;The Lord has declared himself on the side of those who observe his
  commandments. Remove these men!&rdquo; he added to Delves.</p>

  <p>At the word, the troopers surrounded the prisoners, none of whom offered
  any resistance, though both John Habergeon and Ninian eyed their captors
  fiercely. Dulcia, however, still clung despairingly to Clavering, while
  Delves sought, though with much forbearance, to remove her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, Dulcia!&rdquo; Clavering cried, straining her to his
  heart. &ldquo;This is my last embrace. We shall meet no more on
  earth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must we part thus!&rdquo; she exclaimed, distractedly. &ldquo;May I
  not go with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your presence would only distract his thoughts from preparation for
  the death he will speedily have to encounter, damsel,&rdquo; the captain of
  the Ironsides remarked. &ldquo;His life is justly forfeited for treason and
  rebellion against the Commonwealth, and it were idle to hold out any hope of
  mercy. Assuredly, none will be shown him. Better for himself he had died, as
  I deemed he had, at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Clavering, mournfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There must be an end of this leave-taking, damsel,&rdquo; Stelfax
  cried, with fierce impatience. &ldquo;Bid him farewell, and for
  ever!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dulcia made an effort to speak, but the words expired upon her lips, and
  she fell, insensible, into Clavering&rsquo;s arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give her to me, and move on,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, advancing to
  take the fainting maiden from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Off!&mdash;touch her not!&rdquo; cried Clavering. &ldquo;Here, sir,
  take her,&rdquo; he added to Mr. Beard, who came up at the moment.</p>

  <p>Sad was it to see the inanimate girl consigned to her father&mdash;sad to
  behold Mr. Beard&rsquo;s agonized countenance&mdash;sadder yet to mark
  Clavering&rsquo;s look of utter despair as he so relinquished her.</p>

  <p>Colonel Maunsel appeared as if thunderstricken&mdash;almost unconscious of
  what was passing around him. He had sunk, in a heavy, despairing, listless
  state, into a chair; and it was only when the prisoners were being led forth
  by the guard that he roused himself,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, my dear father,&rdquo; said Clavering, pausing, and
  regarding him piteously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What say&rsquo;st thou, my son?&rdquo; the old Cavalier rejoined,
  passing his hands over his eyes to clear his vision. &ldquo;Where goest
  thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To my last fight,&rdquo; Clavering replied, &ldquo;where I trust I
  shall comport myself as courageously and as well as our martyred king did
  upon the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! are they taking thee to execution?&rdquo; cried his father,
  the dreadful truth rushing suddenly upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not to present execution, as I judge, sir,&rdquo; Clavering
  answered. &ldquo;I would it were so, for I am a-wearied of life. But you know
  what mercy is to be expected from these regicides. Give me your blessing ere
  I go forth,&rdquo; he added, bending the knee to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have it, my son! exclaimed the old Cavalier, extending his arms
  over his head. May the Father of Heaven, who supported our blessed king in
  his last hour, support thee in thine!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Delay no longer, sergeant,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, wishful to
  interrupt the scene. &ldquo;Remove the prisoners, and wait my further orders
  in the hall of entrance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this, Clavering arose, and tearing himself from his father&rsquo;s
  embrace, moved on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, your honour,&rdquo; said John Habergeon, halting a moment
  by his old master. &ldquo;Give yourself no concern about me. I shall die a
  dog&rsquo;s death at the hands of these cursed rebels&mdash;but what matters
  it? I have ever been a loyal subject to my king, and a faithful servant to
  the best of masters, and that will be my consolation at my last hour. May I
  take your hand at parting?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, my faithful servant,&rdquo; the old Cavalier replied,
  warmly grasping John&rsquo;s rugged hand; &ldquo;we shall not be long
  separated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It were but mockery to wish your honour long continuance in a world
  like this, where only roguery prospers&mdash;you were better out of
  it,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;So, I hope we may soon meet in a place where
  rebels and regicides will never enter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; the colonel responded; &ldquo;farewell, John! And
  farewell to thee, too, my poor fellow!&rdquo; he added to Ninian, as the
  latter came up. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a pity thou shouldst be out off thus early.
  But they may spare thee on the score of thy youth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not ask grace at their hands on that plea&mdash;or any
  other,&rdquo; Ninian replied, resolutely. &ldquo;Trust me, I will not
  discredit your honour&rsquo;s house. My last cry shall be,&rsquo; Confusion
  to old Noll, and long life and a speedy Restoration to the lawful ruler of
  this realm, his most sacred Majesty King Charles the Second!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gag him, if he dares give utterance to further treason,&rdquo;
  roared Stelfax, furiously. &ldquo;Away with them at once, sergeant! Wherefore
  dost thou suffer them to abuse my patience thus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this, Delves put the men in motion, and conducted the prisoners down
  the principal staircase to the entrance-hall, where Stelfax soon afterwards
  joined him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5-5"
     name="ch5-5">CHAPTER V<br>
  How The Captain Of The Ironsides Inspected<br>
  The Village Church, And Made Another Capture</a></h2>

  <p class="first">GREAT was the consternation throughout the Grange when it
  became known that Clavering Maunsel and the two others were captured. All the
  serving-men flocked towards the entrance-hall to satisfy themselves of the
  truth of the report, and the sad spectacle they there beheld left them no
  doubt of its correctness.</p>

  <p>In the midst of a circle of troopers, carabines in hand, stood the three
  prisoners; unbound, but deprived of all means of resistance. Clavering looked
  much depressed, but the other two cast defiant glances at the guard.</p>

  <p>Near approach to the prisoners being interdicted, the passage leading to
  the kitchen and buttery, which opened upon the entrance-hall, was thronged
  with anxious spectators. Here old Martin Geere, Giles Moppett, Elias Crundy,
  and others, were stationed, conferring amongst themselves in whispers, and
  timorously looking on. They had been told by Besadaiah Eavestaff, who was
  posted at the upper end of the passage, that the prisoners would be taken to
  Lewes and lodged within the castle, but this was all they could learn.</p>

  <p>The information, however, was not strictly correct. The captain of the
  Ironsides had no intention of departing immediately, having made up his mind
  to pass the night at the Grange. The capture of the fugitives did not
  occasion any change in his plans. A brief consultation with Delves as to the
  best means of disposing of the prisoners until the morrow, led the sergeant
  to suggest the village church as a temporary stronghold&mdash;churches, in
  those days, being not unfrequently used for such purposes, and even as
  stables. Stelfax thought the suggestion good, but in order to satisfy himself
  of its feasibility, he went forth with Delves to inspect the sacred
  structure.</p>

  <p>The little church, it will be remembered, was but a short distance from
  the Grange, standing on the slope of the opposite down, and the two Ironsides
  soon reached it. On entering the porch, the door proved to be locked,
  whereupon Stelfax despatched the sergeant to the adjacent rectory for the
  key. While Delves departed on the errand, his leader strolled about the
  churchyard, examining the venerable structure from different points of
  view&mdash;not with any feelings of reverence for its sacred character, or
  admiration of its architectural beauty, but merely with a view to its
  adaptation to the purpose of a temporary stronghold. All was still around.
  The evening was serene and beautiful. The sun had sunk below the western
  hill; and the low square tower of the church was darkly defined against the
  glowing sky. The only object not in harmony with the peaceful scene was the
  formidable figure of the Ironside in his martial accoutrements.</p>

  <p>Stelfax&rsquo;s examination of the sacred fabric was quite satisfactory to
  him. The tower at the west end of the structure appeared to offer all he
  could desire in the way of security. It had no outlet to the churchyard; its
  windows were only three in number, placed at a considerable height from the
  ground, acutely pointed, and so narrow as to preclude all chance of escape by
  their means. If the interior of the tower corresponded with its outward
  appearance, it would suit the captain&rsquo;s requirements admirably.</p>

  <p>Proceeding to the parsonage-house, Delves opened the door without
  troubling himself to knock at it, sought out Micklegift, and, on finding him,
  authoritatively demanded the key of the church. The Independent minister
  energetically refused to deliver it up, and hastily rising, strove to snatch
  it from a nail in the wall, against which it hung. But the sergeant was too
  quick for him, and possessing himself of the prize, departed with it.</p>

  <p>Delves then joined his leader, while Micklegift, sorely annoyed at the
  occurrence, flew to his garden, which was only divided from the churchyard by
  a wall, and soon managed to obtain a position whence, without betraying
  himself, he could, command their proceedings, and overhear their
  discourse&mdash;so long, at least, as they remained outside the church. From
  the few words which passed between them previous to their entering the sacred
  edifice, he ascertained their design, and resolved to thwart it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, this irreverend and unscrupulous soldier of the
  Republic,&rdquo; thus ran his meditations, &ldquo;whose doings put to shame
  and tarnish the actions of his mighty general, Cromwell&mdash;this base
  officer having had the good fortune to capture the young fugitive malignant
  and his followers, purposes to bestow his prisoners for the night in my
  church, as in a stronghold or place of duresse. It is well! Not for any love
  that I bear Clavering Maunsel&mdash;for, regarding him as a rival, I cannot
  but hold him in aversion; not for any desire I have to serve the Royalist
  cause, for I am strongly and conscientiously opposed to it; but because of
  the hatred I bear to this detested Stelfax, and because of the dishonourable
  treatment he hath shown me, will I confound his devices, and deliver these
  captives from their hands. Yea, I will set my wits to work to accomplish
  their liberation, and I doubt not of success.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While the Independent minister was forming this vindictive resolve,
  Stelfax and his companion had gained an entrance to the church, and the
  Roundhead leader found, on inspecting the interior of the tower, that the
  opinion he had formed of its security and fitness were fully justified.
  &ldquo;If the place had been built for us,&rdquo; he remarked to Sergeant
  Delves, as they stepped into the chamber, &ldquo;It could not have been
  better contrived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The interior of the church tower formed a small square chamber, very lofty
  in proportion to its height:&mdash;the room, as we have heretofore stated,
  being used, at the present day, as a vestiary. Above was a little belfry,
  which could only be entered by a trap-door in the ceiling; but, as a
  tolerably long ladder was required to reach this trap-door, and no ladder was
  at hand, little danger was to be apprehended in that direction. The walls
  were of solid masonry, coated with plaster and whitewashed. Internally, the
  tower was some feet lower than the ground outside it, so that the windows
  were elevated in like proportion from the floor, and far out of the reach of
  the tallest man. We have already shown that they were too narrow to allow
  even a slightly-built person to pass through them. The chamber was entirely
  empty. The sole entrance to the tower was from the body of the church; the
  door being of stout oak, studded with flat- headed nails, and fitted into a
  pointed arch.</p>

  <p>Having completed their survey, Stelfax and the sergeant quitted the sacred
  fabric, locking the door as they went forth, and taking the key with them. As
  they passed through the churchyard, the Ironside leader made some
  observations upon the strength and security of the tower, and its
  suitableness for their present purpose, wholly unconscious that his
  observations reached the ears of Micklegift.</p>

  <p>Issuing from the little gate of the churchyard, the Ironsides were about
  to descend the green slope leading to the valley, when, to their surprise,
  they perceived a couple of horsemen dash suddenly down the steepest part of
  the escarpment on their left&mdash;the same hillside, in fact, only at a more
  abrupt declivity, on which the church itself was built. The horsemen were not
  more than a hundred yards off on first coming into sight, but while they
  themselves were fully visible to the Ironsides, the latter were screened from
  view by an intervening hedge, and a cluster of overhanging trees. Both
  horsemen were remarkably well mounted, and appeared to be making for the
  Grange. Stelfax and his companion stood still to watch their course.
  Something there was in the appearance of the horsemen that led both
  lookers-on to the conclusion that they were fugitive Cavaliers; and the
  curiosity of the Ironsides was greatly excited to learn who they were, and
  what could have brought them to the Grange, at a moment of such peril to
  themselves. Meanwhile, the supposed Royalists, totally unconscious of danger,
  galloped on, and were now almost at the gates of the mansion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If yon madmen be malignants, as I take them to be,&rdquo; cried
  Stelfax, with a laugh, &ldquo;they will fall headlong into the lion&rsquo;s
  den. To the house, sergeant, and let us assist in their capture!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, he drew his sword, and closely attended by Delves, who likewise
  plucked forth his blade, he ran down the slope, and made for the house-gates
  with all possible despatch.</p>

  <p>Another instant confirmed the suspicions which both Iron-sides had
  entertained, that the horsemen were Royalists. Scarcely had the twain entered
  the gates, through which they rode with insensate haste and utter
  recklessness of consequences, than they were challenged by the sentinels
  posted within the court. At once comprehending the peril in which their
  inadvertence had placed them, the reckless horsemen endeavoured to back out.
  Seeing this, one of the troopers rushed towards the gates, in order to close
  them, and cut off their retreat, while the other, presenting his carabine,
  threatened to fire if they moved. Nothing daunted, however, the Cavalier
  against whom the musket was levelled, and who was but a short distance from
  the sentinel, having managed to draw his sword, struck the weapon from the
  man&rsquo;s grasp. The carabine went off as it fell, but did no mischief.</p>

  <p>All this was the work of a minute, and so rapidly had the horsemen turned,
  that the one next the gates passed through them before the trooper could
  swing round the heavy iron frames to prevent his exit; while even the hinder
  Cavalier would have made good his retreat, if Stelfax and the sergeant had
  not come up at the juncture. Springing at the foremost horseman, Delves made
  an effort to arrest him, but the Cavalier, plunging spurs into his steed,
  dashed against him with such force as to hurl him to the ground; in which
  position the sergeant discharged his pistol at the fugitive, but without
  effect.</p>

  <p>Less lucky than his companion, who thus got off uninjured, the second
  Cavalier had to encounter Stelfax, who rushed up to him without hesitation,
  and, seizing his bridle, bade him surrender. The Cavalier replied by a
  desperate cut at the Ironside leader&rsquo;s head, which might have cleared
  the way for him if it had taken effect; but Stelfax warded off the blow, and,
  catching hold of his antagonist, dragged him by sheer force of arm from his
  horse. The contest, though taking some time to narrate, had been, in reality,
  so brief, that no one else could take part in it; though several troopers
  rushed towards the scene of strife.</p>

  <p>The luckless Cavalier who had thus been captured by the stalwart Ironside
  leader, was tall and well proportioned. His attire was sad-coloured, and of
  Puritan plainness, and his locks cropped close to his head. Nevertheless, his
  looks and deportment did not agree with these symbols of Puritanism. He was a
  man of middle age, but of undiminished energies, as his hardy opponent had
  discovered.</p>

  <p>While holding the discomfited Cavalier in his iron grasp, Stelfax scanned
  his features for a short space; and then shouted to Delves, who by this time
  had regained his legs, demanding, &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;whom dost thou hold
  this malignant to be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not Charles Stuart,&rdquo; the sergeant replied, surveying
  the captive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charles Stuart!&mdash;tush! This man of middle age. Look again, and
  carefully. Hast thou beheld that face before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yea, verily have I, and at Worcester,&rdquo; the sergeant answered.
  &ldquo;It is the face of one who, at that conflict, commanded the left wing
  of the army of Abijam, the son of Rehoboam. It is the Lord Wilmot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; Stelfax exclaimed. &ldquo;It is the Lord
  Wilmot. Of a truth, this is an important capture&mdash;next to that of the
  Young Man himself, the most important that could have been effected, and the
  one that will give the greatest satisfaction to the Lord General. But though
  we have taken a commander of a division, the leader of the whole army may
  have escaped us. Peradventure, it was Abijam himself who hath just fled.
  Didst thou note the features and person of the man whom thou didst vainly
  essay to capture?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I looked upon him as he charged me,&rdquo; Delves replied;
  &ldquo;and methought he was younger, and more active than this man, and of a
  swarthy complexion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis he!&mdash;&lsquo;tis Charles Stuart in person! I am well
  assured of it,&rdquo; Stelfax cried out in great excitement. &ldquo;Sound
  boot and saddle! I will pursue instantly. I will scour the country round but
  I will have him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are deceived, sir,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot, who had not
  hitherto uttered a syllable. &ldquo;It is not the king who hath just ridden
  off. His Majesty is safe across the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not take your word on that point, my lord,&rdquo; the
  Ironside leader rejoined. &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; he vociferated at the top of
  his stentorian voice. &ldquo;My horse without a moment&rsquo;s
  delay&mdash;&lsquo;tis well I kept him ready for instant service&mdash;three
  men to go with me. The rest shall remain here to guard the prisoners till my
  return. The fugitive is yet in sight; but I shall lose him if ye
  delay&mdash;quick, knaves, quick! Ha! he has gained the top of the
  hill&mdash;he disappears&mdash;he will escape me if ye loiter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; Lord Wilmot exclaimed, with irrepressible
  emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give praises to Heaven if I fail to take your young monarch, my
  lord, but not before. Here comes my horse,&rdquo; cried Stelfax, vaulting
  into the saddle. &ldquo;Lead our noble captive into the house, sergeant. Let
  his person be searched carefully, and then put him with the other prisoners.
  If I return not speedily, remove them all to the church tower, and keep
  strict watch over them. And hark ye, sergeant, if rescue be attempted, spare
  not, but smite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fear nothing, captain,&rdquo; Delves replied. &ldquo;I will make a
  terrible example of all such as oppose our authority.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Three mounted troopers having by this time joined their leader, the little
  party struck spurs into their horses, and galloped along the valley, and then
  up the steep escarpment on the left, pursuing the course taken by the
  fugitive; while Lord Wilmot was led into he house by Delves and the other
  Ironsides.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-1"
     name="ch6-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  Showing How Ninian Escaped;<br>
  And How The Other Prisoners Were<br>
  Taken To The Church Tower</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A CONFLICT, such as we described in the last chapter,
  between Cavalier and Roundhead, where the odds were so greatly against the
  former, could not fail to excite vividly the feelings of staunch partisans of
  the royal cause like Clavering and John Habergeon. But the person among the
  prisoners who profited by the confusion incident to the capture of Lord
  Wilmot and the flight of his companion was Ninian Saxby. While the attention
  of the guard was attracted to what was going on outside, the young falconer
  slipped suddenly between two of the soldiers, and, almost at a bound, reached
  the entrance to the passage leading to the buttery.</p>

  <p>This passage was thronged with various members of the household, and
  amongst them was Ninian&rsquo;s own father, who beheld with the utmost
  anxiety the daring attempt of his son. At the head of the passage Besadaiah
  Eavestaff was posted, carabine in hand. But he failed to impede the young
  falconer&rsquo;s flight. Before he could level his gun, his arms were seized
  by those behind him, and Ninian was enabled to pass by. No sooner was he gone
  than the passage was blocked up, and it could not be cleared till pursuit was
  useless. Fortunately for Ninian, the patrol at the rear of the mansion had
  just been removed, so there was no further hindrance to his retreat.</p>

  <p>On being informed of the young falconer&rsquo;s escape, which he learnt as
  he entered the hall with Lord Wilmot and the guard, Sergeant Delves was
  greatly enraged, and sharply reprimanding the troopers, especially Besadaiah
  Eavestaff, for neglect of duty, threatened to make a severe example of such
  of the household as had aided Ninian&rsquo;s flight. The principal offender,
  and the person who had seized Besadaiah from behind, turned out, upon
  inquiry, to be the fugitive&rsquo;s own father; but he, too, had disappeared.
  Delves was therefore obliged to content himself with clearing the passage
  from all intruders, which he did in a very summary manner. No great pains
  were taken to recapture Ninian. Though vexed at the occurrence, as knowing it
  would irritate Stelfax when it came to his knowledge, the sergeant did not
  like to diminish the guard by sending men to scour the country in quest of an
  escaped prisoner of little consequence, thereby endangering the security of
  his more important captives, Lord Wilmot and Clavering Maunsel.</p>

  <p>Stelfax&rsquo;s orders in regard to Lord Wilmot were strictly obeyed. The
  Royalist nobleman was searched; but no letters or papers referring to the
  fugitive monarch, or calculated to give the slightest clue to his retreat,
  were discovered. Lord Wilmot smiled contemptuously as Delves
  scrutinized&rsquo; the tablets and pocket-book handed to him by the
  searchers. The memoranda contained in these little books were written in a
  cypher perfectly unintelligible to the sergeant; but though he could make
  nothing of the mysterious characters, Delves thought his leader might be able
  to unravel them, and he therefore put the books carefully into his pouch.
  Only a few pieces of gold were found in Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s purse; so that he
  must have disposed of the large sum of money which he had obtained that
  morning from Zachary Trangmar. But of this the sergeant knew nothing, and
  consequently made no inquiries on the subject.</p>

  <p>Just as the search was completed, Colonel Maunsel was seen tottering down
  the principal staircase, which communicated with the entrance-hall. He was
  supported by old Martin Geere, and appeared greatly debilitated. But he was
  not allowed to descend to the hall. At a sign from Delves, two troopers
  planted themselves at the foot of the staircase, crossing their carabines, as
  an intimation to the old Cavalier that he could not pass. Thereupon, he
  stopped midway in the staircase, and gazed at the group below.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who have you there?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is not&mdash;it
  cannot be the king! Some one cried out just now that his Majesty was taken,
  but I will not believe the evil tidings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fear nothing, colonel,&rdquo; cried Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;Our
  gracious monarch will never be captured by these men. He is safe from their
  pursuit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; the old Cavalier fervently ejaculated.
  &ldquo;I cannot discern the features of him who speaks to me, but the voice
  is the voice of a friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Inveterate malignant as thou art, there is no reason why thou
  shouldst remain in ignorance of the rank and title of the prisoner we have
  made,&rdquo; Delves rejoined, &ldquo;and I will therefore declare them unto
  thee. Not many minutes since, two men rode up to thy gates with such blind
  precipitation, that they perceived not, till too late, that the house was in
  the possession of the soldiers of the Commonwealth. One of these insensate
  persons was speedily captured, and proved to be the Lord Wilmot, the chosen
  friend of thy sovereign. The other effected a retreat, but our captain hath
  started in pursuit of him, and will not relinquish the chase till the prey be
  secured. Notwithstanding his lordship&rsquo;s denial, I leave thee to
  conjecture who was likely to have been his companion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s satisfaction, and not for thine,
  fellow,&rdquo; cried Lord Wilmot, &ldquo;I repeat that it is not as thou
  wouldst insinuate. His Majesty is far away from this place. In regard to my
  own inopportune visit to Ovingdean Grange, I can, at the proper season,
  render such explanation as will absolve Colonel Maunsel from any suspicion of
  complicity with me or my companion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I pray your lordship not to bestow a thought upon me,&rdquo; the
  old Cavalier cried. &ldquo;Let these miscreants glut themselves with my blood
  if they will. They have robbed me of my darling boy, and I care not what else
  they take.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be comforted, my father,&rdquo; said Clavering; &ldquo;my troubles
  will soon be over. Bethink thee of the sacred cause for which I lay down my
  life. That reflection will support me in my latest hour. Let it support thee
  now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well said, young sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Wilmot, extending his
  hand to him, which Clavering warmly grasped. &ldquo;These are sentiments to
  deprive the scaffold of all terror. But trust me,&rdquo; he added, in a
  cheerful tone, &ldquo;you will disappoint your bloodthirsty captors. You are
  reserved for better days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap your lordship also calculates upon escaping the punishment
  due to your treasonable offences against the Commonwealth?&rdquo; jeered
  Delves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I calculate upon enjoying the fruits of my fidelity to a gracious
  lord and master,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot replied, &ldquo;as well as of my
  unceasing efforts to free his kingdom from the bloodthirsty and rebellious
  fanatics by whom it is overrun. Look well to thy charge, sirrah, for, by my
  faith, thou shalt have some trouble to hold me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As these bold words were uttered, his lordship&rsquo;s eye rested upon
  John Habergeon, and he read in the old trooper&rsquo;s looks that any attempt
  he might make for his own liberation would be effectively seconded by
  him.</p>

  <p>Upon one person, for whose benefit the captive nobleman&rsquo;s
  observations were chiefly uttered, they produced a cheering effect. Hope was
  suddenly reawakened in Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s breast, and he roused himself
  from the state of almost atony into which he had sunk. Things did not look
  now quite so desperate as they had done. He began to conceive projects for
  his son&rsquo;s deliverance, and even debated with himself the possibility of
  stirring up his house hold to an attack upon the Ironsides.</p>

  <p>But Delves did not allow him much time for reflection. Though regarding
  Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s speech as mere bravado&mdash;Cavalier&rsquo;s
  rodomontade, he styled it&mdash;the sergeant thought that the prisoners had
  given their tongues licence enough. A stop must be put to the further
  expression of their sentiments. Sternly ordering them to keep silence, he
  signified in a peremptory tone to Colonel Maunsel that he must retire to his
  own chamber. The command roused the old Cavalier&rsquo;s ire, and he seemed
  by no means inclined to obey it; but his son besought him by his looks to
  yield compliance, and, after a little hesitation, he remounted the staircase
  much more firmly than he had come down it, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Three wearisome hours passed by, and Stelfax had not returned. During the
  whole of this time the prisoners were detained in the entrance-hall. Not a
  word was exchanged between Lord Wilmot and Clavering that did not reach the
  ears of Delves, who stood close beside them. The sergeant, however, began to
  find this lengthened attendance irksome, and his men, moreover, looked as if
  a little change would be agreeable.</p>

  <p>Preparations were, therefore, made for the removal of the prisoners to the
  church. Delves had sixteen men under his command, three of the troopers, as
  already intimated, having gone with Stelfax in pursuit of the fugitive
  Cavalier. Half of the force at his disposal the sergeant decided upon taking
  with him to the church, deeming that number ample guard for the prisoners:
  the other half should stay at the Grange to keep watch over the malignant
  colonel and his household. But before carrying his plan into execution, he
  repaired to the buttery, and causing a couple of baskets to be filled with
  provisions and wine, despatched Moppett and Crundy&mdash;under a
  guard&mdash;with these stores to the church; and, on their return, he took
  out his prisoners, and placing himself at the head of the escort, moved
  towards the sacred edifice.</p>

  <p>Torches to light the troop were carried by old Ticehurst, the gardener,
  and Nut Springett, who had been pressed into the service; and the flare of
  the flambeaux was reflected upon the steel caps, corslets, and carabines of
  the Ironsides. In the midst of the guard, by whom they were closely
  surrounded, marched the prisoners. The torchlight flashed upon gate and wall,
  upon overhanging tree and thick hedge-row as the little party
  advanced&mdash;Delves keeping a wary look-out lest any attack should be
  attempted.</p>

  <p>Though all the Roundhead soldiers were religious fanatics, not one of them
  had the slightest scruple in turning the sacred pile they were approaching
  into a strong-room for their prisoners, and a barrack for themselves. No
  feeling of irreverence crossed them as the church-door was unlocked, and the
  sergeant marched into the little nave with as much unconcern as if he had
  been entering a stable. Old Ticehurst and Springett were dismissed at the
  church-door, their services being no longer required; but the torches were
  brought into the building, and set up in such a position that their flame
  illuminated the whole of the interior. Very strange the place looked by this
  lurid light&mdash;so much like a sepulchre as a church.</p>

  <p>The sergeant&rsquo;s first business was to secure his prisoners. Finding
  all as he had left it, he put them inside the tower, informing them with a
  grin that they saw their place of lodging for the night. Lord Wilmot glanced
  at the bare walls and the cold flagged floor, and shuddered involuntarily,
  but made no remonstrance, and Clavering was equally silent. But John
  Habergeon did not display any such self-restraint, but loudly remonstrated
  with the sergeant, and in the end succeeded in obtaining from him an oaken
  bench, a flask of wine, a loaf of bread with some cold viands, and a small
  lighted lamp. The strong oak door of the tower was left ajar, in order that
  the movements of the prisoners might be observed; and close to this door a
  trooper&mdash;it was Helpless Henly&mdash;was posted.</p>

  <p>The prisoners disposed of, the gaolers prepared to enjoy themselves. The
  church-door was locked inside to prevent all chance of sudden intrusion;
  benches were drawn together, on one of which the contents of the baskets were
  placed; and Delves, who declared he was sore hungered, set his comrades the
  example by making a vigorous attack upon a goose-pie, which, in addition to
  being very savoury, was strongly provocative of thirst, compelling the
  sergeant to make frequent application to the wine-flask.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it would almost seem as if those who stocked the baskets had
  sought out the most powerful incentives to drinking. Besides the goose-pie
  before mentioned, there was the best part of a salted chine of beef, together
  with three or four powdered neats&rsquo; tongues. These relishing viands soon
  produced the intended effect upon those who partook of them, and flask after
  flask was quickly emptied.</p>

  <p>But the thirst of the Ironsides seemed to increase instead of diminishing,
  and Tola Fell asked leave of the sergeant, to procure a fresh supply of wine
  from the Grange. Delves, however, who could not fail to perceive that a
  certain impression had been already produced by the copious draughts which
  his comrades had swallowed, peremptorily refused&mdash;a decision which
  naturally occasioned some grumbling&mdash;but good humour was at once
  restored by the accidental discovery by Besadaiah Eavestaff of a couple of
  large stone bottles of strong waters, snugly packed at the bottom of a
  basket, which had been hitherto unaccountably overlooked. Loud shouts were
  raised by the troopers as these bottles were brought forth. In vain Delves,
  who began to be seriously apprehensive of the consequences, enjoined the men
  to abstain from further intemperance. His authority was set at nought. The
  bottles were passed from hand to hand, and as one of them neared the
  sergeant, he found the odour so irresistible that he could not pass the
  vessel without taking toll of its contents. The strong waters quickly
  unloosed the tongues of the troopers; they began to laugh and talk loudly, to
  sing and shout, comporting themselves as boisterously as wassailers at a
  tavern. They gave themselves up to enjoyment, and in order to set themselves
  completely at ease, unbuckled their belts, and took off their bandoleers,
  corslets, and steel caps, and in the end disembarrassed themselves of their
  scarlet jerkins. Stretching themselves luxuriously upon the benches, they
  lighted their pipes, and soon filled the church with the fumes of tobacco.
  After a while, their potations began to tell. Half of them dropped asleep,
  and Helpless Henly, who had drunk rather more than his comrades, was obliged
  to lean against the wall for support, looking the picture of inebriety.
  Delves was greatly enraged at the insubordination of his men. Finding it vain
  to rouse Helpless Henly to a sense of duty, he pushed him aside, and took his
  place. The drunken fellow reeled forward, and, stumbling over a bench, lay
  stretched upon the flags, whence he was unable to rise. At the noise caused
  by the fall of the huge Ironside, both Lord Wilmot and Clavering, who had
  been seated on the bench, started to their feet, and the former advanced to
  the door to see what was the matter, but, being instantly noticed by Delves,
  he was ordered back. But the glance had been enough to disclose to his
  lordship the inebriate condition of the troopers, and he whispered to his
  companions that he thought an attempt to escape would soon be practicable.
  The only person, as it seemed to him, capable of offering effectual
  resistance was Delves. If he were overcome, the rest might be easily
  mastered. Having heard what Lord Wilmot said, John Habergeon crept stealthily
  to the door, and, after reconnoitring the scene before him for a short time,
  told his companions to hold themselves in readiness for a sudden
  outburst.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The grand point,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to prevent, if possible,
  these rascals from using their fire-arms, or the alarm will be given to their
  comrades at the Grange. When the attack is made, let me go out first, and I
  will engage to disarm the sergeant. With the rest we must take our
  chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-2"
     name="ch6-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  The Chase Of The Cavalier</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LEAVING the desecrated church for a while, we will now
  follow Stelfax and his men in their chase after the fugitive Cavalier.</p>

  <p>On gaining the brow of the hill which the flying horseman had crossed, the
  Roundhead leader looked around in vain for the object of his quest, and came
  to a momentary halt. The position he and his men had attained was a most
  commanding one, being, in fact, the south-eastern boundary of the existing
  race- course. To those unfamiliar with the locality, it may be proper to
  mention that the Brighton race-course&mdash;one of the most beautifully
  situated in England&mdash;forms a wide semicircular sweep over the gently
  undulating ridges of a very extensive down. The large arc described by this
  noble hill embraces part of Kemp Town, and constitutes a worthy background to
  Brighton itself. At present the race- hill retains much of its original
  character; but encroachments are being constantly made upon the springy turf
  so dear to the pedestrian and the horseman. At the time, however, of our
  story the eminence was wholly uncultivated and unenclosed. Magnificent was
  the view which it offered to Stelfax and his followers. The sea was dyed with
  the gorgeous hues of the sun, which had just sank beneath the waves. Towards
  the west the whole line of coast was visible, from the little fishing town of
  Brightelmstone, with its small ruinous castle or block-house standing close
  to the shore; Shoreham, with its harbour, in which a few vessels were moored;
  and, farther on, Worthing, and the narrow neck of land beyond it jutting out
  far into the sea. In this direction, also, the Isle of Wight could now be
  distinctly seen, rising proudly out of the glowing waters. Exactly opposite
  the Roundhead leader&mdash;though to reach it he would have had to cross a
  lower intermediate hill&mdash;stood one of those ancient encampments found on
  many commanding points of the downs, and denominated the White Hawk. Hard by
  this antique camp stood a fire-beacon. Other camp-crowned hills were also
  visible from the spot where Stelfax stood&mdash;namely, Ditchling, which,
  moreover, possessed a beacon; Hollingsbury, Wolstonbury, and Chanctonbury,
  the latter constituting a landmark from its clump of fir- trees.</p>

  <p>The view Stelfax beheld, though sufficiently striking, differed materially
  from that which would now be offered to a spectator stationed on the same
  spot. No modern race-stand towered before the stern soldier of the
  Commonwealth as he cast his eye on the opposite hill&mdash;no lines of white
  railings marked out the course reserved for struggling steeds&mdash;no mighty
  structures reared on the southern slopes of the declivity met his
  ken&mdash;no stately terraces built on the high cliffs overlooking the sea
  awakened his admiration, or proclaimed the vicinity of a large and well-built
  town. Nothing of this kind did the Roundhead behold. In the valley
  immediately beneath him were a barn and sheepfold. At the point called the
  black Rock, near the coast, a small farm-house, with two or three cottages
  adjoining it, could be distinguished. These were the only habitations in
  sight. An air of solitude pervaded the hill. A single figure, darkly defined
  against the still radiant western sky, and dilated to gigantic proportions,
  could be perceived on the verge of the Roman encampment near the fire-beacon.
  None else was in sight, save an old grey-coated shepherd, who, crook in hand,
  and attended by his dog, was driving a flock of loudly-bleating sheep down
  the steep escarpment towards the fold in the valley.</p>

  <p>A few seconds sufficed to place all we have taken so long to describe
  before the quick-sighted Ironside leader. He looked right and left, but could
  discern no trace of the fugitive, and yet he ought to be in view. The dark
  figure near the White Hawk camp could not possibly be him. The spot was too
  far off to have been reached. But Stelfax did not pause long in reflection.
  Dashing down the hill-side towards the shepherd, he fiercely demanded whether
  he had seen a horseman pass by, and in which direction he had ridden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I seed him,&rdquo; the old shepherd replied; &ldquo;he were
  going at a desperate pace for sure, and well-nigh trampled down some of my
  sheep as he rode through the flock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But which way did he take?&rdquo; Stelfax furiously demanded.
  &ldquo;And mark me, thou hoary knave! I read deceit in thine eye. Attempt to
  mislead me, and I will return and shoot thee down with as little scruple as I
  would the cur at thy heels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no thought to deceive you, honoured captain,&rdquo; the old
  man replied, in a voice quavering with terror. &ldquo;The person you be
  searching after rode off by yon patch of gorse.&rdquo; Pointing, as he spoke,
  with his crook towards an acclivity on the north-west.</p>

  <p>Stelfax tarried not a moment longer, but galloped off with his men in the
  direction indicated by the shepherd. The brow of the hill was covered so
  thickly with furze that it was impossible to pursue a straightforward course
  over it, and the Ironsides had to deviate a little to the left in order to
  avoid the impediment. They soon, however, crossed the summit, and then fresh
  valleys opened on either side. New downs, too, rose before them, varying
  little in aspect or character from those which they had just traversed.
  Though the summits still glowed with the reflected radiance of the sky, the
  coombs looked dull and sombre; but there was no positive obscurity, and as
  Stelfax plunged his gaze into the hollows, he failed in discovering the
  object of his quest. On either hand the valleys were wide and extensive, and
  the sides of the hills bare, and destitute of covert sufficient to screen the
  fugitive from observation. The valley on the left, which ran in a northerly
  direction&mdash;the course apparently taken by the fugitive&mdash;was so
  broad and open, that, had the flying horseman gone that way, he must have
  been at once distinguished. But neither on the right or on the left could he
  be seen. If he had ascended the opposite downs, he must necessarily be in
  view. But he was not there. These considerations led Stelfax to the
  conclusion that he must have found some place of concealment, and his
  suspicions were instantly directed to a small holt or thicket growing near
  the foot of the opposite hill, which would offer convenient shelter.
  Satisfied with the correctness of his supposition, the Roundhead leader at
  once give directions to his men to separate, and approach the wood in such
  manner as would enable them most completely to invest it. The injunctions
  were promptly obeyed, Stelfax himself moving off a little to the left, and
  then mounting the hill-side, so as to bring himself close to the top of the
  holt which straggled slantingly up the acclivity. These precautionary
  measures taken, entrance was simultaneously made into the thicket at four
  different points. The timber of which the holt was composed consisted almost
  entirely of ash, hazel, and oaks. None of the trees had attained any great
  size, and being planted closely together&mdash;much too closely to allow free
  growth&mdash;while brambles and thorns likewise abounded in the thicket, it
  was in places almost impervious. The crashing of branches proclaimed the
  advance of the Ironsides, and more than one pheasant was disturbed by them.
  But as yet the fugitive had not been detected. All at once Stelfax, who had
  pushed on more expeditiously than his men, descried the horseman hidden in
  the depths of the grove. Unable to repress a shout of exultation at the
  sight, he called to the Cavalier to surrender, but the latter replied by
  firing a pistol at him: the thickly intervening trees rendering it impossible
  that aim could be taken, the ball lodged in the trunk of an adjoining oak.
  The Cavalier then turned and endeavoured to make good his retreat, while
  Stelfax pressed vigorously after him, shouting to his men to intercept him.
  But it soon appeared that the fugitive was quite as active as his pursuers,
  and understood rather better than they did how to make his way through a
  tangled thicket. He dexterously slipped through the trees, while the fiery
  haste and impetuosity of Stelfax only tended to his own disadvantage. The
  Roundhead leader made one or two ineffectual dashes at the Cavalier, but the
  other easily avoided him, and, guided by the noise made by the advancing
  troopers, he likewise managed to keep out of their way. This adroit mode of
  proceeding soon increased the distance between Stelfax and himself, and
  enabled him to obtain a considerable start ere the Roundhead leader and his
  men could extricate themselves from the holt and give chase.</p>

  <p>Both pursued and pursuers now went along at a headlong pace. For some
  little time the Cavalier kept in the valley, and crossed the rough and
  ill-kept road leading to Lewes. At that time there was no direct road from
  the metropolis to Brightelmstone, and only the deep-rutted cart-road just
  mentioned between the latter place and Lewes. The whole district being
  perfectly open and unenclosed&mdash;not a hedge or fence existing, save in
  the neighbourhood of some sequestered homestead&mdash;there was nothing to
  check the progress either of the fugitive or those on his track.</p>

  <p>On&mdash;on they went&mdash;now traversing a winding valley, now mounting
  a hill&mdash;anon descending to another dell&mdash;crossing it, and making a
  new ascent. All this without in the slightest degree relaxing speed. The
  Cavalier seemed in no wise troubled about his pursuers, feeling confident,
  apparently, that he should leave them behind in the end. Hitherto not a
  single individual had been encountered. The downs seemed wholly deserted.</p>

  <p>The Cavalier had now gained the summit of the hill on which the ancient
  encampment called Hollingsbury Castle may be traced, and as his pursuers were
  not more than half way up the hill, he drew in the rein near the old
  earthwork, to breathe his panting steed for a moment. Seeing him pause thus,
  Stelfax and his men hurried on; but ere they could get within pistol-shot, he
  speeded off down the smooth turf of the declivity, as if making for the
  pretty little village of Preston, the church of which could be discerned in
  the valley, about half a mile off, embosomed in trees. But the fugitive, it
  soon became manifest, had no intention of entering the village. He soon
  struck off on the right, and keeping on the slopes of the hill until he had
  passed Patcham and its hanging wood, crossed the valley now traversed by the
  railway, and ascended the opposite hill. Probably, he had conjectured that
  the Ironsides, finding their efforts to come up with him fruitless, would
  desist from further pursuit&mdash;but in this supposition he was deceived.
  Stelfax was not the man to be baffled. As long as their horses could carry
  them, he and his troopers would follow&mdash;and though their steeds were not
  so swift as that of the Cavalier, they were stronger, and capable of greater
  endurance. So not many minutes elapsed ere they were on the top of the down
  and galloping after him.</p>

  <p>With the evident intention of disembarrassing himself of them, the
  fugitive now led them into all sorts of difficult places, and practised every
  possible man&oelig;uvre to shake them off. In vain. They still held on; while
  the stratagems essayed by the Cavalier had more than once well-nigh led to
  his capture.</p>

  <p>It was after a mischance of this kind, in which an attempt to double had
  been dexterously checked by Stelfax, that he suddenly changed his plan, and
  once more set off straight-a-head with great swiftness.</p>

  <p>They were now upon a chain of downs that terminates on the north in the
  lofty and steep escarpment closely adjoining the extraordinary trench
  popularly known as the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke. It was towards the steepest part
  of this dangerous declivity that the Cavalier now rode. Perfectly acquainted
  with the country, as the result proved, he knew whither he was going, and was
  prepared for the hazardous feat he had to perform. Not so his pursuers. This
  precipitous escarpment, which stands like a great natural bulwark at the
  south of the broad Weald of Sussex&mdash;the whole of that immense and
  beautiful tract being discernible at one glance from it&mdash;slopes suddenly
  and abruptly down, without the slightest interruption to the valley, the
  perilous nature of the descent being materially increased by the slippery
  condition of the turf, which offers, at dry seasons especially, a very
  insecure footing. A single false step would send the luckless wight who made
  it sliding to the foot of the escarpment in double- quick time. On the brow
  of this lofty hill are the remains of an encampment, with a wide ditch and a
  rampart surrounding it of nearly a mile in circumference. Adjacent to this
  camp, and dividing it from the lower range of downs, is the Dyke.</p>

  <p>Skirting the brink of this remarkable chasm, the Cavalier rode on, and
  passing through a breach in the outworks of the camp, made for that portion
  of the rampart which overlooks the steepest part of the declivity. He paused
  not for a moment, but ere reaching the verge of the rampart, cast a glance of
  defiance at his pursuers. Stelfax, at that instant, was passing through the
  breach on the south side of the camp. Unaware of the perilous nature of the
  feat about to be attempted, he saw the Cavalier spring from the edge of the
  rampart, and plunge down the descent beyond it. Intending to follow him, the
  Roundhead officer rode on, but as he neared the brink of the declivity, and
  its precipitous and dangerous character became fully revealed to him, he
  recoiled, and drew in the rein with such force that he almost pulled back his
  steed upon his haunches. Just in time! In another instant he would have
  leaped the rampart, and must have rolled from top to bottom of the sharp
  descent. Cautiously approaching the edge of the declivity, to his infinite
  astonishment and vexation he beheld the bold horseman rapidly descending the
  steep escarpment, apparently with perfect ease and security. The rider seemed
  to trust himself entirely to his horse, not attempting to direct him, but
  leaving him to take his own way. All he did was to lean back as much as he
  could in the saddle to avoid sliding out of it on to the horse&rsquo;s
  shoulder. In this way he had accomplished nearly half the descent.</p>

  <p>The sight stung Stelfax to the quick. His prey he now felt would escape
  him. If the fugitive should reach the bottom in safety, his escape was
  inevitable. Long before the valley could be gained by any secure descent, he
  would be far out of harm&rsquo;s way, and Stelfax, fearless and venturesome
  as he was, did not like to essay this perilous descent, not deeming his horse
  sufficiently sure- footed to accomplish it. There was but one way of
  arresting the fugitive. Stelfax took a pistol from his holster, and fired.
  His mark had not been the Cavalier, but his steed. The ball lodged in the
  gallant animal&rsquo;s brain. Instantly quitting the almost sliding posture
  he had assumed, he sprang with a slight bound in the air, and then dropped.
  The Cavalier had managed to disengage himself from the saddle, but fell in
  the attempt, and could not recover his footing. He and his slaughtered steed
  rolled together to the bottom of the declivity, where both lay
  motionless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have Abijam now&mdash;dead or alive,&rdquo; cried Stelfax to his
  men, who by this time had come up. &ldquo;Mattathias and Enoch go ye down to
  the valley by yon safe though circuitous route on the left, while Nathan
  Guestling and I will find our way down on the right. Lose no
  time&mdash;though there is little fear that our prey will escape us now. He
  hath not stirred since he fell, and I fear me is killed outright.&rdquo;</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch-3"
     name="ch-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  Of The Guests At The Poynings&rsquo; Arms</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON reaching the valley, Stelfax, closely followed by Nathan
  Guestling, rode towards the spot where the luckless Cavalier was lying.
  Hitherto, he had not moved; but when the Roundheads drew near, he began to
  exhibit some symptoms of animation, and made an effort to regain his feet.
  The exertion, however, was too much for him, and he sank back with a
  groan.</p>

  <p>Flinging himself from his horse, and giving the bridle to Guestling,
  Stelfax bent over the prostrate Cavalier, and carefully studied his features.
  The result of this examination was by no means satisfactory. The person under
  his scrutiny was some ten years older than Charles Stuart, though his slight
  figure and swarthy complexion, fine black eyes, and long dark locks, had
  given him a general resemblance to the youthful monarch. On closer
  inspection, however, the likeness vanished, and the stranger&rsquo;s
  lineaments were found to be different in many points from those of the king.
  Stelfax gave vent to his disappointment in a loud and angry exclamation, and
  called out to the two other troopers, who rode up at the moment, that it was
  not Abijam after all. Hearing what passed, the prostrate Cavalier raised
  himself upon his elbow, and cried, &ldquo;So you took me for the
  king&mdash;ha! No wonder you gave me so hot a chase. Learn to your confusion
  that his Majesty is safe from pursuit, and never likely to fall into
  rebellious hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So your friend, Lord Wilmot, affirmed, Sir,&rdquo; rejoined
  Stelfax; &ldquo;but I attached little credit to his assertion, and I attach
  no more to yours. You are my prisoner. Under what name and title do you
  surrender?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is my pleasure to guard my incognito as long as I can,&rdquo;
  the Cavalier replied. &ldquo;I must therefore decline to furnish you with my
  name. As to title, I have none.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are too modest, methinks, sir,&rdquo; Stelfax cried.
  &ldquo;Remain unknown, if you will, for the present. If you are not treated
  with the consideration due to your rank, you have only yourself to
  blame.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no rank whatever, I repeat,&rdquo; the Cavalier replied.
  &ldquo;I am but a simple gentleman&mdash;and a very poor gentleman into the
  bargain&mdash;thanks to the fines and confiscations of your State Council.
  Will one of your men lend a hand to lift me up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will do as much for you myself, sir,&rdquo; Stelfax replied,
  helping him to his feet. &ldquo;I hope you are not much hurt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No bones are broken, I think,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;but I
  am a good deal shaken. You gave me rather an awkward tumble down the
  hill&mdash;but I should not heed that if my horse had been spared,&rdquo;
  glancing, as the words were uttered, with great commiseration at the body of
  the poor animal lying stark beside him. &ldquo;He was a gallant steed! I
  shall never get such another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A brave horse, in sooth!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax. &ldquo;I felt
  sorry to despatch him&mdash;but I must have shot him or you. You may,
  however, console yourself for the loss by reflecting that you will never
  more, in all likelihood, require his services.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is but cold comfort,&rdquo; the other rejoined.
  &ldquo;However, we Cavaliers are not accustomed to despair, even at the foot
  of the scaffold. I hope to give you another run as good as the one you, have
  just enjoyed&mdash;with this difference only, that on the next occasion you
  may be left in the lurch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many a fox-chase has been less exciting, no doubt,&rdquo; said
  Stelfax, entering into the jest. &ldquo;But you must now submit to be
  searched by my men, sir. I regret that the measure cannot be dispensed
  with&mdash;but my orders are strict. All letters and papers must be sent to
  head-quarters&mdash;and perhaps I may learn at the same time whom I have the
  honour of addressing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Due precautions against a contingency like the present must have been
  taken by the Cavalier, since only a few unimportant articles were found upon
  him, and nothing whatever to afford a clue to his identity. Seeing the
  prisoner look very faint, and scarcely able to stand, though he uttered no
  complaint, Stelfax caused him to be lifted on to the croup of Nathan
  Guestling&rsquo;s horse, and secured by a broad belt passed round his own
  waist and that of the stalwart trooper in front. He then directed Mattathias
  and Enoch to ride one on either side of the captive, to prevent the
  possibility of escape, and set off for a hamlet, close at hand, where he made
  sure of obtaining restoratives for the luckless Royalist. The place for which
  the Roundhead captain was bound was Poynings, one of the prettiest and most
  picturesque villages amidst the South Downs, and then remarkable for its fine
  old manor-house appertaining to the baronial family that took its name from
  the place, as well as for its antique church, which latter still exists.</p>

  <p>Night was now coming on apace, but the sky was clear, and the light of the
  heavenly bodies dispelled the darkness. The hour of eight was tolled out as
  the little troop entered Poynings. The trampling of the horses quickly roused
  the villagers, and brought them to the doors of their cottages to see the
  soldiers pass, and great anxiety was evinced to obtain a glimpse of the
  malignant prisoner. But no near approach to him was permitted by the guard,
  and the curiosity of the spectators remained unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>A decent hostelry was soon found near the church, and here Stelfax
  alighted, and caused his prisoner, who was unable to dismount without
  assistance, to be lifted from the trooper&rsquo;s horse and carried inside.
  This service was rendered by the landlord, who announced himself to the
  Roundhead leader as Simon Piddinghoe, of the Poynings&rsquo; Arms, at the
  honourable captain&rsquo;s service. The Cavalier was supported by the
  assiduous host into a large, comfortable-looking house-place, with a wood
  fire blazing upon the hearth&mdash;deep inglenooks on either side of the
  chimney&mdash;and a couple of cozy benches with high backs calculated to keep
  off all draught advancing far into the room, with a long and strong oak table
  between them. On these high-backed benches some nine or ten guests were
  seated, smoking and quaffing the stout amber ale, the mulled sack, and other
  liquors for which the Poynings&rsquo; Arms was famed.</p>

  <p>The company consisted, as it turned out, of the village schoolmaster,
  Master Cisbury Oldfirle, who was accounted a man of parts and erudition, and
  who, at all events, considered himself such&mdash;two or three other
  inhabitants of the village of the better class&mdash;and a brace of sturdy
  farmers from the neighbourhood, who were discussing their evening pint, or
  quart, as it might be, before going home to their dames. Besides these, there
  were some other guests&mdash;nondescript individuals, whose precise position
  in society Simon Piddinghoe himself would have found it difficult to assign,
  and who might be disbanded Royalist soldiers, gentlemen out-at-elbows from
  drink or play, bankrupt tradesmen from London, or what you please. Shabby
  roysterers like these often took up their quarters in country hostels at the
  time&mdash;carefully selecting houses where good liquor and a good
  bowling-green were to be found; and notwithstanding their tarnished lace
  cloaks, threadbare doublets, and slouched Spanish hats, they were heartily
  welcomed by mine host&mdash;so long as they had wherewithal to pay the shot.
  To these personages the arrival of the Ironsides seemed to afford anything
  but satisfaction, though they endeavoured to put a good face upon their
  vexation, and rose with the rest of the company to salute the Roundhead
  captain on his entrance. All arose but one&mdash;a fierce, swashbuckling
  fellow, with a long rapier at his side, who was afterwards addressed by the
  host as Captain Goldspur. With a muttered oath, this personage pulled his
  slouched hat over his beetle-brows, shifted himself in his seat, and turned
  his back upon Stelfax. As the captive Cavalier was brought into the room, and
  the light of the fire illumined his features, Simon Piddinghoe gave a slight
  start of recognition; but a pressure of his arm by the prisoner cautioned him
  to hold his tongue.</p>

  <p>By Stelfax&rsquo;s directions the luckless gentleman was accommodated with
  an easy- chair near the fire, and a glass of strong water being administered
  to him by the host, he speedily began to revive.</p>

  <p>Meantime, the company had resumed their seats, though the questionable
  individuals we have described were evidently ill at ease, and Captain
  Goldspur, who puffed away furiously at his pipe, looked askance at Stelfax
  from beneath his heavy brows. But if he or his companions meditated any
  attack upon the Roundhead leader, the formidable appearance of the latter
  served to restrain them. Neither was Stelfax unsupported. His three men had
  entered the room and seated themselves at the further end of the benches,
  ready to obey their captain&rsquo;s slightest behest.</p>

  <p>However conversation might have gone on before the arrival of the
  Ironsides, it flagged now&mdash;the only person who maintained his character
  for loquacity being Cisbury Oldfirle. He talked on with his wonted
  volubility. Undismayed by Stelfax&rsquo;s stern looks, he entered into
  conversation with him, and gave him many particulars concerning the ancient
  family of Poynings, to which the other listened with some degree of
  attention, and then inquired whether the worshipful captain had heard the
  legend of the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke, and finding&mdash;as might be
  expected&mdash;that he had not, volunteered to relate it to
  him&mdash;premising that he could not entirely vouch for its authenticity.
  Having been supplied by the assiduous host with a bottle of admirably brewed
  sack, Stelfax felt disposed to accord the talkative pedagogue his attention,
  and listened with more patience than might have been expected to the weird,
  and somewhat extravagant, legend which will be found narrated&mdash;almost in
  Master Oldfirle&rsquo;s own language&mdash;in the next chapter.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-4"
     name="ch6-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  The Legend Of The Devil&rsquo;s Dyke<br>
  As Related By Master Cisbury Oldfirle,<br>
  Schoolmaster, Of Poynings</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE wondrous event I am about to detail happened in the time
  of the good Saint Cuthman of Steyning, in this county&mdash;a holy man, who
  from his extraordinary piety and austerity was believed to be endowed with
  supernatural power. Many miracles are attributed to him, some of which
  occurred long before his canonization. While yet a boy, and employed in
  tending his father&rsquo;s sheep on the downs, in order to pursue his
  devotional exercises undisturbed, he was wont to trace a large circle round
  the flock with his crook, beyond which none of them could stray, neither
  could any enemy approach them. Moreover, the good saint could punish the
  scoffer, as well as bless and sustain the lowly and the well-doer. Derided by
  certain blasphemous haymakers for carrying his palsied mother in a
  barrow&mdash;no better means of conveyance being at hand at the time&mdash;he
  brought down a heavy shower upon their heads, rendering their labour of no
  account; and thenceforward, whenever grass was cut and dried within that
  meadow, rain would fall upon it, and turn it to litter. Such was holy
  Cuthman&mdash;a man, you will perceive, whom it was necessary to treat with
  the respect due to his exalted virtues.</p>

  <p>At a later period of the saint&rsquo;s life, when his aged mother had gone
  from him, when he had built a wooden church with his own hands at
  Steyning&mdash;wherein, in the fulness of time, he was interred&mdash;and
  when his reputation for sanctity and austerity had greatly increased, causing
  him to be equally reverenced and dreaded&mdash;dreaded, I mean, by
  evil-doers, to whom he was especially obnoxious&mdash; the holy man walked
  forth one afternoon, in early autumn, wholly unattended, across the downs;
  his purpose being to visit a recluse, named Sister Ursula, who dwelt in a
  solitary cell on the summit of a hill adjoining Poynings, and whom he had
  been told was sick, and desirous of being shriven by him. Now Saint Cuthman
  had his staff in his hand, without which he never journeyed abroad, and he
  walked on until he reached the eminence for which he was bound. On the brow
  of this hill in former times the heathen invaders of the land had made a
  camp, vestiges of which may still be discerned. But it was not with these
  memorials of a bygone and benighted people that Saint Cuthman concerned
  himself. If he thought about the framers of those mighty earthworks at all,
  it was with thanksgiving that they had been swept away, and had given place
  to a generation to whom the purer and brighter light of the Gospel was
  vouchsafed.</p>

  <p>Thus communing with himself it may be, holy Cuthman reached the northern
  boundary of the rampart surrounding the old Roman camp, and cast his eyes
  over the vast Weald of Sussex, displayed before him like a map. The
  contemplation of this fair and fertile district filled his soul with
  gladness; but what chiefly rejoiced him was to note how the edifices reared
  for worship had multiplied since he first looked upon the extensive plain. He
  strove to count the numerous churches scattered about, but soon gave up the
  attempt&mdash;he might as well have tried to number the trees. But the
  difficulty he experienced increased his satisfaction, inasmuch as it proved
  to him that true religion had taken deep root in the land. And he gave glory
  and praise accordingly, where glory and praise are due.</p>

  <p>Scarcely were his audibly-uttered thanksgivings ended, when he became
  aware that some one stood nigh him, and turning his head, he beheld a tall
  man of singularly swarthy complexion, haughty mien, and eyes that seemed to
  burn like coals of fire. The habiliments of this mysterious and
  sinister-looking personage were of blood-red hue, and though their richness
  and the egret in his velvet cap betokened princely rank, he bore the
  implements of a common labourer&mdash;namely, a pickaxe and a shovel. No
  sound had proclaimed the stranger&rsquo;s approach, and his appearance was as
  sudden and startling as if he had risen from the earth. As Saint Cuthman
  regarded him with the aversion inspired by the sight of a venomous and deadly
  snake, yet wholly without fear, he knew that he was in the presence of the
  Author of III.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Comest thou to tempt me, accursed one?&rdquo; the holy man sternly
  demanded. &ldquo;If so, learn that I am proof against thy wiles. Depart from
  me, or I will summon good spirits that shall cast thee hence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou canst not do so,&rdquo; the inauspicious-looking stranger
  replied, laughing derisively. &ldquo;I am master here. Altars have been
  reared to strange gods upon this hill, and sacrifices made to
  them;&mdash;nay, I myself have been worshipped as Dis, and the blood of black
  bulls has been poured out upon the ground in mine honour. Therefore, the hill
  is mine, and thou thyself art an intruder upon it, and deservest to be cast
  down headlong into the plain. Yet will I spare thee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou darest not so much as injure a hair of my head,
  Sathanas,&rdquo; interrupted the Saint, in a menacing voice, and raising his
  staff as he spoke. &ldquo;Approach! and lightnings shall blast
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell thee I have no design to harm thee,&rdquo; returned the
  Fiend, with a look that showed he would willingly have rent the holy man in
  pieces. &ldquo;But give heed to what I am about to say. Vainly hast thou
  essayed to count the churches in the Sussex Weald, and thou hast glorified
  Heaven because of the number of the worshippers gathered within those fanes.
  Now mark me, thou servant of God! Thou hast taken a farewell look of that
  plain, so thickly studded with structures pleasing in thy sight, but an
  abomination to me. Before to-morrow morn, that vast district&mdash;far as
  thine eye can stretch&mdash;even to the foot of you distant Surrey
  hills&mdash;the whole Weald of Sessex, with its many churches, its churchmen,
  and its congregations, shall be whelmed beneath the sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou mockest me,&rdquo; returned Saint Cuthman, contemptuously;
  &ldquo;but I know thee to be the Father of Lies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Disbelieve me, if I fail in my task&mdash;not till then,&rdquo;
  said the Fiend. &ldquo;With the implements which I hold in my hand I will cut
  such a dyke through this hill, and through the hills lying between it and
  Hove, as shall let in the waters of the deep, so that all dwelling within
  yonder plain shall be drowned by them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thinkest thou thy evil work will be permitted?&rdquo; cried the
  Saint, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou, at least, canst not prevent it,&rdquo; rejoined the Fiend,
  with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;I will take my chance of other
  hindrance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The holy man appeared for a moment troubled, but his confidence was
  presently restored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou deceivest thy self,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The task thou
  proposest to execute is beyond thy power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beyond my power!&rdquo; exclaimed the Demon. &ldquo;It is a trifle
  in comparison with what I can achieve. I have had a hand in many wonderful
  works, some of which are recognized as mine, though I have not got credit for
  a tithe of those I have performed. Devil&rsquo;s bridges are common enough,
  methinks, in mountainous gorges&mdash;devil&rsquo;s towers are by no means
  rare in old castles. Most of the camps upon these downs were planned and
  executed by me&mdash;the very rampart upon which we stand being partly my
  work. The first Csar has got the credit of many of my performances, and he
  is welcome to it. He is not the only man who has worn laurels belonging by
  right to others. Saint as thou art, it is meet thou give the devil his due.
  Do so, and thou must needs praise his industry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy industry in evil-doing in unquestionable,&rdquo; rejoined the
  Saint. &ldquo;But good work is out of thy power. Thou darest not affirm that
  thou hast had any hand in the erection of temples and holy piles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask thy compeers, Saint Dunstan and Saint Augustine&mdash;they will
  tell thee differently. But I disdain to boast. I have certainly had no hand
  in thy ugly little wooden church at Steyning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thy present feat is to be performed before to-morrow, thou
  sayest?&rdquo; demanded the Saint, highly offended at this uncalled-for
  allusion to his own favourite structure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between sunset and sunrise, most saintly sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is but a short time for so mighty a task,&rdquo; said the holy
  man, in an incredulous tone. &ldquo;Bethink thee a September night is not a
  long night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The shortest night is long enough for me,&rdquo; the Fiend replied.
  &ldquo;If the dawn comes and finds my work incomplete, thou shalt be at
  liberty to deride me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall never treat thee otherwise than with scorn,&rdquo; the
  Saint rejoined. &ldquo;But thou hast said it, and I hold thee to thy word.
  Between sunset and sunrise thy task must be done. If thou failest&mdash;from
  whatever cause&mdash;thy evil scheme shall be for ever abandoned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be it so! I am content,&rdquo; the Fiend rejoined. &ldquo;But I
  shall not fail,&rdquo; he added, with a fearful laugh. &ldquo;Come hither at
  sunset, and thou wilt see me commence my work. Thou mayst tarry nigh me, if
  thou wilt, till it be done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven forfend that it should be done!&rdquo; ejaculated the Saint,
  casting his eyes upwards.</p>

  <p>When he looked up again towards the spot where the Evil one had stood, he
  could no more perceive him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed the good Saint, allowing his gaze to wander
  over the smiling and far-stretching Weald, &ldquo;I cannot believe that I am
  taking farewell of this lovely plain. I cannot for an instant believe that
  its destruction will be permitted. Its people have not sinned, but have
  incurred the hatred of the Arch- Fiend solely because of their piety and
  zeal. It shall be my business to defeat his hateful design.</p>

  <p>The holy man turned away, and quitting the camp, proceeded in an easterly
  direction over the hill, until he came to a small stone structure, standing
  near a grey old thorn-tree, on an acclivity covered with gorse and heather.
  The occupant of this solitary cell belonged to a priory of Benedictine nuns,
  situated at Leominster, near Arundel, and attached to the Abbey of
  Almenesches, in Normandy. Sister Ursula Braose had retired to this lonesome
  spot in order to pass the whole of her time in devotion, and had acquired a
  reputation for sanctity and asceticism scarcely inferior to that of holy
  Cuthman himself. She was a daughter of the noble house of Braose of Bramber
  Castle. Once a week the purveyor of the priory at Leominster brought her a
  scanty supply of provisions (for the poor soul needed but little), and it was
  from him that Saint Cuthman had heard of her illness, and of her desire to be
  shriven by him.</p>

  <p>He found the recluse occupied in her devotions. She was kneeling before an
  ivory crucifix fastened against the wall of her cell, and was so absorbed as
  to be entirely unconscious of the Saint&rsquo;s approach. He did not make his
  presence known to her till she had done. Sister Ursula Braose had once been
  remarkable for beauty, but years, the austere life she had led, and the
  frequent and severe penances she had undergone, had obliterated all traces of
  loveliness from her features. She was old and wrinkled now; her hair white as
  snow, and her fingers thin as those of a skeleton. She was clothed in a loose
  black robe, with a cincture of cord round her waist. Reverentially saluting
  the holy man, she prayed him to be seated upon a stool, which, with another
  small seat hewn out of stone, a stone table, and a straw pallet, formed the
  entire furniture of her cell. An iron lamp hung by a chain from the roof. On
  the table were placed a missal written on vellum, an hour-glass, and a small
  taper.</p>

  <p>After inquiring as to her ailments, and expressing his satisfaction that
  she felt somewhat better, Saint Cuthman said, &ldquo;Are you still fasting,
  sister? I know you are wont only to break bread and drink water after the
  hour of vespers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since yestere&rsquo;en, nothing has passed my lips, holy
  father,&rdquo; the recluse replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the Saint. &ldquo;The prohibition I am
  about to lay upon you&mdash;painful to any other, unaccustomed to severe
  mortification of the flesh&mdash;will by you be scarcely accounted a penance.
  I enjoin you to refrain from all refreshment of the body, whether by food or
  rest, until to-morrow morning. Think you, you can promise compliance with the
  order?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I think it, holy father?&rdquo; Sister Ursula cried. &ldquo;If
  Heaven will spare me so long, I am sure of it. I was in hopes,&rdquo; she
  added, almost with a look of disappointment, &ldquo;that you were about to
  enjoin me some severe discipline, such as my sinfulness merits, and I pray
  you to add sharp flagellations, or other wholesome correction of the flesh,
  to your mandate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; rejoined the Saint, smiling at the recluse&rsquo;s
  zeal; &ldquo;the scourge is unneeded. You have no heavy offence, I am well
  assured, on your conscience. But keep strict vigil throughout the night, and
  suffer not sleep to weigh down your eyelids for a moment, or you may be
  exposed to temptation and danger. The Arch- Fiend himself will be
  abroad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will spend the livelong night in prayer,&rdquo; said Sister
  Ursula, trembling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; returned the Saint; &ldquo;the Prince of
  Darkness has other business on hand, and will not trouble you. He will be
  engaged in a terrible work, but, with Heaven&rsquo;s aid, good sister, yours
  shall be the hand to confound him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; exclaimed the recluse, seeking by her looks for an
  explanation from the holy man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When the sun hath gone down,&rdquo; rejoined Saint Cuthman,
  &ldquo;which will be about the seventh hour, turn this hour-glass, and let
  the sand run out six times&mdash;six times, do you mark, good sister? That
  will bring you to the first hour after midnight. Kneel then before yon
  crucifix and pray fervently, that the dark designs of him who took our
  Saviour to the top of the high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of
  the world in a moment, may be defeated. Next, light this taper, which I will
  presently consecrate; set it within the bars of that little grated window
  looking towards the east, and pray that its glimmer may be as the first grey
  light of dawn. Again, I say, do you mark me, sister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a word uttered by you, holy father, but hath sunk deep in my
  breast,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Your instructions shall be scrupulously
  obeyed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing evil shall cross this threshold during the night,&rdquo;
  pursued the Saint. &ldquo;I will guard it as, in the days of my youth, I
  guarded my father&rsquo;s flocks on the hills. Light not your lamp but only
  the taper, as I have bidden you; and stir not forth on any threat or summons,
  for such will only be a snare to injure you; and let not your heart quail
  because of the frightful sounds you may hear. Though the earth should quake
  beneath your feet, and this solid hill tremble to its foundations, yet shall
  not a stone of your cell be removed, neither shall any harm befall
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Saint then took up the taper, and blessed it in these terms:
  &ldquo;Domine Jesu Christi, fili Dei vivi, benedic candelam istam
  supplicationibus nostris: infunde ei, Domine, per virtutem sanct&oelig;
  crucis benedictionem c&oelig;lestem; ut quibuscumque locis accensa, sive
  posita fuerit, discedant principes tenebrarum, et contremiscant, et fugiunt
  pavidi cum omnibus ministris suis ab habitationibus illis; nec
  pr&oelig;sumant amplius inquietare, aut molestare servientes tibi omnipotenti
  Deo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After going through certain other ceremonials, which it is needless to
  describe, the Saint sat down, and addressing Sister Ursula, declared his
  readiness to shrive her.</p>

  <p>The recluse then knelt down before him, and inclining her head so as to
  conceal her features, said she had one secret within her breast which she had
  never revealed to her confessor&mdash;one sin upon her soul, of which she had
  never been able to repent.</p>

  <p>After duly reproving her, the Saint told her to make clean her breast by
  confession, declaring she would then be able to repent.</p>

  <p>Thus exhorted, Sister Ursula replied, in accents half suffocated by
  irrepressible emotion: &ldquo;My secret is, that I loved you&mdash;you, holy
  father&mdash;when I was young: my unrepented sin is, that I have never been
  able to banish that love from my heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! sister,&rdquo; rejoined the holy man, trembling in spite of
  himself, &ldquo;we have been equally unhappy. In days, long gone by, I could
  not behold unmoved the charms of the fair and noble Lady Ursula Braose. But I
  conquered the passion, and repented that I had ever indulged it. Thou must do
  likewise. The struggle may be hard, but strength will be given thee for it.
  Hast thou aught more to confess?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the poor recluse, who shed abundance of tears, replying in the
  negative, the Saint gave her absolution, saying that the penance he had
  already enjoined was sufficient, and that ere the morrow her breast would be
  free from its load. Struck by her looks, which were those of one not long for
  this world, he told her that if her sickness should prove mortal, dirges and
  trentals should be said for the repose of her soul.</p>

  <p>The recluse thanked him, and after a while became composed and even
  cheerful.</p>

  <p>Saint Cuthman tarried in the cell, discoursing with her upon the glorious
  prospects of futurity, and carefully avoiding any reference to the past,
  until, from the door of the little structure, which opened toward the west,
  he beheld the sun sink into the sea. Telling the good sister that a thousand
  lives depended upon her vigilance, he gave her his benediction and departed,
  never more to behold her alive.</p>

  <p>As he took his way towards the north-eastern boundary of the ancient
  encampment, a noise resembling thunder smote his ear, and the ground shook so
  violently beneath his feet that he could scarcely stand, but reeled to and
  fro, as if his brain&mdash;his! whose lips no drink stronger than water had
  ever passed&mdash;had been assailed by the fumes of wine. Nevertheless, he
  went on, and, after a while, reached the lofty headland overlooking
  Poynings.</p>

  <p>Here, as he expected, he beheld the Arch-Fiend at work. The infernal
  excavator had already made a great breach into the down, and enormous
  fragments of chalk and flint-stones rolled down with a terrific crash, like
  that caused by an avalanche amidst the Alps. Every stroke of his terrible
  pickaxe shook the hill to its centre. No one, who was not sustained by
  supernatural power, could have stood firmly upon the quaking headland. But
  Saint Cuthman, planting his staff upon the ground, remained unmoved&mdash;the
  only human witness of the astounding scene. The Fiend&rsquo;s proportions had
  now become colossal, and he looked like one of that giant race whom poets of
  heathendom tell us warred against Jove. His garb was suited to his task, and
  resembled that of a miner. His brawny and hirsute arms were bared to the
  shoulder, and the curled goat&rsquo;s-horns were visible on his uncovered
  head. His implements had become enormous as himself, and the broadest and
  heaviest anchor-fluke ever forged was as nought to the curved iron head of
  his pickaxe. Each stroke plunged fathom-deep into the ground, and tore up
  huge boulder-like masses of chalk, the smallest of which might have loaded a
  wain. The Fiend worked away with might and main, and the concussion produced
  by his tremendous strokes was incessant and terrible, echoing far over the
  Weald like the rattling of a dreadful thunderstorm.</p>

  <p>But the sand ran out, and Sister Ursula turned her glass for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Fiend stopped, and clapped his hand to his side, as if in
  pain&mdash;&rdquo; A sharp stitch!&rdquo; quoth he. &ldquo;My side tingles as
  if pricked by a thousand pins. The sensation is by no means
  pleasant&mdash;but &lsquo;twill soon pass!&rdquo; Then perceiving the Saint
  watching him, he called out derisively&mdash;&rdquo; Aha! art thou there,
  thou saintly man? What thinkest thou now of the chance of escape for thy
  friends in the Weald? Thou art a judge of such matters, I doubt not. Is my
  Dyke broad enough and profound enough, thinkest thou&mdash;or shall I widen
  it and deepen it yet more?&rdquo; And the chasm resounded with his mocking
  laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art but a slovenly workman, after all,&rdquo; remarked Saint
  Cuthman. &ldquo;The sides of thy Dyke are rough and uneven, and want
  levelling. A mortal labourer would be shrewdly reprimanded if he left them in
  such an untidy condition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No mortal labourer could make such a trench,&rdquo; cried the
  Fiend. &ldquo;However, it shall never be said that I am a slovenly
  workman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon he seized his spade, and proceeded to level the banks of the
  Dyke, carefully removing all roughness and irregularity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will that satisfy thy precise notions?&rdquo; he called out, when
  he had done.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot deny that it looks better,&rdquo; returned the holy man,
  glad to think that another hour had passed&mdash;for a soft touch falling
  upon his brow made him aware that, at this moment, Sister Ursula had turned
  the hour-glass for the second time.</p>

  <p>A sharp sudden pain smote the Fiend, and made him roar out lustily,
  &ldquo;Another stitch, and worse than the first! But it shall not hinder my
  task.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again he fell to work. Again, the hill was shaken to its base. Again,
  mighty masses of chalk were hurled into the valley, crushing everything upon
  which they descended. Again, the strokes of the pickaxe echoed throughout the
  Weald.</p>

  <p>It was now dark. But the fiery breath of the Demon sufficed to light him
  in his task. He toiled away with right good will, for the Devil can work hard
  enough, I promise you, if the task be to his mind. All at once he suspended
  his labour. The hourglass had been turned for the third time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter with thee?&rdquo; demanded the Saint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; replied the writhing Fiend. &ldquo;A sudden
  attack of cramp in the arms and legs, I fancy. I must have caught cold on
  these windy downs. I will do a little lighter work till the fit passes
  off.&rdquo; Upon this, he took up the shovel and began to trim the sides of
  the Dyke as before.</p>

  <p>While he was thus engaged, the further end of the chasm closed up, so that
  when he took up the pickaxe once more he had all his work to do again. This
  caused him to snort and roar like a mad bull, and so much flame and smoke
  issued from his mouth and nostrils, that the bottom of the Dyke resembled the
  bed of a volcano.</p>

  <p>Sister Ursula then turned the glass for the fourth time. Hereupon, an
  enormous mass of breccia, or gold-stone, as the common folk call it, which
  the Fiend had dislodged, rolled down upon his foot, and crushed it. This so
  enraged him, that he sent the fragment of gold-stone whizzing over the hills
  to Hove. What with rubbing his bruised foot, and roaring, a quarter of an
  hour elapsed before he could resume his work.</p>

  <p>The fifth turning of the glass gave him such pains in the back, that for
  some minutes he was completely disabled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An attack of lumbago,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I seem liable to all
  mortal ailments to- night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hadst better desist,&rdquo; said the Saint. &ldquo;The next
  attack may cripple thee for all time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am all right again,&rdquo; shouted the Demon. &ldquo;It was but a
  passing seizure, like those that have gone before it. Thou shalt now see what
  I can do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he began to ply his pickaxe with greater energy than ever; toiling on
  without intermission, filling the chasm with flame from his fiery nostrils,
  and producing the effect of a continuous thunderstorm over the Weald. Thus he
  wrought on, I say, uninterruptedly, for the space of another hour.</p>

  <p>Sister Ursula had turned the glass for the last time.</p>

  <p>The Fiend was suddenly checked&mdash;but not this time by pains in the
  limbs, or prostration of strength. He had struck the pickaxe so deeply into
  the chalk that he could not remove it. He strained every nerve to pluck it
  forth, but it continued firmly embedded, and the helve, which was thick as
  the mainmast of a ship, and of toughest oak, broke in his grasp.</p>

  <p>While he was roaring like an infuriated lion with rage and mortification,
  Saint Cuthman called out to him to come forth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wherefore should I come forth?&rdquo; the Fiend cried. &ldquo;Thou
  thinkest I am baffled; but thou art mistaken. I will dig out my axe-head
  presently, and my shovel will furnish me with a new handle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cease, if thou canst, for a short space, to breathe forth flame and
  smoke; and look towards the east,&rdquo; cried the Saint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a glimmer of light in the sky in that quarter!&rdquo;
  exclaimed the Demon, holding his breath; &ldquo;but dawn cannot be come
  already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The streak of light grows rapidly wider and brighter,&rdquo; said
  the Saint. &ldquo;The shades of night are fleeing fast away. The larks are
  beginning to rise and carol forth their matin hymns on the downs. The rooks
  are cawing amid the trees of the park beneath us. The cattle are lowing in
  the meads&mdash;and hark! dost thou not hear the cooks crowing in the
  adjacent village of Poynings?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cocks crowing at Poynings!&rdquo; yelled the Fiend. &ldquo;It must
  be the dawn. But the sun shall not behold my discomfiture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hide thy head in darkness, accursed being!&rdquo; exclaimed the
  Saint, raising his staff. &ldquo;Hence with thee! and return not to this
  hill. The dwellers within the Sussex Weald are saved from thy malice, and may
  henceforth worship without fear. Get thee hence, I say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abashed by the awful looks of the Saint, the Demon fled. Howling with
  rage, like a wild beast robbed of its prey, he ran to the northern boundary
  of the rampart surrounding the camp, where the marks of his gigantic feet may
  still be seen indelibly impressed on the sod. Then springing off, and
  unfolding his sable pinions, he soared over the Weald, alighting on Leith
  Hill.</p>

  <p>Just as he took flight, Sister Ursula&rsquo;s taper went out. Instant
  darkness fell upon the hill, and Night resumed her former sway. The village
  cocks ceased crowing, the larks paused in their songs and dropped to the
  ground like stones, the rooks returned to roost, and the lowing herds became
  silent.</p>

  <p>Saint Cuthman had to make a considerable circuit to reach Sister
  Ursula&rsquo;s cell, a deep gulf having been placed between it and the
  headland on which he had taken his stand. On arriving at the little structure
  he found that the recluse&rsquo;s troubles were over Her loving heart had for
  ever ceased to beat. Her failing strength had sufficed to turn the hour-glass
  for the last time, and just as the consecrated taper expired, she passed
  away. In death, she still retained the attitude of prayer&mdash;her clasped
  hands being raised heavenwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suspice Domine, preces nostras pro anim famul&oelig; tu&oelig;; ut
  si qu&oelig; ei macul&oelig; de terrenis contagiis adh&oelig;serunt,
  remissionis tu&oelig; misericordia deleantur!&rdquo; ejaculated the holy man.
  &ldquo;She could not have had a better ending! May my own be like it! She
  shall have sepulture in my mother&rsquo;s grave at Steyning. And masses and
  trentals, according to my promise, shall be said for the repose of her soul.
  Peace be with her!&rdquo; And he went on his way.</p>

  <p>Thus was the Demon banished by Saint Cuthman from that hill overlooking
  the fair Sussex Weald, and the people of the plain ever after prayed in
  peace. But the Devil&rsquo;s handiwork&mdash;the unfinished Dyke&mdash;exists
  to this day. Though I never heard that his pickaxe has been found.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-5"
     name="ch6-5">CHAPTER V<br>
  How Stelfax Took The Cavalier To The Grange;<br>
  And What Happened By The Way</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOME few interruptions were offered to the
  schoolmaster&rsquo;s narration both by Stelfax and his men; and when it came
  to an end, the Roundhead leader observed that it was a monkish and
  superstitious legend, fit only for old wives and children, and that for his
  own part he did not believe in the pretended miracles of Saint Cuthman, or
  those of any other Romish saint in the calendar. On this observation being
  made, Captain Goldspur got up, and looking as if he would no longer remain in
  the company of a person who expressed such heterodox opinions, he was
  marching out of the room, when, at a sign from Stelfax, two of the troopers
  caught hold of him, and forced him back to his seat. In doing this, they
  deprived him of his long rapier, which Stelfax consigned to the host, bidding
  him put it aside for the present. In an authoritative tone the Roundhead
  leader then informed the company that none of them must leave the house until
  after his departure with the prisoner&mdash;a piece of good news to Simon
  Piddinghoe, who ventured to express a hope that the worshipful captain would
  prolong his stay to as late an hour as possible. Stelfax, indeed, seemed in
  no hurry to depart. His seat by the fireside was very comfortable, and the
  mulled sack super-excellent&mdash;so remarkably good, indeed, that, having
  finished his pottle during the progress of the schoolmaster&rsquo;s legend,
  he ordered the host to brew a second.</p>

  <p>By this time, the prisoner had shaken off in a great measure the effects
  of his fall. Of a reckless turn, like most Cavaliers, he either felt&mdash;or
  feigned to feel&mdash;indifferent to his present position. His chair was next
  that of Stelfax, and hearing the praises bestowed by the latter upon the
  sack, he begged to be allowed a measure for himself&mdash;and the favour was
  unhesitatingly granted. After the failure of his attempt to march off,
  Captain Goldspur&rsquo;s audacity seemed to forsake him, and withdrawing as
  far as he could from the presence of the hateful Stelfax, he lapsed into
  gloomy silence. His companions were equally taciturn and moody. But the rest
  of the company took no umbrage at their detention, appearing rather pleased
  by the excuse it offered them for making a night of it. Whether Stelfax sat
  long to vex Goldspur and his sullen comrades&mdash;or whether, as is more
  probable, he felt disposed to rest and enjoy himself after a hard day&rsquo;s
  work&mdash;certain it is that eleven o&rsquo;clock had struck ere he rose to
  depart. The reckoning was then paid&mdash;rather to Simon Piddinghoe&rsquo;s
  surprise, for the soldiers of the Republic were not notorious for
  scrupulously discharging their scores; the horses were brought out; the
  prisoner was placed on the crupper behind Nathan Guestling, and strapped to
  that stout trooper as he had previously been. All these arrangements made,
  Stelfax mounted, and after partaking of a stirrup-cup proffered by the host,
  put himself at the head of the little troop, and rode out of Poynings.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the Roundhead leader&rsquo;s injunctions to the contrary,
  one person had contrived to slip out of the house unobserved. When the host
  returned to his guests to tell them they were now free to depart if they were
  so minded, he remarked that Captain Goldspur was gone, and had taken his
  rapier with him. Upon which he muttered, &ldquo;There will be mischief, I
  fear&mdash;And who, think you, yon red-coated knaves have got as a prisoner,
  my worthy masters?&rdquo; he added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I know not,&rdquo; the schoolmaster rejoined. &ldquo;Who
  should it be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No other than Colonel George Gunter of Racton,&rdquo; the host
  replied; &ldquo;as worthy a gentleman as any in the county, and as staunch a
  partisan as ever breathed of the&mdash;of&mdash;You know whom I
  mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was that Colonel Gunter of Racton?&rdquo; cried a personage in a
  tarnished lace cloak and dilapidated Spanish hat. &ldquo;Would I had known
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what wouldst thou have done, Master Jervoise
  Rumboldsdyke?&rdquo; demanded the inquisitive schoolmaster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; the other rejoined. &ldquo;It may not yet be too
  late. Tell me the way taken by those cursed troopers,&rdquo; he added to the
  host.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They rode towards Patcham,&rdquo; Simon Piddinghoe replied.
  &ldquo;No doubt they are bound for Lewes, where the detachment is
  quartered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Lewes!&rdquo; exclaimed Rumboldsdyke. &ldquo;To Lewes, then, let
  us hie. Here is thy reckoning, mine host.&rdquo; And flinging a double-crown
  upon the table he rushed out of the house, followed by his comrades.</p>

  <p>It was a clear starlight night, and by no means dark. Stelfax kept a
  little in advance of his men, but did not urge his horse beyond a walk. Their
  road lay partly along a valley, partly over a lower range of downs. After a
  while, they reached Patcham, and were passing the thick hanging wood on the
  hill-side, when a pistol&mdash;for such the fire-arm seemed to be from its
  report&mdash;was discharged at Stelfax. The bullet struck the Roundhead
  leader&rsquo;s gorget, but did him no injury. He instantly turned, and
  dashing to the edge of the wood, called, in a voice of thunder, upon his
  dastardly assailant to show himself, and come forth if he dared. But no
  answer was returned to the summons, neither could any lurking assassin be
  detected. Deeming search useless at such an hour, Stelfax set off again; but
  he now mended his pace, and being under no apprehension of losing his way, he
  rode over the silent and solitary downs in the direction of Ovingdean, where
  he arrived without further molestation of any kind, and deposited his
  prisoner at the Grange.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6-6"
     name="ch6-6">CHAPTER VI<br>
  By What Means The Prisoners Escaped From The Church</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We must now return to the church, and see what the
  disorderly rout left within it were about. It was past midnight. The torches
  were still blazing, but the thick vapour that rose from their flames,
  combined with the tobacco-smoke, filled the whole body of the fabric, and so
  obscured its-more distant portions, that the arched screen separating the
  chancel from the nave could scarcely be discerned. The light, struggling
  through this vapour, only imperfectly revealed the figures of the Ironsides
  stretched upon the benches, some of them, as we have said, asleep, and the
  rest in a drowsy state, half-stupefied with drink. All their boisterous
  merriment had long since ceased, and nothing was heard but the heavy
  breathing of the slumbering topers. All at once, a slight noise reached the
  ears of the sergeant, and looking in the direction whence it proceeded, he
  thought he discerned a dark figure in the pulpit. After steadily regarding
  the object for a few moments, during which it continued perfectly motionless,
  a superstitious terror took possession of Delves, and be began to think it
  was the Enemy of Mankind standing before him in prison. Rousing up Besadaiah
  Eavestaff, who was near to him, he directed his attention to the mysterious
  figure, and asked him, in accents that betrayed his alarm, what he thought of
  it?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the Evil One,&rdquo; Besadaiah rejoined, rubbing his eyes.
  &ldquo;But how comes he here, in yonder pulpit, and in the garb of a minister
  of the Church? I am not afraid&mdash;I will address him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this he got up, and supporting himself with his carabine, staggered
  towards the pulpit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he drew near, &ldquo;I have it now,
  sergeant. Whom dost thou think his Satanic Majesty turns out to be? No other
  than Master Increase Micklegift, the Independent minister, whom we ejected
  from the neighbouring mansion by our captain&rsquo;s commands. How comes he
  here? Doth he take up his abode altogether within this church?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it be indeed Master Micklegift, and not an evil spirit in his
  form,&rdquo; Delves rejoined, &rdquo; question him thyself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shall not need to do so,&rdquo; cried Micklegift, for it was he.
  &ldquo;I have placed myself here to see how you who profess to be soldiers
  fighting for the cause of religion and truth would comport yourselves, and I
  find that ye are as riotous and intemperate as the scoffers, brawlers, and
  tipplers whom ye profess to reprobate. Are ye not ashamed to be wallowing in
  drunkenness when ye should watch and pray? Call ye yourselves good soldiers
  of the Republic? You are said to be the favoured host of our great Joshua,
  Cromwell; but is it by conduct like this that you have earned his regard?
  Hardly so, methinks! If you must needs turn this tabernacle into a place of
  duresse for your prisoners, why should you thus defile it? For your
  profaneness and irreverence ye ought to be driven forth with stripes, and if
  a judgment should fall upon your heads ye will have richly merited
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; exclaimed Besadaiah; &ldquo;I will hear no more from
  thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, there is reason in what the good man saith,&rdquo; cried.
  Delves. &ldquo;We deserve his rebukes. It must be owned that our conduct this
  night hath not been in accordance either with our principles or our
  duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our captain mislikes this man, and suspects him of being in league
  with the malignants,&rdquo; cried Besadaiah. &ldquo;By his own showing he
  hath been playing the spy upon us. Let him come down from that pulpit, and
  free us at once from his presence, or I will send a bullet through his
  brain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou darest not lift thy hand against me, thou sacrilegious
  ruffian,&rdquo; thundered Micklegift. &ldquo;My purpose is to hold forth unto
  thee and to thy comrades, and to strive to awaken ye all to a sense of your
  sinfulness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will be labour thrown away, worthy sir,&rdquo; said Delves,
  &ldquo;so I pray you forbear. With what intent you have come hither, and
  hidden yourself away until this moment, is best known to your secret heart.
  But such conduct is questionable, and seems to justify our captain&rsquo;s
  doubts as to your sincerity to the cause. I have prisoners in charge here, as
  you are aware-prisoners for whose security I am responsible. I cannot tell
  but you may have some design to give them aid, and must therefore enjoin you
  to quit the church without delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What if I refuse to go?&rdquo; rejoined Micklegift. &ldquo;What if,
  in my turn, I command thee and thy sacrilegious crew to depart from the
  tabernacle which ye have profaned? &ldquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will do well not to provoke me further,&rdquo; Besadaiah cried,
  in a menacing voice, and levelling his musket at the Independent minister as
  he spoke. &ldquo;Come down, I say, at once, and quit the church&mdash;or that
  pulpit shall be thy coffin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put down thy weapon, Besadaiah, and harm not the man,&rdquo;
  interposed Delves. &ldquo;Though his conduct be suspicious, he may have no
  ill intent. Hearken unto me, Master Micklegift, and compel me not to have
  recourse to harsh measures with thee. Thou canst not stay here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The church is mine, and nothing but force shall make me quit
  it,&rdquo; cried Micklegift, vehemently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I grieve to hear you say so,&rdquo; the sergeant rejoined. &ldquo;I
  desire not to use violence, but your obstinacy will leave me no other
  alternative.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better let me put an end to the discussion, sergeant,&rdquo;
  growled Besadaiah, again raising his carabine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in that way, I tell thee,&rdquo; Delves rejoined. &ldquo;For
  the last time, I say unto thee, Master Micklegift, wilt thou depart
  peaceably, or must I put thee forth?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not leave mine own church at thine, or at any man&rsquo;s
  bidding,&rdquo; the Independent minister rejoined; &ldquo;and I counsel thee
  not to attempt to use force against me, or thou wilt rue it. Lay but a finger
  upon me, and I will render thine arm powerless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! this is idle vaunting!&rdquo; the sergeant exclaimed.
  &ldquo;Since thou wilt not be advised, thou must take the
  consequences.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; it is thou who must take the consequences, sergeant. I have
  warned thee,&rdquo; Micklegift rejoined, raising his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aid me to put him forth, Besadaiah,&rdquo; said Delves, &ldquo;for
  I perceive he is disposed to offer resistance. But take heed thou doest him
  no injury.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rearing his carabine against the door of a pew, he marched towards the
  pulpit. Besadaiah also laid down his musket, and followed him. But scarcely
  had the foremost of the two Ironsides set foot on the pulpit-steps, when
  Micklegift clapped his hands together, and called out with a loud voice,
  &ldquo;Arise!&mdash;it is time!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the signal, for such it proved, two persons suddenly sprang up behind
  the troopers, and in an instant possessed themselves of the carabines which
  had been so imprudently abandoned. These personages, it soon appeared, were
  no other than the Saxbys, father and son, who had contrived to secrete
  themselves until this moment within the chancel. Levelling the gun at the
  Roundhead soldiers, Ninian and his father threatened to shoot them if they
  stirred a step. It was now Micklegift&rsquo;s turn to triumph. Not only had
  his signal summoned the Saxbys from their hiding-place, but at the same
  moment the prisoners burst forth from the interior of the tower, and so
  unexpectedly, that ere the drunken and drowsy troopers could recover from
  their surprise and seize their arms, they were deprived of them by their
  assailants. Aided by circumstances, the stratagem completely succeeded. All
  the&rsquo; fire-arms were secured by the Royalists. Helpless Henly was so
  overcome by the liquor he had swallowed, that he could not raise himself from
  the ground; and two others were in nearly the like state. The Royalists now
  numbered five, but as they had obtained possession of all the muskets and
  pistols belonging to the troop, it followed that they were completely masters
  of the position. Without much difficulty, the newly liberated prisoners
  succeeded in driving such of the Ironsides as were capable of offering
  resistance into the tower which they themselves had so recently occupied, and
  locked the door upon them. This done, they turned their attention to Delves
  and Besadaiah, over whom the two Saxbys still kept guard, with levelled
  muskets. On coming up, John Habergeon at once rushed in and grappled with the
  sergeant, while Ninian and his father laid hold of Besadaiah. A coil of rope
  which had been brought in by the troopers was soon found by Micklegift, who
  by this time had descended from the pulpit, and with it Delves and his
  comrade were bound hand and foot, and handkerchiefs tied over their mouths.
  Though the trouble seemed needless, similar precautions were taken with
  Helpless Henly and the two other equally inert troopers; and only one of them
  stirred and opened his eyes while the cords were being fastened round his
  wrists.</p>

  <p>The Royalists next transformed themselves into the semblance of Republican
  soldiers, by putting on the habiliments and accoutrements of their enemies,
  equipping themselves in the scarlet doublets, tassets, breastplates,
  headpieces, and bandoleers of the Ironsides, buckling on their swords, and
  appropriating their carabines and pistols. These operations were conducted as
  expeditiously as possible, for the troopers shut up within the tower had
  begun to vociferate loudly, and make as much noise as they could, in the hope
  of giving the alarm; and though the thick walls of the chamber in which they
  were enclosed greatly deadened the clamour, still the Royalists did not know
  whether it might not be heard at the Grange. So the utmost dispatch was used.
  And no sooner was their task accomplished, than the newly released prisoners,
  with their deliverers, Micklegift and the two Saxbys, quitted the church,
  locking the door upon their foes.</p>

  <p>On issuing from the church, Micklegift quitted the party, and hastened to
  the parsonage, to make preparations for instant flight. For some time
  Ovingdean would be no safe place for him. The Royalists agreed to keep
  together for the present, unless circumstances should require them to
  separate. Command of the little party naturally devolved upon Lord Wilmot,
  and his first instructions were to proceed to the stables, and help
  themselves to the troopers&rsquo; horses.</p>

  <p>By this time the moon had risen, but her lustre was frequently obscured by
  passing clouds. Not being familiar with the locality, Lord Wilmot placed
  himself under the guidance of Ninian Saxby, who now led the way to the
  stables. As the young falconer marched along in this unaccustomed guise of
  steel cap and breastplate, he almost lost the sense of his own identity, and
  while eyeing his accoutrements with secret satisfaction, flattered himself
  that he made a very smart soldier, and only regretted that Patty Whinchat
  could not behold him.</p>

  <p>The party were crossing the valley a little to the south of the Grange,
  when the sound of their footsteps attracted the attention of the patrol at
  the door of the mansion. The sentinel immediately advanced to the gate, and
  challenged them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are ye that go there?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; responded John Habergeon, in the true puritanical
  snuffle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Advance, friends, and give the countersign,&rdquo; rejoined the
  sentinel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maccabaeus and his company,&rdquo; John replied, having luckily
  overheard the watchword whispered by the sergeant to his men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pass on, then,&rdquo; cried the trooper. &rdquo; Yet stay!-whither
  go ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the stables, by order of Sergeant Delves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good!&mdash;but what means the clamour within the
  church?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is caused by the malignant prisoners, who like not their
  lodging,&rdquo; John replied, with a laugh, which was echoed by the
  trooper,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feared something might have
  gone wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hath aught been heard of our captain? demanded Lord Wilmot,
  disguising his voice as well as he was able.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He returned half an hour ago with the prisoner,&rdquo; replied the
  sentinel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear that? &ldquo;Lord Wilmot observed in a low voice to
  Clavering. &ldquo;Colonel Gunter is taken. He must be rescued at any
  cost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you go back to the church after seeing to the horses, or are
  some of us to take your place?&rdquo; inquired the sentinel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will return presently and ascertain the captain&rsquo;s
  pleasure,&rdquo; returned Lord Wilmot.</p>

  <p>Upon this the Royalists moved on, and the sentinel went back to his
  post.</p>

  <p>In another minute the party reached the stables. Opening the door, Ninian
  quickly roused up a couple of grooms who were lying asleep on a pile of
  straw. A lighted horn lantern was hanging by a pulley overhead. At first the
  grooms took the whole party for Republican soldiers, and seemed reluctant to
  get up, but when Ninian made himself known, they quickly bestirred
  themselves. Each stall had a couple of horses within it; but though the
  stables were large, there was not accommodation for so many, and several of
  the troopers&rsquo; steeds had been placed in the cow-house. It was in the
  latter place that Lord Wilmot found his own charger. Having selected such
  horses as they thought would best suit them&mdash;keeping one for Colonel
  Gunter, in case they should succeed in liberating him&mdash;they turned all
  the others loose in the farm-yard, hiding away the saddles and bridles.</p>

  <p>But just as the party issued forth from the stables with their newly
  acquired steeds, an alarming sound reached their ears.</p>

  <p>The bell of the church began to toll.</p>

  <p>How it could be rung by the imprisoned Ironsides, the Royalists could not
  conjecture, for they had seen no bell-rope; but so it was. The bell went on
  tolling, and with momentarily increasing rapidity and loudness.</p>

  <p>At this sound, the sentinel posted outside the Grange gave the alarm. In
  another minute the door of the mansion was thrown open, and, a light
  streaming forth, showed the soldiers rushing out.</p>

  <p>Though somewhat taken by surprise, Lord Wilmot and his party promptly
  prepared to act,</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7-1"
     name="ch7-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  How Sargeant Delves Was Reprimanded By His Leader</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WEARIED by his long ride, and by his exertions throughout
  the day, Stelfax, on his return to Ovingdean Grange with the prisoner,
  retired to the chamber he had appropriated, and merely taking off the more
  cumbrous parts of his accoutrements, flung himself on the couch. He was
  buried in profound slumber, when the knocking of the butt-end of a carabine
  at the door roused him, causing him to spring up instantly and seize his
  arms. Clapping his steel cap on his head, but without tarrying to buckle on
  his corslet and leg-pieces, he marched to the door, and, unfastening it,
  found Mattathias outside, who acquainted him with the strange ringing of the
  church bell. Indeed, the sound could be plainly distinguished where they
  were, though the room was at the back of the house.</p>

  <p>Stelfax was not so much alarmed as his subordinate, for it did not occur
  to him as possible that Delves could be the dupe of a stratagem. Something,
  however, was wrong, and must be promptly rectified. He therefore hurried
  downstairs, with the intention of repairing to the church, but, on gaining
  the entrance-hall, found it invaded by a tumultuous assemblage of the
  household, who had flocked thither on hearing the bell toll, and two or three
  minutes were spent in their dispersion. But this being accomplished, he left
  a small guard in the hall, as well to watch over the prisoner, who was
  confined in a little room adjacent to the library, as to keep the household
  in order, and then went forth with the rest of his troop.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a trumpet had more than once been sounded outside to recall the
  men supposed to be gone to the stables; but no notice was taken of the
  summons. When informed of this circumstance, Stelfax was exceedingly wroth,
  and dispatched Nathan Guestling to the stables, commanding the instant return
  of the offenders. A further interruption to his progress occurred at the
  gate. A posse of villagers, only partially attired, and armed with such
  weapons as came readiest to hand, was here congregated, anxious to learn the
  cause of the disturbance. Distrusting these hinds, Stelfax peremptorily
  ordered them to return to their dwellings, threatening to fire upon them if
  they hesitated to comply. Intimidated by the menace, the poor fellows
  retired, while the Ironside captain and his men pursued their way to the
  church. The torches having been left burning by the fugitive Royalists when
  they quitted their temporary prison, the light of the flambeaux was dimly
  distinguishable through the windows as Stelfax passed through the churchyard;
  but nothing, as yet, had occurred to rouse his suspicions. His surprise and
  rage, however, may be conceived when his thundering knock at the church door,
  which he found looked, remained unanswered. Violently shaking the door, he
  endeavoured by main strength to burst it open, and, aided by his men, he
  speedily accomplished his object. A scene then lay before him so startling
  and extraordinary, that he could scarcely believe in its reality.</p>

  <p>His astonishment and stupefaction, however, soon gave way to fury.
  Snatching a torch, he threw its light upon the prostrate forms of Delves and
  Besadaiah, and then commanded that the handkerchiefs should be taken from
  their mouths, but that the cords with which they were bound should not be
  unloosed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is this, sergeant?&rdquo; he demanded in a severe voice, as the
  order was obeyed. &ldquo;How comes it that I find thee thus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Delves gave utterance to a groan, but made no other reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How hast thou fulfilled thine office?&rdquo; continued Stelfax,
  with increased severity. &ldquo;Where are the captives committed to thy
  charge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gone, captain&mdash;all gone!&rdquo; groaned Delves, in a tone of
  deep contrition. &ldquo;They have escaped from me. I will not attempt to
  extenuate my conduct. I have been guilty of gross neglect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soh! thou dost confess it!&mdash;ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax, with
  concentrated fury. &ldquo;Negligent and disobedient dog, thou deservest that
  I should pistol thee without grace allowed for prayer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dispatch me, captain, without pity,&rdquo; the sergeant rejoined.
  &ldquo;I deserve to die. You cannot be more angered with me than I am with
  myself. Were I to live a hundred years, instead of only so many seconds, I
  should never regain my own good opinion. To think that I, who have been
  signalled out for public commendation by the Lord General himself&mdash;who
  have been deemed worthy of your confidence, captain&mdash;who prided myself
  upon strictness of discipline, and blind obedience to the orders of my
  superior, that I should have failed on all points!&mdash;it is too
  much&mdash;it is more than I can bear. Place your pistol at my head, and
  finish me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax; &ldquo;I will not forestal the
  provost-marshal&rsquo;s office. Grievously am I disappointed in thee, O
  Deodatus Delves!&mdash;shamefully hast thou betrayed thy trust! But how came
  the matter to pass? It passeth my comprehension to understand how thou and
  thy comrades could be overcome and bound by so few. Ye would almost seem to
  have proffered your limbs to the fetters of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our prisoners had a subtle demon to aid them, captain,&rdquo;
  replied Delves. &ldquo;Strong waters were treacherously introduced with the
  provisions from the house, and robbed the men of their senses, so that they
  were no longer under my control. I say not this in my own defence, but in
  explanation. The truth will appear upon inquiry, if I be brought before a
  court-martial.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didst thou not snatch the mischievous drink from the besotted
  fools?&rdquo; demanded Stelfax.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alack, captain, all my efforts were unavailing. They resisted, and
  would not be bidden. But this was only part of a scheme, which I believe to
  have been devised by the Independent minister, Increase Micklegift. Men were
  hidden within the church, who came forth suddenly to aid in liberating the
  captives.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All this shows how culpably negligent hath been thy conduct,&rdquo;
  said Stelfax. &ldquo;A notable example will be made of thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reproach me no more, captain,&rdquo; cried Delves. &ldquo;Your
  words are not needed to sharpen the stings of my own conscience. Oh! if I be
  not discarded from the service, no departure from duty shall ever again be
  laid to my charge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Misconduct like thine cannot be lightly passed over, I tell
  thee,&rdquo; returned Stelfax, somewhat appeased, though not choosing to let
  it appear that he was so. &ldquo;Thou hast suffered a prisoner of great
  importance to escape from thee. Thou wert made responsible&mdash;body for
  body&mdash;for the security of the Lord Wilmot, who was committed to thy
  charge. How wilt thou answer for his evasion?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even as you yourself have said, captain, with mine own body,&rdquo;
  the sergeant returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to! dolt. Think&rsquo;st thou thy worthless carcase, or those of
  all thy mutinous comrades, will weigh with the Lord General against the head
  of this malignant nobleman? A great prize has been lost through thy
  negligence. I have hunted down Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s companion, and brought him
  back captive, and thou mayst guess how it would have gladdened our general to
  receive the twain from my hands. Thou thyself wouldst have been advanced in
  his favour. I make little account of young Maunsel and the others, but the
  Lord Wilmot is a great loss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But may he not be recaptured?&rdquo; said Delves. &ldquo;Release me
  from these bonds, and I will not rest till I bring him back to you, dead or
  alive. Fear nothing! I have no desire to escape punishment, but am wishful to
  repair the mischief I have done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be it so, then,&rdquo; said Stelfax, after a moment&rsquo;s
  reflection. &ldquo;I will give thee a chance of redeeming thy errors. Untie
  those cords, and set him free,&rdquo; he added, to the men near him.</p>

  <p>The order was instantly obeyed, and the like grace was accorded to
  Besadaiah, who humbled himself, as the sergeant had done, promising better
  conduct in future.</p>

  <p>Long before this, the troopers shut up in the tower had been let out, but
  they kept aloof, as long as they could, from their incensed leader. How the
  church bell had been rung was then explained. One of their number, aided by
  his comrades, who lifted him on their shoulders, after the manner practised
  by professional tumblers, had contrived to catch hold of the bell-rope, which
  had been tied up at a point supposed to be out of reach. The bell was then
  tolled without difficulty. The Ironside leader&rsquo;s anger being by this
  time considerably abated, he contented himself with sharply reprimanding all
  the minor culprits. But the state in which Helpless Henly and the two other
  drunken troopers were found did not admit of their conduct being passed over
  so lightly. Causing the bandages to be removed from their mouths, but not
  suffering the cords with which they were bound to be taken off, their leader
  left them in this state to sleep off the effects of their drunken revel.
  While mustering the men, it suddenly occurred to him to inquire from Delves
  whom he had sent to the stables.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have sent no one,&rdquo; the sergeant replied. &ldquo;If any have
  gone thither, it must be the cunning malignants who carried off our weapons
  and accoutrements.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art right!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax. &ldquo;Fool that I was,
  not to perceive this sooner! These men were seen and challenged by the
  sentinel, who took them for comrades because they were accoutred like us, and
  gave the watchword. Let us to the stables at once&mdash;though I fear the
  birds are flown. In that case we must scour the country for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon which he rushed out of the church, followed by his men.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7-2"
     name="ch7-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  In What Manner Colonel Gunter Was Liberated</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No notice, as we have shown, was taken by Lord Wilmot and
  the little party under his command of the trumpeter&rsquo;s summons; but as
  it was almost certain that a messenger would speedily be sent to order their
  return, preparations were made for his reception. For this purpose, John
  Habergeon and the elder Saxby dismounted and entered the stable; and as soon
  as Nathan Guestling arrived there, the door was closed upon him, and, being
  seized by these two powerful men, he was thrown down bound hand and foot with
  a halter, and almost stifled with a horse-cloth wrapped round his face.</p>

  <p>This task accomplished, the pair issued from the stables, and found that,
  in the interim, Lord Wilmot had sent the horses, in charge of the grooms, to
  a particular spot at the back of the garden indicated by Ninian. Stelfax had
  been sent to go to the church with a party of men, and the house being left
  comparatively undefended, his lordship apprehended little resistance, and
  ordered his party to set forward at once.</p>

  <p>As they approached the mansion, the sentinel called out to them,
  &ldquo;How now, comrades! Are ye come at last? Wherefore did ye not answer
  the recall? Did ye not hear the alarm-bell rung from the church?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Question us not&mdash;we are in haste,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot hastily
  replied, pressing on with the others. &ldquo;Come with me inside, and thou
  shalt hear that which will surprise thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What hath happened?&rdquo; demanded the man, preceding them into
  the house. But scarcely had he crossed the threshold than the Royalists
  closed round him and disarmed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Utter but a cry,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot, clapping a pistol close
  to his head, &ldquo;and it will be thy last. Thou art wholly in our power.
  But do as I bid thee, and thy life shall be spared. Dost heed me,
  knave?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man made no reply, but did not attempt to give the alarm.</p>

  <p>At the moment when the Royalists thus gained admittance to the hall it was
  empty. On a table at one side a lamp was burning, but Ninian quickly
  extinguished it, and plunged the place in darkness. Just as this was
  accomplished, the door of a room adjoining the library was opened, and a
  harsh voice demanded who was there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do thou answer,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot to the sentinel, still
  holding the mouth of the pistol to his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis I&mdash;Gabriel Flint,&rdquo; responded the
  sentinel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! what dost thou there, Gabriel?&rdquo; inquired the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak as I enjoin thee,&rdquo; muttered Lord Wilmot, breathing a
  few words in his ear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The captain hath sent a file of men for the prisoner,&rdquo; said
  Flint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, bring him forth without delay,&rdquo; added John Habergeon, in
  a snuffling, puritanical voice. &ldquo;We are to take him to his friends at
  the church.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye shall have him, and welcome,&rdquo; replied the other.
  &ldquo;But tell me, comrade, what was the meaning of that ringing of the
  church bell?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a mere trick of the prisoners,&rdquo; responded John;
  &ldquo;they had barricaded the door of the tower wherein they were confined,
  and I suppose contrived to clamber up the walls and reach the bell-rope. The
  noise is checked now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, our captain would soon put a stop to such vagaries, I&rsquo;ll
  warrant him,&rdquo; responded the trooper. &ldquo;Come forth,
  prisoner,&rdquo; he added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither would ye take me?&rdquo; demanded Colonel Gunter, as he
  approached the door of the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To your friends,&rdquo; replied the trooper, in a jeering tone.
  &ldquo;They are anxious for your company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot answered, &ldquo;Be quick!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Colonel Gunter fancied he recognized the voice, and accelerated his
  movements.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here is the prisoner,&rdquo; said the trooper, pushing the colonel
  forth&mdash;&ldquo;take him! But the lamp has gone out, I perceive. I will
  bring a light instantly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is needless,&rdquo; John Habergeon replied. &ldquo;We care not
  to behold the Amalekite&rsquo;s features. We will take thy word that it is
  the right man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While this brief colloquy occurred, Lord Wilmot grasped the
  colonel&rsquo;s arm, and made his presence known to him in a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You here, my good lord, and in that garb?&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel
  Gunter, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;We are all
  friends&mdash;except this rascal, whose brains I will blow out if he venture
  to utter a word. Mve on with the prisoner!&mdash;to the church!&rdquo; he
  added, aloud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so fast, comrades!&mdash;not so fast! A word with you ere you
  depart!&rdquo; cried the trooper, appearing at the door with a light.</p>

  <p>All chance of concealment was then at an end.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! what is this?&rdquo; cried the trooper. &ldquo;Malignants in
  the garb of soldiers of the Republic. Where are ye, comrades?
  Treason!&mdash;help!&mdash;succour!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he discharged his pistol at the retreating Royalists. The
  ball passed within an inch of Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s head, but fortunately
  missed him.</p>

  <p>John Habergeon and Ninian Saxby fired at the trooper in return, but as the
  latter had instantly retreated into the room, no damage was done him.
  Prohibiting any continuance of the conflict, Lord Wilmot ordered his party to
  move on. He still kept hold of the sentinel, intending to release him at the
  door. But, ere the Royalists could pass forth, they were again delayed in an
  unexpected manner. The discharge of fire-arms operated as a signal to another
  set of persons who had been secretly meditating an attack upon the
  Roundheads, and who now found that their design had been anticipated. From
  the passage leading to the buttery and kitchen flocked some half-dozen or
  more of the household, headed by Giles Moppett and Crundy, and armed with
  partisans and bills. At the same time, Colonel Maunsel, sword in hand,
  appeared at the head of the staircase, closely attended by Martin Geere, with
  a musket over his shoulder, while a few paces behind them were Mr. Beard and
  Dulcia, with Patty Whinchat.</p>

  <p>It will now be proper to explain how all these persons chanced to appear
  with so much suddenness. As may be supposed, on that eventful night none of
  the inmates of the Grange retired to rest; and consequently they were all
  aware that Stelfax had returned with a new prisoner. Though entertaining no
  hope whatever of accomplishing his son&rsquo;s and Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s
  deliverance from their enemies, Colonel Maunsel did not entirely despair of
  setting free the captive last brought in. Who this personage might be the old
  Cavalier was entirely ignorant. All the household were firmly persuaded it
  was the king; and though Colonel Maunsel, who had received an assurance to
  the contrary from Lord Wilmot, did not share in their belief, still he felt
  certain the individual must be a Royalist of distinction&mdash;and, in all
  probability, a friend. An effort must, therefore, be made for his liberation.
  Through the agency of Martin Geere and Giles Moppett, who were employed by
  the colonel in preparation for this project, the whole of the household were
  secretly armed, and commanded to hold themselves in readiness, in case the
  attempt could be made with any prospect of success. So long as the Ironsides
  maintained an imposing force, and, indeed, outnumbered the colonel&rsquo;s
  retainers, any such attempt would have been fraught with the greatest risk;
  but when Stelfax set off to the church, taking half a dozen men with him, and
  leaving but a slender guard of three or four behind&mdash;of which Colonel
  Maunsel was made aware by Moppett&mdash;then it seemed to the old Cavalier
  that the right moment had arrived. But Moppett had a plan of his own for
  rendering the matter quite certain. With the aid of his fellow-servants, he
  undertook to secure three of the Ironsides in the cellar, whither he knew
  they were about to go, and besought his master to wait till he could carry
  the plan into effect. Though anxious for the onset, Colonel Maunsel agreed to
  the delay&mdash;or rather, allowed himself to be persuaded by Mr. Beard to
  adopt this prudent course. The good clergyman and his daughter had remained
  with the colonel to a late hour, and finding it was his intention to watch
  throughout the night, Mr. Beard desired permission to keep him company, and
  of course the request could not be refused. Dulcia was unwilling to leave her
  father&mdash;and Patty did not like to quit her young mistress&mdash;so they
  all remained in an upper room, which Colonel Maunsel had chosen for himself
  when driven from his own chamber by Stelfax. Within this room the colonel was
  pacing to and fro, supported by Martin Geere, scarcely able to control his
  impatience, and eagerly expecting Moppett&rsquo;s appearance, when the report
  of a pistol, almost instantly followed by two other shots, suddenly smote his
  ears. Drawing his sword, he hastened, without support, along the corridor to
  the head of the stairs, followed somewhat more cautiously by the others.</p>

  <p>Patty Whinchat had snatched up a taper before quitting the room, and
  others of the household, when issuing from the buttery and kitchen, had
  brought lamps with them, so there was now light enough to reveal the
  disguised Royalists near the door. Deceived by their accoutrements, the old
  Cavalier took them for Parliamentary soldiers, and naturally concluded they
  were marching off with the prisoner. But his blood was now up, and although
  Mr. Beard besought him not to interfere and so jeopardize his own safety, he
  shouted out to the supposed Roundheads to set free their prisoner instantly.
  Then turning to his household, he vociferated,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon them, my men!&mdash;upon them!&mdash;strike hard, and fear
  not!&mdash;I will be down with you on the instant, and will show you how such
  crop-eared curs ought to be dealt with. Upon them, I say! Wherefore do you
  hesitate?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They do well to hesitate in attacking friends and supporters of the
  good cause, Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo; cried Lord Wilmot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Royalists in the garb of rebels!&rdquo; exclaimed the old
  Cavalier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, Royalists!&rdquo; cried Clavering. &ldquo;If you do not
  recognize Lord Wilmot, surely my voice cannot be strange to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Methinks your honour will recognize mine?&rdquo; John Habergeon
  called out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And mine also, I am assured?&rdquo; Ninian added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know you all now,&rdquo; cried the colonel, who had been for a
  moment speechless with astonishment. &ldquo;Come to my arms, my dear boy,
  that I may embrace thee once more!&rdquo; he added, hurrying down the
  staircase in a delirium of joy, while Clavering sprang forward to meet him.
  &ldquo;Art thou indeed free?&rdquo; he cried, catching the young man in his
  arms, and folding him to his breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Free as yourself, father,&rdquo; Clavering rejoined. &ldquo;We have
  left those caitiff Roundheads in our places in the church.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amazement!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel. &ldquo;This passes all my
  comprehension.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your honour would be still more amazed if you could hear how it has
  been accomplished,&rdquo; John Habergeon remarked; &ldquo;but there is not
  time to tell it now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While this was going on, the trooper who had kept guard over Colonel
  Gunter had been attacked by a strong body of the household, and was now
  dragged forth by them in triumph, with his arms pinioned with his own belt.
  Seeing this, Lord Wilmot consigned the sentinel to Moppet and Crundy, bidding
  them take both rascals away, and shoot them if they thought proper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, we will not put them to death,&rdquo; said Moppett, &ldquo;but
  we will clap them with their comrades in the cellar.&rdquo; And both
  prisoners were haled away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must perforce tear your son from your embraces, Colonel
  Maunsel,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;We shall have the Ironsides back
  from the church, and then all our trouble will be lost. We came here to
  liberate a brother Royalist&mdash;Colonel Gunter of Racton,&rdquo; he added,
  in a low voice, to the old Cavalier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Maunsel, warmly grasping the hand of
  the newly- liberated prisoner. &ldquo;I knew him not, but was about to make
  an effort for his liberation. However, you have got the start of me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I thank you as heartily, Colonel Maunsel, as if you
  had been first to help me,&rdquo; said Colonel Gunter. And he then added, in
  a low tone, &ldquo;We came to consult with you about procuring a vessel,
  either at Newhaven or Shoreham, to convey his Majesty to France.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A word, ere I answer you!&rdquo; exclaimed the old Cavalier,
  eagerly. &ldquo;You can assure me, I trust, that his Majesty is in
  safety?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have every reason to believe so,&rdquo; replied Gunter.
  &ldquo;Lord Wilmot left him at Boscobel in the care of loyal liegemen, who
  will guard him with their life&mdash;as you would guard him, colonel. But how
  think you? Can a vessel be procured?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt it not,&rdquo; said the old Cavalier. &ldquo;There is a
  skipper of Shoreham, named Nicholas Tattersall, who is master of a
  fast-sailing brig, called the Swiftsure. I know him to be an honest fellow,
  who may be trusted in such an enterprise; but, unluckily, he is away at
  present&mdash;at Plymouth, I believe&mdash;and his return is
  uncertain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nicholas Tattersall! I shall not forget the name, colonel,&rdquo;
  replied Gunter. &ldquo;If his Majesty should not otherwise be provided,
  Tattersall shall be our man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If we ourselves do not depart at once we shall have small chance of
  lending his Majesty further aid,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;Will you not
  go with us, Colonel Maunsel? If you stay, you will have to brook the
  rage&mdash;perhaps the vengeance&mdash;of that disappointed and savage
  Ironside captain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear him not,&rdquo; replied the old Cavalier. &ldquo;I will not
  quit my house, unless forced from it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Despite the hurry and confusion of the moment, it will not be supposed
  that Clavering&mdash;aware of her presence&mdash;would fail to seek out
  Dulcia. When his father became engaged with Colonel Gunter he instantly took
  advantage of the opportunity offered him to fly to her. The poor damsel
  needed his support. The sudden revulsion of feeling she experienced was too
  much for her. Her lover&rsquo;s fate had appeared to her to be sealed. Escape
  for him from the clutches of Stelfax seemed impossible. Yet at the very
  moment when such an occurrence was least expected, he stood before
  her&mdash;free! Yes, free! The garb in which he was arrayed told how he had
  escaped. But explanation was unneeded. Enough for her he was out of the power
  of his relentless captor, who had pronounced that his doom would be death.
  After gazing at him for a short space intently, through eyes streaming with
  tears, she gave utterance to a wild, irrepressible cry of delight, which had
  yet something thrilling and painful about it, and sank upon his shoulder. Mr.
  Beard, who was standing beside his daughter, watching her with great anxiety,
  would have removed her, but Clavering besought him to forbear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave her with me for a moment, good sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
  time is short. Heaven only knows when we shall meet again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Place yourself wholly in the hands of Providence, my dear young
  friend,&rdquo; the clergyman rejoined. &ldquo;After this display of His mercy
  manifested towards you, you can never doubt His ability to aid you, if He be
  so minded. Resign yourself, henceforth, to His will and guidance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My heart is full to overflowing with gratitude to the Great
  Disposer of Events,&rdquo; said Clavering; &ldquo;but He would not have us
  remain inactive. As He prompts, we must obey. If I might counsel you, I would
  urge you to fly for a season with Dulcia from this dwelling, and seek a more
  secure asylum elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither should I go?&rdquo; Mr. Beard replied. &ldquo;There is no
  place of security for me and for my child. No, I will not voluntarily quit
  the house that has sheltered me so long. I will not desert the patron who has
  so long befriended me, and who has need of my ministry and assistance. And my
  child will tarry with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the last, father,&rdquo; Dulcia cried, raising her head.
  &ldquo;My place is near your side, and I will never abandon it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would not have you do so!&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering. &ldquo;But
  it drives me almost to distraction to think what may happen when that fierce
  Republican officer returns. I cannot&mdash;will not leave you.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must&mdash;you must, dear Clavering,&rdquo; said Dulcia.
  &ldquo;Fly with your friends, and think not of us, or think that we are under
  the protection of a watchful Providence. Your staying here would not add to
  our security, and would lead to your own certain recapture. Go!&mdash;go with
  my father&rsquo;s blessing, and my own heartfelt wishes for your
  preservation. Stay not a moment longer. Pray Heaven you have not stayed too
  long already!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This latter exclamation was caused by a movement of alarm among the
  Royalists. A noise was heard outside, announcing the return of Stelfax and
  his men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are upon us!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;Secure the
  door, and extinguish the lights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The latter order was instantly obeyed, and the first part of the
  directions was attended to with equal promptitude by John Habergeon and
  Ninian, who, flying to the door, bolted and barred it.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding further, we may mention that Ninian had found
  Patty&rsquo;s presence as irresistible as that of Dulcia proved to his young
  master. Marching up to her in military fashion, but with rather more swagger
  in his gait than was consistent with his Roundhead accoutrements, he tried to
  catch her in his arms. Patty either did not recognize him at first in his
  disguise, or pretended not to do so, for she screamed slightly, and checked
  his attempted familiarity by a sound box on the ear. However, an explanation
  quickly ensued, and she was congratulating him on his escape, when the alarm
  of Stelfax&rsquo;s return was given as above narrated, and the young falconer
  suddenly recalled to sterner duties.</p>

  <p>The door, which was of oak and of considerable strength, possessing,
  moreover, ponderous bolts and bars, was only just barricaded in time. The
  next moment it was forcibly tried, and the voice of Stelfax was heard
  furiously demanding admittance. The windows in front of the old mansion were
  deeply embayed, and projected far beyond the walls. They were built of stone,
  with massive upright posts and transverse bars; and the divisions between the
  bars were secured by iron stanchions, so that, although only curtains were
  drawn inside no danger of unlicensed entrance into the house was to be
  apprehended. Finding the door solid enough to resist all his efforts to burst
  it open, Stelfax turned his attention to the windows lighting the hall, and
  which were at no great height from the ground. But here, again, he was
  disappointed, as was shown by his exclamations, which, being uttered in a
  loud key, were quite audible to those inside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are here,&rdquo; cried the Ironside captain. &ldquo;I am well
  assured of it. What ho! within,&rdquo; he vociferated. &ldquo;I summon you to
  surrender in the name of the Republic. Ye will be put to death if you
  resist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Away with you upstairs!&rdquo; cried Colonel Maunsel to Mr. Beard
  and the women. &ldquo;Get out of harm&rsquo;s way as quickly as you can. We
  shall have hot work presently. Take care of yourselves, and find some
  shelter,&rdquo; he added to the others. &ldquo;They are about to fire upon
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus cautioned, such members of the household as were left in the hall
  beat a hasty retreat into the passage leading to the buttery; Dulcia and
  Patty skipped up the great staircase, followed more leisurely by Mr. Beard,
  who deemed it inconsistent with his calling to display haste even at a moment
  of danger; while the others stepped quickly into the banqueting-room, the
  door of which was open. The next moment a loud explosion was heard. A volley
  of shot was poured against one of the windows, shivering the beautiful
  stained glass within it, while several of the bullets struck against the foot
  of the grand staircase. Luckily, no further damage was done.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now make for your horses with all possible dispatch,&rdquo; cried
  Colonel Maunsel to Lord Wilmot and the others. &ldquo;These knaves will go to
  the back of the house next, and try to cut off you retreat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On my soul, I am half inclined to stay and give them battle,&rdquo;
  Lord Wilmot said. &ldquo;We are equal to them in numbers, I think, without
  counting your servants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My servants must not be counted, my lord,&rdquo; the old Cavalier
  replied. &ldquo;They would go for nothing in a conflict of this kind, but,
  however disposed you may be for an engagement with the rascals, I would beg
  of you to depart. You owe it to his Majesty to care for your own
  safety.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot replied. &ldquo;And it decides me
  to shun an encounter with them, if it can be helped. But will you not go with
  us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; Colonel Maunsel replied, firmly. &ldquo;My
  place is here. To your horses as fast as you can! Heaven grant these
  Roundheads reach not the back of the house ere you get out. Ninian will show
  you the way. If you have no other place of refuge, go to the Star at
  Alfriston, where you are certain to find shelter. John Habergeon knows the
  house well. Adieu, my dear lord!&mdash;and adieu to all!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On this the Royalist hurried across the hall, and, guided by Ninian,
  tracked the passage leading to the buttery, and made for the outlet at the
  rear of the house. Clavering lingered behind for a moment to receive his
  father&rsquo;s blessing, and then speeded after the others.</p>

  <p>A walled enclosure, possessing two or three outlets leading to different
  parts of the premises, protected the back part of the mansion. The nearest
  way to the spot where the horses were stationed lay through the farm-yard,
  but if this course had been taken, the fugitive Royalists must at once have
  encountered the enemy, and Ninian therefore led them by a roundabout course
  through the garden, with which one of the doors in the yard communicated.</p>

  <p>We have stated that Clavering was the last to come forth, and ere he
  stepped into the yard, all the others had crossed it and passed into the
  garden, with the single exception of John Habergeon. The old trooper waited
  for his young master, and it was well he did so. While Clavering was hurrying
  towards the outlet which John held open for him, urging him to look quick,
  for the red- coats were at hand (as was, indeed, evident by the noise), a
  door on the opposite side of the yard was burst open, and in rushed Stelfax
  and his men. Though the place was obscure, the light of the moon betrayed
  Clavering to his foes, and the infuriated Roundhead leader made a bound
  towards him like that of a tiger.</p>

  <p>But he was balked of his prey, just when he fancied he had it in his
  grasp. Clavering succeeded in passing through the door, which was clapped to
  in the face of his pursuer by John Habergoen. The door could be bolted on the
  inner side, but on the outer, or garden side, there was only an iron handle
  connected with the latch. Seizing this handle, John urged his young master to
  fly, telling him he could hold the door for a minute or two, and then should
  be able to take care of himself. The old trooper&rsquo;s tone of
  determination was not to be mistaken, so Clavering flew across the garden in
  the direction taken by the other fugitives.</p>

  <p>Meantime, Stelfax tugged with all his might against the door, but John
  maintained it firmly against him, until, hearing the other prepare to fire at
  him through the boards, he deemed it prudent to let go, and decamped just in
  time to avoid the lodgement of a bullet in his body. Speeding with the
  swiftness of lightning across the grass-plot, he tried to gain the screen of
  the yew-tree avenue. But ere he got half way to it, the Ironsides were out
  and after him. Several shots were fired at him, and one or two of them must
  have checked his career, if he had not been provided with steel cap and
  back-piece, both of which were bullet-proof. As it was, he got off unscathed,
  and, passing through a gate, reached the little thicket at the back of the
  garden.</p>

  <p>The report of the fire-arms had alarmed his friends; all of whom,
  Clavering included, had reached their horses, and were already in the saddle.
  Guessing what had happened, and fearing John might be shot or captured, yet
  anxious to lend him aid, they rode towards the garden gate, and had the
  satisfaction to see him issue from it unhurt. The old trooper shouted for joy
  at the sight of his friends, and in another instant was on the back of the
  steed, the bridle of which was held for him by Ninian. Hardly was this
  accomplished, when Stelfax and his men appeared.</p>

  <p>On beholding the foe, Lord Wilmot drew his sword, and calling upon his
  companions to follow him, charged the Roundheads, resolved to hew them down.
  But the Ironside leader did not care to abide the attack. His own pistols and
  the carabines of his men had been discharged, and time had not been allowed
  them to reload. He therefore gave the word to retreat into the garden, and
  the command was promptly obeyed. Satisfied with this success, and not caring
  to continue the struggle, the Royalists contented themselves with a loud
  triumphant shout that made the holt ring again, and rode off.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7-3"
     name="ch7-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  The Night Ride To Newhaven&mdash;The Brig And The Frigate</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LORD WILMOT determined to act upon Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s
  suggestion, and seek an asylum at the Star at Alfriston; and both Colonel
  Gunter and Clavering approved of the plan. John Habergeon undertook to get
  them secretly into the house. To reach Alfriston, they must proceed by
  Newhaven; for, although the former village lay a few miles to the south-east
  of the little seaport at the mouth of the Ouse, the river had to be crossed,
  and this could only be accomplished either by the ferry at Newhaven or the
  bridge at Lewes. Towards Newhaven, therefore, they directed their course.</p>

  <p>The night was clear and calm, and a crescent moon hung like a lamp in the
  deep starlit vault. It was about the second hour after midnight, and had any
  one seen the troop careering over the downs at that lonesome time, they might
  have been judged to be bent on some dark design. But to newly-escaped
  captives, as they all were, the sense of freedom was inexpressibly
  delightful. It being a principle with the Cavaliers to banish care, and make
  the most of the passing moment, they all appeared in good spirits. The
  fineness of the night, the fresh air, and the pleasant and wholesome exercise
  so exhilarated them, that Lord Wilmot and Colonel Gunter soon became quite
  cheerful, and even Clavering shook off his misgivings.</p>

  <p>Pursuing their way, in the first instance, along the undulating ridge of
  the hill trending towards the coast, they passed an ancient barrow, and a
  fire- beacon contiguous to it, which latter occupied the site of the present
  windmill, until they came to the Newhaven road, skirting which, and keeping
  on the turf, they descended the gentle declivity dipping into
  Rottingdean.</p>

  <p>And here we may, parenthetically, remark, that no more delightful ride or
  walk can be found in any part of the kingdom than is to be had by following
  the line of coast between Brighton and Newhaven. Fine turf, which need never
  be quitted, is to be found the whole way. A little to the west of Rottingdean
  the cliffs form a natural terrace carpeted with sod as smooth as velvet,
  redolent of wild thyme and other fragrant herbs, and commanding splendid
  sea-views; but, indeed, nearly the same thing may be said of eight miles out
  of the nine. The elasticity of the turf, and the freshness of the breeze,
  make exercise taken under such circumstances a delightful recreation.</p>

  <p>Rottingdean, a village of some antiquity, was then nearly as large as it
  is at the present time. A few little tenements, occupied by fishermen, were
  built near the shore, but the better sort of habitations lay further up the
  valley, near the church. Three or four broad-bottomed boats were hauled up,
  high and dry, on the shingly beach, but there were no other evidences of any
  maritime calling on the part of the inhabitants. The whole village seemed
  fast asleep. Not a dog barked as the Royalists rode past the cottages, and
  mounted the opposite hill.</p>

  <p>At that time the Sussex roads were accounted among the worst in England,
  and as the best were bad enough, their condition may be surmised. The ascents
  were excessively steep, and the descents proportionately dangerous. The ruts
  were tremendous; and in bad weather, or after the breaking up of a frost, the
  chalky mud was so thick, slab, and tenacious, that carts and other vehicles
  often stuck fast in it, and could with difficulty be extricated. The coast
  road nigh which our Royalists rode was as indifferent as any in the county,
  but the turf on either side of it was exquisite&mdash;fine as a well-kept
  bowling-green.</p>

  <p>On gaining the brow of the hill on the further side of Rottingdean, Lord
  Wilmot allowed his gaze to range over the sea, a wide expanse of which here
  lay before him. A pleasant breeze was blowing from the south-east. In the
  deep stillness of the night the waves could be distinctly heard dashing upon
  the shore, and rattling amongst the shingles. The beams of the moon fell in a
  line of quivering light athwart the waves, tipping their edges with silver,
  and within this line a small brig could be discerned, shaping her course
  towards the south, as if about to cross the Channel. As he watched this
  little vessel cleaving her way through the glittering waters, Lord Wilmot
  could not help exclaiming aloud, &ldquo;Yon brig seems bound for the opposite
  shore. Would that the object of our greatest solicitude were on board
  her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case, we might say that all our anxiety was ended,&rdquo;
  cried Colonel Gunter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Clavering, &ldquo;for if I mistake not, there
  is a frigate cruising out yonder, opposite Newhaven, which will speedily
  compel the little sloop to haul to, so that if his Majesty were on board of
  the latter vessel he would inevitably be captured.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Heaven, you are right!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Wilmot.
  &ldquo;Rebels swarm upon the waters as they do on the land. These shores are
  so jealously watched, that escape seems barely possible. See! a gun is fired
  by the frigate as a signal to the brig to stay her course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a flash was visible from the side of the more distant vessel,
  followed soon afterwards by a loud report. The sloop instantly lowered her
  sails in obedience to the summons to stay, and floated listlessly upon the
  waves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope no Royalist is on board that little bark,&rdquo; exclaimed
  Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;If so, he will soon be in the hands of the enemy, for
  see! a boat is lowered from the frigate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Royalists paused to look on. In another minute the boat was manned,
  and propelled with lusty strokes by a dozen well-armed seamen, accompanied by
  an officer seated in the stern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There they go, in evident expectation of making a prize,&rdquo;
  cried Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;Let us hope the rascals may be disappointed. But as
  we can render no assistance to the good cause, but may jeopardize our own
  safety by needless delay, we had best move on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have here a proof of the great hazard his Majesty will incur by
  attempting this means of escape,&rdquo; Clavering observed to Lord Wilmot.
  &ldquo;Does not the incident excite your lordship&rsquo;s
  apprehensions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The risk will be great, undoubtedly,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot replied;
  &ldquo;but it must be run. The king is exposed to greater perils on shore. A
  fast-sailing sloop and a good captain are what we need; and these requisites
  are to be found, according to your father, in the Swiftsure, commanded by
  Captain Nicholas Tattersall, of Shoreham.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know Captain Tattersall. He is a good seaman, and a trusty
  fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unluckily, he is absent just now,&rdquo; Lord Wilmot replied;
  &ldquo;but if circumstances comple us to wait, we will have recourse to
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Having mounted two or three eminences, and descended into as many hollows,
  the party now reached a flat upland covered with gorse and brambles, and soon
  afterwards the road, instead of continuing along the summits of the cliffs,
  turned off on the left in a rapid descent towards Newhaven, which was only
  about a mile distant. From this point, had there been light enough, the
  greater part of the Lewes levels, with the noble downs beyond them, would
  have been visible, but the distant landscape was buried in obscurity,
  increased by vapours arising from the broad swampy tract below. About half a
  mile off, on a headland overlooking the quay of New-haven, and known as the
  Castle Hill, stood another fire-beacon. Rising rapidly down the hill, and
  passing the old church, amidst its trees, on the right, the fugitives dashed
  through the town to the ferry.</p>

  <p>Though of no great width, the Ouse has a channel of considerable depth,
  and the tide, which runs up higher than Lewes, being confined within narrow
  banks, rises with great rapidity, and ebbs with equal speed. At the present
  day the river is crossed by a drawbridge, but at the time of our story the
  only means of transit was by the ferry in question. When the cavalcade
  reached the bank, they easily discovered the large flat-bottomed, punt-shaped
  boat, used for the conveyance of men and cattle across the stream, with its
  huge oars and poles inside it. But it was chained fast to a post on the hard,
  and no ferryman was there to set it free or undertake its conduct across the
  river. Our Royalists, however, were not men to be easily checked. With the
  aid of a stone, John Habergeon soon broke off the staple that held the chain,
  and he and Eustace Saxby undertook to perform the part of ferrymen. Three of
  the horses&mdash;all that the boat would hold at a time securely&mdash;were
  embarked; and these, with the three Cavaliers, having been transported to the
  other side, the self-constituted boatmen returned for the rest of the horses,
  which had been left in charge of Ninian. These also, together with the young
  falconer, were safely ferried across the Ouse. This done, and horses and men
  being landed, the boat was turned adrift, and borne rapidly by the ebbing
  current towards the sea, John Habergeon observing, with a laugh, &ldquo;If
  those rascally Roundheads should pursue us, they will be brought to a stop
  here, for there is not another ferry-boat or a bridge betwixt Newhaven and
  Lewes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On leaving Newhaven, the fugitives took a northerly course, and for some
  time followed the road leading from Seaford to Denton and Tarring Neville.
  They were now skirting a disused channel of the Ouse, and could hear the
  hollow cry of the bittern booming across the marshy levels. Enveloped in the
  mists arising from this fenny region, they could scarcely see a yard before
  them, and had to proceed with some caution, until, after passing through
  Denton, they struck across the uplands on the right, and soon got clear of
  the fogs. They then made their way, regardless of all impediments, to
  Alfriston, where they arrived long before any of the inhabitants of the
  village were stirring, and proceeded forthwith towards the place of refuge
  recommended by Colonel Maunsel.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7-4"
     name="ch7-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  The &ldquo;Star&rdquo; At Alfriston</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Star at Alfriston, happily still existing, is one of the
  best specimens to be met with of an ancient English hostelry. Dating back as
  far as the early part of the sixteenth century, this curious old building was
  originally designed as a resting-place for pilgrims and mendicant friars, and
  was meant, moreover, to afford sanctuary to such as claimed ecclesiastical
  protection. The woodwork of the ancient hostelry is enriched with quaint and
  grotesque carvings, all of which are imbued with medival character and
  spirit. On either side of the wide-arched portal are saintly figures, and
  under the windows of the door may be seen two snakes with tails entwined. At
  a corner of the structure is a large carved lion, and over it two apes
  sustaining a mace crowned. Near the sign-post there used to be a dog, and
  beside it a bacchanalian figure with bottle and glass&mdash;but these, and
  doubtless many other equally curious memorials of the past, are gone. Within,
  there are other traces of antiquity. On the main beam of the principal room
  is a shield, inscribed with the sacred characters I.H.S.</p>

  <p>How it came to pass at a period like that in which our Tale is laid, when
  all ecclesiastical ornaments were mutilated or destroyed by bigots and
  fanatics, that such decorations as were possessed by the old hostelry of
  Alfriston should have been spared, we pretend not to determine. Such must
  have been the case, since they are still preserved. Perhaps the inhabitants
  of the village were less bigoted than their neighbours, or they may have
  respected the idolatrous carvings of the inn out of regard for the worthy
  host. Honest Stephen Buxted brewed such good ale, sold such good wine, and
  trimmed his sails so dexterously, that he found favour with both factions.
  Secretly, however, his inclinations were for the Royalists, by whom, as we
  have intimated, he was trusted; many fugitive Cavaliers having at various
  times found refuge beneath his roof.</p>

  <p>Dawn was just breaking as the little cavalcade entered Alfriston.
  Slackening their pace, they rode through the village as quietly as they
  could, being anxious not to disturb the slumbers of the inhabitants. The fine
  old cruciform church, with its lofty spire, round which the jackdaws were
  already wheeling, making the welkin ring with their cawing, reared itself
  before them. But neither on this ancient structure, nor on the mutilated
  stone-cross standing in the centre of the street, did the Royalists bestow
  much attention. Their object being to gain secret admittance to the hostelry,
  they did not halt before the front door, but turned down a lane at the side
  of the house, and at once proceeded to the stables. Here John Habergeon, in
  fulfilment of his promise, quickly managed to knock up the ostler, who, as
  soon as he recognized him, came forth and helped to convey their steeds to
  the stalls.</p>

  <p>While this was going on, Stephen Buxted made his appearance at the back
  door of the hostelry, anxious to know what guests had thus unexpectedly
  arrived, but being completely in dishabille, having only just sprung out of
  bed, he did not care to venture forth in the chilly air. Seeing a Republican
  soldier, as he supposed, issue from the stable, honest Stephen was about to
  beat a hasty retreat, and shut the door after him, when Clavering&mdash;for
  he it was who had come forth&mdash;arrested him by calling out, in the
  Cavaliers&rsquo; shibboleth, that he was a friend of Csar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A friend of Csar in the accoutrements of a rebel!&rdquo; muttered
  Buxted. &ldquo;Seek not to impose upon me, good master,&rdquo; he added,
  aloud. &ldquo;Be you whom you may, you cannot enter the house at this
  untimely hour. You must tarry for an hour or two within the stable, and make
  shift with clean straw for a bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, he was again about to retire, when Clavering once more arrested
  him, by calling out, &ldquo;Do you not know me, Buxted?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The voice sounds familiar!&rdquo; cried the host, pausing.
  &ldquo;Surely it cannot be Master Clavering Maunsel, of Ovingdean
  Grange?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have guessed aright, Buxted,&rdquo; the young man replied,
  advancing towards him, so as to afford the host a better view of his
  features; and he then added, in a lower voice, &ldquo;I and some friends have
  come to take shelter with you, and if you can accommodate us, it is possible
  we may remain with you for a few days&mdash;perhaps a week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and your friends shall be welcome, good Master
  Clavering,&rdquo; the host replied. &ldquo;I trust all is well with your
  honoured father. I need scarcely say that the son of Colonel Maunsel shall
  have the best entertainment my poor house affords.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any entertainment will suffice for me, Buxted,&rdquo; Clavering
  rejoined; &ldquo;but there is one with me whose high rank demands more than
  ordinary care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;High rank, said you, Master Clavering?&rdquo; cried the host.
  &ldquo;Surely, it is not our gracious master in person? Oh! if it should be,
  he shall be welcome to all Stephen Buxted possesses!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know your loyalty and devotion, my worthy host,&rdquo; Clavering
  replied. &ldquo;But this is not the king. I would it were! he could not be in
  better hands than yours. But if your sovereign will not lodge with you, you
  will have one of his Majesty&rsquo;s trustiest advisers as your guest. And
  who knows but ere long you may have the king himself beneath your
  roof!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would, indeed, delight me to have an opportunity of testifying
  my loyalty!&rdquo; cried Buxted. &ldquo;But bid your friends come in at once,
  and do not remain out there in the yard. I hope your entrance into the
  village may not have been observed, for we have many curious gossips in
  Alfriston, though they are, for the most part, well affected towards the
  king. I will say that for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So far as I can judge, our arrival has been wholly
  unnoticed,&rdquo; said Clavering. &ldquo;We did not encounter a soul in the
  street, and no one that I observed looked forth at us. But I will now go and
  fetch my friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I will be with them in a moment,&rdquo; the host replied.
  &ldquo;I will but go upstairs and put on a few clothes, that I may attend
  upon them more decorously.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this he disappeared, while Clavering crossed over to the stables, and
  presently returned with the rest of the party, all of whom entered the house.
  As our young friend knew his way to the parlour, he did not wait for the host
  to conduct him thither, but ushered Lord Wilmot and Colonel Gunter into the
  room, where in another minute they were joined by the host, who by this time
  had managed to put on his doublet and hose. To honest Buxted&rsquo;s
  inquiries as to what he could bring them, his guests replied that what they
  needed most was rest. Accordingly, he led them at once to sleeping
  apartments, of which there were, luckily, several unoccupied in the house,
  and he undertook to hide their martial accoutrements, as soon as they should
  have taken them off. Ere long the whole party, having placed their heads upon
  the pillow, lost the recollection of their perils and fatigue.</p>

  <p>For nearly a week did Clavering and Colonel Gunter, with two out of the
  three followers belonging to the former&mdash;namely, John Habergeon and the
  elder Saxby&mdash;remain at the Star. During this time they ran many risks of
  discovery, strict search being made for them throughout the whole district by
  the Ironsides; but such were the precautions taken by Buxted, and so great
  the vigilance and fidelity of his household, that, though on one occasion a
  party of troopers actually came to the house and remained there more than an
  hour, subjecting the host and hostess and all their servants to sharp
  interrogatories, they failed to detect their prey.</p>

  <p>On the second night, Lord Wilmot took leave of his friends, and set out
  for Trent House, in Somersetshire&mdash;the residence of Colonel Wyndham, a
  distinguished Royalist&mdash;where he expected to obtain tidings of the
  fugitive monarch. His lordship was attended by Ninian Saxby, who was to be
  the bearer of intelligence as soon as there should be any to communicate. All
  such letters were to be addressed with the greatest privacy to Colonel
  Gunter&rsquo;s residence, Racton, near Chichester, whither he and Clavering
  intended shortly to proceed.</p>

  <p>Endeavours were made by the two Cavaliers left behind at Alfriston to
  engage a vessel for the king&rsquo;s service, and with this object many
  secret visits were paid to Newhaven by John Habergeon and Eustace
  Saxby&mdash;it not being deemed prudent that the principals should be
  seen&mdash;but without much prospect of success.</p>

  <p>At the expiration of a week the two Cavaliers began to tire of the
  inactive life they were leading. Clavering&rsquo;s wound had nearly healed,
  and he had quite recovered the use of his arm, so that he was now fit for any
  service. They therefore resolved to quit their present asylum, and proceed to
  Racton. But the Ironsides being still as much on the alert as ever, it
  behoved them to be exceedingly cautious in their movements. Disguises were
  therefore procured for them by Stephen Buxted, of such kind as would be most
  likely to elude suspicion; but, for greater security, they started on their
  journey soon after midnight, and on foot.</p>

  <p>We shall find them at a halting-place on their way ere long; but,
  meanwhile, we may mention that Eustace Saxby had left them to pay a stealthy
  visit to Ovingdean Grange, and ascertain how matters were going on there; and
  that John Habergeon was to make a last attempt on that very night to hire a
  vessel at Newhaven, the result of which he had undertaken to communicate to
  Clavering and Colonel Gunter in a manner hereafter to be described.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7-5"
     name="ch7-5">CHAPTER V<br>
  How Mr. Beard And Dulcia Were Taken<br>
  As Hostages For Colonel Maunsel</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT will now be necessary to go back to the night on which
  the Royalists made their escape from Stelfax, in order to see how that
  officer comported himself after the loss of his prey. He returned to the
  house breathing vengeance against all those who had aided the prisoners in
  their flight&mdash;foremost amongst whom was Colonel Maunsel. The execution,
  however, of his vindictive schemes was deferred till the morrow, his chief
  desire at present being, if possible, to recapture the fugitives. But, as the
  Royalists had foreseen great delay was experienced in catching the horses,
  and even when this point was achieved, for some time the bridles and saddles
  could not be found. But although nearly an hour was thus wasted, the
  infuriated Republican officer would not relinquish the design of pursuit.
  Submission to defeat was intolerable to him, and so long as a chance remained
  of retrieving his discomfiture, he was resolved not to throw it away. In less
  than an hour, then, after the departure of the fugitives, he started in
  pursuit, at the head of some seven or eight men. Delves was left behind, with
  orders to watch over the house, and though he pleaded hard to be allowed to
  accompany his leader, permission was not granted him. Stelfax had noted the
  course taken in the first instance by the fugitives, and galloping to
  Rottingdean, ascertained from a fisherman, who had heard the cavalcade pass
  his cottage, that they had gone on towards Newhaven. To the latter place,
  therefore, Stelfax rode with all possible dispatch, but his mortification and
  rage were boundless, when, on arriving at the ferry, he found that the
  Royalists had got across, and that the boat was turned adrift. Further
  pursuit was, therefore, out of the question, as he was well aware there was
  no means of crossing the Ouse nearer than the bridge at Lewes.</p>

  <p>After a brief debate with himself, Stelfax, unable to brook the idea of
  returning empty-handed, sent back his men to Ovingdean, and rode on alone by
  the western side of the levels, through Rodmill and Kingston to Lewes;
  proceeding at once to the castle, where the detachment under his command was
  quartered. His first business was to call out one-and-twenty men, whom he
  divided into three parties, assigning to each a separate district&mdash;thus
  one party was instructed to make a perquisition of the coast, from Seaford to
  Eastbourne; another the mid-country, comprehending Beddingham, the Firle
  range of downs, Alciston, Selmeston, and Hailsham; and a third Mount Caburn,
  Glynde, Laughton, and Ringmer. The men were, in short, to scour the whole
  country to the south-east to Lewes, making a circuit of fifteen or twenty
  miles, or more if needed, and not to return without bringing the fugitives
  with them. It had been Stelfax&rsquo;s intention to take the command of one
  of these parties, but he began to find that fatigue had made some inroads
  even upon his iron frame, and that if he did not allow himself repose he
  might break down. Contenting himself, therefore, with giving such precise
  instructions to the men as he fancied must ensure the accomplishment of his
  purpose, he flung himself upon his hard soldier&rsquo;s couch, and became
  presently oblivious of his cares.</p>

  <p>His instructions were carefully obeyed. The whole district he had
  indicated was traversed by his men; but without effect. No traces of the
  fugitives could be detected. Whither they had gone after leaving Newhaven was
  a mystery that could not be solved&mdash;no one appearing to have seen them.
  Even when the pursuers were really on the right scent, they remained at
  fault. A visit, as we have already mentioned, was paid to the Star at
  Alfriston; but though the whole of the fugitives were at that time in the
  hostelry, they were so well concealed that not the slightest suspicion of
  their propinquity was entertained by the Ironsides. In anticipation of a
  visit of the kind, the horses brought off by the Royalists had been removed
  to an out-of-the-way shed at some distance from the inn. Luckily, no one in
  the village had witnessed the arrival of the fugitives, so betrayal was
  impossible, except by the ostler, and there was no fear of him. From
  Alfriston the troopers went on to Wilmington, where of course they did not
  learn much. But besides missing the objects of their quest, all three parties
  were more than once duped by false intelligence. Notwithstanding their
  disappointment, the search was continued throughout the day, and it was only
  at nightfall that the three divisions returned to Lewes, and faced their
  wrathful leader. Their failure was a heavy blow to Stelfax. He had delayed
  his return to Ovingdean till night, hoping to go back in triumph. But shame,
  and the sense of discomfiture, detained him till the next day, when,
  determined to make an imposing appearance, he rode thither at the head of
  fifty men.</p>

  <p>By this time, owing to the exertions of the sergeant, discipline had been
  completely restored among the men left under his charge. Helpless Henly and
  the two others, who had been guilty of insubordination and drunkenness, were
  still under arrest. Delves was therefore able to give a satisfactory account
  of himself to his leader but it was not equally satisfactory to Stelfax to
  learn that Colonel Maunsel was dangerously ill, and entirely confined to his
  bed. The vexations and anxieties undergone by the old Cavalier had proved too
  much for him. On the day after his son&rsquo;s escape with the other
  Royalists, he was unable to leave his couch, and his enfeebled condition
  greatly alarmed those in attendance upon him. No improvement had taken place
  in his health, but rather the reverse, when Stelfax arrived at the
  Grange.</p>

  <p>Without making any remark on the information he had received, but
  determined to judge for himself, the Ironside leader marched at once to the
  room in which the colonel was lying, and found him supported by pillows, and
  looking the picture of death. Mr. Beard and Dulcia were seated by the couch,
  and the former had a Bible on his knee. Both arose as Stelfax entered, and
  the old Cavalier made an effort to raise himself.</p>

  <p>For a moment not a word was said. The stern Republican officer folded his
  arms upon his breast, and gazed steadfastly, but not without a slight touch
  of compassion in his glance, at the invalided, but still noble-looking
  gentleman before him. At length he said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come to carry you a prisoner to Lewes, Colonel Maunsel. Are
  you ready to go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must prepare a litter for my transport,&rdquo; the old Cavalier
  replied, feebly. &ldquo;I cannot move a limb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely, sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Beard to Stelfax, &ldquo;if you have
  any touch of humanity in your composition you will not attempt to move the
  colonel in this state. He will never reach Lewes alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dulcia cast a supplicating look at the Roundhead leader, but did not
  speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Waste not your time in idle entreaties, my good friend,&rdquo;
  observed Colonel Maunsel, feebly. &ldquo;I know the ruthless and inflexible
  character of this man too well to suppose him accessible to the common
  dictates of humanity. Take me, sir,&rdquo; he continued, sternly. &ldquo;Bid
  your soldiers bear me, living, to the grave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remove him at your proper peril, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Beard.
  &ldquo;I warn you again that he is dangerously ill. If he dies by the way,
  his death will lie at your door.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such an occurrence, were it to take place, would not trouble me
  much,&rdquo; Stelfax rejoined. &ldquo;But I have no personal animosity to
  Colonel Maunsel, who, though an inveterate malignant, is a brave man, and I
  should be loth to abridge the little life left him. I will, therefore,
  consent to leave him undisturbed if a hostage be given me for his surrender
  in the event of recovery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What hostage do you require, sir?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Beard,
  quickly. &ldquo;I am of little account, as compared with my honoured patron.
  Yet, peradventure, I may suffice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not alone, sir,&rdquo; Stelfax replied. &ldquo;I must have your
  daughter as well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Accede not to the proposition, my good friend,&rdquo; Colonel
  Maunsel observed, faintly. &ldquo;Above all, place not Dulcia in this
  man&rsquo;s power. Let him take me. What are a few hours more of wretched
  existence to a sufferer like myself? Better&mdash;far better! they were
  ended!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must not be so, father,&rdquo; Dulcia interposed. &ldquo;Since
  hostages are required, who so fitting as we, who owe all to our generous
  protector?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are right, my child,&rdquo; said Mr. Beard. &ldquo;The course
  we ought to pursue is manifest. We will go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not consent to this,&rdquo; cried Colonel Maunsel.
  &ldquo;Dulcia may be taken to the Castle, and placed in its dungeons or in
  the martyr-cells beneath the White Hart, which have of late, as I understand,
  been put to their former use. Such barbarity shall never be practised if I
  can hinder it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no design to place either Mr. Beard or his daughter in
  actual durance, unless compelled, Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo; replied Stelfax.
  &ldquo;All I require is to have them in safe custody. They may choose a
  lodging where they will in Lewes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Promise me that, on your honour as soldier, and I am
  content,&rdquo; rejoined the old Cavalier. &ldquo;If I am ever able to leave
  this couch, I will deliver myself up to you, and then their immediate release
  must follow. Meantime, I consider myself your prisoner on parole.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax. &ldquo;You have the promise
  you require from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old Cavalier then addressed himself to Mr. Beard, and looking
  anxiously at him, said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Use my name with Master Zachary Trangmar of the Priory House, and I
  doubt not he will provide you and Dulcia with a lodging.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! the old usurer of Mock-Beggar Hall!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax.
  &ldquo;I know him. He has rooms enow, and to spare; but I doubt if much
  furniture will be found within them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There will be sufficient for us if we obtain shelter,&rdquo;
  replied the good clergyman, fearing lest some fresh difficulty should be
  thrown in the way of an arrangement which he thought beneficial to his
  patron. &ldquo;My daughter and myself will but make a few needful
  preparations, and we shall then be ready to attend you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Patty Whinchat here emerged from the corner into which she had retreated
  on the entrance of the Ironside captain, and besought his permission to
  accompany her young mistress, which was readily accorded her. Telling Mr.
  Beard that he should set forth in half an hour, Stelfax bowed a stiff adieu
  to the old Cavalier, and, quitting the room, strode down the grand staircase
  to the entrance-hall, where he found Delves awaiting orders.</p>

  <p>Meantime, the good clergyman and his daughter bade farewell&mdash;it might
  be, from the sad state in which they left him, an eternal
  valediction&mdash;to their kindly patron; Mr. Beard invoking blessing on the
  worthy gentleman&rsquo;s head, and praying Heaven to spare him; and Dulcia,
  who was drowned in tears, bending to receive the colonel&rsquo;s benediction.
  This parting over, their place was supplied by Martin Geere, whose devotion
  to his master left no doubt that the old Cavalier would be carefully tended
  by him.</p>

  <p>In allowing Colonel Maunsel to remain at his own house a prisoner on
  parole, and taking Mr. Beard and his daughter as hostages for the old
  Cavalier&rsquo;s surrender in case of recovery, Stelfax was influenced by
  other motives than those which he allowed to appear. Under such an
  arrangement, Clavering Maunsel and his friends were not unlikely, he judged,
  to pay a secret visit to the Grange, and might&mdash;were due vigilance
  observed&mdash;be recaptured; while, by withdrawing Dulcia from her present
  asylum, he would have her altogether in his power. Not wishing to alarm her
  and Mr. Beard too much in the first instance, he had proposed a lodging in
  the town, and was well pleased when the colonel mentioned old Zachary
  Trangmar, in whom he felt sure a ready instrument would be found. Such were
  some of the motives that influenced him; but he might have others, for his
  designs were dark and inscrutable. But while abandoning Ovingdean Grange,
  Stelfax deemed it necessary that careful watch should be kept over the house,
  and no one appeared to him&mdash;for reasons which he scarcely liked to
  acknowledge to himself&mdash;to be so well qualified for the office of a spy
  as the person who had recently outman&oelig;uvred him&mdash;namely, Increase
  Micklegift. But where was he to be found? Little expecting friendly overtures
  from the man he had injured, but dreading his vengeance, the Independent
  minister had fled. Stelfax questioned Delves about Micklegift, and the
  sergeant replied that there was in the village an elder named Morefruit
  Stone, who he thought might be able to communicate with the fugitive
  minister. Stelfax immediately caught at the suggestion, and said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hie thee to Stone at once, and say unto him, that if he hath any
  means of communicating with Micklegift, he may inform him that I bear him no
  malice for what he hath done to me and to my men, but desire to do him a
  friendly service, and to that end request him to come over to me without
  delay to the castle at Lewes. Lest he suspect that, perchance, there may be a
  design to ensnare him, give him a solemn assurance of safety. About thine
  errand at once!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Delves departed, and soon afterwards returned with the information that he
  had seen Stone, and had reason to believe he had succeeded in his object.</p>

  <p>During the whole time that Stelfax remained at the Grange, the troop by
  whom he was attended were not permitted to dismount, but remained drawn up
  before the gates of the mansion, where, with their fine horses and polished
  accoutrements, they made a gallant show. The whole village turned out to look
  at them; and though the household at the Grange were in great terror of a
  second visitation, which might prove worse than the first&mdash;bad as that
  had been&mdash;their curiosity at last got the better of their fears, and
  they went forth to enjoy the spectacle. Greatly were Moppett, Crundy, and the
  rest rejoiced to learn that the unwelcome guests whom they had been obliged
  to entertain and serve for two mortal days and nights, and whose insults and
  ill-usage they had endured for that seemingly interminable period, were to be
  withdrawn. But their joy was somewhat damped by learning that good Mr. Beard
  and his daughter were to be taken away from them. However, since there was no
  help for it, they must needs submit. All they could do was to pray for the
  speedy return of the worthy pastor and Mistress Dulcia. It was a great matter
  that the colonel himself&mdash;as they feared he might have been&mdash;was
  not to be taken from them.</p>

  <p>At the appointed time the poor clergyman and his daughter, followed by
  Patty carrying a cloak bag and some other trifling matters required by her
  young mistress, descended into the hall. By Stelfax&rsquo;s directions horses
  had been brought round for them from the stables, and though Dulcia would
  have willingly declined his help, the Ironside captain gallantly assisted her
  to mount her palfrey. Mr. Beard was accommodated with a strong, steady-going
  pad-nag, and Patty was placed on a pillion behind him. While this was going
  on, Delves and the troopers who had been quartered at the Grange joined their
  comrades. Helpless Henly and the two others who were still under arrest were
  deprived of their arms and guarded, looking much abashed at their ignominious
  position.</p>

  <p>All being in readiness, Stelfax sprang into the saddle, and gave the word
  to start. The walls and gables of the old mansion then rang with the
  inspiriting clangour as the trumpeters sounded a march, and the troop rode
  slowly out of the village, and mounted the hill on the right, greatly to the
  relief of the inmates of the Grange, who felt as if a heavy nightmare were
  taken off their breasts. Most of the cottagers, however, followed the
  soldiers to the summit of the eminence, and stationed themselves near the
  ancient barrow to watch the progress of the cavalcade over the downs. The day
  was fine, and the polished casques and corslets of the warriors gleamed
  brightly in the sunshine, the long array of martial-looking figures
  constituting a striking spectacle.</p>

  <p>No incident deserving mention marked the ride to Lewes. It was a
  melancholy journey to Dulcia, and not all Stelfax&rsquo;s efforts, who rode
  beside her, and who was officious in his attentions, could draw her into
  conversation. Mr. Beard was equally sad. Patty, however, whose spirits were
  ever of the lightest, was amused by the novelty of the situation, and thought
  it a fine thing to have so many stalwart-looking troopers riding beside her;
  some of whom could not help casting furtive glances at the pretty
  handmaiden.</p>

  <p>On arriving at Lewes, Stelfax conducted his prisoners at once to
  Mock-Beggar Hall. At first old Zachary Trangmar peremptorily refused to
  receive them, alleging the want of suitable accommodation, but the Ironside
  captain overruled his objections, and used such arguments with him, that, in
  the end, though with great reluctance, the old usurer assented. Eventually,
  therefore, Mr. Beard and his daughter, with her attendant, were admitted, and
  took possession of a suite of dismantled rooms, none of which contained an
  article of furniture. However, their wants in this respect were partially
  supplied, in the course of the evening, by Skrow Antram and the old couple
  whom we have described as living with Zachary in the capacity of
  servants.</p>

  The Shepherds On Mount Caburn</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOVRAN in beauty is Mount Caburn. Fairest of Sussex hills.
  Firle Ridge, with its beacon-crowned headland, frowning from the opposite
  side of the wide gorge, like a rival potentate, may be a more striking
  object&mdash;the long and precipitous escarpment of Kingston Hill, rising on
  the westerly side of the Lewes levels, is imposing&mdash;Mount Harry, with
  its historical recollections, at the back of the old town, has charms of its
  own&mdash;Ditchling is loftier&mdash;Wolstonbury and Chanctonbury have each
  special and peculiar points of attraction; but if we are called upon to
  indicate the hill which unites the greatest beauty of form with the rarest
  advantages of situation, we should unhesitatingly mention Mount Caburn.</p>

  <p>Magnificent is the prospect it commands. Look where you will the eye is
  delighted. Towards the west lies the broad alluvial plain, known as the Lewes
  Levels, through which the meandering and deep-channelled Ouse works its way
  towards its embouchure at Newhaven. Here, where the narrow and tortuous river
  is itself unseen, its course may be detected by the craft it bears along; for
  here, not unfrequently, as has been sung of the same spot.</p>

  <p>the sail</p>

  <p>Majestic moves along the sedgy vale.</p>

  <p>Here, at the present day, may be seen the swift locomotive shooting along
  its iron path towards the coast. At the opposite side of this wide
  plain&mdash;once the bed of an inland sea or marine lake&mdash;stand the
  lofty and precipitous escarpments, just mentioned, of Kingston Hill. Turn but
  a little to the north, and lo! the ancient town of Lewes rises before you
  with its lordly castle and old priory ruins, backed by Mount Harry. Yon bold
  and picturesque headland in front is Firle Beacon. It would almost seem as if
  some diluvian convulsion had torn these hills asunder. through the wide
  ravine or valley, by which they are separated, now runs a branch of the
  railway, which may be followed, if you list, for miles in a south-easterly
  direction. Tracking the line of coast, you discern Pevensey Castle and Battle
  Abbey. Close at hand is pleasant and picturesque Beddingham, with its antique
  and square-towered church; and nearer yet, at the base of the hill,
  delightfully-situated Glynde, with the old Elizabethan mansion and
  well-timbered park adjoining it. But turn again towards the east and
  north-east, and let your gaze wander over the vast district. The view is
  almost unbounded&mdash;a splendid panorama, scarcely to be surpassed for
  variety and extent. Numberless hamlets with their churches, mansions
  surrounded by parks, detached farmhouses and homesteads may be discerned in
  this wide- spread plain, while in certain parts of it the countless
  hedge-rows, interspersed with taller timber, give it the appearance of an
  immense garden.</p>

  <p>But it is not merely from the splendid prospect it enjoys, from the
  smoothness and beauty of its outline, from its gentle undulations, graceful
  slopes, deep dells and hollowed coombs, that Mount Caburn merits distinction.
  In addition to other attractions, it possesses the most perfect specimen of
  an ancient entrenchment to be met with on the Sussex Downs. The strength of
  this encampment shows the estimation in which the position it occupies was
  held. Circular in form, with double trenches, the outer of which is broad and
  deep, while the inner platform rises to a considerable height, the old
  defensive earthwork looks almost as fresh as when first constructed. Two
  centuries have, no doubt, wrought many and great changes in this part of
  Sussex; have multiplied its inhabitants, reclaimed and cultivated its wastes,
  digged sluices in its marshy levels, and, above all, carried railways through
  its plains, its devious valleys, and along its coast. But the general aspect
  of the country is the same. Above all, Mount Caburn is unchanged. In the
  middle of the seventeenth century this majestic hill looked as smooth and
  beautiful as it does in our own day.</p>

  <p>The shades of night had scarcely fled from the summit of Mount Caburn,
  when two shepherds&mdash;such, at least, their garb proclaimed
  them&mdash;emerged from the inner trench of the encampment, and mounting upon
  the elevated platform withinside, gazed towards the beacon-crowned headland
  of Firle. The habiliments of these personages, as we have said, exactly
  resembled those of the swains accustomed to tend the flocks on the downs.
  Each of them wore a long-skirted loose coat of grey serge, stout hobnailed
  boots, brown leathern gaiters, and a broad-brimmed felt hat, being
  furthermore provided with a crook. But no dog followed them, and if you could
  have looked beneath those grey serge coats, you would have found that the
  pacific-looking swains had pistols and short hunting-swords stuck in their
  belts. Moreover, if you had peered beneath the hats pulled down over their
  brows, you would have seen at once they were not the simple rustics they
  professed to be. Both of them might be termed young men, though one of them
  had the advantage of his companion in this respect by some years, and both
  might be accounted handsome. The younger of the two, indeed, was singularly
  good-looking. But as there is no need to make a mystery of the matter, we may
  state at once that they were Cavalier acquaintances, though the reader might
  have failed to recognize them as such, inasmuch as the outward distinctions
  of the party to which they belonged were gone. Long scented locks and peaked
  beards had vanished, and given place to close-cropped heads and smooth-shaven
  chins. Metamorphosed, however, as they were, the two persons were no other
  than Colonel Gunter and Clavering Maunsel.</p>

  <p>Night had but recently fled, and the sun had not yet risen to gladden the
  hills and gild them with his beams. Mists lay in the marshy levels on the
  right, and a thin curtain of vapour shrouded Beddingham, concealing all of
  the village except the square tower of its church. Mists also hung over
  Glynde Place and the woods adjoining it. But the summits of the downs, though
  grey- looking and somewhat sombre, were wholly free from fog; and a ruddy
  glow in the east announced the speedy advent of the sun. The gaze of the
  Cavaliers was turned towards the elevated ridge on the further side of the
  valley, but though both strained their eyes in this direction for some
  minutes, they could not descry the object they sought. Neither spoke, but
  each continued to look eagerly towards the Firle heights. Each moment the sky
  had been growing brighter and redder, as if the east were all a-flame, when
  suddenly the god of day himself appeared, and, ere long, the hills glowed
  with his splendour. It was at this juncture that the object which our two
  Cavaliers had sought for so eagerly became visible. It was a shepherd like
  themselves, a tall man clothed in a long-skirted loose great-coat, with a
  crook in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is there! I see him! It is John Habergeon!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Clavering. &ldquo;We shall now learn whether he has succeeded in engaging the
  vessel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has failed,&rdquo; cried Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;See you not he
  holds the crook horizontally above his head, as was agreed should be the
  signal in that event.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear it is so,&rdquo; Clavering replied. &ldquo;But give me your
  crook, and I will make the matter sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he placed the two staves crosswise, and held them aloft.</p>

  <p>In answer to the signal, the individual on the opposite hill instantly
  dropped his crook, and extended his long arms horizontally from his body.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is now no doubt whatever of failure,&rdquo; Clavering
  observed, in a tone of disappointment. &ldquo;A vessel is not to be procured
  for the king at Newhaven. We must seek for means of transport across the
  Channel elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay! he has more to communicate,&rdquo; Colonel Gunter exclaimed.
  &ldquo;He has fixed a white kerchief like a small banner to the hook of his
  staff, and hoists it aloft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is the signal of danger,&rdquo; rejoined Clavering. &ldquo;And
  look! he waves the kerchief thrice. The danger is urgent. He himself is
  making off. We must fly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, let us to Racton at once,&rdquo; Colonel Gunter returned.
  &ldquo;Nothing more is to be done here. If we are lucky enough to reach my
  house, we can rest in security, and hatch fresh schemes for his
  Majesty&rsquo;s deliverance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On this, they crossed the encampment, and plunged into the devious and
  secluded dell on the right.</p>

  <p>They reached Racton, after many hairbreadth &lsquo;scapes, on the evening
  of the following day. Nearly a fortnight elapsed before John Habergeon was
  able to join his young master, and he then brought word that Colonel Maunsel
  had been dangerously ill&mdash;in fact, at the point of death&mdash;but was
  now better. Immediately on his recovery, the colonel had gone over to Lewes
  to surrender himself to Stelfax, and procure the liberation of Mr. Beard and
  Dulcia, who had been taken as hostages for him by the Republican officer.
  This the colonel had accomplished, and he had furthermore obtained
  permission, on account of his infirmities, to continue a prisoner on parole
  at his own dwelling. Such was the sum of the intelligence brought by the old
  trooper from Ovingdean Grange; and it was far better than could have been
  anticipated. Information of Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s movements, and of those of
  his royal master, was furnished by the faithful and active emissary, Ninian
  Saxby, who passed constantly to and fro between the Cavaliers in various
  disguises. Many changes of plan took place, but at last it was definitively
  settled that the king should embark at Shoreham, and Colonel Gunter received
  orders to hire Captain Tattersall&rsquo;s brig, the Swiftsure.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7-7"
     name="ch7-7">CHAPTER VII<br>
  What Happened At The &ldquo;Dolphin&rdquo; At Shoreham</a></h2>

  <p class="first">OUR story must now be advanced about a week beyond the
  foregoing date, which will bring us to the 13th of October, 1651. On the
  afternoon of this day, two well-mounted horsemen, followed at a respectful
  distance by a servant likewise on horseback, rode from Bramber towards
  Shoreham. To judge from their attire, both horsemen must be Roundheads. They
  wore neither laced cloaks nor laced bands. Their garments were sad-coloured,
  and destitute of all embroidery, and their hats tall and steeple-crowned, and
  lacking feathers. Moreover, their locks were cropped close to the head. Their
  servant, a tall, powerful-looking man, well-stricken in years, was habited as
  became a follower of such puritanical-looking masters. But though the
  horsemen were dressed like Roundheads, their deportment, when not in the
  presence of witnesses, would have led to a very different conclusion, and any
  one who could have listened to their discourse would soon have learnt that
  they belonged to the opposite faction. Once more we have to announce our
  friends Colonel Gunter and Clavering Maunsel in a new disguise, though it
  will be scarcely necessary, we think, to state that their tall old
  serving-man was John Habergeon.</p>

  <p>From its advantageous situation near the mouth of the Adur, Shoreham soon
  became one of the principal harbours on the Sussex coast. At the time of our
  Tale it was much frequented, and several sloops, with other vessels of larger
  tonnage, were now to be seen in the haven. At low water, the embouchure of
  the Adur, which is of some width, is characterized by large, glistening banks
  of mud, but as the channel at this time happened to be full, it presented the
  appearance of a broad and goodly river. The ancient church, with the
  habitations near it, which could be seen on the near banks of the river, was
  that of Old Shoreham; but it was towards New Shoreham and its haven that our
  friends bent their course. Here, as at the older seaport, there is a church
  of great antiquity and beauty; and after passing this noble
  structure&mdash;not without bestowing upon it a glance of
  admiration&mdash;the disguised Cavaliers proceeded to the Dolphin, an inn
  built on the edge of the quay, much frequented by seafaring people, and then
  tenanted by one Absolom. Bridger. Dismounting, and giving their horses to
  John Habergeon, by whom they were taken to the stables, the two friends
  entered the house, and after ordering some oysters and a bottle of sack, and
  desiring to be shown into a private room, Colonel Gunter inquired of the host
  whether he knew Captain Tattersall, of the Swiftsure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know him! I have known Nick Tattersall since he was a boy!&rdquo;
  exclaimed Bridger; &ldquo;and a better seaman or an honester fellow
  doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou speakest warmly of him, friend Absolom,&rdquo; replied Colonel
  Gunter, thinking it necessary, to support his puritanical character;
  &ldquo;but is he in your harbour of Shoreham at present?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was here this very morning,&rdquo; Bridger replied, &ldquo;by
  the same token that he discussed a cup of sack with an egg in it. He has but
  newly returned from Plymouth, and will soon make a trip to Poole, in
  Dorsetshire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I have heard,&rdquo; replied Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;I have a
  commission to give him, and would gladly speak with him, if he can be
  found.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Found he can easily be, I will answer for it,&rdquo; Bridger
  replied. &ldquo;I will fetch him to you anon, and you shall have the oysters
  and sack without delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not many minutes after the host&rsquo;s disappearance, the door was
  suddenly opened, and a tall man, clad in a plainly-cut black cloak and Geneva
  band, and wearing a lofty steeple-crowned hat, peered inquisitively into the
  room. His eye rested upon Clavering, who at once recognized him, and was
  about to address him, when the other raised his finger to his lips in token
  of silence, hastily retreated, and closed the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is that mysterious personage?&rdquo; Colonel Gunter inquired,
  not altogether liking the intrusion. &ldquo;I hope he is not an
  enemy&mdash;he evidently knows you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought to regard him as a friend, seeing that he once rendered me
  a most important service,&rdquo; Clavering replied. &ldquo;But I confess I
  distrust him, and am sorry to see him here. It is Increase Micklegift, who,
  when our worthy Mr. Beard was deprived of his living at Ovingdean, succeeded
  to the church. He is an Independent minister. Ever since he assisted Lord
  Wilmot and myself, with the others, to escape from the church, he has never
  dared, so I learn from John Habergeon, to show himself at the rectory or in
  the village. I am surprised to find him here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry he recognized you,&rdquo; Colonel Gunter replied,
  somewhat thoughtfully; &ldquo;for though he may not suspect our errand, he
  may be troublesome to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think any danger is to be apprehended from him,&rdquo;
  Clavering replied. &ldquo;He is in as much jeopardy as we ourselves are, and
  if he were to fall into Stelfax&rsquo;s hands little clemency would be shown
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Granting that his conduct has compromised him with the
  Roundheads,&rdquo; observed Colonel Gunter, &ldquo;do you not see, my good
  young friend, that he is the more likely to be anxious to purchase his
  safety, which he might easily do if he knew our design. He could make his own
  terms with Stelfax.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; rejoined Clavering, uneasily. &ldquo;I see the danger.
  But I trust it may be averted. Ah! here comes our host. We will question him
  on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As he spoke, Master Bridger entered with the oysters and a flask of
  wine, and as he was placing them on the table, Clavering said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, worthy host, who was the tall man who looked into the room
  just now? He had the air of a preacher of the gospel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And such he is,&rdquo; Bridger replied. &ldquo;I dare not mention
  his name, for he is in some trouble with the authorities. It may be that he
  mistook the door, for he occupies the adjoining chamber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! he is in the next room!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Gunter,
  glancing significantly at Clavering. &ldquo;Bring clean pipes, Absolom, and a
  paper of thy best Spanish tobacco.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anon, anon! worshipful sirs. I have done your bidding as regards
  Captain Tattersall. A messenger has been dispatched for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show him in on his arrival,&rdquo; said Colonel Gunter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall not have long to wait, then,&rdquo; answered Bridger with
  a laugh. &ldquo;I hear his lusty voice outside. Walk in, Captain
  Tattersall&mdash;walk in,&rdquo; he added, opening the door. &ldquo;These are
  the gentlemen who desire to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shipmaster who was thus introduced seemed a very good specimen of his
  class, and his looks by no means belied the favourable description of him
  given by the host. Apparently, he was turned forty, but his features were so
  brown and weather-beaten that it was difficult to determine his age
  precisely. Squarely built, and somewhat under the middle size, he had a
  broad, good- humoured, honest-looking physiognomy, by no means destitute of
  shrewdness, and seemed every inch a seaman. He was rather roughly attired,
  his apparel consisting of a Guernsey shirt, a loose jacket of stout blue
  cloth, ample galligaskins, or slops of brown flannel, nether hose of the same
  colour, and square-toed shoes. On his head he had a cap, originally bright
  scarlet, though now somewhat weather-stained; but this he doffed on entering
  the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Captain Nicholas Tattersall, worthy sirs,&rdquo; said
  Bridger, slapping the skipper familiarly on the back as he spoke; &ldquo;as
  honest a shipmaster&mdash;I will say it to his face&mdash;as ever
  sailed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A truce to compliments, friend Absolom,&rdquo; said Tattersall,
  bluntly&mdash;his voice was deep and hoarse, as might be expected from such a
  broad-chested personage. &ldquo;You know I like them not. Your servant,
  gentlemen,&rdquo; he added to the others. &ldquo;You desire to speak to me,
  as I understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Colonel Gunter replied. &ldquo;Pray be seated,
  Captain Tattersall. Happy to make your acquaintance, sir. Bring another
  glass, Absolom. Will it please you to taste this sack, captain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The captain prefers brandy, worthy sir,&rdquo; hastily interposed
  Bridger, &ldquo;I have a runlet of rare old Nantz, given me by a French
  skipper, which I keep for his special drinking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring the brandy at once, then,&rdquo; said Colonel Gunter,
  &ldquo;and take care we be not interrupted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon this the host departed, but almost immediately reappeared with a very
  promising-looking square-shaped bottle, the contents of which having been
  tasted by Tattersall, were pronounced by him to be the right sort. Having
  thus attended to all the requirements of his guests, Bridger left them and
  closed the door. As he went forth, Clavering satisfied himself that no
  eavesdropper was without. Pipes were next lighted, and glasses filled. After
  a few preliminary whiffs, Tattersall said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen, what may be your business with me?&rdquo; adding,
  with rather a droll expression of countenance, &ldquo;Nothing against the
  Republic, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;nothing treasonable,&rdquo; Colonel Gunter replied,
  with a laugh. Take another glass of brandy, captain, and then we&rsquo;ll
  enter upon the business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much obliged, but I&rsquo;ve had enough for the present,&rdquo;
  Tattersall rejoined, dryly. &ldquo;Come, masters, speak out! You
  needn&rsquo;t be palavering with me. Something&rsquo;s in the wind, I can see
  plainly enough. What is it? You make believe to be Roundheads, but I know on
  which side your swords would be drawn if it came to a fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And on which side, in your apprehension, would it be, Captain
  Tattersall?&rdquo; demanded Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the king&rsquo;s, Master Clavering Maunsel,&rdquo; the skipper
  replied, with a wink. &ldquo;Lord bless me! though you have cropped your
  locks, and put on the raiments of the sanctified, do you think I don&rsquo;t
  know you? Here&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s health, young sir,&rdquo; he
  proceeded, filling his glass from the square-shaped bottle, &ldquo;and
  somebody else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he added, in a whisper. &ldquo;We understand
  each other now, gentlemen, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We very soon shall do so,&rdquo; replied Colonel Gunter, with a
  laugh. &ldquo;You are right in all your surmises, Captain Tattersall. I am a
  loyalist as well as my young friend Clavering Maunsel. Our business with you
  may be told in a word. We want you to convey two friends of ours&mdash;two
  particular friends&mdash;privily across the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two particular friends, eh!&rdquo; cried Tattersall. &ldquo;Oh yes!
  I do understand,&rdquo; he added, with a wink. &ldquo;Very intimate friends,
  no doubt. Why not call them relations&mdash;near relations&mdash;such as
  fathers, or brothers, or uncles?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mistake me, captain,&rdquo; rejoined Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;The
  gentlemen in question are relatives neither of Mr. Clavering Maunsel nor of
  myself. They are merely friends. They are not even fugitive Cavaliers; but
  having been engaged in a fatal duel, desire to get out of the way till the
  affair has blown over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the plain English of it, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed the
  skipper, somewhat incredulously. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re not inclined to
  trust me. Quite right to be cautious. But I thought young Mr. Maunsel knew me
  too well to doubt me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have the most perfect confidence in you, Captain
  Tattersall,&rdquo; said Clavering, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you daren&rsquo;t commit our friends,&rdquo; supplied the
  skipper. &ldquo;I understand. Well, I&rsquo;ve no objection to take these
  unlucky duellists across the Channel, if you make it worth my while. What do
  you offer for the job?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fifty golden caroluses,&rdquo; replied Colonel Gunter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! I might have been content with that sum if they had been
  political offenders&mdash;good men, with a price set upon their
  heads&mdash;but simple fugitives from justice must pay double.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t haggle about the payment,&rdquo; rejoined
  Gunter. &ldquo;Let it be a bargain. Say a hundred caroluses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fifty as earnest, or I won&rsquo;t engage,&rdquo; cried
  Tattersall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; replied Colonel Gunter, tossing him a bag of
  gold, which had originally come out of Zachary Trangmar&rsquo;s chest.
  &ldquo;Count them at your leisure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do business,&rdquo; said Tattersall,
  laughing, as he took the bag. &ldquo;But mark me!&rdquo; he added, with a
  slight change of tone. &ldquo;I make one condition. I must see the gentlemen
  before I agree to take them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you have agreed! you are partly paid!&rdquo; Colonel Gunter
  exclaimed, somewhat sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The money shall be refunded, of course, if I can&rsquo;t fulfil my
  engagement,&rdquo; replied Tattersall, coolly. &ldquo;But as I have just
  said, I must see the gentlemen. Seamen have strange fancies, and I
  mayn&rsquo;t like their looks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure you will, Tattersall,&rdquo; remarked Clavering,
  laughing; &ldquo;Colonel Gunter need not be uneasy as to your
  stipulation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this Colonel Gunter?&rdquo; cried the skipper, eyeing the person
  named. &ldquo;I was not aware of it. Your humble servant, colonel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir, I am yours,&rdquo; replied Gunter, returning his bow.
  &ldquo;Well, then, if the countenances of my friends please you, they are to
  have a passage? Is it so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tattersall nodded assent, but did not remove the pipe from his mouth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When can you start?&rdquo; pursued Gunter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The wind is sou&rsquo;-west, and not favourable for crossing the
  Channel,&rdquo; the skipper replied; &ldquo;and I must get in my cargo, for
  it won&rsquo;t do to let my men into the scheme. My next trip is fixed for
  Poole, and I must ostensibly hold to the arrangement. But I may be ready in a
  couple of days, or three at the outside, if that will do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must do, captain,&rdquo; replied Gunter. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
  lose any time. My friends are very anxious to be off. You will never forgive
  yourself if anything should happen&mdash;to one of them in
  particular&mdash;in consequence of the delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; exclaimed Tattersall, with a knowing look;
  &ldquo;then the &lsquo;one in particular&rsquo; must be of vast interest to
  me. However, I won&rsquo;t make any further inquiries, since you are not
  disposed to satisfy me. Where and when shall we meet again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Colonel Gunter consulted Clavering by a look.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let the meeting take place at my father&rsquo;s house, at Ovingdean
  Grange, on the evening of the day after to-morrow,&rdquo; said young
  Maunsel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied the skipper. &ldquo;I know the Grange well, I
  often go to Rottingdean. I shall be glad to see your worthy father, Colonel
  Maunsel, for whom I have a high respect. I was sorry to hear he had got into
  some trouble of late. I was told he had been taken to Lewes
  Castle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your information is not exactly correct, captain,&rdquo; Clavering
  replied. &ldquo;Our chaplain, Mr. Beard, the deprived pastor of Ovingdean,
  and his daughter, were taken in his stead, my father being nearly at
  death&rsquo;s door when the Ironside leader, Stelfax, came to make him a
  prisoner. On his recovery, about a week ago, the colonel went to Lewes to
  surrender himself and obtain the release of his hostages, and met with better
  treatment than he anticipated: not only did he procure the liberation of Mr.
  Beard and his daughter, but he was allowed to remain a prisoner on parole at
  Ovingdean, where all three now are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Tattersall. &ldquo;If all goes
  well, on the afternoon of the day after to-morrow&mdash;that is to say on
  Wednesday, it being now Monday&mdash;about five o&rsquo;clock, I will be at
  Ovingdean Grange. If anything should prevent my coming, I will send. But your
  friends may hold themselves prepared to start. I will get all ready&mdash;if
  I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You clog your promises with so many doubts, captain,&rdquo;
  observed Colonel Gunter, &ldquo;that you also must make me fear their
  fulfilment. However, I will hope for the best. At five o&rsquo;clock on
  Wednesday next I shall expect to see you at Ovingdean Grange, and my friends
  must then abide your scrutiny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if Captain Tattersall, when he does see them, be not delighted
  to lend them aid, he is not the man I take him for,&rdquo; said
  Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; replied the skipper, rising.
  &ldquo;Since time presses, I will go and see about getting in my cargo at
  once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay, Tattersall,&rdquo; cried Clavering, filling the
  skipper&rsquo;s glass. &ldquo;One toast ere you go; I&rsquo;m sure you
  won&rsquo;t refuse it: May the king enjoy his own again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May the king enjoy his own again!&rdquo; cried the skipper,
  emptying the glass; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; he added, significantly, &ldquo;if I
  can help him to it, I will. What was that noise? I thought I heard some one
  suddenly start up in the next room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied Clavering. &ldquo;The room is occupied
  by an Independent minister, lately of Ovingdean. But he couldn&rsquo;t
  overhear us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; replied Tattersall. &ldquo;I hate the
  Independents. Adieu, gentlemen. On Wednesday, at five.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till then adieu, captain,&rdquo; said Gunter. &ldquo;And harkye,
  don&rsquo;t mention a word that has passed to your wife&mdash;if you happen
  to possess one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No fear of my blabbing, colonel,&rdquo; replied Tattersall. And he
  quitted the room.</p>

  <p>Clavering went out immediately after him, and found that the door of the
  adjoining room was open, and the apartment vacant. Micklegift, if he had been
  there, was gone.</p>

  <p>The two gentlemen did not remain much longer at the Dolphin but paid their
  reckoning and called for their horses, which were soon brought out by John
  Habergeon. They then rode through Old Shoreham, and kept along the Bramber
  road, on the banks of the Arun, until they reached the bridge.</p>

  <p>Here they dismissed John Habergeon, who was directed by Clavering to pay a
  secret visit that night to Ovingdean Grange, and acquaint his father that all
  had been satisfactorily arranged, and that he and his friends might be
  expected on Wednesday afternoon. Charged with this message, of the importance
  of which, insignificant as it sounded, he was well aware, the old trooper
  rode up the acclivities on the right of the valley, and soon disappeared.</p>

  <p>Having crossed the bridge, the two gentlemen pursued the high road to
  Chichester, and reached Racton late in the day, without misadventure.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk8"

  <h2><a id="ch8-1"
     name="ch8-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  The Paper Bullet</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON their return to Racton that night, Colonel Gunter and his
  guest partook of supper, and were still seated over a flask of excellent
  Bordeaux, when a confidential servant entered, and informed his master that
  the messenger had just arrived, and craved admittance.</p>

  <p>The colonel looked surprised, but bade the man show the messenger in
  without delay. Whereupon the servant withdrew, and presently afterwards
  reappeared with Ninian Saxby.</p>

  <p>The young falconer had doffed the gay and becoming habiliments in which he
  appeared during the time of his service with Colonel Maunsel, and was now
  very soberly clad in a tight-fitting jerkin of black cloth, a long black
  cloak without plait or ornament, funnel-topped boots armed with large spurs,
  a small plain band, and a steeple-crowned hat. By his side he wore a long
  tuck&mdash;a weapon proper to the fanatical party to which he was now
  supposed to belong. His brown curling locks, once his ornament and pride, no
  longer offended the severe eye of the zealot. Shears, remorseless as those of
  Atropos, had cropped them off close to his head; rendering him, in Cavalier
  parlance, &ldquo;a prick-eared cur.&rdquo; But the merry eye, laughing
  features, and careless bearing of the young man somewhat belied his
  puritanical attire; though, no doubt, he could assume a more sedate look and
  deportment when occasion required.</p>

  <p>Colonel Gunter waited till the servant had retired, and then asked Ninian
  whence he came?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Hambledon, in Hampshire,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does the king lodge to-night?&rdquo; demanded Colonel Gunter.
  &ldquo;Tarries he still at Hele House, near Amesbury, where my worthy cousin
  Hyde has been fortunate enough to afford him an asylum?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, your honour,&rdquo; Ninian replied. &ldquo;His Majesty quitted
  Hele House this morning, after remaining there for three or four days, and
  came on to Hambledon, on his way into Sussex. He and the noble Lord Wilmot
  will pass the night at the house of worshipful Master Symons, who, as I
  believe, married your honour&rsquo;s sister; though, as far as I can guess,
  the lady only, and not her husband, will be made acquainted with the rank of
  her guests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And quite right too,&rdquo; cried Colonel Gunter, with a laugh.
  &ldquo;Tom Symons, though a worthy fellow, is too fond of the bottle to be
  trusted in a matter of such vital consequence. But my sister, though I say
  it, is a woman in a thousand, and entire reliance may be placed upon her
  judgment and discretion. But hast thou nothing for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This little ball, your honour, which I should have swallowed if I
  had fallen into the hands of the Philistines,&rdquo; Ninian replied.</p>

  <p>So saying, he produced a small paper bullet, and handed it with the points
  of his fingers to Colonel Gunter, who, having unfolded the tightly-compressed
  sheet of tissue paper, and carefully smoothed its creases, soon made himself
  master of the contents of the letter, which then became apparent. This done,
  he crushed the dispatch in his hand, and tossed it into the wood fire blazing
  cheerily on the hearth, where it was instantly consumed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord Wilmot writes that his Majesty is eager to embark,&rdquo; the
  colonel observed to Clavering, &ldquo;and fully calculating upon our success
  in hiring Tattersall&rsquo;s brig, proposes to go on board tomorrow night.
  His lordship assigns no reason for thus advancing the hour of departure; but
  the king may, perhaps, have taken alarm at some movement of the enemy, or it
  may only be a natural anxiety on his Majesty&rsquo;s part to get out of
  harm&rsquo;s way. Was aught said on the subject to thee, Ninian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His lordship told me that the king desires most ardently to embark
  to-morrow night,&rdquo; replied Ninian, &ldquo;or early in the morning, as
  his Majesty entertains the notion that the moment will be propitious for his
  escape, and that, if deferred, ill consequences may ensue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how are we to carry out the king&rsquo;s wishes?&rdquo; cried
  Gunter. &ldquo;We have arranged with Tattersall for Wednesday night, not
  Wednesday morning, and it will be scarcely possible, I fear, to prevail upon
  the stubborn skipper to set sail earlier. Besides, the rascal stipulated for
  an interview with his two passengers before he would agree to convey them
  across the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Clavering; &ldquo;but Tattersall is a loyal
  fellow, and I believe him to be only desirous of satisfying himself that it
  is the king who is to sail with him. Had he been trusted, in my opinion he
  would not have made the stipulation; but you did not deem such a course
  prudent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I judged it better not to tell him too much,&rdquo; replied Gunter.
  &ldquo;Not that I believe for a moment that the reward offered by the Council
  of state would tempt him to betray the king. He is too loyal and honest for
  such a detestable act. But when the penalties of high treason stare him in
  the face&mdash;when loss of life and confiscation of property may follow his
  complicity in a scheme like the present&mdash;I feel unwilling to alarm him,
  lest he may decline altogether.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no fear of him,&rdquo; cried Clavering. &ldquo;Animated by
  the same spirit of loyalty as ourselves, he will run all risks to save his
  sovereign. Should we hesitate if placed in a similar situation? Would the
  fear of death affright us? Assuredly not. We should rather rejoice in the
  opportunity afforded of proving our loyalty and devotion. Such I firmly
  believe to be Tattersall&rsquo;s sentiments. But come what may, he must be
  ready to take his Majesty and Lord Wilmot on board to-morrow night, and to
  set sail on the following day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will engage that Captain Tattersall shall be ready, if your
  honours choose to confide in me,&rdquo; said Ninian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou!&rdquo; exclaimed both his auditors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I,&rdquo; the young falconer replied; &ldquo;and that without
  further compromising his Majesty than has been done at present. I will ride
  over to Shoreham to- night, see Captain Tattersall early in the morning, and
  make all straight with him. The Swiftsure shall be ready to receive her royal
  passenger at midnight to- morrow, and to sail ere daybreak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Accomplish this, and thou wilt earn a title to thy
  sovereign&rsquo;s gratitude,&rdquo; said Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;In any case,
  thou mayst rest assured of a good reward from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And from me also,&rdquo; said Clavering. &ldquo;Hark thee, Ninian,
  so soon as thou hast arranged matters with Tattersall, ride on to the Grange,
  and acquaint my father with the change of plans. John Habergeon will have led
  him to expect us on Wednesday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your commands shall be obeyed,&rdquo; replied Ninian, turning to
  depart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Gunter; &ldquo;thou hast not yet
  told us where we are to meet Lord Wilmot and his Majesty to-morrow
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought his lordship&rsquo;s letter might have mentioned the
  place of rendezvous,&rdquo; replied Ninian. &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock in
  the morning, the king and his escort will leave Mr. Symons&rsquo;s house,
  near Hambledon, and your honour and Captain Clavering are to meet them, an
  hour later, in the central avenue of Stanstead Forest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;We must be astir
  betimes, Clavering. And now, Ninian, I will not detain thee longer than shall
  enable thee to drink a bumper of canary to his Majesty&rsquo;s prosperous
  voyage across the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, he filled a goblet with wine, and gave it to the young
  falconer, who did justice to the pledge proposed to him. Colonel Gunter then
  inquired from Ninian whether his horse was fully equal to the journey he had
  to perform, and being answered in the affirmative, he bade the young man good
  night, enjoining him to act with the utmost caution, since much now depended
  upon him.</p>

  <p>Ninian, with much earnestness, and more modesty than he usually exhibited,
  replied that he felt the full responsibility of the task he had undertaken,
  and would discharge it to the best of his ability. He then took his
  departure, and in less than a quarter of an hour started for Shoreham.</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards the two Cavaliers, having to rise early, with the
  prospect of a hard day&rsquo;s work to follow, retired to rest.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-2"
     name="ch8-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  A Royal Wanderer</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FIVE o&rsquo;clock had not struck next morning, when Colonel
  Gunter entered Clavering&rsquo;s chamber, and found his guest not only awake,
  but fully attired and prepared for the journey. So blithe were the young
  man&rsquo;s looks, that Colonel Gunter could not help commenting upon them,
  and said, &ldquo;I am glad to see you look so cheerful, my young friend. It
  shows that you calculate on success, and I doubt not your anticipations will
  be realized.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ere many hours have flown, his Majesty, I hope, will have quitted
  these ungrateful shores,&rdquo; said Clavering; &ldquo;and I feel assured
  that although he is now driven hence by the malice of rebels and fanatics, he
  will return to his kingdom in triumph.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; replied Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;Like myself, I see you
  are well armed&mdash;pistols in your belt and rapier by your side. I trust we
  shall have no occasion to use our weapons. But the king shall never fall into
  the hands of the rebels while we have breath to defend him. And now, since
  you are ready, let us set forth at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; replied Clavering; &ldquo;I am impatient
  to greet his Majesty on the day which I trust will be that of his happy
  deliverance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>None of the household were astir at this early hour except the
  confidential servant who had waited upon his master on the previous evening.
  Their attentive personage had prepared a slight repast for them, and set it
  out in the library, but neither of the gentlemen cared to partake of it, nor
  would they be prevailed upon to fortify their stomachs against the morning
  air by a glass of strong waters, at the butler&rsquo;s recommendation.
  Proceeding at once to the stables, they mounted their steeds, which they
  found in readiness, and rode off.</p>

  <p>Racton, Colonel Gunter&rsquo;s residence, it has already been mentioned,
  was about four miles to the north-west of Chichester, and though a house of
  no great size or pretension, was very pleasantly situated at a short distance
  from Stanstead Park, then belonging to Lord Lumley. This park, with the
  stately mansion in the midst of it, now lay before our friends; they did not,
  however, enter it, but skirting the moss-grown palings by which it was
  surrounded, shaped their course towards the forest, which lay further to the
  west. As the sun had not yet appeared to enliven nature with his kindling
  beams, and dispel the mists of night, which still hung heavy over the woods
  and the landscape, the atmosphere felt excessively cold, causing the two
  gentlemen to draw their ample cloaks somewhat more tightly round them. It was
  now, it must be borne in mind, the middle of October, and the foliage was
  dyed with the glowing tints bestowed by the later days of autumn. Heavy dews
  hung on the leaves, and the ferns, briars, and gorse growing on the roadside
  were plentifully charged with moisture.</p>

  <p>The horses snorted frequently and loudly as their riders walked them
  along, and the breath from the animal&rsquo;s nostrils arose like steam. The
  rabbits on the sandy banks scudded off to their holes on the approach of the
  horsemen. The pheasant ran along the ground, thickly strewn with brown
  leaves, and gained the shelter of the copse. The blackbird started from the
  holly-bush, and the cries of the jay, the mellow notes of the wood-pigeon,
  and the chatter of the magpie resounded from the thicket. Ere long the two
  Cavaliers gained the forest, which was of considerable extent, and boasted
  some noble timber, being especially rich, like most large woods in this part
  of Sussex, in beech-trees. Passing a grove of these magnificent trees,
  crowning a sandy eminence from which their mighty roots protruded, our
  friends began to descend a long sweeping glade, broken here and there by
  scattered trees&mdash;ancient oaks with gnarled trunks and giant arms,
  towering elms, or venerable thorns. In a ferny brake on the right was couched
  a herd of deer, and as the two horsemen neared them, these graceful denizens
  of the forest started up from their bed, and tripped across the glade. A
  little further on, the deep secluded character of the forest in some measure
  disappeared, though the scene lost nothing of its picturesqueness and sylvan
  beauty.</p>

  <p>By this time the sun had begun to o&rsquo;er-top the trees on the east,
  and to light up the groves on the western side of the glade, chequering the
  open sward with shadows, though the opposite side was still buried in gloom.
  Riding quickly on, the two Cavaliers speedily reached the central avenue in
  the forest&mdash;a wide alley two miles in length, and skirted by noble
  trees&mdash;and they had no sooner entered it than they descried a little
  cavalcade advancing from the opposite direction, though still about a mile
  off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yonder comes the king!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;We
  are not a minute too soon, after all. Forward! my young
  friend&mdash;forward!&rdquo; And as he spoke he urged on his steed, while
  Clavering likewise quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>The cavalcade descried by our friends consisted of four persons, all well
  mounted, and all plainly attired in sad-coloured garments&mdash;long black
  cloaks, square-toed boots drawn above the knee, and hats with tall conical
  crowns and broad penthouse brims. They might have been taken for demure and
  fanatical Republicans. The two gentlemen in advance were Colonel Robert
  Philips, of Montacute House, in Somersetshire, a devoted Royalist, and
  Captain Thomas Gunter, our worthy colonel&rsquo;s kinsman. Of the pair who
  came behind, he who rode on the left was Lord Wilmot; but it is the
  individual on the right who claims our chief attention.</p>

  <p>Tall of stature, and, so far as could be judged in his unbecoming attire,
  strongly and well proportioned, this personage possessed features which could
  scarcely be termed handsome. And yet, though the countenance might be
  somewhat harsh, the eyes were so large, quick, and expressive, so full of
  fire and intelligence, of malice and, it might be, merriment, that it was
  difficult to say that he was ill-looking. The owner of that remarkable
  physiognomy used himself to describe it as ugly, but it may be doubted
  whether any one else concurred with him in opinion. The features, though
  large, and perhaps a little coarse, were by no means heavy, but susceptible
  of the most captivating, vivacious, and humorous expression. Drollery,
  indeed, and good humour might be said to characterize the face, though there
  was a strong touch of sarcasm about the mouth. The complexion of the person
  under consideration was singularly swarthy, his eyebrows thick and black, and
  the little that could be seen of his close-cropped hair, of the same raven
  hue. Such was the fugitive monarch, Charles Stuart, as he appeared to the two
  Cavaliers when they rode forward to salute him.</p>

  <p>As our friends came within a bow-shot of the king, he ordered a halt, and
  stood still to await their approach&mdash;his attendants drawing back so as
  to leave his Majesty in front. On seeing the little cortge halt in this
  manner, the two Cavaliers slackened their pace, approaching the royal
  wanderer as ceremoniously and with as profound respect as if he had been
  surrounded by a large retinue, and aided and accompanied by all the pomp and
  show of princely state. When within a short distance of the king, they both
  drew up, and, uncovering, bowed to the saddle-bow. Charles returned their
  salutation with the dignity and grace peculiar to him. His whole deportment
  was changed, and notwithstanding his sorry attire, he now looked every inch a
  king. Nothing could be more affable and condescending than his manner, while
  the air of majesty which he ceased not to retain, heightened the effect of
  his gracious demeanour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well met, gentlemen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A good morning to both
  of you. Delighted to see you. Approach, Mr. Clavering Maunsel. We have not
  seen you since the night after Worcester&rsquo;s luckless engagement, when,
  at great personal risk, you delivered us from imminent capture by the rebels.
  Approach, brave young sir, that we may tender our thanks for the service,
  which, rest assured, will never be obliterated from our memory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this intimation, Clavering sprang from his steed, and giving the bridle
  to Colonel Gunter, stepped forward, and bending the knee reverentially before
  the young monarch, kissed the hand which the latter extended towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rise, sir,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;We are greatly beholden to
  you, but you must content yourself with bare thanks for the present, our
  fallen estate not permitting us the means of adequately rewarding services
  like yours. But a day may come, and then they shall not be forgotten. And
  now, what tidings do you bring of your worthy father?&mdash;he is well, I
  trust? And the valiant old trooper who fought with him at Edge Hill and
  Naseby, and whom he sent with you to Worcester&mdash;how is he
  named?&mdash;let me see&mdash;oh! John Habergeon&mdash;how fares it with the
  tough old fellow? I trust no prick-eared fanatic has shortened his days? We
  shall put Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s loyalty and hospitality to the proof, for
  we propose to pass a few hours with him at Ovingdean Grange before proceeding
  to Shoreham. The visit, we trust, can be made without risk? But these
  questions, and others which we design to put to you, can be answered more
  leisurely as we ride along. So mount, young sir, and take a place beside
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And while Clavering hastened to obey his Majesty&rsquo;s behest, Charles
  accorded an equally gracious reception to Colonel Gunter; with this
  difference only, that he allowed the latter to perform the ceremony of
  kissing hands without quitting the saddle.</p>

  <p>The cavalcade was now once more in motion, and proceeding at a trot along
  the avenue. Colonel Philips and Captain Gunter rode in advance as before,
  while the rear was brought up by Colonel Gunter and Lord Wilmot, the king and
  Clavering occupying the centre. After a little preliminary discourse, Charles
  broached the subject of greatest interest to himself, and inquired, with an
  anxiety which he did not attempt to conceal, whether Tattersall&rsquo;s
  vessel was engaged, and ready to sail that night, or early in the
  morning?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The brig is secured, as I trust, sire,&rdquo; Clavering replied;
  &ldquo;but arrangements were made for to-morrow night, not for the morning.
  However, I do not believe that the earlier hour will make much difference to
  Captain Tattersall; and our faithful messenger Ninian Saxby, has already been
  dispatched to him to expedite matters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tattersall must start before daybreak to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
  said Charles. &ldquo;I am superstitious enough to attach great importance to
  the arrangement, and feel persuaded that delay will be fraught with
  danger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven forfend!&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering. &ldquo;I would we had
  been sooner aware of your Majesty&rsquo;s wishes in this
  particular.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That could not easily be,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;Till
  yesterday I was indifferent to the matter, but now I am bent upon
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Far be it from me to attempt to shake your Majesty&rsquo;s
  resolution,&rdquo; said Clavering. &ldquo;You would not, I am sure, feel so
  strong a conviction without cause. And perhaps this acceleration of your
  plans may save you from some secret danger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his thoughts involuntarily reverted to Micklegift, but he did
  not think it needful to mention his misgivings to the king. &ldquo;I had
  previously prepared my father for the honour and gratification he might
  expect in a visit from your Majesty tomorrow; but his impatience will be so
  great that he will be far better pleased that it should occur
  to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope we shall take him by surprise,&rdquo; said the king.
  &ldquo;I do not desire him to make any preparations. I must be received by
  him, not as the king, but as plain William Jackson. Besides, if by any
  accident the expected visit of to-morrow should have reached the enemy, and
  bring them to the house, they will be a day too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Clavering, thoughtfully. &ldquo;All things
  considered, I am not sorry that your Majesty has advanced the hour of your
  departure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this juncture an opening in the trees displayed a fine view of the
  country, the prospect being terminated by Portsmouth, with its shipping, and
  the Isle of Wight.</p>

  <p>The king stopped to gaze at the scene, and his little escort halted
  likewise. After looking for a few moments at the distant arsenal, with its
  forts, docks, and storehouses, he exclaimed, in tones of some emotion, not
  unmingled with bitterness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that yon noble arsenal, with its fortifications and stores, and
  the powerful fleet in its harbour, were mine! I should not need more to
  regain my kingdom. But all have fallen from me except you, my faithful
  followers, and a few others, and I ought, therefore, to estimate your loyalty
  at its true value.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a brief pause he continued, in a voice of deep emotion, &ldquo;Now
  that the hour is almost come when I must exile myself from my country, and
  seek shelter on a foreign shore, I shrink from the effort, and almost prefer
  death to a flight, which has something cowardly and dishonourable about
  it&mdash;unworthy of the descendant of a royal line, and himself a
  king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;View not your withdrawal in that light, my gracious liege,&rdquo;
  said Clavering. &ldquo;There is nothing unworthy in your meditated flight. On
  the contrary, it is a course of action dictated by prudence. If a chance
  remained of regaining your kingdom, I and your faithful liegemen would urge
  you to stay. But the moment is unpropitious, and you do wisely to withdraw
  till this terrible tempest now passing over the land shall have exhausted its
  fury. Leave your misguided and ungrateful subjects for a while to the care of
  the usurper Cromwell&mdash;they will soon be heartily sick of him, and eager
  to recally ou.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you say is true&mdash;perfectly true,&rdquo; replied Charles;
  &ldquo;I must go. Yet it is hard to fly from a kingdom, even when it is mine
  no longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your kingdom is not lost, my liege,&rdquo; cried Clavering.
  &ldquo;You design not to abdicate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles. &ldquo;I will sooner mount my
  murdered father&rsquo;s scaffold than do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am right in saying your kingdom is not lost, sire. A king is
  not the less a king because he can only rally round him a few faithful
  followers, Our spirit in time will animate others, and will catch and spread
  till the whole land is on fire. Treason and rebellion will be burned out, and
  your subjects eager to herald your return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust it may be so,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;Have any
  tidings been heard of the Earl of Derby? A court-martial hath sat upon him,
  as I am informed, by virtue of a commission from the arch-traitor Cromwell,
  and it hath, in violation of all laws of honourable warfare, since quarter
  was promised the earl on surrender, condemned him to death by the headsman.
  But his lordship hath since petitioned Cromwell, as I am told, for a
  remission of his sentence&mdash;with what result?&mdash;can any of ye tell
  me, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a profound silence. And Clavering and Colonel Gunter, on whom
  Charles fixed inquiring glances, cast down their eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your silence shows me that the petition has been
  ineffectual,&rdquo; continued the king. &ldquo;Not content with shedding the
  best blood of England, the murderous villain would pour out more. He would
  spare none of you if ye fell into his hands. O my valiant and chivalrous
  Derby, thou soul of honour and loyalty, and art thou to perish thus! When and
  where is the shameful deed to be done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow at noon at Bolton, in Lancashire, as I am informed, my
  liege,&rdquo; replied Clavering, to whom the question seemed to be
  addressed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow at noon&mdash;ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, sadly.
  &ldquo;Then one of the best and bravest spirits in England will wing its
  flight to purer spheres! Prepare yourselves to be astonished, gentlemen, by
  what I am about to relate. As I live and stand before you,&rdquo; he added,
  in a tone of so much solemnity that it struck awe in his hearers, &ldquo;I
  have been warned that Derby would die at the time you have
  mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I venture to ask your Majesty how you received the
  warning?&rdquo; said Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From the earl himself,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;You all stare
  and look incredulous. But it is so, unless I have conjured up a phantom from
  mine own imagination. I saw him the night before last at midnight&mdash;I saw
  him again last night. Nay, methought I beheld his shadowy figure, not long
  ago, in this very forest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here! in this forest, sire?&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Moving amidst the trees by my side,&rdquo; replied Charles.
  &ldquo;I beheld him quite plainly, though I mentioned not the
  circumstance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the apparition, if such it may be called, came to warn your
  Majesty, you say?&rdquo; cried Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The earl, or a spirit in his likeness, warned me,&rdquo; replied
  the king, &ldquo;that his execution would take place to-morrow&mdash;the
  truth of which sad intelligence you yourself have just confirmed&mdash;and
  the semblance of my gallant Derby added, that if I quitted not England before
  his head was laid upon the block, I should share the same fate as my martyred
  father. Hence my anxiety to set sail at daybreak to-morrow will be
  intelligible to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your haste and inquietude are now perfectly intelligible,
  sire,&rdquo; replied Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The circumstance is strange, and inexplicable even to
  myself,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;But it is best to accept such matters as
  they come, without seeking to examine them too closely. It may be a delusion,
  or it may be real, I cannot say which; but I shall act as if the warning had
  been given me by my beloved Derby in person. But I shall grow sad if I suffer
  my thoughts to dwell longer on this theme. Let us on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this, he put his steed once more in motion, and the little cavalcade
  proceeded in the same order and at the same pace as before. By pursuing the
  avenue to its full extent, the king would have been brought nearer Stanstead
  House than his conductors judged prudent. They therefore turned off on the
  left, and soon came to a more open part of the forest, where the timber,
  being scattered, attained larger growth. Here they encountered a woodman,
  with a hatchet over his shoulder, accompanied by a lad, and both stood still
  to gaze at the cavalcade; but on recognizing Colonel Gunter, who was known to
  him, the forester doffed his fur cap and went his way. Further on, they met a
  couple of huntsmen in Lord Lumley&rsquo;s livery, and these men likewise
  testified surprise on beholding the party. But again Colonel Gunter&rsquo;s
  presence prevented interruption.</p>

  <p>After quitting the forest and skirting Stanstead Park, the royal party
  pursued their way through a lovely and well-wooded district, until they came
  to the foot of an eminence called Bow Hill, and entered the narrow and
  picturesque vale denominated Kingly Bottom&mdash;so called from a battle
  between the inhabitants of Chichester and the Danes&mdash;and Charles failed
  not to notice the group of venerable yew-trees&mdash;venerable in his days,
  though still extant, with the trifle of two centuries added to their
  age&mdash;that adorn the valley. After this, they passed Stoke Down,
  bestowing a passing observation on the curious circular hollows indented in
  the sod.</p>

  <p>From the acclivities over which the travellers next rode the ancient and
  picturesque city of Chichester could be seen on the level land near the sea,
  the tall spire and pinnacles of its noble cathedral, the adjacent bell-tower,
  and the quaint old octagonal market-cross, erected in the fifteenth century,
  all rising above the crumbling walls still surrounding the city. As Charles
  looked towards this fine old cathedral, he could not help deploring to his
  companions the damage it had sustained at the hands of the sacrilegious
  Republican soldiers.</p>

  <p>Avoiding Chichester, the king and his company pursued their way along the
  beautiful and well-wooded slopes of the Goodwood downs. If the journey had
  been unattended with risk, it would have been delightful; but beset by peril
  as he was, on all sides, Charles did not lose his sense of enjoyment. The
  constant presence of danger had made him well-nigh indifferent to it.
  Constitutionally brave, almost reckless, he was assailed by no idle
  apprehensions. The chief maxim in his philosophy was to make the most of the
  passing moment, and not to let the chances of future misfortune damp present
  enjoyment.</p>

  <p>The fineness of the weather contributed materially to the pleasure of the
  ride. It was an exquisite morning, and the day promised to continue equally
  beautiful throughout. The trees were clothed with the glowing livery of later
  autumn, and as the whole district was well and variously wooded, there was
  every variety of shade in the foliage still left, from bright yellow to
  deepest red. Corn was then, as now, extensively grown in the broad and
  fertile fields in the flat land nearer the sea, but the crops had been
  gathered, and the fields were for the most part covered with stubble. The
  prospect offered to the king, as he looked towards the coast, was varied and
  extensive. On the left, the ancient mansion of Halnaker, now in ruins, but at
  that time presenting a goodly specimen of the Tudor era of architecture,
  seemed to invite him to halt; and Colonel Gunter informed his Majesty that
  over the buttery hatch in this old house were scrolls hospitably entreating
  visitors to &ldquo;come in and drink,&rdquo; assuring them they would be
  &ldquo;les bien-venus.&rdquo; Notwithstanding these inducements to tarry,
  Charles rode on, galloping along the fine avenue of chestnut-trees, the
  fallen leaves of which now thickly strewed the ground.</p>

  <p>Halnaker was soon left behind, and ere long the somewhat devious course of
  the royal party led them through the exquisite grove of beech-trees skirting
  Slindon Park, the remarkable beauty of the timber eliciting the warm
  admiration of the king, who would fain have loitered to admire it at his
  leisure.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch8-3"
     name="ch8-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  An Encounter With The Governor Of Arundel Castle</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE proud-looking castle of Arundel was now visible,
  magnificently situated on the terrace of a hill, surrounded by noble woods,
  above which towered the ancient central keep. From the spot where the royal
  party surveyed. it, about two miles off, the stately edifice looked the
  picture of feudal grandeur, but a nearer approach showed how grievously it
  had been injured. At the outbreak of the Great Rebellion Arundel Castle fell
  into the hands of the Parliamentary forces, but surrendered to Lord Hopton in
  1643. It did not, however, remain long in the possession of the Royalists,
  being retaken within two months, after a siege of seventeen days, by Sir
  William Waller, when a thousand prisoners were made by the victorious party.
  The castle was then plundered and partly destroyed, and great ravages
  committed in the ancient and beautiful church of Saint Nicholas, contiguous
  to it. At the time of our story it was occupied as a garrison by the
  Parliamentary troops, the command of the castle, with the title of governor,
  having been very recently accorded to Colonel Morley, a Republican officer of
  great strictness and severity. Though the interior of the ancient and stately
  fabric was mutilated and destroyed, though the carved tombs and monuments,
  stone pulpit, arches, altars, delicate tracery, and exquisite architectural
  ornaments of the church were defaced, though much of the fine timber growing
  near the fortress was remorselessly hewn down, the defences of the castle
  were still maintained, and it was even then looked upon as a place of
  considerable strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was with Lord Hopton when he took yon fortress in
  &lsquo;43,&rdquo; observed Colonel Gunter to the king. &ldquo;The rascals
  surrendered on the first summons, and saved us the trouble of a siege. But it
  cost Waller seventeen days of good hard work to get it back again. The rogues
  have done as much mischief as they can both to castle and church. We must,
  perforce, pass through the town, as we shall to cross the Arun by the
  bridge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charles made no objection, and the party rode on until they reached the
  hill on which the proud fortress is planted. They were mounting the ascent
  somewhat leisurely, when the merry notes of a hunting-horn greeted their
  ears, and the next moment a company of wellnigh a dozen horsemen, with a pack
  of hounds, appeared at the top of the hill. From the buff coats, boots, and
  other habiliments worn by these horsemen, it was evident that they were
  troopers from the castle going forth to indulge in the pastime of hunting,
  but though for the convenience of the chase they had laid aside their swords,
  carabines, and heavy steel accoutrements, they had still bandoleers over
  their shoulders, and pistols in their holsters. In this troop one person was
  a little in advance of the others, and it was evident from the superiority of
  his attire, as well as from the deference shown him, that he was higher in
  station than his companions. The individual in question was no other than the
  newly-appointed governor of Arundel Castle. Colonel Morley was a tall,
  raw-boned personage, with broad cheeks and flat nose, and the truculence of
  his looks was not diminished by a long pair of starched moustaches, which
  projected, like the whiskers of a tiger, from his face. Colonel Gunter
  instantly recognised him, and informing the king who was coming towards them,
  asked if his Majesty preferred to turn aside?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;That would excite
  instant suspicion. Colonel Morley has seen us. Go boldly on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two parties now rapidly approached each other. The Royalists displayed
  great nerve, and did not flinch from the encounter. Colonel Morley eyed the
  troop advancing towards him sharply and suspiciously. He allowed them to
  approach quite close without question, but just as they were about to pass he
  called out to them, in an authoritative tone, to stay.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And whither go
  ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are from Chichester, worshipful sir, of which city I am
  mayor,&rdquo; replied Colonel Gunter, &ldquo;on our way to Steyning, to
  attend the marriage of a cousin of mine, a very comely damsel, who is to be
  wedded this day to an elder of that town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The governor took little notice of the reply, but looking fixedly at the
  king, said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou, friend? Thy face seems familiar to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very like it may be, worshipful sir, if you have ever visited
  Chichester,&rdquo; replied Charles, without betraying the slightest
  confusion. &ldquo;I am an alderman and maltster of the city, by name William
  Jackson. You have heard of me, I doubt not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say that I have, but then I have recently arrived
  here,&rdquo; replied the governor of the castle, to whom the answers appeared
  satisfactory. &ldquo;Pass on your way, Mr. Mayor, and you, good master
  alderman, and take my best wishes for the happiness of the bride, especially
  if she be as comely as ye represent her. And harkye, one of my men shall go
  with you, and see you safely through the town, or, peradventure, ye may be
  hindered. Go with them, Corporal Gird-the- Loins Grimbald.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The pretended mayor of Chichester thanked the governor of Arundel Castle
  for his courtesy, after which the Royalist party, attended by Corporal
  Grimbald, a very grim-looking corporal indeed, set off in one direction,
  while Colonel Morley, winding his horn to call the hounds together, rode off
  in another, followed by the troopers. The royal party soon afterwards entered
  Arundel, and it was fortunate that they had the grim-visaged corporal with
  them, for the town proved to be full of soldiers. Many of these glanced
  inquisitively at the travellers, but, seeing Grimbald, concluded all must be
  right. A nearer inspection of the castle showed the extent of the damage done
  to it by the Parliamentary soldiers. Sentinels fully accoutred, and armed
  with carabines, were posted at the gates of the fortress, and within the
  base-court could be seen other men drawn up, and going through their
  exercise. Our party, however, pushed on, and made for the bridge, where
  Corporal Gird-the-Loins Grimbald quitted them.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch8-4"
     name="ch8-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  The Blacksmith Of Angmering</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HAVING crossed the narrow but rushing Arun, the travellers
  now pursued their way along a winding lane, bordered in many places by fine
  trees, and enjoying glimpses of delicious woodland scenery. As they
  approached Angmering, it was discovered that the king&rsquo;s horse had lost
  a shoe. At first, it was feared that the loss could not be remedied at any
  place nearer than Steyning, but luckily a little smithy was found on the
  skirts of Angmering Park, while a small wayside inn, very pleasantly situated
  in the midst of some fine elm trees, offered them the refreshment they so
  much needed, both for themselves and their steeds. Since quitting Stanstead
  Forest they had now ridden upwards of twenty miles, the king and those with
  him having previously ridden ten miles from Hambledon. All the party were as
  hungry as hunters. Charles declared he felt absolutely voracious, and
  directed Colonel Gunter to order the best breakfast that could be provided at
  the little inn, while he himself got his horse shod.</p>

  <p>The blacksmith, a shrewd-looking fellow, lifted up the horse&rsquo;s feet
  deliberately, and then, with rather a singular look, remarked,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, master, how comes this? Your horse has but three shoes left,
  and all three were put on in different counties; and one in
  Worcestershire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are right, friend,&rdquo; replied Charles, laughing.
  &ldquo;This horse was ridden at the fight at Worcester. I bought him from a
  disbanded Cavalier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, he shall have an honest Roundhead shoe this time, I can
  promise you, master,&rdquo; cried the blacksmith, plying his bellows, and
  soon afterwards placing a glowing shoe on the anvil. &ldquo;I should like to
  belabour all Royalists in this fashion,&rdquo; he added, as he struck the
  heated iron.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! would you serve Charles Stuart himself so?&rdquo; demanded
  Charles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, marry, him worse than any other,&rdquo; replied the blacksmith,
  with a blow that made the anvil ring. &ldquo;I heard say at Arundel that the
  Young Man has been taken, and I hope it be true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, one thing is quite certain, thou wouldst never lend him a
  hand to escape,&rdquo; observed Charles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, nor a shoe, nor a nail,&rdquo; replied the smith.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d lame his horse, if he brought him to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t lame mine, friend, I prithee,&rdquo; said
  Charles. &ldquo;Take him to the stable, and see him well fed when thou hast
  done. I must in to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The blacksmith promising compliance, Charles entered the little inn, where
  he found his companions seated at a table, with a goodly loaf of bread, a
  half- consumed cheese, and a lump of butter before them, together with two
  capacious jugs filled with ale, and drinking-horns. They did not rise, of
  course, on his Majesty&rsquo;s appearance, but he took the place reserved for
  him between Clavering and Lord Wilmot. Charles was scarcely seated when a
  large dish of fried ham and eggs was placed upon the table by a
  comely-looking damsel. A second supply was ordered to be prepared, and the
  king and his hungry followers did ample justice to the repast.</p>

  <p>Having pretty nearly cleared the board and quite emptied both jugs of
  their contents, the party arose, and called for the reckoning, which was
  moderate enough, as may be supposed. Colonel Gunter defrayed it, while the
  others went forth to look after their steeds. The blacksmith had charge of
  the king&rsquo;s horse, and in return for the half-crown which Charles
  bestowed upon him, wished the young monarch a prosperous journey, adding,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s more than I would wish Charles Stuart. But talking
  of the Young Man, master, what manner of man is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A marvellous proper man,&rdquo; replied the king;
  &ldquo;about&rdquo; a foot taller than myself, very broad across the
  shoulders, fair-haired&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, that can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; exclaimed the blacksmith,
  &ldquo;for I have heard tell that he is as dark as a gipsy. I should say he
  was more like your honour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How now, sirrah! hast thou the impudence to tell me to my face that
  I am like Charles Stuart?&rdquo; cried the king, with affected wrath.
  &ldquo;I have half a mind to chastise thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I meant no offence,&rdquo; replied the smith. &ldquo;The
  devil, they say, is not so black as he&rsquo;s painted, and a man may be
  swart as a gipsy and yet handsome for all that. Handsome is that handsome
  does, and your honour having paid me handsomely, I wish you a prosperous
  journey. Good luck attend you wherever you go!&rdquo; So saying, he retired
  into his smithy.</p>

  <p>By this time all the party having mounted, they again set forth on their
  way.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-5"
     name="ch8-5">CHAPTER V<br>
  The Patriarch Of The Downs</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ANGMERING PARK, through a portion of which the royal party
  now rode, possessed many points of great beauty, and boasted much noble
  timber. In especial, there was a fine grove of oaks, old as the Druids, and
  tenanted at that time by a colony of herons; the birds, or their progeny,
  having since migrated to Parham. Charles cast a passing glance at the
  long-legged, long-necked birds congregated on the higher branches of the
  trees, and listened for a moment to their harsh cries. Quitting Angmering
  Park, and approaching Clapham Wood through a beautiful sylvan district, the
  party now obtained a fine view of Highdown Hill, on the summit of which, in
  later years, has been placed the Miller&rsquo;s Tomb.</p>

  <p>From ClaphamWood the travellers made their way towards Findon, proceeding
  along the valley at the base of Cissbury Hill, a noble down, boasting, like
  so many of its neighbouring eminences, a large encampment, and commanding
  extensive views both of sea and land. Mounting the western slope of down in
  order to enjoy the prospect, the troop presently came to some circular
  hollows similar to those which they had previously passed at Stoke Down.</p>

  <p>In one of these cavities a little hut had been constructed. On a wooden
  bench in front of the lowly habitation sat a venerable figure, which
  irresistibly attracted the king&rsquo;s attention, and arrested his progress.
  The personage seemed to be of an age almost patriarchal, to judge from his
  hoary locks and long silvery beard. Originally, he must have been of lofty
  stature, but his frame was bent by the weight of years, and his limbs
  shrunken. His head was uncovered, and his brow and features ploughed deeply
  with wrinkles. His garb was that of a common shepherd of the downs. At his
  feet lay a dog, whose appearance was almost as antiquated as that of his
  master. On the bench near this patriarch of the hills sat a little girl, who
  was reading the Bible to him.</p>

  <p>Perceiving from the king&rsquo;s looks that he desired to know something
  concerning this venerable personage, Colonel Gunter informed his Majesty that
  the name of the shepherd was Oswald Barcombe. He was what in popular parlance
  was called a &ldquo;wise man,&rdquo; and had had plenty of time to acquire
  wisdom, for his life had extended far beyond the limits ordinarily allotted
  to man. For some time&mdash;almost beyond the memory of the existing
  generation&mdash;he had inhabited that hollow, and had scooped out a cave in
  the chalk, with which the hut communicated.</p>

  <p>These particulars, combined with the old shepherd&rsquo;s venerable and
  patriarchal appearance, interested Charles so much that he alighted, and
  committing his horse to Clavering, advanced alone towards the cavity in the
  midst of which the old man was seated. Perceiving the stranger approach, the
  little girl left off reading, and pulled the old man by the sleeve to make
  him aware that some one was at hand. Thus admonished, the patriarch raised
  his head, and fixed his dim, almost sightless orbs on the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou that seekest the dwelling of old Oswald
  Barcombe?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A wanderer, without home or name,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;A
  price is set upon my head, and I am flying from a country which I can no more
  call mine own. Yet, looking upon thee, old man, I could not pass thy dwelling
  without craving thy blessing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou shalt have my blessing and welcome, my son,&rdquo; replied the
  venerable shepherd; &ldquo;and I trust it may profit thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me thy age, I prithee, father?&rdquo; said the king.
  &ldquo;Thou must have seen many years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many, many years, my son. A hundred and ten, as far as I can
  reckon. It may be a year more, or a year less, for I have wellnigh lost the
  count. Many changes have I seen as well as years. When I was a lad, bluff
  Harry the Eighth ruled the land, and I lived through the reigns of all his
  children. They were a royal race, those Tudors. The Stuarts came next, and I
  saw them both out, father and son, though good King Charles might have been
  on the throne now, if his enemies had not done him to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou sayest truly, old man,&rdquo; replied Charles.
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a deed of which a terrible account will be required of the
  parricides hereafter, should they even escape earthly punishment. But I
  honour thee for thy courage, old friend. Few men there are&mdash;whatever
  their secret sentiments may be&mdash;bold enough, now-a-days, to couple the
  epithet &lsquo;good&rsquo; with the name of Charles the First.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Charles the First was a good king, and I will maintain
  it,&rdquo; replied Oswald. &ldquo;I am too old to be a Republican. Go into
  the cave, my child, and tarry there till I call thee forth. I have a word to
  say in private to this stranger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And as the girl departed on the old man&rsquo;s behest, Charles inquired,
  with some curiosity, if the little maid was his granddaughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She belongs to the fourth generation,&rdquo; replied the old
  shepherd. &ldquo;Edith is my great-grandson&rsquo;s daughter. But now that
  she is gone, I will speak to thee plainly. Thou hast intimated to me that
  thou art a fugitive Royalist. I cannot give thee shelter, but I can offer
  thee sympathy. I love not the present state of things. Night and day do I
  pray for the young king&rsquo;s safety, and for his restoration to the throne
  of his ancestors. In all likelihood I am the oldest man in the land, and
  Heaven will listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Say&rsquo;st thou so, father?&rdquo; cried Charles; &ldquo;then the
  king might trust his life to thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is the king on these hills?&rdquo; demanded the old shepherd,
  trembling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He stands before thee!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles. &ldquo;Nay, he
  kneels to thee&mdash;implores thy blessing. Thou wilt not withhold it,
  father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mastering his astonishment by a marvellous effort, with a dignity which
  nothing but extreme age could impart, and with an expression of countenance
  almost sublime, the patriarch spread his arms over the head of the kneeling
  monarch, and in a tone of the utmost solemnity and fervour pronounced a
  benediction upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feel that this blessing from one who, like thyself, has outlived
  all earthly passions, will indeed profit me,&rdquo; said Charles, rising.
  &ldquo;I am compelled to fly from my kingdom, but I shall return to it ere
  long, and trust to find thee living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so, sire,&rdquo; replied old Oswald; &ldquo;my sand is nearly
  run. You will reascend the throne&mdash;of that I am well assured&mdash;but
  ere that happy event occurs, the old shepherd of Cissbury Hill will be laid
  in the grave already digged for him in this hollow. But while life remains he
  will not cease to pray for your restoration. Yet take counsel from me,
  sire,&rdquo; the old man continued, in a slightly troubled tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dream dreams, and behold visions. I have watched the stars on
  many a night from this hill-top, and have learnt strange lore from the
  heavenly bodies. To- day you are in safety, but be not found within this
  rebellious land to- morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I design not to be so,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;Fare thee
  well, father!&rdquo; And he extended his hand to the patriarch, who pressed
  it reverently to his lips. &ldquo;Give this to little Edith,&rdquo; added
  Charles, placing a piece of gold in the old man&rsquo;s palm. &ldquo;Once
  more, farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He then ran quickly up the side of the little hollow, mounted his horse,
  and rode off, remaining silent and abstracted for some time, much to the
  disappointment of his escort, who were curious to learn what had passed
  between him and the old shepherd of Cissbury Hill.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-6"
     name="ch8-6">CHAPTER VI<br>
  What Happened At The &ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; At Steyning</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LEAVING Findon to the left, the travellers next crossed the
  range of hills, of which the lofty headland known as Chanctonbury Ring is the
  termination on the north-west, and descended upon Steyning. It had been their
  intention to push on to Bramber, but on entering the town they accidentally
  learnt that a troop of horse had just ridden off in that direction, so they
  judged it best to make a brief halt lest they should overtake them. Riding
  into the yard of the White Horse, they dismounted, and ordered their horses
  to be taken to the stables. There were a good many persons in the yard at the
  time, and amongst them were two individuals, who, despite their threadbare
  apparel, gave themselves great airs, strutted about like well-clad gallants,
  pounding the earth with their heavy-heeled boots, and making their long
  rapiers clatter against the stones. These two personages, who were no other
  than the redoubted Captain Goldspur and his friend Jervoise Rumboldsdyke, had
  watched the arrival of the party with some curiosity, and as Charles was
  about to enter the house, the captain strode up to him, and said, in a low,
  significant tone, &ldquo;Art thou a friend to Csar?&rdquo; And then, without
  waiting for a reply, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, zounds! can it be?&mdash;it
  is&mdash;it is Csar himself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be silent, sir !&mdash;I charge you on your allegiance,&rdquo; said
  Charles, authoritatively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am dumb, sire,&rdquo; replied Goldspur, respectfully. &ldquo;But
  I pray your Majesty to believe that my sword, my life, are at your
  disposal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rumboldsdyke coming up at the moment, his friend whispered a word to him,
  which instantly produced a magical effect upon the ruffling blade, whose
  demeanour became as respectful as that of Goldspur.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Master Jervoise Rumboldsdyke, an it please your
  Majesty,&rdquo; said Goldspur, in a low tone. &ldquo;Like myself, he hath
  lost his fortune in your service. But what matters that? We would lose fifty
  fortunes&mdash;if we had them&mdash;in such a cause&mdash;and our lives into
  the bargain. Would we not, Rumboldsdyke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, that would we!&rdquo; exclaimed the other ruffler.</p>

  <p>Charles would have gladly dispensed both with the presence and professions
  of such suspicious adherents, but fearing some indiscretion on their part, he
  deemed it best to keep them in sight, and therefore invited them to enter the
  house, and drink a bottle of canary with him&mdash;an invitation which, as
  may be supposed, they gratefully accepted.</p>

  <p>Charles found Colonel Gunter waiting for him just within the doorway, and
  the latter looked surprised and somewhat uneasy at perceiving his Majesty
  attended by the two threadbare Cavaliers. A glance from the king, however,
  reassured him, and on looking more narrowly at the persons with him, he
  remembered to have seen them amongst the guests at the Poynings&rsquo; Arms
  on the night when he was taken there by Stelfax, after his descent of the
  declivity near the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke. Goldspur, however, sought to set him
  completely at ease by stepping up to him, and saying in his ear,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is all right, Colonel Gunter. We are both friends to
  Csar&mdash;both men of honesty and mettle. Do you not remember the night at
  the Poynings&rsquo; Arms, when that rascally Ironside captain brought you a
  prisoner there? Do you not recollect Captain Goldspur and his friend Jervoise
  Rumboldsdyke? I made an effort for your liberation. A shot was fired from
  Patcham Wood: &lsquo;twas I who sent the bullet at the accursed
  Stelfax!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough! enough! Captain Goldspur. I remember you perfectly,&rdquo;
  replied Gunter, hastily. &ldquo;But come into this private room. We shall be
  more at our ease there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, he led the way into a parlour looking towards the back of the
  house. Charles had already preceded him, and having hastily apprised the
  others of the addition they might expect to their party, they were prepared
  for the appearance of the two rufflers. Glasses and a couple of flasks of
  canary had already been placed on the table, so there was no present occasion
  to summon the host; and Gunter, having closed the door in order to prevent
  intrusion, proceeded to introduce the new comers, whom he described as men
  who would not stick at a trifle to serve their friends.</p>

  <p>The introduction over, Lord Wilmot, in a haughty tone, thus addressed
  them:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harkye, Captain Goldspur, and you, Master Rumboldsdyke&mdash;since
  such are the names you choose to go by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go by&rsquo;&mdash;was that the word?&rdquo; interrupted
  Goldspur, indignantly. &ldquo;They are as much our names, my lord, as Henry
  Wilmot, Baron Wilmot in England, and Viscount Wilmot in Ireland, is your
  own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish, my lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, laughing, &ldquo;you
  are known to these gentlemen, it seems, as well as we ourselves appear to
  be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It were needless to remind his lordship where we have had the
  honour of meeting him,&rdquo; observed Goldspur. &ldquo;But if he desires it,
  I will mention&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, it is needless to enter into particulars,&rdquo; cried Lord
  Wilmot. &ldquo;I fancy I have seen your faces before, but not under very
  creditable circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your lordship does not mean to cast any reflections upon our
  honour, I trust?&rdquo; said Goldspur, frowning, and laying his hand upon the
  hilt of his blade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not in the least, captain,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot, calmly.
  &ldquo;I have no doubt you are both men of honour, according to your own
  acceptation of the term. But I was about to observe, when you first
  interrupted me, that you have chosen to force your company upon
  us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Force, my lord!&rdquo; cried Goldspur, indignantly. &ldquo;Neither
  Master Rumboldsdyke nor myself desire to force our company upon any man. We
  sought only to offer our swords and our lives to our gracious master. We
  yield to no man living&mdash;not even to yourself, Lord Wilmot&mdash;in
  devotion to the king, and we are ready to approve it. We may have tarnished
  cloaks and threadbare jerkins, but we have loyal hearts in our
  breasts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe you, gentlemen&mdash;I believe you,&rdquo; replied the
  king. &ldquo;Wilmot, thou art wrong in doubting these good
  fellows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope I am,&rdquo; replied his lordship; &ldquo;but I must be
  permitted to observe, that if I perceive the slightest indication of
  treachery on their part, I shall not hesitate to shoot both of them through
  the head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If his Majesty is satisfied with our professions we are
  content,&rdquo; said Goldspur.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And so I am,&rdquo; replied the king&mdash;&rdquo; though it will
  be needful to keep a wary eye upon them,&rdquo; he muttered to himself.
  &ldquo;Sit down, gentlemen. Stand not upon ceremony with me, but fill your
  glasses to the brim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine shall be emptied to a pledge that I drink daily,&rdquo; quoth
  Goldspur. May the king enjoy his own again, and that right speedily!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I echo the sentiment!&rdquo; added Rumboldsdyke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you both for this display of your loyalty and
  attachment,&rdquo; said Charles; &ldquo;but I must pray you to be prudent,
  and make no further demonstration of your zeal. We are bound to Bramber, and
  perhaps to Brightelmstone. Is there any danger on the way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A troop of horse has just gone on to Shoreham, sire,&rdquo; said
  Goldspur. &ldquo;But they will have passed through Bramber before you get
  there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you tell us aught of Stelfax, Captain Goldspur?&rdquo; inquired
  Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The detested dog is still at Lewes,&rdquo; replied the other,
  &ldquo;and is constantly occupied in scouring the country, and searching
  houses for fugitive Cavaliers. It is not for me to inquire into his
  Majesty&rsquo;s plans, but if they are such as to require the service of
  scouts upon the motions of the enemy, so as to give timely notice of danger,
  I and Master Rumboldsdyke will be ready to perform the office, and we have
  companions who will lend us aid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May it not be advisable to employ these men as scouts?&rdquo; said
  Charles, in a low tone to Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think so, most undoubtedly,&rdquo; the young man replied.
  &ldquo;Hark ye, Captain Goldspur,&rdquo; he continued aloud, &ldquo;his
  Majesty thinks well of your proposal. You and your friend, I presume, are
  provided with horses. Ride to Lewes, or the neighbourhood, with all possible
  dispatch. Station your scouts about Southover, and about the western side of
  the town, and if any sudden movements are made this evening by Stelfax, or
  the Ironsides, give us immediate warning at my father&rsquo;s residence,
  Ovingdean Grange. You know the way to it, I make no doubt, across the
  downs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will not be the first time that I and Master Rumboldsdyke have
  visited Ovingdean Grange,&rdquo; replied Goldspur. &ldquo;We have recently
  become acquainted with your worthy father, Colonel Maunsel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering in surprise</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I may add,&rdquo; pursued Goldspur, &ldquo;we have served him
  in the capacity we are about to serve his Majesty; we have acted as his
  scouts upon the detested Stelfax. Nay, more, we have watched over Mock-Beggar
  Hall, where worthy Master Beard and his daughter, the lovely Mistress Dulcia,
  were lodged during their stay at Lewes, and we escorted them back to the
  Grange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you tell me, captain, satisfies me that you may indeed be
  trusted,&rdquo; said Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, it seems we have stumbled on the very men we needed,&rdquo;
  observed Charles. &ldquo;But who is this lovely Mistress Dulcia Beard they
  have guarded?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The daughter of my father&rsquo;s chaplain. Your Majesty will
  behold her at Ovingdean Grange,&rdquo; replied Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And shall find her, no doubt, well worthy our regard,&rdquo;
  replied the king, noticing the young man&rsquo;s heightened colour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have we your Majesty&rsquo;s commands to set forward to Lewes on
  this service?&rdquo; demanded Goldspur.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have, sir,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;And we pray you to
  lose no time by the way. If there should be danger, you will not fail to make
  it known to Colonel Maunsel, at Ovingdean Grange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On that your Majesty may rely. We now humbly take our leave.&rdquo;
  On this the twain made a profound obeisance and departed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your Majesty is of opinion that these fellows may be
  trusted?&rdquo; observed Lord Wilmot, as soon as they were gone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am convinced of it,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;I have not the
  slightest misgiving as to their fidelity. Nay, I think it very lucky we
  encountered them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope it may turn out as you anticipate,&rdquo; said Lord Wilmot;
  &ldquo;but I am not without fears to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art always full of apprehension, Wilmot,&rdquo; said the king.
  &ldquo;I never allow fears to disturb me. Give me another glass of canary.
  Here is to fair Mistress Dulcia Beard!&rdquo; he added, with a smile at
  Clavering. &ldquo;You must tell me more about her as we ride on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charles and his companions remained for about a quarter of an hour longer
  in the parlour. They then summoned the host, paid their shot, and called for
  their horses. As the street near the inn seemed to be rather full of people,
  and some one amongst them might possibly recognize the royal fugitive, it was
  agreed that his Majesty&rsquo;s horse should be led to the outskirts of the
  town, on the road to Bramber, where he could join them.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, while the others were engaged with the ostler, Charles
  slipped away, and proceeding along the street in which stands the curious old
  gabled house called the Brotherhood Hall, even then used as a grammar school,
  soon reached the antique church, built on the site of the still older wooden
  fabric constructed by Saint Cuthman, of whom mention has been made in an
  earlier portion of our Tale.</p>

  <p>Having lingered near this old pile for a few minutes, without bestowing
  many thoughts, we fear, upon good Saint Cuthman, Charles set off again, and
  marching at a quick pace was presently out of the town, and at the spot where
  his attendants were waiting for him. Here he mounted his horse, and the troop
  set off for Bramber, the woody mound upon which the ruins of the old Norman
  castle are situated rising majestically before them at the distance of less
  than a mile.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-7"
     name="ch8-7">CHAPTER VII<br>
  Ditchling Beacon</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE royal wanderer, now approaching the ancient stronghold
  of the Braoses, had neither leisure nor inclination to mount the woody side
  of the eminence and examine the shattered fragment of its keep, supposed to
  have been demolished by gunpowder, but was. fain to content himself with such
  view as the road afforded of the picturesque ruins of the castle, and the
  venerable church of Saint Nicholas nestling under its grey and crumbling
  walls. Charles, however, was much amused by the diminutive size and quaint
  architecture of the habitations composing the little village of Bramher, many
  of which were so low that a tall man could look in at their upper windows.
  Several of these curious old houses, which were built towards the latter end
  of the sixteenth century, are still left, and a very good notion of an
  English village in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time may be formed by a visit to
  Bramber. The king&rsquo;s advance-guard ascertained, greatly to their
  satisfaction, that the troop of Republican soldiers had gone on to Shoreham;
  and as Charles crossed the little bridge over the Adur, he could see the long
  line of red coats, distinguishable by their glittering casques and corslets,
  passing on the left bank of the river on their way thither. Under ordinary
  circumstances the royal party would have taken the same route; but even if
  they had intended it, the hostile force in advance would have deterred them
  from proceeding in that direction. They now proposed to continue their
  journey along a little-frequented road, leading from the defile of the Adur
  to Poynings, and running at the foot of the precipitous range of downs
  overlooking the Weald of Sussex.</p>

  <p>Here it was that Colonel Gunter, and his kinsman the captain, took leave
  of the king for a while, and struck off along the uplands on the east bank of
  the Adur, in the direction of Shoreham, it being the colonel&rsquo;s
  intention to seek an interview with Captain Tattersall, and ensure, at any
  cost, the skipper&rsquo;s departure before daybreak. The colonel set out to
  his expedition, full of confidence that he should be at Ovingdean Grange
  almost as soon as the king himself, and should bring his Majesty word that
  all had been satisfactorily settled. While, therefore, Charles and his now
  diminished escort rode in one direction, Colonel Gunter and his kinsman set
  off in another; the latter shaping their course towards Shoreham, but keeping
  on the acclivities, in order to avoid the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Charles and his party, who were now under the guidance of
  Clavering, crossed the spur of a down extending into the mighty fissure
  through which the Adur finds it way to the sea, and then look their way along
  the foot of the lofty escarpment to the picturesque village of Poynings,
  which we have visited on a former occasion. On the road to Poynings the king
  failed not to question Clavering as to the state of his feelings in respect
  to Dulcia Beard, and having ascertained, beyond a doubt, that the young
  man&rsquo;s affections were irrevocably fixed upon the damsel, he promised to
  exert all his influence with Colonel Maunsel to induce him to assent to the
  match.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I will lose no time about it,&rdquo; added the good-natured
  monarch. &ldquo;I will attack the old gentleman on the subject immediately on
  my arrival at the Grange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At Poynings the king did not fail to admire the beautiful old church, and
  the ancient manor-house amidst its woods; neither did he neglect to take a
  deep draught of Simon Piddinghoe&rsquo;s stout March ale, a black jack,
  filled to the brim with the excellent beverage, being brought to the door of
  the hostel by the officious landlord, at Clavering&rsquo;s directions.
  Neither did his Majesty escape without a brief chat with the talkative
  schoolmaster, Cisbury Oldfirle, who came forth with his pipe in one hand and
  a jug of ale in the other, to have a word with the strangers, and who,
  thinking that the king looked the most good- humoured person of the party,
  took the liberty of addressing him. The record of their conversation,
  however, has not been preserved.</p>

  <p>Quitting Poynings, the royal party rode off, and proceeded at a rapid trot
  along a pleasant shady lane bordered by trees, whose branches often overhung
  it, until they came to the foot of Wolstonbury Hill, one of the most
  beautiful of the South Downs, which rose smoothly and gently before them, as
  if inviting them to ascend to the encampment upon its brow. They did, indeed,
  mount so far upon the velvet sward of the hill as enabled them to survey the
  surrounding district. From the elevated point they had now reached they
  overlooked Danny Park, which then contained, and still boasts, many
  magnificent oaks, and other fine timber. Embosomed in the midst of these
  woods stood an ancient Elizabethan mansion&mdash;yet maintained in all its
  integrity. Further on, at the outskirts of the park, could be discerned the
  pretty little hamlet of Hurstpierrepoint, with its church, then a very
  secluded village indeed, but now, owing to the convenience of railways, the
  natural beauty of the spot, and the predilection of the inhabitants of
  Brighton for it, promising to become a considerable place. For a few minutes
  Charles suffered his gaze to wander over this fair sylvan scene, and then
  gave the word to his attendants to proceed.</p>

  <p>Hereupon Clavering, on whom, as we have said, the conduct of the troop now
  devolved, descended to the plain, and still keeping at the foot of the downs,
  crossed that part of the country now traversed by the railway, and pushed on
  till he came nearly to the foot of the lofty eminence on which Ditchling
  Beacon is situated.</p>

  <p>Here the travellers climbed the downs, and soon gained the summit of this
  majestic hill&mdash;the loftiest point amid the South Downs. Within a short
  distance of the beacon the king halted, in order to enjoy the magnificent
  prospect. Almost the whole of Sussex now lay before him, and after gazing at
  the vast panorama for some minutes in silence, he observed, with a sigh, deep
  almost as that heaved by the Moorish king when looking back on his lost
  Granada,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When shall I gaze upon this splendid prospect again? when shall I
  call this fair country mine? Heaven only knows!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The day will come, doubt it not, sire,&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering,
  &ldquo;and I hope to bring you again to Ditchling Beacon, and remind you of
  my words! But now let us on. We are nearly at our journey&rsquo;s
  end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you are impatient, no doubt, that I should settle the business
  with your father,&rdquo; replied Charles, with a sudden change of manner.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy. Fair Mistress Dulcia, shall be
  yours!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They now set forward at a quick trot, shaping their course in a south-
  easterly direction across the downs, and made such good progress, that in
  less than half an hour they had gained the northern extremity of the White
  Hawk Hill, and were within a mile of their destination. No sooner had they
  reached this point, than a man started from out a patch of gorse amidst which
  he had been lying, and ran towards them. It was Ninian Saxby.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is all right?&rdquo; demanded the king. &ldquo;May we safely
  approach the Grange?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With perfect safety, my liege,&rdquo; replied Ninian, doffing his
  cap. &ldquo;No danger whatever to be apprehended, and the colonel is out of
  measure delighted at the honour intended him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The little cavalcade was now once more in motion, and rode on till they
  came to the ancient barrow at the summit of the hill, at the rear of the
  mansion, where they found another person stationed. This was Eustace Saxby,
  and he corroborated his son&rsquo;s information that all was right.</p>

  <p>Here the party dismounted, and committing their horses to the two men, who
  were to take them round the back of the holt to the stables, they descended
  the hill, the king walking by the side of Clavering.</p>

  <p>In the course of their descent of the hill they had to pass a small
  cottage, somewhat retired from the road, and shaded by an elmtree. This
  cottage, which stood opposite the north garden-wall of the Grange, belonged
  to Morefruit Stone, the Puritan. Within it, at this moment, were two other
  persons besides old Morefruit and his daughter, who had witnessed, with great
  surprise, and even consternation, the arrival of the royal party on the
  hill-top. Keeping themselves carefully out of sight, these individuals
  watched Clavering and his royal companion as they descended the hill
  together, and on beholding the king, who accidentally made a pause near the
  cottage, one of the spies&mdash;evidently from his garb an officer in the
  Republican army&mdash;exclaimed, in a stern, wrathful tone to the other,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is he! it is Charles Stuart himself! He has come before his
  time. Thou hast deceived me, or hast given him warning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not deceived thee, Captain Stelfax,&rdquo; rejoined
  Mickle-gift; &ldquo;neither am I to blame if Charles Stuart has advanced the
  hour of his arrival.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he finds me wholly unprepared?&rdquo; cried Stelfax, in a tone
  of fierce disappointment. &ldquo;I shall lose him, unless he tarries for the
  night in the dwelling of this old Amalekite. My men are all at Lewes. What is
  to be done? I shall be balked of my prey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is yet a means of accomplishing his capture, if thou darest
  attempt it, single-handed,&rdquo; replied Micklegift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is there I dare not do?&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax. &ldquo;Show
  me thy plan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; answered Micklegift. &ldquo;I will introduce
  thee secretly to the house&mdash;into the sleeping-chamber of the old
  Amalekite. We shall not be noticed, for all the household will be occupied
  with the arrival of this company. Peradventure thou mayst be able to seize
  the Young Man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will seize him, or slay him, and take my chance for the
  rest,&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax, in a determined voice. &ldquo;Look forth, I
  prithee,&rdquo; he added to Morefruit Stone, &ldquo;and see if they be
  gone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one is in sight,&rdquo; replied the elder, looking forth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay thou within thy cottage,&rdquo; said Stelfax. &ldquo;We may
  need thee anon. Make good thy words,&rdquo; he added to Micklegift,
  &ldquo;and conduct me to Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s chamber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On this they quitted the cottage together, and taking a few steps up the
  hill, reached the door in the wall, which Micklegift unlocked. They then went
  into the garden.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-8"
     name="ch8-8">CHAPTER VIII<br>
  Of The King&rsquo;s Reception At The Grange</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON approaching the front of the mansion, Clavering besought
  the king&rsquo;s permission to step forward, and receiving it, hastened to
  ring the bell at the gate, and thus announce to his father the arrival of his
  royal guest.</p>

  <p>Immediately on the summons, which he had for some time been impatiently
  awaiting, Colonel Maunsel appeared at the open doorway, at the head of his
  retainers, all of whom were clad in their richest liveries, as if for some
  high festivity. Never did the old Cavalier appear to greater advantage than
  on this occasion. He was attired in a rich court suit of black velvet, with
  rapier and plumed Spanish hat to correspond, and being roused to unwonted
  energy by the strong excitement of the moment, he moved with all his former
  grace and stateliness. Close behind him came Mr. Beard and Dulcia, the former
  in a plain suit of black, and the latter attired with great neatness and
  simplicity, but without any pretension to show or elegance. Such, however,
  was the effect of her charms of person and manner, and so little did she
  require the aid of dress and ornament, that Charles, when he beheld her, was
  quite electrified by her surpassing beauty, and thought he had never seen
  court dame so lovely as this country damsel, whose sole decoration was a few
  flowers placed amidst her fair clustering tresses. With the object of it
  before him, he ceased to wonder at Clavering&rsquo;s passion.</p>

  <p>Behind Colonel Maunsel, in the entrance-hall, appeared all the retainers
  that could be mustered for the occasion&mdash;all, as we have just intimated,
  in gala attire. None of these, it may be proper to state, had any positive
  knowledge of the exalted rank of the guest whom their master was about to
  welcome, though most of them suspected the truth. But though, as we are
  aware, the whole of the colonel&rsquo;s household were staunch Royalists, and
  might have been entrusted with the secret without fear of the consequences,
  the only one amongst them absolutely confided in was old Martin Geere.
  Greatly elated, and anxious to maintain his master&rsquo;s importance, the
  old serving-man now assumed a consequential manner and dignified deportment
  quite unlike his ordinary bearing. He was provided with a wand to marshal the
  household, and enable him to act as sort of usher in the approaching
  ceremony.</p>

  <p>At the precise moment when the old Cavalier appeared at the doorway,
  attended as we have described, Charles entered the gate of the mansion,
  Clavering respectfully retiring as the monarch advanced, and Lord Wilmot and
  Colonel Philips holding back, so that the king might be left alone.
  Notwithstanding the disguise adopted by the royal wanderer, and the change
  effected in his general appearance, Colonel Maunsel instantly recognised him,
  and, taking off his hat, advanced slowly and with great dignity, but with the
  most profound respect, to meet him and give him welcome. If Charles had come
  there in the plenitude of his power, in gorgeous apparel, and attended by a
  brilliant bevy of courtiers, instead of as a proscribed fugitive, and
  scantily attended, Colonel Maunsel could not have shown him greater
  reverence. It was with great difficulty that he prevented himself from
  bending the knee to the young king, and it was only, indeed, a gesture from
  Charles that restrained him. Contenting himself, therefore, with making a
  profound obeisance, he said, with a look that conveyed all he did not dare to
  utter, &ldquo;Welcome, sir! thrice welcome to Ovingdean Grange. My poor
  dwelling is honoured indeed by the presence of such a guest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you most heartily for your welcome, Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo;
  replied Charles. &ldquo;But it is far more than I merit. I have no other
  claim upon your attention save this&mdash;and it is much, I own,&rdquo; he
  added, with some significance&mdash;&ldquo;that you were warmly attached to
  my father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No man more so, sir,&rdquo; replied the old Cavalier,
  emphatically&mdash;&ldquo;no man more so. But pardon me if I say that your
  claims upon me are equal to those of your much- honoured, much-lamented
  sire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are pleased to say so, colonel,&rdquo; observed the king,
  &ldquo;and I thank you for the assurance. But a truce to claims real or
  imaginary! Allow me to see the interior of your mansion, which, if it
  corresponds with the outside, must be well worth inspection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a comfortable old house, quite sufficient for a plain
  country gentleman like myself, sir,&rdquo; replied the colonel; &ldquo;and if
  I am able to keep it up I shall be quite content. But the fines and
  confiscations of the rogues in power have wellnigh ruined me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, we are alike in misfortune, Colonel Maunsel,&rdquo;
  observed the king. &ldquo;You have lost much&mdash;I have lost all. But
  better days, I trust, are in store for both of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust so, sir,&rdquo; the old Cavalier replied. &ldquo;But now, I
  pray you, deign to enter my humble dwelling. And you, too, gentlemen,&rdquo;
  he added, saluting the others. &ldquo;Clavering, I am right glad to see thee,
  boy. Thy turn will come anon. Meantime, welcome thy father&rsquo;s guests,
  and show them in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, and respectfully retiring before the king, taking especial care
  not to turn his back upon his Majesty, the old Cavalier moved towards the
  house. His master&rsquo;s gestures were imitated by Martin Geere, but so
  unsuccessfully, that, in retreating somewhat too hastily, he came in contact
  with the steps, and tumbled backwards, amidst the titters of the rest of the
  serving-men. Charles would willingly have dispensed with so much ceremony,
  but aware of the punctilious character of his host, he did not like to put a
  stop to it. In this way he was ushered into the house, and compelled to take
  precedence of the others, who held back until he had entered.</p>

  <p>No sooner had Charles set foot in the entrance-hall, than the colonel once
  more gave him a hearty welcome to Ovingdean Grange, to which the king made a
  suitable reply. Mr. Beard then received the honour of a presentation, and his
  Majesty expressing a hope that he might be speedily restored to the living of
  which he had been deprived, he replied with humility,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not despair, sir. Vincit qui patitur.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And this, I suppose, is your daughter, Mr. Beard?&rdquo; inquired
  the king, determined to put his promise to Clavering into immediate
  execution, and looking with such undisguised admiration at Dulcia as summoned
  the roses to her cheek. &ldquo;On my faith, fair damsel,&rdquo; he continued,
  &ldquo;I have heard Clavering Maunsel speak of you&mdash;and in rapturous
  terms, I promise you&mdash;but, as I live, his description did not do you
  justice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must pray you, sir, to spare the maiden&rsquo;s blushes,&rdquo;
  interposed Colonel Maunsel. &ldquo;She is simple and home-bred, and
  unaccustomed to compliments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Egad! colonel, you mistake,&rdquo; cried the monarch; &ldquo;I
  never spoke with greater sincerity in my life. Your son did not say half so
  much of fair Mistress Dulcia as she deserves. She is lovely enough to grace
  the proudest hall in England&mdash;ay, a palace, if there be a palace left in
  the country. If I had been in Clavering&rsquo;s place I should have fallen in
  love to a dead certainty; and if&mdash;as perhaps might be the case&mdash;the
  fair Dulcia had not proved altogether insensible to my suit, I should have
  asked my father&rsquo;s consent,&rdquo; he added, to the colonel.</p>

  <p>This speech, as may be imagined, greatly embarrassed one person to whom it
  referred, but the king seemed wholly to disregard her confusion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what should you have answered, colonel, if such a question had
  been put to you?&rdquo; pursued Charles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Faith, sir, I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;I have not given the
  matter consideration,&rdquo; replied the old Cavalier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then do so,&rdquo; rejoined the king; &ldquo;and decide before I
  leave, for I have made up my mind that it shall be a match.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must have other and more important affairs to think of, I
  should fancy, sir,&rdquo; remarked Colonel Maunsel, &ldquo;than to trouble
  yourself, at a time like the present, about the loves of a foolish boy and
  girl. If there should be any fondness between them&mdash;of which I am
  ignorant&mdash;they must wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very prudent and proper,&rdquo; rejoined the king. &ldquo;Let them
  wait if you desire it, my good colonel, but not too long&mdash;not too long.
  There! we may consider the matter as settled,&rdquo; he added, with a glance
  at Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir,&rdquo; cried the colonel, &ldquo;you are very
  peremptory&mdash;and as prompt as peremptory. You have only been here a few
  minutes, and yet have made a marriage, whether the parties chiefly concerned
  like it or not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish! colonel,&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, &ldquo;I have taken
  care to satisfy myself on that score. Your consent alone is wanted, for good
  Mr. Beard&rsquo;s, I can see, is given already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, if I thought the happiness of the young folks was at
  stake,&rdquo; replied the colonel, &ldquo;I should not withhold my consent,
  you may depend, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew it!&mdash;I knew it!&rdquo; cried Charles, triumphantly.
  &ldquo;Bravo! bravissimo! Clavering, I congratulate you. You will soon have
  the prettiest wife in Sussex, and my only regret is that I cannot be present
  at the wedding. And now, colonel, before doing anything else, I would fain
  refresh myself with a little cold water, and get rid of the dust and heat of
  the journey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will instantly attend you to a chamber, sir, where all is in
  readiness,&rdquo; said the old Cavalier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On no account, colonel,&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;I will not
  permit it. You overwhelm me by your kindness. You have other guests to attend
  to besides myself. Clavering will show me the way&mdash;that is, if he can
  quit the side of his intended. Come, confess!&rdquo; he added, playfully, as
  he approached the young couple. &ldquo;Have I not done you both a good
  turn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In good truth you have, sir,&rdquo; replied Clavering. &ldquo;I
  will answer for Dulcia,&rdquo; he added, as the blushing damsel turned away
  to hide her confusion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upstairs at once, and away!&rdquo; cried Charles, &ldquo;or we
  shall have the old gentleman retract his promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Urged on by the king, who seemed determined to prevent any further display
  of etiquette, Clavering ran up the grand staircase, while Charles followed
  with equal celerity, much to the discomposure of Colonel Maunsel, who thought
  that his son ought to have observed more ceremony.</p>

  <p>On being ushered into the colonel&rsquo;s sleeping chamber, the king threw
  himself into an elbowchair and indulged in a hearty laugh. Clavering,
  meanwhile, anxious to escape from the raillery in which it was evident that
  the mirthful young monarch was disposed to indulge at his expense, proceeded
  towards the inner chamber to ascertain that all the necessaries for the
  king&rsquo;s toilette were ready, and finding that no change of linen had
  been placed there, he begged leave to retire in order to repair the omission.
  Charles nodded in token of assent, and Clavering, with a profound obeisance,
  quitted the room, leaving his Majesty still laughing heartily at the thoughts
  that tickled his fancy.</p>

  <p>By-and-by a gentle tap was heard at the door, and, in reply to
  Charles&rsquo;s summons to come in, Patty Whinchat entered, carrying with
  much care a fine linen shirt with laced ruffles, and a laced band of snowy
  whiteness placed upon it. Curtseying to the king, she tripped into the inner
  room and deposited the linen on the bed.</p>

  <p>Her errand performed, Patty returned, and dropping another curtsey to the
  king, observed,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Captain Clavering bade me say, sir, that if you have occasion for
  any change of apparel, you will find all you require in the
  wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Captain Clavering is very obliging,&rdquo; replied Charles,
  glancing admiringly at her. &ldquo;How art thou called, child, and what
  office dost fill in the house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am named Patty Whinchat, an please you, sir,&rdquo; she replied;
  &ldquo;and am handmaiden to Mistress Dulcia Beard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish, Patty!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, &ldquo;thy good looks
  rival those of thy mistress. Ye are both so pretty, that if I were asked
  which to take I should be fairly perplexed in the choice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you are not asked to take either of us, sir,&rdquo; Patty
  rejoined. &ldquo;My mistress has got a lover, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More than one, I&rsquo;ll be sworn!&rdquo; interrupted the king,
  &ldquo;or the serving-men have no taste. However, there&rsquo;ll be no great
  harm in robbing your favoured and fortunate swain, whoever he may be, of a
  kiss &ldquo;&mdash;suiting the action to the word. &ldquo;You have plenty to
  spare, both for him and me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; replied Patty; &ldquo;I
  shouldn&rsquo;t have half enow for Ninian Saxby, if I let him take as many as
  he wants. But don&rsquo;t detain me, sir, I pray of you. I mustn&rsquo;t stay
  here another minute. I&rsquo;m wanted downstairs. Somebody is below,
  I&rsquo;m told,&rdquo; she added, mysteriously, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m dying to
  have a peep at him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And who may this &lsquo;somebody&rsquo; be whom thou art so curious
  to behold, child?&rdquo; inquired Charles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The servants will have it the king is here,&rdquo; rejoined Patty;
  &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve said the same thing so often before that I
  don&rsquo;t exactly believe them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What sort of person is the king, child?&rdquo; said Charles.
  &ldquo;Should you know him if you beheld him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know him!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty. &ldquo;To be sure! the very
  instant I clapped eyes upon him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what is he like? Remarkably handsome, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Handsome! quite the contrary! He&rsquo;s remarkably
  plain&mdash;harsh features, and very dark. Mercy on us! if it
  should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, child?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it should be the king whom I&rsquo;ve been talking to all the
  time!&rdquo; she exclaimed, trembling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it were the king, I&rsquo;ll answer for it he would be the last
  person to be offended with so pretty a lass as thyself,&rdquo; said Charles,
  reassuring her with another kiss. &ldquo;But hie thee downstairs, and thou
  mayst possibly find out some one who will better answer to thy notions of
  what a monarch ought to be than myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Patty then curtseyed and moved towards the door, but she could not help
  casting another look at the king ere she quitted the room, exclaiming,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if it should be his Majesty, I shall never get over
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Much diverted by the incident, Charles went into the inner room, and
  before proceeding to disrobe himself, placed his rapier and the brace of
  pocket- pistols, which he usually carried with him, on a table set near the
  arras curtain hung between the two rooms. His ablutions performed, he next
  exchanged his travel- soiled undergarments for the fair linen provided by
  Patty, humming the while some snatches of a then popular French romance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he exclaimed, taking up the doublet he had just laid
  aside, this is a very comfortable old house, and I should have been quite as
  well lodged here as at Trent&mdash;and well cared for, moreover, by the
  pretty little Phillis who has just left me. For many reasons I am glad I am
  here, though Wilmot would fain have dissuaded me from doing soon the score of
  danger! Pshaw! no danger is to be apprehended&mdash;at all events, not
  to-day&mdash;and to-morrow his enemies will look in vain for Charles Stuart.
  Hang these Puritanical garments,&rdquo; he added, throwing down the jerkin in
  disgust, &ldquo;I abominate them. Let us see what this wardrobe contains. A
  doublet of Clavering&rsquo;s might suit me.&rdquo; With this he opened the
  door of the wardrobe, and taking out a handsome suit of black taffeta,
  exclaimed, &ldquo;Oddsfish! these are the very things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this, he proceeded to array himself in the, new-found apparel, which
  fitted him to admiration, and was adjusting his laced band before a mirror
  set in a frame of black oak, when the arras curtain was suddenly drawn aside,
  and two men, whose appearance and looks left him no doubt of their
  intentions, stepped from behind it.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-9"
     name="ch8-9">CHAPTER IX<br>
  How The King Was Shut Up In The Hiding-Place</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is scarcely necessary to say that the menacing intruders
  who surprised Charles at his toilette were Stelfax and Micklegift. The
  Ironside leader&rsquo;s first act was to possess himself of the pistols and
  rapier, which the king had incautiously laid upon the table, and deliver them
  to his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! betrayed!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, springing towards the table
  in search of his arms, and perceiving to his dismay that they were gone.</p>

  <p>Even in this extremity he did not lose his self-possession, but eyed his
  foes resolutely and even haughtily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What makes you here?&rdquo; he sternly demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am here to arrest thee, Charles Stuart, in the name of the
  Parliament of England, and by order of his Excellency the Lord General
  Cromwell. Surrender thyself my prisoner&mdash;rescue or no rescue&mdash;or I
  will shoot thee through the head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beware ere thou liftest thine hand against the Lord&rsquo;s
  anointed!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, with a look and gesture so full of
  majesty that it inspired awe in both his hearers, and the Ironside captain
  involuntarily lowered the pistol which he had levelled at the king.</p>

  <p>Charles instantly perceived the slight advantage he had gained, and sought
  to profit by it. If he could only gain time, he thought, assistance might
  arrive. He glanced around to see if there was a hand-bell within reach, a
  whistle, or any other means of giving the alarm. But nothing presented
  itself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the second time, I ask thee, Charles Stuart,&rdquo; said
  Stelfax, &ldquo;dost thou yield thyself a prisoner, or wilt thou compel me to
  lay violent hands upon thy person?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Off, villains!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, retreating a few paces.
  &ldquo;Touch me at your peril. I will resist to the death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be ruled by my counsel, O insensate young man!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Micklegift. &ldquo;Resistance is useless, and will bring instant destruction
  upon thee. Yield thee to what cannot be averted, and submit patiently to the
  decrees of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven hath never decreed that I shall perish by such base hands as
  those of thy comrade!&rdquo; cried the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better for thee thou shouldst die by my hands than by those of the
  headsman, like thy tyrannous father,&rdquo; retorted Stelfax. &ldquo;For the
  last time, I ask thee, dost thou yield thyself a prisoner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charles seemed to have taken a sudden resolution.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since it cannot be helped, I yield,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I
  couple my surrender with no promise. Keep guard over me as best ye may, I
  will escape if I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Stelfax made no reply, but signed to the monarch to come forth into the
  outer room. Charles obeyed, and marched towards his captors with great
  dignity and unshaken firmness, secretly wondering what they meant to do with
  him. He was not long kept in suspense.</p>

  <p>They were now in the centre of the chamber, and Stelfax directed his
  companion to open the door of the hiding-place. &ldquo;Thou know&rsquo;st the
  secret spring,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;touch it, I prithee. I will not
  quit the prisoner, even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Micklegift did as he was enjoined, pressed his hand upon the little knob
  that moved the pillar, and the aperture was disclosed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enter that hiding-place, Charles Stuart,&rdquo; said Stelfax,
  sternly, to the king. &ldquo;It was contrived for thy fugitive followers, and
  may therefore serve thy turn. &lsquo;Tis in vain to dispute my authority. I
  am thy master now, by right of the sword,&rdquo; he added, presenting his
  rapier&rsquo;s point at the king&rsquo;s breast, &ldquo;and will be obeyed.
  Enter, I command thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charles had no alternative but compliance. A struggle, under such
  disadvantageous circumstances, must have cost him his life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Plague take &lsquo;em!&rdquo; he muttered, as he went into the
  hiding- place. &ldquo;What the deuce can they all be about downstairs, to
  allow me to be trapped in this manner? Will no one come to the
  rescue?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But as rescue came not, he went in.</p>

  <p>Stelfax quickly followed, but, ere he passed quite through the aperture,
  he called out to Micklegift:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hie thee back as quickly as thou canst to Morefruit Stone&rsquo;s
  cottage. Dispatch him with all haste to Lewes for my men. Then return to this
  chamber, and if nought has happened in the interval, tap thrice against these
  boards. I shall know thy signal, and will come forth. The Lord hath delivered
  Abijam into my hands at last, and he shall never quit them with
  life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, he closed the door of the hiding place.</p>

  <p>Micklegift then passed through a small door in the inner chamber,
  partially concealed by arras, through which he and Stelfax had obtained
  admittance. This outlet communicated with a back staircase, which the
  Independent minister hastily descended. At the foot of the staircase was a
  postern, which let him out into the garden.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-10"
     name="ch8-10">CHAPTER X<br>
  The Puritan&rsquo;s Daughter</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOT many minutes after the king&rsquo;s immurement in the
  hiding-place, Clavering tapped at the chamber door, and receiving no answer,
  though he repeated the application yet more loudly, ventured to enter the
  apartment. Pausing for a moment in the outer chamber, and coughing slightly
  to announce his presence, he went on, and was both surprised and alarmed not
  to perceive the king. Remarking, however, that his Majesty had changed his
  attire, and that the small door communicating with the back staircase was
  left partly open, he concluded Charles must have discovered that means of
  exit, and had probably found his way to the garden. Notwithstanding this
  conviction, however, he could not shake off a strong feeling of uneasiness,
  and resolving to satisfy himself without delay, quickly descended the winding
  staircase and reached the postern at its foot, which he found unlocked. The
  latter circumstance convinced him that he was right in his conjecture, and he
  now felt certain of finding his Majesty in the garden. But though he visited
  every walk, alley, and labyrinth, he was unsuccessful, and all his alarm
  returned, and with additional force. One hope alone sustained him. The
  king&mdash;though this appeared highly improbable&mdash;might have strayed
  into the orchard, or the holt beyond it. To the orchard he flew at once, and
  had scarcely opened the gate leading to it when he encountered old Ticehurst,
  the gardener, and Nut Springett. In answer to his inquiries, Ticehurst stated
  that about five minutes ago he had seen a tall, dark man, answering to the
  description of the person Captain Clavering was inquiring about, issue from
  the postern, and pass out at the gate in the north wall near Morefruit
  Stone&rsquo;s cottage. Still more perplexed, but thinking this must be the
  king, though he was wholly unable to account for such imprudence on his
  Majesty&rsquo;s part, Clavering hurried off in the direction taken by the
  person whom the gardeners had seen, and passed through the gate referred to
  by them. Not fifty yards off, and shaded by a fine elm-tree, stood Morefruit
  Stone&rsquo;s cottage. Great was his surprise, on entering it, to find
  Increase Micklegift in the hands of John Habergeon and Ninian Saxby. The only
  person in the cottage, besides the Independent minister and his captors, was
  Morefruit Stone&rsquo;s daughter, Temperance, a comely damsel, to whom Ninian
  had once paid considerable attention. Instantly divining that treachery had
  been practised by Micklegift, Clavering drew his sword, and placing its point
  at the other&rsquo;s throat, demanded, in a terrible voice,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What hast thou done with him? Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harm me, and thou shalt never learn,&rdquo; replied the Independent
  minister, composedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us take him to the house at once, captain, and examine him
  there,&rdquo; said John Habergeon. &ldquo;He has important revelations to
  make. I warrant we will find means of making him speak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Try!&rdquo; rejoined Micklegift, with a look of cold contempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, we will try, and to some purpose, presently, I warrant
  thee,&rdquo; rejoined John. &ldquo;We will question thee with the thumbscrew
  and the scourge, after Captain Stelfax&rsquo;s fashion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How came you to find the villain here?&rdquo; inquired
  Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We received our information from pretty Temperance Stone,&rdquo;
  said Ninian, with a grateful look at the damsel in question; &ldquo;and I
  shall not soon forget the service she has done us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe to her! for she hath betrayed her father and her father&rsquo;s
  friend,&rdquo; said Micklegift, sternly. &ldquo;Her love for this vain youth
  shall never prosper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is more than you can answer for, rascal,&rdquo; replied
  Ninian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is her father?&rdquo; demanded Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hath escaped from the hands of these Philistines,&rdquo; said
  Micklegift, with a look of triumph, &ldquo;and will yet bring the enemy upon
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be not alarmed, sir,&rdquo; replied John Habergeon. &ldquo;He hath
  started for Lewes, but he cannot have gone far. Eustace Saxby is upon his
  track. Besides, there are others on the look-out, whose vigilance he will
  find it difficult to elude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not told all I know,&rdquo; said Temperance; &ldquo;but
  since I am provoked, I will withhold nothing.&rdquo; And she then proceeded
  to relate to Clavering that Micklegift and Stelfax were concealed in her
  father&rsquo;s cottage as he had passed on his way with the other gentlemen
  to the house. That one of the party had been recognized by the two men, who
  declared it was the Young Man. That Stelfax then declared that at all hazards
  he would obtain admission to the house and accomplish his arrest, and
  Micklegift agreed to accompany him, telling him he knew a way by which they
  could obtain secret admission to the colonel&rsquo;s sleeping chamber.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The colonel&rsquo;s sleeping chamber, damsel&mdash;art sure he
  mentioned that room?&rdquo; demanded John Habergeon. &ldquo;If so, they must
  have gained admission by the postern opening from the back stairs into the
  garden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They did so,&rdquo; replied Clavering. &ldquo;But how came the door
  open?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A scornful smile lighted up Micklegift&rsquo;s sallow features.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hath a master-key, no doubt,&rdquo; replied Temperance,
  &ldquo;for he unlocked the garden-gate, and they went in together. Feeling
  sure some great mischief was afoot, I made an excuse to quit the cottage, and
  hastened in search of Ninian, whom I found with his father and John
  Habergeon, and told him what had happened, and they all three came back with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We saw Micklegift from a distance enter the cottage,&rdquo; said
  Ninian, &ldquo;and pounced upon him before he was aware. And here we have him
  safe enough, as you see, to answer for his offences.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But where is Stelfax?&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering. &ldquo;Where
  is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Young Man Charles Stuart thou wouldst say,&rdquo; supplied
  Micklegift. &ldquo;Neither of them wilt thou find till it be too
  late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Villain, I will force thee to disclose where the king is!&rdquo;
  cried Clavering, with a look of distraction&mdash;&ldquo;I will tear the
  secret from thy breast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold, your honour!&rdquo; exclaimed John. &ldquo;I think I have
  discovered it. Where was the king last seen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I left him alone to attire himself in my father&rsquo;s sleeping
  chamber,&rdquo; replied Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, depend upon it he is shut up in the hiding-place, and Stelfax
  is there with him,&rdquo; cried John.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A shrewd guess!&rdquo; exclaimed Clavering. &ldquo;I can see from
  this rascal&rsquo;s looks that thou art in the right. Bring him along! We
  must not lose a moment in setting our royal master free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold yet a moment, and listen to me,&rdquo; said Micklegift.
  &ldquo;I will not deny that you have hit upon the truth, for it is vain to
  attempt further concealment. But ye cannot liberate Charles Stuart without my
  aid. Stelfax will slay his prisoner rather than yield him to you. Such I know
  to be his purpose, and ye are acquainted with his determined character.
  Promise to do me no injury, and I will avert this direful catastrophe, which
  will otherwise inevitably ensue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clavering reflected for a moment, and then replied, &ldquo;I give thee the
  promise thou requirest. Bring him along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, there will be no need to use force,&rdquo; said Micklegift.
  &ldquo;I will go peaceably enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must come with us too, fair mistress,&rdquo; said Ninian to
  Temperance. &ldquo;We cannot leave you behind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no desire to be left,&rdquo; replied the blushing maiden,
  displaying great readiness to accompany him.</p>

  <p>The whole party then quitted the cottage. Micklegift marched between John
  and Ninian, who, notwithstanding their captive&rsquo;s promise to go quietly,
  thought it right to keep firm hold of him. In this manner they crossed the
  garden and proceeded to the little postern.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8-11"
     name="ch8-11">CHAPTER XI<br>
  In Which The Tables Are Turned Upon Stelfax</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A PRISONER in a narrow cell, with an inexorable gaoler close
  beside him, and ready to slay him if he attempted escape, Charles did not
  lose his confidence. Deliverance he felt sure would come. His absence must be
  ere long discovered by the inmates of the house, and then search would be
  made for him, and it was scarcely probable that this hiding-place, of which
  he himself had heard Clavering speak, would remain unvisited. Still, great
  risk might be incurred at the moment when his liberation should be attempted,
  and he tried to consider what ought to be done at that hazardous conjuncture.
  Leaning against the wall of the cell, he assumed a perfectly indifferent air,
  and began to hum snatches of French ditties, as he had previously done while
  making his toilette. This show of gaiety and unconcern was so annoying to
  Stelfax, that he at last sternly rebuked him for his unseemly levity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you prefer that I should join you in a hymn, captain?&rdquo;
  said Charles. &ldquo;Lead on, and I will accompany you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trouble me not, thou vain young man, but keep silence,&rdquo;
  rejoined Stelfax, sternly.</p>

  <p>The careless monarch was not, however, to be checked, but went on humming
  his songs in spite of his moody gaoler. In this manner nearly half an hour
  passed away. Charles then began to find the confinement irksome, and asked,
  with some impatience, how long he was to be kept there? Stelfax made no
  reply, but the next moment the attention of both was caught by a slight
  sound&mdash;a tap against the piece of wood screening the entrance to the
  recess. Charles started, but controlled himself by a great effort. Was relief
  come? Or was it the aid expected by Stelfax?</p>

  <p>The Ironside captain likewise listened attentively, and not without
  anxiety. The tap was repeated; and again, after a pause, for the third time.
  There could be no doubt now. It was Micklegift.</p>

  <p>Sternly enjoining the king to follow him, Stelfax moved forward.</p>

  <p>At this moment the secret spring was touched, the door of the recess flew
  open, and the voice of the Independent minister was heard to call out,
  &ldquo;It is I, Increase Micklegift. Come forth without fear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Addressing another stern injunction to the king to follow him, Stelfax
  drew a pistol from his belt, and grasping his bared sword in his left hand,
  to be ready for instant service if required, stepped out into the room.</p>

  <p>Micklegift was standing in the middle of the chamber, almost opposite the
  fireplace, and, on seeing Stelfax, signed to him to follow him to the inner
  room, moving quickly in that direction himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; vociferated Stelfax, angrily. &ldquo;Whither goest
  thou? I may need thy aid with the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glancing backwards as he spoke, to ascertain whether Charles was
  following, he caught sight of two men lurking within the angle of the
  chimney-piece, ready to spring upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! treacherous dog, thou hast played me false!&rdquo; he
  vociferated. &ldquo;But thou shalt not escape punishment!&rdquo; With which
  words he fired his pistol at the Independent minister, and with fatal effect.
  Micklegift uttered a cry, staggered, and fell backwards. &ldquo;Neither shalt
  thou escape!&rdquo; he continued, turning to attack the king, who at this
  moment appeared at the entrance of the recess; but ere he could execute his
  purpose, or indeed turn completely round, John Habergeon had thrown himself
  upon him, and, aided by Ninian, succeeded in disarming him.</p>

  <p>Charles himself was close at hand, but did not interfere in the struggle,
  seeing his assistance was wholly unneeded. Clavering had also sprung, sword
  in hand, from behind a piece of furniture; but ere he could reach the scene
  of action the seizure of the redoubted Ironside leader was accomplished, and
  all that was left for the young man to do was to congratulate his Majesty on
  his deliverance.</p>

  <p>But there were others, as it presently appeared, who were equally anxious
  to express their feelings of satisfaction. The arras curtain was drawn aside,
  and from the inner room issued a number of persons, who had been anxiously
  awaiting the result of Micklegift&rsquo;s device, which, though successful as
  far as the king&rsquo;s safety was concerned, had proved disastrous to
  himself. No one, however, troubled himself about the luckless Independent
  minister for the moment. He was left to lie where he had fallen. All the
  attention was directed towards the king. The party now flocking towards him,
  which consisted of Colonel Maunsel, Lord Wilmot, Colonel Philips, with Mr.
  Beard and his daughter, together with old Martin Geere, were enthusiastic in
  their demonstrations of joy. Concealment was no longer possible, neither was
  it attempted. Charles was now recognized by all as their sovereign. Bending
  the knee before the monarch, Colonel Maunsel took the hand which his Majesty
  graciously extended towards him, and gave utterance to his unbounded feelings
  of delight, while the rest, completely carried away by enthusiasm, made the
  roof echo with their loyal shouts of &ldquo;God save King Charles!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Much touched by this exhibition of their loyalty, Charles, as soon as he
  could obtain silence, thanked them for their zeal, in accents betraying the
  depth of his emotion, and attesting his sincerity.</p>

  <p>But another matter now claimed the king&rsquo;s attention. One of his
  enemies was gone to his account, but the more dangerous of the two was left,
  to expiate his offences with his life. Charles prepared to pass judgment upon
  him.</p>

  <p>Disarmed, with his elbows tightly pinioned to his side by a sword-belt,
  having a guard on either hand ready to stab him or shoot him if he attempted
  resistance&mdash;which, indeed, in his present state, was wellnigh
  impossible&mdash;the Ironside captain, who refused to move at John
  Habergeon&rsquo;s bidding, was forcibly dragged before the king.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Charles having seated himself in a richly carved oak chair,
  high- backed, and provided with a cushion of Utrecht velvet, placed his foot
  on a stool covered with the same material, which was set before him with the
  most profound respect by old Martin Geere. At the same time the company
  stationed themselves on either side of the chair occupied by his Majesty,
  thus giving the group some slight resemblance to a gathering round the
  throne. On the right of the king, and close to the royal chair, stood Colonel
  Maunsel leaning on his drawn sword. On the same side were Lord Wilmot and
  Colonel Philips. On the left stood Clavering, with his rapier bared, and held
  with its point to the ground. Near to Clavering were Dulcia and Mr. Beard. At
  some little distance, near the inner room, was a group, consisting of Giles
  Moppett, Elias Crundy, and others of the household, together with Patty
  Whinchat and Temperance Stone. When Stelfax was brought before the king, John
  Habergeon would fain have compelled him to make an obeisance, but the
  stubborn Republican refused, and, drawing himself up, said, &ldquo;I will not
  bow the head to the son of the tyrant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him be,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;It is too late to teach him
  manners. What hast thou to say, fellow,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the
  prisoner, &ldquo;why I should not order thee to instant execution?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Stelfax, resolutely. &ldquo;I am prepared
  to die. A soldier of the Lord would scorn to ask life from the son of
  Rehoboam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thy life is justly forfeited,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Thou
  hast compassed my destruction, and hast lifted thy sacrilegious hand against
  the Lord&rsquo;s anointed; but it was not Heaven&rsquo;s will that I should
  thus perish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may be thou art reserved to be a scourge to the land like thy
  father,&rdquo; said Stelfax; &ldquo;but if there are any left of my mind, thy
  reign will be short, and thy end bloody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I pray your Majesty give no further hearing to the rebellious
  villain,&rdquo; said John Habergeon. &ldquo;Let us take him forth, and deal
  with him as his crimes deserve. We will first strike off the hand which he
  hath impiously raised against your sacred person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ere Charles could give his consent to the solicitation, Dulcia stepped
  forward, and threw herself at his feet. In this supplicating posture she
  lifted up her hands, and said, in accents of the most earnest entreaty,
  &ldquo;Beseech your Majesty, cut not off the man&rsquo;s life thus suddenly.
  Give him time for repentance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a soldier, lady,&rdquo; replied the king, gravely,
  &ldquo;and, as such, should be prepared to die. We see no reason why delay
  should be granted him. He would have given none to ourself. Yet he shall have
  time for prayer. See that it be so, good fellow,&rdquo; he added to John
  Habergeon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go with him, and strive to bring him to repentance, said Mr.
  Beard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not desire thy presence,&rdquo; said Stelfax sternly. &ldquo;I
  can make up my account with Heaven without thy aid. Yon hypocritical traitor,
  whom I have dispatched before me,&rdquo; he added, looking towards the body
  of Micklegift, &ldquo;hath disgusted me with all who profess the sacred
  calling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! hast thou no repentance for the bloody deed thou hast
  done?&rdquo; demanded the clergyman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wherefore should I repent?&rdquo; rejoined Stelfax. &ldquo;The man
  was justly slain. He had betrayed me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There thou art wrong,&rdquo; remarked John Rabergeon.
  &ldquo;Micklegift was a captive in our hands, and we compelled him to lure
  thee forth, in order to prevent harm being done by thee to his
  Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And well was it for Charles Stuart that ye employed the
  device,&rdquo; remarked Stelfax. &ldquo;If that bullet had not been wasted on
  the fool Micklegift, it would have been lodged in your king&rsquo;s brain.
  Well was it also for Charles Stuart that he came to this house ere I was
  prepared for him. Had he tarried till to- morrow, his escape had been
  impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My warning, you see, was not in vain,&rdquo; observed the king to
  Clavering.</p>

  <p>Again Dulcia interceded for Stelfax, imploring his Majesty not to doom him
  to instant death.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have an interest more than ordinary in this man, young
  lady,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;Whence arises it? Speak frankly, if you
  desire to serve him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I owe him some gratitude, my liege,&rdquo; replied Dulcia,
  &ldquo;inasmuch as he respected me when I was in his power. While detained as
  a prisoner with my father at Lewes, Captain Stelfax sought to win my love,
  but by honourable means alone, and finding at length that his suit was
  hopeless, he generously&mdash;nay, I must use the word, sire&mdash;he
  generously set my father and myself at liberty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is true, my gracious liege,&rdquo; said Mr. Beard. &ldquo;As
  my daughter hath stated, we were both in his hands for nigh three weeks, and
  were treated by him with much respect&mdash;nay, with kindness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am bound also to add my testimony to that already given, that the
  man showed me much personal consideration, and detained me not when I
  surrendered myself to him at Lewes,&rdquo; said Colonel Maunsel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish!&rdquo; exclaimed the good-natured monarch, &ldquo;the
  knave seems to have some better qualities than might be expected. And so you
  intercede for him, eh, fair mistress?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Earnestly&mdash;most earnestly,&rdquo; cried Dulcia.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you too, worthy sir?&rdquo; continued the king, turning to Mr.
  Beard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As earnestly as my child, sire,&rdquo; the good clergyman
  replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what says Colonel Maunsel?&rdquo; cried Charles, looking at the
  old Cavalier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my liege, I know not what to say,&rdquo; rejoined the colonel,
  with a look of perplexity. &ldquo;I do not like to beg the man&rsquo;s life,
  after what hath happened&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tut! tut!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;Whatever faults may be
  imputed to him, it shall never be said that Charles Stuart was wanting in
  magnanimity. I forgive the fellow his attempt upon my life. Nay, it is my
  pleasure that he be set free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Set free!&rdquo; exclaimed Stelfax, in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, but not till it can be done with safety,&rdquo; said the king.
  &ldquo;Of that Colonel Maunsel will judge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Colonel Maunsel will exercise his own discretion in the
  matter,&rdquo; said Stelfax; &ldquo;but henceforth your Majesty&mdash;for I
  must needs style you so&mdash;will have no enemy in me. My lips shall be
  sealed to all I have seen and heard this day. I am not a man to make
  professions, but thus much I will promise Colonel Maunsel in return for his
  generosity, that he shall not, if I can help it, be called to account for
  sheltering his proscribed sovereign. To that I plight my word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you will keep your word, I am certain, Captain Stelfax,&rdquo;
  rejoined the king. &ldquo;Unbind him,&rdquo; he added to John Habergeon.</p>

  <p>But as the old trooper hesitated to obey the king&rsquo;s command, and was
  on the point of remonstrating with his Majesty on the apparent imprudence of
  the step, Dulcia, who had already risen, sprang towards the prisoner, and
  with her own hands undid his bonds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are now quits, Captain Stelfax,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I owe my life to you, maiden,&rdquo; replied the other, in a voice
  of deep emotion. &ldquo;Would it could be devoted to your service!&mdash;but
  I know this cannot be. May you be happy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dulcia did not trust herself to reply, but went hastily back to Clavering,
  who had looked on in speechless astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take Captain Stelfax below,&rdquo; said Colonel Maunsel to John
  Habergeon, &ldquo;and see that he wants nothing. Circumstances, as you will
  readily apprehend, sir,&rdquo; he added to the Ironside leader, &ldquo;will
  not permit me to requite your former civility to myself by allowing you to
  depart as a prisoner on parole, but your comforts shall be attended
  to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot expect better treatment,&rdquo; replied Stelfax.
  &ldquo;The best wish I can offer to your Majesty is that you may soon see the
  other side of the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With an obeisance to the king he then retired, John Habergeon and Ninian
  marching on either side of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is some good about that rough Republican,&rdquo; observed the
  king, when he was gone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty seems to think so,&rdquo; observed Lord Wilmot.
  &ldquo;After your magnanimous treatment of him, I do not wonder he war
  converted, and only marvel he did not, swear fidelity on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish! my lord, you overrate my conduct. I had taken the sting
  from the hornet, why crush the creature? Besides, I owed the fellow
  something, for he might have dispatched me when I was alone with him in yon
  hiding-place. But the matter is well over, and without harm to any one except
  that miserable Independent minister, who seems to have deserved his
  fate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear he did, sire,&rdquo; replied Colonel Maunsel. &ldquo;And
  since all has ended so fortunately, I will pray your Majesty to adjourn to
  the banqueting-room, where a trifling collation awaits you. As things have
  turned out, it is lucky that the chief part of the dishes composing the
  repast are cold, otherwise the cook&rsquo;s labour might have been thrown
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the banqueting-chamber, then, at once,&rdquo; exclaimed the
  king, gaily. &ldquo;&lsquo;Fore George! colonel, I promise to do justice to
  your feast, whether the meats be hot or cold. My confinement in yon
  lurking-hole has given me a wondrous appetite. Your hand, fair
  mistress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blushing with pleasure at the honour conferred upon her, Dulcia gave her
  hand to his Majesty, who led her down the grand staircase, and through the
  entrance- hall into the dining-room, where the tables were groaning beneath
  the weight of a sumptuous repast.</p>

  <p>All the guests had very speedily assembled, and a place was assigned to
  each by Colonel Maunsel&mdash;Charles, however, insisting upon Dulcia sitting
  near him, though he good-naturedly intimated to Clavering that he might
  occupy the chair on the damsel&rsquo;s other side. The repast was abundant
  and excellent, and the best wines in the colonel&rsquo;s cellar, as might
  naturally be expected, were produced on the occasion, old Martin Geere taking
  care that the glasses were kept constantly filled. The party were still
  seated at table, though the appetites of most of the guests were satisfied,
  when Colonel Gunter, and his kinsman, Captain Gunter, were announced, and the
  two gentlemen entered the room. They had just arrived from Shoreham, and
  brought the welcome intelligence that Captain Tattersall had got in his
  cargo, and was quite ready to sail the next morning before daybreak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The rascal, however, still sticks to his terms,&rdquo; said Colonel
  Gunter, &ldquo;and insists upon seeing his passengers before he will agree to
  take them. But it is only a whim, I am certain. There will be no real
  difficulty with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why did you not bring him here?&rdquo; cried the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the best of all reasons, my liege,&rdquo; replied Gunter;
  &ldquo;because he would not come. But he has appointed to meet you this
  evening at the George at Brightelmstone; and though I am very reluctant to
  disturb your enjoyment, and withdraw you from further participation of
  Colonel Maunsel&rsquo;s hospitality, yet I think it will be best and wisest
  to repair to Brightelmstone without delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You summon me from a most delightful entertainment,&rdquo; said the
  king. &ldquo;However, sit down for a moment, man, and do you also take a
  chair, Captain Gunter. Let all glasses be charged&mdash;my own, you see, is
  full to the brim. I will not depart without drinking the health of our host,
  and I hope it may not be long ere I shall visit him again&mdash;though in
  other sort than the present&mdash;at Ovingdean Grange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old Cavalier was quite overwhelmed by the gracious words of his royal
  master, and vainly endeavoured to express his deep sense of gratitude.
  Charles, however, took him kindly by the hand, and said,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not another word, colonel&mdash;not another word. I know what you
  would say. Do not forget your promise to me to make these two young people
  happy. Take my word for it, your son could not have made a better choice. I
  must now bid you adieu! Brief as my visit has been, it has comprehended
  incident enough to serve me for a much longer interval, and I might have
  remained a week in some other places and not have had half so much
  excitement. My adventures at Ovingdean Grange are a worthy finish to my six
  weeks&rsquo; wanderings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The king then rose, and all the company rose likewise. Finding it was his
  Majesty&rsquo;s wish to depart immediately, notwithstanding his
  disappointment at losing his royal guest, and his desire to detain him,
  Colonel Maunsel did not offer any opposition, but ordered the horses to be
  brought round without delay. While his injunctions were being fulfilled, the
  king repaired to the colonel&rsquo;s chamber, and resumed the travelling
  habiliments which he had temporarily laid aside. Equipped as he had been on
  his arrival, he then descended to the entrance-hall, where all were assembled
  to witness his departure, the household crowding round him, and reiterating
  their expressions of loyalty and devotion as he came down the staircase.
  Foremost amongst them was Patty Whinchat, who was fortunate enough to obtain
  a valedictory word and smile from his Majesty. Temperance Stone was also
  amongst the throng, and from that moment abjured her Republican notions, and
  became a staunch Royalist. Bowing repeatedly to the assemblage, and
  addressing a few parting civilities to Dulcia and Mr. Beard, Charles went
  forth with his host, who would insist upon holding the stirrup for him as he
  mounted, and who invoked Heaven&rsquo;s blessings on his Majesty&rsquo;s
  head, as the king bade him a kindly farewell.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by an escort, consisting of Clavering Maunsel and Lord Wilmot,
  Colonel Philips and the two Gunters, and followed by John Habergeon and
  Ninian Saxby, the king rode slowly up the valley, and then mounted the
  eminence on the left.</p>

  <p>On gaining the brow of the hill, he paused for a moment to take a last
  look of the old house amidst its trees, and then rode round the sweeping
  heights of White Hawk Hill in the direction of Brightelmstone.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk9"
     name="bk9">BOOK IX. BRIGHTELMSTONE IN 1651</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="ch9-1"
     name="ch9-1">CHAPTER I<br>
  A Glance At Brightelmstone In The Nineteenth Century</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LITTLE did Charles the Second foresee, when halting on the
  evening in question with his escort on the smooth and pleasant slopes of the
  hill now laid out as the Queen&rsquo;s Park, that on the site of the obscure
  fishing-village towards which he gazed, would arise, some two centuries
  later, one of the fairest and most magnificent cities ever built on the
  margin of the sea, since the time when Pompeii the Beautiful was destroyed by
  the fiery ashes of Vesuvius. Little did he think that the bare and solitary
  cliffs above which he stood would be covered with lines of stately terraces,
  comprising mansions many of which would rival in size and splendour the most
  princely habitations of the London of his own day. Little did he think that
  in that wide hollow, now known as the Steyne, through the midst of which an
  open brook found its way to the sea, where stunted trees distorted by the
  gales, and mean scattered habitations surrounded by patches of ill-kept
  gardens, and tenanted by fishermen and other seafaring folk, could alone be
  distinguished&mdash;little did he think that in this dreary hollow one of the
  most refined of his successors, and one whose Sybaritic tastes were in many
  respects akin to his own, would construct a palace of Oriental splendour.
  Little did he foresee that, in the lapse of time, this remote and almost
  unknown fishing village on the Sussex coast should become, by agencies of
  which he could not dream, and which, if described, he might not have
  credited, so connected with the great metropolis itself, as to form almost
  its marine suburb. Little did he foresee these wondrous and inconceivable
  changes. And if a vision of the Brighton of the Nineteenth Century could have
  been revealed to him, he might have thought he had been suddenly transported
  to some other and more favoured portion of the globe. What two centuries more
  may do for this superb marine city we are not bold enough to speculate. But
  if the changes should be as great as those which have occurred since Charles
  the Second gazed upon the little parent village on the evening of the 14th of
  October, 1651, Brighton will have become a marvellous city indeed.</p>

  <p>But since there was no magician in the young king&rsquo;s escort to raise
  up for him a vision of the future splendid city, nor any astrologer to
  foretell its grandeur, Charles saw only that which was exhibited to the
  ordinary eye of humanity. And the picture, it must be owned, was one that did
  not excite any extraordinary interest in his breast; neither might it merit
  any special description, except that there may be some persons not indisposed
  to learn what the Queen of English watering-places was like two centuries
  ago.</p>

  <p>Immediately below the gentle declivity where Charles was stationed, and
  almost on the spot now occupied by Royal Crescent, stood three windmills, not
  very far apart from each other. These windmills, with a solitary farm-house
  and barn, together with a few scattered cottages, were the only buildings
  discernible on the eastern cliff. The village of Brightelmstone actually
  stood on the western side of the Steyne, where the older part of the town is
  still to be found. Here, on a gentle declivity of the hill, on the summit of
  which stood the ancient church of Saint Nicholas, then far removed from every
  other habitation, and serving as a landmark to the mariner, was collected
  together a considerable number of houses, few of them of any size or
  pretension, and for the most part constructed of glazed bricks mingled with
  flints, in order to resist the weather, and having shingle roofs.</p>

  <p>Like most old Sussex towns&mdash;as, for example, Chichester and
  Lewes&mdash;Brightelmstone was so closely and compactly built that it might
  be described as a great block of houses, intersected by alleys or lanes so
  extremely narrow as scarcely to allow two persons meeting in them to pass
  each other, and known in the dialect of the place as &ldquo;twittens.&rdquo;
  But perhaps the most curious feature of the old town, all traces of which
  have long since been swept away by the encroachments of the sea, was then to
  be found below the cliff. Here was built a long street of little tenements,
  stretching from the Steyne for more than a quarter of a mile along the shore
  in the direction of Hove. These tenements were exclusively inhabited by
  fishermen and boatmen, a bold and hardy, though somewhat troublesome, race,
  who claimed to themselves certain privileges and immunities, and were
  uncommonly tenacious, and, indeed, pugnacious, in the maintenance of their
  supposed rights. The Brightelmstone fishermen formed a distinct class from
  the rest of the townsfolk, and were constantly at loggerheads with the
  latter. On the edge of the cliff, and towering above these humble dwellings,
  which it threatened to crush by its fall (and such an accident did eventually
  occur), stood, at the date of our story, an ancient castle, or block-house of
  stone, constructed by Henry VIII about the year 1539, for the defence of the
  coast. The town of Brightelmstone, as we have stated, was chiefly
  concentrated on the side of the hill, and did not extend beyond West Street,
  whither we shall presently repair. From this point to the neighbouring
  village of Hove there only intervened a few cottages and a single farm-house,
  and these at wide intervals.</p>

  <p>Noting much that we have described&mdash;namely, the old church, the
  cluster of houses on the hill-side, and the block-house&mdash;Charles
  suffered his gaze to stray towards Shoreham, where he could just descry the
  masts of the vessels within the harbour, and wondered whether any that he saw
  belonged to the Swiftsure.</p>

  <p>Satisfied with his survey, Charles put his horse in motion, and the whole
  party rode on, taking their way down the declivity, which is now occupied by
  a dense mass of habitations, but which was then merely the green slope of a
  down&mdash;its smoothness being here and there broken by a patch of gorse or
  a venerable hawthorn. Sheep were fed, and the shepherd trod on the thymy turf
  then covering the descent where now runs the crowded thoroughfare of Saint
  James&rsquo;-street. At the foot of the hill grew a small straggling holt,
  and the stunted trees composing it looked like well-worn brooms, so distorted
  were they by the strong south-westerly gales blowing along the valley.</p>

  <p>On the verge of this thicket a halt was made, and it was then arranged
  that the king should proceed, under the guidance of Colonel Gunter only, to
  the George Inn, in West street. Lord Wilmot was to join them there after a
  while; but it was not deemed prudent that the others should appear at the
  inn&mdash;at all events, not until a much later hour. Meanwhile, they
  undertook to act as scouts about the town, under the direction of Clavering
  Maunsell.</p>

  <p>These arrangements made, the king and Colonel Gunter dismounted, and
  leaving their steeds with the others, crossed a bridge over the little brook
  running through the valley, and immediately afterwards entered the town.
  Their object being to elude observation, they walked quickly, Colonel Gunter,
  as acquainted with the place, keeping slightly ahead of the monarch. After
  proceeding to a short distance up North street, they plunged into a narrow
  alley on the left, and having tracked a series of &ldquo;twittens,&rdquo;
  without encountering any material check in their progress, except such as was
  offered by a fat fishwoman, who compelled them both to seek temporary refuge
  in an open doorway while she passed by, they issued forth in West
  street&mdash;if street a few scattered houses ought to be called&mdash;at the
  lower end of which, within a hundred yards of the sea, stood the hostel of
  which they were in search.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9-2"
     name="ch9-2">CHAPTER II<br>
  The &ldquo;George&rdquo; At Brightelmstone</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE George Inn, which still exists, though, since the event
  we are about to relate it has very properly altered its designation, and is
  now known as the King&rsquo;s Head, was a comfortable house, noted for good
  liquor and for the civility of the host, whose name was of good augury to the
  guest, being no other than Bonfellow Smith.</p>

  <p>The hostel, which stood on the west side of the straggling street, was
  detached from the adjacent habitations, and was further separated from the
  dwelling on its northerly side by a large yard. It was a commodious, well
  built structure, with bay-windows, projecting porch with carved posts and
  lintel, gable roof covered with shingle, and large chimneys of the true
  Sussex build, and wore altogether a not uninviting aspect. Such, at least,
  was the impression produced upon Charles as he followed his conductor into
  the house.</p>

  <p>Master Bonfellow Smith, host of the George, had nothing of the Puritan in
  his appearance or deportment. He was all smiles and civility&mdash;indeed,
  his manner might almost be termed obsequious&mdash;while it was abundantly
  manifest from his rotund person, rosy gills, and double chin, that he was by
  no means accustomed to mortify the flesh. Originally, he had filled the
  office of groom of the chamber in the royal establishment at Whitehall, and
  was then a great man&mdash;a very great man. But times had changed. Rebellion
  and revolution were in the ascendant; the royal household was broken up and
  dispersed; and our groom of the chamber retired in disgust to his native
  village of Brightelmstone, and eventually became landlord of the comfortable
  hostel where we find him. Master Bonfellow Smith was lucky enough to possess
  a wife who proved of infinite use to him in his business. Like her husband,
  she had filled a subordinate situation in the royal household at Whitehall,
  having been tire-maiden to one of the queen&rsquo;s gentlewomen, and, like
  him, she could not forget her former importance; but being a person of great
  prudence, she accommodated herself to existing circumstances, and did not
  allow her recollections of bygone grandeur to interfere with the discharge of
  her duties as a landlady. Mrs. Smith was some years younger than her spouse;
  and had been accounted very pretty by pages and other gallants at Whitehall.
  She was still a comely woman, though on rather a large scale. It was by this
  worthy couple that Charles was welcomed on entering the inn.</p>

  <p>Bowing obsequiously to his guests, on hearing that they meant to take
  supper, and expected two or three friends to join them at it, the host
  directed his wife to bring lights&mdash;it was now growing rapidly
  dusk&mdash;and ushered the gentlemen into a roomy chamber on the right, which
  looked very snug and comfortable, inasmuch as a cheerful fire was burning on
  the hearth. The apartment was wainscoted with black oak, and well provided
  with elbow chairs of the same material. A solid oak table stood in the centre
  of the floor, and a bow-window at the side looked into the inn yard.</p>

  <p>Buxom Mrs. Smith followed close upon the king&rsquo;s heels with the
  lights, and was about to set them down upon the table, when Charles turned
  and looked her full in the face. Her features seemed familiar to him, though
  he could not call to mind under what circumstances he had previously beheld
  them. But if the king&rsquo;s memory was at fault, Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s was
  not. She instantly recognized the young monarch in his disguise, uttered a
  faint scream, and began to gasp and shake so violently that the candles
  threatened to fall from her hold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oons! Joan&mdash;what the plague ails the woman?&rdquo;
  exclaimed Bonfellow Smith, staring at her in surprise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
  the matter, I say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;o&mdash;on&rsquo;t know&mdash;I
  ca&mdash;a&mdash;n&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; she stammered, as Charles signed to
  her to keep silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and can&rsquo;t speak!&rdquo; echoed Smith.
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Sbud! this is something new. You can use your tongue pretty
  freely in an ordinary way. Set down the candles and leave the
  room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allow me to help you, my good mistress,&rdquo; said the king,
  taking the candles from her, and placing them on the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg your honour&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; exclaimed Smith, in an
  apologetic tone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what has come to my wife. I never
  saw her in such a way before. Don&rsquo;t stand staring there, Joan, I tell
  &lsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind your wife, my good man,&rdquo; said Charles.
  &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right presently. Draw the window-curtain, for we
  don&rsquo;t care to be overlooked&mdash;and then we&rsquo;ll talk about
  supper. Compose yourself, if possible, my good Joan,&rdquo; he added, in a
  whisper, &ldquo;or you will rouse your husband&rsquo;s suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! your Majesty needn&rsquo;t fear him,&rdquo; she rejoined, in
  the same tone. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a more loyal subject than Smith. He
  would lay down his life for you. Here, hubby! hubby!&rdquo; she cried aloud,
  &ldquo;come this way! Look at this gentleman, and you&rsquo;ll no longer
  wonder at my excitement. Don&rsquo;t you know him?&rdquo; she added, seizing
  his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know him! Gadzooks! I should think I did!&rdquo; exclaimed Smith,
  now almost as much excited as his wife. &ldquo;I should know that face amid a
  thousand. Oh dear! oh dear! that the like of this should ever have come to
  pass!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down on your knees, hubby&mdash;down on your knees!&rdquo; cried
  Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;Render your homage to his Majesty&mdash;swear fidelity to
  him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I swear to be faithful, my gracious liege,&rdquo; cried Bonfellow
  Smith, as he and his wife prostrated themselves before Charles.
  &ldquo;Command me as you please!&mdash;take all I possess&mdash;my house, my
  goods, my chattels, my wife&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I won&rsquo;t rob you of your wife, my good fellow,&rdquo;
  replied Charles, laughing. &ldquo;I accept your assurances of fidelity,
  satisfied that I may rely upon them, and hoping most sincerely that they may
  not be put to the test during my brief stay under your roof. Accident, or
  rather, I ought to say, a kind Providence, has again thrown me amongst
  friends, who will, I am firmly persuaded, watch over my security. To show the
  entire confidence I repose in you both, I will unhesitatingly inform you
  that, early to-morrow morning, I am about to embark at Shoreham for France,
  and I will tarry with you till the latest moment. The captain of the vessel
  will be here presently, and I expect some other friends. You must give us a
  good supper&mdash;look well after me&mdash;take care there are no unlicensed
  intruders&mdash;you understand?&mdash;and some day I will requite your
  devotion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All shall be done as your Majesty desires,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll see to the supper, your Majesty,&rdquo; added Mrs.
  Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough, my good friends,&rdquo; rejoined Charles. &ldquo;Rise both
  of you. As to you, Joan,&rdquo; he continued, drawing her towards him,
  &ldquo;your husband will not be jealous, I am sure, if I venture to press
  those tempting lips.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! take as many kisses as you please, sire! Your Majesty is
  heartily welcome!&rdquo; cried Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not the first time I have kissed your dame, my good
  host,&rdquo; said Charles, laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not the first time by a score, an please your Majesty!&rdquo;
  replied the hostess, dropping a grateful curtsey. &ldquo;I have often told
  Smith how the merry young prince used to chase me along the corridor. Ah!
  those were happy times!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nouns! wife, the good times will come back, thou mayst rest
  assured,&rdquo; cried Smith. &ldquo;The king will enjoy his own again, and
  then, &lsquo;sbodikins! I shall be a lord, and thou wilt be a lady, Joan!
  thou wilt be a lady! Which nobody can deny! which nobody can deny!&rdquo; And
  he sang and capered about the room in so droll a manner, that both Charles
  and Colonel Gunter were ready to die with laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now my turn to call you to your senses, hubby,&rdquo;
  cried Mrs. Smith, forcibly restraining him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear some
  one calling you outside?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gadzooks! so I do,&rdquo; rejoined Smith, pausing. &ldquo;Coming,
  sir&mdash;coming! You&rsquo;ll be a lady, my duck. Which nobody can
  deny!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the voice of a friend,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;You may
  admit him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will it please you to step in here, sir?&rdquo; cried Smith.
  &ldquo;Nouns! wife, if it isn&rsquo;t Lord Wilmot!&rdquo; he added, as his
  lordship entered the room. &ldquo;Only to think that the George should be
  thus honoured! Henceforth the house shall be called the King&rsquo;s
  Head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better wait till the king is safe upon the throne,&rdquo; replied
  his prudent spouse, in a whisper. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to offend the
  roundhead Commonwealth knaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are right, my dear&mdash;you are always right. Which nobody can
  deny!&rdquo; he replied, in the same tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will rejoice to find, my lord, that I have again fallen amongst
  friends,&rdquo; said Charles to Lord Wilmot. &ldquo;These good folks are old
  acquaintances, and belonged to the king my father&rsquo;s household at
  Whitehall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I congratulate you on your good fortune, my liege,&rdquo; replied
  his lordship. &ldquo;Nay, I think I remember them. That should be Bonfellow
  Smith, and, unless I am greatly mistaken, this must be pretty Joan Awbray, my
  lady&rsquo;s own tirewoman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your lordship is right in both instances,&rdquo; said the host.
  &ldquo;But the somewhile Joan Awbray is now Mrs. Bonfellow Smith, at your
  lordship&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After his lordship had passed a few compliments upon Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s
  improved appearance, and expressed his satisfaction at seeing her husband
  again, Charles gave the worthy couple a good-natured hint to withdraw, and
  they both left the room, renewing their protestations of devotion, and
  promising that all needful precautions should be taken for his
  Majesty&rsquo;s security.</p>

  <p>They had not been gone more than five minutes when heavy footsteps were
  heard outside, and a hoarse voice was heard inquiring if Master William
  Jackson was in the house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There he is! that&rsquo;s Captain Tattersall,&rdquo; cried Colonel
  Gunter, flying to the door. &ldquo;This way, captain,&rdquo; he added.
  &ldquo;Here we are! here&rsquo;s Mr. Jackson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On this summons Tattersall entered the room. His apparel was pretty nearly
  the same as that in which he appeared on a former occasion, except that he
  now wore a pair of heavy boots. He brought with him a great bundle of
  seamen&rsquo;s attire, of which the host, who had followed him into the room,
  hastened to relieve him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, put those traps down, mine host,&rdquo; cried the skipper;
  &ldquo;or, harkye, you had best convey them to some chamber above stairs.
  Mayhap they&rsquo;ll be wanted by- and-by. Good e&rsquo;en to you,
  gentlemen&mdash;good e&rsquo;en to you,&rdquo; he added, bowing to the
  company. While doing so, he fixed a scrutinizing look upon the two strangers,
  and appeared particularly struck by the king&rsquo;s appearance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Captain Tattersall,&rdquo; cried Colonel Gunter,
  clapping him on the shoulder. &ldquo;You are as punctual as the clock. This
  is my friend, Mr. Barlow, captain,&rdquo; indicating Lord Wilmot, &ldquo;and
  this is Mr. William Jackson,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Barlow and Jackson, eh!&rdquo; exclaimed the skipper, placing his
  finger on the side of his nose. &ldquo;Two very good travelling names though
  Smith might be better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is Smith, I beg to observe, Captain Tattersall,&rdquo;
  remarked the host&mdash;&ldquo;Bonfellow Smith. Which nobody can
  deny!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, I had forgotten that,&rdquo; replied Tattersall,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring pipes, Spanish tobacco, ale and brandy&mdash;Nantz,
  d&rsquo;ye mark, host,&rdquo; cried Colonel Gunter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your honour shall be served in a trice,&rdquo; replied Smith,
  disappearing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray be seated, Captain Tattersall&mdash;pray be seated,&rdquo;
  said Charles. &ldquo;There will be no difficulty about our passage, I
  suppose, captain? You are very particular, I hear. But I hope our looks
  satisfy you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your looks are very much in your favour with me, Mr.
  Jackson,&rdquo; the skipper replied, significantly, &ldquo;though they
  mightn&rsquo;t please every other shipmaster equally well. But I think I have
  seen you before, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;Where, and when, captain?
  I don&rsquo;t recollect the occasion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Possibly not, sir,&rdquo; returned the skipper. &ldquo;But I have
  good reason to remember it. It was in the year 1648&mdash;three years ago,
  Heaven save the mark&mdash;that the royal fleet, under the command of his
  Royal Highness Prince Charles, suddenly appeared off this coast, and captured
  several sloops, fishing-vessels, and other craft&mdash;my brig, the
  Swiftsure, being amongst the number.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you were made prisoner?&rdquo; cried the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was made prisoner,&rdquo; replied the skipper, &ldquo;and with
  several of my fellow shipmasters was brought before the young prince. And
  what do you think his Royal Highness did?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;Treated
  you like rebels, it may be?&mdash;ordered you all to be handcuffed and placed
  below the hatches?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; rejoined Tattersall. &ldquo;The only
  punishment he inflicted upon us was to make each of us toss off a glass of
  brandy to his royal father&rsquo;s health, and then&mdash;bless his noble
  heart!&mdash;he set us all free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish! that&rsquo;s rather like him, I must say,&rdquo; observed
  Charles. &ldquo;He has been doing foolish things all his life&mdash;eh,
  Barlow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly true, Mr. Jackson,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t look upon this as a foolish thing,&rdquo; said
  Tattersall. &ldquo;Leastways, his clemency wasn&rsquo;t thrown away upon me,
  for I vowed then, that if ever opportunity offered, I&rsquo;d show my
  gratitude, and I&rsquo;ll be as good as my word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Delighted to hear you say so, Captain Tattersall,&rdquo; observed
  the king. &ldquo;The feeling is very creditable to you. But I don&rsquo;t see
  how I am connected with the circumstance you have related.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are friends of Csar, I believe?&rdquo; said Tattersall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All friends of Csar, captain,&rdquo; replied the host, bringing in
  a bottle of brandy and glasses, while his wife followed with pipes and
  tobacco. &ldquo;Mrs. Bonfellow Smith is Csar&rsquo;s particular friend.
  Which nobody can deny!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He always was fond of the lasses,&rdquo; said Tattersall, laughing.
  &ldquo;Give me a glass of brandy, sirrah host. As I told you just now, I
  drank to the late king&rsquo;s health by command of the noble prince, his
  son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that was upon compulsion,&rdquo; observed Charles, &ldquo;and
  must have gone against the grain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It went no more against the grain than the pledge I am about to
  drink now,&rdquo; rejoined the skipper. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the noble
  young prince who gave me freedom, and by the act bound me to him by ties of
  everlasting gratitude! Here&rsquo;s to him who ought to wear the crown of
  England, only rogues have dispossessed him of it. Here&rsquo;s to my royal
  master&mdash;for I acknowledge no other, except the Master above!&mdash;and
  may he soon be out of the reach of his enemies, and it shan&rsquo;t be Nick
  Tattersall&rsquo;s fault if he be not so.&rdquo; So saying, he drained the
  glass to the last drop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oddsfish! Tattersall,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;you were
  represented to me as a half- Republican, but I find you a thorough-going
  Royalist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whatever flag I may be obliged to hoist, my true colours are the
  king&rsquo;s colours, and those I wear next my heart,&rdquo; replied
  Tattersall. &ldquo;And now to cut matters short, since all&rsquo;s settled,
  I&rsquo;ll make bold to tell your Majesty what I think had best be done. You
  may have noticed that I brought a bundle of seamen&rsquo;s clothes with me.
  Let me recommend your Majesty, and your fellow- passenger that is to be, to
  rig yourselves out in the gear. You will find a suit apiece, so that in case
  of any unexpected hindrance&mdash;as you have no passes, and might be
  stopped&mdash;you can go on board as part of my crew. The brig will slip her
  moorings, and get out of the harbour two hours after midnight, and will lie
  off shore in waiting for us. I&rsquo;ve got a boat to take us to her. I
  don&rsquo;t anticipate any difficulty, but it&rsquo;s best to be on the safe
  side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you, Tattersall,&rdquo; replied Charles.
  &ldquo;You have shown great forethought. I ought to have introduced Lord
  Wilmot to you. (Tattersall bowed.) His lordship and I will at once proceed to
  change our attire. Colonel Gunter will attend to your wants in the interim,
  and ere you have smoked your first pipe we will be back with you, fully
  equipped in the habiliments you have so thoughtfully provided for
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, his Majesty and Lord Wilmot quitted the room, preceded by the
  hostess, bearing a light.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9-3"
     name="ch9-3">CHAPTER III<br>
  Introducing Two Of Captain Tattersall&rsquo;s Crew</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;AND now, Captain Tattersall,&rdquo; said Gunter, as
  soon as they were alone, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll settle our accounts, if you
  please. Here&rsquo;s the other half of the passage- money&mdash;fifty
  caroluses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, a bargain&rsquo;s a bargain, colonel,&rdquo; replied the
  skipper, bestowing the bag of gold in his jacket; &ldquo;but if you had only
  spoken plainly at first, and told me who wanted a passage with me, I would
  have placed my vessel at his Majesty&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame me for acting cautiously in a case of such
  importance, captain,&rdquo; Gunter replied. &ldquo;And pardon me for saying
  that I didn&rsquo;t know you so well as I do now. Besides, you richly deserve
  all you&rsquo;ve got, and more, and I trust this matter will be the making of
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope to Heaven it may, colonel!&rdquo; replied Tattersall.
  &ldquo;Howsomever, as I said before, if I save his Majesty it&rsquo;ll be
  reward enough for me. I&rsquo;ll have it written on my tombstone, &lsquo;Here
  lies Nick Tattersall, who faithfully preserved his king.&rsquo; Moreover, if
  I accomplish this voyage securely, I&rsquo;ll change the name of my ship, and
  call her the Royal Escape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An excellent name,&rdquo; said Gunter, filling a pipe with tobacco
  and lighting it, while the skipper followed his example; &ldquo;and I hope
  your brig will earn a title to it. The wind is favourable, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, the wind is nor&rsquo;-east, and if it holds where it
  is&mdash;and I feel pretty sure it will&mdash;we shall have a quick run
  across to Fcamp, near Havre-de-Grace, in Normandy, for that&rsquo;s the port
  I mean to make for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fcamp, eh? I fancied you would have tried for Dieppe. But the port
  matters not, provided you land his Majesty safely in
  France&mdash;that&rsquo;s the main point. I hope you won&rsquo;t fall in with
  any cruisers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope we shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rejoined the skipper, puffing away
  at his pipe, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t much afeared of &lsquo;em. The
  Swiftsure&lsquo;ll show &lsquo;em a light pair of heels; and if they do
  overhaul us, they&rsquo;ll take the king and his lordship for part o&rsquo;
  the crew. What I should least like to meet would be one of them
  rattlin&rsquo; Ostend privateers, which, ever since the war broke out betwixt
  France and Spain, have been hoverin&rsquo; about the French coast, on the
  look-out for prizes. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to meet one o&rsquo; them ugly
  customers, for they might plunder us, and set us ashore in
  England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sdeath! that would be a mishap indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Gunter. &ldquo;But let us hope for the best. Heaven, that has preserved the
  king through so many dangers, won&rsquo;t desert him at the last. But
  what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he added, as exclamations and laughter, proceeding
  from the hostess, were heard outside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if two of my crew have arrived,
  colonel,&rdquo; replied Tattersall, with a wink. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
  expectin&rsquo; &lsquo;em. Ay, here they come!&rdquo; he cried, as the door
  was thrown open by the hostess, who was laughing immoderately, and two
  rollicking individuals, with the gait, gestures, looks, and attire of seamen
  of the period&mdash;that is to say, blue jackets and brown slops, Guernsey
  shirts and red caps, like the skipper himself&mdash;rolled, rather than
  walked, into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re enough to deceive a body to one s very
  face!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Smith, holding up her hands in admiration.
  &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know better, I should take &lsquo;em for real
  sailors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Real sailors!&rdquo; cried Charles, chucking her under the chin;
  &ldquo;so we be, my pretty hostess&mdash;reg&rsquo;lar jack-tars, I can
  promise ye. I say, capt&rsquo;n, put in a word for us, will ye? How long have
  my messmate Tom Barlow and I sailed wi&rsquo; ye i&rsquo; the
  Swiftsure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ever since 1648, Will Jackson,&rdquo; replied Tattersall, emitting
  a long puff of tobacco. &ldquo;But sit down, my lads&mdash;sit down. Take a
  glass of grog, and smoke a pipe. Don&rsquo;t mind me&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
  partic&rsquo;lar when ashore. This gentleman, I dare say, won&rsquo;t mind
  ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; replied Gunter. &ldquo;Sit down, my lads,
  I beg of you. These are two stout fellows, capt&rsquo;n, especially Tom
  Barlow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, he&rsquo;s big enough in all conscience,&rdquo; said
  Tattersall, remarking that Lord Wilmot&rsquo;s breadth of shoulder and
  athletic proportions seemed materially increased by his change of costume;
  &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re both able-bodied rascals. Harkye, hostess, give
  &lsquo;em each a glass of brandy, and fill a pipe for Will Jackson with this
  prime Spanish tobacco. He&rsquo;s too bashful to help himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shiver my timbers, but she shall do nothing of the sort!&rdquo;
  cried the king. &ldquo;She shan&rsquo;t turn her pretty fingers into tobacco
  stoppers. A hand like this was never made for such work.&rdquo; And he
  pressed it gallantly to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oons, Will, I was wrong, it seems, in callin&rsquo; thee
  bashful,&rdquo; observed Tattersall, laughing. &ldquo;Thou seem&rsquo;st free
  and easy enough now, I must say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I declare if it ben&rsquo;t just like a play!&rdquo;
  exclaimed Mrs. Smith, delighted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope our comedy mayn&rsquo;t take a serious turn!&rdquo;
  exclaimed Colonel Gunter, uneasily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he
  added, as the tramping of horses, accompanied by the clattering of arms, was
  heard in the inn-yard. Cautiously lifting the edge of the curtain, he peeped
  forth, and immediately afterwards cried out in alarm, &ldquo;The Iron-sides
  are upon us! Half a dozen or more of them are in the yard&mdash;and some are
  dismounting. We shall have them here in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, preserve us! What&rsquo;ll become of the king?&rdquo; cried
  the hostess, almost sinking with fright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, Joan!&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;My safety will depend a
  good deal upon your composure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All had started to their feet except the young monarch, who completely
  maintained his self-possession.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down all of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you, Wilmot, feign
  to be drunk&mdash;sleepily drunk, d&rsquo;ye understand? Gunter, you must
  play the Puritan&mdash;you can act the part to the life, if you choose. I
  shall be as drunk as Wilmot&mdash;but wide awake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this moment Bonfellow Smith rushed into the room exclaiming,
  distractedly,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The troopers are here! the troopers are here! What&rsquo;s to be
  done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; rejoined his wife. &ldquo;Go and see what they are
  about! We are all prepared for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Overcoming his fright as well as he could, Smith left the room, and
  presently after ominous sounds were heard without, announcing that sentinels
  were being posted at the doors of the hostel with orders to shoot any one who
  might attempt to escape. A stern voice was then heard in the passage, holding
  a brief colloquy with the host, after which the door was thrown open, and a
  sergeant of Ironsides, in full accoutrements, with pistols in belt and drawn
  sword in hand, strode into the room, followed by three others, armed with
  carabines. Poor Bonfellow Smith did not venture further than the doorway,
  where he stood a terrified spectator of the scene, his naturally rosy
  countenance having become as white as his own apron.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a great change had taken place in the appearance of three of
  the personages at the table. Lord Wilmot appeared to be fast asleep, with his
  head upon the board, and Charles, to judge from his looks, was completely
  overcome by liquor. Never was the appearance of a drunken man better
  simulated than by the king&mdash;head hanging down&mdash;eyes half shut, and
  stupid in expression&mdash;limbs wholly unequal to their office, since their
  owner could apparently neither rise from his chair nor guide the pipe to his
  lips. Colonel Gunter had put on a black skull-cap and spectacles, and
  smoothed down his bands. By elongating his features, he managed to give them
  a decidedly Puritanical expression.</p>

  <p>Delves (for he was the sergeant of Ironsides in question) marched towards
  the group at the table. Colonel Gunter and Tattersall rose at his approach,
  but the other two remained as we have described them, except that Charles
  apparently made an effort to get up, and failing totally, seemed to maintain
  his balance in the chair with difficulty. Delves, though regarding him at
  first with suspicion, could evidently make nothing of him, but turning his
  attention to Lord Wilmot, seized him by the shoulder, and shook him lustily.
  Thus roused, his lordship looked up for a moment with the vacant stare of an
  intoxicated man, and then laid his head down again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are these drunken fellows?&rdquo; demanded Delves of
  Tattersall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two of my crew,&rdquo; replied the skipper, &ldquo;and both, I am
  sorry to say, the worse for liquor, as you can scarce fail to
  perceive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is only too apparent,&rdquo; replied the sergeant, with a look
  of infinite disgust. &ldquo;How art thou named, friend?&rdquo; he added to
  the skipper. &ldquo;Thy calling I can pretty well guess at.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no reason to be ashamed either of my name or calling,&rdquo;
  replied Tattersall, bluffly. &ldquo;I am Nicholas Tattersall, captain of the
  Swiftsure, now lying in Shoreham harbour. My papers are all regular, if you
  desire to look at them,&rdquo; he added, producing a packet from his
  breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I care not to see them,&rdquo; replied Delves. &ldquo;I am
  satisfied with what you tell me. But mark me, Nicholas Tattersall. Certain
  intelligence has reached me that the Young Man Charles Stuart is in this
  neighbourhood, and is seeking to obtain passage in some vessel across the
  Channel. Take heed thou aidest him not, or thou wilt be hanged as a
  traitor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hanged, quotha!&mdash;hang our captain!&rdquo; hiccupped Charles.
  Not while Will Jackson can lift an arm (hiccup). If any man touches our
  capt&rsquo;n (hiccup), I&rsquo;ll smash him like this pipe,&rdquo; breaking
  the pipe to pieces upon the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ought to put these two drunkards in irons, and give them a
  round dozen apiece in the morning,&rdquo; said Delves, angrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must take a lesson from your service,&rdquo; rejoined Tattersall.
  &ldquo;You are strict enough, I make no doubt. Yet methinks I have heard of
  some delinquencies on the part of the troopers at Ovingdean
  Grange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will never occur again,&rdquo; said Delves, somewhat abashed.
  &ldquo;But there is one person here whom I have not yet questioned. Thy name
  and station?&rdquo; he added to Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;Take care thou dost
  not equivocate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had best not equivocate with you, sergeant, that I can see
  plainly enough,&rdquo; replied Gunter. &ldquo;My name is Seek-the-Fold
  Stray-Not Lamb&mdash;Four-Year-Old South- Down Mutton, the profane are wont
  to call me in derision. I am a Muggletonian, and hold forth at the
  conventicle in Ship-Street. If thou doubtest me, sergeant, appeal to the
  host.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art mocking me, I suspect, friend,&rdquo; said Delves,
  sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hath spoken falsely, sergeant,&rdquo; said Nathan Guestling, who
  was one of the troopers standing behind. &ldquo;He hath already been a
  prisoner in our hands. It is the man whom our captain chased across the downs
  on that unlucky night, and brought back a prisoner to Ovingdean. Pluck the
  spectacles from off his nose, and the cap from off his head, and thou wilt
  instantly recognize him. I knew him at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou art right, Nathan!&mdash;it is he!&rdquo; exclaimed Delves.
  &ldquo;I am glad we shall not go away empty-handed. Thou art my
  prisoner,&rdquo; he added to Colonel Gunter; &ldquo;come forth, or my men
  will fire upon thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I will come peaceably,&rdquo; replied Gunter, stepping
  forward.</p>

  <p>Nathan Guestling and Besadaiah (for the latter also was present) placed
  themselves one on either side of the prisoner, and in this manner he was led
  out of the room. But just as he was going forth he whispered to the landlord
  that he felt certain of a rescue, and would be back again ere long. Shortly
  afterwards, a trampling in the inn-yard announced the departure of the
  troopers, and the host came in to say they were gone&mdash;though the
  satisfactory intelligence was somewhat damped by the thought that Colonel
  Gunter had been carried off a captive.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9-4"
     name="ch9-4">CHAPTER IV<br>
  Containing Particulars Of The Conflict On Kingston Hill,<br>
  And Of The Embarkation At Shoreham</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLES would have been greatly troubled by the loss of his
  faithful adherent, had he not felt almost certain that Gunter would be
  rescued by Clavering and the other Royalists hovering about the town, and
  that he should see him again before he started for Shoreham. Lord Wilmot was
  also of the same opinion. Whatever Tattersall might secretly think of the
  chances in the colonel&rsquo;s favour he kept his sentiments to himself, and
  continued to puff away at his pipe; but the host and hostess were loud in
  their expressions of delight at his Majesty&rsquo;s providential escape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I owe my safety entirely to Captain Tattersall,&rdquo; observed
  Charles. &ldquo;Had he not brought these disguises with him, Lord Wilmot and
  I should have been infallibly detected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was lucky I thought of them,&rdquo; replied Tattersall,
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, a very nice little supper was placed on the table by
  the hostess, to which both the monarch and his companions did ample justice.
  A glass or two of choice canary, poured out for him by Mrs. Smith, quickly
  dispelled the king&rsquo;s gloom, and before the repast was over he had
  regained his customary spirits, and was laughing and talking as merrily as
  ever. As soon as the table was cleared, pipes and tobacco were again
  introduced. A jug of cold water and a bottle of right Nantz were placed near
  Captain Tattersall, but Charles and Lord Wilmot confined their potations to
  canary. As it was now getting late, and all the other guests in the house had
  long since left, the inn doors were locked, and the servants, who were no
  longer required, were sent to bed. By his Majesty&rsquo;s special invitation,
  the host and hostess joined the party in the parlour, and it was ever
  afterwards a subject of infinite gratulation to them that they had been
  allowed to sit down in his Majesty&rsquo;s presence. Captain Tattersall, who
  was of a jovial turn, did his best to amuse the company&mdash;sang nautical
  ballads, and related droll incidents in his own career, at which the king
  laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>In this way time passed quickly away. It had now struck one o&rsquo;clock.
  Nothing had been heard of Clavering Maunsel and his party, and Charles almost
  began to despair of seeing Colonel Gunter again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In another hour your Majesty will be thinking of starting, I
  presume,&rdquo; observed Tattersall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Charles, looking at the clock; &ldquo;I did
  not think it was so late. But I hope our friends will be here before
  then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are here now, or I am much mistaken,&rdquo; cried Lord Wilmot,
  starting up, as the sound of horses&rsquo; feet was heard in the
  inn-yard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look out, and make sure that the Ironsides have not
  returned,&rdquo; said Charles.</p>

  <p>His lordship obeyed, and after cautiously peering through the
  window-curtain, declared it was Clavering Maunsel and the others. &ldquo;And
  I am almost certain Gunter is with them,&rdquo; added his lordship.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now heaven be thanked!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles. &ldquo;That is
  good news indeed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this moment, a cautious knocking was heard at the yard door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Admit them straight, my good host,&rdquo; cried the king. And Smith
  flew to execute his Majesty&rsquo;s commands.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards quick footsteps were heard in the passage, and
  Colonel Gunter and Clavering entered the room. They were followed in another
  moment by Colonel Philips and Captain Gunter, and three other persons, who
  remained in the background.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am as good as my word, you see, my gracious liege,&rdquo; said
  Colonel Gunter. &ldquo;I promised to be back before your Majesty left, and
  here I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And delighted I am to see you again,&rdquo; replied the king.
  &ldquo;But how did you manage to escape from those rascally
  Ironsides?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friends rescued me, as I felt sure they would,&rdquo; rejoined
  Gunter, pointing to Clavering and the others; &ldquo;but they had hard work
  to do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it would seem,&rdquo; replied Charles, noticing that the young
  man and those near him bore marks of a recent and severe conflict.
  &ldquo;Tell me how it chanced?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty has some enemies the less,&rdquo; replied Clavering.
  &ldquo;But you have lost one faithful subject,&rdquo; he added, gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, glancing at the group in the
  background. &ldquo;I discover not stout John Habergeon. Is he
  gone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, my liege,&rdquo; Clavering replied. &ldquo;He died like a brave
  and loyal man, sword in hand, smiting the enemies of his king. Thus it fell
  out: I and those with me were aware of the visit of the Iron-sides to this
  inn, for we were scouting about the town; but we did not think it prudent to
  attack them, lest the townsfolk should come to their aid. Ensconced where we
  could observe them, we saw them issue forth with a single prisoner&mdash;your
  Majesty we feared it might be. But be it whom it might, we resolved upon a
  rescue. I ought to mention, that we had been joined by three recruits, two of
  whom are here present, and who rendered us good service. The Ironsides left
  Brightelmstone, and rode across the downs in the direction of Lewes. We
  followed, but did not come up with them until they reached Kingston Hill. We
  then shouted loudly to them to stop, and they drew up and awaited our
  approach. Sword in hand we charged them&mdash;your name, my liege, forming
  our battle-cry. So furious was our assault that it proved irresistible. The
  shock scattered them, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensued&mdash;such a
  conflict as, since the days of the old Romans, I verily believe that hill
  hath never seen- The turf is reddened with the blood of your enemies, sire.
  We were triumphant. Half a dozen Ironsides now lie stark upon Kingston Hill.
  Amongst them, alas! is John Habergeon. But he sold his life dearly. Three of
  our foemen&mdash;their sergeant Delves being among the number&mdash;fell by
  his hand. Give me a glass of wine, my good hostess. I am somewhat
  faint.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That task be mine,&rdquo; cried Charles, filling a glass for him.
  &ldquo;You have gained a glorious victory, but I would it had not been
  purchased by the death of John Habergeon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He died as he would have wished to die&mdash;with your
  Majesty&rsquo;s name upon his lips,&rdquo; rejoined Clavering.</p>

  <p>Charles was silent for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;A brave fellow is
  gone, but he has left good men behind him. I am glad to see that Ninian Saxby
  has escaped unhurt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not altogether unhurt, an please your majesty,&rdquo; replied
  Ninian, stepping forward. &ldquo;I have received a few sharp cuts, but
  nothing to signify. I gave the Roundheaded rogues as good as they
  brought,&mdash;and better!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt it not,&rdquo; said Charles, smiling. &ldquo;Thou art a
  brave lad. But what do I see? Surely these are the gentlemen whom I met at
  Steyning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty is in the right,&rdquo; replied Goldspur, coming
  forward and making an obeisance. &ldquo;I and my friend Jervoise Rumboldsdyke
  have been anxious to approve our loyalty, and at length we have found
  occasion for doing so. Mr. Clavering Maunsel will declare whether we have
  comported ourselves well or not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Both gentlemen behaved with great bravery, sire,&rdquo; said
  Clavering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I only wish I
  could reward you according to your deserts. But my exchequer is pretty much
  in the same state as your own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our exchequer is better furnished than your Majesty
  supposes,&rdquo; rejoined Goldspur; &ldquo;that is, it will be so
  to-morrow,&rdquo; he added, correcting himself. &ldquo;A rascally porter,
  named Skrow Antram, who served old Zachary Trangmar, the rich usurer of
  Lewes, joined us this evening, and was shot in the fight on Kingston Hill.
  With his dying breath he confessed to me and my friend Rumboldsdyke that he
  had robbed the old usurer his master, and told us where he had hidden the
  gold. To-morrow we shall visit old Zachary, and make a bargain with him for
  the discovery of the treasure. The old usurer must come down handsomely, for
  his porter had purloined a good round sum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well resolved,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;I am sure you will
  not make yourselves accomplices of the rogue Antram, and sully your honour as
  Cavaliers by appropriating the treasure. And now, Captain Tattersall, there
  is no need to tarry longer here. Let us to Shoreham. These gentlemen will go
  with us, and constitute my escort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am at your Majesty&rsquo;s disposal,&rdquo; replied the
  skipper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, then, my worthy host and hostess,&rdquo; said Charles.
  &ldquo;Rest assured I shall often think of the eventful night I have spent at
  the George at Brightelmstone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall venture to remind your Majesty of it one of these
  days,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall not need, my good fellow; nor you, my buxom Joan. Harkye,
  gentlemen, he amongst you who has the stoutest horse must give Captain
  Tattersall a seat behind him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I will take him,&rdquo; said Colonel Philips, &ldquo;for I am
  well mounted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me thy purse, Wilmot,&rdquo; said the king. And on receiving
  it, he took forth five gold pieces, and placed them in the hostess&rsquo;s
  hands. &ldquo;There is for the reckoning, bonny Joan. One kiss at parting,
  and then adieu!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charles then left the room, and was attended to the yard by both host and
  hostess, neither of whom would leave him till he took his departure. Honest
  Smith prayed that every blessing might attend his Majesty, coupled with a
  hope that the George might speedily be again honoured by his presence. Mrs.
  Smith&rsquo;s sobs prevented her from saying anything. At length all the
  party were mounted, Captain Tattersall being accommodated with a seat behind
  Colonel Philips. The king then gave the word to start, and bade adieu to the
  host and hostess, giving his hand to the latter, who bathed it with her
  tears, while pressing it to her lips.</p>

  <p>The cavalcade being then put in motion, took the road along the coast
  through Hove. It was a fine, clear, starlight night, with the wind blowing
  freshly from the north-east. In little more than half an hour the troop
  approached Shoreham, no misadventure or hindrance of any kind having occurred
  to them. Captain Tattersall now directed the king&rsquo;s attention to a
  vessel which could just be distinguished lying out at sea, at about a quarter
  of a mile&rsquo;s distance, and informed him it was the Swiftsure.</p>

  <p>A halt was then called. Charles dismounted, and bade adieu to his
  followers, thanking them all warmly for their services, and saying something
  kindly to each. His last words were reserved for Clavering Maunsel. Bidding
  the young man remember him to his father, he added, &ldquo;And fail not to
  commend me to good Mr. Beard and fair Mistress Dulcia. Ere long, I hope to
  hear of your union with the object of your wishes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By this time Lord Wilmot and Captain Tattersall had dismounted. The
  skipper then walked on in advance, leaving the king and his lordship to
  follow. After crossing a heavy bank of shingle, they reached the edge of a
  little creek divided by an outer bank from the sea. Tattersall then gave a
  low whistle, in reply to which the sound of oars was heard, and a boat was
  seen advancing from under the shade of the opposite bank. This boat, which
  was manned by a couple of stout-looking seamen, soon touched the strand. The
  king and Lord Wilmot leaped into it, and were quickly followed by Tattersall,
  who seated himself in the stern. The men then plying their oars briskly, the
  boat was soon out of the creek, and cleaving its way through the sea.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes more they were beside the Swiftsure. Charles sprang up the
  vessel&rsquo;s side as actively as any seaman could have performed the feat,
  and was followed by the two others, while the boat pulled off again to shore.
  The king then looked towards the group of horsemen, whom he could dimly
  discern on the beach and a joyful shout reached his ears.</p>

  <p>The brig then stood out to sea, and Charles was safely landed on the
  morning of the following day at Fcamp.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="env">L&rsquo;ENVOY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE king&rsquo;s recommendation was not neglected. Ere the
year was out,
  Clavering was made happy with the hand of the fair Dulcia, and had no reason
  to repent his choice.</p>

  <p>Charles, we need scarcely say, had to wait nine years for the Restoration,
  and long before that auspicious event, Colonel Maunsel was gathered to his
  fathers. But good Mr. Beard lived to be reinstated in his living, and again
  officiated in the little village church. He took for the text of the first
  sermon preached by him on resuming his duties, these verses from the 129th
  Psalm: &ldquo;The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their
  furrows.&mdash;The Lord is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
  wicked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clavering and Dulcia continued to reside at Ovingdean Grange to the close
  of their days, which extended in both instances into another century. Though
  the Maunsel family is now extinct in the direct line, worthy representatives
  are left&mdash;both at Rottingdean and Lewes&mdash;of the good old stock of
  the BEARDS. And we may add, that the old house at Ovingdean still belongs to
  a branch of the same family.</p>

  <p>Stelfax, at that time a colonel in the Guards, and in high favour with
  Monk, formed part of the royal escort from Blackheath, on the glorious 29th
  of May, 1660, when the king made his triumphal entry into London. Charles
  particularly distinguished him, and good-humouredly observed, &ldquo;Have you
  forgotten the half- hour we spent together in the hiding-place at Ovingdean,
  colonel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have forgotten all, except your Majesty&rsquo;s
  generosity,&rdquo; replied Stelfax, bending to the saddle-bow. He was
  already, we may perceive, a courtier.</p>

  <p>Ninian Saxby became the fortunate possessor of Patty Whinchat, and was
  blessed with a numerous progeny. After his father&rsquo;s death he filled the
  post of ostreger to Clavering, who grew passionately fond of all country
  sports. Some of Ninian&rsquo;s descendants, we believe, may be found in the
  neighbourhood of Ovingdean to this day.</p>

  <p>The body of stout old John Habergeon was removed from Kingston Hill, and
  buried in the village churchyard. Peace be with him!</p>

  <p>Captain Tattersall received a considerable sum for his services. Moreover,
  a pension of a hundred a year was settled upon him and his descendants; and
  he was likewise presented with a handsome ring by the grateful monarch. Would
  you know more of the worthy skipper&rsquo;s virtues, go seek his monument in
  the old parish churchyard at Brighton! There you may read the following
  epitaph:</p>

  <p class="poem">Within this marble monument doth lie<br>
  Approved faith, honour, and loyalty.<br>
  In this cold clay he now has ta&rsquo;en his station,<br>
  That once preserved the church, the crown, and nation.<br>
  When Charles the great was nothing but a breath,<br>
  This valiant soul stept between him and death.<br>
  Usurpers&rsquo; threats and tyrant rebels&rsquo; frown<br>
  Could not affright his virtue to the Crown;<br>
  Which glorious act of his for church and state<br>
  Eight princes in one day did gratulate;<br>
  Professing all to him in debt to be,<br>
  As all the world are to his memory.<br></p>

  <p>Bonfellow Smith had gone the way of all flesh before that most festive
  time, when&mdash;to the infinite satisfaction of all
  landlords&mdash;universal England drunk did get&mdash;</p>

  <p>For joy that Charles, her monarch, was restored.</p>

  <p>But his still buxom widow at once took down the old sign of the George,
  and set up in its place King Charles the Second&rsquo;s Head.</p>

  <p>If Clavering&rsquo;s services were not more fully requited, it was his own
  fault rather than that of his sovereign. Charles endeavoured to persuade him
  to quit his seclusion and come to court, offering him knighthood. But he was
  too happy at Ovingdean Grange to leave it, and respectfully declined the
  honour. By this time he had become, what he continued to remain to the
  last,</p>

  <p class="cp">A fishing, hawking, hunting, Country Gentleman.</p>
