  <h2><a id="fore"
     name="fore"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p class="first">On a certain day in the year of grace 1920, there came into
being a
  special and very select club. There was no entrance fee and no subscription,
  in which respect it differed from all other clubs. Its membership was limited
  to six: the <i>Actor</i>, the <i>Barrister</i>, the <i>Doctor</i>, the
  <i>Ordinary Man</i>, the <i>Soldier</i>, and the <i>Writer</i>. And since
  each in his own particular trade had achieved what the world calls fame,
  except the Ordinary Man, who was only ordinary, it was decided that for
  purposes of convenience they should be entered in the list of members
  alphabetically according to their trade, and further that they should carry
  out the only rule of the club in the order of that entry. And the only rule
  of the club was, that on certain nights, to be mutually agreed on, the member
  whose turn it was should give to the remaining members an exceedingly good
  dinner, after which he should tell them a story connected with his own trade,
  that should be of sufficient interest to keep them awake.</p>

  <p>And the only penalty of the club was that if the story was not of
  sufficient interest to keep the audience awake, the offending member should
  pay a sum of ten pounds to a deserving charity.</p>

  <p>No rule was deemed necessary as to the quality of the dinner: the members
  had elected themselves with discretion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE ACTOR'S STORY,<br>
  BEING THE PATCH ON THE QUILT</h2>

  <p class="first">"The trouble in my game," he began, "is that the greatest
plays can never
  be staged. There would be no money in them. The public demand a plot &mdash;
  a climax: after that the puppets cease strutting, the curtain rings down. But
  in life &mdash; in real life &mdash; there's no plot. It's just a series of
  anti-climaxes strung together like a patchwork quilt, until there comes the
  greatest anti-climax of all and the quilt is finished."</p>

  <p>He passed his hand through his fast-greying hair, and stared for a moment
  or two at the fire. The Soldier was filling his pipe; the Writer, his legs
  stretched in front of him, had his hands thrust deep in his trouser
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"It's one of the patches in one of the quilts that my story is about,"
  continued the actor thoughtfully. "Just an episode in the life of a woman
  &mdash; or shall I say, just the life of a woman in an episode?</p>

  <p>"You remember that play of mine &mdash; <i>John Pendlesham's Wife</i>?" He
  turned to the Barrister, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he answered. "Molly Travers was your leading lady."</p>

  <p>"I was out of England," said the Soldier. "Never saw it."</p>

  <p>"It's immaterial." The Actor lit a cigarette. "The play itself has nothing
  to do with my story, except indirectly. But as you didn't see it, I will just
  explain this much. I, of course, was John Pendlesham &mdash; Molly was my
  wife, and the third act constituted what, in my opinion, was the finest piece
  of emotional acting which that consummate actress has ever done in her
  career."</p>

  <p>The Writer nodded. "I agree. She was superb."</p>

  <p>"Night after night the fall of the curtain found her nearly fainting;
  night after night there was that breathless moment of utter silence followed
  by a perfect crash of applause. I am mentioning these old facts because her
  marvellous performance does concern my story directly &mdash; even though the
  play does not.</p>

  <p>"We had been running about a month, I suppose, when my story begins. I had
  just come off after the third act, and was going to my dressing room. For
  some reason, instead of going by the direct door which led into it from the
  stage, I went outside into the passage. There were some hands moving
  furniture or something...</p>

  <p>"I think you've all of you been behind at my theatre. First you come to
  the swing doors out of the street, inside which the watch dog sits demanding
  callers' business. Then there is another door, and beyond that there are
  three steps down to my room. And it was just as I was opening my door on that
  night that I happened to look round.</p>

  <p>"Standing at the top of the three stairs was a woman who was staring at
  me. I only saw her for a moment: then the watch dog intervened, and I went
  into my room. But I <i>had</i> seen her for a moment: I had seen her for long
  enough to get the look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"We get all sorts and conditions of people behind, as you'd expect &mdash;
  stage-struck girls, actors out of a shop, autograph hunters, beggars. And the
  watch dog knew my invariable rule: only personal friends and people who had
  made an appointment by letter were allowed inside the second door. But a rule
  cannot legislate for every case.</p>

  <p>"Gad! you fellows, it's many years now since that night, but I can still
  feel, as clearly as if it were yesterday, the message in that girl's eyes.
  There had been hope and fear and pitiful entreaty: the look of one who had
  staked everything on a last desperate throw: the look of a mother who is
  fighting for her child. It was amazing: I couldn't understand it. As I stood
  just inside my door I couldn't have told you whether she was old or young,
  plain or pretty. And yet in that one fleeting second this vivid, jumbled
  message had reached me." The Actor pressed out his cigarette, and there was
  silence while he lit another one.</p>

  <p>"For a moment I hesitated," he continued after a while; "then I rang the
  bell for the watch dog.</p>

  <p>"'Who is that lady I saw outside there?' I asked, as he came in.</p>

  <p>"'Won't give no name, sir,' he answered. 'Wants to see you, but I told her
  the rules.'</p>

  <p>"Once again I hesitated; probably I'd exaggerated &mdash; put a totally
  false construction on her expression, probably she was looking for a job like
  the rest of them. And then I knew that I'd got to see that woman, and that I
  should have no peace of mind until I'd heard what she had to say. The watch
  dog was regarding me curiously; plainly he could see no reason whatever for
  my hesitation. He was a matter-of-fact fellow, was the guardian of the
  door.</p>

  <p>"'Show her in, I'll see her now.' I had my back to him, but I could feel
  his virtuous indignation. After all, rules are rules.</p>

  <p>"'Now, sir?' he echoed.</p>

  <p>"'Now; at once.'</p>

  <p>"He went out, and I heard him go up the steps.</p>

  <p>"'Mr Trayne will see you. Come this way.'</p>

  <p>"And then the door opened again, and I turned to face the woman. She was
  young &mdash; quite young, dressed in a kind of cheap suburban frock. Her
  shoes had been good ones &mdash; once, now &mdash; well, however skilfully a
  patch is put on it is still a patch. Her gloves showed traces of much needle
  and cotton; the little bag she carried was rubbed and frayed. And over the
  cheap suburban frock she had on a coat which was worn and threadbare.</p>

  <p>"'It was good of you to see me, Mr Trayne.'</p>

  <p>"She was nervous and her voice shook a little, but she faced me quite
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"'It's a very unusual thing for me to do,' I said. 'But I saw you at the
  top of the stairs, and...'</p>

  <p>"'I know it's unusual,' she interrupted. 'The man outside there told me
  your rule. But believe me' &mdash; she was talking with more assurance now
  &mdash; 'my reason for coming to see you is very unusual also.'</p>

  <p>"I pulled up a chair for her. 'What is your reason?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"She took a deep breath and began fumbling with her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"'I know you will think me mad,' she began, 'but I don't want to tell you
  my reason now. I want to wait until after the play is over, and I know you go
  on at once in the fourth act.'</p>

  <p>"'You've seen the play, then?' I remarked.</p>

  <p>"'I've seen the play,' was her somewhat astonishing answer, 'every night
  since the first.'</p>

  <p>"'Every night!' I stared at her in surprise. 'But...'</p>

  <p>"I must have glanced at her clothes or something and she saw what was in
  my mind.</p>

  <p>"'I suppose you think that I hardly look as if I could afford such
  luxuries.' She smiled faintly. 'I've only seen it from the gallery and pit,
  you know. And even that has meant that I've had to go without lunch. But
  &mdash; you see &mdash; it was necessary for me to see it: I had to. It was
  part of my plan &mdash; a necessary part.'</p>

  <p>"'I don't want to seem dense,' I said gently, 'but I'm afraid I don't
  quite follow. How can seeing my play thirty odd times be a necessary part of
  your plan?'</p>

  <p>"'That's what I don't want to tell you now,' she repeated, and once more
  her hands began twisting nervously. 'I want to wait till afterwards, when
  perhaps you'll &mdash; of your kindness &mdash; do as I ask you. Oh! Mr
  Trayne &mdash; for God's sake, don't fail me!' She leant forward beseechingly
  in her chair.</p>

  <p>"'My dear child,' I answered quietly &mdash; I don't think she can have
  been much more than twenty,' you haven't told me yet what you want me to
  do.'</p>

  <p>"'I want you to come to a house in Kensington with me,' she said
  steadily."</p>

  <p>Once again the Actor paused, and stared at the fire. Then he gave a short
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"When she said that, I looked at her pretty sharply. Without appearing
  conceited or anything of that sort, one has occasionally in the course of
  one's career, received certain flattering attentions from charming women
  &mdash; attentions which &mdash; er &mdash; one is tempted to conceal from
  one's wife."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," murmured the Ordinary Man. "Precisely."</p>

  <p>"And for a moment, I must confess that the thought passed through my mind
  that this was one of those occasions. And it wasn't until the colour rose to
  her face and stained it scarlet, that I realised that not only had I made a
  mistake, but that I had been foolish enough to let her see that I had.</p>

  <p>"'My God!' she whispered, 'you don't think &mdash; you couldn't think
  &mdash; that I meant...'</p>

  <p>"She rose and almost cowered away from me.</p>

  <p>"'Why, I'm married.'</p>

  <p>"I refrained from remarking that the fact was hardly such a conclusive
  proof of the absurdity of my unspoken thought as she seemed to imagine. I
  merely bowed, and said a little formally: 'Please don't jump to conclusions.
  May I ask why you wish me to come to a house in Kensington with you?'</p>

  <p>"The colour ebbed away from her cheeks, and she sat down again.</p>

  <p>"'That's the very thing I don't want to tell you, until you come,' she
  answered very low. 'I know it sounds absurd &mdash; it must do, it seems as
  if I were being unnecessarily mysterious. But I can't tell you, Mr Trayne, I
  can't tell you... Not yet...'</p>

  <p>"And then the call boy knocked, and I had to go on for the last act. In a
  way I suppose it was absurd of me &mdash; but life is made up of impulses. I
  confess that the whole thing intrigued me. When a woman comes and tells you
  that she has seen your play every night since it started; that she'd had to
  go without her lunch to do so; that it was a necessary part of some wonderful
  plan, and that she wants you to go to a house in Kensington, the least
  curious man would be attracted. And from my earliest infancy I've always been
  engrossed in other people's business...</p>

  <p>"'All right,' I said briefly. 'I'll come with you.'</p>

  <p>"And then I had to put out my hand to steady her, I thought she was going
  to faint. Reaction, I thought at the time; later, it struck me that the
  reason was much more prosaic &mdash; lack of food.</p>

  <p>"I stopped for a moment till she seemed herself again; then I told her to
  wait outside.</p>

  <p>"'I shall be about half an hour,' I said, 'and then we'll take a taxi, and
  go down to Kensington. Tell them to give you a chair...'</p>

  <p>"And my last impression as I went on to the stage was of a white-faced
  girl clutching the table, staring at me with great brown eyes that held in
  them a dawning triumph.</p>

  <p>"I think," went on the Actor thoughtfully, that that is where the tragedy
  of it all really lay. Afterwards she told me that the part of her plan which
  had seemed most difficult to her was getting my consent to go with her to
  Kensington. Once that was done, she knew all would be well, she was
  absolutely and supremely confident. And when I went on to the stage for the
  fourth act, she felt that success had crowned her efforts, that what was to
  come after was nothing compared to that which she had already done. The
  inaccessible stronghold had been stormed, the ogre had proved to be a
  lamb.</p>

  <p>"Well, we went to Kensington. I sent my own car home, and we took a taxi.
  During the drive she was very silent, and I didn't try to make her talk.
  Evidently no inkling of the mysterious plan was to be revealed until we
  arrived at the address she had given the driver. It was some obscure street
  that I had never heard of and the name of which I have completely forgotten.
  I know it was somewhere not far from Barker's.</p>

  <p>"The door was opened by a repulsive-looking woman who peered at me
  suspiciously. And then the girl took her on one side and whispered something
  in her ear. Apparently it had the desired effect, as the Gorgon retired
  grumbling to an odoriferous basement, leaving us alone in the hall.</p>

  <p>"When she had shut the door the girl turned to me.</p>

  <p>"'Will you come upstairs, Mr Trayne. I want you to meet my husband.'</p>

  <p>"I bowed. 'Certainly,' I said, and she led the way.</p>

  <p>"'So the husband was in the plan,' I reflected as I followed her. Was he a
  genius with a play that he proposed to read to me? I had suffered from the
  plays of genius before. Or was he some actor down on his luck? If so, why all
  the mystery? And then, when I'd made up my mind that it was a mere begging
  case, we arrived at the room. Just before she turned the handle of the door
  she again looked at me.</p>

  <p>"'My husband is ill, Mr Trayne. You'll excuse his being in bed.'</p>

  <p>"Then we went in. Good Lord! you fellows," the Actor leant forward in his
  chair. "I've been pretty hard up in the old days, but as I stood inside that
  door I realised for the first time what poverty &mdash; real poverty &mdash;
  meant. Mark you, the girl was a lady; the weak, cadaverous-looking fellow
  propped up in bed with a tattered shawl round his shoulders was a gentleman.
  And beyond the bed, and one chair, and a rackety old chest of drawers there
  wasn't a stick of furniture in the room. There was a curtain in the corner
  with what looked like a washstand behind it, and a shelf by the bed with two
  cups and some plates on it. And nothing else except an appalling oleograph of
  Queen Victoria on the wall.</p>

  <p>"'This is Mr Trayne, dear.' She was bending over her husband, and after a
  moment he looked up at me.</p>

  <p>"'It was good of you to come, sir,' he said. 'Very good.' And then he
  turned to his wife and I heard him say: 'Have you told him yet, Kitty?'</p>

  <p>"She shook her head. 'Not yet, darling, I will now.' She left his side and
  came over to me.</p>

  <p>"'Mr Trayne, I know you thought me very peculiar at the theatre. But I was
  afraid that if I told you what I really wanted you'd have refused to come.
  You get hundreds and hundreds of people coming to see you who think they can
  act. Asking you to help them get a job and that sort of thing. Well, I was
  afraid that if I told you that that was what I wanted, you'd have told me to
  go away. Perhaps you'd have given me a straw of comfort &mdash; taken my
  address &mdash; said you'd let me know if anything turned up. But nothing
  would have turned up... And, you see, I was rather desperate.'</p>

  <p>"The big brown eyes were fixed on me pleadingly, and somehow I didn't feel
  quite as annoyed as I should have done at what was nothing more nor less than
  a blatant trick to appeal to my sympathy.</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps nothing would have turned up,' I said gently, 'but you must
  remember that today the stage is a hopelessly overstocked profession. There
  are hundreds of trained actors and actresses unable to obtain a job.'</p>

  <p>"'I know that,' she cried eagerly, 'and that's why I &mdash; why I thought
  out this plan. I thought that if I could <i>really</i> convince you that I
  could act above the average...'</p>

  <p>"'And she can, Mr Trayne,' broke in her husband. 'She's good, I know
  it.'</p>

  <p>"'We must leave Mr Trayne to be the judge of that, Harry,' she smiled.
  'You see,' she went on to me, 'what I felt was that there is an opening for
  real talent. There is, isn't there?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I agreed slowly. 'There is an opening for <i>real</i> talent. But
  even that is a small one... Have you ever acted before?'</p>

  <p>"'A little. In amateur theatricals!'</p>

  <p>"I turned away. Amateur theatricals! More heart-burning and disappointment
  has been caused by those abominable entertain-ments than their misguided
  originators will ever realise.</p>

  <p>"'But don't think I'm relying on that.' The girl was speaking again, and I
  almost laughed. 'I want you to judge me tonight.'</p>

  <p>"I swung round and looked at her. So this was the mysterious plan: I was
  to witness an impromptu performance, which was to convince me that the second
  Sarah Bernhardt had been discovered.</p>

  <p>"'I couldn't have shown you, you see, in your dressing room. I shouldn't
  have had time. That's why I asked you to come here.'</p>

  <p>"'You have the courage of your convictions anyway,' I said quietly. 'I am
  perfectly ready to be convinced.'</p>

  <p>"'Then will you sit there.' She took off her hat and coat as I sat down on
  the only available chair, and from underneath his pillow the man produced a
  paper-covered book.</p>

  <p>"'You'll forgive me if I read my lines, Mr Trayne,' he said. 'I find I
  can't learn them &mdash; I can't concentrate.' He passed a thin, emaciated
  hand over his forehead. 'And it's her you want to see.'</p>

  <p>"He turned over the pages weakly; then he began to read. And I &mdash; I
  sat up as if I'd been stung. At last everything was clear: the continual
  visits to the theatre &mdash; everything. The part of all others which they
  had selected to prove her ability, was the love scene between Molly Travers
  and myself in the third act of <i>John Pendlesham's Wife</i>..."</p>

  <p>For a while there was silence, while the Actor thoughtfully lit another
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"This unknown child," he went on after a moment, "who had acted a little
  in amateur theatricals, had deliberately challenged London's greatest
  emotional actress in her most marvellous success before, Heaven help us,
  <i>me</i> &mdash; of all people. I suppose if I was writing a story I should
  say that she triumphed; that as I sat in that bare and hideous room I
  realised that before me was genius &mdash; a second and greater Molly; that
  from that moment her foot was set on the ladder of fame, and there was no
  looking back."</p>

  <p>The Actor laughed a little sadly. "Unfortunately, I'm not writing a story,
  I'm telling the truth. I don't know how I sat through the next twenty
  minutes. It was the most ghastly caricature of Molly that I have ever thought
  of; the more ghastly because it was so intensely unintentional. Every little
  gesture was faithfully copied; every little trick and mannerism had been
  carefully learnt by heart. And this, as I say, to me who acted with that
  divine genius every night. God! it was awful. That marvellous line of
  Molly's, when, standing in the centre of the stage facing me across the
  table, she said: 'Then you don't want me back?' that line which was made
  marvellous merely through the consummate restraint with which she said it,
  sounded from this poor child like a parlourmaid giving notice.</p>

  <p>"And then, at last it was over, and I realised I had to say something.
  They were both staring at me, hope shining clear in the girl's eyes and pride
  in the man's.</p>

  <p>"'She's great, isn't she, Mr Trayne?' he said. 'I've not had the privilege
  of seeing you and Miss Travers in the part &mdash; but I feel that now
  &mdash; why,' he gave a little shaky laugh, 'that it's hardly necessary.'</p>

  <p>"You see," said the Actor slowly, "that was the devil of it all. They were
  both so utterly certain, especially the man. The difficulty had been to get
  me there; after that it had been easy. I glanced at the poor fellow in the
  bed, and his thoughts were plain to read. No more grinding poverty, no more
  unfurnished bed-sitting rooms, and &mdash; fame for the woman he loved! And
  then he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"'I'm such a hopeless crock, Mr Trayne, and she' &mdash; he took one of
  her hands in both his own &mdash; 'she's had to do all the work. Beastly,
  grinding work in an office, when she was capable of this.'</p>

  <p>"The girl bent over him, and I looked away. It seemed to me that the
  ground on which I stood was holy."</p>

  <p>The Actor gave a short laugh which deceived no one. "I suppose I was an
  ass," he went on, "but I'd do it again today. 'It was wonderful,' I said,
  'quite wonderful.' And because I'm an actor they believed me. Not that he, at
  any rate, required much convincing &mdash; he only wanted his knowledge
  confirmed. Of course, when I spoke I didn't realise what I was letting myself
  in for. I should have done, I suppose, but &mdash; I wasn't left long in
  doubt. If she was wonderful &mdash; and had not I, Herbert Trayne, said so
  &mdash; what about a job? At once... With my backing it was easy... Which was
  all quite true except for the one vital fact of my having lied. But, hang it,
  you fellows!" he exploded, "could you have told 'em it was the most appalling
  exhibition of utter futility you'd ever witnessed?"</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't," said the Soldier. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"I can see them now," continued the Actor. "He was holding her hand, and
  looking up into her face &mdash; as a dog looks at the being it adores. And
  she was smiling a little, and crying a little &mdash; tears of pure joy. The
  strain was over, the lunches had not been missed in vain. And I stood there
  like a dumb idiot racking my brains for something to say. They thought I was
  wondering what job to offer her; they were right, I was." The Actor laughed
  shortly.</p>

  <p>"But I'd gone into the morass, and there was nothing for it but to blunder
  in deeper. The one vital essential was that in no circumstances must the poor
  child ever be allowed to act. The other was money &mdash; and at once. So I
  offered her then and there a job as Molly Travers' understudy at five pounds
  a week."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" The Doctor sat up with a jerk. "Understudy Molly?"</p>

  <p>"I explained, of course," went on the Actor, "that there was an understudy
  already, and that to save unpleasantness it would be better if she didn't
  come to the theatre, unless I sent for her. That, of course, it was more than
  likely that Miss Travers wouldn't be ill during the run of the play, and that
  in those circumstances I didn't want to offend the present understudy. And
  when another play came along, we must see what we could do. That, thank
  Heaven, I knew was some way off yet! It gave me breathing space.</p>

  <p>"I gave her a week's salary in advance, and I got away &mdash; somehow. I
  think they were both a little dazed with the wonder of it, and they wanted to
  be alone. I heard his voice &mdash; weak and quavering &mdash; as I shut the
  door.</p>

  <p>"'Oh! my very dear girl,' he was whispering &mdash; and she was on her
  knees beside the bed. And I blundered my way downstairs, cursing myself for a
  sentimental fool. There's whisky on the table, you fellows, Help
  yourselves."</p>

  <p>But no one moved, and the Actor lit another cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I saw her occasionally during the next two or three months," he
  continued, "though I never went to their rooms again. They had moved &mdash;
  I knew that &mdash; because I used to post the cheque every week. But the few
  times I did see her, I gathered that her husband was not getting any better.
  And one day I insisted on Lawrence, the specialist, going to see him. I
  couldn't have one of my company being worried, I told her, over things of
  that sort. I can see her face now as I said 'one of my company'. I don't know
  what Lawrence said to her, but he rang me up at the theatre that night, and
  he did not mince his words to me.</p>

  <p>"'I give him a month,' he said. 'It's galloping consumption.'</p>

  <p>"It was just about a month later that the thing happened which I had been
  dreading. Molly went down with flu. Her understudy &mdash; the real one
  &mdash; was Violet Dorman, who was unknown then. And, of course it was her
  chance."</p>

  <p>"One moment," interrupted the Barrister. "Did anyone at the theatre know
  about this girl?"</p>

  <p>"Good God! no," cried the Actor. "Not a soul. In this censorious world
  actions such as mine in that case are apt to be misconstrued, which alone was
  sufficient to make me keep it dark. No one knew.</p>

  <p>"The first night &mdash; all was well. Molly went down in the afternoon,
  and it didn't come out in any of the evening papers. Violet acted
  magnificently. She wasn't Molly, of course &mdash; she isn't now. But it was
  her chance, and she took it &mdash; and took it well. Next morning the
  papers, naturally, had it in. 'Temporary indisposition of Miss Molly Travers.
  Part filled at a moment's notice with great credit by Miss Violet Dorman.'
  She had a press agent and he boomed her for all he was worth. And I read the
  papers and cursed. Not that I grudged her her success in the slightest, but I
  was thinking of the afternoon. It was matinée day and the girl must read it
  in the papers.</p>

  <p>"There was only one thing for it &mdash; to go round and see her. Whatever
  happened I had to prevent her coming to the theatre. How I was going to do it
  without giving the show away I hadn't an idea, but somehow or other it had
  got to be done. My blundering foolishness &mdash; even though it had been for
  the best &mdash; had caused the trouble; it was up to me to try and right it.
  So I went round and found her with a doctor in the sitting room. He was just
  going as I came in, and his face was grave.</p>

  <p>"'Harry's dying,' she said to me quite simply, and I glanced at the
  doctor, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"Poor child! I crossed over to her side, and though it seems an awful
  thing to say, my only feeling was one of relief. After what Lawrence had said
  I knew it was hopeless, and since the poor devil had to go he couldn't have
  chosen a more opportune moment from my point of view. It solved the
  difficulty. If he was dying she couldn't come to the theatre, and by the time
  the funeral was over Molly would be back. I didn't realise that one doesn't
  get out of things quite as easily as that.</p>

  <p>"'I've only just realised how bad he was,' she went on in a flat, dead
  voice.</p>

  <p>"'Does he know,' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'No. He thinks he's going to get better. Why didn't you send for me last
  night, Mr Trayne?'</p>

  <p>"It was so unexpected, that I hesitated and stammered.</p>

  <p>"'I couldn't get at you in time,' I said finally. 'Miss Travers only
  became ill late in the afternoon.'</p>

  <p>"With a strange look on her face she opened a paper &mdash; some cursed
  rag I hadn't seen.</p>

  <p>"'It says here,' she went on slowly, 'that she was confined to her bed all
  yesterday. Oh! it doesn't matter much, does it?' She put the paper down
  wearily, and gave the most heart rending little sobbing laugh I've ever
  heard.</p>

  <p>"'What do you mean?' I stammered out.</p>

  <p>"'I suppose you did it for the best, Mr Trayne. I suppose I ought to be
  grateful. But you lied that night &mdash; didn't you?'</p>

  <p>"I was fingering a book on the table and for the life of me I couldn't
  think of anything to say. 'He doesn't know,' she went on. 'He still thinks
  I'm a God-sent genius. And he mustn't know.'</p>

  <p>"'Why should he?' I said. And then I put my hand on her arm. 'Tell me, how
  did you find out?'</p>

  <p>"'You admit it then?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I said quietly, 'I admit that I lied. I was so desperately sorry
  for you.'</p>

  <p>"'I mentioned it to someone &mdash; a man who knew the stage &mdash; about
  a week ago. He looked at me in blank amazement, and then he laughed. I
  suppose he couldn't help it: it was so ridiculous. I was furious &mdash;
  furious. But afterwards I began to think, and I asked other people one or two
  questions &mdash; and then that came,' she pointed to the paper, 'and I knew.
  And now &mdash; oh! thank God &mdash; he's dying. He mustn't know, Mr Trayne,
  he mustn't.'</p>

  <p>"And at that moment he came into the room &mdash; tottered in is a better
  word.</p>

  <p>"'Boy,' she cried in an agony, 'what are you doing?'</p>

  <p>"'I thought I heard Mr Trayne's voice,' he whispered, collapsing in the
  chair. 'I'm much better today, much. Bit weak still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>" And then he saw the paper, and he leant forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>"'Ill,' he cried. 'Molly Travers ill. Why, my dear &mdash; but it's your
  chance.' He read on a bit, and she looked at me desperately. 'But why weren't
  you there last night? Who is this woman, Violet Dorman?'</p>

  <p>"'You see, Tracy,' I said, picking up the paper and putting it out of his
  reach, 'it was so sudden, Miss Travers' illness, that I couldn't get at your
  wife in time.'</p>

  <p>"'Quite,' he whispered. 'Of course. But there's a matinée this afternoon,
  isn't there? Oh! I wonder if I'm well enough to go. I'm so much better
  today.' And then he looked at his wife. 'My dear! my dear &mdash; at
  last!'</p>

  <p>"I don't think I've ever seen such pathetic pride and love shining in a
  man's face before or since.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid you won't be quite well enough to go,' I muttered.</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps it would be wiser not to,' he whispered. 'But to think I shall
  miss her first appearance. Have you come to fetch her now, Mr Trayne?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, darling,' the girl replied, and her voice sounded as steady as a
  rock. 'Mr Trayne has come to fetch me. But it's early yet and I want you to
  go back to bed now...'</p>

  <p>"Without a glance at me she helped him from the room and left me standing
  there. I heard their voices &mdash; hers clear and strong, his barely
  audible. And not for the first time in my life I marvelled at the wonder of a
  woman who loves. I was to marvel more in a moment or two.</p>

  <p>"She came back and shut the door. Then she stood facing me.</p>

  <p>"'There's only one way, Mr Trayne, though I think it's going to break my
  heart. I must go to the theatre.</p>

  <p>"'But &mdash; your husband...' I stammered.</p>

  <p>"'Oh! I'm not really going. I shall be here &mdash; at hand &mdash; the
  whole time. Because if the end did come &mdash; why then &mdash; I
  <i>must</i> be with him. But he's got to think I've gone; I've got to hide
  from him until after the matinée is over. And then I must tell him' &mdash;
  she faltered a little &mdash; 'of my success. I'll keep the papers from him
  &mdash; if it's necessary...' She turned away and I heard her falter: 'Three
  hours away from him &mdash; when he's dying. Oh, my God!'</p>

  <p>The Actor paused, and the Soldier stirred restlessly in his chair. "I left
  shortly after," he went on at length, "I saw she wanted me to.</p>

  <p>"All through the play that afternoon it haunted me &mdash; the pathos of
  it &mdash; aye, the horror of it. I pictured that girl hiding somewhere,
  while in the room above the sands were running out. Longing with all the
  power of her being to go to him &mdash; to snatch every fleeting minute with
  him &mdash; and yet condemned by my stupidity to forfeit her right. And then
  at last the show was over, and I went to her room again.</p>

  <p>"She was by his side, kneeling on the floor, as I came in. As he saw me he
  struggled up on his elbow, and one could see it was the end.</p>

  <p>"'Dear fellow,' I said, 'she was wonderful &mdash; just wonderful!'</p>

  <p>"And the girl looked up at me through her blinding tears.</p>

  <p>"'Just wonderful,' I said again. Five minutes later he died..."</p>

  <p>The Actor fell silent.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see her again?" asked the Soldier thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Never: she disappeared. Just a patch on the quilt as I said. But there
  was one thread missing. Three years later I received a registered envelope.
  There was no letter inside, no word of any sort. Just these." He fumbled in
  his pocket. "There are twenty of them."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand, and the Soldier leaning forward saw that it
  contained a little bundle of five-pound notes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">II.</a> &mdash; THE BARRISTER'S STORY,<br>
  BEING THE DECISION OF SIR EDWARD SHOREHAM</h2>

  <p class="first">"This morning," he began, leaning back in his chair and
crossing his legs,
  "I mislaid my cigarette case. I knew it was somewhere in the study, but find
  it I could not. Finally, having searched all over my writing table, I rang
  the bell, and somewhat irritably demanded its immediate production. The
  butler stepped forward and lifted it up from the centre of the blotting pad,
  where it had been the whole time, literally under my nose. What peculiar
  temporary kink in the brain had prevented my noticing the very thing I was
  looking for, when it was lying in the most conspicuous place in which it
  could possibly have been, I don't know. I leave that to the Doctor. But the
  point of my parable is this &mdash; it decided in my mind the story with
  which I should bore you fellows tonight."</p>

  <p>He paused to light a cigar, then he glanced round at the faces of the
  other five.</p>

  <p>"And if, as I get on with it, you think you recognise the real characters
  under the fictional names I shall give them, I can't prevent you. But don't
  ask me to confirm your thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," murmured the Actor. "Fire ahead."</p>

  <p>"It was about four years before the war," commenced the Barrister, "that I
  was stopping for a few nights at a certain house in Park Lane. It was in the
  middle of the season &mdash; June, to be accurate &mdash; and I was waiting
  to get in here. My wife was in the country, and, as I was more or less at a
  loose end, I accepted the offer of staying at this house. My hostess &mdash;
  shall we call her Granger, Ruth Granger &mdash; had been an old school pal of
  my wife's; in later years she had become a real, intimate friend of us
  both.</p>

  <p>"At the time of which I speak she was a lovely girl of twenty-six, with
  the suffering of six years of hell in her eyes. At the age of twenty she had
  married Sir Henry Granger, and that fatal mistake had been the cause of the
  hell. Henry Granger was one of the most loathsome brutes it has ever been my
  misfortune to run across. He had not one single instinct of a gentleman in
  him, though he did happen to be the tenth baronet. How her parents had ever
  allowed the marriage beat me completely. Perhaps it was money, for Granger
  was rich; but whatever it was she married him, and her hell began.</p>

  <p>"Granger was simply an animal, a coarse and vicious animal. He drank
  heavily without getting drunk, which is always a dangerous sign, and he
  possessed the morals &mdash; or did not possess the morals, whichever you
  prefer &mdash; of a monkey. He was unfaithful to her on their honeymoon
  &mdash; my wife told me that; and from then on he made not the slightest
  attempt to conceal his mode of life."</p>

  <p>The Barrister carefully removed the ash from his cigar. "I won't labour
  the point," he went on with a faint smile. "We have all of us met the type,
  but I'd like to emphasise the fact that I, at any rate, have never met any
  member of that type who came within a mile of him. Most of 'em have some
  semblance of decency about 'em &mdash; make some attempt to conceal their
  affairs. Granger didn't; he seemed to prefer that they should be known.
  Sometimes since then I have wondered whether he was actuated by a sort of
  blind rage &mdash; by a mad desire to pierce through the calm, icy contempt
  of his wife; to make her writhe and suffer, because he realised she was so
  immeasurably his superior." He paused thoughtfully. "He made her suffer right
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Did she never try for a divorce?" asked the Soldier</p>

  <p>"No, never. We discussed it once &mdash; she, and my wife and I; and I had
  to explain to her our peculiar laws on the subject. His adultery by itself
  was, of course, not sufficient, and for some reason she flatly refused to
  consider a mere separation. She wouldn't face the scandal and publicity for
  only that. I said to her then: 'Why not apply for a restitution of conjugal
  rights. Get your husband to leave the house, and if he doesn't return in
  fourteen days &mdash;'</p>

  <p>"She stopped me with a bitter laugh.</p>

  <p>"'It seems rather fatuous,' she said slowly, 'getting a lawyer to ask my
  husband to do what he is only too ready to do &mdash; return to me.'</p>

  <p>"'But surely,' I began, not quite taking her meaning.</p>

  <p>"'You see, Bill,' she answered in a flat, dead voice, 'my husband is very
  fond of me &mdash; as a stopgap. After most of his episodes he honours me
  with his attentions for two or three days.'</p>

  <p>"That was the devil of it &mdash; he didn't intend to let her divorce him.
  She formed an excellent hostess for his house, and for the rest there were
  always <i>les autres</i>. And he wanted her, too, because he couldn't get
  her, and that made him mad."</p>

  <p>The Barrister leant forward, and the firelight flickered on his thin,
  ascetic face.</p>

  <p>"Such was the state of affairs when I went to stay. The particular lady at
  the time who was being honoured by Henry Granger was a shining light in
  musical comedy &mdash; Nelly Jones, shall we call her? It is very far from
  her real name. If possible, he had been more open over this affair than
  usual; everyone who knew the Grangers in London knew about it &mdash;
  <i>everyone</i>. He had twice dined with her at the same restaurant at which
  his wife was entertaining, once deliberately selecting the next table."</p>

  <p>"What an unmitigated swine!" cried the Ordinary Man.</p>

  <p>"He was," agreed the Barrister briefly. "But even that was not sufficient
  to satisfy the gentleman. He proceeded to do a thing which put him for ever
  outside the pale. He brought this girl to a reception of his wife's at his
  own house.</p>

  <p>"It was the night that I arrived. She had fixed up one of those ghastly
  entertainments which are now, thank Heaven, practically extinct. Somebody
  sings and nobody listens, and you meet everybody you particularly want to
  avoid. Mercifully I ran into an old pal, also of your calling, Actor-man
  &mdash; Violet Seymour. No reason why I should disguise her name at any rate.
  She was not acting at the moment, and we sat in a sort of alcove place at the
  top of the stairs, on the same landing as the reception room.</p>

  <p>"'There's going to be a break here soon, Bill,' she said to me after a
  while. 'Ruth is going to snap.'</p>

  <p>"'Poor girl!' I answered. 'But what the devil can one do, Violet?'</p>

  <p>"'Nothing,' she said fiercely, 'except alter your abominably unjust laws.
  Why can't she get a divorce, Bill? It's vile &mdash; utterly vile.'</p>

  <p>"And then &mdash; well, let's call him Sir Edward Shoreham, joined us. He
  was on the Bench &mdash; a judge, which makes the disguise of a false name
  pretty thin, especially in view of what is to come. I remember he had
  recently taken a murder case &mdash; one that had aroused a good deal of
  popular attention &mdash; and the prisoner had been found guilty. We were
  talking about it at the time Sir Edward arrived, with Violet, as usual,
  tilting lances against every form of authority.</p>

  <p>"I can see her now as she turned to Sir Edward with a sort of dreadful
  fascination on her face.</p>

  <p>"'And so you sentenced him to death?'</p>

  <p>"He nodded gravely. 'Certainly,' he answered. 'He was guilty.'</p>

  <p>"And then she turned half away, speaking almost under her breath.</p>

  <p>"'And doesn't it ever appal you? Make you wake in the middle of the night,
  with your mouth dry and your throat parched. All this &mdash; life, love
  &mdash; and in a cell, a man waiting &mdash; a man you've sent there. Ticking
  off the days on his nerveless fingers &mdash; staring out at the sun. My God!
  it would drive me mad.'</p>

  <p>"Ned Shoreham smiled a little grimly.</p>

  <p>"'You seem to forget one unimportant factor,' he answered; 'the wretched
  woman that man killed.'</p>

  <p>"'No, I don't,' she cried. 'But the punishment is so immeasur-ably worse
  than the crime. I don't think death would matter if it came suddenly; but to
  sit waiting with a sort of sickening helplessness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was then Ruth Granger joined us. Some woman was singing in the
  reception room and, for the moment, she was free from her duties as
  hostess.</p>

  <p>"'You seem very serious,' she said with her grave, sweet smile, holding
  out her hand to Sir Edward.</p>

  <p>"'Miss Seymour is a revolutionary,' he answered lightly, and I happened at
  that moment to glance at Ruth. And for the moment she had let the mask slip
  as she looked at Ned Shoreham's face. Then it was replaced, but their secret
  was out, as far as I was concerned, though on matters of affection I am the
  least observant of mortals. If they weren't in love with one another, they
  were as near to it as made no odds. And it gave me a bit of a shock.</p>

  <p>"Shoreham was young &mdash; young, at any rate, for the Bench &mdash; and
  he was unmarried. And somehow I couldn't fit Shoreham into the situation of
  loving another man's wife. There had never been a breath of scandal that I
  had heard; if there had been, it would have finished him for good. A judge
  must be like Caesar's wife. And Shoreham, even then, had established a
  reputation for the most scrupulous observance of the law. His enemies called
  him cruel and harsh; those who knew him better realised that his apparent
  harshness was merely a cloak he had wrapped tightly round himself as a guard
  against a naturally tender heart. I don't know any man that I can think of
  who had such an undeviating idea of duty as Shoreham, and without being in
  the least a prig, such an exalted idea of the responsibilities of his
  position. And to realise suddenly that he was in love with Ruth Granger, as I
  say, came as a shock.</p>

  <p>"'What was the argument about?' she said, sitting down beside me.</p>

  <p>"'Morality <i>versus</i> the Law,' chipped in Violet.</p>

  <p>"'The individual <i>versus</i> the community,' amended Sir Edward.
  'Justice &mdash; real justice &mdash; against sickly sentimentality, with all
  due deference to you, Miss Seymour. There are hard cases, one knows, but hard
  cases make bad laws. There's been far too much lately of men taking matters
  into their own hands &mdash; this so-called Unwritten Law. And it has got to
  stop.'</p>

  <p>"'You would never admit the justification,' said Ruth slowly.</p>

  <p>"'Never &mdash; in any circumstances,' he answered. 'You have the law
  &mdash; then appeal to the law. Otherwise there occurs chaos.'</p>

  <p>"'And what of the cases where the law gives no redress?' demanded Violet,
  and even as she spoke Granger came up the stairs with this girl on his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Ruth Granger rose, deathly white, and gazed speechlessly at her husband's
  coarse, sneering face. I don't think for a moment she fully grasped the
  immensity of the insult; she was stunned. The footmen were staring open-
  mouthed; guests passing into the supper room stopped and smirked. And then it
  was over; the tension snapped.</p>

  <p>"'Have you had any supper, Sir Edward?' said Ruth calmly, and with her
  hand on his arm she swept past her husband, completely ignoring both him and
  the girl, who flushed angrily.</p>

  <p>"'I suppose,' said Violet Seymour to me, as Granger and the girl went into
  the reception room, 'that had Ruth shot that filthy blackguard dead on the
  stairs, Sir Edward would have piously folded his hands and, in due course,
  sentenced her to death.'</p>

  <p>"And at the moment I certainly sympathised with her point of view."</p>

  <p>The Barrister got up and splashed some soda water into a glass. Then he
  continued: "I won't weary you with an account of the rest of the reception.
  You can imagine for yourselves the covert sneers and whisperings. I want to
  go on two or three hours to the time when the guests had gone, and a
  white-faced, tight-lipped woman was staring at the dying embers of a fire in
  her sitting room, while I stood by the mantelpiece wondering what the devil
  to do to help. Granger was in his study, where he had retired on the
  departure of Miss Jones, and I, personally, had seen two bottles of champagne
  taken to him there by one of the footmen.</p>

  <p>"'It's the end, Bill,' she said, looking at me suddenly, 'absolutely the
  end. I can't go on &mdash; not after tonight. How dared he bring that woman
  here? How dared he?'</p>

  <p>"Violet had been right &mdash; the break had come. Ruth Granger was
  desperate, and there was an expression on her face that it wasn't good to
  see. It put the wind up me all right.</p>

  <p>"'Go to bed, Ruth,' I said quietly. 'There's no good having a row with
  Granger tonight; you can say what you want to say tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>"And at that moment the door opened and her husband came in. As I said, he
  was a man who never got drunk, but that night he was unsteady on his legs. He
  stood by the door, swaying a little and staring at her with a sneer on his
  face. He was a swine sober; in drink he was &mdash; well, words fail. But, by
  God! you fellows, she got through him and into him until I thought he was
  going to strike her. I believe that was what she was playing for at the time,
  because I was there as a witness. But he didn't, and when she finished
  flaying him he merely laughed in her face.</p>

  <p>"'And what about your own damned lover, my virtuous darling?' he sneered.
  'What about the upright judge whom you adore &mdash; dear, kind Edward
  Shoreham?'</p>

  <p>"It was unexpected; she didn't know he had guessed &mdash; and her face
  gave her away for a moment. Then she straightened up proudly.</p>

  <p>"'Sir Edward Shoreham and I are on terms which an animal of your gross
  mind couldn't possibly understand,' she answered coldly, and he laughed. 'If
  you insinuate that he is my lover in the accepted sense of the word, you lie
  and you know it.'</p>

  <p>"Without another word she walked contemptuously by him, and the door
  closed behind her. And after a moment or two I followed her, leaving him
  staring moodily at the empty grate. I couldn't have spoken to him without
  being rude and, after all, I was under his roof."</p>

  <p>The Barrister leant back in his chair and crossed his legs.</p>

  <p>"Now that was the situation," he continued, "when I went to bed. My room
  was almost opposite Lady Granger's, and at the end of the passage, which was
  a cul-de-sac, was the door leading into Granger's study. I hadn't started to
  undress when I heard him come past my room and go along the passage to his
  study. And I was still thinking over the situation about ten minutes later
  when Lady Granger's door opened. I knew it was hers because I heard her speak
  to her maid, telling her to go to bed. The girl said 'Goodnight,' and
  something &mdash; I don't quite know what &mdash; made me look through the
  keyhole of my door. I was feeling uneasy and alarmed; I suppose the scene
  downstairs had unsettled me. And sure enough, as soon as the maid's footsteps
  had died away, I saw through my spyhole Ruth Granger go down the passage
  towards her husband's study. For a moment I hesitated; an outsider's position
  is always awkward between husband and wife. But one thing was very certain,
  those two were in no condition to have another &mdash; and this time a
  private &mdash; interview. I opened my door noiselessly and peered out. It
  struck me that if I heard things getting too heated I should have to
  intervene. She was just opening the door of his study as I looked along the
  passage, and then in a flash the whole thing seemed to happen. The door shut
  behind her; there was a pause of one &mdash; perhaps two seconds &mdash; and
  a revolver shot rang out, followed by the sound of a heavy fall. For a moment
  I was stunned; then I raced along the passage as hard as I could, and flung
  open the door of the study.</p>

  <p>"On the floor lay Henry Granger, doubled up and sprawling, while in the
  middle of the room stood his wife staring at him speechlessly. At her feet on
  the carpet was a revolver, an automatic Colt. I stood there by the door
  staring foolishly, and after a while she spoke.</p>

  <p>"'There's been an accident,' she whispered. 'Is he dead?'</p>

  <p>"I went up to the body and turned it over. Through the shirt front was a
  small hole; underneath the left shoulder blade was another. Henry Granger had
  been shot through the heart from point-blank range; death must have been
  absolutely instan-taneous.</p>

  <p>"'My God, Ruth!' I muttered. 'How did it happen?'</p>

  <p>"'Happen?' she answered vaguely. 'There was a man...the window.'</p>

  <p>"And then she fainted. The butler, with a couple of footmen, by this time
  had appeared at the door, and I pulled myself together.</p>

  <p>"'Her ladyship's maid at once,' I said. 'Sir Henry has been shot. Ring up
  a doctor, and ask him to come round immediately.'</p>

  <p>"The butler rushed off, but I kept the two footmen.</p>

  <p>"'Wait a moment,' I cried, picking up the revolver. 'A man did it. Pull
  back the two curtains by the window, and I'll cover him.'</p>

  <p>"They did as I told them, pulled back the two heavy black curtains that
  were in front of the window. It was set back in a sort of alcove, and I had
  the revolver ready pointed to cover the murderer. I covered empty air; there
  was no one there. Then I walked over to the window and looked out. It was
  wide open, and there was a sheer drop of forty feet to the deserted area
  below. I looked upwards &mdash; I looked sideways: plain brickwork without
  footing for a cat."</p>

  <p>"'Go down to the room below,' I cried; 'he may have got in there.'</p>

  <p>"They rushed away to come back and tell me that not only were the windows
  bolted, but that they were shuttered as well. And I thought they looked at me
  curiously."</p>

  <p>He paused to relight his cigar; then he continued thoughtfully: "I don't
  quite know when I first began to feel suspicious about this mysterious man.
  The thing had been so sudden that for a while my brain refused to work; then
  gradually my legal training reasserted itself, and I started to piece things
  together. Ruth had come to again, and I put one or two questions to her. She
  was still very dazed, but she answered them quite coherently: "A man in
  evening clothes &mdash; at least, she thought he had on evening clothes
  &mdash; had been in the room as she came in. She heard a shot; the light went
  out and the window was thrown up. And then she had turned on the light just
  before I came in to see her husband lying dead on the floor. She knew no
  more. I suppose I must have looked a bit thoughtful, for she suddenly got up
  from her chair and came up to me.</p>

  <p>"'You believe me, Bill, don't you?' she said, staring at me.</p>

  <p>"'Of course, of course,' I answered hurriedly. 'Go and lie down now, Ruth,
  because we shall have to send for the police.'</p>

  <p>"Without another word she left the room with her maid, and, after telling
  the footmen to wait downstairs till they were wanted, I sat down to think.
  Now, this isn't a detective story; such as it is, it concerns a more
  interesting study than the mere detection of crime. It concerns the struggle
  in the soul of an upright man between love and duty. And the man was Sir
  Edward Shoreham.</p>

  <p>"Unknown to me she sent for him &mdash; asked him to come at once &mdash;
  and he came. He was shown by the butler into the study, where I was still
  sitting at the desk, and he stopped motionless by the door staring at the
  body, which had not been moved. I was waiting for the doctor, and I got up
  surprised.</p>

  <p>"'The butler told me he had been shot,' he said a little jerkily. 'How did
  it happen?'</p>

  <p>"'I wasn't expecting you, Sir Edward,' I answered slowly. 'But I'm glad
  that you've come. I'd like another opinion.'</p>

  <p>"'What do you mean?' he cried. 'Is there any mystery?'</p>

  <p>"'I'll tell you exactly what happened as far as I know the facts,' I said.
  'Lady Granger and her husband had a very bad quarrel tonight. Then she came
  to bed, and so did I. Shortly afterwards her husband came along into this
  room. Now, my bedroom is in the passage you have just come along, and about
  ten minutes after Sir Henry came in here, his wife followed him. I opened my
  door, because I was afraid they might start quarrelling again, and he had
  been drinking. I saw her come in; there was a pause, and then a revolver shot
  rang out.'</p>

  <p>"'Was this door shut?' he snapped.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I answered, 'it was. I rushed along the passage and came in. I
  found her standing, with the revolver at her feet, staring at her husband,
  who was lying where he is now. She said: 'There's been an accident.' And then
  she muttered something about a man and the window before she fainted. I went
  to the window, and there was no one there. I looked out; will you do the
  same?'</p>

  <p>"I waited while he walked over and looked out, and after what seemed an
  interminable time he came back again.</p>

  <p>"'How long was it after the shot before you looked out?' His voice was
  very low as he asked the question.</p>

  <p>"'Not a quarter of a minute,' I answered, and we both stood staring at one
  another in silence.</p>

  <p>"'Good God!' he said at length, 'what are you driving at?'</p>

  <p>"'I'm not driving at anything, Sir Edward,' I answered. 'At least, I'm
  trying not to drive at it. But the man is dead, and the police must be sent
  for. What are we going to say?'</p>

  <p>"'The truth, of course,' he answered instantly.</p>

  <p>"'Quite,' I said slowly. 'But what is the truth?'</p>

  <p>"He turned very white, and leant against one of the old suits of armour,
  of which the dead man had a wonderful collection all over the house.</p>

  <p>"'Did Lady Granger see this man go out of the window?' he asked at
  length.</p>

  <p>"'No, she only heard him open it. You see, she says he switched off the
  light. It was on when I rushed in.'</p>

  <p>"'A rope,' he suggested.</p>

  <p>"'Impossible in the time,' I said; 'utterly impossible. Such a suggestion
  would be laughed out of court.'</p>

  <p>"He came over and sat down heavily in a chair, and his face was
  haggard.</p>

  <p>"'Sir Edward,' I went on desperately, 'the doctor will be here shortly;
  the police must be sent for. We've got to decide something. This man didn't
  go out by the door or I'd have seen him; only a fly could have gone out by
  the window. We've got to face the facts.'</p>

  <p>"'You don't believe there was a man here at all,' he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"'Heaven help me! I don't,' I answered. 'It's all so easy to reconstruct.
  The poor girl was driven absolutely desperate by what happened tonight, and
  by the last thing he said to her after their quarrel.' I looked at him for a
  moment before going on. 'He accused her of being in love with you.' I said it
  deliberately, and he caught his breath sharply.</p>

  <p>"'Can't you see it all?' I continued. 'She came in here, and she shot him;
  and when she'd done it her nerves gave, and she said the first thing to me
  that came into her head.'</p>

  <p>"'If you're right,' he said heavily, 'it means that Ruth will be tried for
  murder!' He got up with his hands to his temples. 'My God! Stratton,' he
  cried, 'this is awful. Premeditated murder, too &mdash; not done blindly in
  the middle of a quarrel, but a quarter of an hour after it was over.'</p>

  <p>"'That's how it would strike a jury,' I answered gravely.</p>

  <p>"'Supposing she had done it suddenly, blindly' &mdash; he was talking half
  to himself &mdash; 'snatched the revolver off the table as he tried to make
  love to her, let's say.' And then he stopped and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"'Supposing that had happened, it would be better for her to say so at
  once,' I said.</p>

  <p>"'But it didn't happen,' he answered; 'it couldn't have.'</p>

  <p>"'No,' I agreed. 'It didn't happen; it couldn't have. But supposing it
  had, Sir Edward, what then?'</p>

  <p>"'Stop, Stratton,' he cried. 'For Heaven's sake, stop!'</p>

  <p>"'There's no good stopping,' I said. 'We haven't any time for argument.
  Your legal knowledge has suggested the same solution as occurred to me. If
  <i>now</i>, at once, when we send for the police, she says it was an accident
  &mdash; gives a complete story, chapter and verse&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Invents it, you mean,' he interrupted.</p>

  <p>"'Call it what you like,' I said, 'but, unless she does that and
  substantiates the story, she will be tried for the premeditated and wilful
  murder of her husband. She'll have to be tried anyway, but if she makes a
  voluntary confession &mdash; makes a story out of it that will appeal to
  sentiment &mdash; they will acquit her. It's the only chance.'</p>

  <p>"'But it's monstrous, man,' he muttered &mdash; only now his eyes were
  fixed on me questioningly.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, Sir Edward,' I said, 'let's discuss this matter calmly.
  Humanly speaking, we know what happened. Ruth came along that passage, opened
  this door, and shot her husband dead through the heart &mdash; that is the
  case as I should put it to the jury, the plain issue shorn of all its
  trappings. What is going to be the verdict?'</p>

  <p>"Shoreham plucked at his collar as if he were fighting for breath.</p>

  <p>"'If, on the other hand, the shot was not immediate &mdash; and I am the
  only witness as to that; if I had heard his voice raised in anger; if he had
  sprung at her, tried to kiss her, and she blindly, without thought, had
  snatched up the first thing that came to her hand, the revolver, not even
  knowing it was loaded &mdash; what then? The servants can be squared. She was
  talking wildly when she mentioned this man &mdash; didn't know what she was
  saying. And then, when she got back to her room she realised that the truth
  was best, and rang you up, a Judge. What better possible proof could any jury
  have of her desire to conceal nothing? And you with your reputation on the
  Bench&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Ah, don't, don't!' he cried hoarsely. 'You're driving me mad! You're
  &mdash; you're &mdash; !'</p>

  <p>"'Why, Ned, what's the matter?'</p>

  <p>"We both swung round. Ruth had come in, unnoticed by us, and was staring
  at Shoreham with wonder in her eyes. Then, with a shudder, she stepped past
  her husband's body and came into the room.</p>

  <p>"'They've just told me you were here,' she said, and then she gave a
  little cry. 'Ned, why are you looking like that? Ned! you don't think &mdash;
  you don't think I did it?'</p>

  <p>"She cowered back, looking first at him and then at me.</p>

  <p>"'You <i>can't</i> think I did it,' she whispered. 'I tell you there was a
  man here &mdash; the man who shot him. Oh! they'll believe me, won't
  they?'</p>

  <p>"'Ruth,' I said, 'I want you to realise that we're both of us your
  friends.' Which is the sort of fatuous remark one does make when the tension
  is a bit acute. She never even glanced at me as I spoke; with a sort of sick
  horror in her eyes, she was staring at Shoreham, and I blundered on: 'When
  you talked about this man you were unnerved &mdash; distraught; you didn't
  know what you were saying. We both realise that. But now we've got to think
  of the best way of &mdash; of helping you. You see, the police must be sent
  for &mdash; we ought to have sent for them sooner &mdash; and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"She walked past me and went over to Shoreham.</p>

  <p>"'Do you believe I did it, Ned?' she said quietly. 'If I swear to you that
  I didn't &mdash; would that convince you?'</p>

  <p>"'But, Ruth,' he cried desperately, 'it isn't me you've got to convince
  &mdash; it's the police. A man couldn't have got out of that window in the
  time. It's a physical impossibility. If you told it to the police, they'd
  laugh. Tell us the truth, my dear. I beseech you. Tell us the truth, and
  we'll see what can be done.'</p>

  <p>"She stood very still, with her hands clenched by her sides. And then
  quite deliberately she spoke to Shoreham.</p>

  <p>"'If you don't believe there was a man here,' she said, 'you <i>must</i>
  think I shot my husband. There was no one else who could have done it. Well
  &mdash; supposing I did. You acknowledge no justification for such an
  act?'</p>

  <p>"I started to speak, but she silenced me with an imperative wave of her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"'Please, Bill &mdash; Well, Ned &mdash; I'm waiting. If I did shoot him
  &mdash; what then?'"</p>

  <p>The Barrister paused to relight his cigar, and the others waited in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"She was staring at Shoreham," he went on after a while, "with a faint,
  half-mocking, wholly tender smile on her lips, and if either he or I had been
  less dense that smile should have made us think. But at the moment I was
  absorbed in the problem of how to save her; while she was absorbed in a very
  different one concerning the mentality of the man she cared for. And Shoreham
  &mdash; well, he was absorbed in the old, old fight between love and duty,
  and the fierceness of the struggle was showing on his face.</p>

  <p>"There in front of him stood the woman he loved, the woman who had just
  shot her husband, and the woman who was now free for him to marry. He knew as
  well as I did that in adopting the line I had suggested lay the best chance
  of getting her acquitted. He knew as well as I did that the vast majority of
  juries would acquit if the story were put to them as we had outlined it. He
  could visualise as well as I the scene in court. Counsel for the defence
  &mdash; I'd already fixed on Grayson in my mind as her counsel &mdash;
  outlining the whole scene: her late husband's abominable conduct culminating
  in this final outrage at her reception. And then as he came to the moment of
  the tragedy, I could picture him turning to the jury with passionate
  sincerity in his face &mdash; appealing to them as men &mdash; happily
  married, perhaps, but men, at any rate, to whom home life was sacred.</p>

  <p>"I could hear his voice &mdash; low and earnest &mdash; as he sketched for
  them that last scene. This poor, slighted, tormented woman &mdash; girl,
  gentlemen, for she is little more than a girl &mdash; went in desperation to
  the man &mdash; well, he is dead now, and we will leave it at that &mdash; to
  the man who had made her life a veritable hell. She pleaded with him,
  gentlemen, to allow her to divorce him &mdash; pleaded for some remnant of
  decent feelings in him. And what was his answer &mdash; what was the answer
  of this devil who was her husband? Did he meet her halfway? Did he profess
  the slightest sorrow for his despicable conduct?</p>

  <p>"No, gentlemen &mdash; not one word. His sole response was to spring at
  her in his drunken frenzy and endeavour to fix his vile attentions on her.
  And she, mad with terror and fright, snatched up the revolver which was lying
  on the desk. It might have been a ruler &mdash; anything; she was not
  responsible at the moment for what she did. Do you blame her, gentlemen? You
  have daughters of your own. She no more knew what she had in her hand than a
  baby would. To keep him away &mdash; that was her sole idea. And then &mdash;
  suddenly &mdash; it happened. The revolver went off &mdash; the man fell
  dead.</p>

  <p>"What did this girl do, gentlemen, after that? Realising that he was dead,
  did she make any attempt to conceal what she had done &mdash; to conceal her
  share in the matter? No &mdash; exactly the reverse. Instantly she rang up
  Sir Edward Shoreham, whose views on such matters are well known to you all.
  And then and there she told him everything &mdash; concealing nothing,
  excusing nothing. Sir Edward Shoreham of all people, who, with due deference
  to such a distinguished public man, has at times been regarded as &mdash;
  well &mdash; er &mdash; not lenient in his judgments. And you have heard what
  Sir Edward said in the box..."</p>

  <p>Once again the Barrister paused and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I'd got as far as that, you see, before Shoreham answered her. And he had
  got as far as that, too, I think. He saw it all, built on a foundation of
  lies &mdash; built on the foundation of his dishonour. No one would ever know
  except us three &mdash; but that doesn't make a thing easier for the Edward
  Shorehams of the world.</p>

  <p>"And then he spoke &mdash; in a low, tense voice: "'If you shot him,
  dear,' he said, 'nothing matters save getting you off.'</p>

  <p>"Some people," pursued the Barrister, "might call it a victory &mdash;
  some people would call it a defeat. Depends on one's outlook; depends on how
  much one really believes in the 'Could not love you half so much, loved I not
  honour more' idea. But certainly the murderer himself was very pleased.'</p>

  <p>"The murderer?" cried the Ordinary Man sitting up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"The murderer," returned the Barrister. "That's why I mentioned about my
  cigarette case this morning. He had been standing behind the suit of armour
  in the corner the whole time. He came out suddenly, and we all stared at him
  speechlessly, and then he started coughing &mdash; a dreadful tearing cough
  &mdash; which stained his handkerchief scarlet.</p>

  <p>"'I must apologise,' he said when he could speak, 'but there was another
  thing besides shooting Granger that I wanted to do before I died. That was
  why I didn't want to be caught tonight. However, a man must cough when he's
  got my complaint. But I'm glad I restrained myself long enough to hear your
  decision, Sir Edward. I congratulate you on it.'</p>

  <p>"'You scoundrel!' began Shoreham, starting forward, 'why didn't you
  declare yourself sooner?'</p>

  <p>"'Because there's another thing I wanted to do,' he repeated wearily. 'In
  Paris, in the Rue St Claire, there lives a woman. She was beautiful once
  &mdash; to me she is beautiful now. She was <i>my</i> woman until&mdash;' And
  his eyes sought the dead body of Henry Granger.</p>

  <p>"Ruth took a deep breath. 'Yes &mdash; until?' she whispered.</p>

  <p>"'Until he came,' said the man gravely. 'And God will decide between him
  and me. But I would have liked to look on her once more, and hold her hand,
  and tell her, yet again, that I understood &mdash; absolutely.'</p>

  <p>"It was then Ruth Granger crossed to him.</p>

  <p>"'What is her name and the number of the house?' she said.</p>

  <p>"'Sybil Deering is her name,' he answered slowly, 'and the number is
  fourteen.'</p>

  <p>"'Will you leave it to me?' she asked.</p>

  <p>"For a moment he stared at her in silence, then he bowed.</p>

  <p>"'From the bottom of my heart I thank you, Lady Granger, and I hope you
  will have all the happiness you deserve.' He glanced at Shoreham and smiled.
  'When a man loves everything else goes to the wall, doesn't it? Remember that
  in the future, Sir Edward, when they're standing before you, wondering,
  trying to read their fate. Someone loves them, just as you love her.'"</p>

  <p>The Barrister rose and drained his glass.</p>

  <p>"And that is the conclusion of your suffering," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Was the man hanged?" asked the Soldier.</p>

  <p>"No, he died a week later of galloping consumption.</p>

  <p>"And what of the other two?" demanded the Actor.</p>

  <p>"They married, and are living happily together today, doing fruit farming
  as a hobby."</p>

  <p>"Fruit farming!" echoed the Doctor. "Why fruit farming?"</p>

  <p>"Something to do," said the Barrister. "You see, Sir Edward has never
  tried another case. Some men are made that way."</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3">III.</a> &mdash; THE DOCTOR'S STORY,<br>
  BEING SENTENCE OF DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">"Sooner or later," began the Doctor, settling himself
comfortably in his
  chair, "it comes to most of us. Sooner or later a man or a woman comes to
  consult us on what they imagine to be some trifling malady, and when we make
  our examination we find that it isn't trifling. And occasionally we find that
  not only is the matter not trifling, but that &mdash; well, you all have seen
  Collier's picture, <i>The Sentence of Death</i>.</p>

  <p>"It's a thing, incidentally, which requires careful thought &mdash; just
  how much you will tell. Different people take things different ways, and
  where it might be your duty to tell one man the half-truth, to another it
  might be just as much your duty to lie. But broadly speaking, I, personally,
  have always maintained that, unless the circumstances are quite exceptional,
  it is a doctor's duty to tell a patient the truth, however unpleasant it may
  be. What would a man say if his lawyer or his stockbroker lied to him?</p>

  <p>"Which brings me to the opening of my story. It was in the May before the
  war that a man came into my consulting room &mdash; a man whom I will call
  Jack Digby. I motioned him to a chair on the other side of my desk, so placed
  that the light from the window fell on his face. I put him down as a man of
  about three-and-thirty who was used to an outdoor life. His face was bronzed,
  his hands were sunburnt, and the whole way he carried himself &mdash; the set
  of his shoulders, the swing of his arms as he walked across the room &mdash;
  indicated the athlete in good condition. In fact, he was an unusual type to
  find in a Harley Street consulting room, and I told him so by way of opening
  the conversation.</p>

  <p>"He grinned, a very pleasant, cheery grin, and put his hat on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"'Just a matter of form, Doctor,' he said, leaning back in his chair and
  crossing his legs. 'I'm thinking of entering for the matrimonial stakes, and
  before saddling up I thought I'd just get you to certify me sound in wind and
  limb.'</p>

  <p>"Now he spoke very easily and naturally, but something &mdash; I don't
  quite know what &mdash; made me look at him a little more closely. The study
  of human nature is a vital necessity if the study of human ailments is to be
  successful &mdash; and one gets plenty of opportunity for it if one is a
  consulting physician. And I suddenly wondered if it was 'just a matter of
  form' in his mind. The ordinary young, healthy man doesn't usually take the
  trouble to be overhauled by a doctor merely because he is going to be
  married.</p>

  <p>"However, at that stage of the proceedings my thoughts were my own, and I
  answered him in the same vein. And while he was taking off his coat and shirt
  we talked casually on various topics. Then I started my examination. And
  within half a minute I knew that something was very, very wrong.</p>

  <p>"'I would like you to take off your vest, please, Mr Digby,' I said, and
  for a moment he stared at me in silence. I was watching him quietly, and it
  was then I knew that my first surmise was correct. In his eyes there was a
  look of dreadful fear.</p>

  <p>"He stripped his vest off, and I continued my examination. And after I'd
  finished I walked over to my desk.</p>

  <p>"'You can put on your clothes again,' I said gravely, to swing round as I
  felt his hand like a vice on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"'What is it?' he muttered. 'Tell me.'</p>

  <p>"'It was not altogether a matter of form with you, was it, Mr Digby?' I
  answered. 'Put on your clothes; I want to ask you a few questions.'</p>

  <p>"'Hang it, man!' he cried. 'I can't wait. What have you found?'</p>

  <p>"'I would like to have another opinion before telling you.' I was fencing
  for time, but he was insistent.</p>

  <p>"'You can have another opinion &mdash; you can have fifty other opinions,'
  he cried, still gripping me by the shoulder &mdash; 'but I want to know what
  you think <i>now</i>. Can I marry?'</p>

  <p>"'You cannot,' I said gravely, and his hand fell to his side. Then he
  slowly walked across the room and stood with his back to me, staring out of
  the window. Once his shoulders shook a little, but except for that he stood
  quite motionless. And after a while he picked up his clothes and started to
  dress.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing until he had finished; with a man of his type talking is a
  mistake. It was not until he again sat down in the chair opposite me that I
  broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"'You asked me a specific question, Mr Digby,' I said quietly, 'and I
  answered as a man of your type would like to be answered. But I now want to
  modify my reply slightly. And I will put it this way. If I had a daughter, I
  would not allow a man whose heart was in the condition that yours is to marry
  her. It would not be fair to her; it would certainly not be fair to any
  possible children.'</p>

  <p>"He nodded gravely, though he didn't speak.</p>

  <p>"'You feared something of this sort when you came to me?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'My mother died of it,' he answered quietly. 'And once or twice lately,
  after exercise, I've had an agonising twinge of pain.' And then, under his
  breath, he added: 'Thank God, she doesn't know!'</p>

  <p>"'But I would like another opinion,' I continued. 'There are men, as you
  know, who are entirely heart specialists, and I will give you the address of
  one.'</p>

  <p>"'Confirmation of the death sentence,' he laughed grimly. 'No saddling up
  for me &mdash; eh, Doctor?'</p>

  <p>"'Not as you are at present, Mr Digby.' I was writing the address of the
  biggest heart man on a piece of paper, though I felt it was useless. It
  didn't require an expert to diagnose this trouble.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any chance of getting better?' he cried eagerly, and I stopped
  writing and looked at him. There was hope &mdash; a dawning hope in his eyes
  &mdash; and for a moment I hesitated.</p>

  <p>"My own opinion was that there was no chance: that he might, with care and
  luck, live for two or three years &mdash; perhaps more &mdash; but that he
  might equally well drop dead at any moment. It was enough &mdash; that
  momentary hesitation; the eager look in his eyes faded, and he sat back
  wearily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"'Don't bother,' he said slowly; 'I see how it is.'</p>

  <p>"'No, you don't, Mr Digby,' I answered. 'You see how I think it is. Which
  is an altogether different matter. There is always a chance.'</p>

  <p>"'That's juggling with words,' he said, with a twisted little smile. 'The
  great point is that I'm not in a position to ask this girl to marry me.'</p>

  <p>"He glanced at the slip of paper I handed to him, then he rose.</p>

  <p>"'I would like you to go and see him,' I said quietly. 'You see I feel the
  gravity of what I've had to tell you this morning very much, and in fairness
  to myself as well as to you, my dear fellow, I'd like you to go to Sir
  John.'</p>

  <p>"For a few seconds he stood there facing me, then he grinned as he had
  done at the beginning of the interview.</p>

  <p>"'All right, Doctor,' he cried. 'I'll go, and Sir John shall drive the
  nail right in.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm sorry,' I said &mdash; 'infernally sorry. You've taken it, if I may
  say so, like a very brave man.'</p>

  <p>"He turned away abruptly. 'What the deuce is the good of whining?' he
  cried. 'If it's the same as in my mother's case, the end will be very
  abrupt.'</p>

  <p>"The next moment he was gone &mdash; a man under sentence of death. And
  the pitiful tragedy of it hit one like a blow. He was so essentially the type
  of man who should have married some charming girl and have children. He was
  just a first-class specimen of the sporting Englishman, but&mdash;" The
  Doctor paused and looked at the Soldier. "The type that makes a first-class
  squadron leader," and the Soldier nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was in the afternoon," continued the Doctor after a while, "that Sir
  John Longworth rang me up. Digby had been to him, and the result was as I
  expected. Two years, or possibly two days, and as for marriage, out of the
  question entirely. He had merely confirmed my own diagnosis of the case, and
  there for a time the matter rested. In the stress of work Jack Digby passed
  from my mind, until Fate decreed that we should meet again in what were to
  prove most dramatic circumstances.</p>

  <p>"It was two months later &mdash; about the beginning of July &mdash; that
  I decided to take a short holiday. I couldn't really spare the time, but I
  knew that I ought to take one. So I ran down for a long weekend to stop with
  some people I knew fairly well in Dorsetshire. They had just taken a big
  house a few miles from Weymouth, and I will call them the Maitlands. There
  were Mr and Mrs Maitland, and a son, Tom, up at the 'Varsity, and a daughter,
  Sybil. When I arrived I found they had a bit of a house party, perhaps a
  dozen in all, and after tea the girl, whom I'd met once or twice before, took
  me round the place.</p>

  <p>"She was a charming girl, very, very pretty, of about twenty-two or three,
  and we chattered on aimlessly as we strolled through the gardens.</p>

  <p>"'You're quite a big party,' I laughed, 'and I thought I was coming for a
  quiet weekend.'</p>

  <p>"'We've got two or three more arriving tonight,' she said. 'At least I
  think so. One of them is a most elusive person.' She was staring straight in
  front of her as she spoke, and for the moment she seemed to have forgotten my
  existence.</p>

  <p>"'Male or female &mdash; the elusive one?' I asked lightly.</p>

  <p>"'A man,' she answered abruptly, and changed the con-versation.</p>

  <p>"But being an old and wary bird, I read into her harmless remark a
  somewhat deeper significance than was perhaps justified, and it struck me
  very forcibly that if I were the man I would not be elusive in the
  circumstances. She surely was most amazingly pretty."</p>

  <p>"With great deductive ability," murmured the Actor, as the Doctor paused
  to refill his pipe, "we place the elusive man as Jack Digby."</p>

  <p>"You go to blazes!" laughed the teller of the story. "I haven't got to
  that yet. Of course you're quite right &mdash; he was; though when I found it
  out a little later it came as a complete surprise to me. I'd almost forgotten
  his existence.</p>

  <p>"It was her father who first mentioned his name. I was having a sherry and
  bitters with him in his study before going up to dress for dinner, and the
  conversation turned on the girl. I think I said how extraordinarily pretty I
  thought she was, and remarked that I supposed somebody would soon be walking
  off with her.</p>

  <p>"Joe Maitland's face clouded a little.</p>

  <p>"'As a matter of fact,' he said, 'both her mother and I have been
  expecting it for some time. A most charming man, and Sybil is in love with
  him, I'm sure. We all thought that he was in love with her,' and then he
  exploded &mdash; 'damn it, it isn't a question of thinking, I <i>know</i>
  he's in love with her! And for some extraordinary reason he won't tell her
  so. He's kept away from her for the last two months, after having lived in
  her pocket. And he's not the type that monkeys round and makes a girl fond of
  him for no reason. He's coming here tonight, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"My host, still frowning slightly, lit a cigarette. So evidently this was
  the elusive man, I thought, putting down my glass. It was no business of
  mine, and then suddenly I stood very still as I heard him speak again.</p>

  <p>"'Jack Digby is as white as they're made,' he was saying, but I didn't
  hear any more. Luckily my back was towards him, so he couldn't see my face.
  Jack Digby! Poor devil! With Sybil Maitland, the girl, in his mind, the blow
  I'd given him must have been even crueller than I'd thought. And what a
  strange coincidence that I should be going to meet him again in such
  circumstances. Maitland was still rambling on, but I was paying no attention
  to him. I could, of course, say nothing unless Digby gave me permission; but
  it struck me that if I told him how the land lay &mdash; if I told him that
  not only was his silence being completely misconstrued, but that it was
  making the girl unhappy, he might allow me to tell her father the truth.
  After all, the truth was far better; there was nothing to be ashamed of in
  having a rotten heart.</p>

  <p>"And it was just as I had made up my mind to see Digby that night that the
  door opened and Tom, the boy, came in. I hadn't seen him since he was quite a
  child, and the first thing that struck me about him was that he was almost as
  good-looking as his sister. He'd got the same eyes, the same colouring, but
  &mdash; there was the devil of a but. Whereas his sister gave one the
  impression of being utterly frank and fearless, the boy struck me immediately
  as being the very reverse. That he was the apple of his mother's eye, I knew
  &mdash; but that signifies nothing. Thank God! mothers are made that way. And
  as I stood watching him talking to his father I recalled certain vague
  rumours that I'd heard recently and had paid scant attention to at the time.
  Rumours of wild extravagance up at Oxford &mdash; debts well into the four
  figures... They came back to my mind, those idle bits of gossip, and they
  assumed a definite significance as I studied the boy's face. It was weak
  &mdash; utterly weak; he gave one the impression of having no mental or moral
  stamina whatever. He poured himself out a glass of sherry, and his hand
  wasn't quite steady, which is a bad sign in a boy of under twenty-one. And he
  was a little frightened of his father, which is bad in a boy of any age when
  the father is a man like Joe Maitland. And that wasn't all, either. There was
  something more &mdash; something much bigger on his mind: I was sure of it.
  There was fear in his heart; you could see it lurking round his eyes &mdash;
  round his mouth. I glanced at Joe, but he seemed quite oblivious of it, and
  then I left them and went up to dress for dinner. I remember wondering as I
  turned into my room whether the boy had got into another scrape &mdash; then
  I dismissed him from my mind. Jack Digby was a more interesting and more
  pressing problem.</p>

  <p>"I met him in the hall as I came down, and he gave a sudden start of
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"'Why, Doctor,' he said quietly as we shook hands, 'this is a surprise.
  I'd no idea you were to be here.'</p>

  <p>"'Nor I that you were coming,' I answered 'until Mr Maitland happened to
  mention it a little while ago.'</p>

  <p>"'You haven't said anything to him, have you?' he cried anxiously.</p>

  <p>"'My dear fellow,' I said, 'you ought to know that doctors don't.' He
  muttered an apology, and I went on: 'You know, Digby, I can't help thinking
  you're making a mistake in not telling the truth.'</p>

  <p>"He shook his head vigorously. 'I'm sure I'm not,' he answered. 'The
  mistake I've made has been in coming here at all. I haven't seen her since
  the day &mdash; when you told me. And I oughtn't to have come now. It's the
  last &mdash; I swear that. I couldn't help it; I had to see her once again.
  I'm going to Africa in August &mdash; big game shooting.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him gravely, and after a while he went on: "'No one knows
  better than you,' he said gravely, 'my chance of returning. And when I don't
  come back &mdash; she'll forget me.' I saw his hands clench at his side. 'But
  if I tell her now &mdash; why, she'll want me to stop in England &mdash; to
  go to specialists &mdash; to eke out life to the full two or three years.
  It'll be hell &mdash; hell! Hell for both of us. Every day she'll be
  wondering if she is going to hear I'm dead; it'll ruin her life. Whereas
  Africa, if she doesn't know about my heart, will be sudden. You see, Doctor,
  she is the only one to be considered &mdash; the only one.'</p>

  <p>"I drew a deep breath; truly Joe Maitland had been right. This man was
  white clean through. And then he gave a little choking gasp, and, turning
  round, I saw the girl coming towards us across the hall.</p>

  <p>"'I didn't know you'd come, old man,' I heard her say, and then I moved
  away and left them. It was one of those occasions when you say it's the smoke
  that has got into your eyes &mdash; and you lie."</p>

  <p>For a while the Doctor was silent; then he gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"They sat next to one another at dinner, opposite me, and I'm afraid my
  partner must have thought I was a little wanting in intellect. They were such
  a perfectly ideal couple; and I noticed old Joe Maitland watching them every
  now and then. But gradually, as the meal progressed, a puzzled look began to
  creep into the girl's eyes, and once she bit her lip suddenly and turned
  abruptly to the man on her other side. It was then that Digby looked across
  the table at me, and in that moment I realised that he was right. For him to
  remain in England would be impossible for both of them; the end, quick and
  sudden in an African jungle &mdash; if he ever got as far &mdash; was the
  only way out.</p>

  <p>"'My God! Doctor,' he said as he came round and sat down next to me after
  the ladies had gone, 'I knew I was a fool to come, but I didn't think it was
  going to be as bad as this.'</p>

  <p>"'When are you going to start?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'As soon as I can get things fixed up at home, here, and make some sort
  of arrangement for carriers and people the other end. One must act, I
  suppose, even though it's the last appearance.' He gave a mirthless laugh.
  'I've always wanted to go south from Khartoum &mdash; I wonder how far I'll
  get.' Then he began to drum on the table with his fingers. 'And what I wonder
  still more,' he went on slowly, 'is how in Heaven's name I'll get through
  this evening. You see, though I didn't actually propose in so many words
  before I came to see you, I'd &mdash; I'd let things drift to such a position
  that a proposal was hardly necessary. That's the devil of it... She knows I
  worship the ground she walks on &mdash; and I know she cares too.'</p>

  <p>"'How long are you going to stop here?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'I accepted for the weekend,' he said abruptly. 'I shall go first thing
  tomorrow. I can't stand it.'</p>

  <p>"At that we left it, and I didn't speak to him again until the thing
  occurred which even now &mdash; though seven years have slipped by &mdash; is
  as clearly imprinted on my brain as if it had happened last night.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't sleep very well that night, and at about two I switched on my
  light, with the idea of reading. I was just reaching out for a book when I
  heard the sound of voices from a room almost opposite. I listened for a
  moment, then I got up and went to the door. For the voices were excited and
  angry; something unusual was evidently happening. For a moment or two I
  hesitated; then I slipped on a dressing gown and looked out. Across the
  passage the door of a room was open, and through it the light was streaming
  out. And then I heard Joe Maitland speak, and his words literally rooted me
  to the ground with amazement.</p>

  <p>"'So, Mr Digby, you're just a common damned thief. The gentleman crook
  &mdash; what? The amateur cracksman. That's what they call them on the stage,
  I believe. Sounds better. But I prefer the more homely name of thief.'</p>

  <p>"It was then that I appeared in the door, and Maitland swung round.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, it's you, is it, Tranton?' He had a revolver in his hand, and he
  lowered it when he saw who it was. 'A pretty tableau, isn't it? It appears
  that a second edition of &mdash; what was the gentleman's name &mdash;
  Raffles, wasn't it? &mdash; has been honouring me with his presence.
  Unfortunately, Tom and I both happened to hear him.'</p>

  <p>"But I was paying no attention to what he was saying; my eyes were fixed
  on Digby and &mdash; Tom. Digby, with a quiet smile on his face and his hands
  in his pockets, was standing beside an open safe. He was still in evening
  clothes, and once he glanced my way. Then he looked back again at his host,
  and I looked at Tom. He was in his dressing gown, and he was shivering as if
  he had the ague. He was standing close to his father, and a little behind him
  &mdash; and Joe Maitland was too engrossed with Digby to notice the condition
  he was in.</p>

  <p>"'Can you advance any reason, Mr Digby,' he demanded, 'why I shouldn't
  call up the local police?'</p>

  <p>"'None whatever, Mr Maitland,' he answered gravely. 'Your son caught me
  fair and square.'</p>

  <p>"And it seemed to me that Tom made an effort to speak, though no words
  came from his lips.</p>

  <p>"'You damned scoundrel!' cried Maitland. 'You come to my house &mdash; you
  make love to my daughter &mdash; and then you abuse my hospitality by trying
  to steal my wife's jewellery!"</p>

  <p>"It was at that moment that the girl came in. I saw Digby catch his breath
  and lean against the wall for support; then he straightened up and faced his
  host again. Just once had he glanced at her, with her glorious hair falling
  over her shoulders and a startled look of wonder in her great eyes. Then
  resolutely he looked away.</p>

  <p>"'What's happened, Daddy?' she whispered. 'I heard your voice
  and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'This has happened, my dear,' said Maitland grimly. 'We have been
  privileged to discover Mr Digby's method of earning a livelihood.' He pointed
  to the open safe. 'He apparently ingratiates himself with people for the
  express purpose of stealing their valuables. In other words, a common
  thief.'</p>

  <p>"'I don't believe it!' she flashed out imperiously. 'Jack &mdash; a thief!
  How can you say such a thing?'</p>

  <p>"'Then may I ask what he was doing when your brother discovered him by the
  open safe? Besides, he admits it himself.'</p>

  <p>"'Jack!' The cry seemed to come from the very depths of her soul. 'Say
  it's a lie!'</p>

  <p>"For one second he hesitated; then he spoke quite steadily, though he
  didn't look at her.</p>

  <p>"'I am afraid, Miss Maitland &mdash; that I can't say it's untrue.'</p>

  <p>And then there fell one of those silences that can be felt. She was
  staring at Jack Digby, was the girl &mdash; staring at him with a great
  amazement dawning on her face.</p>

  <p>"'Jack,' she whispered, 'look at me!'</p>

  <p>"He raised his eyes and looked at her, and a little pulse was beating just
  above his jaw. Then, after what seemed an interminable time, she gave a
  little laugh that was half a sob and turned away.</p>

  <p>"'I see,' she said below her breath. 'I see.'</p>

  <p>"But what it was she saw, I didn't at the moment realise. It was to be
  made clear a little later."</p>

  <p>The Doctor paused and threw a log on the fire.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I found out later what she thought," he went on after a while, "and
  for the first and probably the last time in my life I was guilty of a breach
  of professional confidence. It was about half an hour later that I went round
  to Jack Digby's room. Maitland, after thinking it over &mdash; and it is
  possible that I had something to do with his decision &mdash; had dismissed
  the idea of sending for the police. Digby was to clear out by the first train
  next morning, and was never to make an attempt to com-municate with the girl
  again. And Jack Digby had bowed in silence and gone to his own room. He
  wouldn't look at me as he passed; I think he knew that he hadn't deceived
  me.</p>

  <p>"He was sitting by the open window when I went in, still in his evening
  clothes, and he looked round with a start as I entered. His face was drawn
  and grey.</p>

  <p>"'My dear chap,' I said, before he could speak, 'is it worth while?'</p>

  <p>"'I don't understand what you mean, Doctor,' he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, yes, you do!' I answered. 'You deceived Mr Maitland all right
  &mdash; you didn't deceive me. It was Tom who opened the safe &mdash; not
  you.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment I thought he was going to deny it; then he gave a little
  mirthless laugh.</p>

  <p>"'Perfectly correct,' he said. 'As you say, it was Tom who opened the
  safe. I caught him absolutely in the act. And then Mr Maitland came.'</p>

  <p>"'But &mdash; good God!' I cried, 'what an unutterable young waster he
  must be to let you shoulder the blame!'</p>

  <p>"Digby faced me steadily. 'I made him. You see, I saw it was the chance I
  had been looking for.'</p>

  <p>"'You mean you told him about your heart?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' he answered quietly. 'But I told him I was entangled with another
  woman, and that the best way of saving his sister's feelings was to let her
  think&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"And then the boy broke down utterly. With his hands on my shoulders he
  stood there facing me, and he made me swear I wouldn't tell the girl.</p>

  <p>"'She must never know, Doctor. I've done it for her. She must never
  know.'</p>

  <p>"And even as he spoke, the words died away on his lips, and he stood
  motionless, staring past me at the door. Without looking round I knew what
  had happened &mdash; I could smell the faint scent she used.</p>

  <p>"'What have you done for me, Jack, and why must I never know?'</p>

  <p>"She came steadily up to him, and his hands fell to his side.</p>

  <p>"'Why, you've been crying, dear,' she said. 'What's the matter?'</p>

  <p>"True to his purpose, he started some fantastic story about sorrow at
  having been found out, but she cut him short.</p>

  <p>"'Don't lie, Jack &mdash; not now,' she whispered. 'I know it wasn't you
  who opened the safe. I know it was Tom. But what I want to know is why you
  said you did it.'</p>

  <p>"It was then I made up my mind.</p>

  <p>"'I'm going to tell her, Digby, whether you like it or not,' and she
  looked at me quickly. He didn't say anything; things had got beyond him. And
  very briefly I told her the truth about his heart.</p>

  <p>"She listened to me in absolute silence, and when I'd finished she just
  turned round to him and held out both her arms.</p>

  <p>"'Thank God! I know, my darling,' she whispered. 'I thought it was because
  you'd got fond of another woman. I thought &mdash; oh! Heaven knows what I
  thought! But now &mdash; oh! you stupid, wonderful boy!'</p>

  <p>"I went to the window and looked out! It must have been five minutes later
  that I found the girl at my side.</p>

  <p>"'Is it absolutely hopeless?' she asked.</p>

  <p>"'Humanly speaking,' I answered, 'yes.'</p>

  <p>"'How long?' and she put her hand on my arm.</p>

  <p>"'Two days; two months; at the utmost, two years,' I said gravely.</p>

  <p>"'And why shouldn't I look after him for those two years?' she demanded
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"'I'm thinking of a possible child,' I said quietly, and she began to
  tremble a little.</p>

  <p>"'That's ridiculous,' she cried &mdash; 'quite ridiculous.'</p>

  <p>The Doctor was carefully cleaning out the bowl of his pipe. "In the
  morning Jack Digby had gone, leaving behind him a note for her. She showed it
  to me later.</p>

  <p>"'The Doctor is right, my darling,' it ran. 'It's just Fate, and there's
  not much use kicking. I'm glad though that you know the truth &mdash; it
  helps. Goodbye, dear heart. God bless you.'"</p>

  <p>The Doctor paused.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" said the Ordinary Man.</p>

  <p>"Very nearly," answered the Doctor. "I had been right when I said two
  months, only the cause of death was not what I expected. How he got across
  the water so soon I don't know. But he did &mdash; in a cavalry regiment. And
  he stopped one &mdash; somewhere up Ypres way."</p>

  <p>"And the girl?" asked the Soldier.</p>

  <p>"Has not got over it yet," said the Doctor.</p>

  <p>"And did she ever hear from him again?" demanded the Barrister.</p>

  <p>"Once, from France. Written just before &mdash; the end. She didn't show
  me <i>that</i> one. Pass the whisky, Actor-man. Talking makes one's throat
  infernally dry."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4">IV. &mdash; THE ORDINARY MAN'S STORY,<br>
  BEING THE PIPES OF DEATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Any of you know Burma?" asked the Ordinary Man, putting
out his hand for
  the tobacco jar.</p>

  <p>"I've been there," grunted the Soldier. "Shooting. Years ago. West of the
  Irawadi from Rangoon."</p>

  <p>"It's years since I was there, too," said the Ordinary Man. "More than a
  score. And if I wasn't so beastly fat and lazy I'd like to go back for a
  visit. Only a visit, mind you. I've got to the time of life when I find that
  London is quite good enough for my needs. But the story which I propose to
  inflict on you fellows tonight concerns Burma, and delving into the past to
  get the details right has brought the fascination of the place back to
  me.</p>

  <p>"I was about thirty-five at the time &mdash; and my benevolent Aunt Jane
  had not then expired and endowed me with all her worldly goods. I was working
  for a City firm who had considerable interests out there &mdash; chiefly
  teak, with a strong sideline in rubies.</p>

  <p>"At that time, as you may know, the ruby mines in the Mandalay area were
  second to none, and it was principally to give my employers a report on the
  many clashing interests in those mines that I went back to England after a
  few months in the country. And it was in their office that I met a youngster,
  who had just joined the firm, and who, it turned out, was going out to Burma
  on the same boat as myself. Jack Manderby was his name, and I suppose he must
  have been ten or eleven years younger than I. He was coming to my district,
  and somewhat naturally I was a bit curious to see what sort of a fellow he
  was.</p>

  <p>"I took to him from the very first moment, and after we'd lunched together
  a couple of times my first impression was strengthened. He was a real good
  fellow &mdash; extraordinarily good-looking and straight as a die, without
  being in the least degree a prig.</p>

  <p>"We ran into a good south-westerly gale the instant we were clear of the
  Isle of Wight, which necessitated a period of seclusion on my part. In fact,
  my next appearance in public was at Gibraltar.</p>

  <p>"And the first person I saw as I came on deck was Jack Manderby. He was
  leaning over the side bargaining with some infernal robber below, and at his
  side was a girl. In the intervals of haggling he turned to her, and they both
  laughed; and as I stood for a few minutes watching them, it struck me that
  Master Jack had made good use of the four days since we left England. Then I
  strolled over and joined them.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, old man!' he cried, with a twinkle in his eyes. 'Is the rumour
  correct that you've been engaged in research work below, and had given orders
  not to be disturbed?'</p>

  <p>"'Your vulgar jests leave me unmoved,' I answered with dignity. 'At any
  rate, I appear to have arrived in time to save you being robbed. That man is
  a thief and the son of a thief, and all his children are thieves.'</p>

  <p>"Jack laughed; then he swung round to the girl.</p>

  <p>"'By the way, you haven't met Mr Walton, have you? This is Miss Felsted,
  old boy, who is going out to Rangoon.'</p>

  <p>"We shook hands, and no more was said at the time. But one thing was
  definitely certain. Whatever the girl was going to Rangoon for, the gain was
  Rangoon's. She was an absolute fizzer &mdash; looked you straight in the face
  with the bluest of eyes that seemed to have a permanent smile lurking in
  them. And then, suddenly, I noticed her left hand. On the third finger was a
  diamond ring. It couldn't be Jack she was engaged to, and I wondered idly who
  the lucky man was. Because he was lucky &mdash; infernally lucky.</p>

  <p>"I think," continued the Ordinary Man, pulling thoughtfully at his pipe,
  "that I first began to scent complications at Malta. We landed there for a
  few hours, and the idea was that Miss Felsted, Jack, and I should explore
  Valetta. Now, I don't quite know how, but we got separated. I spent a
  pleasant two hours with a naval pal in the Union Club, while Jack and the
  girl apparently went up by the narrow-gauge railway to Citta Vecchia, in the
  centre of the island. And since no one in the full possession of their senses
  would go on that line for fun, I wondered. I wondered still more when they
  came back to the ship. Jack was far too open and above-board to be very
  skilful at hiding his feelings. And something had happened that day.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it was no concern of mine. Jack's affairs were entirely his
  own; so were the girl's. But a ship is a dangerous place sometimes &mdash; it
  affords unequalled and unending opportunities for what in those days were
  known as flirtations, and today, I believe, are known as 'pashes'. And to get
  monkeying round with another fellow's fiancée &mdash; well, it leads to
  complications generally. However, as I said, it was no concern of mine, until
  it suddenly became so the evening before we reached Port Said.</p>

  <p>"I was talking to Jack on deck just before turning in. We were strolling
  up and down &mdash; the sea like a millpond, and almost dazzling with its
  phosphorescence.</p>

  <p>"'Is Miss Felsted going out to get married?' I asked him casually.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he answered abruptly. 'She's engaged to a man called
  Morrison.'</p>

  <p>"'Morrison,' I repeated, stopping and staring at him. 'Not Rupert
  Morrison, by any chance?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes. Rupert is his name. Do you know him?'</p>

  <p>"I'd pulled myself together by this time, and we resumed our stroll.</p>

  <p>"'I know Rupert Morrison quite well,' I answered. 'As distance goes in
  that country, Jack, he's a near neighbour of ours'; and I heard him catch his
  breath a little quickly.</p>

  <p>"'What sort of a fellow is he?' asked Jack quietly, and then he went on,
  which saved me the trouble of a reply: 'She hasn't seen him for four years.
  They got engaged before he left England, and now she's going out to marry
  him.'</p>

  <p>"'I see,' I murmured non-committally, and shortly afterwards I made my
  excuse and left him.</p>

  <p>"I didn't turn in at once when I got to my cabin, I wanted to try and get
  things sorted out in my mind. The first point, which was as obvious as the
  electric light over the bunk, was that if Jack Manderby was not in love with
  Molly Felsted he was as near to it as made no odds. The second and far more
  important point was one on which I was in the dark &mdash; was the girl in
  love with him? If so, it simplified matters considerably; but if not, if she
  was only playing the fool, there was going to be trouble when we got to
  Burma. And the trouble would take the form of Rupert Morrison. For the more I
  thought of it the more amazed did I become that such a girl could ever have
  become engaged to such a man.</p>

  <p>"Of course, four years is a long time, especially when they are passed in
  comparative solitude. I had no idea what sort of fellow Morrison had been
  when first he arrived in the country, but I had a very shrewd idea what
  manner of man he was now. Perhaps it had been the loneliness &mdash;
  loneliness takes some men worse than others &mdash; but, whatever the cause,
  Morrison, after four years in Burma, was no fit mate for such a girl as Molly
  Felsted. A brooding, sullen man, given to fierce fits of almost animal rage,
  a heavy drinker of the type who is never drunk, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Ordinary Man paused and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's unfair to mention the last point. After all, most of us did
  that without thinking; but the actual arrival of an English girl &mdash; a
  wife &mdash; who was to step, blindly ignorant, into her predecessor's shoes,
  so to speak, made one pause to think. Anyway, that was neither here nor
  there. What frightened me was the prospect of the girl marrying the Morrison
  of her imagination and discovering, too late, the Morrison of reality. When
  that happened, with Jack Manderby not five miles away, the fat was going to
  be in the fire with a vengeance.</p>

  <p>"It was after Colombo that matters came to a head. We left the P &amp; O
  there, and got into another boat going direct to Rangoon. The weather was
  glorious &mdash; hot as blazes by day, and just right at night. And it was
  after dinner one evening a couple of days before we were due in, that quite
  inadvertently I butted into the pair of them in a secluded spot on deck. His
  arms were round her, and they both sounded a bit incoherent. Of course, there
  was no use pretending I hadn't seen &mdash; they both looked up at me. I
  could only mutter my apology and withdraw. But I determined, even at the risk
  of being told to go to hell, to have a word with young Jack that night.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, old man,' I said to him a bit later, 'you've got a perfect
  right to request me to mind my own business, but I'm going to risk that. I
  saw you two tonight, kissing to beat the band &mdash; confound it all, there
  wasn't a dog's earthly of not seeing you &mdash; and what I want to know is
  where Morrison comes in, or if he's gone out?"</p>

  <p>"He looked at me a bit shamefacedly, then he lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"'Hugh,' he said, with a twisted sort of smile, 'I just worship the ground
  that girl walks on.'</p>

  <p>"'Maybe you do, Jack,' I answered. 'But the point is, what are her
  feelings on the matter?'</p>

  <p>"He didn't answer, and after a while I went on.</p>

  <p>"'This show is not my palaver,' I said ordering two whisky pegs from the
  bartender. 'It's nothing to do with me, except that you and I are going to
  share the same bungalow, which is within easy calling distance of Morrison's.
  Now, Morrison is a funny-tempered fellow, but, apart from that altogether,
  the situation seems strained to me. If she breaks off her engagement with him
  and marries you, well and good. But if she isn't going to do that, if she
  still intends to marry Morrison &mdash; well, then, old man, although I hold
  no brief for him, you're not playing the game. I'm no sky pilot, but do one
  thing or the other. Things are apt to happen, you know, Jack, when one's at
  the back of beyond and a fellow gets playing around with another fellow's
  wife &mdash; things which might make an English court of justice sit up and
  scratch its head.'</p>

  <p>"He heard me out in silence, then he nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"'I know it must seem to you that I wasn't playing the game,' he said
  quietly. 'But, believe me, it's not for want of asking on my part that Molly
  won't marry me. And I believe that she's as fond of me &mdash; almost &mdash;
  as I am of her.'</p>

  <p>"'Then why the &mdash; ?' I began, but he stopped me with a weary little
  gesture of his hand.</p>

  <p>"'She feels that she's bound to him in honour,' he went on. 'I've told her
  that there can't be much question of honour if she doesn't love him any more,
  but she seems to think that, as he has waited four years for her, she can't
  break her bargain. And she's very fond of him; if it hadn't been for fate
  chucking us together she would never have thought of not marrying him.
  Tonight we both forgot ourselves, I suppose; it won't occur again.'</p>

  <p>"He sat back staring out of the porthole. The smoke room was empty, and I
  fairly let myself go.</p>

  <p>"'You very silly idiot,' I exploded, 'do you imagine I've been delivering
  a homily on the sins of kissing another man's fiancée. What I want to get
  into your fat head is this. You're going to a place where the only white
  woman you'll see from year's end to year's end is that girl, if she marries
  Morrison. You can prattle about honour, and forgetting yourselves, and not
  letting it occur again, and it's worth the value of that used match. Sooner
  or later it will occur again, and it won't stop at kissing next time. And
  then Morrison will probably kill you, or you'll kill him, and there'll be the
  devil to pay. For Heaven's sake, man, look the thing square in the face.
  Either marry the girl, or cut her right out of your life. And you can only do
  that by cabling the firm &mdash; or I'll cable them for you from Rangoon
  &mdash; asking to be posted to another district. I shall be sorry, but I'd
  far rather lose you than sit on the edge of a young volcano.'</p>

  <p>"I left him to chew over what I'd said and went to bed, feeling infernally
  sorry for both of them. But the one fact over which there was no doubt
  whatever in my mind was that if Morrison married Molly Felsted, then Jack
  Manderby would have to be removed as far as geographically possible from
  temptation.</p>

  <p>"My remarks apparently had some effect, because the next day Jack
  buttonholed me on deck.</p>

  <p>"'I've told Molly what you said last night, old man, and we've been
  talking it over. Morrison is meeting her apparently at Rangoon, and she has
  agreed to tell him what has happened. And when he knows how the land lies
  it's bound to be all right. Of course, I'm sorry for him, poor devil,
  but&mdash;' and he went babbling on in a way common to those in love.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I didn't pay much attention; I was thinking of Morrison and
  wondering whether Jack's optimism was justified. Apart from his moroseness
  and drinking, there were other stories about the man &mdash; stories which
  are not good to hear about a white man. I'd never paid any heed to them
  before, but now they came back to me &mdash; those rumours of strange things,
  which only the ignorant sceptic pretends to scorn; strange things done in
  secret with native priests and holy men; strange things it is not well for
  the white man to dabble in. And someone had it that Rupert Morrison did more
  than dabble."</p>

  <p>The Ordinary Man paused and sipped his whisky.</p>

  <p>"He met the boat at Rangoon," he continued after a while, "and came on
  board. Evidently the girl wasted no time in telling him what had occurred,
  because it was barely ten minutes before I saw him coming towards Jack and
  myself. There was a smouldering look in his eyes, but outwardly he seemed
  quite calm. He gave me a curt nod, then he addressed himself exclusively to
  Jack.</p>

  <p>"'Miss Felsted has just made a somewhat unexpected announcement to me,' he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Jack bowed gravely. 'I am more than sorry, Mr Morrison,' he said, 'if it
  should appear to you that I have acted in any way caddishly.' He paused a
  little constrainedly and I moved away. The presence of a third person at such
  an interview helps nobody. But once or twice I glanced at them during the
  next quarter of an hour, and it seemed to me that, though he was trying to
  mask it, the look of smouldering fury in Morrison's eyes was growing more
  pronounced. From their attitude it struck me that Jack was protesting against
  some course of action on which the other was insisting, and I turned out to
  be right.</p>

  <p>"'Morrison has made the following proposal,' he said irritably to me when
  their conversation had finished. 'That Molly should be left here in Rangoon
  with the English chaplain and his wife &mdash; apparently he'd fixed that
  already &mdash; and that we &mdash; he and I &mdash; should both go up
  country for a month or six weeks. Neither of us to see her during that time,
  and at the end of it she to be free to choose. As he pointed out, I suppose
  quite rightly, he had been engaged to her for more than four years, and it
  was rather rough on him to upset everything for what might prove only a
  passing fancy, induced by being thrown together on board ship. Of course, I
  pointed out to him that this was no question of a passing fancy &mdash; but
  he insisted.'</p>

  <p>"'And you agreed?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'What else could I do?' he cried. 'Heaven knows I didn't want to &mdash;
  it's such awful rot and waste of time. But I suppose it is rather rough luck
  on the poor devil, and if it makes it any easier for him to have the agony
  prolonged a few weeks, it's up to me to give him that satisfaction.'</p>

  <p>"He went off to talk to the girl, leaving me smoking a cigarette
  thoughtfully; for, try as I would, I could not rid my mind of the suspicion
  that there was something behind this suggestion of Morrison's &mdash;
  something sinister. Fortunately, Jack would be under my eye &mdash; in my
  bungalow; but even so, I felt uneasy. Morrison had been too quiet for safety,
  bearing in mind what manner of man he was.</p>

  <p>"We landed shortly after and I went round to the club. I didn't see
  Morrison &mdash; he seemed to have disappeared shortly after his interview
  with Jack; but he had given the girl full directions as to how to get to the
  chaplain's house. Jack took her there, and I'd arranged with him that he
  should come round after and join me.</p>

  <p>"The first man I ran into was McAndrew &mdash; a leather-faced Scotsman
  from up my part of the country &mdash; who was down in Rangoon on
  business.</p>

  <p>"'Seen the bridegroom?' he grunted as soon as he saw me.</p>

  <p>"'Travelled out with the bride,' I said briefly, not over-anxious to
  discuss the matter.</p>

  <p>"'And what sort of a lassie is she?' he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"'Perfectly charming,' I answered, ringing the bell for a waiter.</p>

  <p>"'Is that so?' he said slowly, and our eyes met. 'Man,' he added still
  more slowly, 'it should not be, it should not be. Poor lassie! Poor
  lassie!'</p>

  <p>"And then Jack Manderby came in, and I introduced him to two or three
  other fellows. I'd arranged to go up country that evening &mdash; train to
  Mandalay, and ride from there the following morning &mdash; and Jack, of
  course, was coming with me. He had said goodbye to the girl; he wasn't going
  to see her again before he went up country, and we spent the latter part of
  the afternoon pottering round Rangoon. And it was as we were strolling down
  one of the native bazaars that he suddenly caught my arm.</p>

  <p>"'Look &mdash; there's Morrison!' he muttered. 'I distinctly saw his face
  peering out of that shop.'</p>

  <p>"I looked in the direction he was pointing. It was an ordinary native shop
  where one could buy ornaments and musical instruments and trash like that
  &mdash; but of Morrison I could see no sign.</p>

  <p>"'I don't see him,' I said; 'and anyway there is no reason why he
  shouldn't be in the shop if he wants to.'</p>

  <p>"'But he suddenly vanished,' persisted Jack, 'as if he didn't want to be
  seen.' He walked on with me slowly. 'I don't like that man, Hugh; I hate the
  swine. And it's not because of Molly, either.'</p>

  <p>"He shut up at that, and I did not pursue the topic. It struck me that we
  should have quite enough of Morrison in the next few weeks."</p>

  <p>The Ordinary Man paused and lit a cigarette; then he smiled a little
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I expected," he continued thoughtfully: "I certainly
  never said a word to Jack as to my vague suspicions. But all the time during
  the first fortnight, while he was settling down into the job, I had the
  feeling that there was danger in the air. And then, when nothing happened, my
  misgivings began to go.</p>

  <p>"After all, I said to myself, what could happen, anyway? And perhaps I had
  misjudged Rupert Morrison. On the two or three occasions that we met him he
  seemed perfectly normal; and though, somewhat naturally, he was not over
  effusive to Jack, that was hardly to be wondered at.</p>

  <p>"And then one morning Jack came to breakfast looking as if he hadn't slept
  very well. I glanced at him curiously, but made no allusion to his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"'Did you hear that music all through the night?' he said irritably,
  halfway through the meal. 'Some infernal native playing a pipe or something
  just outside my window.'</p>

  <p>"'Why didn't you shout at him to stop?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'I did. And I got up and looked.' He took a gulp of tea; then he looked
  at me as if he were puzzled.</p>

  <p>"'There was no one there that I could see. Only something black that moved
  over the compound, about the size of a kitten.'</p>

  <p>"'He was probably just inside the jungle beyond the clearing,' I said.
  'Heave half a brick at him if you hear it again.'</p>

  <p>"We said no more, and I dismissed the matter from my mind. I was on the
  opposite side of the bungalow, and it would take more than a native playing
  on a pipe to keep me awake. But the following night the same thing happened
  &mdash; and the next, and the next.</p>

  <p>"'What sort of a noise is it?' I asked him. 'Surely to Heaven you're
  sufficiently young and healthy not to be awakened by a bally fellow
  whistling?'</p>

  <p>"'It isn't that that wakes me, Hugh,' he answered slowly. 'I wake before
  it starts. Each night about the same time I suddenly find myself wide awake
  &mdash; listening. Sometimes it's ten minutes before it starts &mdash;
  sometimes almost at once; but it always comes. A faint, sweet whistle &mdash;
  three or four notes, going on and on &mdash; until I think I'll go mad. It
  seems to be calling me.'</p>

  <p>"'But why the devil don't you go and see what it is?' I cried
  peevishly.</p>

  <p>"'Because' &mdash; and he stared at me with a shamefaced expression in his
  eyes &mdash; 'because I daren't.'</p>

  <p>"'Rot!' I said angrily. 'Look here, young fellow, nerves are bad things
  anywhere &mdash; here they're especially bad. You pull yourself
  together.'</p>

  <p>"He flushed all over his face, and shut up like an oyster, which made me
  rather sorry I'd spoke so sharply. But one does hear funny noises in the
  jungle, and it doesn't do to become fanciful.</p>

  <p>"And then one evening McAndrew came over to dinner. It was during the meal
  that I mentioned Jack's nocturnal serenader, expecting that Mac would treat
  it as lightly as I did.</p>

  <p>"'Seven times you've heard him, Jack, haven't you,' I said, 'and always
  the same tune?'</p>

  <p>"'Always the same tune,' he answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"'Can you whistle it now?' asked McAndrew, laying down his knife and fork
  and staring at Jack.</p>

  <p>"'Easily,' said Jack. 'It goes like this' &mdash; and he whistled about
  six notes. 'On and on it goes &mdash; never varying &mdash; Why, McAndrew,
  what the devil is the matter?'</p>

  <p>"I glanced at McAndrew in amazement; then out of the corner of my eye I
  saw the native servant, who was shivering like a jelly.</p>

  <p>"'Man &mdash; are you sure?' said Mac, and his face was white.</p>

  <p>"'Of course I'm sure,' answered Jack quietly. 'Why?'</p>

  <p>"'That tune you whistled &mdash; is not good for a white man to hear.' The
  Scotsman seemed strangely uneasy. 'And ye've heard it seven nights? Do you
  know it, Walton?'</p>

  <p>"'I do not,' I said grimly. 'What's the mystery?'</p>

  <p>"But McAndrew was shaking his head dourly, and for a while he did not
  answer.</p>

  <p>"'Mind ye,' he said at length, 'I'm not saying there's anything in it at
  all, but I would not care to hear that whistled outside my window. I heard it
  once &mdash; years ago &mdash; when I was 'way up in the Arakan Mountains.
  Soft and sweet it was &mdash; rising and falling in the night air, and going
  on ceaselessly. 'Way up above me was a monastery, one into which no white man
  has ever been. And the noise was coming from there. I had to go; my servants
  wouldn't stop. And when I asked them why, they told me that the priests were
  calling for a sacrifice. If they stopped, they told me, it might be one of
  us. That no one could tell how Death would come, or to whom, but come it must
  &mdash; when the Pipes of Death were heard. And the tune you whistled,
  Manderby, was the tune the Pipes of Death were playing.'</p>

  <p>"'But that's all bunkum, Mac,' I said angrily. 'We're not in the Arakans
  here.'</p>

  <p>"'Maybe,' he answered doggedly. 'But I'm a Highlander, and &mdash; I would
  not care to hear that tune.'</p>

  <p>"I could see Jack was impressed; as a matter of fact I was myself &mdash;
  more than I cared to admit. Sounds rot here, I know, but out there, with the
  dim-lit forest around one, it was different.</p>

  <p>"McAndrew was stopping with us that night. Jack, with the stubbornness of
  the young, had flatly refused to change his room, and turned in early, while
  Mac and I sat up talking. And it was not till we went to bed ourselves that I
  again alluded to the whistle.</p>

  <p>"'You don't really think it meant anything, Mac, do you?' I asked him, and
  he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'Maybe it is just a native who has heard it,' he said guardedly, and
  further than that he refused to commit himself.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was about two o'clock when I was awakened by a hand being
  thrust through my mosquito curtains.</p>

  <p>"'Walton, come at once!' It was McAndrew's voice, and it was shaking.
  'There's devil's work going on, I tell you &mdash; devil's work.'</p>

  <p>"I was up in a flash, and together we crept along the passage towards
  Jack's room. Almost instinctively I'd picked up a gun, and I held it ready as
  we paused by the door.</p>

  <p>"'Do you hear it?' whispered Mac a little fearfully, and I nodded. Sweet
  and clear the notes rose and fell, on and on and on in the same cadence.
  Sometimes the whistler seemed to be far away, at others almost in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"'It's the tune,' muttered McAndrew, as we tiptoed towards the bed. 'The
  Pipes of Death. Are ye awake, boy?'</p>

  <p>"And then he gave a little cry and gripped my arm.</p>

  <p>"'In God's name,' he whispered, 'what's that on the pillow beside his
  head?'</p>

  <p>"For a while in the dim light I couldn't make out. There was something big
  and black and motionless on the white pillow, and I crept nearer to see what
  it was. And then suddenly my heart seemed to stand still. I saw two beady,
  unwinking eyes staring at Jack's face close by; I saw Jack's eyes wide open
  and sick with terror staring at the thing which shared his bed. And still the
  music went on outside.</p>

  <p>"'What is it?' I muttered through dry lips.</p>

  <p>"'Give me your gun, man,' whispered McAndrew hoarsely. 'If the pipes stop,
  the boy's doomed.'</p>

  <p>"Slowly he raised the gun an inch at a time, pushing the muzzle forward
  with infinite care towards the malignant, glowing eyes, until at last the gun
  was almost touching its head. And at that moment the music died away and
  stopped altogether. I had the momentary glimpse of two black feelers shooting
  out towards Jack's face &mdash; then came the crack of the gun. And with a
  little sob Jack rolled out of bed and lay on the floor half-fainting, while
  the black mass on the pillow writhed and writhed and then grew still.</p>

  <p>"We struck a light, and stared at what was left of the thing in silence.
  And it was Jack who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"'I woke,' he said unsteadily, 'to feel something crawling over me on the
  bed. Outside that infernal whistling was going on, and at last I made out
  what was &mdash; what was &mdash; My God!' he cried thickly, 'what was it,
  Mac &mdash; what was it?'</p>

  <p>"'Steady, boy!' said McAndrew. 'It's dead now, anyway. But it was touch
  and go. I've seen 'em bigger than that up in the Arakans. It's a
  bloodsucking, poisonous spider. They're sacred to some of the sects.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly out of the jungle came one dreadful, piercing cry.</p>

  <p>"'What was that?' Jack muttered, and McAndrew shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'We'll find out tomorrow,' he said. 'There are strange things abroad
  tonight.'</p>

  <p>"We saw the darkness out &mdash; the three of us &mdash; round a bottle of
  whisky.</p>

  <p>"'They've been trying to get you for a week, Manderby,' said the Scotsman.
  'Tonight they very near succeeded.'</p>

  <p>"'But why?' cried Jack. 'I've never done 'em any harm.'</p>

  <p>"McAndrew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'Don't ask me that,' he answered. 'Their ways are not our ways.'</p>

  <p>"'Has that brute been in my room every night?' the boy asked.</p>

  <p>"'Every night,' answered McAndrew gravely. 'Probably two of them. They
  hunt them in pairs. They starve 'em, and then, when the music stops, they
  feed.' He thoughtfully poured out some more whisky.</p>

  <p>"And then at last came the dawn, and we went out to investigate. It was
  Jack who found him. The face was puffed and horrible, and as we approached,
  something black, about the size of a big kitten, moved away from the body and
  shambled sluggishly into the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>"'You're safe, boy,' said McAndrew slowly. 'It was not the priests at all.
  Just murder &mdash; plain murder.'</p>

  <p>"And with that he took his handkerchief and covered the dreadful, staring
  eyes of Rupert Morrison."</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">V. &mdash; THE SOLDIER'S STORY,<br>
  BEING A BIT OF ORANGE PEEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You can set your minds at rest about one thing, you
fellows," began the
  Soldier, with a grin. "My yarn isn't about the war. There have been quite
  enough lies told already about that performance without my adding to the
  number. No; my story concerns peace soldiering, and, strangely enough, I had
  an ocular demonstration when dining at the Ritz two nights ago that
  everything had finished up quite satisfactorily, in the approved storybook
  manner. At least, when I say quite satisfactorily &mdash; there was a price,
  and it was paid by one of the principal actors. But that is the unchangeable
  rule: one can but shrug one's shoulders and pay accordingly.</p>

  <p>"The regiment &mdash; I was a squadron-leader at the time &mdash; was
  quartered at Murchester. Not a bad station at all: good shooting, very fair
  hunting, especially if you didn't scorn the carted stag, polo, and most
  excellent cricket. Also some delightful houses in the neighbourhood; and as
  we'd just come home from our foreign tour we found the place greatly to our
  liking. London was an hour and a bit by train; in fact, there are many worse
  stations in England than the spot I have labelled Murchester.</p>

  <p>"The only fly in the ointment when we first arrived was a fairly natural
  one, and a thing which only time could cure. The men were a bit restive. We'd
  been abroad, don't forget, for more than ten years &mdash; India, Egypt,
  South Africa &mdash; and the feel of the old country under their feet
  unsettled 'em temporarily. Nothing very bad, but an epidemic of absence
  without leave and desertion broke out, and the officers had to settle down to
  pull things together. Continual courts-martial for desertion don't do a
  regiment any good with the powers that be, and we had to stop it.</p>

  <p>"Of course, one of the first things to look to, when any trouble of that
  sort is occurring, is the general type and standard of your NCOs. In my
  squadron they were good, though just a little on the young side. I remember
  one day I discussed the matter pretty thoroughly with the squadron
  sergeant-major &mdash; an absolute top-notcher.</p>

  <p>"'They're all right, sir,' he said. 'In another two or three years there
  will be none better in the British Army. Especially Trevor.'</p>

  <p>"'Ah! Sergeant-Major,' I said, looking him straight in the face, 'you
  think Trevor is a good man, do you?'</p>

  <p>"'The best we've got, sir,' he answered quietly, and he stared straight
  back at me.</p>

  <p>"'You weren't so sure when he first came,' I reminded him.</p>

  <p>"'Well, I reckon there was a bit of jealousy, sir,' he replied, 'his
  coming in from the link regiment over a good many of the chaps' heads. But
  he's been with us now three months &mdash; and we know him better.'</p>

  <p>"'I wish I could say the same,' I answered. 'He defeats me, does Sergeant
  Trevor.'</p>

  <p>"The Sergeant-Major smiled quietly. 'Does he, sir? I shouldn't have
  thought he would have. That there bloke Kipling has written about the likes
  of Trevor.'</p>

  <p>"'Kipling has written a good deal about the Army,' I said, with an
  answering smile. 'Mulvaney and Co are classics.'</p>

  <p>"'It's not Mulvaney I'm meaning, sir,' he answered. 'But didn't he write a
  little bit of poetry about "Gentlemen-rankers out on the spree"?'</p>

  <p>"'Why, yes, he did.' I lit a cigarette thoughtfully. 'I'd guessed that
  much, Manfield. Is Trevor his real name?'</p>

  <p>"'I don't know, sir,' and at that moment the subject of our discussion
  walked past and saluted.</p>

  <p>"'Sergeant Trevor,' I called after him, on the spur of the moment, and he
  came up at the double. I hadn't anything really to say to him, but ever since
  he'd joined us he'd puzzled me, and though, as the sergeant-major said, the
  other non-commissioned officers might know him better, I certainly
  didn't.</p>

  <p>"'You're a bit of a cricketer, aren't you?' I said, as he came up.</p>

  <p>"A faint smile flickered across his face at my question. 'I used to play
  quite a lot, sir,' he answered.</p>

  <p>"'Good; we want to get games going really strong.' I talked with them both
  &mdash; squadron 'shop' &mdash; a bit longer, and all the time I was trying
  to probe behind the impassive mask of Trevor's face. Incidentally, I think he
  knew it; once or twice I caught a faint gleam of amusement in his eyes
  &mdash; a gleam that seemed to me a little weary. And when I left them and
  went across the parade ground towards the mess, his face haunted me. I hadn't
  probed &mdash; not the eighth of an inch; he was still as much a mystery as
  ever. But he'd got a pair of deep blue eyes, and though I wasn't a girl to be
  attracted by a man's eyes, I couldn't get his out of my mind. They baffled
  me; the man himself baffled me &mdash; and I've always disliked being
  baffled.</p>

  <p>"It was a few nights after, in mess, that the next piece in the puzzle
  came along. We had in the regiment &mdash; he was killed in the war, poor
  devil! &mdash; a fellow of the name of Blenton, a fairly senior captain. He
  wasn't in my squadron, and his chief claim to notoriety was as a cricketer.
  Had he been able to play regularly he would have been easily up to
  first-class form &mdash; as it was he periodically turned out for the county;
  but he used to go in first wicket down for the Army. So you can gather his
  sort of form.</p>

  <p>"It was over the port that the conversation cropped up, and it interested
  me because it was about Trevor. As far as cricket was concerned I hardly knew
  which end of a bat one held.</p>

  <p>"'Dog-face has got a winner,' I heard Blenton say across the table. I may
  say that I answered to that tactful sobriquet, for reasons into which we need
  not enter. 'One Sergeant Trevor in your squadron, old boy,' he turned to me.
  'I was watching him at the nets tonight.'</p>

  <p>"'Is he any good?' I said.</p>

  <p>"'My dear fellow,' answered Blenton, deliberately, 'he is out and away the
  best bat we've had in the regiment for years. He's up to Army form!'</p>

  <p>"'Who's that?' demanded the commanding officer, sitting up and taking
  notice at once.</p>

  <p>"'Sergeant Trevor in B squadron, Colonel,' said Blenton. 'I was watching
  him this evening at nets. Of course, the bowling was tripe, but he's in a
  completely different class to the average soldier cricketer.'</p>

  <p>"'Did you talk to him?' I asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"'I did. And he struck me as being singularly uncom-municative. Asked him
  where he learnt his cricket, and he hummed and hawed, and finally said he'd
  played a lot in his village before joining the Army. I couldn't quite make
  him out, Dog-face. And why the devil didn't he play for us out in
  Jo'burg?'</p>

  <p>"'Because he only joined a couple of months before we sailed,' I answered.
  'Came with that last draft we got.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, I wish we had a few more trained in his village,' said Blenton.
  'We could do with them.'</p>

  <p>"After mess, I tackled Philip Blenton in the anteroom.</p>

  <p>"'What's your candid opinion of Trevor, Philip?' I demanded.</p>

  <p>"He stopped on his way to play bridge, and bit the end off his cigar.</p>

  <p>"'As a cricketer,' he said, 'or as a man?'</p>

  <p>"'Both,' I answered.</p>

  <p>"'Well, my candid opinion is that he learned his game at a first-class
  public school,' he replied. 'And I am further of the opinion, from the few
  words I spoke to him, that one would have expected to find him here and not
  in the Sergeants' Mess. What's his story? Do you know?'</p>

  <p>"'I don't.' I shook my head. 'Haven't an idea. But you've confirmed my own
  impressions.'</p>

  <p>"And there I had to leave it for some months. Periodically I talked to
  Trevor, deliberately tried to trap him into some admission which would give
  me a clue to his past, but he was as wary as a fox and as close as an oyster.
  I don't know why I took the trouble &mdash; after all, it was his business
  entirely, but the fellow intrigued me. He was such an extraordinarily fine
  NCO, and there was never a sign of his hitting the bottle, which is the end
  of a good many gentlemen-rankers. Moreover, he didn't strike me as a fellow
  who had come a cropper, which is the usual cause of his kind.</p>

  <p>"And then one day, when I least expected it, the problem began to solve
  itself. Philip Blenton rang me up in the morning after breakfast, from a
  house in the neighbourhood, where he was staying for a couple of two-day
  matches. Could I possibly spare Sergeant Trevor for the first of them?
  Against the I Z, who had brought down a snorting team, and Carter &mdash; the
  Oxford blue &mdash; had failed the local eleven at the last moment. If I
  couldn't they'd have to rake in one of the gardeners, but they weren't too
  strong as it was.</p>

  <p>So I sent for Trevor, and asked him if he'd care to play. I saw his eyes
  gleam for a moment; then he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'I think not, thank you, sir,' he said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"It's not quite like you to let Captain Blenton down, Trevor,' I remarked.
  'He's relying on you.'</p>

  <p>"I knew it was the right note to take with him, and I was very keen on his
  playing. I was going out myself that afternoon to watch, and I wanted to see
  him in different surroundings. We argued for a bit &mdash; I knew he was as
  keen as mustard in one way to play &mdash; and after a while he said he
  would. Then he went out of the office, and as it happened I followed him.
  There was an old cracked mirror in the passage outside, and as I opened the
  door he had just shut behind him, I had a glimpse of Sergeant Trevor
  examining his face in the glass. He'd got his hand so placed that it blotted
  out his moustache, and he seemed very intent on his reflection. Then he saw
  me, and for a moment or two we stared at one another in silence.
  Squadron-leader and troop-sergeant had gone; we were just two men, and the
  passage was empty. And I acted on a sudden impulse, and clapped him on the
  back.</p>

  <p>"'Don't be a fool, man,' I cried. 'Is there any reason why you shouldn't
  be recognised?'</p>

  <p>"'Nothing shady, Major,' he answered, quietly. 'But if one starts on a
  certain course, it's best to go through with it!'</p>

  <p>"At that moment the pay-sergeant appeared, and Trevor pulled himself
  together, saluted smartly, and was gone.</p>

  <p>"I suppose these things are planned out beforehand," went on the Soldier,
  thoughtfully. "To call it all blind chance seems a well-nigh impossible
  solution to me. And yet the cynic would assuredly laugh at connecting a child
  eating an orange in a back street in Oxford, and the death while fishing in
  Ireland of one of the greatest-hearted men that ever lived. But unless that
  child had eaten that orange, and left the peel on the pavement for Carter,
  the Oxford blue, to slip on and sprain his ankle, the events I am going to
  relate would, in all probability, never have taken place. However, since
  delving too deeply into cause and effect inevitably produces insanity, I'd
  better get on with it.</p>

  <p>"I turned up about three o'clock at Crosby Hall, along with four or five
  other fellows from the regiment. Usual sort of stunt &mdash; marquee and
  lemonade, with whisky in the background for the hopeless cases. The I Z
  merchants were in the field, and Trevor was batting. There was an Eton boy in
  with him, and the score was two hundred odd for five wickets. Philip Blenton
  lounged up as soon as he saw me, grinning all over his face.</p>

  <p>"'Thank Heaven you let him come, old man! He's pulled eighty of the best
  out of his bag already, and doesn't look like getting out.'</p>

  <p>"'He wouldn't come at first, Philip,' I said, and he stared at me in
  surprise. 'I think he was afraid of being recognised.'</p>

  <p>"A burst of applause greeted a magnificent drive past cover point, and for
  a while we watched the game in silence, until another long round of cheering
  announced that Sergeant Trevor had got his century. As I've said before, I'm
  no cricketer, but there was no need to be an expert to realise that he was
  something out of the way. He was treating the by-no-means-indifferent I Z
  bowling with the utmost contempt, and old Lord Apson, our host, was beside
  himself with joy. He was a cricket maniac; his week was an annual fixture;
  and for the first time for many years he saw his team really putting it
  across the I Z. And it was just as I was basking in a little reflected glory
  that I saw a very dear old friend of mine arrive in the enclosure,
  accompanied by a perfectly charming girl.</p>

  <p>"'Why, Yeverley, old man!' I cried, 'how are you?'</p>

  <p>"'Dog-face, as I live!' he shouted, seizing me by both hands. 'Man-alive,
  I'm glad to see you. Let me introduce you to my wife; Doris, this is Major
  Chilham &mdash; otherwise Dog-face.'</p>

  <p>"I shook hands with the girl, who was standing smiling beside him, and for
  a while we stopped there talking. He was fifteen years or so older than I,
  and had left the service as a Captain, but we both came from the same part of
  the country, and in days gone by I'd known him very well indeed. His marriage
  had taken place four years previously while I was abroad, and now, meeting
  his wife for the first time, I recalled bit by bit the gossip I'd heard in
  letters I got from home. How to everyone's amazement he'd married a girl
  young enough to be his daughter; how everybody had prophesied disaster, and
  affirmed that she was not half good enough for one of the elect like Giles
  Yeverley; how she'd been engaged to someone else and thrown him over. And yet
  as I looked at them both it struck me that the Jeremiahs had as usual been
  completely wrong: certainly nothing could exceed the dog-like devotion in
  Giles' eyes whenever he looked at his wife.</p>

  <p>"We strolled over to find some easy chairs, and he fussed round her as if
  she was an invalid. She took it quite naturally and calmly with a faint and
  charming smile, and when he finally bustled away to talk to Apson, leaving me
  alone with her, she was still smiling.</p>

  <p>"'You know Giles well?' she said.</p>

  <p>"'Awfully well,' I answered. 'And having now returned from my sojourn in
  the wilds, I hope I shall get to know his wife equally well.'</p>

  <p>"'That's very nice of you, Dog-face' &mdash; she turned and looked at me
  &mdash; and, by Jove, she was pretty. 'If you're anything like Giles &mdash;
  you must be a perfect dear.'</p>

  <p>"Now I like that sort of a remark when it's made in the right way. It
  establishes a very pleasant footing at once, with no danger of
  misconstruction &mdash; like getting on good terms with a new horse the
  moment you put your feet in the irons, instead of messing around for half the
  hunt. Anyway, for the next ten minutes or so I didn't pay very much attention
  to the cricket. I gathered that there was one small son &mdash; Giles junior
  &mdash; who was the apple of his father's eye; and that at the moment a heavy
  love affair was in progress between the young gentleman aged three and the
  General's daughter, who was as much as four, and showed no shame over the
  matter whatever. Also that Giles and she were stopping with the General and
  his wife for a week or ten days.</p>

  <p>"And it was at that stage of the proceedings that a prolonged burst of
  applause made us look at the cricket. Sergeant Trevor was apparently out
  &mdash; how I hadn't an idea &mdash; and was halfway between the wickets and
  the tent next to the one in which we were sitting, and which Apson always had
  erected for the local villagers and their friends. I saw them put up one
  hundred and twenty-five on the board as Trevor's score, and did my share in
  the clapping line.</p>

  <p>"'A fine player &mdash; that fellow,' I said, following him with my eyes.
  'Don't know much about the game myself, but the experts tell me&mdash;' And
  at that moment I saw her face, and stopped abruptly. She had gone very white,
  and her knuckles were gleaming like the ivory on the handle of her
  parasol.</p>

  <p>"'Major Chilham,' she said &mdash; and her voice was the tensest thing
  I've ever heard &mdash; 'who is that man who has just come out?'</p>

  <p>"'Trevor is his name,' I answered, quietly. 'He's one of the troop-
  sergeants in my squadron.' I was looking at her curiously, as the colour
  slowly came back to her face. 'Why? Did you think you knew him?'</p>

  <p>"'He reminded me of someone I knew years ago,' she said, sitting back in
  her chair. 'But of course I must have been mistaken.'</p>

  <p>"And then rather abruptly she changed the conversation, though every now
  and then she glanced towards the next tent, as if trying to see Trevor. And
  sitting beside her I realised that there was something pretty serious in the
  wind. She was on edge, though she was trying not to show it &mdash; and
  Trevor was the cause, or the man who called himself Trevor. All my curiosity
  came back, though I made no allusion to him; I was content to await further
  developments.</p>

  <p>"They weren't long in coming. The house team, with the respectable total
  of three hundred and fifty odd, were all out by teatime, and both elevens
  forgathered in the tent behind. All, that is, except Trevor, who remained in
  the other until Apson himself went and pulled him out. I watched the old man,
  with his cheery smile, take Trevor by the elbow and literally drag him out of
  his chair; I watched Trevor in his blue undress jacket, smart as be damned,
  coming towards us with our host. And then very deliberately I looked at Giles
  Yeverley's wife. She was staring over my head at the two men; then she
  lowered her parasol.</p>

  <p>"'So you weren't mistaken after all, Mrs Giles,' I said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"'No, Dog-face, I wasn't,' she answered. 'Would you get hold of Giles for
  me, and tell him I'd like to get back. Say I'm not feeling very well.'</p>

  <p>"I got up at once and went in search of her husband. I found him talking
  to the Zingari captain and Sergeant Trevor. He seemed quite excited,
  appealing as he spoke to the I Z skipper, while Trevor stood by listening
  with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"'What he says is quite right, Sergeant Trevor,' remarked the Zingari man
  as I came up. 'If you cared to consider it &mdash; you are absolutely up to
  the best county form. Of course, I don't know about your residential
  qualifications, but that can generally be fixed.'</p>

  <p>"'Dog-face,' cried Yeverley, as soon as he saw me, 'he's in your squadron,
  isn't he? Well, it's so long since I left the Army that I've forgotten all
  about discipline &mdash; but I tell you here &mdash; right now in front of
  him &mdash; that Sergeant Trevor ought to chuck soldiering and take up
  professional cricket. Bimbo here agrees with me.'</p>

  <p>"'Giles, you'll burst your waistcoat if you get so excited,' I remarked,
  casually. 'And, incidentally, Mrs Yeverley wants to go home.'</p>

  <p>"As I said the name I looked at Trevor, and my last doubt vanished. He
  gave a sudden start, which Giles, who had immediately torn off to his wife,
  didn't see, and proceeded to back into the farthest corner of the tea tent.
  But once again old Apson frustrated him. Not for him the endless pauses and
  waits of first-class cricket; five minutes to roll the pitch and he was
  leading his team into the field. Trevor had to go from his sanctuary, and
  there was only one exit from the enclosure in front of the tent.</p>

  <p>"They met &mdash; Mrs Giles and Trevor &mdash; actually at that exit. By
  the irony of things, I think it was Giles who caused the meeting. He hurried
  forward as he saw Trevor going out, and caught him by the arm; dear old chap!
  &mdash; he was cricket mad if ever a man was. And so blissfully unconscious
  of the other, bigger thing going on right under his nose.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you forget what I said, Trevor,' he said, earnestly. 'Any county
  would be glad to have you. I'm going to talk to Major Chilham about it
  seriously.'</p>

  <p>"And I doubt if Trevor heard a word. Over Giles' shoulder he was staring
  at Giles' wife &mdash; and she was staring back at him, while her breast rose
  and fell in little gasps, and it seemed to me that her lips were trembling.
  Then it was over; Trevor went out to field &mdash; Giles bustled back to his
  wife. And I, being a hopeless case, went in search of alcohol."</p>

  <p>The Soldier paused to light another cigar.</p>

  <p>"He carried out his threat, did Giles with regard to me. Two or three days
  later I lunched with the General, and it seemed to me that we never got off
  the subject of Trevor. It wasn't only his opinion; had not Bimbo Lawrence,
  the I Z captain, and one of the shrewdest judges of cricket in England,
  agreed with him? And so on without cessation about Trevor, the cricketer,
  while on the opposite side of the table, next to me, sat his wife, who could
  not get beyond Trevor, the man. Once or twice she glanced at me appealingly,
  as if to say: 'For God's sake, stop him!' &mdash; but it was a task beyond my
  powers. I made one or two abortive attempts, and then I gave it up. The
  situation was beyond me; one could only let him ramble on and pray for the
  end of lunch.</p>

  <p>"And then he left the cricket and came to personalities.</p>

  <p>"'Know anything about him, Dog-face?' he asked. 'Up at old Apson's place
  he struck me as being a gentleman. Anyway, he's a darned nice fellow. Wonder
  why he enlisted?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, Giles, for goodness' sake, let's try another topic?' said his wife,
  suddenly. 'We've had Sergeant Trevor since lunch began.'</p>

  <p>"Poor old Giles looked at her in startled surprise, and she gave him a
  quick smile which robbed her words of their irritability. But I could see she
  was on the rack, and though I didn't know the real facts, it wasn't hard to
  make a shrewd guess as to the cause.</p>

  <p>"It was just before we rose from the table, I remember, that she said to
  me under the cover of the general conversation: 'My God! Dog-face &mdash;
  it's not fair.'</p>

  <p>"'Will you tell me?' I answered. 'I might help.'</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps I will some day,' she said, quietly. 'But you can't help; no one
  can do that. It was my fault all through, and the only thing that matters now
  is that Giles should never know.'</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know why she suddenly confided in me, even to that extent.
  I suppose with her woman's intuition she realised that I'd guessed something,
  and it helps to get a thing off one's chest at times. Evidently it had been
  an unexpected meeting, and I cursed myself for having made him play. And yet
  how could one have foretold? It was just a continuation of the jigsaw started
  by that damned bit of orange peel. As she said, all that mattered was that
  Giles &mdash; dear old chap! &mdash; should never know.</p>

  <p>The Soldier smiled a little sadly. "So do the humans propose; but the God
  that moves the pieces frequently has different ideas. He did &mdash; that
  very afternoon. It was just as I was going that two white-faced nurses
  clutching two scared children appeared on the scene and babbled incoherently.
  And then the General's groom hove in sight &mdash; badly cut across the face
  and shaky at the knees &mdash; and from him we got the story.</p>

  <p>"They'd started off in the General's dogcart to go to some children's
  party, and something had frightened the horse, which had promptly bolted. I
  knew the brute &mdash; a great raking black, though the groom, who was a
  first-class whip, generally had no difficulty in managing him. But on this
  occasion apparently he'd got clean away along the road into the town. He
  might have got the horse under control after a time, when, to his horror, he
  saw that the gates were closed at the railway crossing in front. And it was
  at that moment that a man &mdash; one of the sergeants from the barracks
  &mdash; had dashed out suddenly from the pavement and got to the horse's
  head. He was trampled on badly, but he hung on &mdash; and the horse had
  ceased to bolt when they crashed into the gates. The shafts were smashed, but
  nothing more. And the horse wasn't hurt. And they'd carried away the sergeant
  on an improvised stretcher. No; he hadn't spoken. He was un-conscious.</p>

  <p>"'Which sergeant was it?' I asked, quietly &mdash; though I knew the
  answer before the groom gave it.</p>

  <p>"'Sergeant Trevor, sir,' he said. 'B squadron.'</p>

  <p>"'Is he &mdash; is he badly hurt?' said the girl, and her face was
  ashen.</p>

  <p>"'I dunno, mum,' answered the groom. 'They took 'im off to the 'orspital,
  and I was busy with the 'orse.'</p>

  <p>"'I'll ring up, if I may, General,' I said, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I spoke to Purvis, the RAMC fellow, and his voice was very grave. They'd
  brought Trevor in still unconscious, and, though he wouldn't swear to it at
  the moment, he was afraid his back was broken. But he couldn't tell
  absolutely for certain until he came to. I hung up the receiver and found Mrs
  Giles standing behind me. She said nothing &mdash; but just waited for me to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"'Purvis doesn't know for certain,' I said, taking both her hands in mine.
  'But there's a possibility, my dear, that his back is broken.'</p>

  <p>"She was a thoroughbred, that girl. She didn't make a fuss or cry out; she
  just looked me straight in the face and nodded her head once or twice.</p>

  <p>"'I must go to him, of course,' she said, gravely. 'Will you arrange it
  for me, please?'</p>

  <p>"'He's unconscious still,' I told her.</p>

  <p>"'Then I must be beside him when he comes to,' she answered. 'Even if
  there was nothing else &mdash; he's saved my baby's life.'</p>

  <p>"'I'll take you in my car,' I said, when I saw that she was absolutely
  determined. 'Leave it all to me.'</p>

  <p>"'I must see him alone, Dog-face.' She paused by the door, with her
  handkerchief rolled into a tight little ball in her hand. 'I want to know
  that he's forgiven me.'</p>

  <p>"'You shall see him alone if it's humanly possible,' I answered gravely,
  and at that she was gone.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know how I did it, but somehow or other I got her away from
  the General's house without Giles knowing. Giles junior was quite unhurt, and
  disposed to regard the entire thing as an entertainment got up especially for
  his benefit. And when she'd made sure of that, and kissed him passionately to
  his intense disgust, she slipped away with me in the car.</p>

  <p>"'You mustn't be disappointed,' I warned her as we drove along, 'if you
  can't see him alone. He may have been put into a ward with other men.'</p>

  <p>"'Then they must put some screens round him,' she whispered. 'I must kiss
  him before &mdash; before&mdash;' She didn't complete the sentence; but it
  wasn't necessary.</p>

  <p>"We didn't speak again until I turned in at the gates of the hospital. And
  then I asked her a question which had been on the tip of my tongue a dozen
  times.</p>

  <p>"'Who is he &mdash; really?'</p>

  <p>"'Jimmy Dallas is his name,' she answered, quietly. 'We were engaged. And
  then his father lost all his money. He thought that was why &mdash; why I was
  beastly to him &mdash; but oh! Dog-face, it wasn't at all. I thought he was
  fond of another girl &mdash; and it was all a mistake. I found it out too
  late. And then Jimmy had disappeared &mdash; and I'd married Giles. Up at
  that cricket match was the first time I'd seen him since my wedding.'</p>

  <p>"We drew up at the door, and I got out. It's the little tragedies, the
  little misunderstandings, that are so pitiful, and in all conscience this was
  a case in point. A boy and a girl &mdash; each too proud to explain, or ask
  for an explanation; and now the big tragedy. God! it seemed so futile.</p>

  <p>"I left her sitting in the car, and went in search of Purvis. I found him
  with Trevor &mdash; I still thought of him under that name &mdash; and he was
  conscious again. The doctor looked up as I tiptoed in, and shook his head at
  me warningly. So I waited, and after a while Purvis left the bed and drew me
  out into the passage.</p>

  <p>"'I'm not sure,' he said. 'He's so infernally bruised and messed about.
  His left arm is broken in two places, and three ribs &mdash; and I'm afraid
  his back as well. He seems so numb. But I can't be certain.'</p>

  <p>"'Mrs Yeverley is here,' I said. 'The mother of one of the kids he saved.
  She wants to see him.'</p>

  <p>"'Out of the question,' snapped Purvis. 'I absolutely forbid it.'</p>

  <p>"'But you mustn't forbid it, Doctor.' We both swung round, to see the girl
  herself standing behind us. 'I've got to see him. There are other reasons
  besides his having saved my baby's life.'</p>

  <p>"'They must wait, Mrs Yeverley,' answered the Doctor. 'In a case of this
  sort the only person I would allow to see him would be his wife.'</p>

  <p>"'If I hadn't been a fool,' she said deliberately, 'I should have been his
  wife,' and Purvis' jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Without another word she swept past him into the ward, and Purvis stood
  there gasping.</p>

  <p>"'Well, I'm damned!' he muttered, and I couldn't help smiling. It was
  rather a startling statement to come from a woman stopping with the GOC about
  a sergeant in a cavalry regiment.</p>

  <p>"And then, quite suddenly and unexpectedly, came the final turn in the
  wheel. I was strolling up and down outside with Purvis, who was a sahib as
  well as a Doctor and had asked no questions.</p>

  <p>"'If his back is broken it can't hurt him,' he had remarked, 'and if it
  isn't it will do him good.'</p>

  <p>"At that we had left it, when suddenly, to my horror, I saw Giles himself
  going into the hospital.</p>

  <p>"'Good Lord, Doc!' I cried, sprinting after him, 'that's her husband. And
  he doesn't know she's here.'</p>

  <p>"But a lot can happen in a few seconds, and I was just a few seconds too
  late. As I got to the door I saw Giles in front of me &mdash; standing at the
  entrance to the ward as if he had been turned to stone. A big screen hid the
  bed from sight &mdash; but a screen is not soundproof. He looked at me as I
  came up, and involuntarily I stopped as I saw his face. And then quite
  clearly from the room beyond came his wife's voice.</p>

  <p>"'My darling, darling boy! &mdash; it's you and only you for ever and
  ever!'</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know how much Giles had guessed before. I think he knew
  about her previous engagement, but I'm quite sure he had never associated
  Trevor with it. A year or two later she told me that when she married him she
  had made no attempt to conceal the fact that she had loved another man
  &mdash; and loved him still.</p>

  <p>"And Giles had taken her on those terms. But at the time I didn't know
  that: I only knew that a very dear friend's world had crashed about his head
  with stunning suddenness. It was Giles who pulled himself together first
  &mdash; Giles, with a face grey and lined, who said in a loud voice to me:
  'Well, Dog-face, where is the invalid?'</p>

  <p>"And then he waited a moment or two before he went round the screen.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! my dear,' he said, quite steadily, as he saw his wife, 'you
  here?'</p>

  <p>"He played his part for ten minutes, stiff-lipped and without a falter;
  then he went, and his wife went with him to continue the play in which they
  were billed for life. Trevor's back was not broken &mdash; in a couple of
  months he was back at duty. And so it might have continued for the duration,
  but for Giles being drowned fishing in Ireland."</p>

  <p>The Soldier stared thoughtfully at the fire.</p>

  <p>"He was a first-class fisherman and a wonderful swimmer, was Giles
  Yeverley, and sometimes &mdash; I wonder. They say he got caught in a bore
  &mdash; that perhaps he got cramp. But, as I say, sometimes &mdash; I
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"I saw them &mdash; Jimmy Dallas, sometime Sergeant Trevor, and his wife
  &mdash; at the Ritz two nights ago. They seemed wonderfully in love, though
  they'd been married ten years, and I stopped by their table.</p>

  <p>"'Sit down, Dog-face,' she ordered, 'and have a liqueur.'</p>

  <p>"So I sat down and had a liqueur. And it was just as I was going that she
  looked at me with her wonderful smile, and said, very softly: 'Thank God!
  dear old Giles never knew; and now, if he does, he'll understand.'"</p>

  <p>The Soldier got up and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"A big result for a bit of yellow peel."</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6">VI. &mdash; THE WRITER'S STORY,<br>
  BEING THE HOUSE AT APPLEDORE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I'm not certain, strictly speaking, that my story can be
said to concern
  my trade," began the Writer, after he had seen his guests were comfortable.
  "But it happened &mdash; this little adventure of mine &mdash; as the direct
  result of pursuing my trade, so I will interpret the rule accordingly.</p>

  <p>"My starting point is the Largest Pumpkin Ever Produced in Kent. It was
  the sort of pumpkin which gets a photograph all to itself in the illustrated
  papers &mdash; the type of atrocity which is utterly useless to any human
  being. And yet that large and unpleasant vegetable proved the starting point
  of the most exciting episode in my somewhat prosaic life. In fact, but for
  very distinct luck, that pumpkin would have been responsible for my equally
  prosaic funeral." The Writer smiled reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"It was years ago, in the days before a misguided public began to read my
  books and supply me with the necessary wherewithal to keep the wolf from the
  door. But I was young and full of hope, and Fleet Street seemed a very
  wonderful place. From which you can infer that I was a journalist, and
  candour compels me to admit &mdash; a jolly bad one. Not that I realised it
  at the time. I regarded my editor's complete lack of appreciation of my
  merits as being his misfortune, not my fault. However, I pottered around,
  doing odd jobs and having the felicity of seeing my carefully penned
  masterpieces completely obscured by blue pencil and reduced to two lines.</p>

  <p>"Then one morning I was sent for to the inner sanctuary. Now, although I
  had the very lowest opinion of the editor's abilities, I knew sufficient of
  the office routine to realise that such a summons was unlikely to herald a
  rise of screw with parchment certificate of appreciation for services
  rendered. It was far more likely to herald the order of the boot &mdash; and
  the prospect was not very rosy. Even in those days Fleet Street was full of
  unemployed journalists who knew more than their editors.</p>

  <p>"The news editor was in the office when I walked in, and he was a kindly
  man, was old Andrews. He looked at me from under his great bushy eyebrows for
  a few moments without speaking; then he pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"'Graham,' he remarked in a deep bass voice, 'are you aware that this
  paper has never yet possessed a man on its staff that writes such unutterable
  slush as you do?'</p>

  <p>"I remained discreetly silent; to dissent seemed tactless, to agree,
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"'What do you propose to do about it?' he continued after a while.</p>

  <p>"I told him that I hadn't realised I was as bad as all that, but that I
  would do my best to improve my style and give satisfaction in the future.</p>

  <p>"'It's not so much your style,' he conceded. 'Years ago I knew a man whose
  style was worse. Only a little &mdash; but it was worse. But it's your nose
  for news, my boy &mdash; that's the worst thing that ever came into Fleet
  Street. Now, what were you doing yesterday?'</p>

  <p>"'I was reporting that wedding at the Brompton Oratory, sir,' I told
  him.</p>

  <p>"'Just so,' he answered. 'And are you aware that in a back street not
  three hundred yards from the church a man died through eating a surfeit of
  winkles, as the result of a bet? Actually while you were there did that man
  die by the winkle-barrow &mdash; and you knew nothing about it. I'm not
  denying that your report on the wedding isn't fair &mdash; but the public is
  entitled to know about the dangers of winkle-eating to excess. Not that the
  rights of the public matter in the least, but it's the principle I want to
  impress on you &mdash; the necessity of keeping your eyes open for other
  things beside the actual job you're on. That's what makes the good
  journalist.'</p>

  <p>I assured him that I would do so in future, and he grunted non-
  committally. Then he began rummaging in a drawer, while I waited in
  trepidation.</p>

  <p>"'We'll give you a bit longer, Graham,' he announced at length, and I
  breathed freely again. 'But if there is no improve-ment you'll have to go.
  And in the meantime I've got a job for you this afternoon. Some
  public-spirited benefactor has inaugurated an agricultural fête in Kent,
  somewhere near Ashford. From what I can gather, he seems partially wanting in
  intelligence, but it takes people all ways. He is giving prizes for the
  heaviest potato and the largest egg &mdash; though I am unable to see what
  the hen's activity has to do with her owner. And I want you to go down and
  write it up. Half a column. Get your details right. I believe there is a
  treatise on soils and manures in the office somewhere. And put in a paragraph
  about the paramount importance of the Englishman getting back to the land.
  Not that it will have any effect, but it might help to clear Fleet
  Street.'</p>

  <p>"He was already engrossed in something else, and dismissed me with a wave
  of his hand. And it was just as I got to the door that he called after me to
  send Cresswill to him &mdash; Cresswill, the star of all the special men. His
  reception, I reflected a little bitterly as I went in search of him, would be
  somewhat different from mine. For he had got to the top of the tree, and was
  on a really big job at the time. He did all the criminal work &mdash; murder
  trials and so forth, and how we youngsters envied him! Perhaps, in time, one
  might reach those dazzling heights, I reflected, as I sat in my third-class
  carriage on the way to Ashford. Not for him mammoth tubers and double-yolkers
  &mdash; but the things that really counted.</p>

  <p>"I got out at Ashford, where I had to change. My destination was
  Appledore, and the connection on was crowded with people obviously bound,
  like myself, for the agricultural fête. It was a part of Kent to which I had
  never been, and when I got out at Appledore station I found I was in the flat
  Romney Marsh country which stretches inland from Dungeness. Houses are few
  and far between, except in the actual villages themselves &mdash; the whole
  stretch of land, of course, must once have been below sea level &mdash; and
  the actual fête was being held in a large field on the outskirts of
  Appledore. It was about a mile from the station, and I proceeded to walk.</p>

  <p>"The day was warm, the road was dusty &mdash; and I, I am bound to admit,
  was bored. I felt I was destined for better things than reporting on bucolic
  flower shows, much though I loved flowers. But I like them in their proper
  place, growing &mdash; not arranged for show in a stuffy tent and surrounded
  by perspiring humanity. And so when I came to the gates of a biggish house
  and saw behind them a garden which was a perfect riot of colour,
  involuntarily I paused and looked over.</p>

  <p>"The house itself stood back about a hundred yards from the road &mdash; a
  charming old place covered with creepers, and the garden was lovely. A little
  neglected, perhaps &mdash; I could see a respectable number of weeds in a bed
  of irises close to the drive &mdash; but then it was quite a large garden.
  Probably belonged to some family that could not afford a big staff, I
  reflected, and that moment I saw a man staring at me from between some shrubs
  a few yards away.</p>

  <p>"There was no reason why he shouldn't stare at me &mdash; he was inside
  the gate and presumably had more right to the garden than I had &mdash; but
  there was something about him that made me return the stare, in silence, for
  a few moments. Whether it was his silent approach over the grass and
  unexpected appearance, or whether it was that instinctively he struck me as
  an incongruous type of individual to find in such a sleepy locality, I can't
  say. Or, perhaps, it was a sudden lightning impression of hostile suspicion
  on his part, as if he resented anyone daring to look over his gate.</p>

  <p>"Then he came towards me, and I felt I had to say something. But even as I
  spoke the thought flashed across my mind that he would have appeared far more
  at home in a London bar than in a rambling Appledore garden.</p>

  <p>"'I was admiring your flowers,' I said as he came up. 'Your irises are
  wonderful.'</p>

  <p>"He looked vaguely at some lupins, then his intent gaze came back to
  me.</p>

  <p>"'The garden is well known locally,' he remarked. 'Are you a member of
  these parts?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' I answered, 'I come from London,' and it seemed to me his gaze grew
  more intent.</p>

  <p>"'I am only a bird of passage, too,' he said easily. 'Are you just down
  for the day?'</p>

  <p>"I informed him that I had come down to write up the local fête; being
  young and foolish, I rather think I implied that only the earnest request of
  the organiser for me in particular had persuaded the editor to dispense with
  my invaluable services even for a few hours. And all the time his eyes, black
  and inscrutable, never left my face.</p>

  <p>"'The show is being held in a field about a quarter of a mile farther on,'
  he said when I had finished. 'Good morning.'</p>

  <p>"He turned abruptly on his heels and walked slowly away towards the house,
  leaving me a little annoyed, and with a feeling that not only had I been
  snubbed, but, worse still, had been seen through. I felt that I had failed to
  convince him that editors tore their hair and bit their nails when they
  failed to secure my services; I felt, indeed, just that particular type of
  ass that one does feel when one has boasted vaingloriously, and been listened
  to with faintly amused boredom. I know that as I resumed my walk towards the
  agricultural fête I endeavoured to restore my self-respect by remembering
  that he was merely a glorified yokel, who probably knew no better."</p>

  <p>The Writer leant back in his chair with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"That awful show still lives in my memory," he continued after a while.
  "There were swing boats, and one of those ghastly shows where horses go round
  and round with a seasick motion and 'The Blue Bells of Scotland' emerges
  without cessation from the bowels of the machine.</p>

  <p>There were coconut shies and people peering through horse-collars to have
  their photographs taken, and over everything an all-pervading aroma of
  humanity unsuitably clad in its Sunday best on a warm day. However, the job
  had to be done, so I bravely plunged into the marquees devoted to the
  competing vegetables. I listened to the experts talking around me with the
  idea of getting the correct local colour, but as most of their remarks were
  incomprehensible, I soon gave that up as a bad job and began looking about
  me.</p>

  <p>"There were potatoes and carrots and a lot of things which I may have
  eaten, but completely failed to recognise in a raw state. And then suddenly,
  through a gap in the asparagus, I saw a vast yellowy-green object. It seemed
  about four times the size of an ordinary Rugby football, and a steady stream
  of people circled slowly round it and an ancient man, who periodically
  groomed it with a vast coloured handkerchief. So I steered a zigzag course
  between a watery-eyed duck on my right and a hand-holding couple on my left,
  and joined the stream. At close quarters it seemed even vaster than when
  viewed from the other side of the tent, and after I'd made the grand tour
  twice, I thought I'd engage the ancient man in conversation. Unfortunately,
  he was stone deaf, and his speech was a little indistinct owing to a
  regrettable absence of teeth, so we managed between us to rivet the
  fascinated attention of every human being in the tent. In return for the
  information that it was the largest pumpkin ever produced in Kent, I
  volunteered that I had come from London specially to write about it. He
  seemed a bit hazy about London, but when I told him it was larger than
  Appledore he appeared fairly satisfied that his pumpkin would obtain
  justice.</p>

  <p>"He also launched into a voluble discourse, which was robbed of much of
  its usefulness by his habit of holding his false teeth in position with his
  thumb as he spoke. Luckily a local interpreter was at hand, and from him I
  gathered that the old man was eighty-five, and had never been farther afield
  than Ashford, forty-eight years ago. Also that he was still gardener at
  Cedarlime, a house which I must have passed on my way from the station.
  Standing well back it was: fine flower gardens &mdash; 'but not what they
  was. Not since the new gentleman come &mdash; a year ago. Didn't take the
  same interest&mdash;not him. A scholard, they said 'e was; crates and crates
  of books had come to the house &mdash; things that 'eavy that they took three
  and four men to lift them.'</p>

  <p>"He rambled on did that interpreter, while the ancient man polished the
  pumpkin in the time-honoured manner, and wheezed spasmodically. But I wasn't
  paying much attention, because it had suddenly come back to me that Cedarlime
  was the name of the house where I had spoken to the inscrutable stranger.
  Subconsciously I had noticed it as I crossed the road; now it was brought
  back to my memory.</p>

  <p>"'Is the owner of Cedarlime a youngish man?' I asked my informant. 'Dark
  hair; rather sallow face?'</p>

  <p>"He shook his head. The owner of Cedarlime was a middle-aged man with grey
  hair, but he often had friends stopping with him who came from London, so
  he'd heard tell &mdash; friends who didn't stop long &mdash; just for the
  weekend, maybe, or four or five days. Probably the man I meant was one of
  these friends.</p>

  <p>"My informant passed on to inspect a red and hairy gooseberry, and I
  wandered slowly out of the stuffy tent. Probably a friend &mdash; in fact,
  undoubtedly a friend. But try as I would to concentrate on that confounded
  flower show, my thoughts kept harking back to Cedarlime. For some reason or
  other, that quiet house and the man who had come so silently out of the
  bushes had raised my curiosity. And at that moment I narrowly escaped death
  from a swing boat, which brought me back to the business in hand.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was about three hours later that I started to stroll back to
  the station. I was aiming at a five o'clock train, and intended to write my
  stuff on the way up to Town. But just as I was getting to the gates of the
  house that interested me, who should I see in front of me but the venerable
  pumpkin polisher. He turned as I got abreast of him and recognised me with a
  throaty chuckle. And he promptly started to talk. I gathered that he had many
  other priceless treasures in his garden &mdash; wonderful sweet peas, more
  pumpkins of colossal dimensions. And after a while I further gathered that he
  was suggesting I should go in and examine them for myself.</p>

  <p>"For a moment I hesitated. I looked at my watch &mdash; there was plenty
  of time. Then I looked over the gates and made up my mind. I would introduce
  this ancient being into my account of the fête; write up, in his own setting,
  this extraordinary old man who had never left Appledore for forty-eight
  years. And, in addition, I would have a closer look at the house possibly
  even see the scholarly owner.</p>

  <p>"I glanced curiously round as I followed him up the drive. We went about
  halfway to the house, then turned off along a path into the kitchen garden.
  And finally he came to rest in front of the pumpkins &mdash; he was obviously
  a pumpkin maniac. I should think he conducted a monologue for five minutes on
  the habits of pumpkins while I looked about me. Occasionally I said 'Yes';
  occasionally I nodded my head portentously; for the rest of the time I paid
  no attention.</p>

  <p>"I could see half the front and one side of the house &mdash; but there
  seemed no trace of any occupants. And I was just going to ask the old man who
  lived there, when I saw a man in his shirt-sleeves standing at one of the
  windows. He was not the man who had spoken to me at the gate; he was not a
  grey-headed man either, so presumably not the owner. He appeared to be
  engrossed in something he was holding in his hands, and after a while he held
  it up to the light in the same way one holds up a photographic plate. It was
  then that he saw me.</p>

  <p>"Now, I have never been an imaginative person, but there was something
  positively uncanny in the way that man disappeared. Literally in a flash he
  had gone and the window was empty. And my imagination began to stir. Why had
  that man vanished so instantaneously at the sight of a stranger in the
  kitchen garden?</p>

  <p>"And then another thing began to strike me. Something which had been
  happening a moment or two before had abruptly stopped &mdash; a noise, faint
  and droning, but so steady that I hadn't noticed it until it ceased. It had
  been the sort of noise which, if you heard it today, you would say was caused
  by an aeroplane a great way off &mdash; and quite suddenly it had stopped. A
  second or two after the man had seen me and vanished from the window, that
  faint droning noise had ceased. I was sure of it, and my imagination began to
  stir still more.</p>

  <p>"However, by this time my venerable guide had exhausted pumpkins, and,
  muttering strange words, he began to lead me towards another part of the
  garden. It was sweet peas this time, and I must say they were really
  magnificent. In fact, I had forgotten the disappearing gentleman at the
  window in my genuine admiration of the flowers, when I suddenly saw the old
  man straighten himself up, take a firm grip of his false teeth with his one
  hand and touch his cap with the other. He was looking over my shoulder, and I
  swung round.</p>

  <p>"Three men were standing behind me on the path. One was the man I had
  spoken to that morning; one was the man I had seen at the window; the other
  was grey-haired, and, I assumed, the owner of the house. It was to him I
  addressed myself.</p>

  <p>"'I must apologise for trespassing,' I began, 'but I am reporting the
  agricultural fête down here, and your gardener asked me in to see your sweet
  peas. They are really magnificent specimens.'</p>

  <p>"The elderly man stared at me in silence.</p>

  <p>"'I don't quite see what the sweet peas in my garden have to do with the
  fête,' he remarked coldly. 'And it is not generally customary, when the owner
  is at home, to wander round his garden at the invitation of his
  gardener.'</p>

  <p>"'Then I can only apologise and withdraw at once,' I answered stiffly. 'I
  trust that I have not irreparably damaged your paths.'</p>

  <p>"He frowned angrily and seemed on the point of saying something, when the
  man I had spoken to at the gate took his arm and whispered something in his
  ear. I don't know what it was he said, but it had the effect of restoring the
  grey-haired man to a better temper at once.</p>

  <p>"'I must apologise,' he said affably, 'for my brusqueness. I am a recluse,
  Mr &mdash; ah &mdash; Mr&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Graham is my name,' I answered, partially mollified.</p>

  <p>"He bowed. 'A recluse, Mr Graham &mdash; and my garden is a hobby of mine.
  That and my books. I fear I may have seemed a little irritable when I first
  spoke, but I have a special system of my own for growing sweet peas, and I
  guard it jealously. I confess that for a moment I was unjust and suspicious
  enough to think you might be trying to pump information from my
  gardener.'</p>

  <p>"I looked at old Methuselah, still clutching his false teeth, and smiled
  involuntarily. The elderly man guessed my thoughts and smiled, too.</p>

  <p>"'I am apt to forget that it takes several months to interpret old Jake,'
  he continued. 'Those false teeth of his fascinate one, don't they? I shall
  never forget the dreadful occasion he dropped them in the hotbed. We had the
  most agonising search, and finally persistence triumphed. They were rescued
  unscathed and restored to their rightful place.'</p>

  <p>"And so he went on talking easily, until half-unconsciously I found myself
  strolling with him towards the house. Every now and then he stopped to point
  out some specimen of which he was proud, and, without my realising it, twenty
  minutes or so slipped by. It was the sound of a whistle at the station that
  recalled me to the passage of time, and I hurriedly looked at my watch.</p>

  <p>"'Good Heavens!' I cried, 'I've missed my train. When is the next?'</p>

  <p>"'The next, Mr Graham. I'm afraid there isn't a next till tomorrow
  morning. This is a branch line, you know.'</p>

  <p>"Jove! how I swore inwardly. After what old Andrews had said to me only
  that morning, to go and fail again would finally cook my goose. You must
  remember that it was before the days of motorcars, and, with the fête in
  progress, the chance of getting a cart to drive me some twelve miles to
  Ashford was remote &mdash; anyway for the fare I could afford to pay.</p>

  <p>"I suppose my agitation showed on my face, for the grey-haired man became
  quite upset.</p>

  <p>"'How stupid of me not to have thought of the time,' he cried. 'We must
  think of the best thing to do. I know,' he said suddenly &mdash; 'you must
  telegraph your report. Stop the night here and telegraph.'</p>

  <p>"I pointed out to him rather miserably that newspapers did not like the
  expense of wiring news unless it was important, and that by no stretch of
  imagination could the Appledore Flower Show be regarded as coming under that
  category.</p>

  <p>"'I will pay the cost,' he insisted, and waved aside my refusal. 'Mr
  Graham,' he said, 'it was my fault. I am a wealthy man; I would not dream of
  letting you suffer for my verbosity. You will wire your article, and I shall
  pay.'"</p>

  <p>The Writer smiled reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"What could have been more charming," he continued &mdash; "what more
  considerate and courteous? My stupid, half-formed suspicions, which had been
  growing fainter and fainter as I strolled round the garden with my host, had
  by this time vanished completely, and when he found me pens, ink, and paper,
  as they say in the French exercise book, I stammered out my thanks. He cut me
  short with a smile, and told me to get on with my article. He would send it
  to the telegraph office, and tell his servants to get a room ready for me.
  And with another smile he left me alone, and I saw him pottering about the
  garden outside as I wrote.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it has ever happened to any of you fellows" &mdash;
  the Writer lit a cigarette &mdash; "to harbour suspicions which are gradually
  lulled, only to have them suddenly return with redoubled force. There was I,
  peacefully writing my account of the Appledore fête, while outside my host,
  an enthusiastic gardener, as he had told me, pursued his hobby. Could
  anything have been more commonplace and matter of fact? He was engaged on the
  roses at the moment, spraying them with some solution, presumably for green
  fly, and unconsciously I watched him. No, I reflected, it couldn't be for
  green fly, because he was only spraying the roots, and even I, though not an
  expert, knew that green fly occur round the buds. And at that moment I caught
  a momentary glimpse of the two other men. They were roaring with laughter,
  and it seemed to me that my host was the cause of the merriment. He looked up
  and saw them, and the hilarity ceased abruptly. The next moment they had
  disappeared, and my host was continuing the spraying. He went on
  industriously for a few minutes, then he crossed the lawn towards the open
  window of the room where I was writing.</p>

  <p>"'Nearly finished?' he asked.</p>

  <p>"'Very nearly,' I answered. 'Green fly bad this year?'</p>

  <p>"'Green fly?' he said a little vaguely. 'Oh! so-so.'</p>

  <p>"'I thought you must be tackling them on the roses,' I pursued.</p>

  <p>"'Er, quite &mdash; quite,' he remarked. 'Nasty things, aren't they?'</p>

  <p>"'Is it a special system of yours to go for the roots?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"He gave me one searching look, then he laughed mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"'Ah, ha! my young friend,' he answered. 'Don't you try and get my stable
  secrets out of me.'</p>

  <p>"And I felt he was lying. Without thinking something made me draw a bow at
  a venture, and the arrow went home with a vengeance.</p>

  <p>"'Wonderful delphiniums you've got,' I remarked, leaning out of the window
  and pointing to a bed underneath.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he said. 'I'm very proud of those.'</p>

  <p>"And the flowers at which I was pointing were irises. So this enthusiastic
  gardener did not know the difference between a delphinium and an iris. Back
  in an overwhelming wave came all my suspicions; I knew there was a mystery
  somewhere. This man wasn't a gardener; and, if not, why this pretence? I
  remember now that every time he had drawn my attention to a specimen he had
  taken the attached label in his hand. Quite unobtrusive it had been,
  unnoticeable at the time, now it suddenly became significant. Why was he
  playing this part &mdash; pretending for my benefit? Futilely spraying the
  roots of roses, making me miss my train. I was convinced now that that had
  been part of the plan &mdash; but why? Why the telegraphing? Why the
  invitation to stop the night?</p>

  <p>"The old brain was working pretty quickly by this time. No one, whatever
  his business, would object to a <i>bona fide</i> journalist writing an
  account of a fête, and if the business were crooked, the people engaged on it
  would be the first to speed that journalist on his way. People of that type
  dislike journalists only one degree less than the police. Then why &mdash;
  why? The answer simply stuck out &mdash; they suspected me of not being a
  journalist, or, even if they did not go as far as that, they were taking no
  chances on the matter.</p>

  <p>"In fact, I was by this time definitely convinced in my own mind that I
  had quite unwittingly stumbled into a bunch of criminals, and it struck me
  that the sooner I stumbled out again the better for my health. So I put my
  article in my pocket and went to the door. I would wire it off, and I would
  not return.</p>

  <p>"The first hitch occurred at the door, which had thoughtfully been locked.
  Not being a hero of fiction, I confess it gave me a nasty shock &mdash; that
  unyielding door. And as I stood there taking a pull at myself I heard the
  grey-haired man's voice outside the window: "'Finished yet, Mr Graham?'</p>

  <p>"I walked across the room, and in as steady a voice as I could muster I
  mentioned the fact that the door was locked.</p>

  <p>"'So that you shouldn't be disturbed, Mr Graham' &mdash; and I thought of
  the Wolf in 'Red Riding Hood,' with his satisfactory answers to all awkward
  questions.</p>

  <p>"'If someone would open it, I'll get along to the telegraph office,' I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"'I wouldn't dream of your going to so much trouble,' he said suavely.
  'I've a lazy boy I employ in the garden; he'll take it.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment I hesitated, and a glint came into his eyes, which warned me
  to be careful.</p>

  <p>"It was then that I had my brainstorm. If I hadn't had it I shouldn't be
  here now; if the powers that be in the newspaper world were not the quickest
  people on the uptake you can meet in a day's march, I shouldn't be here now
  either. But like a flash of light there came to my mind the story I had once
  been told of how a war correspondent in the South African War, at a time when
  they were tightening the censorship, got back full news of a battle by
  alluding to the rise and fall of certain stock. And the editor in England
  read between the lines &mdash; substituted troops for stocks, Canadians for
  CPR, and so on &mdash; and published the only account of the battle.</p>

  <p>"Could I do the same? I hesitated.</p>

  <p>"'Oh! there's one thing I've forgotten,' I remarked. 'I'll just add it if
  the boy can wait.'</p>

  <p>"So I sat down at the table, and to my report I added the following
  sentences: "'There was also some excellent mustard and cress. Will come at
  once, but fear tomorrow morning may be too late for me to be of further use
  over Ronaldshay affair.'</p>

  <p>"And then I handed it to the grey-haired man through the window."</p>

  <p>The Writer leant back in his chair, and the Soldier stared at him,
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit too cryptic for me," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! it wasn't too cryptic for the office," said the Writer. "There
  was no Ronaldshay affair, so I knew that would draw their attention. And
  perhaps you've forgotten the name of our star reporter, who dealt in criminal
  matters. It was Cresswill. And if you write the word cress with a capital C
  and leave out the full stop after it, you'll see the message I got through to
  the office."</p>

  <p>"It's uncommon lucky for you his name wasn't Snooks," remarked the Actor
  with a grin. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we had dinner, and I can only suppose that my attempts to appear at
  ease had failed to convince my companions.</p>

  <p>"The last thing I remember that night was drinking a cup of coffee &mdash;
  the old trick &mdash; and suddenly realising it was drugged. I staggered to
  my feet, while they remained sitting round the table watching me. Then, with
  a final glimpse of the grey-haired man's face, I passed into oblivion.</p>

  <p>"When I came to I was in a strange room, feeling infernally sick. And I
  shall never forget my wild relief when the man by the window turned round and
  I saw it was Cresswill himself. He came over to the bed and smiled down at
  me.</p>

  <p>"'Well done, youngster,' he said, and a glow of pride temporarily replaced
  my desire for a basin. 'Well done, indeed. We've got the whole gang, and
  we've been looking for 'em for months. They were banknote forgers on a big
  scale, but we were only just in time to save you.'</p>

  <p>"'How was that' I asked weakly.</p>

  <p>"'I think they had decided that your sphere of usefulness was over,' he
  remarked with a grin. 'So after having removed suspicion by telegraphing your
  report, they gave you a very good dinner, when, as has been known to happen
  with young men before, you got very drunk.'</p>

  <p>"'I was drugged,' I said indignantly.</p>

  <p>"'The point is immaterial,' he answered quietly. 'Drunk or drugged, it's
  much the same after you've been run over by a train. And we found two of them
  carrying you along a lane towards the line at half-past eleven. The down
  goods to Hastings passes at twenty to twelve.'</p>

  <p>"And at that moment Providence was kind. I ceased to <i>feel</i> sick. I
  was."</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7">VII. &mdash; THE OLD DINING ROOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I don't pretend to account for it; I am merely giving the
plain
  unvarnished tale of what took place to my certain knowledge at Jack Drage's
  house in Kent during the weekend which finished so disastrously. Doubtless
  there is an explanation: maybe there are several. The believers in
  spiritualism and things psychic will probably say that the tragedy was due to
  the action of a powerful influence which had remained intact throughout the
  centuries; the materialists will probably say it was due to indigestion. I
  hold no brief for either side: as the mere narrator, the facts are good
  enough for me. And, anyway, the extremists of both schools of thought are
  quite irreconcilable.</p>

  <p>There were six of us there, counting Jack Drage and his wife. Bill Sibton
  in the Indian Civil, Armytage in the Gunners, and I &mdash; Staunton by name,
  and a scribbler of sorts &mdash; were the men: little Joan Neilson &mdash;
  Armytage's fiancée &mdash; supported Phyllis Drage. Ostensibly we were there
  to shoot a few pheasants, but it was more than a mere shooting party. It was
  a reunion after long years of us four men who had been known at school as the
  Inseparables. Bill had been in India for twelve years, save for the
  inevitable gap in Mesopotamia; Dick Armytage had soldiered all over the place
  ever since he'd left the Shop. And though I'd seen Jack off and on since our
  school days, I'd lost touch with him since he'd married. Wives play the deuce
  with bachelor friends though they indignantly deny it &mdash; God bless 'em.
  At least, mine always does.</p>

  <p>It was the first time any of us had been inside Jack's house, and
  undoubtedly he had the most delightful little property. The house itself was
  old, but comfortably modernised by an expert, so that the charm of it still
  remained. In fact, the only room which had been left absolutely intact was
  the dining room. And to have touched that would have been sheer vandalism.
  The sole thing that had been done to it was to install central heating, and
  that had been carried out so skilfully that no trace of the work could be
  seen.</p>

  <p>It was a room by itself, standing apart from the rest of the house, with a
  lofty vaulted roof in which one could just see the smoky old oak beams by the
  light of the candles on the dinner table. A huge open fireplace jutted out
  from one of the longer walls; while on the opposite side a door led into the
  garden. And then, at one end, approached by the original staircase at least
  six centuries old, was the musicians' gallery.</p>

  <p>A wonderful room &mdash; a room in which it seemed almost sacrilege to eat
  and smoke and discuss present-day affairs &mdash; a room in which one felt
  that history had been made. Nothing softened the severe plainness of the
  walls save a few medieval pikes and battleaxes. In fact, two old muskets of
  the Waterloo era were the most modern implements of the collection. Of
  pictures there was only one &mdash; a very fine painting of a man dressed in
  the fashion of the Tudor period &mdash; which hung facing the musicians'
  gallery.</p>

  <p>It was that that caught my eye as we sat down to dinner, and I turned to
  Jack.</p>

  <p>"An early Drage?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact &mdash; no relation at all," he answered. "But a
  strong relation to this room. That's why I hang him there."</p>

  <p>"Any story attached thereto?"</p>

  <p>"There is; though I can't really do it justice. The parson here is the
  only man who knows the whole yarn. By the way, old dear," he spoke to his
  wife across the table, "the reverend bird takes tea with us tomorrow. But he
  is the only man who has the thing at his fingertips. The previous owner was a
  bit vague himself, but having a sense of the fitness of things, he gave me a
  chance of buying the picture. Apparently it's a painting of one Sir James
  Wrothley who lived round about the time of Henry VIII. He was either a rabid
  Protestant or a rabid Roman Catholic &mdash; I told you I was a bit vague
  over details &mdash; and he used this identical room as a secret meeting
  place for himself and his pals to hatch plots against his enemies."</p>

  <p>"Jack <i>is</i> so illuminating, isn't he?" laughed his wife.</p>

  <p>"Well, I bet you can't tell it any better yourself," he retorted with a
  grin. "I admit my history is weak. But anyway, about that time, if the jolly
  old Protestants weren't burning the RCs, the RCs were burning the
  Protestants. A period calling for great tact, I've always thought. Well, at
  any rate, this Sir James Wrothley &mdash; when his party was being officially
  burned &mdash; came here and hatched dark schemes to reverse the procedure.
  And then, apparently, one day somebody blew the gaff, and the whole bunch of
  conspirators in here were absolutely caught in the act by the other crowd,
  who put 'em all to death on the spot. Which is all I can tell you about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I must ask the padre tomorrow," I said to his wife. "I'd rather like to
  hear the whole story. I felt when I first came into this room there was
  history connected with it."</p>

  <p>She looked at me rather strangely for a moment; then she gave a little
  forced laugh.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Tom," she said slowly, "at times I almost hate this room.
  All my friends gnash their teeth with envy over it &mdash; but sometimes,
  when Jack's been away, and I've dined in here by myself &mdash; it's
  terrified me. I feel as if &mdash; I wasn't alone: as if &mdash; there were
  people all round me &mdash; watching me. Of course, it's absurd, I know. But
  I can't help it. And yet I'm not a nervy sort of person."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's at all absurd," I assured her. "I believe I should
  feel the same myself. A room of this size, which, of necessity, is dimly
  lighted in the corners, and which is full of historical associations, must
  cause an impression on the least imaginative person."</p>

  <p>"We used it once for a dance," she laughed; "with a ragtime band in the
  gallery."</p>

  <p>"And a great show it was, too," broke in her husband. "The trouble was
  that one of the musicians got gay with a bottle of whisky, and very nearly
  fell clean through that balustrade effect on to the floor below. I haven't
  had that touched &mdash; and the wood is rotten."</p>

  <p>"I pray you be seated, gentlemen." A sudden silence fell on the table, and
  everybody stared at Bill Sibton.</p>

  <p>"Is it a game, Bill?" asked Jack Drage. "I rather thought we were. And
  what about the ladies?"</p>

  <p>With a puzzled frown Bill Sibton looked at him. "Did I speak out loud,
  then?" he asked slowly."</p>

  <p>"And so early in the evening too!" Joan Neilson laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"I must have been day-dreaming, I suppose. But that yarn of yours has
  rather got me, Jack; though in the course of a long and evil career I've
  never heard one told worse. I was thinking of that meeting &mdash; all of
  them sitting here. And then suddenly that door bursting open." He was staring
  fixedly at the door, and again a silence fell on us all.</p>

  <p>"The thunder of the butts of their muskets on the woodwork." He swung
  round and faced the door leading to the garden. "And on that one, too. Can't
  you hear them? No escape &mdash; none. Caught like rats in a trap." His voice
  died away to a whisper, and Joan Neilson gave a little nervous laugh.</p>

  <p>"You're the most realistic person, Mr Sibton. I think I prefer hearing
  about the dance."</p>

  <p>I glanced at my hostess &mdash; and it seemed to me that there was fear in
  her eyes as she looked at Bill. Sometimes now I wonder if she had some vague
  premonition of impending disaster: something too intangible to take hold of
  &mdash; something the more terrifying on that very account.</p>

  <p>It was after dinner that Jack Drage switched on the solitary electric
  light of which the room boasted. It was so placed as to show up the painting
  of Sir James Wrothley, and in silence we all gathered round to look at it. A
  pair of piercing eyes set in a stern aquiline face stared down at us from
  under the brim of a hat adorned with sweeping plumes; his hand rested on the
  jewelled hilt of his sword. It was a fine picture in a splendid state of
  preservation, well worthy of its place of honour on the walls of such a room,
  and we joined in a general chorus of admiration. Only Bill Sibton was silent,
  and he seemed fascinated &mdash; unable to tear his eyes away from the
  painting.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, Bill," said Dick Armytage, studying the portrait
  critically, "he might well be an ancestor of yours. Wash out your moustache,
  and give you a fancy-dress hat, and you'd look very much like the old
  bean."</p>

  <p>He was quite right: there was a distinct resemblance, and it rather
  surprised me that I had not noticed it myself. There were the same deep-set
  piercing eyes, the same strong, slightly hatchet face, the same broad
  forehead. Even the colouring was similar: a mere coincidence that, probably
  &mdash; but one which increased the likeness. In fact, the longer I looked
  the more pronounced did the resemblance become, till it was almost
  uncanny.</p>

  <p>"Well, he can't be, anyway," said Bill abruptly. "I've never heard of any
  Wrothley in the family." He looked away from the picture almost with an
  effort and lit a cigarette. "It's a most extraordinary thing, Jack," he went
  on after a moment, "but ever since we came into this room I've had a feeling
  that I've been here before."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, man, that's common enough in all conscience. One often gets
  that idea."</p>

  <p>"I know one does," answered Bill. "I've had it before myself; but never
  one-tenth as strongly as I feel it here. Besides, that feeling generally dies
  &mdash; after a few minutes: it's growing stronger and stronger with me every
  moment I stop in here."</p>

  <p>"Then let's go into the drawing room," said our hostess. "I've had the
  card table put in there."</p>

  <p>We followed her and Joan Neilson into the main part of the house; and
  since neither of the ladies played, for the next two hours we four men
  bridged. And then, seeing that it was a special occasion, we sat yarning over
  half-forgotten incidents till the room grew thick with smoke and the two
  women fled to bed before they died of asphyxiation.</p>

  <p>Bill, I remember, waxed eloquent on the subject of politicians, with a six
  weeks' experience of India, butting in on things they knew less than nothing
  about; Dick Armytage grew melancholy on the subject of the block in
  promotion. And then the reminiscences grew more personal, and the whisky sank
  lower and lower in the tantalus as one yarn succeeded another.</p>

  <p>At last Jack Drage rose with a yawn and knocked the ashes out of his
  pipe.</p>

  <p>"Two o'clock, boys. What about bed?"</p>

  <p>"Lord! is it really?" Dick Armytage stretched himself. "However, no
  shooting tomorrow, or, rather, today. We might spend the Sabbath dressing
  Bill up as his nibs in the next room."</p>

  <p>A shadow crossed Bill's face.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten that room," he said, frowning. "Damn you, Dick!"</p>

  <p>"My dear old boy," laughed Armytage, "you surely don't mind resembling the
  worthy Sir James! He's a deuced sight better-looking fellow than you
  are."</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head irritably.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that at all," he said. "I wasn't thinking of the picture." He
  seemed to be on the point of saying something else &mdash; then he changed
  his mind. "Well &mdash; bed for master."</p>

  <p>We all trooped upstairs, and Jack came round to each of us to see that we
  were all right.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast provisionally nine," he remarked. "Night-night, old boy."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him, and his steps died away down the passage as he
  went to his own room.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>By all known rules I should have been asleep almost as my head touched the
  pillow. A day's rough shooting, followed by bed at two in the morning should
  produce that result if anything can, but in my case that night it didn't.
  Whether I had smoked too much, or what it was, I know not, but at half-past
  three I gave up the attempt and switched on my light. Then I went over, and
  pulling up an armchair, I sat down by the open window. There was no moon, and
  the night was warm for the time of year. Outlined against the sky the big
  dining room stretched out from the house, and, as I lit a cigarette, Jack
  Drage's vague story returned to my mind. The conspirators, meeting by stealth
  to hatch some sinister plot; the sudden alarm as they found themselves
  surrounded; the desperate fight against over-whelming odds &mdash; and then,
  the end. There should be a story in it, I reflected; I'd get the parson to
  tell me the whole thing accurately next day. The local colour seemed more
  appropriate when one looked at the room from the outside, with an occasional
  cloud scudding by over the big trees beyond. Savoured more of conspiracy and
  death than when dining inside, with reminiscences of a jazz band in the
  musicians' gallery.</p>

  <p>And at that moment a dim light suddenly filtered out through the windows.
  It was so dim that at first I thought I had imagined it; so dim that I
  switched off my own light in order to make sure. There was no doubt about it:
  faint but unmistakable the reflection showed up on the ground outside. A
  light had been lit in the old dining room: therefore someone must be in
  there. At four o'clock in the morning!</p>

  <p>For a moment or two I hesitated: should I go along and rouse Jack? Someone
  might have got in through the garden door, and I failed to see why I should
  fight another man's burglar in his own house. And then it struck me it would
  only alarm his wife &mdash; I'd get Bill, whose room was opposite mine.</p>

  <p>I put on some slippers and crossed the landing to rouse him. And then I
  stopped abruptly. His door was open; his room was empty. Surely it couldn't
  be he who had turned on the light below?</p>

  <p>As noiselessly as possible I went downstairs, and turned along the passage
  to the dining room. Sure enough the door into the main part of the house was
  ajar, and the light was shining through the opening. I tiptoed up to it and
  looked through the crack by the hinges.</p>

  <p>At first I could see nothing save the solitary electric light over the
  portrait of Sir James. And then in the gloom beyond I saw a tall figure
  standing motionless by the old oak dining table. It was Bill &mdash; even in
  the dim light I recognised that clean-cut profile; Bill clad in his pyjamas
  only, with one hand stretched out in front of him, pointing. And then,
  suddenly, he spoke.</p>

  <p>"You lie, Sir Henry! &mdash; you lie!</p>

  <p>Nothing more &mdash; just that one remark; his hand still pointing
  inexorably across the table. Then after a moment he turned so that the light
  fell full on his face, and I realised what was the matter. Bill Sibton was
  walking in his sleep.</p>

  <p>Slowly he came towards the door behind which I stood, and passed through
  it &mdash; so close that he almost touched me as I shrank back against the
  wall. Then he went up the stairs, and as soon as I heard him reach the
  landing above, I quickly turned out the light in the dining room and followed
  him. His bedroom door was closed: there was no sound from inside.</p>

  <p>There was nothing more for me to do: my burglar had developed into a
  harmless somnambulist. Moreover, it suddenly struck me that I had become most
  infernally sleepy myself. So I did not curse Bill mentally as much as I might
  have done. I turned in, and my nine o'clock next morning was very
  provisional.</p>

  <p>So was Bill Sibton's: we arrived together for breakfast at a quarter to
  ten. He looked haggard and ill, like a man who has not slept, and his first
  remark was to curse Dick Armytage.</p>

  <p>"I had the most infernal dreams last night," he grumbled. "Entirely
  through Dick reminding me of this room. I dreamed the whole show that took
  place in here in that old bird's time."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the portrait of Sir James.</p>

  <p>"Did you?" I remarked, pouring out some coffee. "Must have been quite
  interesting."</p>

  <p>"I know I wasn't at all popular with the crowd," he said. "I don't set any
  store by dreams myself &mdash; but last night it was really extraordinarily
  vivid." He stirred his tea thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I can quite imagine that, Bill. Do you ever walk in your sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Walk in my sleep? No." He stared at me surprised. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"You did last night. I found you down here at four o'clock in your
  pyjamas. You were standing just where I'm sitting now, pointing with your
  hand across the table. And as I stood outside the door you suddenly said,
  'You lie, Sir Henry! &mdash; you lie!' "</p>

  <p>"Part of my dream," he muttered. "Sir Henry Brayton was the name of the
  man &mdash; and he was the leader. They were all furious with me about
  something. We quarrelled &mdash; and after that there seemed to be a closed
  door. It was opening slowly, and instinctively I knew there was something
  dreadful behind it. You know the terror of a dream; the primordial terror of
  the mind that cannot reason against something hideous &mdash; unknown&mdash;"
  I glanced at him: his forehead was wet with sweat. "And then the dream
  passed. The door didn't open."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly, my lad," I remarked lightly, "you had one whisky too many
  last night."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass, Tom," he said irritably. "I tell you &mdash; though you
  needn't repeat it &mdash; I'm in a putrid funk of this room. Absurd, I know:
  ridiculous. But I can't help it. And if there was a train on this branch line
  on Sunday, I'd leave today."</p>

  <p>"But, good Lord, Bill," I began &mdash; and then I went on with my
  breakfast. There was a look on his face which it is not good to see on the
  face of a man. It was terror: an abject, dreadful terror.</p>

  <p align="center">II</p>

  <p>He and Jack Drage were out for a long walk when the parson came to tea
  that afternoon &mdash; a walk of which Bill had been the instigator. He had
  dragged Jack forth, vigorously protesting, after lunch, and we had cheered
  them on their way. Bill had to get out of the house &mdash; I could see that.
  Then Dick and the girl had disappeared, in the way that people in their
  condition <i>do</i> disappear, just before Mr Williams arrived. And so only
  Phyllis Drage was there, presiding at the tea table, when I broached the
  subject of the history of the dining room.</p>

  <p>"He spoils paper, Mr Williams," laughed my hostess, "and he scents copy.
  Jack tried to tell the story last night, and got it hopelessly wrong."</p>

  <p>The clergyman smiled gravely.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to alter the setting, Mr Staunton," he remarked, "because the
  story is quite well known round here. In my library at the vicarage I have an
  old manuscript copy of the legend. And indeed, I have no reason to believe
  that it is a legend: certainly the main points have been historically
  authenticated. Sir James Wrothley, whose portrait hangs in the dining room,
  lived in this house. He was a staunch Protestant &mdash; bigoted to a degree;
  and he fell very foul of Cardinal Wolsey, who you may remember was plotting
  for the Papacy at the time. So bitter did the animosity become, and so high
  did religious intolerance run in those days, that Sir James started counter-
  plotting against the Cardinal; which was a dangerous thing to do. Moreover,
  he and his friends used the dining room here as their meeting place."</p>

  <p>The reverend gentleman sipped his tea; if there was one thing he loved it
  was the telling of this story, which reflected so magnificently on the
  staunch no-Popery record of his parish.</p>

  <p>"So much is historical certainty; the rest is not so indisputably
  authentic. The times of the meetings were, of course, kept secret &mdash;
  until the fatal night occurred. Then, apparently, someone turned traitor.
  And, why I cannot tell you, Sir James himself was accused by the others
  &mdash; especially Sir Henry Brayton. Did you say anything, Mr Staunton?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," I remarked quietly. "The name surprised me for a moment. Please
  go on."</p>

  <p>"Sir Henry Brayton was Sir James' next-door neighbour, almost equally
  intolerant of anything savouring of Rome. And even while, so the story goes,
  Wolsey's men were hammering on the doors, he and Sir Henry had this dreadful
  quarrel. Why Sir James should have been suspected, whether the suspicions
  were justified or not I cannot say. Certainly, in view of what we know of Sir
  James' character, it seems hard to believe that he could have been guilty of
  such infamous treachery. But that the case must have appeared exceedingly
  black against him is certain from the last and most tragic part of the
  story."</p>

  <p>Once again Mr Williams paused to sip his tea; he had now reached that
  point of the narrative where royalty itself would have failed to hurry
  him.</p>

  <p>"In those days, Mrs Drage, there was a door leading into the musicians'
  gallery from one of the rooms of the house. It provided no avenue of escape
  if the house was surrounded &mdash; but its existence was unknown to the men
  before whose blows the other doors were already beginning to splinter. And
  suddenly through this door appeared Lady Wrothley. She had only recently
  married Sir James: in fact, her first baby was then on its way. Sir James saw
  her, and at once ceased his quarrel with Sir Henry. With dignity he mounted
  the stairs and approached his girl-wife &mdash; and in her horror-struck eyes
  he saw that she, too, suspected him of being the traitor. He raised her hand
  to his lips; and then as the doors burst open simultaneously and Wolsey's men
  rushed in &mdash; he dived headforemost on to the floor below, breaking his
  neck and dying instantly.</p>

  <p>"The story goes on to say," continued Mr Williams, with a diffident cough,
  "that even while the butchery began in the room below &mdash; for most of the
  Protestants were unarmed &mdash; the poor girl collapsed in the gallery, and
  shortly afterwards the child was born. A girl baby, who survived, though the
  mother died. One likes to think that if she had indeed misjudged her husband,
  it was a merciful act on the part of the Almighty to let her join him so
  soon. Thank you, I will have another cup of tea. One lump, please."</p>

  <p>"A most fascinating story, Mr Williams," said Phyllis. "Thank you so much
  for having told us. Can you make anything out of it, Tom?"</p>

  <p>I laughed.</p>

  <p>"The criminal reserves his defence. But it's most interesting, Padre, most
  interesting, as Mrs Drage says. If I may, I'd like to come and see that
  manuscript."</p>

  <p>"I shall be only too delighted," he murmured with old-fashioned courtesy.
  "Whenever you like."</p>

  <p>And then the conversation turned on things parochial until he rose to go.
  The others had still not returned, and for a while we two sat on talking as
  the spirit moved us in the darkening room. At last the servants appeared to
  draw the curtains, and it was then that we heard Jack and Bill in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>I don't know what made me make the remark; it seemed to come without my
  volition.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, Phyllis," I said, "I don't think I'd tell the story of the
  dining room to Bill."</p>

  <p>She looked at me curiously.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know &mdash; but I wouldn't." In the brightly lit room his fears
  of the morning seemed ridiculous; yet, as I say, I don't know what made me
  make the remark.</p>

  <p>"All right; I won't," she said gravely. "Do you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But further conversation was cut short by the entrance of Bill and her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Twelve mile if an inch," growled Drage, throwing himself into a chair.
  "You awful fellow."</p>

  <p>Sibton laughed.</p>

  <p>"Do you good, you lazy devil. He's getting too fat, Phyllis, isn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>I glanced at him as he, too, sat down: in his eyes there remained no trace
  of the terror of the morning.</p>

  <p align="center">III</p>

  <p>And now I come to that part of my story which I find most difficult to
  write. From the story-teller's point of view pure and simple, it is the
  easiest; from the human point of view I have never tackled anything harder.
  Because, though the events I am describing took place months ago &mdash; and
  the first shock is long since past &mdash; I still cannot rid myself of a
  feeling that I was largely to blame. By the cold light of reason I can
  exonerate myself; but one does not habitually have one's being in that
  exalted atmosphere. Jack blames himself; but in view of what happened the
  night before &mdash; in view of the look in Bill's eyes that Sunday morning
  &mdash; I feel that I ought to have realised that there were influences at
  work which lay beyond my ken &mdash; influences which at present lie not
  within the light of reason. And then at other times I wonder if it was not
  just a strange coincidence and an &mdash; accident. God knows: frankly, I
  don't.</p>

  <p>We spent that evening just as we had spent the preceding one, save that in
  view of shooting on Monday morning we went to bed at midnight. This time I
  fell asleep at once &mdash; only to be roused by someone shaking my arm. I
  sat up blinking: it was Jack Drage.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, Tom," he whispered. "There's a light in the dining room, and
  we're going down to investigate. Dick is getting Bill."</p>

  <p>In an instant I was out of bed.</p>

  <p>"It's probably Bill himself," I said. "I found him down there last night
  walking in his sleep."</p>

  <p>"The devil you did!" muttered Jack, and at that moment Dick Armytage came
  in.</p>

  <p>"Bill's room is empty," he announced; and I nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's Bill right enough," I said. "He went back quite quietly last night.
  And, for Heaven's sake, you fellows, don't wake him. It's very
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>Just as before the dining room door was open, and the light filtered
  through into the passage as we tiptoed along it. Just as before we saw Bill
  standing by the table &mdash; his hand outstretched.</p>

  <p>Then came the same words as I had heard last night.</p>

  <p>"You lie, Sir Henry! &mdash; you lie!"</p>

  <p>"What the devil&mdash;" muttered Jack; but I held up my finger to ensure
  silence.</p>

  <p>"He'll come to bed now," I whispered. "Keep quite still."</p>

  <p>But this time Bill Sibton did not come to bed; instead, he turned and
  stared into the shadows of the musicians' gallery. Then, very slowly, he
  walked away from us and commenced to mount the stairs. And still the danger
  did not strike us.</p>

  <p>Dimly we saw the tall figure reach the top and walk along the gallery, as
  if he saw someone at the end &mdash; and at that moment the peril came to the
  three of us.</p>

  <p>To Dick and Jack the rottenness of the balustrade; to me &mdash; <i>the
  end of the vicar's story</i>. What they thought I know not; but to my dying
  day I shall never forget my own agony of mind. In that corner of the
  musicians' gallery &mdash; though we could see her not &mdash; stood Lady
  Wrothley; to the man walking slowly towards her the door was opening slowly
  &mdash; the door which had remained shut the night before &mdash; the door
  behind which lay the terror.</p>

  <p>And then it all happened very quickly. In a frenzy we raced across the
  room to get at him &mdash; but we weren't in time. There was a rending of
  wood &mdash; a dreadful crash &mdash; a sprawling figure on the floor below.
  To me it seemed as if he had hurled himself against the balustrade, had
  literally dived downwards. The others did not notice it &mdash; so they told
  me later. But I did.</p>

  <p>And then we were kneeling beside him on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Dear God!" I heard Drage say in a hoarse whisper. "He's dead; he's broken
  his neck."</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Such is my story. Jack Drage blames himself for the rottenness of the
  woodwork, but I feel it was my fault. Yes &mdash; it was my fault. I ought to
  have known, ought to have done something. Even if we'd only locked the dining
  room door.</p>

  <p>And the last link in the chain I haven't mentioned yet. The vicar supplied
  that &mdash; though to him it was merely a strange coincidence.</p>

  <p>The baby girl &mdash; born in the gallery &mdash; a strange, imaginative
  child, so run the archives, subject to fits of awful depression and, at other
  times, hallucinations &mdash; married. She married in 1551, on the 30th day
  of October, Henry, only son of Frank Sibton and Mary his wife.</p>

  <p>God knows: I don't. It may have been an accident.</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8">VIII. &mdash; WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"But, Bill, I don't understand. How much did you borrow
from this
  man?"</p>

  <p>Sybil Daventry looked at her brother, sitting huddled up in his chair,
  with a little frown.</p>

  <p>"I borrowed a thousand," he answered, sulkily. "And like a fool I didn't
  read the thing he made me sign &mdash; at least, not carefully. Hang it, I've
  only had the money six months, and now he's saying that I owe him over two. I
  saw something about twenty-five per cent, and now I find it was twenty-five
  per cent a month. And the swine is pressing for payment unless&mdash;" He
  broke off and stared into the fire shamefacedly.</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" demanded his sister.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, it's this way." The boy stammered a little, and refused to
  look at her. "I was jolly well up the spout when this blighter told me what I
  owed him, and I suppose I must have showed it pretty clearly. Anyway, I was
  propping up the bar at the Cri, getting a cocktail, when a fellow standing
  next me started gassing. Not a bad sort of cove at all; knows you very well
  by sight."</p>

  <p>"Knows me?" said the girl, bewildered. "Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that later," went on her brother. "Well, we had a couple
  more and then he suggested tearing a chop together. And I don't know &mdash;
  he seemed so decent and all that &mdash; that I told him I was in the soup.
  Told him the whole yarn and asked his advice sort of business. Well, as I
  say, he was bally sporting about it all, and finally asked me who the bird
  was who had tied up the boodle. I told him, and here's the lucky part of the
  whole show &mdash; this fellow Perrison knew him. Perrison was the man I was
  lunching with."</p>

  <p>He paused and lit a cigarette, while the girl stared at him gravely.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said at length, "go on."</p>

  <p>"It was after lunch that he got busy. He said to me: 'Look here, Daventry,
  you've made a bally fool of yourself, but you're not the first. I'll write a
  note to Messrs Smith and Co' &mdash; those are the warriors who gave me the
  money &mdash; 'and try and persuade them to give you more time, or even
  possibly reduce the rate of interest.' Of course, I was all on this, and I
  arranged to lunch with him again next day, after Smith and Co had had time to
  function. And sure enough they did. Wrote a letter in which they were all
  over me; any friend of Mr Perrison's was entitled to special treatment, and
  so on and so forth. Naturally I was as bucked as a dog with two tails, and
  asked Perrison if I couldn't do something more material than just thank him.
  And &mdash; er &mdash; he &mdash; I mean it was then he told me he knew you
  by sight."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his sister, and then quickly looked away again.</p>

  <p>"He suggested &mdash; er &mdash; that perhaps I could arrange to introduce
  him to you; that it would be an honour he would greatly appreciate, and all
  that sort of rot."</p>

  <p>The girl was sitting very still. "Yes," she said, quietly, "and you
  &mdash; agreed."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course I did. Hang it, he's quite a decent fellow. Bit Cityish
  to look at, and I shouldn't think he knows which end of a horse goes first.
  But he's got me out of the devil of a hole, Sybil, and the least you can do
  is to be moderately decent to the bird. I mean it's not asking much, is it? I
  left the governor looking at him in the hall as if he was just going to tread
  on his face, and that long slab &mdash; your pal &mdash; is gazing at him
  through his eyeglasses as if he was mad."</p>

  <p>"He's not my pal, Bill." Sybil Daventry's colour heightened a little.</p>

  <p>"Well, you asked him here, anyway," grunted the boy. Then with a sudden
  change of tone he turned to her appealingly. "Syb, old girl &mdash; for the
  Lord's sake play the game. You know what the governor is, and if he hears
  about this show &mdash; especially as it's &mdash; as it's not the first time
  &mdash; there'll be the deuce to pay. You know he said last time that if it
  happened again he'd turn me out of the house. And the old man is as stubborn
  as a mule. I only want you to be a bit decent to Perrison."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a grave smile. "If Mr Perrison is satisfied with my
  being decent to him, as you put it, I'm perfectly prepared to play the game.
  But&mdash;" She frowned and rose abruptly. "Come on, and I'll have a look at
  him."</p>

  <p>In silence they went downstairs. Tea had just been brought in, and the
  house party was slowly drifting into the hall. But Sybil barely noticed them;
  her eyes were fixed on the man talking to her father. Or rather, at the
  moment, her father was talking to the man, and his remark was painfully
  audible.</p>

  <p>"There is a very good train back to London at seven-thirty, Mr &mdash; ah
  &mdash; Mr&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her brother stepped forward. "But I say, Dad," he said, nervously, "I
  asked Perrison to stop the night. I've just asked Sybil, and she says she can
  fix him up somewhere."</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr Perrison?" With a charming smile she held out her hand.
  "Of course you must stop the night."</p>

  <p>Then she moved away to the tea table, feeling agreeably relieved; it was
  better than she had expected. The man was well-dressed; perhaps, to her
  critical eye, a little too well-dressed &mdash; but still quite
  presentable.</p>

  <p>"You averted a catastrophe, Miss Daventry." A lazy voice beside her
  interrupted her thoughts, and with a smile she turned to the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Dad is most pestilentially rude at times, isn't he? And Bill told me he
  left <i>you</i> staring at the poor man as if he was an insect."</p>

  <p>Archie Longworth laughed.</p>

  <p>"He'd just contradicted your father flatly as you came downstairs. And on
  a matter concerning horses. However &mdash; the breeze has passed. But, tell
  me," he stared at her gravely, "why the sudden invasion?"</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows went up a little. "May I ask why not?" she said, coldly.
  "Surely my brother can invite a friend to the house if he wishes."</p>

  <p>"I stand corrected," answered Longworth, quietly. "Has he known him
  long?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't an idea," said the girl. "And after all, Mr Longworth, I hadn't
  known you very long when I asked you."</p>

  <p>And then, because she realised that there was a possibility of construing
  rather more into her words than she had intended, she turned abruptly to
  speak to another guest. So she failed to see the sudden inscrutable look that
  came into Archie Longworth's keen blue eyes &mdash; the quick clenching of
  his powerful fists. But when a few minutes later she again turned to him, he
  was just his usual lazy self.</p>

  <p>"Do you think your logic is very good?" he demanded. "You might have made
  a mistake as well."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you think my brother has?" she said, quickly.</p>

  <p>"It is visible on the surface to the expert eye," he returned, gravely.
  "But, in addition, I happen to have inside information."</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mr Perrison, then?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes, I have &mdash; er &mdash; met him before."</p>

  <p>"But he doesn't know you," cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"No &mdash; at least &mdash; er &mdash; we'll leave it at that. And I
  would be obliged, Miss Daventry, in case you happen to be speaking to him, if
  you would refrain from mentioning the fact that I know him." He stared at her
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"You're very mysterious, Mr Longworth," said the girl, with an attempt at
  lightness.</p>

  <p>"And if I may I will prolong my visit until our friend departs," continued
  Longworth.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," she said, bending over the tea tray. "You weren't
  thinking of going &mdash; going yet, were you?"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking after lunch that I should have to go tomorrow," he said,
  putting down his teacup.</p>

  <p>"But why so soon?" she asked, and her voice was low. "Aren't you enjoying
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"In the course of a life that has taken me into every corner of the
  globe," he answered, slowly, "I have never dreamed that I could be so utterly
  and perfectly happy as I have been here. It has opened my mind to a vista of
  the Things that Might Be &mdash; if the Things that Had Been were different.
  But as you grow older, Sybil, you will learn one bitter truth: no human being
  can ever be exactly what he seems. Masks? just masks! And underneath &mdash;
  God and that being alone know."</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly, and she watched him bending over Lady Granton with his
  habitual lazy grace. The indolent smile was round his lips &mdash; the
  irrepressible twinkle was in his eyes. But for the first time he had called
  her Sybil; for the first time &mdash; she <i>knew</i>. The vague forebodings
  conjured up by his words were swamped by that one outstanding fact; she
  <i>knew</i>. And nothing else mattered.</p>

  <p align="center">II</p>

  <p>It was not until Perrison joined her in the conservatory after dinner that
  she found herself called on to play the part set her by her brother.</p>

  <p>She had gone there &mdash; though nothing would have induced her to admit
  the fact &mdash; in the hope that someone else would follow: the man with the
  lazy blue eyes and the eyeglass. And then instead of him had come Perrison,
  with a shade too much deference in his manner, and a shade too little control
  of the smirk on his face. With a sudden sick feeling she realised at that
  moment exactly where she stood. Under a debt of obligation to this man
  &mdash; under the necessity of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with him, one, moreover,
  when, if she was to help Bill, she must endeavour to be extra nice.</p>

  <p>For a while the conversation was commonplace, while she feverishly longed
  for someone to come in and relieve the tension. But Bridge was in progress,
  and there was Snooker in the billiard room, and at length she resigned
  herself to the inevitable. Presumably she would have to thank him for his
  kindness to Bill; after all he undoubtedly had been very good to her
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Bill has told me, Mr Perrison, how kind you've been in the way you've
  helped him in this &mdash; this unfortunate affair." She plunged valiantly,
  and gave a sigh of relief as she cleared the first fence.</p>

  <p>Perrison waved a deprecating hand. "Don't mention it, Miss Daventry, don't
  mention it. But &mdash; er &mdash; of course, something will have to be done,
  and &mdash; well, there's no good mincing matters &mdash; done very
  soon."</p>

  <p>The girl's face grew a little white, but her voice was quite steady.</p>

  <p>"But he told me that you had arranged things with these people. Please
  smoke, if you want to."</p>

  <p>Perrison bowed his thanks and carefully selected a cigarette. The moment
  for which he had been playing had now arrived, in circumstances even more
  favourable than he had dared to hope.</p>

  <p>"Up to a point that is quite true," he remarked, quietly. "Messrs Smith
  and Co have many ramifications of business &mdash; money-lending being only
  one of the irons they have in the fire. And because I have had many dealings
  with the firm professionally &mdash; over the sale of precious stones, I may
  say, which is my own particular line of work &mdash; they were disposed to
  take a lenient view about the question of the loan. Not press for payment,
  and perhaps &mdash; though I can't promise this &mdash; even be content with
  a little less interest. But &mdash; er &mdash; Miss Daventry, it's the other
  thing where the trouble is going to occur."</p>

  <p>The girl stared at him with dilated eyes. "What other thing, Mr
  Perrison?"</p>

  <p>"Hasn't your brother told you?" said Perrison, surprised. "Oh, well,
  perhaps I &mdash; er &mdash; shouldn't have mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please." Her voice was low. "What is this other thing?"</p>

  <p>For a moment he hesitated &mdash; a well-simulated hesitation. Then he
  shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"Well &mdash; if you insist. As a matter of fact, your brother didn't tell
  me about it, and I only found it out in the course of my conversation with
  one of the Smith partners. Apparently some weeks ago he bought some
  distinctly valuable jewellery &mdash; a pearl necklace, to be exact from a
  certain firm. At least, when I say he bought it &mdash; he did not pay for
  it. He gave your father's name as a reference, and the firm considered it
  satisfactory. It was worth about eight hundred pounds, this necklace, and
  your very stupid brother, instead of giving it to the lady whom, presumably,
  he had got it for, became worse than stupid. He became criminal."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The girl was looking at him terrified.</p>

  <p>"He pawned this necklace which he hadn't paid for, Miss Daventry, which
  is, I regret to say, a criminal offence. And the trouble of the situation is
  that the firm he bought the pearls from has just found it out. He pawned it
  at a place which is one of the ramifications of Smith and Co, who gave him, I
  believe, a very good price for it &mdash; over five hundred pounds. The firm,
  in the course of business, two or three days ago &mdash; and this is the
  incredibly unfortunate part of it &mdash; happened to show this self-same
  necklace, while they were selling other things, to the man it had originally
  come from. Of course, being pawned, it wasn't for sale &mdash; but the man
  recognised it at once. And then the fat was in the fire."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," whispered the girl, "that &mdash; that they might
  send him to prison?"</p>

  <p>"Unless something is done very quickly, Miss Daventry, the matter will
  certainly come into the law courts. Messrs Gross and Sons" &mdash; a faint
  noise from the darkness at the end of the conservatory made him swing round
  suddenly, but everything was silent again &mdash; "Messrs Gross and Sons are
  very difficult people in many ways. They are the people it came from
  originally, I may tell you. And firms, somewhat naturally, differ, like human
  beings. Some are disposed to be lenient &mdash; others are not. I'm sorry to
  say Gross and Sons are one of those who are not."</p>

  <p>"But couldn't you see them, or something, and explain?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Daventry," said Perrison, gently, "I must ask you to be
  reasonable. What can I explain? Your brother wanted money, and he adopted a
  criminal method of getting it. That I am afraid &mdash; ugly as it sounds
  &mdash; is all there is to it."</p>

  <p>"Then, Mr Perrison &mdash; can nothing be done?" She bent forward eagerly,
  her hands clasped, her lips slightly parted; and once again came that faint
  noise from the end of the conservatory.</p>

  <p>But Mr Perrison was too engrossed to heed it this time; the nearness, the
  appeal of this girl, who from the time he had first seen her six months
  previously at a theatre had dominated his life, was making his senses swim.
  And with it the veneer began to drop; the hairy heel began to show, though he
  made a tremendous endeavour to keep himself in check.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing," he said, hoarsely. "And I hope you will understand
  that I should not have been so precipitate &mdash; except for the urgency of
  your brother's case. If I go to Messrs Gross and say to them that a
  prosecution by them would affect me personally, I think I could persuade them
  to take no further steps."</p>

  <p>Wonder was beginning to dawn in the girl's eyes. "Affect you personally?"
  she repeated.</p>

  <p>"If, for instance, I could tell them that for family reasons &mdash;
  urgent, strong family reasons &mdash; they would be doing me a great service
  by letting matters drop, I think they would do it."</p>

  <p>She rose suddenly &mdash; wonder replaced by horror. She had just realised
  his full meaning.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about, Mr Perrison?" she said,
  haughtily.</p>

  <p>And then the heel appeared in all its hairiness. "If I may tell them," he
  leered, "that I am going to marry into the family I'll guarantee they will do
  nothing more."</p>

  <p>"Marry you?" The biting scorn in her tone changed the leer to a snarl.</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; marry me, or see your brother jugged. Money won't save him
  &mdash; so there's no good going to your father. Money will square up the
  Smith show &mdash; it won't square the other." And then his tone changed.
  "Why not, little girl? I'm mad about you; have been ever since I saw you at a
  theatre six months ago. I'm pretty well off even for these days, and&mdash;"
  He came towards her, his arms outstretched, while she backed away from him,
  white as a sheet. Her hands were clenched, and it was just as she had
  retreated as far as she could, and the man was almost on her, that she saw
  red. One hand went up; hit him &mdash; hit the brute &mdash; was her only
  coherent thought. And the man, realising it, paused &mdash; an ugly look in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then occurred the interruption. A strangled snort, as of a sleeper
  awakening, came from behind some palms, followed by the creaking of a chair.
  With a stifled curse Perrison fell back and the girl's hand dropped to her
  side as the branches parted and Archie Longworth, rubbing his eyes, stepped
  into the light.</p>

  <p>"Lord save us, Miss Daventry, I've been asleep," he said, stifling a yawn.
  "I knew I oughtn't to have had a third glass of port. Deuced bad for the
  liver, but very pleasant for all that, isn't it, Mr &mdash; Mr Perrison?"</p>

  <p>He smiled engagingly at the scowling Perrison, and adjusted his
  eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"You sleep very silently, Mr Longworth," snarled that worthy.</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; used to win prizes for it at an infant school. Most valuable
  asset in class. If one snores it disconcerts the lecturer."</p>

  <p>Perrison swung round on his heel. "I would like an answer to my suggestion
  by tomorrow, Miss Daventry," he said, softly. "Perhaps I might have the
  pleasure of a walk where people don't sleep off the effects of dinner."</p>

  <p>With a slight bow he left the conservatory, and the girl sat down
  weakly.</p>

  <p>"Pleasant type of bird, isn't he?" drawled Longworth, watching Perrison's
  retreating back.</p>

  <p>"He's a brute &mdash; an utter brute," whispered the girl, shakily.</p>

  <p>"I thought the interview would leave you with that impression," agreed the
  man.</p>

  <p>She sat up quickly. "Did you hear what was said?"</p>

  <p>"Every word. That's why I was there." He smiled at her calmly.</p>

  <p>"Then why didn't you come out sooner?" she cried, indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to hear what he had to say, and at the same time I didn't want
  you to biff him on the jaw &mdash; which from your attitude I gathered you
  were on the point of doing."</p>

  <p>"Why not? I'd have given anything to have smacked his face."</p>

  <p>"I know. I'd have given anything to have seen you do it. But &mdash; not
  yet. In fact, tomorrow you've got to go for a walk with him."</p>

  <p>"I flatly refuse!" cried Sybil Daventry.</p>

  <p>"More than that," continued Longworth, calmly, "you've got to keep him on
  the hook. Play with him; let him think he's got a chance."</p>

  <p>"But why?" she demanded. "I loathe him."</p>

  <p>"Because it is absolutely essential that he should remain here until the
  day after tomorrow at the earliest."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand." She looked at him with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"You will in good time." It seemed to her his voice was just a little
  weary. "Just now it is better that you shouldn't. Do you trust me enough to
  do that, Sybil?"</p>

  <p>"I trust you absolutely," and she saw him wince.</p>

  <p>"Then keep him here till I come back."</p>

  <p>"Are you going away, Archie?" Impulsively she laid her hand on his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, first thing. I shall come back as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two they stood in silence, then, with a gesture strangely
  foreign to one so typically British, he raised her hand to his lips. And the
  next instant she was alone.</p>

  <p>A little later she saw him talking earnestly to her brother in a corner;
  then someone suggested billiard-fives. An admirable game, but not one in
  which it is wise to place one's hand on the edge of the table with the
  fingers over the cushion. Especially if the owner of the hand is not paying
  attention to the game. It was Perrison's hand, and the agony of being hit on
  the fingers by a full-sized billiard ball travelling fast must be experienced
  to be believed. Of course it was an accident: Longworth was most apologetic.
  But in the middle of the hideous scene that followed she caught his lazy blue
  eye and beat a hasty retreat to the hall. Unrestrained mirth in such
  circumstances is not regarded as the essence of tact.</p>

  <p align="center">III</p>

  <p>It was about ten o'clock on the morning of the next day but one that a
  sharp-looking, flashily-dressed individual presented himself at the door of
  Messrs Gross and Sons. He was of the type that may be seen by the score any
  day of the week propping up the Westend bars and discoursing on racing form
  in a hoarse whisper.</p>

  <p>"Mornin'," he remarked. "Mr Johnson here yet?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want to see him about?" demanded the assistant.</p>

  <p>"To tell him that your hair wants cutting," snapped the other. "Hop along,
  young fellah; as an ornament you're a misfit. Tell Mr Johnson that I've a
  message from Mr Perrison."</p>

  <p>The youth faded away, to return in a minute or two with a request that the
  visitor would follow him.</p>

  <p>"Message from Perrison? What's up?" Mr Johnson rose from his chair as the
  door closed behind the assistant.</p>

  <p>The flashy individual laughed and pulled out his cigarette case.</p>

  <p>"He's pulled it off," he chuckled. "At the present moment our one and only
  Joe is clasping the beauteous girl to his bosom."</p>

  <p>"Strike me pink &mdash; he hasn't, has he?" Mr Johnson slapped his leg
  resoundingly and shook with merriment.</p>

  <p>"That's why I've come round," continued the other. "From Smith, I am. Joe
  wants to give her a little present on account." He grinned again, and felt in
  his pocket. "Here it is &mdash; and he wants a receipt signed by you &mdash;
  acknowledging the return of the necklace which was sent out on approval." He
  winked heavily. "He's infernally deep, is Joe." He watched the other man as
  he picked up the pearls, and for a moment his blue eyes seemed a little
  strained. "He wants to give that receipt to the girl &mdash; so as to clinch
  the bargain."</p>

  <p>"Why the dickens didn't he phone me direct?" demanded Johnson, and once
  again the other grinned broadly.</p>

  <p>"Strewth!" he said, "I laughed fit to burst this morning. The phone at his
  girl's place is in the hall, as far as I could make out, and Joe was
  whispering down it like an old woman with lumbago. 'Take 'em round to
  Johnson,' he said. 'Approval &mdash; approval &mdash; you fool.' And then he
  turned away and I heard him say &mdash; 'Good morning, Lady Jemima.' Then
  back he turns and starts whispering again. 'Do you get me, Bob?' 'Yes,' I
  says, 'I get you. You want me to take round the pearls to Johnson and get a
  receipt from him. And what about the other thing &mdash; you know, the money
  the young boob borrowed?' 'Put it in an envelope and send it to me here, with
  the receipt,' he says. 'I'm going out walking this morning.' Then he rings
  off, and that's that. Lord! think of Joe walking."</p>

  <p>The grin developed into a cackling laugh, in which Mr Johnson joined.</p>

  <p>"He's deep &mdash; you're right," he said, admiringly. "Uncommonly deep. I
  never thought he'd pull it off. Though personally, mark you, I think he's a
  fool. They'll fight like cat and dog." He rang a bell on his desk, then
  opening a drawer he dropped the necklace inside.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a formal receipt form," he said to the assistant. "Have you got
  the other paper?" he asked, as he affixed the firm's signature to the
  receipt, and the flashy individual produced it from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he announced. "Put 'em both in an envelope together and
  address it to Joe. I'm going along; I'll post it."</p>

  <p>"Will you have a small tiddley before you go?" Mr Johnson opened a
  formidable-looking safe, disclosing all the necessary-looking ingredients
  for the manufacture of small tiddleys.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind if I do," conceded the other. "Here's the best &mdash; and
  to the future Mrs Joe."</p>

  <p>A moment or two later he passed through the outer office and was swallowed
  up in the crowd. And it was not till after lunch that day that Mr Johnson got
  the shock of his life &mdash; when he opened one of the early evening
  papers.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">&gt;DARING ROBBERY IN WELL-KNOWN CITY FIRM.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"A most daring outrage was carried out last night at the
  office of Messrs Smith and Co, the well-known financial and insurance
  brokers. At a late hour this morning, some time after work was commenced, the
  night watchman was discovered bound and securely gagged in a room at the top
  of the premises. Further investigation revealed that the safe had been opened
  &mdash; evidently by a master hand &mdash; and the contents rifled. The
  extent of the loss is at present unknown, but the police are believed to
  possess several clues."</p><br>

  <p>And at the same time that Mr Johnson was staring with a glassy stare at
  this astounding piece of news, a tall, spare man with lazy blue eyes,
  stretched out comfortably in the corner of a first-class carriage, was also
  perusing it.</p>

  <p>"Several clues," he murmured. "I wonder! But it was a very creditable job,
  though I say it myself."</p>

  <p>Which seemed a strange soliloquy for a well-dressed man in a first-class
  carriage. And what might have seemed almost stranger, had there been any way
  of knowing such a recondite fact, was that in one of the mail bags reposing
  in the back of the train, a mysterious transformation had taken place. For a
  letter which had originally contained two documents and had been addressed to
  J Perrison, Esq, now contained three and was consigned to Miss Sybil
  Daventry. Which merely goes to show how careful one should be over posting
  letters.</p>

  <p align="center">IV</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr Perrison. All well, and taking nourishment, so to
  speak?"</p>

  <p>Archie Longworth lounged into the hall, almost colliding with the other
  man.</p>

  <p>"You look pensive," he continued, staring at him blandly. "<i>Agitato,
  fortissimo</i>. Has aught occurred to disturb your masterly composure?"</p>

  <p>But Mr Perrison was in no mood for fooling: a message he had just received
  over the telephone had very considerably disturbed his composure.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look at that paper," he snapped, making a grab at it.</p>

  <p>"Tush! Tush!" murmured Archie. "Manners, laddie, manners! You've forgotten
  that little word."</p>

  <p>And then at the far end of the hall he saw the girl, and caught his
  breath. For the last two days he had almost forgotten her in the stress of
  other things; now the bitterness of what had to come rose suddenly in his
  throat and choked him.</p>

  <p>"There is the paper. Run away and play in a corner."</p>

  <p>Then he went forward to meet her with his usual lazy smile.</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" she cried, a little breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Heaps of things," he said, gently. "Heaps of things. The principal one
  being that a very worthless sinner loves a very beautiful girl &mdash; as he
  never believed it could be given to man to love." His voice broke and
  faltered: then he went on steadily. "And the next one &mdash; which is really
  even more important &mdash; is that the very beautiful girl will receive a
  letter in a long envelope by tonight's mail. The address will be typed, the
  postmark Strand. I do not want the beautiful girl to open it except in my
  presence. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," she whispered, and her eyes were shining.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen this?" Perrison's voice &mdash; shaking with rage &mdash;
  made Longworth swing round.</p>

  <p>"Seen what, dear lad?" he murmured, taking the paper. "Robbery in City
  &mdash; is that what you mean? Dear, dear &mdash; what dastardly outrages do
  go unpunished these days! Messrs Smith and Co. Really! Watchman bound and
  gagged. Safe rifled. Work of a master hand. Still, though I quite understand
  your horror as a law-abiding citizen at such a thing, why this thusness? I
  mean &mdash; altruism is wonderful, laddie; but it seems to me that it's
  jolly old Smith and Co who are up the pole."</p>

  <p>He burbled on genially, serenely unconscious of the furious face of the
  other man.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to think where I've met you before, Mr Longworth," snarled
  Perrison.</p>

  <p>"Never, surely," murmured the other. "Those classic features, I feel sure,
  would have been indelibly printed on my mind. Perhaps in some mission, Mr
  Perrison &mdash; some evangelical revival meeting. Who knows? And there, if I
  mistake not, is the mail."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the girl, and she was staring at him wonderingly. Just for
  one moment did he show her what she wanted to know &mdash; just for one
  moment did she give him back the answer which was to him the sweetest and at
  the same time the most bitter in the world. Then he crossed the hall and
  picked up the letters.</p>

  <p>"A business one for you, Miss Daventry," he murmured, mildly. "Better open
  it at once, and get our business expert's advice. Mr Perrison is a wonderful
  fellah for advice."</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers she opened the envelope, and, as he saw the
  contents, Perrison, with a snarl of ungovernable fury, made as if to snatch
  them out of her hand. The next moment he felt as if his arm was broken, and
  the blue eyes boring into his brain were no longer lazy.</p>

  <p>"You forgot yourself, Mr Perrison," said Archie Longworth, gently. "Don't
  do that again."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," cried the girl, bewildered. "What are these
  papers?"</p>

  <p>"May I see?" Longworth held out his hand, and she gave them to him at
  once.</p>

  <p>"They're stolen." Perrison's face was livid. "Give them to me, curse
  you."</p>

  <p>"Control yourself, you horrible blighter," said Longworth, icily. "This,"
  he continued, calmly, "would appear to be a receipt from Messrs Gross and
  Sons for the return of a pearl necklace &mdash; sent out to Mr Daventry on
  approval."</p>

  <p>"But you said he'd bought it and pawned it." She turned furiously on
  Perrison.</p>

  <p>"So he did," snarled that gentleman. "That's a forgery."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said Longworth. "That strikes me as being Johnson's signature.
  Firm's official paper. And &mdash; er &mdash; he has the necklace, I &mdash;
  er &mdash; assume."</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; he has the necklace. Stolen last night by &mdash; by&mdash;"
  His eyes were fixed venomously on Longworth.</p>

  <p>"Go on," murmured the other. "You're being most enter-taining."</p>

  <p>But a sudden change had come over Perrison's face &mdash; a dawning
  recognition. "By God!" he muttered, "you're &mdash; you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm &mdash; who? It'll come in time, laddie &mdash; if you give it a
  chance. And in the meantime we might examine these other papers. Now, this
  appears to my inexperienced eye to be a transaction entered into on the one
  part by Messrs Smith and Co and on the other by William Daventry. And it
  concerns filthy lucre. Dear, dear. Twenty-five per cent per month. Three
  hundred per cent. Positive usury, Mr Perrison. Don't you agree with me? A
  rapacious bloodsucker is Mr Smith."</p>

  <p>But the other man was not listening: full recollection had come to him,
  and with a cold look of triumph he put his hands into his pockets and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty," he remarked. "Very pretty indeed. And how, in your
  vernacular, do you propose to get away with the swag, Mr Flash Pete? I rather
  think the police &mdash; whom I propose to call up on the phone in one minute
  &mdash; will be delighted to see such an old and elusive friend."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the girl, and laughed again at the look on her face.</p>

  <p>"What's he mean, Archie?" she cried, wildly. "What's he mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," Perrison sneered, "that Mr Archie Longworth is what is generally
  described as a swell crook with a reputation in certain unsavoury circles
  extending over two or three continents. And the police, whom I propose to
  ring up, will welcome him as a long-lost child."</p>

  <p>He walked towards the telephone, and with a little gasp of fear the girl
  turned to Archie.</p>

  <p>"Say it's not true, dear &mdash; say it's not true."</p>

  <p>For a moment he looked at her with a whimsical smile; then he sat down on
  the high fender round the open fire.</p>

  <p>"I think, Mr Perrison," he murmured, gently, "that if I were you I would
  not be too precipitate over ringing up the police. The engaging warrior who
  sent this letter to Miss Daventry put in yet one more enclosure."</p>

  <p>Perrison turned round: then he stood very still.</p>

  <p>"A most peculiar document," continued the man by the fire, in the same
  gentle voice, "which proves very conclusively that amongst their other
  activities Messrs Smith and Co are not only the receivers of stolen goods,
  but are mixed up with illicit diamond buying."</p>

  <p>In dead silence the two men stared at one another; then Longworth spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"I shall keep these three documents, Mr Perrison, as a safeguard for your
  future good behaviour. Mr Daventry can pay a certain fair sum or not as he
  likes &mdash; that is his business: and I shall make a point of explaining
  exactly to him who and what you are &mdash; and Smith &mdash; and Gross. But
  should you be disposed to make any trouble over the necklace &mdash; or
  should the idea get abroad that Flash Pete was responsible for the burglary
  last night &mdash; it will be most unfortunate for you &mdash; most. This
  document would interest Scotland Yard immensely."</p>

  <p>Perrison's face had grown more and more livid as he listened, and when the
  quiet voice ceased, unmindful of the girl standing by, he began to curse
  foully and hideously. The next moment he cowered back, as two iron hands
  gripped his shoulders and shook him till his teeth rattled.</p>

  <p>"Stop, you filthy swine," snarled Longworth, "or I'll break every bone in
  your body. Quite a number of men are blackguards, Perrison &mdash; but you're
  a particularly creeping and repugnant specimen. Now &mdash; get out &mdash;
  and do it quickly. The nine-thirty will do you nicely. And don't forget what
  I've just said: because, as there's a God above, I mean it."</p>

  <p>"I'll be even with you for this some day, Flash Pete," said the other
  venomously over his shoulder. "And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then," said Longworth, contemptuously, "we will resume this
  discussion. Just now &mdash; get out."</p>

  <p align="center">V</p>

  <p>"Yes: it is quite true." She had known it was &mdash; and yet, womanlike,
  she had clung to the hope that there was some mistake &mdash; some
  explanation. And now, alone with the man she had grown to love, the faint
  hope died. With his lazy smile, he stared down at her &mdash; a smile so full
  of sorrow and pain that she could not bear to see it.</p>

  <p>"I'm Flash Pete &mdash; with an unsavoury reputation, as our friend so
  kindly told you, in three continents. It was I who broke open the safe at
  Smith's last night, I who got the receipt from Gross. You see, I spotted the
  whole trick from the beginning; as I said, I had inside information. And
  Perrison is Smith and Co; moreover he's very largely Gross as well &mdash;
  and half a dozen other rotten things in addition. The whole thing was worked
  with one end in view right from the beginning: the girl your brother
  originally bought the pearls for was in it; it was she who suggested the
  pawning. Bill told me that the night before last." He sighed and paced two or
  three times up and down the dim-lit conservatory. And after a while he
  stopped in front of her again, and his blue eyes were very tender.</p>

  <p>"Just a common sneak-thief &mdash; just a common worthless sinner. And
  he's very, very glad that he has been privileged to help the most beautiful
  girl in all the world. Don't cry, my dear, don't cry: there's nothing about
  that sinner's that's worth a single tear of yours. You must forget his wild
  presumption in falling in love with that beautiful girl: his only excuse is
  that he couldn't help it. And maybe, in the days to come, the girl will think
  kindly every now and then of a man known to some as Archie Longworth &mdash;
  known to others as Flash Pete &mdash; known to himself as &mdash; well, we
  won't bother about that."</p>

  <p>He bent quickly and raised her hand to his lips; then he was gone almost
  before she had realised it. And if he heard her little gasping cry &mdash;
  "Archie, my man, come back &mdash; I love you so!" he gave no sign.</p>

  <p>For in his own peculiar code a very worthless sinner must remain a very
  worthless sinner to the end &mdash; and he must run the course alone.</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9">IX. &mdash; JIMMY LETHBRIDGE'S TEMPTATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What a queer little place, Jimmy!" The girl glanced round
the tiny
  restaurant with frank interest, and the man looked up from the menu he was
  studying with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Don't let François hear you say that, or you'll be asked to leave." The
  headwaiter was already bearing down on them, his face wreathed in an
  expansive smile of welcome. "To him it is the only restaurant in London."</p>

  <p>"Ah, m'sieur! it is long days since you were here." The little Frenchman
  rubbed his hands together delightedly. "And mam'selle &mdash; it is your
  first visit to Les Coquelins, n'est-ce-pas?"</p>

  <p>"But not the last, I hope, François," said the girl with a gentle
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah, mais non!" Outraged horror at such an impossible idea shone all over
  the headwaiter's face. "My guests, mam'selle, they come here once to see what
  it is like &mdash; and they return because they know what it is like."</p>

  <p>Jimmy Lethbridge laughed.</p>

  <p>"There you are, Molly," he cried. "Now you know what's expected of you.
  Nothing less than once a week &mdash; eh, François?"</p>

  <p>"Mais oui, m'sieur. There are some who come every night." He produced his
  pencil and stood waiting. "A few oysters," he murmured. "They are good ce
  soir: real Whitstables. And a bird, M'sieur Lethbridge &mdash; with an
  omelette aux fines herbes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sounds excellent, François," laughed the man. "Anyway, I know that once
  you have decided &mdash; argument is futile."</p>

  <p>"It is my work," answered the waiter, shrugging his shoulders. "And a
  bottle of Corton &mdash; with the chill just off. Toute de suite."</p>

  <p>Francois bustled away, and the girl looked across the table with a faintly
  amused smile in her big grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"He fits the place, Jimmy. You must bring me here again."</p>

  <p>"Just as often as you like, Molly," answered the man quietly, and after a
  moment the girl turned away. "You know," he went on steadily, "how much
  sooner I'd bring you to a spot like this, than go to the Ritz or one of those
  big places. Only I was afraid it might bore you. I love it: it's so much more
  intimate."</p>

  <p>"Why should you think it would bore me?" she asked, drawing off her gloves
  and resting her hands on the table in front of her. They were beautiful
  hands, ringless save for one plain signet ring on the little finger of her
  left hand. And, almost against his will, the man found himself staring at it
  as he answered: "Because I can't trust myself, dear; I can't trust myself to
  amuse you," he answered slowly. "I can't trust myself not to make love to you
  &mdash; and it's so much easier here than in the middle of a crowd whom one
  knows."</p>

  <p>The girl sighed a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jimmy, I wish I could! You've been such an absolute dear. Give me a
  little longer, old man, and then &mdash; perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear," said the man hoarsely, "I don't want to hurry you. I'm willing
  to wait years for you &mdash; years. At least" &mdash; he smiled whimsically
  &mdash; "I'm not a little bit willing to wait years &mdash; really. But if
  it's that or nothing &mdash; then, believe me, I'm more than willing."</p>

  <p>"I've argued it out with myself, Jimmy." And now she was staring at the
  signet ring on her finger. "And when I've finished the argument, I know that
  I'm not a bit further on. You can't argue over things like that. I've told
  myself times out of number that it isn't fair to you &mdash; "</p>

  <p>He started to speak, but she stopped him with a smile.</p>

  <p>"No, dear man, it is not fair to you &mdash; whatever you like to say. It
  isn't fair to you even though you may agree to go on waiting. No one has a
  right to ask another person to wait indefinitely, though I'm thinking that is
  exactly what I've been doing. Which is rather like a woman," and once again
  she smiled half sadly.</p>

  <p>"But I'm willing to wait, dear," he repeated gently. "And then I'm willing
  to take just as much as you care to give. I won't worry you, Molly; I won't
  ask you for anything you don't feel like granting me. You see, I know now
  that Peter must always come first. I had hoped that you'd forget him; I still
  hope, dear, that in time you will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and the man bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"Well, even if you don't, Molly," he went on steadily, "is it fair to
  yourself to go on when you know it's hopeless? There can be no doubt now that
  he's dead; you know it yourself &mdash; you've taken off your engagement ring
  &mdash; and is it fair to &mdash; you? Don't worry about me for the moment
  &mdash; but what is the use? Isn't it better to face facts?"</p>

  <p>The girl gave a little laugh that was half a sob.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is, Jimmy. Much better. I always tell myself that in my
  arguments." Then she looked at him steadily across the table. "You'd be
  content, Jimmy &mdash; would you? &mdash; with friendship at first."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered quietly. "I would be content with friendship."</p>

  <p>"And you wouldn't bother me &mdash; ah, no! forgive me, I know you
  wouldn't. Because, Jimmy, I don't want there to be any mistake. People think
  I've got over it because I go about; in some ways I have. But I seem to have
  lost something &mdash; some part of me. I don't think I shall ever be able to
  <i>love</i> a man again. I like you, Jimmy &mdash; like you most frightfully
  &mdash; but I don't know whether I'll ever be able to love you in the way I
  loved Peter."</p>

  <p>"I know that," muttered the man. "And I'll risk it."</p>

  <p>"You dear!" said the girl &mdash; and her eyes were shining. "That's where
  the unfairness comes in. You're worth the very best &mdash; and I can't
  promise to give it to you."</p>

  <p>"You are the very best, whatever you give me," answered the man quietly.
  "I'd sooner have anything from you than everything from another woman. Oh, my
  dear!" he burst out, "I didn't mean to worry you tonight &mdash; though I
  knew this damned restaurant would be dangerous &mdash; but can't you say yes?
  I swear you'll never regret it, dear &mdash; and I &mdash; I'll be quite
  content to know that you care just a bit."</p>

  <p>For a while the girl was silent; then with a faint smile she looked at him
  across the table.</p>

  <p>"All right, Jimmy," she said.</p>

  <p>"You mean you will, Molly?" he cried, a little breathlessly.</p>

  <p>And the girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, old man," she answered steadily. "I mean I will."</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>It was two hours later when Molly Daventry went slowly upstairs to her
  room and shut the door. Jimmy Lethbridge had just gone; she had just kissed
  him. And the echo of his last whispered words &mdash; "My dear! my very dear
  girl!" &mdash; was still sounding in her ears.</p>

  <p>For a while she stood by the fireplace smiling a little sadly. Then she
  crossed the room and switched on a special light. It was so placed that it
  shone directly on the photograph of an officer in the full dress of the 9th
  Hussars. And at length she knelt down in front of the table on which the
  photograph stood, so that the light fell on her own face also &mdash;
  glinting through the red-gold of her hair, glistening in the mistiness of her
  eyes. For maybe five minutes she knelt there, till it seemed to her as if a
  smile twitched round the lips of the officer &mdash; a human smile, an
  understanding smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Peter!" she whispered, "he was your pal. Forgive me, my love &mdash;
  forgive me. He's been such a dear."</p>

  <p>And once again the photograph seemed to smile at her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"It's only you, Peter, till Journey's End &mdash; but I must give him the
  next best, mustn't I? It's only fair, isn't it? &mdash; and you hated
  unfairness. But, dear God! it's hard."</p>

  <p>Slowly she stretched out her left hand, so that the signet ring touched
  the big silver frame.</p>

  <p>"Your ring, Peter," she whispered, "your dear ring."</p>

  <p>And with a sudden little choking gasp she raised it to her lips.</p>

  <p align="center">II</p>

  <p>It was in a side-street close to High Street, Kensington, that it happened
  &mdash; the unbelievable thing. Fate decided to give Jimmy two months of
  happiness; cynically allowed him to come within a fortnight of his wedding,
  and then &mdash;</p>

  <p>For a few seconds he couldn't believe his eyes; he stood staring like a
  man bereft of his senses. There on the opposite side of the road, playing a
  barrel organ, was Peter himself &mdash; Peter, who had been reported
  "Missing, believed killed", three years before. Peter, whom a sergeant had
  categorically said he had seen killed with his own eyes. And there he was
  playing a barrel organ in the streets of London.</p>

  <p>Like a man partially dazed Jimmy Lethbridge went over towards him. As he
  approached the player smiled genially, and touched his cap with his free
  hand. Then after a while the smile faded, and he stared at Jimmy
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"My God, Peter!" Lethbridge heard himself say, "what are you doing this
  for?"</p>

  <p>And as he spoke he saw a girl approaching &mdash; a girl who placed
  herself aggressively beside Peter.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I?" demanded the player. "And who the hell are you calling
  Peter?"</p>

  <p>"But," stammered Jimmy, "don't you know me, old man?"</p>

  <p>"No!" returned the other truculently. "And I don't want to, neither."</p>

  <p>"A ruddy torf, 'e is, Bill," chimed in the girl.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" muttered Lethbridge, even then failing to understand the
  situation. "You playing a barrel organ!"</p>

  <p>"Look here, 'op it, guv'nor." Peter spoke with dangerous calmness. "I
  don't want no blinking scenes 'ere. The police ain't too friendly as it is,
  and this is my best pitch."</p>

  <p>"But why didn't you let your pals know you were back, old man?" said Jimmy
  feebly. "Your governor, and all of us?"</p>

  <p>"See 'ere, mister," the girl stepped forward, "'e ain't got no pals
  &mdash; only me. Ain't that so, Billy?" she turned to the man, who
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I looks after him, I do, d'yer see?" went on the girl. "And I don't want
  no one coming butting their ugly heads in. It worries 'im, it does."</p>

  <p>"But do you mean to say&mdash;" began Jimmy dazedly, and then he broke
  off. At last he understood, something if not all. In some miraculous way
  Peter had not been killed; Peter was there in front of him &mdash; but a new
  Peter; a Peter whose memory of the past had completely gone, whose mind was
  as blank as a clean-washed slate.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been doing this?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind," said the girl sharply. "He ain't nothing to you. I looks
  after 'im, I do."</p>

  <p>Not for a second did Jimmy hesitate, though deep down inside him there
  came a voice that whispered &mdash; "Don't be a fool! Pretend it's a mistake.
  Clear off! Molly will never know." And if for a moment his hands clenched
  with the strength of the sudden hideous temptation, his voice was calm and
  quiet as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong." He looked at her gently. "He is something to
  me &mdash; my greatest friend, whom I thought was dead."</p>

  <p>And now Peter was staring at him fixedly, forgetting even to turn the
  handle of the machine.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember yer, guv'nor," he said, and Jimmy flinched at the
  appalling accent. "I've kind o' lost my memory, yer see, and Lizzie 'ere
  looks after me."</p>

  <p>"I know she does," continued Jimmy quietly. "Thank you, Lizzie, thank you
  a thousand times. But I want you both to come to this house tonight." He
  scribbled the address of his rooms on a slip of paper. "We must think what is
  best to be done. You see, Lizzie, it's not quite fair to him, is it? I want
  to get a good doctor to see him."</p>

  <p>"I'm quite 'appy as I am, sir," said Peter. "I don't want no doctors
  messing about with me."</p>

  <p>"Yer'd better go, Bill." The girl turned to him. "The gentleman seems
  kind. But" &mdash; she swung round on Jimmy fiercely &mdash; "you ain't going
  to take 'im away from me, guv'nor? 'E's mine, yer see &mdash;
  mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want you to come with him tonight, Lizzie," said Lethbridge gravely.
  "I'm not going to try and take him away from you. I promise that. But will
  you promise to come? It's for his sake I ask you to bring him."</p>

  <p>For a while she looked at him half fearfully; then she glanced at Peter,
  who had apparently lost interest in the matter. And at last she muttered
  under her breath: "Orl right &mdash; I'll bring him. But 'e's mine &mdash;
  mine. An' don't yer go forgetting it."</p>

  <p>And Jimmy, walking slowly into the main street, carried with him the
  remembrance of a small determined face with the look on it of a mother
  fighting for her young. That and Peter; poor dazed memory-lost Peter &mdash;
  his greatest pal.</p>

  <p>At first, as he turned towards Piccadilly, he grasped nothing save the one
  stupendous fact that Peter was not dead. Then, as he walked on, gradually the
  realisation of what it meant to him personally came to his mind. And with
  that realisation there returned with redoubled force the insidious tempting
  voice that had first whispered: "Molly will never know." She would never know
  &mdash; could never know &mdash; unless he told her. And Peter was happy;
  he'd said so. And the girl was happy &mdash; Lizzie. And perhaps &mdash; in
  fact most likely &mdash; Peter would never recover his memory. So what was
  the use? Why say anything about it? Why not say it was a mistake when they
  came that evening? And Jimmy put his hand to his forehead and found it was
  wet with sweat.</p>

  <p>After all, if Peter didn't recover, it would only mean fearful unhappiness
  for everyone. He wouldn't know Molly, and it would break her heart, and the
  girl's, and &mdash; but, of course, <i>he</i> didn't count. It was the others
  he was thinking of &mdash; not himself.</p>

  <p>He turned into the Park opposite the Albert Hall, and passers-by eyed him
  strangely, though he was supremely unaware of the fact. But when all the
  demons of hell are fighting inside a man, his face is apt to look grey and
  haggard. And as he walked slowly towards Hyde Park Corner, Jimmy Lethbridge
  went through his Gethsemane. They thronged him; pressing in on him from all
  sides, and he cursed the devils out loud. But still they came back, again and
  again, and the worst and most devilish of them all was the insidious
  temptation that by keeping silent he would be doing the greatest good for the
  greatest number. Everyone was happy now &mdash; why run the risk of altering
  things?</p>

  <p>And then, because it is not good that man should be tempted till he
  breaks, the Fate that had led him to Peter, led him gently out of the Grim
  Garden into Peace once more. He gave a short hard laugh which was almost a
  sob, and turning into Knightsbridge he hailed a taxi. It was as it drew up at
  the door of Molly's house that he laughed again &mdash; a laugh that had lost
  its hardness. And the driver thought his fare's "Thank you" was addressed to
  him. Perhaps it was. Perhaps it was the first time Jimmy had prayed for ten
  years.</p>

  <p>"Why, Jimmy, old man &mdash; you're early, I'm not dressed yet." Molly met
  him in the hall, and he smiled at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind, dear," he said, "if I cry off tonight? I've got a very
  important engagement &mdash; even more important than taking you out to
  dinner, if possible."</p>

  <p>The smile grew whimsical, and he put both his hands on her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It concerns my wedding present for you," he added.</p>

  <p>"From the bridegroom to the bride?" she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Something like that," he said, turning away abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Of course, dear," she answered. "As a matter of fact, I've got a bit of a
  head. Though what present you can be getting at this time of day, I can't
  think."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't try to," said Jimmy. "It's a surprise, Molly &mdash; a
  surprise. Pray God you like it, and that it will be a success!"</p>

  <p>He spoke low under his breath, and the girl looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, dear?" she cried. "Has something happened?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy Lethbridge pulled himself together; he didn't want her to suspect
  anything yet.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, no!" he laughed. "What should have? But I want to borrow
  something from you, Molly dear, and I don't want you to ask any questions. I
  want you to lend me that photograph of Peter that you've got &mdash; the one
  in full dress."</p>

  <p>And now she was staring at him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy," she said breathlessly, "does it concern the present?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; it concerns the present."</p>

  <p>"You're going to have a picture of him painted for me?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that," he answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you dear!" she whispered, "you dear! I've been thinking about it for
  months. I'll get it for you."</p>

  <p>She went upstairs, and the man stood still in the hall staring after her.
  And he was still standing motionless as she came down again, the precious
  frame clasped in her hands.</p>

  <p>"You'll take care of it, Jimmy?" she said, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>Then for a moment she laid her hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"I don't think, old man," she said quietly, "that you'll have to wait very
  long with friendship only."</p>

  <p>The next moment she was alone with the slam of the front door echoing in
  her ears. It was like Fate to reserve its most deadly arrow for the end.</p>

  <p align="center">III</p>

  <p>"You say he has completely lost his memory?"</p>

  <p>Mainwaring, one of the most brilliant of London's younger surgeons, leaned
  back in his chair and looked thoughtfully at his host.</p>

  <p>"Well, he didn't know me, and I was his greatest friend," said
  Lethbridge.</p>

  <p>The two men were in Jimmy's rooms, waiting for the arrival of Peter and
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"He looked at me without a trace of recognition," continued Lethbridge.
  "And he's developed a typical lower-class Cockney accent."</p>

  <p>"Interesting, very," murmured the surgeon, getting up and examining the
  photograph on the table. "This is new, isn't it, old boy; I've never seen it
  before?"</p>

  <p>"I borrowed it this afternoon," said Jimmy briefly.</p>

  <p>"From his people, I suppose? Do they know?"</p>

  <p>"No one knows at present, Mainwaring &mdash; except you and me. That
  photograph I got this afternoon from Miss Daventry."</p>

  <p>Something in his tone made the surgeon swing round.</p>

  <p>"You mean your fiancée?" he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; my fiancée. You see, she was &mdash; she was engaged to
  Peter. And she thinks he's dead. That is the only reason she got engaged to
  me."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, while Mainwaring stared at the other. A
  look of wonder had come into the doctor's eyes &mdash; wonder mixed with a
  dawning admiration.</p>

  <p>"But, my God! old man," he muttered at length, "if the operation is
  successful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can you think of a better wedding present to give a girl than the man she
  loves?" said Jimmy slowly, and the doctor turned away. There are times when
  it is not good to look on another man's face.</p>

  <p>"And if it isn't successful?" he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"God knows, Bill. I haven't got as far as that &mdash; yet."</p>

  <p>And it was at that moment that there came a ring at the front-door bell.
  There was a brief altercation; then Jimmy's man appeared.</p>

  <p>"Two &mdash; er &mdash; persons say you told them&mdash;" he began, when
  Lethbridge cut him short.</p>

  <p>"Show them in at once," he said briefly, and his man went out again.</p>

  <p>"You've got to remember, Bill," said Jimmy as they waited, "that Peter
  Staunton is literally, at the moment, a low-class Cockney."</p>

  <p>Mainwaring nodded, and drew back a little as Peter and the girl came into
  the room. He wanted to leave the talking to Jimmy, while he watched.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Lizzie," Lethbridge smiled at the girl reassuringly. "I'm
  glad you came."</p>

  <p>"Who's that cove?" demanded the girl suspiciously, staring at
  Mainwaring.</p>

  <p>"A doctor," said Jimmy. "I want him to have a look at Peter later on."</p>

  <p>"His name ain't Peter," muttered the girl sullenly. "It's Bill."</p>

  <p>"Well, at Bill, then. Don't be frightened, Lizzie; come farther into the
  room. I want you to see a photograph I've got here."</p>

  <p>Like a dog who wonders whether it is safe to go to a stranger, she
  advanced slowly, one step at a time; while Peter, twirling his cap awkwardly
  in his hands, kept beside her. Once or twice he glanced uneasily round the
  room, but otherwise his eyes were fixed on Lizzie as a child looks at its
  mother when it's scared.</p>

  <p>"My God, Jimmy!" whispered the doctor, "there's going to be as big a
  sufferer as you if we're successful."</p>

  <p>And he was looking as he spoke at the girl, who, with a sudden instinctive
  feeling of protection, had put out her hand and taken Peter's.</p>

  <p>Like a pair of frightened children they crept on until they came to the
  photograph; then they stopped in front of it. And the two men came a little
  closer. It was the girl who spoke first, in a low voice of wondering awe:
  "Gawd! it's you, Bill &mdash; that there bloke in the frame. You were a
  blinking orficer."</p>

  <p>With a look of pathetic pride on her face, she stared first at the
  photograph and then at the man beside her. "An orficer! Bill &mdash; an
  orficer! What was 'is regiment, mister?" The girl swung round on Jimmy. "Was
  'e in the Guards?"</p>

  <p>"No, Lizzie," said Lethbridge. "Not the Guards. He was in the cavalry. The
  9th Hussars," and the man, who was holding the frame foolishly in his hands,
  suddenly looked up. "The Devil's Own, Peter," went on Lethbridge quietly. "C
  Squadron of the Devil's Own."</p>

  <p>But the look had faded; Peter's face was blank again.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember, guv'nor," he muttered. "And it's making me 'ead ache
  &mdash; this."</p>

  <p>With a little cry the girl caught his arm, and faced Lethbridge
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Wot's the good of all this?" she cried. "All this muckin' abaht? Why the
  'ell can't you leave 'im alone, guv'nor? 'E's going to 'ave one of 'is 'eads
  now &mdash; 'e nearly goes mad, 'e does, when 'e gets 'em."</p>

  <p>"I think, Lizzie, that perhaps I can cure those heads of his."</p>

  <p>It was Mainwaring speaking, and the girl, still holding Peter's arm
  protectingly, looked from Lethbridge to the doctor.</p>

  <p>"And I want to examine him, in another room where the light is a little
  better. Just quite alone, where he won't be distracted."</p>

  <p>But instantly the girl was up in arms.</p>

  <p>"You're taking 'im away from me &mdash; that's wot yer doing. And I won't
  'ave it. Yer don't want to go, Bill, do yer? Yer don't want to leave yer
  Liz?"</p>

  <p>And Jimmy Lethbridge bit his lip; Mainwaring had been right.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to take him away, Lizzie," said the doctor gently. "I
  promise you that. You shall see him the very instant I've made my
  examination. But if you're there, you see, you'll distract his
  attention."</p>

  <p>She took a step forward, staring at the doctor as if she would read his
  very soul. And in the infinite pathos of the scene, Jimmy Lethbridge for the
  moment forgot his own suffering. Lizzie &mdash; the little slum girl &mdash;
  fighting for her man against something she couldn't understand; wondering if
  she should trust these two strangers. Caught in a net that frightened her;
  fearful that they were going to harm Bill. And at the bottom of everything
  the wild, inarticulate terror that she was going to lose him.</p>

  <p>"You swear it?" she muttered. "I can see 'im after yer've looked at
  'im."</p>

  <p>"I swear it," said Mainwaring gravely.</p>

  <p>She gave a little sob. "Orl right, I believe yer on the level. You go with
  'im, Bill. Perhaps 'e'll do yer 'ead good."</p>

  <p>"'E's queer sometimes at night," said Lizzie, as the door closed behind
  Mainwaring. "Seems all dazed like."</p>

  <p>"Is he?" said Jimmy. "How did you find him, Lizzie?"</p>

  <p>"'E was wandering round &mdash; didn't know nuthing about 'imself," she
  answered. "And I took 'im in &mdash; and looked after 'im, I did. Saved and
  pinched a bit, 'ere and there &mdash; and then we've the barrel organ. And
  we've been so 'appy, mister &mdash; so 'appy. Course 'e's a bit queer, and 'e
  don't remember nuthing &mdash; but 'e's orl right if 'e don't get 'is
  'eadaches. And when 'e does, I gets rid of them. I jest puts 'is 'cad on me
  lap and strokes 'is forehead &mdash; and they goes after a while. Sometimes
  'e goes to sleep when I'm doing it &mdash; and I stops there till 'e wakes
  again with the 'ead gone. Yer see, I understands 'im. 'E's 'appy with
  me."</p>

  <p>She was staring at the photograph &mdash; a pathetic little figure in her
  tawdry finery &mdash; and for a moment Jimmy couldn't speak. It had to be
  done; he had to do it &mdash; but it felt rather like killing a wounded bird
  with a sledge-hammer &mdash; except that it wouldn't be so quick.</p>

  <p>"He's a great brain surgeon, Lizzie &mdash; the gentleman with Bill," he
  said at length, and the girl turned round and watched him gravely. "And he
  thinks that an operation might cure him and give him back his memory."</p>

  <p>"So that 'e'd know 'e was an orficer?" whispered the girl.</p>

  <p>"So that he'd know he was an officer," said Jimmy. "So that he'd remember
  all his past life. You see, Lizzie, your Bill is really Sir Peter Staunton
  &mdash; whom we all thought had been killed in the war."</p>

  <p>"Sir Peter Staunton!" she repeated dazedly. "Gawd!"</p>

  <p>"He was engaged, Lizzie," he went on quietly, and he heard her breath come
  quick &mdash; "engaged to that lady." He pointed to a picture of Sybil on the
  mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"No one wouldn't look at me with 'er about," said the girl
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"She loved him very dearly, Lizzie &mdash; even as he loved her. I don't
  think I've ever known two people who loved one another quite so much.
  And&mdash;" for a moment Jimmy faltered, then he went on steadily: "I ought
  to know in this case, because I'm engaged to her now."</p>

  <p>And because the Cockney brain is quick, she saw &mdash; and
  understood.</p>

  <p>"So if yer doctor friend succeeds," she said, "she'll give yer the
  chuck?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lizzie," answered Jimmy gravely, "she'll give me the chuck."</p>

  <p>"And yer love 'er? Orl right, old sport. I can see it in yer face. Strikes
  me" &mdash; and she gave a little laugh that was sadder than any tears
  &mdash; "strikes me you 'anded out the dirty end of the stick to both of us
  when you come round that street today."</p>

  <p>"Strikes me I did, Lizzie," he agreed. "But, you see, I've told you this
  because I want you to understand that we're both of us in it &mdash; we've
  both of us got to play the game."</p>

  <p>"Play the game!" she muttered. "Wot d'yer want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"The doctor doesn't want him excited, Lizzie," explained Lethbridge. "But
  he wants him to stop here tonight, so that he can operate tomorrow. Will you
  tell him that you want him to stop here? &mdash; and stay here with him if
  you like."</p>

  <p>"And tomorrer she'll tike 'im." The girl was staring at Sybil's
  photograph. "'E won't look at me &mdash; when 'e knows. Gawd! why did yer
  find 'im &mdash; why did yer find 'im? We was 'appy, I tells yer &mdash;
  'appy?"</p>

  <p>She was crying now &mdash; crying as a child cries, weakly and pitifully,
  and Lethbridge stood watching her in silence.</p>

  <p>"Poor kid!" he said at length. "Poor little kid!"</p>

  <p>"I don't want yer pity," she flared up. "I want my man." And then, as she
  saw Jimmy looking at the photograph on the mantelpiece, in an instant she was
  beside him. "Sorry, old sport," she whispered impulsively. "Reckon you've
  backed a ruddy loser yourself. I'll do it. Shake 'ands. I guess I knew all
  along that Bill wasn't really my style. And I've 'ad my year."</p>

  <p>"You're lucky, Lizzie," said Jimmy gravely, still holding her hand. "Very,
  very lucky."</p>

  <p>"I've 'ad my year," she went on, and for a moment her thoughts seemed far
  away. "A 'ole year &mdash; and&mdash;" she pulled herself together and
  started patting her hair.</p>

  <p>"And what, Lizzie?" said Jimmy quietly.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind, mister," she answered. "That's my blooming business."</p>

  <p>And then the door opened and Mainwaring came in.</p>

  <p>"Does Lizzie agree?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Bill &mdash; she agrees," said Jimmy. "What do you think of
  him?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I can see there is every hope that an operation will be
  completely successful. There is evidently pressure on the right side of the
  skull which can be removed. I'll operate early tomorrow morning. Keep him
  quiet tonight &mdash; and make him sleep, Lizzie, if you can."</p>

  <p>"What d'yer think, mister?" she said scornfully. "Ain't I done it fer a
  year?"</p>

  <p>Without another word she left the room, and the two men stood staring at
  one another.</p>

  <p>"Will she play the game, Jimmy!" Mainwaring was lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; she'll play the game," answered Lethbridge slowly. "She'll
  play the game &mdash; poor little kid!"</p>

  <p>"What terms are they on &mdash; those two?" The doctor looked at him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Lethbridge even more slowly, "that that is a question we
  had better not inquire into too closely."</p>

  <p align="center">IV</p>

  <p>It was successful &mdash; brilliantly successful &mdash; the operation.
  Lizzie made it so; at any rate she helped considerably. It was she who held
  his hand as he went under the anaesthetic; it was she who cheered him up in
  the morning, when he awoke dazed and frightened in a strange room. And then
  she slipped away and disappeared from the house. It was only later that
  Lethbridge found a scrawled pencil note, strangely smudged, on his desk: "Let
  me no wot appens &mdash; LIZZIE."</p>

  <p>He didn't know her address, so he couldn't write and tell her that her
  Bill had come to consciousness again, completely recovered except for one
  thing. There was another blank in his mind now &mdash; the last three years.
  One of his first questions had been to ask how the fight had gone, and
  whether we'd broken through properly.</p>

  <p>And then for a day or two Lizzie was forgotten; he had to make his own
  renunciation.</p>

  <p>Molly came, a little surprised at his unusual invitation, and he left the
  door open so that she could see Peter in bed from one part of his sitting
  room.</p>

  <p>"Where have you buried yourself, Jimmy?" she cried. "I've been&mdash;"And
  then her face grew deathly white as she looked into the bedroom. Her lips
  moved, though no sound came from them; her hands were clenching and
  unclenching.</p>

  <p>"But I'm mad," he heard her whisper at length, "quite mad. I'm seeing
  things, Jimmy &mdash; seeing things. Why &mdash; dear God! it's Peter!"</p>

  <p>She took a step or two forward, and Peter saw her.</p>

  <p>"Molly," he cried weakly, "Molly, my darling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And Jimmy Lethbridge saw her walk forward slowly and uncertainly to the
  man who had come back. With a shaking little cry of pure joy she fell on her
  knees beside the bed, and Peter put a trembling hand on her hair. Then Jimmy
  shut the door, and stared blankly in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was Lizzie who roused him &mdash; Lizzie coming shyly into the room
  from the hall.</p>

  <p>"I seed her come in," she whispered. "She looked orl right. 'Ow is
  'e?"</p>

  <p>"He's got his memory back, Lizzie," he said gently. "But he's forgotten
  the last three years."</p>

  <p>"Forgotten me, as 'e?" Her lips quivered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lizzie. Forgotten everything &mdash; barrel organ and all. He thinks
  he's on sick leave from the war."</p>

  <p>"And she's wiv 'im now, is she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; she's with him, Lizzie."</p>

  <p>She took a deep breath &mdash; then she walked to the glass and arranged
  her hat &mdash; a dreadful hat with feathers in it.</p>

  <p>"Well, I reckons I'd better be going. I don't want to see 'im. It would
  break me 'eart. And I said goodbye to 'im that last night before the
  operation. So long, mister. I've 'ad me year &mdash; she can't tike that away
  from me."</p>

  <p>And then she was gone. He watched her from the window walking along the
  pavement, with the feathers nodding at every step. Once she stopped and
  looked back &mdash; and the feathers seemed to wilt and die. Then she went on
  again &mdash; and this time she didn't stop. She'd "'ad 'er year," had
  Lizzie; maybe the remembrance of it helped her gallant little soul when she
  returned the barrel organ &mdash; the useless barrel organ.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>"So this was your present, Jimmy." Molly was speaking just behind him, and
  her eyes were very bright.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Molly," he smiled. "Do you like it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what's happened," she said slowly. "I don't understand
  anything except the one big fact that Peter has come back."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that enough?" he asked gently. "Isn't that enough, my dear? Peter's
  come back &mdash; funny old Peter. The rest will keep."</p>

  <p>And then he took her left hand and drew off the engagement ring he had
  given her.</p>

  <p>"Not on that finger now &mdash; Molly; though I'd like you to keep it now
  if you will."</p>

  <p>For a while she stared at him wonderingly. "Jimmy, but you're big!" she
  whispered at length. "I'm so sorry!" She turned away as Peter's voice, weak
  and tremulous, came from the other room.</p>

  <p>"Come in with me, old man," she said. "Come in and talk to him."</p>

  <p>But Jimmy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't want me, dear; I'm just &mdash; just going out for a
  bit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Abruptly he left the room &mdash; they didn't want him: any more than they
  wanted Lizzie.</p>

  <p>Only she had had her year.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10">X. &mdash; LADY CYNTHIA AND THE HERMIT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"My dear Cynthia, you haven't seen our Hermit yet. He's
quite the show
  exhibit of the place."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia Stockdale yawned and lit a cigarette. Hermits belonged
  undoubtedly to the class of things in which she was <i>not</i> interested;
  the word conjured up a mental picture of a dirty individual of great piety,
  clothed in a sack. And Lady Cynthia loathed dirt and detested piety.</p>

  <p>"A hermit, Ada!" she remarked, lazily. "I thought the brand was extinct.
  Does he feed ravens and things?"</p>

  <p>It is to be regretted that theological knowledge was not her strong point,
  but Ada Laverton, her hostess, did not smile. From beneath some marvellously
  long eyelashes she was watching the lovely girl lying back in the deckchair
  opposite, who was vainly trying to blow smoke rings. A sudden wild idea had
  come into her brain &mdash; so wild as to be almost laughable. But from time
  immemorial wild ideas about their girlfriends have entered the brains of
  young married women, especially the lucky ones who have hooked the right man.
  And Ada Laverton had undoubtedly done that. She alternately bullied, cajoled,
  and made love to her husband John, in a way that eminently suited that
  cheerful and easygoing gentleman. He adored her quite openly and
  ridiculously, and she returned the compliment just as ridiculously, even if
  not quite so openly.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Cynthia Stockdale was her best friend. Before her marriage they
  had been inseparable, and perhaps there was no one living who understood
  Cynthia as she did. To the world at large Cynthia was merely a much
  photographed and capricious beauty. Worthy mothers of daughters, who saw her
  reproduced weekly in the society papers, sighed inwardly with envy, and
  commented on the decadence of the aristocracy: the daughters tore out the
  pictures in a vain endeavour to copy her frocks. But it wasn't the frocks
  that made Cynthia Stockdale: it was she who made the frocks. Put her in
  things selected haphazard from a jumble sale &mdash; put her in remnants
  discarded by the people who got it up, and she would still have seemed the
  best-dressed woman in the room. It was a gift she had &mdash; not acquired,
  but natural.</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia was twenty-five, and looked four years younger. Since the war
  she had been engaged twice &mdash; once to a man in the Blues, and once to a
  young and ambitious Member of Parliament. Neither had lasted long, and on the
  second occasion people had said unkind things. They had called her heartless
  and capricious, and she had scorned to contradict them. It mattered nothing
  to her, what people said: if they didn't like her they could go away and have
  nothing to do with her. And since in her case it wasn't a pose, but the
  literal truth, people did not go away. Only to Ada Laverton did she give her
  real confidence: only to Ada Laverton did she show the real soul that lay
  below the surface.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying," she had said, lying in that same chair a year previously,
  "I'm trying to find the real thing. I needn't marry if I don't want to; I
  haven't got to marry for a home and a roof. And it's got to be the right man.
  Of course I may make a mistake &mdash; a mistake which I shan't find out till
  it's too late. But surely when one has found it out before it's too late,
  it's better to acknowledge it at once. It's no good making a second worse one
  by going through with it. I thought Arthur was all right" &mdash; Arthur was
  the Member of Parliament &mdash; "I'm awfully fond of Arthur still. But I'm
  not the right wife for him. We jarred on one another in a hundred little
  ways. And he hasn't got a sense of humour. I shall never forget the shock I
  got when I first realised that. He seemed to think that a sense of humour
  consisted of laughing at humorous things, of seeing a jest as well as anyone
  else. He didn't seem to understand me when I told him that the real sense of
  humour is often closer to tears than laughter. Besides" &mdash; she had added
  inconsequently &mdash; "he had a dreadful trick of whistling down my neck
  when we danced. No woman can be expected to marry a permanent draught. And as
  for poor old Bill &mdash; well Bill's an angel. I still adore Bill. He is, I
  think, the most supremely handsome being I've ever seen in my life &mdash;
  especially when he's got his full dress on. But, my dear, I blame myself over
  Bill. I ought to have known it before I got engaged to him; as a matter of
  fact I did know it. Bill is, without exception, the biggest fool in London. I
  thought his face might atone for his lack of brains; I thought that perhaps
  if I took him in hand he might do something in the House of Lords &mdash; his
  old father can't live much longer &mdash; but I gave it up. He is simply
  incapable of any coherent thought at all. He can't spell; he can't add, and
  once when I asked him if he liked Rachmaninoff, he thought it was the man who
  had built the Pyramids."</p>

  <p>This and much more came back to Ada Laverton as she turned over in her
  mind the sudden wild idea that had come to her. Above all things she wanted
  to see Cynthia married; she was so utterly happy herself that she longed for
  her friend to share it too. She knew, as no one else did, what a wonderful
  wife and pal Cynthia would make to the right man. But it must be the right
  man; it must be the real thing. And like a blinding flash had come the
  thought of the Hermit &mdash; the Hermit who had come into the neighbourhood
  six months previously, and taken the little farm standing in the hollow
  overlooking the sea. For, as she frequently told John, if it hadn't been for
  the fact that she was tied to a silly old idiot of a husband, she'd have
  married the Hermit herself.</p>

  <p>"No, he doesn't feed ravens," she remarked at length. "Only puppies. He
  breeds Cairns and Aberdeens. We'll stroll up and see him after tea."</p>

  <p>"A hermit breeding dogs!" Cynthia sat up lazily. "My dear, you intrigue
  me."</p>

  <p>"Oh! he's not a bad young man," said Ada Laverton, indifferently. "Quite
  passable looking, DSO and MC and that sort of thing. Been all over the world,
  and is really quite interesting when you can get him to talk."</p>

  <p>"What sort of age?" asked her friend.</p>

  <p>"Thirty to thirty-five. You shall see him. But you're not to go and turn
  his head; he's very peaceful and happy as he is."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't think hermits are much in my line. A man's job is to be up and
  doing; not to bury himself alive and breed dogs."</p>

  <p>"You tell him so," said her hostess. "It will do him good."</p>

  <p align="center">II</p>

  <p>An excited rush of puppies &mdash; fat, bouncing, lolloping puppies; a
  stern order: "Heel, you young blighters, heel!" in a pleasant, cheerful
  voice; a laughing greeting from Ada Laverton, and Lady Cynthia Stockdale
  found herself shaking hands with the Hermit. She shook hands as a man shakes
  hands, with a firm, steady grasp, and she looked the person she was greeting
  straight in the eyes. To her that first handshake meant, more often than not,
  the final estimate of a stranger's character; it always meant the first. And
  her first estimate of Desmond Brooke was good. She saw a man of clear skin
  and clear eye. He wore no hat, and his brown hair, curling a little at the
  temples, was slightly flecked with grey. His face was bronzed and a faint
  smile hovered in the corners of the eyes that met hers fair and square. His
  shirt was open at the neck; the sleeves were rolled up, showing a pair of
  muscular brown arms. He was clean shaven, and his teeth were very white and
  regular. So much, in detail, she noticed during that first half-second; then
  she turned her attention to the puppies.</p>

  <p>"What toppers!" she remarked. "What absolute toppers!"</p>

  <p>She picked a fat, struggling mixture of legs and ecstatically slobbering
  tongue out of the mêlée at her feet, and the Hermit watched her gravely. It
  struck him that in the course of a fairly crowded life he had never seen a
  more lovely picture than the one made by this tall slender girl with the
  wriggling puppy in her arms. And another thing struck him also, though he
  said nothing. Possibly it was accidental, but the puppy she had picked up,
  and which was now making frantic endeavours to lick her face, was out and
  away the best of the litter. Almost angrily he told himself that it
  <i>was</i> an accident, and yet he could not quite banish the thought that it
  was an accident which would happen every time. Thoroughbred picks
  thoroughbred; instinctively the girl would pick the best. His mouth set a
  little, giving him a look of sternness, and at that moment their eyes met
  over the puppy's head.</p>

  <p>"Is he for sale?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly he was for sale; Desmond Brooke, though he was in no need of
  money, did not believe in running anything save on business lines. But now
  something that he did not stop to analyse made him hesitate. He felt a sudden
  inconsequent distaste against selling the puppy to her.</p>

  <p>"You've picked the best, I see," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered, with the faintest trace of hauteur. Insensibly
  she felt that this man was hostile to her.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that that one is not for sale," he continued. "You can have
  any of the others if you like."</p>

  <p>Abruptly she restored the puppy to its mother.</p>

  <p>"Having chosen the best, Mr Brooke," she said, looking him straight in the
  face, "I don't care about taking anything second-rate."</p>

  <p>For a second or two they stared at one another. Ada Laverton had wandered
  away and was talking shop to the gardener; the Hermit and Lady Cynthia were
  alone.</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," said the Hermit, calmly.</p>

  <p>"That is gratuitously rude," answered the girl quietly. "It is also
  extremely impertinent. And lastly it shows that you are a very bad judge of
  character."</p>

  <p>The man bowed.</p>

  <p>"I sincerely hope that your 'lastly' is true. Am I to understand, then,
  that you do not care to buy one of the other puppies?"</p>

  <p>And suddenly the girl laughed half-angrily.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by daring to say such a thing to me? Why, you haven't
  known me for more than two minutes."</p>

  <p>"That is not strictly true, Lady Cynthia. Anyone who is capable of reading
  and takes in the illustrated papers can claim your acquaintance weekly."</p>

  <p>"I see," she answered. "You disapprove of my poor features being
  reproduced."</p>

  <p>"Personally not at all," he replied. "I know enough of the world, and am
  sufficiently broadminded, I trust, to realise how completely unimportant the
  matter is. Lady Cynthia Stockdale at Ascot, at Goodwood, in her motorcar, out
  of her motorcar, by the fire, by the gas stove, in her boudoir, out of her
  boudoir, in the garden, not in the garden &mdash; and always in a different
  frock every time. It doesn't matter to me, but there are some people who
  haven't got enough money to pay for the doctor's bill when their wives are
  dying. And it's such a comfort to them to see you by the fire. To know that
  half the money you paid for your frock would save the life of the woman they
  love."</p>

  <p>"You're talking like a ranting tub-thumper," she cried, furiously. "How
  dare you say such things to me? And, anyway, does breeding dogs in the
  wilderness help them with their doctors' bills?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Touché</i>," said the man, with a faint smile. "Perhaps I haven't
  expressed myself very clearly. You can't pay the bills, Lady Cynthia &mdash;
  I can't. There are too many thousands to pay. But it's the bitter contrast
  that hits them, and it's all so petty." For a while he paused, seeming to
  seek for his words. "Come with me, Lady Cynthia, and I'll show you
  something."</p>

  <p>Almost violently he swung round on his heel and strode off towards the
  house. For a moment she hesitated, then she followed him slowly. Anger and
  indignation were seething in her mind; the monstrous impertinence of this
  complete stranger was almost bewildering. She found him standing in his
  smoking room unlocking a drawer in a big writing desk.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said uncompromisingly from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I have something to show you," he remarked quietly. "But before I show it
  to you, I want to tell you a very short story. Three years ago I was in the
  back of beyond in Brazil. I'd got a bad dose of fever, and the gassing I got
  in France wasn't helping matters. It was touch and go whether I pulled
  through or not. And one day one of the fellows got a two-month-old
  <i>Tatler</i>. In that <i>Tatler</i> was a picture &mdash; a picture of the
  loveliest girl I have ever seen. I tore it out, and I propped it up at the
  foot of my bed. I think I worshipped it; I certainly fell in love with it.
  There is the picture."</p>

  <p>He handed it to her, and she looked at it in silence. It was of herself,
  and after a moment or two she raised her eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she said gently.</p>

  <p>"A few months ago I came back to England. I found a seething cauldron of
  discontent; men out of work &mdash; strikes &mdash; talk of revolution. And
  this was the country for which a million of our best had died. I also found
  &mdash; week after week &mdash; my picture girl displayed in every paper, as
  if no such thing as trouble existed. She, in her motorcar, cared for none of
  these things."</p>

  <p>"That is unjust," said the girl, and her voice was low.</p>

  <p>"I knew it was unjust," answered the man, "but I couldn't help it. And if
  I couldn't help it &mdash; I who loved her &mdash; what of these others? It
  seemed symbolical to me."</p>

  <p>"Nero fiddling," said the girl, with a faint smile. "You're rather a
  strange person, Mr Brooke. Am I to understand that you're in love with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"You are not. I'm in love with the you of that picture."</p>

  <p>"I see. You have set up an image. And supposing that image is a true
  one."</p>

  <p>"Need we discuss that?" said the man, with faint sarcasm.</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The supposition is at least as possible as that you are doing any vast
  amount of good for the seething cauldron of discontent, I think you called
  it, by breeding Aberdeens in the country. I'm afraid you're a crank, Mr
  Brooke, and not a very consistent one at that. And a crank is to my mind
  synonymous with a bore."</p>

  <p>The man replaced the picture in his desk.</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps we had better join Mrs Laverton," he remarked. "I apologise
  for having wearied you."</p>

  <p>In silence they went out into the garden, to find Ada Laverton wandering
  aimlessly round looking for them.</p>

  <p>"Where have you two been?" she demanded, as she saw them approaching.</p>

  <p>"Mr Brooke has been showing me a relic of his past," said Lady Cynthia.
  "Most interesting and touching. Are you ready to go, Ada?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Laverton gave a quick glance at their two faces, and wondered what had
  happened. Not much, surely, in so short a time &mdash; and yet with Cynthia
  you never could tell. The Hermit's face, usually so inscrutable, showed
  traces of suppressed feeling; Cynthia's was rather too expressionless.</p>

  <p>"Are you coming to the ball tomorrow night, Hermit?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know there was one on, Mrs Laverton," he answered.</p>

  <p>"The cricket ball, my good man," she exclaimed. "It's been advertised for
  the last month."</p>

  <p>"But surely Mr Brooke doesn't countenance anything so frivolous as
  dancing?" remarked Lady Cynthia. "After the lecture he has just given me on
  my personal deportment the idea is out of the question."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless I propose to come, Lady Cynthia," said Brooke quietly. "You
  must forgive me if I have allowed my feelings to run away with me today. And
  perhaps tomorrow you will allow me to find out if the new image is correct
  &mdash; or a pose also."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the girl, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"'Lady Cynthia Stockdale &mdash; possibly the best dancer in London,' " he
  quoted mockingly; "I forget which of the many papers I saw it in."</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to pass judgment on my dancing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you will be good enough to give me a dance."</p>

  <p>For a moment words failed her. The cool, the sublime impertinence of this
  man literally choked her. Then she nodded briefly.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a dance if you're there in time. And then you can test for
  yourself, if you're capable of testing."</p>

  <p>He bowed without a word, and stood watching them as they walked down the
  lane.</p>

  <p>"I think, Ada, that he's the most detestable man I've ever met," remarked
  Lady Cynthia furiously, as they turned into the main road.</p>

  <p>And Ada Laverton said nothing, but wondered the more.</p>

  <p align="center">III</p>

  <p>She saw him as soon as she got into the ballroom. It was the last day but
  one of the local cricket week, and the room was crowded. A large number of
  the men she knew &mdash; men she had danced with in London who had come down
  to play &mdash; and within half a minute she was surrounded. It was a chance
  of getting a dance with her which was not to be missed; in London she
  generally danced with one or at the most two men for the whole evening
  &mdash; men who were absolutely perfect performers. For dancing was a part of
  Lady Cynthia's life &mdash; and a big part.</p>

  <p>The humour of the situation had struck her that day. For this dog-
  breeding crank to presume to judge her powers of dancing seemed too sublimely
  funny for annoyance. But he deserved to be taught a very considerable lesson.
  And she proposed to teach him. After that she proposed to dismiss him
  completely from her mind.</p>

  <p>She gave him a cool nod as he came up, and frowned slightly as she noticed
  the faint glint of laughter in his eyes. Really Mr Desmond Brooke was a
  little above himself. So much the worse for him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you'll find one or not," she remarked carelessly,
  handing him her programme.</p>

  <p>He glanced at it without a word, and quietly erased someone's name.</p>

  <p>"I've made special arrangements with the band for Number 9, Lady Cynthia,"
  he remarked coolly. "A lot of people will be in at supper then, so we ought
  to have the floor more to ourselves."</p>

  <p>The next instant he had bowed and disappeared, leaving her staring
  speechlessly at her programme.</p>

  <p>"A breezy customer," murmured a man beside her. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"A gentleman who is going to have the biggest lesson of his life," she
  answered ominously, and the man laughed. He knew Lady Cynthia &mdash; and he
  knew Lady Cynthia's temper when it was roused. But for once he was wrong in
  his diagnosis; the outward and visible were there all right &mdash; the
  inward and mental state of affairs in keeping with them was not. For the
  first time in her life Lady Cynthia felt at a loss. Her partners found her
  <i>distraite</i> and silent; as a matter of fact she was barely conscious of
  their existence. And the more she lashed at herself mentally, the more
  confused did she get.</p>

  <p>It was preposterous, impossible. Why should she cut Tubby Dawlish to dance
  with a crank who kept dogs? A crank, moreover, who openly avowed that his
  object was to see if she could dance. Every now and then she saw him lounging
  by the door watching her. She knew he was watching her, though she gave no
  sign of being aware of his existence. And all the while Number 9 grew
  inexorably nearer.</p>

  <p>Dance indeed! She would show him how she could dance. And as a result she
  fell into the deadly fault of trying. No perfect dancer ever <i>tries</i> to
  dance; they just dance. And Lady Cynthia knew that better than most people.
  Which made her fury rise still more against the man standing just outside the
  door smoking a cigarette. A thousand times &mdash; no; she would not cut
  Tubby.</p>

  <p>And then she realised that people were moving in to supper; that the 8 was
  being taken down from the band platform &mdash; that 9 was being put up. And
  she realised that Desmond Brooke the Hermit was crossing the room towards
  her; was standing by her side while Tubby &mdash; like an outraged terrier
  &mdash; was glaring at him across her.</p>

  <p>"This is mine, old thing," spluttered Tubby. "Number 9."</p>

  <p>"I think not," said the Hermit quietly. "I fixed Number 9 especially with
  Lady Cynthia yesterday."</p>

  <p>She hesitated &mdash; and was lost.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Tubby," she said a little weakly. "I forgot."</p>

  <p>Not a trace of triumph showed on the Hermit's face, as he gravely watched
  the indignant back of his rival retreating towards the door: not a trace of
  expression showed on his face as he turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"You've been trying tonight, Lady Cynthia," he said gravely. "Please don't
  &mdash; this time. It's a wonderful tune this &mdash; half waltz, half tango.
  It was lucky finding Lopez conducting: he has played for me before. And I
  want you just to forget everything except the smell of the passion flowers
  coming in through the open windows, and the thrumming of the guitars played
  by the natives under the palm trees." His eyes were looking into hers, and
  suddenly she drew a deep breath. Things had got beyond her.</p>

  <p>It was marked as a foxtrot on the programme, and several of the more
  enthusiastic performers were waiting to get off on the stroke of time. But as
  the first haunting notes of the dance wailed out &mdash; they paused and
  hesitated. This was no foxtrot; this was &mdash; but what matter what it was?
  For after the first bar no one moved in the room: they stood motionless
  watching one couple &mdash; Lady Cynthia Stockdale and an unknown man.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's the fellow who breeds dogs," muttered someone to his partner,
  but there was no reply. She was too engrossed in watching.</p>

  <p>And as for Lady Cynthia, from the moment she felt Desmond Brooke's arm
  round her, the world had become merely movement &mdash; such movement as she
  had never thought of before. To say that he was a perfect dancer would be
  idle: he was dancing itself. And the band, playing as men possessed, played
  for them and them only. Everything was forgotten: nothing in the world
  mattered save that they should go on and on and on &mdash; dancing. She was
  utterly unconscious of the crowd of onlookers: she didn't know that people
  had left the supper room and were thronging in at the door: she knew nothing
  save that she had never danced before. Dimly she realised at last that the
  music had stopped: dimly she heard a great roar of applause &mdash; but only
  dimly. It seemed to come from far away &mdash; the shouts of "Encore" seemed
  hazy and dreamlike. They had left the ballroom, though she was hardly
  conscious of where he was taking her, and when he turned to her and said,
  "Get a wrap or something: I want to talk to you out in God's fresh air," she
  obeyed him without a word. He was waiting for her when she returned, standing
  motionless where she had left him. And still in silence he led the way to his
  car which had been left apart from all the others, almost as if he had
  expected to want it before the end. For a moment she hesitated, for Lady
  Cynthia, though utterly unconventional, was no fool.</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me?" he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Up to the cliffs beyond my house. It will take ten minutes &mdash; and I
  want to talk to you with the sound of the sea below us."</p>

  <p>"You had the car in readiness?" she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"For both of us &mdash; or for me alone," he answered. "If you won't come,
  then I go home. Will you come with me?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I will come."</p>

  <p>He helped her into the car and wrapped a rug round her; then he climbed in
  beside her. And as they swung out of the little square, the strains of the
  next dance followed them from the open windows of the Town Hall.</p>

  <p>He drove as he danced &mdash; perfectly; and in the dim light the girl
  watched his clear-cut profile as he stared ahead into the glare of the
  headlights. Away to the right his farm flashed by, the last house before they
  reached the top of the cliffs. And gradually, above the thrumming of the
  engine, she heard the lazy boom of the big Atlantic swell on the rocks ahead.
  At last he stopped where the road ran parallel to the top of the cliff, and
  switched off the lights.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, a little mockingly, "is the new image correct or a
  pose?"</p>

  <p>"You dance divinely," he answered gravely. "More divinely than any woman I
  have ever danced with, and I have danced with those who are reputed to be the
  show dancers of the world. But I didn't ask you to come here to talk about
  dancing; I asked you to come here in order that I might first apologise, and
  then say goodbye."</p>

  <p>The girl gave a little start, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I talked a good deal of rot to you yesterday," he went on, after a
  moment. "You were justified in calling me a ranting tub-thumper. But I was
  angry with myself, and when one is angry with oneself one does foolish
  things. I know as well as you do just how little society photographs mean:
  that was only a peg to hang my inexcusable tirade on. You see, when one has
  fallen in love with an ideal &mdash; as I fell in love with that picture of
  you, all in white in the garden at your father's place &mdash; and you
  treasure that ideal for three years, it jolts one to find that the ideal is
  different to what you thought. I fell in love with a girl in white, and
  sometimes in the wilds I've seen visions and dreamed dreams. And then I found
  her a lovely being in Paquin's most expensive frocks; a social celebrity: a
  household name. And then I met her, and knew my girl in white had gone. What
  matter that it was the inexorable rule of Nature that she must go: what
  matter that she had changed into an incredibly lovely woman? She had gone: my
  dream girl had vanished. In her place stood Lady Cynthia Stockdale &mdash;
  the well-known society beauty. Reality had come &mdash; and I was angry with
  you for having killed my dream &mdash; angry with myself for having to wake
  up.</p>

  <p>"Such is my apology," he continued gravely. "Perhaps you will understand:
  I think you will understand. And just because I was angry with you, I made
  you dance with me tonight. I said to myself: 'I will show Lady Cynthia
  Stockdale that the man who loved the girl in white can meet her successor on
  her own ground.' That's the idea I started with, but things went wrong
  halfway through the dance. The anger died; in its place there came something
  else. Even my love for the girl in white seemed to become a bit hazy; I found
  that the successor had supplanted her more completely than I realised. And
  since the successor has the world at her feet &mdash; why, the breeder of
  dogs will efface himself, for his own peace of mind. So, goodbye, Lady
  Cynthia &mdash; and the very best of luck. If it won't bore you I may say
  that I'm not really a breeder of dogs by profession. This is just an
  interlude; a bit of rest spent with the most wonderful pals in the world. I'm
  getting back to harness soon: voluntary harness, I'm glad to say, as the
  shekels don't matter. But anything one can do towards greasing the wheels,
  and helping those priceless fellows who gave everything without a murmur
  during the war, and who are up against it now &mdash; is worth doing."</p>

  <p>And still she said nothing, while he backed the car on to the grass beside
  the road, and turned it the way they had come. A jumble of strange thoughts
  were in her mind; a jumble out of which there stuck one dominant thing
  &mdash; the brown tanned face of the man beside her. And when he stopped the
  car by his own farm and left her without a word of apology, she sat quite
  motionless staring at the white streak of road in front. At last she heard
  his footsteps coming back along the drive, and suddenly a warm wriggling
  bundle was placed in her lap &mdash; a bundle which slobbered joyfully and
  then fell on the floor with an indignant yelp.</p>

  <p>"The puppy," he said quietly. "Please take him." And very softly under his
  breath he added: "The best to the best."</p>

  <p>But she heard him, and even as she stooped to lift the puppy on to her
  knees, her heart began to beat madly. She knew: at last, she knew.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you back to the dance," he was saying, "and afterwards I'll
  deposit that young rascal at Mrs Laverton's house."</p>

  <p>And then for the first time she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Please go to Ada's house first. Afterwards we'll see about the
  dance."</p>

  <p>He bowed and swung the car left-handed through the lodge gates.</p>

  <p>"Will you wait for me?" she said, as he pulled up at the front door.</p>

  <p>"As long as you like," he answered courteously.</p>

  <p>"Because I may be some time," she continued a little unevenly. "And don't
  wait for me here: wait for me where the drive runs through that little copse,
  halfway down to the lodge."</p>

  <p>The next instant she had disappeared into the house, with the puppy in her
  arms. Why by the little copse? wondered the man as he slowly drove the car
  down the drive. The butler had seen them already, so what did it matter? He
  pulled up the car in the shadow of a big oak tree, and lit a cigarette. Then,
  with his arms resting on the steering wheel, he sat staring in front of him.
  He had done a mad thing, and she'd taken it wonderfully well. He always had
  done mad things all his life; he was made that way. But this was the maddest
  he had ever done. With a grim smile he pictured her infuriated partners,
  waiting in serried rows by the door, cursing him by all their gods. And then
  the smile faded, and he sighed, while his knuckles gleamed white on the
  wheel. If only she wasn't so gloriously pretty; if only she wasn't so utterly
  alive and wonderful. Well &mdash; it was the penalty of playing with fire;
  and it had been worth it. Yes; it had been worth it &mdash; even if the wound
  never quite healed.</p>

  <p>"<i>A fool there was, and he made his prayer</i>..."</p>

  <p>He pitched his cigarette away, and suddenly he stiffened and sat
  motionless, while something seemed to rise in his throat and choke him, and
  the blood hammered hotly at his temples. A girl in white was standing not
  five feet from him on the fringe of the little wood: a girl holding a puppy
  in her arms. And then he heard her speaking.</p>

  <p>"It's not the same frock &mdash; but it's the nearest I can do."</p>

  <p>She came up to the car, and once again over the head of the puppy their
  eyes met.</p>

  <p>"I've been looking," she said steadily, "for the real thing. I don't
  <i>think</i> I've found it &mdash; I <i>know</i> I have."</p>

  <p>"My dear!" he stammered hoarsely. "Oh! my dear dream girl."</p>

  <p>"Take me back to the cliff, Desmond," she whispered. "Take me back to our
  cliff."</p>

  <p>And an outraged puppy, bouncing off the running board on to a stray fir
  cone, viewed the proceedings of the next five minutes with silent
  displeasure.</p>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11">XI. &mdash; A GLASS OF WHISKY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"It's as easy as shelling peas to be a detective in
fiction," grunted the
  Barrister. "He's merely the author of the yarn disguised as a character, and
  he knows the solution before he starts."</p>

  <p>"But the reader doesn't, if the story is told well," objected the Doctor.
  "And that's all that matters."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I grant you that," said the Barrister, lighting a cigar. "I'm not
  inveighing against the detective story &mdash; I love 'em. All I'm saying is
  that in life a detective's job is a very different matter to &mdash; well,
  take the illustrious example &mdash; to that of Sherlock Holmes. He's got to
  make the crime fit to the clues, not the clues fit into the crime. It's not
  so terribly difficult to reconstruct the murder of the Prime Minister from a
  piece of charred paper discovered in the railway refreshment room at Bath
  &mdash; in fiction; it's altogether a different matter in reality."</p>

  <p>The Soldier thoughtfully filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"And yet there have been many cases when the reconstruction has been made
  on some clue almost equally 'flimsy'," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"A few," conceded the Barrister. "But nine out of ten are built up with
  laborious care. The structure does not rest on any one fact &mdash; but on a
  whole lot of apparently unimportant and trivial ones. Of course it's more
  spectacular to bring a man to the gallows because half a brick was found
  lying on the front doorstep, but in practice it doesn't happen."</p>

  <p>"It does &mdash; sometimes," remarked a quiet, sandy-haired man who was
  helping himself to a whisky-and-soda. "It does sometimes, you man of law.
  Your remarks coupled with my present occupation remind me of just such a
  case."</p>

  <p>"Your present occupation appears to be drinking whisky," said the Doctor,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," returned the other. "Almost as prosaic a thing as our legal
  luminary's half-brick." He settled himself comfortably in a chair, and the
  others leaned forward expectantly. "And yet on that very ordinary pastime
  hinged an extremely interesting case: one in which I was lucky enough to play
  a principal part."</p>

  <p>"The night is yet young, old man," said the Barrister. "It's up to you to
  prove your words, and duly confound me."</p>

  <p>The sandy-haired man took a sip of his drink: then he put the glass on the
  table beside him and began.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it won't bore you, I'm agreeable. I'll tell you the whole thing
  exactly as it took place, only altering the names of the people involved. It
  happened before the war &mdash; in that hot summer of 1911, to be exact. I'd
  been working pretty hard in London, and about the end of July I got an
  invitation to go down and stop with some people in Devonshire. I will call
  them the Marleys, and they lived just outside a small village on the north
  coast. The family consisted of old Marley, who was a man rising sixty, and
  his two daughters, Joan and Hilda. There was also Jack Fairfax, through whom,
  as a matter of fact, I had first got to know them.</p>

  <p>"Jack was about my own age &mdash; thirty odd, and we'd been up at
  Cambridge together. He was no relation to old Marley, but he was an orphan,
  and Marley was his guardian, or had been when Jack was a youngster. And from
  the very first Jack and the old man had not got on.</p>

  <p>"Marley was not everybody's meat, by a long way &mdash; rather a queer-
  tempered, secretive blighter; and Jack Fairfax had the devil of a temper at
  times. When he was a boy he had no alternative except to do as his guardian
  told him, but even in those early days, as I gathered subsequently, there had
  been frequent storms. And, when he came down from Cambridge there were two or
  three most unholy rows which culminated in Jack leaving the house for
  good.</p>

  <p>"It was apparently this severance from the two girls, whom he had more or
  less regarded as sisters, which caused the next bust-up. And this one,
  according to Jack, was in the nature of a volcanic eruption. The two girls
  had come up to London to go through the season with some aunt, and Jack had
  seen a good deal of them with the net result that he and Joan had fallen in
  love with each other. Then the fat was in the fire. Jack straightway had gone
  down to Devonshire to ask old Marley's consent: old Marley had replied in
  terms which, judging from Jack's account of the interview, had contained a
  positive profusion of un-Parliamentary epithets. Jack had lost his temper
  properly &mdash; and, well, you know, the usual thing. At any rate, the long
  and the short of it was that old Marley had recalled both his daughters from
  London, and had sworn that if he ever saw Jack near the house again he'd
  pepper him with a shotgun. To which Jack had replied that only his grey hairs
  and his gout saved Mr Marley from the biggest hiding he'd ever had in his
  life &mdash; even if not the biggest he deserved. With which genial exchange
  of playful badinage I gathered the interview ended. And that was how matters
  stood when I went down in July, 1911.</p>

  <p>"For some peculiar reason the old man liked me, even though I was a friend
  of Jack's. And in many ways I quite liked him, though there was always
  something about him which defeated me. Of course, he had a foul temper
  &mdash; but it wasn't altogether that. He seemed to me at times to be in fear
  of something or somebody; and yet, though I say that now, I don't know that I
  went as far as thinking so at the time. It was an almost indefinable
  impression &mdash; vague and yet very real.</p>

  <p>"The two girls were perfectly charming, though they were both a little
  afraid of their father. How long it would have taken Joan to overcome this
  timidity, and go to Jack without her father's consent, I don't know. And
  incidentally, as our legislators say, the question did not arise. Fate held
  the ace of trumps, and proceeded to deal it during my visit."</p>

  <p>The sandy-haired man leant back in his chair and crossed his legs
  deliberately.</p>

  <p>"I think it was about the fourth day after I arrived (he went on, after a
  while) that the tragedy happened. We were sitting in the drawing room after
  dinner &mdash; a couple of men whose names I forget, and a girlfriend of
  Hilda's. Hilda herself was there, and Joan, who seemed very preoccupied, had
  come in about a quarter of an hour previously. I had noticed that Hilda had
  looked at her sister inquiringly as she entered, and that Joan had shrugged
  her shoulders. But nothing had been said, and naturally I asked no questions
  with the others there, though from the air of suppressed excitement on Joan's
  face I knew there was something in the wind.</p>

  <p>"Old Marley himself was not with us: he was in his study at the other end
  of the house. The fact was not at all unusual: he frequently retired to his
  own den after dinner, sometimes joining the rest of the party for a few
  minutes before going to bed, more often not appearing again till the
  following morning. And so we all sat there talking idly, with the windows
  wide open and the light shining out on to the lawn. It must have been
  somewhere about ten to a quarter past when suddenly Hilda gave a little
  scream.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want?' she cried. 'Who are you?'</p>

  <p>"I swung round in my chair, to find a man standing on the lawn outside, in
  the centre of the light. He was facing us, and as we stared at him he came
  nearer till he was almost in the room. And the first thing that struck me was
  that he looked a little agitated.</p>

  <p>"'You will excuse me appearing like this,' he said, 'but&mdash;' He broke
  off and looked at me. 'Might I have a word with you alone, sir?'</p>

  <p>"I glanced at the others: obviously he was a stranger. No trace of
  recognition appeared on anyone's face, and I began to feel a little
  suspicious.</p>

  <p>"'What is it?' I cried. 'What can you possibly want to speak to me about
  that you can't say now?'</p>

  <p>"He shrugged his shoulders slightly. 'As you will,' he answered. 'My idea
  was to avoid frightening the ladies. In the room at the other end of the
  house a man has been murdered.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment everyone was too thunderstruck to reply; then Hilda gave a
  choking cry.</p>

  <p>"'What sort of a man?' she said, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"'An elderly man of, I should think, about sixty,' returned the other,
  gravely, and Hilda buried her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>"'I will come with you at once, sir,' I said, hurriedly, and the two other
  men rose. Instinctively, I think, we all knew it must be old Marley: there
  was no one else it could be. But the sudden shock of it had dazed us all. I
  glanced at Joan. She was staring at the man like a girl bereft of her senses,
  and I put my hand reassuringly on her shoulder. And then she looked up at me,
  and the expression in her eyes pulled me together. It was like a cold douche,
  and it acted instantaneously. Because it wasn't horror or dazed stupefaction
  that I read on her face: it was terror &mdash; agonised terror. And suddenly
  I remembered her air of suppressed excitement earlier in the evening."</p>

  <p>Once again the sandy-haired man paused while the others waited in silence
  for him to continue.</p>

  <p>"It was old Marley right enough (he went on quietly). We walked round the
  front of the house until we came to the window of his study, and there
  instinctively we paused. The window was open, and he was sitting at his desk
  quite motionless. His head had fallen forward, and on his face was a look of
  dreadful fear.</p>

  <p>"For a while none of us moved. Then, with an effort, I threw my leg over
  the window sill and entered.</p>

  <p>"'He's quite dead,' I said, and I felt my voice was shaking. 'We'd better
  send for the police.'</p>

  <p>"The others nodded, and in silence I picked up the telephone.</p>

  <p>"'Mr Marley's been killed,' I heard myself saying. 'Will you send someone
  up at once?'</p>

  <p>"And then for the first time I noticed the poker lying beside the chair,
  and saw the back of the old man's head. It wasn't a pretty sight, and one of
  the other men staying in the house &mdash; a youngster &mdash; turned very
  white, and went to the window.</p>

  <p>"'Pretty obvious how it was done,' said the stranger, quietly. 'Well,
  gentlemen, nothing ought to be touched in this room until the police arrive.
  I suggest that we should draw the curtains and go somewhere else to wait for
  them.'</p>

  <p>"I don't think any of us were sorry to fall in with his suggestion. I also
  don't think I've ever drunk such a large whisky-and-soda as I did a few
  minutes later. Discovering the body had been bad enough: breaking the news to
  the two girls was going to be worse.</p>

  <p>"It was Joan who met me in the hall &mdash; and we stared at one another
  in silence. Then I nodded my head stupidly.</p>

  <p>"'It's father,' she whispered. 'Oh, my God!'</p>

  <p>"I put out my hand to steady her, and she was looking at me with a fixed
  stare.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you understand?' she muttered, hoarsely, and swallowing all the
  time. 'Don't you understand? Jack has been here tonight.'</p>

  <p>"'Jack!' I looked at her foolishly. 'Jack!'</p>

  <p>"And then her full meaning struck me.</p>

  <p>"'How did that man find out?' she whispered. 'And who is he?'</p>

  <p>"'I don't know. I'll go and ask him.' I was still trying to adjust to this
  new development &mdash; and her next words seemed to come from a great
  distance.</p>

  <p>"'Do something. For God's sake &mdash; do something.'</p>

  <p>"Then she turned and left me, and I watched her go up the stairs, walking
  stiffly and clinging to the banisters.</p>

  <p>"So Jack had been there! And old Marley was dead! Murdered! Hit on the
  head with a poker. And Jack had been there. It's only in romantic fiction
  that the reader is expected to assume the impossibility of the hero
  committing a crime, owing to the extreme beauty of his nature. And this
  wasn't romantic fiction. It was hard, brutal reality. The two facts stood
  there, side by side, in all their dazzling simplicity. Jack's nature was not
  supremely beautiful. He was an ordinary man, with the devil of a temper when
  it was roused.</p>

  <p>"Mechanically I started to walk back to the room where I had left the
  other three men. They were sitting in silence when I entered, and after a
  while the stranger got up.</p>

  <p>"'A dreadful thing to happen,' he said, gravely.</p>

  <p>"'May I ask, sir,' I began, 'how you came to discover it?'</p>

  <p>"'Very simply,' he answered. 'I was strolling along the road, going back
  to the village inn where I have been stopping for two or three nights, when I
  saw the window of the room through the trees. The light was shining out, and
  I could see someone sitting at the desk. More out of idle curiosity than
  anything else, I paused for a moment or two, and then something began to
  arouse my suspicions. The man at the desk seemed so motionless. I thought
  perhaps he had fainted, or was ill, and after a little hesitation I went in
  at the gate and looked through the window. To my horror I saw he was dead
  &mdash; and I at once came round to the other room from which the light was
  shining, and where I found you.'</p>

  <p>"'There is a point which may have some bearing on the crime,' he
  continued, after a pause. 'On my way up from the inn a man passed me. He was
  coming from this direction, and seemed to me to be in a very excited
  condition. It was his obvious agitation that made me notice him at the time,
  though in the dim light I couldn't see his face very clearly. But he was
  swinging his stick in the air, and muttering to himself. At the moment I
  didn't think much about it. But now&mdash;' He shrugged his shoulders
  slightly. 'Of course, I may be completely wrong, but I think it is a thing
  worth mentioning to the police.'</p>

  <p>"'Would you know the man again?' I asked, trying to speak quite
  normally.</p>

  <p>"'Well, he was tall &mdash; six feet at least &mdash; and broad. And he
  was clean-shaven.' He spoke thoughtfully, weighing his words. 'I might know
  him again &mdash; but I wouldn't swear to it. One has to be doubly careful if
  a man's life is at stake.'</p>

  <p>"I turned away abruptly. Jack was tall and broad and clean-shaven. Strive
  as I would, the deadly suspicion was beginning to grip me that Jack, in a fit
  of ungovernable passion, had killed the old man. And at such moments,
  whatever may be the legal aspect of the matter, one's main idea is how best
  to help a pal. If Jack had indeed done it, what was the best thing to do?</p>

  <p>"I rang the bell, and told the scared-looking maid to bring the whisky and
  some glasses. Then, with a muttered apology, I left the room. I felt I wanted
  to talk to Joan about it. I found her dry-eyed and quite composed, though she
  was evidently holding herself under control with a great effort. And briefly
  I told her what the stranger had said.</p>

  <p>"She heard me out in silence: then she spoke with a quiet assurance that
  surprised me.</p>

  <p>"'If Jack did it,' she said, 'he doesn't know he's done it. He doesn't
  know he's killed &mdash; father.' She faltered a bit over the last word, and
  I didn't interrupt. 'What I mean is this,' she went on after a moment. 'I
  know Jack &mdash; better than anyone else. I know those rages of his &mdash;
  when he sees red. But they're over in a minute. He's capable of anything for
  a second or two, but if he'd done it, Hugh, if he'd hit father &mdash; and
  killed him &mdash; his remorse would have been dreadful. He wouldn't have run
  away: I'm certain of that. That's why I say that if Jack did it he doesn't
  know &mdash; he killed him.'</p>

  <p>"I said nothing: there was no good telling her that it wasn't one blow,
  nor yet two or three, that had been used. There was no good telling her that
  it was no accidental thing done unwittingly in the heat of the moment &mdash;
  that it was an absolute impossibility for the man who had done it to be in
  ignorance of the fact. And yet, though I realised all that, her simple
  conviction put new hope into me. Illogical, I admit, but I went downstairs
  feeling more confident.</p>

  <p>"I found that the local police had arrived &mdash; a sergeant and an
  ordinary constable &mdash; and had already begun their investigations. The
  principal evidence, of course, came from the stranger, and he repeated to
  them what he had already told me. His name apparently was Lenham &mdash;
  Victor Lenham &mdash; and the police knew he had been stopping at the local
  inn.</p>

  <p>"'You saw the body through the window, sir,' said the sergeant, 'and then
  went round to the drawing room?'</p>

  <p>"'That is so, sergeant.'</p>

  <p>"'You didn't go into the room?'</p>

  <p>"'Not until later &mdash; with these gentlemen. You see,' he added, 'I've
  seen death too often not to recognise it. And as, in a way, you will
  understand, it was no concern of mine, I thought it advisable to have some
  member of the house itself with me before entering the room.'</p>

  <p>"'Quite, sir, quite.' The sergeant nodded portentously. 'Is there anything
  else you can tell us?'</p>

  <p>"'Well,' said Lenham, 'there is a point, which I have already mentioned to
  this gentleman.' He glanced at me, and then, turning back to the sergeant, he
  told him about the man he had passed on the road. And it was when he came to
  the description that suddenly the constable gave a whistle of excitement. The
  sergeant frowned on him angrily, but the worthy PC, whose only experience of
  crime up-to-date had been assisting inebriated villagers home, had quite lost
  his head.</p>

  <p>"'Mr Fairfax, sergeant,' he exploded. ''E was down here tonight. Caught
  the last train, 'e did. Jenkins at the station told me &mdash; sure
  thing.'</p>

  <p>"'Good heavens, sergeant!' I said angrily, 'what the devil is the man
  talking about? He surely doesn't suppose that Mr Fairfax had anything to do
  with it?'</p>

  <p>"But the mischief was done. The sergeant formally told off his indiscreet
  subordinate, but it was obvious that it was merely an official rebuke. In a
  village like that everybody knows everybody else's private affairs, and the
  strained relations between the dead man and Jack Fairfax were common
  property. I could see at a glance that the sergeant regarded the matter as
  solved already.</p>

  <p>"'Would you recognise this man again, sir?' he demanded, and Lenham gave
  him the same guarded reply as he had already given to me. He might &mdash;
  but he wouldn't swear to it. It was impossible to be too careful in such a
  case, he repeated, and it was practically dark when he had passed the
  man.</p>

  <p>"It was all duly noted down, and then we adjourned to the room of the
  tragedy. The constable &mdash; a ruddy-faced young man &mdash; turned pale
  when he saw the body; then he pulled himself together and assisted the
  sergeant in his formal examination. I didn't blame him &mdash; we were all
  feeling the strain, somewhat naturally. Lenham seemed the least concerned,
  but it wasn't a personal matter with him as it was with us, especially with
  me. All the time I was fidgeting round the room, subconsciously watching the
  stolid sergeant making notes, but with only one thought dominating my brain
  &mdash; how best to help Jack. Not that I had definitely made up my mind that
  he'd done it, but even at that stage of the proceedings I realised that
  appearances were against him. And Joan's words were ringing in my head
  &mdash; 'For God's sake &mdash; do something.'</p>

  <p>"After a while I crossed the room to a small table on which a tantalus of
  whisky and two glasses were standing. I looked at the tray with unseeing eyes
  &mdash; an Indian silver one, which old Marley had been very proud of. And
  then mechanically I picked up the glasses. I don't know why I did so; the
  action was, as I say, mechanical. They had been used &mdash; both of them:
  they had been used for whisky &mdash; one could tell that by the smell. And
  when I put the glasses down again on the tray, the sergeant was approaching
  with his notebook."</p>

  <p>The sandy-haired man paused, with a reminiscent smile.</p>

  <p>"Ever noticed how extraordinarily dense you can be at times, even with a
  plain fact staring you straight in the face? There was one staring at me for
  ten minutes that night before my grey matter began to stir."</p>

  <p>"Just hold on a minute," interrupted the Barrister. "Is this plain fact
  staring us in the face now?"</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," conceded the narrator. "At the moment you are in the
  position of the other people in that room. Mind you, I've left out nothing in
  order to mystify you; the story, as I have given it to you, is a plain
  unvarnished account of what took place. But I'm out to disprove your
  half-brick theory, lawyer-man, and to do so with such little story-telling
  ability as I happen to possess.</p>

  <p>"Now, I won't weary you with what happened during the next week, beyond
  saying that an inquest and a burglary took place. And the latter, at any
  rate, was very successful. The former moved along obvious lines, and resulted
  in Jack Fairfax being arrested for the wilful murder of his guardian, Roger
  Marley. The evidence was purely circumstantial, but it was about as damning
  as it could be. Jack admitted to having had an interview with Marley that
  night; he admitted that they had had an appalling quarrel. What was even
  worse was that he admitted to having struck the old man in a furious fit of
  rage, but beyond that he denied everything. He absolutely swore that the blow
  he struck Marley could not have killed him; further, that he had never
  handled the poker. And then, a fingerprint expert proved that he had. That
  was the worst shock of the lot, and his explanation given afterwards that,
  now he came to think of it, he had picked up the poker to ram the tobacco
  down in his pipe convinced no one. He indignantly denied that his action in
  going up to London by the last train was in any sense running away; he had
  intended all along to go up by that train. And his reason for leaving the
  house after the interview without attempting to see his fiancée was that he
  was in such a rage with her father that he couldn't trust himself to speak to
  her for fear of what he might say.</p>

  <p>"So much for Jack Fairfax's case &mdash; pretty black, as you will agree.
  In fact, I don't think I should be exaggerating if I said that there were
  only two people in England convinced of his innocence. And he was one of
  them. Even Joan's faith was shaken, a little.</p>

  <p>"It was on the tenth day after the inquest that I rang up the inspector
  who had come over from Exeter to look into the case, with a request that he
  would come up to the house. I told him that I had certain information which
  might interest him and suggested that he might care to hear it. I also rang
  up Lenham at the inn, and asked him if he would mind coming along at the same
  time. I told him I'd discovered the burglar. By the way, I didn't tell you
  that it was his room that had been burgled.</p>

  <p>"In about half an hour they arrived, and the local sergeant as well.</p>

  <p>"'What's this about my burglar?' laughed Lenham. 'A funny fellow &mdash;
  because as far as I can see he didn't take anything.'</p>

  <p>"'All in good time,' I answered, smiling. 'I've found out a lot of strange
  things in town.'</p>

  <p>"Lenham looked at me quickly. 'Oh! have you been to London?' he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I answered, 'for two days. Most entertaining.'</p>

  <p>"And then the inspector chipped in, impatiently: "'Well, sir, what is it
  you want to say to me?' He looked at his watch suggestively.</p>

  <p>"'First of all, inspector,' I said, quietly, 'I want to ask you a
  question. Have you ever heard the legal maxim, <i>Falsus in uno, falsus in
  omne</i>?'</p>

  <p>"I could see that he hadn't the faintest idea what I was driving at. I
  could also see that Lenham's eyes had suddenly become strained.</p>

  <p>"'It means,' I went on, 'that if a witness &mdash; let us say &mdash; is
  proved to have told one lie, there is strong presumptive evidence that he has
  told several. At any rate, the value of his statement is greatly diminished.
  Do you agree?'</p>

  <p>"'Certainly,' he answered. 'But I don't see&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'You will shortly, inspector,' I remarked. 'Now who would you consider
  the principal witness against Mr Fairfax?'</p>

  <p>"'Mr Fairfax himself,' said the inspector, promptly.</p>

  <p>"'And leaving him out?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'Well &mdash; I suppose &mdash; this gentleman here.' He nodded towards
  Lenham, who was sitting quite motionless, watching me.</p>

  <p>"'Precisely,' I murmured. 'Then why was it necessary for Mr Lenham to
  state that his name was Lenham, and further to swear that he had never seen
  Mr Marley before &mdash; when both those statements were lies?'</p>

  <p>"'What the devil do you mean?' snarled Lenham, rising from his chair.
  'What do you mean by saying my name is not Lenham?'</p>

  <p>"'You wanted to know about the burglar who took nothing, didn't you?' I
  said, grimly. 'Well &mdash; I was the burglar, and I took something very
  valuable &mdash; an address.'</p>

  <p>"'What on earth&mdash;' began the inspector, and then he glanced at
  Lenham. 'I think you'd better sit still, Mr Lenham,' he said, quietly, 'until
  we have heard what this gentleman has to say.'</p>

  <p>"Lenham sat back in his chair with a venomous look at me. Then he laughed
  harshly.</p>

  <p>"'By all means, inspector,' he remarked. 'Only it is a little
  disconcerting to be cross-examined suddenly by a man who admits he is a
  thief.'</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact the man didn't know how much I knew &mdash; or how
  little; and between ourselves it was deuced little. But, watching him
  closely, I knew I was right, and my only hope was to bluff him into some
  admission.</p>

  <p>"'Shall we endeavour to reconstruct the events of the night when Mr Marley
  was murdered, Mr Lenardi?' I began, quietly. 'That is your name, is it not?
  &mdash; and you are a Corsican.'</p>

  <p>"'Well,' he said, 'what if I am? I had a very good reason for changing my
  name.'</p>

  <p>"'Doubtless,' I agreed. 'Let us hope your reason will prove satisfactory
  to the inspector. May I suggest, however, unless you can supply a better one,
  that your reason was to avoid the notoriety which would inevitably arise if a
  foreigner came to stay in a small village like this? And you were
  particularly anxious to avoid any possibility of Mr Marley knowing that a
  Corsican was in the neighbourhood.'</p>

  <p>"He laughed sarcastically. 'I think that I have already stated that I have
  never even seen Mr Marley,' he sneered.</p>

  <p>"'Oh!' I remarked. 'Then might I ask you, inspector, to have a look at
  this photograph? It is old and faded, but the faces are still clear.'</p>

  <p>"I handed the photograph to the inspector, and with a sudden curse the
  Corsican whipped out a knife and sprang at me. He realised even then that the
  game was up, and his one thought was to revenge himself on me. But I'd been
  expecting some such move, and I'd got a revolver handy. Incidentally,
  revolver shooting is one of the few things I can do, and I plugged him
  through the forearm before he could do any damage.</p>

  <p>"He stood there glaring at me sullenly, and then the inspector took a
  hand.</p>

  <p>"'Stand by that window, sergeant. Now, Mr whatever-your-name-is, no monkey
  tricks. Do you still deny that you knew Mr Marley?"</p>

  <p>"'I refuse to answer,' snarled the man.</p>

  <p>"'Because this photograph is of you and Marley and a woman. Taken abroad
  somewhere.'</p>

  <p>"'Naples, to be exact, inspector,' I said. 'I found it in his rooms in
  Berners Street, the address of which I got as the result of my burglary
  here."</p>

  <p>"The Corsican stood there like a beast at bay, and the inspector's face
  was stern.</p>

  <p>"'What explanation have you got to give?' he rapped out. 'Why did you lie
  in evidence?'</p>

  <p>"'I refuse to answer,' repeated the man.</p>

  <p>"'Since he is so uncommunicative,' I remarked, 'perhaps you will allow me
  to reconstruct the crime. Much of it, of necessity, is guesswork. For
  instance, Lenardi, what was your motive in murdering Mr Marley?' I rapped the
  question out at him, and though he'd have killed me willingly if he could
  have got at me he didn't deny it.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' I continued, 'it doesn't matter. Let us assume it was the girl in
  that photograph. You tracked Marley to earth here &mdash; in this village
  &mdash; that is all that concerns us. And having tracked him, you bided your
  time. Vengeance is the sweeter for delay. Each evening you walked up here,
  watching him through the window &mdash; gloating over what was to come. And
  then one night you found another man with him &mdash; Jack Fairfax &mdash;
  and they were quarrelling. At once you saw that this was your opportunity.
  However skilfully you hid your traces under ordinary circumstances, there was
  always a grave risk; but here, ready to hand, was a marvellous stroke of
  luck. Perhaps you crept nearer the window in the darkness, secure in the fact
  that the room was in a remote part of the house. You saw Jack Fairfax leave,
  blind with rage, and then, skulking out of the night, you entered the room
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>"'It's a lie!' shouted the Corsican, but his lips were white.</p>

  <p>"'And then old Marley saw you, and the rage on his face was replaced by a
  dreadful terror. He knew what you had come for. I don't think you wasted much
  time, Lenardi. You picked up the poker with a gloved hand &mdash; oh! you
  were taking no chances &mdash; and you battered his head in. And then,
  Lenardi &mdash; and then you drank a whisky-and-soda. You drank a
  whisky-and-soda, and then you decided on a very bold move: you came and
  alarmed the rest of the house. It was clever of you, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sandy-haired man smiled thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"We sprang forward together &mdash; the inspector and I; but we were too
  late. The Corsican had swallowed poison before we could stop him. He was dead
  in half a minute and he never spoke again. So I can only assume that my
  imagination was not far off the rails."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but hang it, man," said the Barrister, peevishly, "the whole thing
  was a pure fluke on your part."</p>

  <p>"I've never laid any claim to being a detective," murmured the sandy-
  haired man, mildly, rising and helping himself to some more whisky. "All that
  I said was that there are times when you can build an entire case from your
  half-brick or its equivalent. And when you find two glasses both smelling
  strongly of whisky in a room, you assume that two people have drunk whisky.
  Which was where the Corsican tripped up. You see, he distinctly swore he
  hadn't entered the room till he came in with us."</p>

  <p>The Barrister raised protesting hands to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"The man is indubitably mad," he remarked to no one in particular. "Was
  not Fairfax in the room most of the evening?"</p>

  <p>The sandy-haired man looked even more mild.</p>

  <p>"I think that perhaps I ought to have mentioned one fact sooner, but I was
  afraid it would spoil the story. The cat has an aversion to water; the fish
  have an aversion to dry land. But both these aversions pale into total
  insignificance when compared to Jack Fairfax's aversion to whisky."</p>

  <p>He gazed thoughtfully at his glass.</p>

  <p>"A strange flaw in an otherwise fine character. Thank heavens the symptom
  is not common!"</p>

  <p class="first">"Yes; she's a beautiful woman. There's no doubt about that.

  <p>"Ah! Sylvia. Of course, I remember now."</p>

  <p>He drained his glass of brandy and sat back in his chair, while his eyes
  followed one of the most beautiful women in London as she threaded her way
  through the tables towards the entrance of the restaurant. An obsequious
  headwaiter bent almost double as she passed; her exit, as usual, befitted one
  of the most bephotographed women of Society. And it was not until the doors
  had swung to behind her and her escort that the man I had been dining with
  spoke again.</p>

  <p>"I guess that little bow she gave as she passed here was yours, not mine,"
  he said, with the suspicion of a smile.</p>

  <p>"Presumably," I answered a little curtly. "Unless you happen to know her.
  I have that privilege."</p>

  <p>His smile grew a trifle more pronounced though his eyes were set and
  steady. "Know her?"</p>

  <p>He beckoned to the waiter for more brandy. "No, I can't say I know her. In
  fact, my sole claim to acquaintanceship is that I carried her for three miles
  in the dark one night, slung over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes. But I
  don't know her."</p>

  <p>"You did what?" I cried, staring at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Sounds a bit over the odds, I admit." He was carefully cutting the end
  off his cigar. "Nevertheless it stands."</p>

  <p>Now when any man states that he has carried a woman for three miles,
  whether it be in the dark or not, and has followed up such an introduction so
  indifferently that the woman fails even to recognise him afterwards, there
  would seem to be the promise of a story. But when the woman is one of the
  Lady Sylvia Claverings of this world, and the man is of the type of my dinner
  companion, the promise resolves itself into a certainty.</p>

  <p>Merton was one of those indefinable characters who defy placing. You felt
  that if you landed in Yokohama, and he was with you, you would instinctively
  rely on him for information as to the best thing to do and the best way to do
  it. There seemed to be no part of the globe, from the South Sea Islands going
  westward to Alaska, with which he was not as well acquainted as the ordinary
  man is with his native village. At the time I did not know him well. The
  dinner was only our third meeting, and during the meal we confined ourselves
  to the business which had been the original cause of our running across one
  another at all. But even in that short time I had realised that Billy Merton
  was a white man. And not only was he straight, but he was essentially a
  useful person to have at one's side in a tight corner.</p>

  <p>"Are you disposed to elaborate your somewhat amazing statement?" I asked,
  after a pause.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he hesitated, and his eyes became thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose there's any reason why I shouldn't," he answered slowly.
  "It's ancient history now &mdash; ten years or so."</p>

  <p>"That was just about the time she was married," I remarked.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "She was on her honeymoon when it happened. Well, if you want
  to hear the yarn, come round to my club."</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly," I said, beckoning for the bill. "Let's get on at once;
  I'm curious."</p>

  <p>"Do you know Africa at all?" he asked me, as we pulled our chairs up to
  the fire. We had the room almost to ourselves; a gentle snoring from the
  other fireplace betokened the only other occupant.</p>

  <p>"Egypt," I answered. "Parts of South Africa. The usual thing: nothing out
  of the ordinary."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "It was up the West Coast that it happened," he began, after
  his pipe was going to his satisfaction. "And though I've been in many
  Godforsaken spots in my life, I've never yet struck anything to compare with
  that place. Nwambi it was called &mdash; just a few shacks stretching in from
  the sea along a straggling, dusty street &mdash; one so-called shop and a
  bar. It called itself an hotel, but Lord help the person who tried to put up
  there. It was a bar pure and simple, though no one could call the liquor
  that. Lukewarm gin, some vile substitute for whisky, the usual short drinks,
  and some local poisons formed the stock; I ought to know &mdash; I was the
  bartender.</p>

  <p>"For about three miles inland there stretched a belt of stinking swamp
  &mdash; one vast malaria hotbed &mdash; and over this belt the straggling
  street meandered towards the low foothills beyond. At times it almost lost
  itself: but if you didn't give up hope, or expire from the stench, and cast
  about you'd generally find it again leading you on to where you felt you
  might get a breath of God's fresh air in the hills. As a matter of fact you
  didn't; the utmost one can say is that it wasn't quite so appalling as in the
  swamp itself. Mosquitoes! Heavens! they had to be seen to be believed. I've
  watched 'em there literally like a grey cloud."</p>

  <p>Merton smiled reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"That &mdash; and the eternal boom of the sea on the bar half a mile out,
  made up Nwambi. How any white man ever got through alive if he had to stop
  there any length of time is beyond me; to be accurate, very few did. It was a
  grave, that place, and only the down-and-outers went there. At the time I was
  one myself.</p>

  <p>"The sole reason for its existence at all was that the water alongside the
  quay was deep enough for good-sized boats to come in, and most of the native
  produce from the district inland found its way down to Nwambi for shipment.
  Once over the belt of swamp and a few miles into the hills the climate was
  much better, and half a dozen traders in a biggish way had bungalows there.
  They were dagos most of them &mdash; it wasn't a British part of the West
  Coast &mdash; and I frankly admit that my love for the dago has never been
  very great. But there was one Scotchman, McAndrew, amongst them &mdash; and
  he was the first fellow who came into the bar after I'd taken over the job.
  He was down for the night about some question of freight.</p>

  <p>"'You're new,' he remarked, leaning against the counter. 'What's happened
  to the other fellow? Is he dead?'</p>

  <p>"'Probably,' I returned. 'What do you want?'</p>

  <p>"'Gin &mdash; double tot. What's your name?'</p>

  <p>"I told him, and he pondered the matter while he finished his drink.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' he said at length, 'I warned your predecessor, and I'll warn you.
  Don't fall foul of my manager down here. Name of Mainwaring &mdash; I do
  <i>not</i> think. Don't give him advice about keeping off the drink, or he'll
  kill you. He's killing himself, but that's his business. I'm tough &mdash;
  you look tough, but he's got us beat to a frazzle. And take cover if he ever
  gets mixed up with any of the dagos &mdash; the place isn't healthy.'</p>

  <p>"It was just at that moment that the door swung open and a tall, lean
  fellow lounged in. He'd got an eyeglass screwed into one eye, and a pair of
  perfectly-fitting polo boots with some immaculate white breeches encased his
  legs. His shirt was silk, his sun-helmet spotless; in fact, he looked like
  the typical English dude of fiction.</p>

  <p>"'My manager, Mainwaring,' said McAndrew, by way of introduction.</p>

  <p>"Mainwaring stared at me for a moment or two &mdash; then he shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'You look sane; however, if you come here you can't be. Double gin
  &mdash; and one for yourself.'</p>

  <p>"He spoke with a faint, almost affected drawl, and as I poured out the
  drinks I watched him covertly. When he first came in I had thought him a
  young man; now I wasn't so sure. It was his eyes that made one wonder as to
  his age &mdash; they were so utterly tired. If he was indeed drinking himself
  to death, there were no traces of it as yet on his face, and his hand as he
  lifted his glass was perfectly steady. But those eyes of his &mdash; I can
  see them now. The cynical bitterness, the concentrated weariness of all Hell
  was in them. And it's not good for any man to look like that; certainly not a
  man of thirty-five, as I afterwards discovered his age to be."</p>

  <p>Merton paused and sipped his whisky-and-soda, while from the other side of
  the room came indications that the sleeper still slept.</p>

  <p>"I never found out what his real name was," he continued, thoughtfully.
  "Incidentally, it doesn't much matter. We knew him as Mainwaring, and the J
  which preceded it in his signature was assumed to stand for James or Jimmy.
  Anyway, he answered to it, which was the main point. As far as I know, he
  never received a letter and he never read a paper, and I guess I got to know
  him better than anyone else in that hole. Every morning, punctual to the
  second at eleven o'clock, he'd stroll into the bar and have three double
  gins. Sometimes he'd talk in his faint, rather pleasant drawl; more often
  he'd sit silently at one of the rickety tables, staring out to sea, with his
  long legs stretched out in front of him. But whichever he did &mdash;
  whatever morning it was &mdash; you could always see your face in his
  boots.</p>

  <p>"I remember once, after I'd been there about a month, I started to pull
  his leg about those boots of his.</p>

  <p>"'Take the devil of a long time cleaning them in the morning, don't you,
  Jimmy?' I said, as he lounged up to the bar for his third gin.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he answered, leaning over the counter so that his face was close
  to mine. 'Got anything further to say about my appearance?'</p>

  <p>"'Jimmy,' I replied, 'your appearance doesn't signify one continental damn
  to me. But as the only two regular British <i>habitués</i> of this
  first-class American bar, don't let's quarrel.'</p>

  <p>"He grinned &mdash; a sort of slow, lazy grin.</p>

  <p>"'Think not?' he said. 'Might amuse one. However, perhaps you're
  right.'</p>

  <p>"And so it went on &mdash; one sweltering day after another, until one
  could have gone mad with the hideous boredom of it. I used to stand behind
  the bar there sometimes and curse weakly and foolishly like a child, but I
  never heard Mainwaring do it. What happened during those steamy nights in the
  privacy of his own room, when he &mdash; like the rest of us &mdash; was
  fighting for sleep, is another matter. During the day he never varied. Cold,
  cynical, immaculate, he seemed a being apart &mdash; above our little worries
  and utterly contemptuous of them. Maybe he was right &mdash; maybe the thing
  that had downed him was too big for foolish cursing. Knowing what I do now, a
  good many things are clear which one didn't realise at the time.</p>

  <p>"Only once, I think, did I ever get in the slightest degree intimate with
  him. It was latish one evening, and the bar was empty save for us two. I'd
  been railing against the fate that had landed me penniless in such an
  accursed spot, and after a while he chipped in, in his lazy drawl: "'Would a
  thousand be any good to you?'</p>

  <p>"I looked at him speechless. 'A thousand pounds?' I stammered.</p>

  <p>"'Yes; I think I can raise that for you.' He was staring in front of him
  as he spoke. 'And yet I don't know. I've got more or less used to you and
  you'll have to stop a bit longer. Then we'll see about it.'</p>

  <p>"'But, good heavens! man,' I almost shouted, 'do you mean to say that you
  stop here when you can lay your hand on a thousand pounds?'</p>

  <p>"'It appears so, doesn't it?' He rose and stalked over to the bar. 'It
  doesn't much matter where you stop, Merton, when you can't be in the one
  place where you'd sell your hopes of Heaven to be. And it's best, perhaps, to
  choose a place where the end will come quickly.'</p>

  <p>"With that he turned on his heel, and I watched him with a sort of dazed
  amazement as he sauntered down the dusty road, white in the tropical moon,
  towards his own shack. A thousand pounds! The thought of it rang in my head
  all through the night. A thousand pounds! A fortune! And because, out in
  death-spots like that, men are apt to think strange thoughts &mdash; thoughts
  that look ugly by the light of day &mdash; I found myself wondering how long
  he could last at the rate he was going. Two &mdash; sometimes three &mdash;
  bottles of gin a day: it couldn't be long. And then &mdash; who knew? It
  would be quick, the break-up; all the quicker because there was not a trace
  of it now. And perhaps when it came he'd remember about that thousand. Or I
  could remind him."</p>

  <p>Merton laughed grimly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we're pretty average swine, even the best of us, when we're up
  against it, and I lay no claims to be a plaster saint. But Fate had decreed
  that Jimmy Mainwaring was to find the end which he craved for quicker than he
  had anticipated. Moreover &mdash; and that's what I've always been glad about
  &mdash; it had decreed that he was to find it before drink had rotted that
  iron constitution of his; while his boots still shone and his silk shirts
  remained spotless. It had decreed that he was to find it in the way of all
  others that he would have chosen, had such a wild improbability ever
  suggested itself. Which is going ahead a bit fast with the yarn &mdash; but
  no matter.</p>

  <p>"It was after I'd been there about three months that the incident happened
  which was destined to be the indirect cause of his death. I told you, didn't
  I, that there were several dago traders who lived up in the foothills, and on
  the night in question three of them had come down to Nwambi on business of
  some sort &mdash; amongst them one Pedro Salvas, who was as unpleasant a
  specimen of humanity as I have ever met. A crafty, orange-skinned brute, who
  indulged, according to common knowledge, in every known form of vice, and a
  good many unknown ones too. The three of them were sitting at a table near
  the door when Mainwaring lounged in &mdash; and McAndrew's words came back to
  me. The dagos had been drinking; Jimmy looked in his most uncompromising
  mood. He paused at the door, and stared at each of them in turn through his
  eyeglass; then he turned his back on them and came over to me.</p>

  <p>"I glanced over his shoulder at the three men, and realised there was
  trouble coming. They'd been whispering and muttering together the whole
  evening, though at the time I had paid no attention. But now Pedro Salvas,
  with an ugly flush on his ugly face, had risen and was coming towards the
  bar.</p>

  <p>"'If one so utterly unworthy as I,' he snarled, 'may venture to speak to
  the so very exclusive Englishman, I would suggest that he does not throw
  pictures of his lady-loves about the streets.'</p>

  <p>"He was holding something in his hand, and Jimmy swung round like a
  panther. His hand went to his breast pocket; then I saw what the dago was
  holding out. It was the miniature of a girl. And after that I didn't see much
  more; I didn't even have time to take cover. It seemed to me that the
  lightning movement of Jimmy's left hand as he grabbed the miniature, and the
  terrific upper-cut with his right, were simultaneous. Anyway, the next second
  he was putting the picture back in his breast pocket, and the dago, snarling
  like a mad dog, was picking himself out of a medley of broken bottles. That
  was phase one. Phase two was equally rapid, and left me blinking. There was
  the crack of a revolver, and at the same moment a knife stuck out quivering
  in the wall behind my head. Then there was a silence, and I collected my
  scattered wits.</p>

  <p>"The revolver, still smoking, was in Jimmy's hand: Salvas, his right arm
  dripping with blood, was standing by the door, while his two pals were
  crouching behind the table, looking for all the world like wild beasts
  waiting to spring.</p>

  <p>"'Next time,' said Jimmy, 'I shoot to kill.'</p>

  <p>"And he meant it. He was a bit white round the nostrils, which is a darned
  dangerous sign in a man, especially if he's got a gun and you're looking down
  the business end of it. And no one knew it better than those three dagos.
  They went on snarling, but not one of them moved an eyelid.</p>

  <p>"'Put your knives on that table, you scum,' ordered Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"The other two obeyed, and he laughed contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"'Now clear out. You pollute the air.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment or two they hesitated: then Salvas, with a prodigious
  effort, regained his self-control.</p>

  <p>"'You are brave, Señor Mainwaring, when you have a revolver and we are
  unarmed,' he said, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"In two strides Jimmy was at the table where the knives were lying. He
  picked one up, threw me his gun, and pointed to the other knife.</p>

  <p>"'I'll fight you now, Salvas,' he answered, quietly. 'Knife to knife, and
  to a finish.'</p>

  <p>"But the dago wasn't taking any, and 'pon my soul I hardly blamed him. For
  if ever a man was mad, Jimmy Mainwaring was mad that night: mad with the
  madness that knows no fear and is absolutely blind to consequences.</p>

  <p>"'I do not brawl in bars with drunken Englishmen,' remarked Salvas,
  turning on his heel.</p>

  <p>"A magnificent utterance, but ill-advised with Jimmy as he was. He gave a
  short laugh and took a running kick, and Don Pedro Salvas disappeared
  abruptly into the night. And the other two followed with celerity.</p>

  <p>"'You'll be getting into trouble, old man,' I said, as he came back to the
  bar, 'if you start that sort of game with the dagos.'</p>

  <p>"'The bigger the trouble the more I'll like it,' he answered, shortly.
  'Give me another drink. Don't you understand yet, Merton, that I'm beyond
  caring?'</p>

  <p>"And thinking it over since, I've come to the conclusion that he spoke the
  literal truth. It's a phrase often used, and very rarely meant; in his case
  it was the plain, unvarnished truth. Rightly or wrongly he had got into such
  a condition that he cared not one fig whether he lived or died; if anything
  he preferred the latter. And falling foul of the dago colony was a better way
  than most of obtaining his preference.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the episode that night had shown me one thing: it was a woman
  who was at the bottom of it all. I didn't ask any questions; he wasn't a man
  who took kindly to cross-examination. But I realised pretty forcibly that if
  the mere handling of her picture by a dago had produced such a result, the
  matter must be serious. Who she was I hadn't any idea, or what was the
  trouble between them &mdash; and, as I say, I didn't ask.</p>

  <p>"And then one day a few weeks later I got the answer to the first
  question. Someone left a month-old <i>Tatler</i> in the bar, and I was
  glancing through it when Mainwaring came in. I reached up for the gin bottle
  to give him his usual drink, and when I turned round to hand it to him he was
  staring at one of the pictures with the look of a dead man on his face. I can
  see him now with his knuckles gleaming white through the sunburn of his
  hands, and his great powerful chest showing under his shirt. He stood like
  that maybe for five minutes &mdash; motionless; then, without a word, he
  swung round and left the bar. And I picked up the paper."</p>

  <p>Merton paused and drained his glass.</p>

  <p>"Lady Sylvia's wedding?" I asked, unnecessarily, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"So the first part of the riddle was solved," he continued, quietly. "And
  when two days passed by without a sign of Mainwaring, I began to be afraid
  that he had solved his own riddle in his own way. But he hadn't; he came into
  the bar at ten o'clock at night, and leaned up against the counter in his
  usual way.</p>

  <p>"'What have you been doing with yourself?' I said, lightly.</p>

  <p>"'I've been trying to get drunk,' he answered slowly, letting one of his
  hands fall on my arm with a grip like steel. 'And, dear God! I can't.'</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound much &mdash; told like this in the smoking room of a
  London club. But though I've seen and heard many things in my life that have
  impressed me &mdash; horrible, dreadful things that I shall never forget
  &mdash; the moment of all others that is most indelibly stamped on my brain
  is that moment when, leaning across the bar, I looked into the depths of the
  soul of the man who called himself Jimmy Mainwaring &mdash; the man who could
  not get drunk."</p>

  <p>Once again he paused, and this time I did not interrupt him. He was back
  in that steaming night, with the smell of stale spirits in his nostrils and
  the sight of strange things in his eyes. And I felt that I, too, could
  visualise that tall, immaculate Englishman leaning against the counter
  &mdash; the man who was beyond caring.</p>

  <p>"But I must get on with it," continued Merton, after a while. "The club
  will be filling up soon and I've only got the finish to tell you now. And by
  one of those extraordinary coincidences which happen far more frequently in
  life than people will allow, the finish proved a worthy one.</p>

  <p>"It was about two days later. I was in the bar polishing the glasses when
  the door swung open and two men came in. They were obviously English, and
  both of them were dressed as if they were going to a garden party.</p>

  <p>"'Thank heavens! Tommy, here's a bar, at any rate,' said one of them. 'I
  say, barman, what have you got?'</p>

  <p>"Well, I had a bit of a liver, and I disliked being called barman.</p>

  <p>"'Several bottles of poison,' I answered, 'and the hell of a temper.'</p>

  <p>"The second one laughed, and after a moment or two the other joined
  in.</p>

  <p>"'I don't wonder at the latter commodity,' he said. 'This is a ghastly
  hole.'</p>

  <p>"'I wouldn't deny it,' I answered. 'What, if I may ask, has brought you
  here?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, we've had a small breakdown, and the skipper came in here to repair
  it. We've just come ashore to have a look round.'</p>

  <p>"I glanced through the window, and noticed for the first time that a steam
  yacht was lying off the shore. She was a real beauty &mdash; looked about a
  thousand tons &mdash; and I gave a sigh of envy.</p>

  <p>"'You're not in want of a barman, by any chance, are you?' I said. 'If so,
  I'll swim out and chance the sharks.'</p>

  <p>"''Fraid we've got everything in that line,' he answered. 'But select the
  least deadly of your poisons, and join us.'</p>

  <p>"And it was as I was pulling down the gin and vermouth that Jimmy
  Mainwaring came into the bar. He got about halfway across the floor, and then
  he stopped dead in his tracks. And I guess during the next two seconds you
  could have heard a pin drop.</p>

  <p>'So this is where you've hidden yourself,' said the smaller of the two men
  &mdash; the one who had done most of the talking. 'I don't think we'll
  trouble you for those drinks, barman.'</p>

  <p>"Without another word he walked out of the place &mdash; and after a
  moment or two the other man started to follow him. He hesitated as he got
  abreast of Jimmy, and then for the first time Mainwaring spoke: 'Is she
  here?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' answered the other. 'On board the yacht. There's a whole party of
  us.'</p>

  <p>"And with that he stepped into the street and joined his pal. With a
  perfectly inscrutable look on his face Jimmy watched them as they walked
  through the glaring sun and got into the small motorboat that was waiting
  alongside the quay. Then he came up to the bar.</p>

  <p>"'An artistic touch, doubtless, on the part of Fate,' he remarked,
  quietly. 'But a little unnecessary.'</p>

  <p>"And I guess I metaphorically took off my hat to him at that moment. What
  he'd done, why he was there, I neither knew nor cared; all that mattered to
  me was the way he took that last rotten twist of the surgeon's knife. Not by
  the quiver of an eyelid would you have known that anything unusual had
  happened: he drank his three double gins at exactly the same rate as every
  other morning. And then he too swung out of the bar, and went back to his
  office in McAndrew's warehouse, leaving me to lie down on my bed and sweat
  under the mosquito curtains, while I wondered at the inscrutable working out
  of things. Was it blind, the Fate that moved the pieces; or was there some
  definite pattern beyond our ken? At the moment it seemed pretty blind and
  senseless; later on &mdash; well, you'll be able to form your own
  opinion.</p>

  <p>"You know how quickly darkness falls in those latitudes. And it was just
  before sunset that I saw a boat shoot away from the side of the yacht and
  come full speed for the shore. I remember I wondered casually who was the mug
  who would leave a comfortable yacht for Nwambi, especially after the report
  of it that must have been given by our two morning visitors. And then it
  struck me that, whoever it might be, he was evidently in the deuce of a
  hurry. Almost before the boat came alongside a man sprang out and scrambled
  up the steps. Then at a rapid double he came sprinting towards me as I stood
  at the door of the bar. It was the smaller of the two men who had been ashore
  that morning, and something was evidently very much amiss.</p>

  <p>"'Where is she?' he shouted, as soon as he came within earshot. 'Where's
  my wife, you damned scoundrel?'</p>

  <p>"Seeing that he was quite beside himself with worry and alarm, I let the
  remark go by.</p>

  <p>"'Steady!' I said, as he came gasping up to me. 'I haven't got your wife;
  I haven't even seen her.'</p>

  <p>"'It's that card-sharper!' he cried. 'By God! I'll shoot him like a dog,
  if he's tried any monkey tricks!'</p>

  <p>"'Dry up, and pull yourself together,' I said angrily. 'If you're alluding
  to Jimmy Mainwaring&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"And at that moment Jimmy himself stepped out of his office and strolled
  across the road.</p>

  <p>"'You swine, you cursed card cheat &mdash; where's Sylvia?'</p>

  <p>"'What the devil are you talking about?' said Jimmy, and his voice was
  tense.</p>

  <p>"'She came ashore this afternoon, saying she would return in an hour,'
  said the other man. 'I didn't know it at the time, Mr &mdash; er &mdash;
  Mainwaring, I believe you call yourself. The boat came back for her, and she
  was not there. That was four hours ago. Where is she?'</p>

  <p>"He was covering Jimmy with his revolver as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"'Four hours ago, Clavering! Good heavens! man &mdash; put down your gun.
  This isn't a time for amateur theatricals.' He brushed past him as if he was
  non-existent and came up to me. 'Did you see Lady Clavering?'</p>

  <p>"'Not a trace,' I answered, and the same fear was in both of us.</p>

  <p>"'Did she say what she was coming on shore for?' He swung round on the
  husband.</p>

  <p>"'To have a look round,' answered Clavering, and his voice had altered. No
  longer was he the outraged husband; he was a frightened man relying
  instinctively on a bigger personality than himself.</p>

  <p>"'If she's not about here, she must have gone inland,' said Jimmy, staring
  at me. 'And it'll be dark in five minutes.'</p>

  <p>"'My God!' cried Clavering, 'what are we to do? She can't be left alone
  for the night. Lost &mdash; in this cursed country! She may have hurt herself
  &mdash; sprained her ankle.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment neither of us answered him. Even more than he did we realise
  the hideous danger of a white woman alone in the bush inland. There were
  worse dangers than snakes and wild animals to be feared. And it was as we
  were standing there staring at one another, and afraid to voice our thoughts,
  that one of McAndrew's native boys came down the street. He was running and
  out of breath; and the instant he saw Jimmy he rushed up to him and started
  gabbling in the local patois. He spoke too fast for me to follow him, and
  Clavering, of course, couldn't understand a word. But we both guessed
  instinctively what he was talking about and we both watched Jimmy's face. And
  as we watched it I heard Clavering catch his breath sharply.</p>

  <p>"At last the boy finished, and Jimmy turned and looked at me. On his face
  was a look of such cold malignant fury that the question which was trembling
  on my lips died away, and I stared at him speechlessly.</p>

  <p>"The dagos have got her,' he said, very softly. 'Don Pedro Salvas is, I
  fear, a foolish man.'</p>

  <p>"Clavering gave a sort of hoarse cry, and Jimmy's face softened.</p>

  <p>"'Poor devil,' he said. 'Your job is going to be harder than mine. Go back
  to your yacht &mdash; get all your men on shore that you can spare &mdash;
  and if I'm not back in four hours, wait for dawn and then strike inland over
  the swamp. Find Pedro Salvas' house &mdash; and hang him on the highest tree
  you can find.'</p>

  <p>"Without another word he swung on his heel and went up the street at a
  long, steady lope. Twice Clavering called after him, but he never turned his
  head or altered his stride &mdash; and then he started to follow himself. It
  was I who stopped him, and he cursed me like a child &mdash; almost
  weeping.</p>

  <p>"'Do what he told you,' I said. 'You'd never find your way; you'd be worse
  than useless. I'll go with him: you get back and bring your men ashore."</p>

  <p>"And with that I followed Jimmy. At times I could see him, a faint white
  figure in the darkness, as he dodged through that fever-laden swamp; at times
  I found myself marvelling at the condition of the man, bearing in mind his
  method of living. Steadily, tirelessly, he forged ahead, and when he came to
  the foothills I hadn't gained a yard on him.</p>

  <p>"And then I began wondering what was going to happen when he reached
  Salvas' bungalow, and by what strange mischance the girl had met the owner.
  That it was revenge I was certain; he had recognised her from the picture,
  and I remember thinking how bitter must have been his hatred of Mainwaring to
  have induced him to run such an appalling risk. For the risk was appalling,
  even in that country of strange happenings.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that Jimmy troubled his head over any such speculations. In
  his mind there was room for only one thought &mdash; an all-sufficient
  thought &mdash; to get his hands on Pedro Salvas. I don't think he even knew
  that I was behind him, until after it was over and the curtain was falling on
  the play. And then he had no time for me."</p>

  <p>Merton gave a short laugh that had in it a touch of sadness.</p>

  <p>"A good curtain it was, too," he continued, quietly. "I remember I made a
  frantic endeavour to overtake him as he raced up to the house, and then,
  because I just couldn't help myself, I stopped and watched &mdash;
  fascinated. The window of the big living room was open, and the light blazed
  out. I suppose they had never anticipated pursuit that night. Leaning up
  against the wall was the girl, with a look of frozen horror on her face,
  while seated at the table were Pedro Salvas and three of his pals. And they
  were drinking.</p>

  <p>"It all happened very quickly. For one second I saw Jimmy Mainwaring
  framed in the window &mdash; then he began shooting. I don't think I've
  mentioned that he could shoot the pip out of the ace of diamonds nine times
  out of ten at twenty yards, and his madness did not interfere with his aim.
  And that night he was stark, staring mad. I heard three shots &mdash; so
  close together that only an artist could have fired them out of the same
  revolver and taken aim; I saw the three friends of Pedro Salvas collapse
  limply in their chairs. And then there was a pause; I think Jimmy wanted to
  get at <i>him</i> with his hands.</p>

  <p>"But it was not to be. Just for a moment the owner of the bungalow had
  been so stupefied at the sudden appearance of the man he hated that he had
  simply sat still, staring; but only for a moment. The movement of his arm was
  so quick that I hardly saw it; I only noticed what seemed to be a streak of
  light which shot across the room. And then I heard Jimmy's revolver again
  &mdash; the tenth, the hundredth of a second too late. He'd drilled Pedro
  Salvas through the heart all right &mdash; I watched the swine crumple and
  fall with the snarl still on his face &mdash; but this time the knife wasn't
  sticking in the wall.</p>

  <p>"She got to him first," went on Merton, thoughtfully. "His knees were
  sagging just as I got to the window, and she was trying to hold him up in her
  arms. And then between us we laid him down, and I saw that the end was very
  near. There was nothing I could do; the knife was clean into his chest. The
  finish of the journey had come to the man who could not get drunk. And so I
  left them together, while I mounted guard by the window with a gun in each
  hand. It wasn't a house to take risks in.</p>

  <p>"He lived, I think, for five minutes, and of those five minutes I would
  rather not speak. There are things which a man may tell, and things which he
  may not. Sufficient be it to say that he may have cheated at cards or he may
  not &mdash; she loved him. If, indeed, he had committed the unforgivable sin
  amongst gentlemen all the world over, he atoned for it. And she loved him.
  Let us leave it at that.</p>

  <p>"And when it was over, and the strange, bitter spirit of the man who
  called himself Jimmy Mainwaring had gone out on the unknown road, I touched
  her on the shoulder. She rose blindly and stumbled out into the darkness at
  my side. I don't think I spoke a word to her, beyond telling her to take my
  arm. And after a while she grew heavier and heavier on it, until at last she
  slipped down &mdash; a little unconscious heap of sobbing girlhood."</p>

  <p>Merton paused and lit a cigarette with a smile.</p>

  <p>"So that is how it was ordained that I should carry the Lady Sylvia
  Clavering, slung over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes, for three miles. I
  remember staggering into the village to find myself surrounded by men from
  the yacht. I handed her over to her distracted husband, and then I rather
  think I fainted myself. I know I found myself in my own bar, with people
  pouring whisky down my throat. And after a while they cleared off, leaving
  Clavering alone with me. He began to stammer out his thanks, and I cut him
  short.</p>

  <p>"'No thanks are due to me,' I said. 'They're due to another man whom you
  called a card cheat &mdash; but who was a bigger man than either you or I are
  ever likely to be.'</p>

  <p>"'Was?' he said, staring at me.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I answered. 'He's dead.'</p>

  <p>"He stood there silently for a moment or two; then with a queer look on
  his face he took off his hat.</p>

  <p>"'You're right,' he said. 'He was a bigger man than me.' "</p>

  <p>Merton got up and pressed the bell.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen him from that day to this," he said, thoughtfully. "I
  never saw his wife again until tonight. And I've never filled in the gaps in
  the story. Moreover, I don't know that I want to."</p>

  <p>A waiter came over to his chair.</p>

  <p>"You'll join me? Two whiskies-and-sodas, please, waiter &mdash; large
  ones."</p>
