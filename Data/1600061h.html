<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>THE authors of the following pages had doubts at the
commencement of their labours of being able to lay before the
public, in the present state of the Australian Gold Colonies, a
work of such a character as would not only be useful to those who
might determine upon hazarding their fortunes in them, but at the
same time be interesting to the general reader. Though they still
entertain fears of having accomplished this object, nevertheless
they venture upon its publication; trusting that the truthfulness
and fidelity of their statements will interest all classes of
readers.</p>

<p>Nothing that is likely to mislead people should be stated by
travellers at any time; nor will we suppose that wilful
misstatements are made by contemporary authors; but at the present
time it is particularly important to be careful and accurate either
in descriptions of, or observations upon, these distant colonies,
where so many of our countrymen, and those who confidingly
accompany them, are resolved to cast their fortunes. This
consideration has had its weight with us; and if we ever thought of
indulging in flights of imagination, our inclinations have been
checked by the fear that our so doing might tend to mischief.
Consequently, the reader will find in these pages nothing more than
a simple narrative of facts observed during a journey through these
important colonies at the most interesting period of their history,
presenting an unvarnished picture of the country and its
inhabitants as they exist under the new order of things created by
the gold-discovery; while the details given of the ordinary
occupations pursued by the colonists, and our hints regarding them,
are the result of long and practical experience in the Australian
colonies in the public service, as settlers, and otherwise. And
although changes are rapidly taking place in these young
communities, yet we are confident that the traveller, with our book
in his hand, some ten or even twenty years hence, will easily
recognise the various cities, towns, districts, and estates herein
described, however greatly they may have increased in extent and
population; and we flatter ourselves that the tenour of our remarks
on the social and political condition of the people are based upon
those sound principles of human nature which will apply for all
time. So that the intending colonist, who may be guided by our
statements in his selection of a spot for his future labours, will
find that we have neither exaggerated nor misrepresented the
country or the inhabitants of any one locality.</p>

<p>With these few observations we send our volume forth to the
public; in the full confidence that, if there is any thing in it
worthy of their approbation, it will work its way.</p>

<p>London, February 1853.</p>

<p>ANY one who glances occasionally over the casualties recorded in
our shipping intelligence, must remark the very small number of
vessels lost on the outward voyage to the Australian colonies;
while scarcely a week elapses that we do not find in the registry
at Lloyds', intelligence of some ship foundering at sea, or being
swallowed up in a hurricane, during the much shorter voyages to
America and the West Indies. These facts are easily comprehended by
experienced mariners and old voyagers; but passengers who for the
first time intend hazarding a long voyage at sea imperfectly
understand them. Nevertheless such is the case, that the passage
out to Australia, occupying three or four months, and sailing over
an extent of ocean nothing short of fifteen thousand miles, is
safer than an ordinary week's voyage through the German Ocean or
any of the British Channels. In fact, the time when most danger is
to be apprehended from shipwreck or collision, is while the vessel
is threading its way through the intricacies of river and channel
navigation that lie between the ports of departure and the open
sea. When once the "good ship" is clear of the foggy coasts which
encircle the British Isles, and "Biscay's sleepless bay" is among
the latitudes behind, all is plain sailing and fine weather for the
remainder of the voyage. So free from tempest have we experienced
it, sailing from London in September, that the ship's longboat
could have accomplished it without great risk.</p>

<p>As our voyage out was what ship-masters consider an average
passage, a slight sketch of it will convey to the reader some idea
of the ordinary route pursued by a sailing vessel bound for
Australia. And as we whiled away a few minutes pleasantly each day
after eight bells pricking out our latitude and longitude on the
map obligingly furnished to us by the mate, we have inserted at the
beginning of this chapter an outline chart of the world with our
route laid down; to which we refer the reader on perusing the
following synopsis of our log. [Map at end of this ebook.]</p>

<p class="newspaper">On the fourth night from the Downs, cleared
the English Channel. The Lizard Light dipped below the horizon.
Strong breezes and squally weather. Every body, i.e. the
passengers, sick and uncomfortable. In three days more, crossed the
Bay of Biscay: ship under single-reefed topsails. A few male
passengers appearing from below in pilot-jackets; but suddenly
vanishing at the aspect of the weather. Eleventh day out, passed
the island of Madeira. Fine summer weather. All sail set. Every
body on deck. In three days more got into the north-east
trade-winds. Studding-sails set alow and aloft. Weather warm,
clear, and pleasant. Every body dressed in light clothing. N.B. The
passengers considered themselves by this time old sailors, and
wondered how people could be frightened at a sea voyage. Sixteenth
day out, entered the tropic of Cancer. Thermometer at 85° in the
shade. Two dogs attacked with hydrophobia, and both destroyed.</p>

<p>There are one or two remarkable circumstances connected with
this canine disease, which we observed on the voyage and in
Australia, worth recording, particularly as we are not aware of
their having been mentioned by previous travellers. Out of eight
dogs taken on board in England, five became rabid and were
destroyed before we reached the equator. The other three "crossed
the line" without showing any symptoms of the malady; neither did
they exhibit the smallest tendency to become rabid in passing
through the southern tropical zone, although exposed to greater
abstinence from water than those attacked while we were in the
northern tropic. The disease has not been known amongst the bands
of dogs which infest the towns in Australia, and which are all
descended from the hydrophobic curs of Britain. In fact, if we are
not in error, scarcely an authenticated case of this unaccountable
distemper has been known in the southern hemisphere. How will
physicians solve this problem? Is it an atmospheric agent which
engenders the virus? and is that agent an impurity in the air of
the northern hemisphere which does not exist in the south? A little
inquiry into this subject would no doubt elicit some valuable
medical statistics for the information of patients, and relating to
the well-known salubrity of the Australian climate.</p>

<p>To resume our log.</p>

<p class="newspaper">We were bowling through the waves of the North
Atlantic at the rate of eleven knots an hour. Sailed through the
north-east trade-winds in ten days. Got into the doldrums for a
couple of days. Calms and tropical thunder-storms. Every body
listless and lazy. Quantities of ginger-beer and soda-powders
effervesced to quench a universal thirst; but of small avail. Fresh
water at a premium. Melting moments. Every body bathing. Patent
shower-bath&mdash;a bucket and a basket. Glorious sunsets. Several
ships in company. Signal the longitude. A breeze sprung up; which
proved to be the south-east trade-wind. Spoke an Indiaman homeward
bound. Sent letters on board. "Crossed the line" on the thirtieth
day out, in longitude 20° west. Instead of the ancient ceremony of
father Neptune and his train appearing on board to demand largess
for invading his briny kingdom, our captain commemorated the
occasion by simply stretching a thread across the glass of his
telescope, which he endeavoured to persuade the ladies, when they
saw it through the instrument, was the veritable line; and with one
or two of our fair friends it went down remarkably well. Of course
we all enjoyed the joke; and no doubt all were better pleased than
if they had been subjected to the barbarous custom of being shaved
with a rusty iron hoop and drenched with water.<br>
<br>
Sailed merrily through the south-east trade-winds. Saw shoals of
flying-fish; caught a few, and found them very delicate food.
Weather warm, with occasional showers, which made the air feel
humid and every thing muggy. Every body airing their linen and
bedding; the ship looking like rag-fair. In eleven days from the
equator we crossed the tropic of Capricorn, Found the influence of
the trade-winds as high up as 25° south latitude, within two
degrees of the South American continent. The vessel sailed so
steadily that we dispensed with the battens around the cabin table.
The passengers began to feel the monotony of life on board ship:
love-making and mischief-making the order of the day, for want of
better to do.</p>

<p>Most passengers of an intellectual turn of mind, who have never
been a long voyage before, plan out all sorts of tasks to be
accomplished, and resolve to apply themselves studiously to their
books on the passage out. We have never known an instance wherein
one tenth part of such resolutions have been carried into effect.
And how is it possible in these Australian ships, where they are so
crowded? There is a continued turmoil in them from six in the
morning till ten at night, which not only disturbs all application
to studious pursuits, but prevents the enjoyment of ordinary light
reading. This, coupled with the heat during the first fifty days of
the voyage, when the thermometer ranges from 75° to 85° under the
awning, throws a lassitude over both mind and body which prostrates
the most active temperament, during which period the only
occupations practicable are those of eating, drinking, and
sleeping. Every body knows or has been told that there is no place
like shipboard to obtain an insight into your neighbour's real
character. The reason of this is, because the intellectual part of
our nature lies dormant, and we become known to each other through
our propensities, which cause us to display more broad and evident
traits of character than the purely moral or intellectual. Pent up
as we necessarily are at sea within the narrow compass of a ship's
cabin, and with scarcely any outward incidents to counteract the
selfishness of our nature, it is not to be wondered at that the
individual character will appear in a different phase from what it
assumes on shore. Hence the main-spring of the animal functions,
eating, becomes the ruling passion; and man's belly for the time
being is his god. Herein lies the cause of nineteen out of the
twenty quarrels which notoriously occur on board ship. From stem to
stern the quality and quantity of food has always been a matter of
contention between the dispensers and the receivers. We have seen
Jack raise the growl of mutiny because his junk was bad; we have
seen steerage passengers pitch the casks of maggoty biscuit
overboard, and demand fresh bread from the captain in language not
to be trifled with; and we have seen poor deluded intermediates
call the captain to account at the end of the voyage for the musty
provisions doled out to them; ay, and even the most amiable
disposition in the cabin is not proof against the dire effects of
an unsatisfied appetite. When under its influence, bright eyes and
fond lips are then more prone to look with devotion upon the wing
of a fowl than the face of a lover; and jealousy will often send a
pang through the stomach&mdash;we had almost said the
heart&mdash;when the captain sends a favourite tit-bit of turkey to
some one on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>To resume our log.</p>

<p class="newspaper">We had sailed out of the S.E. trades and got
into variable winds; the weather became unsteady, and we made a
zig-zag course for a few days. The intermediate passengers grumbled
at their rations becoming of inferior quality; and there were
symptoms of the water getting scarce; the captain pacified them by
stating that he would put in at the Cape to refresh the ship's
stores. As the details of our log are here given with a view to
initiate all classes of passengers into the mysteries of a long
voyage, we shall be excused by adverting in this place to the
condition of these intermediate passengers for the benefit of
future emigrants; particularly as so many vessels now sail from
English ports for these colonies fitted up to carry one class of
passengers only, whose dietary scale and accommodation are similar
to what was provided on board our ship for the intermediate
passengers.</p>

<p>Those who have made a long voyage at sea are well aware that
attendance and a proper regulation of the meals on board constitute
the first desideratum towards the comfort of the passengers. Hence
a cabin-passage is always high, in consequence of table-furnishing
expenses, stewards' wages, &amp;c., besides wine, spirits, and
beer. But amongst the class of passengers referred to, from the
small amount of passage-money paid, no stewards can be provided to
attend the table, to draw the water issued daily, or the provisions
weekly, or to take them to the galley to be cooked; consequently,
every passenger, male and female, must attend to these necessary
duties, besides carrying down the food when cooked to the long deal
table, and then either eating alone or in messes of six or eight,
each one washing the dishes in turn after meals. Such duties become
rather disagreeable to ladies and gentlemen who have taken cheap
passages on board uniform-rate ships, or as intermediate
passengers, with the supposition that all the difference between
their accommodation and that of the cabin-passengers consists only
in the quality of food and cabin furniture. We are confident,
however, that a medium arrangement could be adopted, satisfactory
to the passengers and profitable to the owners. The latter could
provide vessels at rather higher rates, in which the requisite
attendance might be supplied. Suppose the 'tween decks to be
partitioned off into three or four separate compartments, with
companion-ladders at the fore, main, and after hatchways; thus
dividing the long workhouse-looking table which at present reaches
clear fore and aft the whole length of the ship. That each
compartment with its thirty or forty passengers should be attended
to by a man and a boy, whose services could be easily obtained
gratuitously for their free passage out. Add to this a more liberal
scale of fresh provisions; fewer berths in each cabin, with more
conveniences, and better ventilation; and we are sure that the
majority of intending emigrants of this class would freely give
half as much more passage-money if they knew all the disagreeables
attendant upon the present unsatisfactory arrangements.</p>

<p>Is there no inventive talent amongst our ship-builders to
suggest some improvement upon the interior construction of a ship?
Are there no better plans for the accommodation of passengers, and
stowing cargo, than the old stereotyped model of a hold 'tween
decks, cabin, and steerage? It is a disgrace to this great maritime
nation to suffer the departure of some of those floating
pesthouses, which are constantly leaving the docks of London and
Liverpool for our colonies, with less attention to their sanitary
arrangements than will be found in the lanes of St. Giles's!
Particularly those bound for the colonies under consideration,
where needy ship-owners and unprincipled shipping-agents send their
vessels to sea, each with its human freight of some two or three
hundred souls stowed away in bunks and cabins like pigs in an Irish
drogher, there to be stewed up for a couple of months in the
stifling atmosphere created by this overcrowding, beneath the
blazing sun of the torrid zones from Cancer to Capricorn.</p>

<p>This digression has lengthened our log; but if we can by such
remarks be instrumental in improving the accommodation on board
ship for future passengers, we shall consider that we have done our
duty.</p>

<p class="newspaper">Our course now lay across the South Atlantic
towards the Cape of Good Hope. Fortunately, after the two days'
tossing amongst the "variables," we met with a fine generous
westerly breeze, which carried us all the way. The weather not much
cooler than within the tropics, in consequence of the sun nearing
his summer solstice in the southern hemisphere. Observed also that
he rose upon our right, and set upon our left, attaining his
noon-day altitude in the northern heavens. Anchored in Table Bay on
the fifty-seventh day from London, which may be considered a good
"run" for a sailing-vessel. The same distance is easily
accomplished now by ocean steamers in twenty days less. Remained
three days in harbour. A break in the passage, by calling at this
"half-way house" of all nations, is an agreeable change to the
monotonous life on board ship. In two days more we sailed over the
Agullus bank with a strong westerly breeze. The wind was now right
astern, which caused our barque to toss about on the mountain waves
of these soundings, rolling about from port to starboard like an
old tub; which made it the most uncomfortable description of
sailing we had yet experienced. This is contrary to a landsman's
notions of sailing with a fair wind. Nevertheless, we did not
quarrel with the breeze, as it carried us gallantly on our course
at the rate of two hundred miles per day; so that in five days we
had sailed a thousand miles into the Indian Ocean, which bounds
Australia on the west coast. Most vessels, in order to take
advantage of these westerly winds, which prevail in the higher
latitudes of this ocean, run down their longitude in about 40°
south. Our captain followed the usual practice of ship-masters, and
steered east by south until we attained that latitude. The effect
of this proceeding upon the domestic arrangements of our company
was an entire change of clothing; everybody appeared op deck with
their winter garments on, which at once reminded us of the aspect
of the ship and the occupants when we started from England. In the
sharp bracing air which brushed our faces, we could almost fancy
that we were nearing the old country instead of its antipodes; as
one of our fellow-passengers remarked, there was a "scent of home
about it."<br>
<br>
We were not destined to carry this favourable wind all the way
across with us, for it suddenly chopped round to south-east when we
were about midway; and blew a gale of wind which caused us to
lie-to for nearly three days. This is the most unpleasant condition
for passengers to be in at sea, as there are few who can hold up
their heads while the ship is pitching and labouring; and the worst
of it is that she is going astern all the time. It is at such times
also that the want of order and regularity amongst a large body of
passengers, such as our intermediates were, shows itself more
plainly. The utter helplessness of some, and the lazy and dirty
habits of others, mingling higgledy-piggledy with the tidy neatness
of their more orderly cabin-mates, present a scene that would be
ludicrous, were it not for the sufferings of the latter. Many were
the complaints brought before the captain by ladies who occupied
cabins in this portion of our ship against the filthy habits and
language of those whom circumstances had thrown them amongst. But
what could he do to amend matters? he could only appeal to their
feelings of shame, which, in most instances, were entirely blunted.
Here his authority ended. He could not enter the cabin of the
filthy indolent passenger, whose bedding had not been aired during
the voyage, and oblige him to get up. Neither could he compel him
to wash his greasy plates and dishes, which were stinking under the
nostrils of his cabin-mates. In this respect, government emigrant
ships have the advantage; for in them cleanliness and order are
enforced by officers appointed for the purpose; whereas in the
others no discipline can be maintained, simply because the
passenger who pays his way considers his cabin as his castle, and
will do as he likes in spite of every body, within the bounds of
mutiny. The captain and his subordinate officers have the ship's
duties to attend to; and they generally consider that the comforts
of such passengers do not come within the sphere of that duty.<br>
<br>
A top-gallant breeze just abaft the beam soon carried our good ship
on her course again; and on the thirtieth day from Cape Agullus we
were in the longitude of Cape Leeuwin, the south-western angle of
the great island-continent of Australia, as some geographers term
it. Here, in latitude 39° south, we got into foggy weather and
baffling winds, having all the indications of our proximity to
land; the thermometer rising to 70°. At last we had reached the
latitudes of this far-off land, a circumstance which at once
engrossed the attention of every one on board from the cabin-boy to
the captain; and of course many were the disquisitions upon its
geographical position and relative distance from the
mother-country; the sum of which, although generally known, will be
none the worse for being inserted here, merely to refresh the
memory of the reader, whom we request to glance cursorily at its
position on the chart of the world, already referred to during our
voyage; and as we found it advantageous afterwards to re-read,
carefully about this distance from the port of our destination all
the available books to be had in the ship upon the subject, we
advise all intending colonists to make a note of this in their
journals. The same desire to turn all attention towards the goal of
our enterprise seemed universal throughout the ship. In fact, it
was only now, on reaching the latitude and longitude of the
Australian shores, that our motley assemblage of passengers began
calmly and seriously to think and speak of the prudence of the step
they had undertaken; for the hard rubs encountered in elbowing the
crowd of people whom they could not avoid on the passage out seemed
to give them a foretaste of what they should meet with in the land
of their adoption. The excitement and, in many instances, the
romance which had prompted numbers of our fellow-passengers to
emigrate, had long since passed away, and the reality of their
position for the first time presented itself, when they were just
upon the eve of landing on the shores of the promised land; and if
the secret feelings could have been recorded of many on board, no
doubt they would gladly have returned to the certain comforts they
had left for the uncertain visions of wealth they imagined in the
land before them. A seriousness, nay even a gloom, pervaded the
conversation on board, as our fellow-passengers spoke of their
future proceedings. To all such who may have similar fears of what
is in store for them, we say. Be of good cheer, the land you are
proceeding to is not a <i>foreign</i> land; the same sympathies
which followed you from the homes you have left will greet you when
once you mingle in the domestic circles of the people of
Australia.</p>

<p>To return to our lesson in geography. We take it for granted
that the reader is acquainted with the geographical position of
Australia on the globe, viz. that it is situated in the southern
hemisphere, and that it is the largest island in the world; the
details of which are, that its greatest breadth from east to west
is about 2700 miles, and at its widest part, from north to south,
about 2000 miles; its general superficies being nearly three
million square miles, or two thousand millions of square acres of
land, a superficies not far short of the extent of Europe. At the
same time it must not be supposed that the entire area of this
immense island is equally fertile with the European continent, or
capable of supporting as dense a population. As a tract of country,
it is more allied, in its geographical features, to the African
than the European continent, where the amount of available land for
the support of man is limited to a tithe of its actual extent. From
the data of travellers and explorers such as Sturt, Leichhardt,
Strzelecki, and Mitchell, we are justified in concluding that the
interior of Australia is a desert, a second Sahara; by geologists
considered the recently upheaved bed of a portion of the Indian
Archipelago, with scarcely an oasis upon it to famish nourishment
for the subsistence of its aboriginal inhabitants. Upon its borders
are found salsolaceous plants; but on its desert plains vegetation
ceases; and the western rivers, which rise in its golden
cordillera, vanish occasionally in its sandy bosom. Within that
portion which is the more immediate object of our notice, known as
south-eastern Australia, we may reasonably conclude is limited the
extent of territory, for many years to come, for successful
colonisation by the Anglo-Saxon race; for all attempts to establish
settlements of a like nature on the western, northern, and
north-eastern coasts have hitherto failed, as at Port Essington and
Port Curtis; or but slightly succeeded, as at Swan River and King
George's Sound. The existence of this desert was problematical,
until the father of Australian explorers, Captain Sturt, penetrated
into its arid plains in 1845, while commanding an expedition formed
by the South Australian government, to cross the island from north
to south. After suffering great privations from thirst and hunger,
under a heat which raised the thermometer to 137° in the shade,
Captain Sturt and his gallant band were forced to return from this
inhospitable region before they had reached half way across. Other
exploring parties had previously been repulsed in their attempts to
penetrate this <i>terra incognita</i> from the east coast on
account of its barrenness. At the same time they all concurred in
the opinion that it was a desert; most probably depressed below the
level of the sea, where fresh water and vegetation was not to be
found. Of all the indefatigable explorers, however, who have
enlarged our knowledge of Australian geography, Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt has been the most zealous to clear up this questionable
point; and we have every reason to believe that he has sacrificed
his life in the attempt. During his successful overland expedition
from Sydney to Port Essington he did much towards defining the
extent of this region to the north-east. But still his explorations
were confined to that territory, and its shed of waters, between
this desert and the sea-coast. On his return he was impressed with
the idea that this great object of Australian discovery was to be
accomplished by proceeding from the high table-land situated about
two degrees inland from the east coast, in 26° south latitude, and
directing his course towards Western Australia, a distance little
short of 3000 miles in a direct line; and hoping to find in the
desert region between, a succession of oases, like those in the
Arabian and African deserts, which would enable him to recruit his
party on the journey. He was likewise confirmed in the supposition
that such oases existed in the interior from some remarkable
circumstances related upon this head by the settlers, on undoubted
testimony, which were to this effect, that some cattle which had
been taken by sea from New South Wales to Swan River settlement in
Western Australia, were known to have <i>returned overland</i> to
the station where they had been bred. An amount of instinct
perfectly astounding, and which is borne out by facts of a lesser
degree, that have occurred amongst the horses and cattle in the
pastoral districts of Australia, and equally surprising. Leichhardt
concluding from this, that if there were provender and water for
cattle on the way, the accomplishment of an overland route from
Eastern to Western Australia was as likely to be done as his
journey to Port Essington, even although he should not cross the
desert; with those sanguine expectations, backed by his hard-earned
experience, he formed a party of ten, with the same slender
equipment which satisfied all purposes in his previous route, and
started from the Moreton Bay district on the east coast for the far
west in the spring of 1847. Since then no tidings have been heard
of either himself or his companions. And the probability is, that
if they have not been massacred by hostile aborigines, their
starved bodies are buried under the sands of the great desert.</p>

<p>From this general view of the entire island, let us now glance
at the geographical features of the two provinces through which our
narrative will soon lead us; what we may now term the Gold
Provinces of the British Empire. On reference to the subjoined map*
of this valuable section of Australia, it will be seen that it
forms the south-east angle of the island, and is comprised within
the original boundary of the well-known colony of New South Wales,
the oldest of the British dependencies in the southern hemisphere,
around which we may safely affirm all our other plantations in
Australasia have gathered and obtained nourishment. And had it not
been for the energy and perseverance displayed by the local
government in the early establishment of this colony, it is more
than probable that this great south land would still have been a
<i>terra incognita</i> on the map of the world; and the glorious
future, opening up to the energies of our fellow-subjects in that
Anglo-Australian empire, would have been still hidden in the womb
of time.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Map reproduced at the end of this ebook]</p>

<p>The province of Victoria, better known as Port Phillip, forms
the southern portion of this section, being divided from the parent
colony by the Murray river; and from its neighbour, South
Australia, by an artificial boundary in longitude 141° east, with
its sea-coast facing the south, including in its extent the
northern shore of Bass's Strait. On comparing the extent of this
province on the map with one of England on the same scale, we
perceive a similarity of size and form, Victoria being nearly
one-fifth larger; and yet it is only about one-thirtieth part of
the entire superficies of Australia. Notwithstanding this large
slice off the mother colony, New South Wales still possesses an
extent of territory three times that of Victoria, with a seaboard
on the South Pacific, from Cape Howe to 26° south latitude, being a
distance of 750 miles.</p>

<p>In addition to this geographical information, it will not be out
of place to bear in mind that the alternations of day and night are
nearly opposite in the meridians of Australia, and the succession
of the seasons entirely the reverse of Great Britain. December, the
month of frost and snow in this dreary climate, is the warmest
month in the year in Australia; and while John Bull is just sitting
down to a nine-o'clock supper, the colonist is preparing for
breakfast.</p>

<p>To return to our journal.</p>

<p class="newspaper">We left off at the hundredth day from the
Downs, during which period we had sailed by computation, in round
numbers, 15,000 miles; thus averaging 150 miles per day, which is
pretty near the rate of sailing of ordinary ships. The same
distance has been accomplished by clipper barques in eighty days;
and now that a steam-packet service has been regularly established,
the voyage out may be done in sixty days. To those who are
restricted to time this mode of conveyance will no doubt be the
most preferable; but for comfort during such a long voyage, give us
a good roomy cabin in a first-class sailing vessel. In this respect
old voyagers like ourselves look upon a ship just as an old
traveller on shore estimates an inn,&mdash;not for its
architectural beauty outside, but its convenient arrangements and
table comforts within; we prefer the snug cabin, good table, and
civil captain, with ordinary speed, to the swiftest clippers and
steamers in the trade, if they are wanting in these requisites. At
the same time we should not take a passage in any old "tub" because
it was cheap; for there we should be doubtful of the particulars
set forth in the bill of fare being carried out liberally. The ship
to be preferred is where the owners have the means to send her to
sea well stored, and a gentleman to command her. It is reasonable
to suppose that the best ship is the cheapest in the end for all
classes of passengers, and most profitable to the ship-owner; for
in a long voyage like that to Australia, speed and full
provisioning are matters of the first importance, where a
deficiency in the latter frequently prolongs the voyage by stopping
on the way for supplies. During this period seamen's wages and the
consumption of food increase the ship's disbursements, without
yielding any equivalent. In order, therefore, to lessen expenses as
much as possible, the owner of a slow-sailing vessel buys
provisions of an inferior quality, which he puts on the table after
the third or fourth week at sea, and continues to serve them out
until within a few weeks of the termination of the voyage. In a few
instances the captains of such vessels have been prosecuted in the
colonies for non-fulfilment of agreement, and have been justly
fined. But we are certain that the majority of such cases of
imposition have not been exposed; not merely from the inexperience
of emigrants in such matters, but from the desire that all men feel
to hush up grievances on the passage as soon as they reach the port
of their destination.</p>

<p>By this time our voyage was fast drawing to a close; a brisk
westerly breeze sprang up, with fair weather, which the captain
told us was indicative of our proximity to Bass's Strait, which we
should enter on the morrow, our 104th day from England, when he
hoped another day would bring us inside the harbour of Port
Phillip, our destination being the far-famed gold colony of
Victoria.</p>

<p>The intelligent reader will perceive, on taking a cursory glance
at the ship's track marked out on the small map of the world, the
reason we stated at the commencement of this chapter why the voyage
from England to Australia is the safest, considering the distance,
which can be made on the globe. Immediately the vessel clears the
chops of the Channel and sails into <i>blue water</i>, she has the
whole width of the North and South Atlantic Oceans before her
"where to choose;" in nautical language, she has abundance of "sea
room," consequently she avoids the hot blasts from the African
shores, and likewise keeps far aloof from the hurricane latitudes
of the West India Islands, crossing the equator mid-way between the
two continents, where the deadly influence of the land under the
torrid zone is powerless; running down her latitude in the South
Atlantic, she skirts the straight lands of the Brazil coast, where
there is no dangerous lee shore, with the steady south-east
trade-wind to carry her along; then, immediately that she reaches
the temperate regions in the southern hemisphere, she can steer for
a latitude amongst the forties, and if a well-appointed ship, not
requiring to put in at the Cape, she has a fair wind all the way to
Australia, across both the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. To
shorten the voyage out, some spirited mariners, taking advantage of
the latest discoveries in their profession, have adopted the
practice of great circle sailing. This system is simply illustrated
by a ship running down her longitude from the South Atlantic ocean
to the Australian coast upon the arc of a circle, which describes
the rotundity of the earth, instead of plane sailing, according to
Mercator's projection, which supposes the globe to be flattened
out, as shown in the accompanying chart. By this method of sailing
no less than a thousand miles will be saved in the length of the
voyage. In the foregoing log, having sailed from England after
summer in the northern hemisphere, we were in time to meet the
summer in the southern hemisphere, thus experiencing two midsummer
days in one year&mdash;21st June and December.</p>

<p>Pacing the deck during the middle-watch that night with our
anxious captain, we heard the look-out in the forecastle reports a
light on our lee-bow. This was soon determined, on reference to the
chart, to be the light-house on Cape Otway. As we were running
free, ten knots through the water, our skipper gave orders to
shorten sail, as he was not anxious to make too close upon the land
until daylight; so we turned into our berth and slept soundly till
morning.</p>

<p>It was a bright sunny morning in the middle of December when our
good ship safely made the Australian coast. As we sprang upon deck
with alacrity the instant we awoke, to have a first glimpse of the
land, we found the ship, with her full spread of canvass out,
sailing cheerily along before a fair west wind within a few miles
of the shore, which, as our skilful captain had calculated the
previous night, proved to be the bold land of Cape Otway. To us,
who ad been wearied gazing upon the monotony of sea and sky for so
many long weeks, the sight was refreshing and intensely
picturesque; a thrill of pleasure brightened up the countenances of
each succeeding passenger as they made their appearance on deck,
and all turned with looks of curiosity and interest to view this
portion of their adopted land which had first presented itself.
Such feelings with the mere traveller or tourist are evanescent,
for he has a home to return to, and he expects to smile over the
mishaps of his journey when he reaches his own fireside. Very
different are the impressions on the anxious heart of the emigrant
when he first obtains a glimpse of his adopted country; he comes
not here to pay a flying visit, to gaze at the sights and "lions"
of the country, and then take his departure. Over many thousand
miles of the trackless deep he has wandered from the land of his
forefathers to make himself a new home; like a bride, he leaves his
kindred and his parents' roof to wed the fortunes of a strange
country; to find a resting-place for life, and lay his bones in a
foreign land. As the port of their destination heaves in sight, the
anxious band of pilgrims notice with eager eyes the aspect of the
shore; the most trifling objects are looked upon with intense
interest; unanimity of feeling pervades every breast; all petty
quarrels are forgotten in the general excitement, and every tongue
becomes loquacious in commenting upon the varied features of the
country opened up by the moving ship.</p>

<p>The land we had thus made will be seen, on referring to the map,
to form the southern portion of the Geelong country, of which Cape
Otway is the extreme point, and guards the entrance to Bass's
Strait as well as Port Philip, Upon this conspicuous headland there
is a lighthouse erected, in every way creditable to the colony, and
forming one of three lighthouses maintained in Bass's Strait at the
joint expense of the whole group of colonies, for the benefit of
all vessels, thereby rendering the navigation of this strait in the
night-time as safe as any of the European channels. There appeared
nothing inviting about the aspect of the country at this locality
as we saw it from the ship. It seems one interminable forest over
hill and dale; the hills rising above one another in a succession
of "tiers," as they are locally termed, until they attain an
altitude of about a thousand feet, forming Mount St. George, which
we saw before us towering majestically above its neighbours, and
densely timbered to its summit; the foliage of the trees presenting
that dark sombre green which so peculiarly distinguishes the forest
scenery of Australia from that of Europe.</p>

<p>It was amongst those gloomy-looking "tiers" that two
enterprising colonists from Van Diemen's Land, Messrs. Gellibrand
and Hesse, met an untimely fate. These gentlemen were among the
first who landed on the shores of Port Philip, with their sheep and
cattle, in 1836; and it is but just that we should pay a passing
tribute to their memory, in the midst of the unparalleled
prosperity which now reigns over that land which they assisted in
reclaiming from the savage not more than sixteen years back. Their
fate was not uncommon amongst the early wanderers through the
Australian wilderness. In the enthusiasm which blinds all explorers
to the dangers which may beset their path, they started on a tour
of discovery through these forests ill prepared for the journey,
from which it is supposed that they died victims to hunger and
fatigue rather than from any hostile attack of the aborigines.
Although such fatal occurrences seldom happen in Australia now,
still there are a sufficient number of instances known of people
being lost in the bush&mdash;particularly in these gold
"prospecting" times&mdash;that new-comers should be careful how
they wander away from roads and settled districts.</p>

<p>By noon we had approached within twenty miles of Port Philip
heads, and still no opening was discernible into its spacious
harbour. That we were steering for the right point was evident from
the number of vessels of all sizes coming from the east and from
the south steering in the same direction. Upon sweeping the coast
with the telescope, however, the break soon became apparent;
likewise the lesser headlands of the Barwon river, which finds an
outlet here into the straits about twelve miles to the westward of
Port Philip entrance. This stream flows through the town of
Geelong, with sufficient depth of water for ships of a thousand
tons. Unfortunately, like many of the Australian rivers, it
possesses no navigable entrance from the sea, otherwise it would
soon raise the port of Geelong far above that of Melbourne.</p>

<p>Point Lonsdale, which forms the western, and Point Nepean, which
forms the eastern headland at the entrance to Port Philip, both
terminate in abrupt crags which are not more than two miles apart.
There is nothing very remarkable about them, excepting the
appearance they present, as if they had been rent asunder by some
violent concussion of the earth, which allowed the waters of the
strait to rush in. On reaching the entrance, our ship had to stem
the ebb-tide, which forced its way out in an impetuous current. It
was as much as she could do to keep moving ahead while sailing
through the strength of it, although she was impelled by a good
eight-knot breeze. While in mid-channel we were surprised to see a
belt of sea-weed growing across the entrance, which to us suggested
the presence of shallow water; we were astonished, therefore, when
the leadsman in the chains sounded a depth of seven fathoms. The
tide slackened as we overcame the influence of the confined stream;
and, rounding Point Nepean safely, we sailed into the smooth water
of this broad estuary, which presented to our delighted eyes all
the picturesque features of an extensive lake, surrounded by
undulating prairie-lands, and covered with a rich grassy turf to
the water's edge. Here and there the scene was relieved by hills.
On the eastern shore, Arthur's Seat and Mounts Eliza and Martha
gave variety to the landscape; and within a few miles of us on the
western shore, the lighthouse upon Shortland Bluff presented a
pleasing object to our longing eyes.</p>

<p>From this spot we saw a boat push off, which the captain
informed us was the pilot-boat. As it neared the ship all eyes were
bent upon its occupants, each one speculating upon the news which
would first greet us in this far-off land. Whatever those
ruminations might have been amongst the motley groups of passengers
assembled on the deck of our ship, certainly none of them were
prepared to hear the astounding intelligence communicated to us
upon this occasion; for we had sailed from England shortly before a
knowledge of the gold discoveries in Australia had reached there,
and we arrived in the colonies when the "great fact" was seven
months old; during which period, as all the world knows, the
unparalleled extent and richness of these gold regions had fully
developed themselves.</p>

<p>The pilot was accompanied by three gentlemen, settlers in the
vicinity of the pilot-station, who had come on board to see if they
could engage servants. These gentlemen, you may suppose, were
eagerly listened to by us all for a relation of the astounding
facts. They stated that in the midst of their pasture-lands they
had discovered incalculable treasure. That gold, the reputed source
of all evil, the universally-coveted metal, was strewed in
abundance around them. They had only to dig, and wash, and blow
away the <i>débris</i> of the mountains, and the glittering
spangles appeared before them. In the rocky clefts shepherds had
found masses of even a hundred pounds weight; and granules had been
picked up in the streets of Melbourne by children. Their flocks and
herds had been cropping the very grass which grew upon the "gold
fields;" and they knew it not until now. They had been ploughing
and harrowing the auriferous soil, sowing grain upon it, and
reaping the <i>golden</i> harvest above, without perceiving the
<i>gold</i> soil below. Nay, they had even been building
dwelling-houses and bridges upon its rocky matrix without finding
it. So easily and plentifully did it come to the hand of the
digger, that it bore the aspect of having only then sprung into
existence from the land; or that it had been scattered there within
the last few years through some mysterious agency, instead of
carrying along with it the geological fact that its veins are
coeval with the primary rocks.</p>

<p>Happy for them that it has been so! The fickle goddess Fortune
has, in this instance, borrowed the shield of Minerva, in order to
screen the tempting ore from the greedy eyes of man, until he was
prepared to work it peaceably and wisely. At first she hid it from
the felon-labourers, who were employed constructing the very road
to her golden dwelling; whilst the simple aborigines were either
ignorant of its existence, or found no utility in its properties.
Next, she covered it from the sight of the free emigrants until
they had grown sufficient food upon the land, where, in a state of
nature, there was so little for the support of civilised man; and
until they had established laws, and were ruled by an efficient
government, to prevent the crime and anarchy which have invariably
accompanied the gold-seekers in other lands. The few brief chapters
which compose the history of these colonies thus inform us how the
shackled felon has become the instrument of human progress, in
clearing the way for the corn-grower and sheep-feeder; how, in
their turn, they have furnished food for the gold-digger, who now
travels comfortably along the convict-made roads in New South
Wales, and partakes of the lavish abundance provided by the free
settler, even amongst the mountains and valleys which yield the
spontaneous treasure. These providential circumstances, and this
succession of events, had shed their benign influence over the
doings, of the gold-seekers. Well fed and well clad, with the gold
easily attainable, they had nothing to grumble at; for the greater
part of them were men who respected a constitutional government
with a potent executive. And although the arm of the latter was
weak, yet it was sufficient to preserve order amongst them, in a
community whose moral strength was its greatest protection. Hence,
instead of bloodshed and anarchy disturbing the labours of these
gold-diggers, a spirit of unanimity and confidence reigned amongst
them. Instead of robbery and murder being frequent, as in
California, their persons and property at the mines were as safe as
in the well-disciplined towns.</p>

<p>At the same time, this plethora of riches threatened the
destruction of the former staple products of the colony, wool and
tallow. Like some concealed stream of lava bursting from its
volcanic caverns through the mountain-crater, and devastating the
plains below, this production of the sterile crags was consuming
the labour which had been employed in working out the pastoral
wealth of the colony, and would seriously check the sources of two
valuable exports. The flocks and herds which had hitherto furnished
the colonists with abundance of food and clothing, and whose
surplus yield of wool and tallow had paid for their foreign
luxuries and necessaries, were upon the eve of being deserted for
this new source of gain. The fleece, which materially assisted
every man, woman, and child in the colony to purchase annually from
seven to eight pounds' value of British manufactures, was growing
to waste for want of hands to clip it from the sheep's back. The
shearing-sheds were threatened with desertion, and the boiling-pots
were standing empty and fireless; whilst the crops of grain were
reaped at the enormous sacrifice of one acre being given for
securing another. The consequence of this unexpected revolution in
the labour-market of the colony was a rise in the wages of every
description of servant and workman, which threatened to ruin the
employers, especially the wool-growers and graziers, who were
offering fifty and sixty pounds a-year to their shepherds and
stockmen, if they would remain with them. Mechanics and
day-labourers were not to be had in the towns to proceed with
building, and like operations. In many instances, where the
master's "occupation was gone," where his workmen took their
departure for the gold-fields, he was obliged to follow himself.
Men from all classes of the community had been smitten with the
fever; doctors, lawyers, and even clergymen, were among the throng
who had gone off to the diggings; so that the towns were almost
deserted by their male adult population.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey an adequate idea of the impressions
this astounding intelligence had upon our ship's company, crew and
passengers. A kind of hysterical affection seized every man and
woman on board. Some almost cried with delight; and every one gave
way to the most unbounded enthusiasm at their good luck upon
arriving in the colony at such an opportune period for the
advancement of their fortunes. The only serious man amongst us was
the captain, who had been informed by the pilot that the sailors
were running away from the ships in harbour, so that one-half of
them had been deserted by their crews; and those ships that could
manage to proceed to sea sailed without their full complement of
men; while the sailors were refusing twenty pounds a-month for the
run to England in the wool-ships, which now left the harbour with
freights of gold equal in value to their usual cargoes of tallow
and wool.</p>

<p>With buoyant hopes within us, a good ship beneath our feet, and
a fine breeze swelling the sails aloft, we bounded more cheerily
than ever across the gently-rippled waters of that spacious
estuary. The sun was declining as we passed Indented Head, and
opened up the beauties of Geelong harbour. The volcanic-looking
cone of Station Peak, and the ranges of hills far away to the
westward, with the glorious sheet of water extending for twenty
miles in that direction, were lit up by the glories of an
Australian setting sun, gilding the varieties of hill and dale and
water with a richness of tint, which all the yellow ore in the
earth below could not equal. These scenes and associations
involuntarily made us exclaim: "What a hopeful country this
Australia is for the poor and needy we have left behind in our
fatherland! It is more than a 'land of promise,' it is a land of
fulfilment. The dreams and speculations of youth, in the enjoyment
of riches and plenty, are here realised beyond the brightest hopes.
The visionary treasure-seeker in the gloomy regions of the north
can here grasp the substance, and enjoy the bounties it will bring
to his utmost desires, beneath the loveliest climate that is warmed
by God's glorious sun."</p>

<p>Night had set in before we could discern the shipping in Hobson
Bay distinctly; for in this land, as Coleridge hath it, "at one
stride comes the dark." Still the interest was undiminished as we
neared the lighthouse on Point Drake, which now shone a Triton
amongst the minnows, as the flickering lights from the many vessels
lying at anchor starred the horizon with their tiny lamps. The
breeze by this time had begun to die away, so we made but little
progress through the water. And as if by one consent, the
passengers prepared to retire early for the night. The varied
sights which had appeared before us during this our last day of the
voyage, and the exciting news which had been communicated to us on
this our first day of arrival, seemed to have strained the eyes and
ears of us all to their utmost tension; and we "turned in" for the
last time into our narrow berths with sleepy eyes, hopeful of the
morrow.</p>

<p>We slept so soundly that the dropping of the anchor about
midnight, as the ship was "brought up" in Hobson Bay, did not
awaken us. In the morning therefore, when we got on deck, we
enjoyed more satisfactorily, because it was fresh to the eye, the
pleasing view of the surrounding country, and the throng of vessels
lying at anchor in the bay. Although the former presents a
gratifying prospect to the gaze of the stranger, after three or
four months monotonous study of sea and sky, still there is not
much for the artist to sketch in the low sand-flats, thinly covered
with stunted trees, in the immediate vicinity of the bay. On the
eastern shore, a clearing upon some rising ground with a cottage or
two visible through the telescope, is all we have for the village
of St. Kilda, a watering-place in the environs of Melbourne. And
directly across the bay, in a straight line with Melbourne on the
map, are seen a number of small tenements on the beach, with wooden
jetties run out for the convenience of landing. But although the
city is not more than two miles from this beach, there is no part
of it visible from the shipping, except the telegraph-station for
signalling the arrival of ships in harbour, for the information of
the inhabitants. Looking north, you see the entrance to the
Yarra-Yarra river, which flows through Melbourne; and as you can
see up the stream for a mile or two, you may judge of the
circuitous course of its channel to the city, nine miles distant.
On the western shore, objects of a more defined character vary the
landscape. Williamstown, with its stone-built houses, within a mile
of the shipping, and the lighthouse on Gellibrand's Point, present
substantial tokens of the industry of the colonists. But the most
enlivening part of the scene was the bay itself, with its fleet of
square-rigged vessels, from whence issued the usual cheering sounds
of sailors loading and unloading cargo into the lighters alongside.
Here, we were informed by the captain, our journey ended, as ships
of our tonnage can approach no nearer to the capital town of the
colony, in consequence of a rocky bar at the entrance to the river;
steamboats and sailing vessels, however, of not more than 200 tons,
can accomplish this with safety, and reach the wharves right in the
heart of the city.</p>

<p>From our experiences gleaned upon the occasion, we noted the
following memoranda in our journal, which may prove useful to
subsequent travellers and emigrants. That ships of large tonnage,
such as make the voyage out from England, and are advertised to
sail for the port of Melbourne, proceed no further than Hobson Bay,
situated, as the reader will have observed, at the northern
extremity of Port Philip harbour, twenty-seven miles from its
entrance in Bass's Strait. That such vessels are not moored
alongside any wharf or dock, but lie at anchor in this bay within
half a mile or a mile of Williamstown, the nearest point of
landing. That there are two ways of proceeding to Melbourne: one by
steamboat up the river, nine miles; the other by taking a
ferry-boat across the bay, and walking from the beach overland, two
miles. And that, upon passengers disembarking, they have to pay for
the hire of boats or lighters, to convey themselves and their
luggage or merchandise on shore; for this purpose there are
abundance of boats plying between the shipping and the beach, under
control of the local authorities, who fix the rate of fares to be
charged, a copy of which every boatman is bound to produce when
called on by a passenger. Steamboats ply between Williamstown and
Melbourne every two hours or so, the Geelong boats being the most
comfortable. The preliminary expenses attending the disembarkation
of passengers at this most inconvenient port come very heavy upon
their purses in the present altered state of the labour, market. We
would advise gentlemen and families, therefore, not to hamper
themselves with much bulky luggage, furniture, or merchandise.</p>

<p>As the day advanced, we were boarded by the port officer and
other officials, who went through their business in an off'-hand
manner that was quite delightful, compared to the fusty old routine
of the port of London. These gentlemen confirmed every thing we had
heard of the recent discovery; and our vessel was soon afterwards
besieged by the townspeople, on the look-out for servants and
mechanics. In their conversations with our 'tween-deck and steerage
passengers, they dwelt less eloquently upon the abundance of this
new product; and several earnestly dissuaded them, with great
truth, not to attempt proceeding to the gold mines without some
colonial experience. They represented the gold-seeker's life as
surrounded with no common hardships; that it was only fit for the
old "bushmen" of the colony, who were inured to the life. It was
worse than working from morn to night at the hardest roadside
drudgery in England; and the man unaccustomed to hard labour would
sink under it. Besides, it was more or less a lottery; for although
many had been fortunate in collecting large quantities, yet the
majority of the diggers made little more than an ordinary living,
after the expense of provisions, which were dear at the mines, had
been taken into account. No one, however, was inclined to engage
until they got to Melbourne, and ascertained the state of affairs;
so there was a general move on shore soon after breakfast by the
majority of the passengers.</p>

<p>Engaging a boat, we threaded our way through the shipping
towards Williamstown. As we passed many of the vessels with their
yards apeak, they seemed to be deserted, which we were told was
actually the case; in one or two instances, the captains had
followed their men to the diggings. We landed at Williamstown upon
a rough stone jetty, more substantial than elegant. Upon arrival,
new-comers are pleased with the aspect of this small township, from
its being the first which greets them in Australia when bound for
this port, and from its possessing some good stone-built houses,
stores, and hotels. But it is a place of very little importance in
the colony, although from its advantageous situation, it should
have become the principal sea-port in Victoria; the drawback to its
success is the want of fresh water, which is not to be found in its
vicinity, and the inhabitants are actually obliged to send to
Melbourne for every drop of fresh water they use. It can easily be
imagined, therefore, in these gold-digging times, that this
necessary article would cost much to bring down. We read in the
newspapers that <i>one pound seven shillings</i> was given for a
load of water, for the use of the watch-house, a load being 300
gallons. As we saw no use of idling our time away in this poor
place, we went on board the next steamer for Melbourne, which was
the <i>Aphrasia</i> from Geelong, as smart a river boat as any on
the Thames or Mersey. There was a large company of people on board,
of all classes, and from all parts of the country, amongst whom we
freely mixed, and conversed upon all subjects. In that short voyage
from Williamstown to Melbourne we obtained a more correct estimate
of the character of the colonists, and the resources of the
province, than we had gathered from all the books we had ever read.
Therefore, gentle reader, in the following unvarnished narrative,
we shall only expect to convey to you but a shadowy knowledge of
the substance which exists in that land of realities. You must go
there and judge for yourself; you should hear the clear hearty
laugh of those prosperous colonists, to estimate fully the hilarity
of Australian temperaments; you must breathe the air of that
intensely blue sky, to conceive the bright glaring
matter-of-factness which reigns over the material world of
Australia; you must listen to the graphic and truthful expressions
of the people, to credit the buoyancy and activity with which the
perceptive and imaginative faculties come into play in that sunny
clime. For ourselves, we felt at once, as we paced the deck of the
Geelong steamboat, that we had already mingled in the business of
the colony, and we talked and laughed with people who were perfect
strangers to us with something approaching to familiarity; we did
not feel that we were in a strange land; the voices, the faces, the
manners of the people were a reflection of our own; and we appeared
to be steaming up some quiet river in the old country upon a summer
excursion.</p>

<p>First impressions are not always to be relied upon for their
correct judgment of men and things; still we are of opinion that,
when faithfully related, they convey to others the general
character of both, which subsequent experiences give in detail, and
rarely obliterate from the memory. Such, at all events, were our
first impressions the day we landed on the shores of Australia; and
however much we may have forgotten the beauty or novelty of scenes
afterwards lingered upon, we have not forgotten them. After leaving
the ship&mdash;which seemed the last link in the chain that bound
us to the old hemisphere&mdash;we felt as if a cloak of prejudices
had fallen from our shoulders, and we were relieved from the
burden. Those superstitious feelings which are cherished so much
amidst the gloomy ruins and dark skies of the north, had apparently
not travelled so far with us. Even the pleasing romantic notions we
had entertained of this far-off land before starting fled from our
recollection the moment we put foot on shore. We could not imagine
fairies to haunt those dry open thin-leaved forests, or ghosts to
hide themselves from the clear daylight or moonlight which
prevailed. These impressions never left us during our sojourn in
these unromantic every-day-looking regions. Our imagination became
divested of all ideas of grandeur or romance upon viewing the
occupations of the people, or the quiet scenery of the country.
Amongst the former, we saw merely an industrious community, toiling
and labouring for a subsistence or an independence, which came
readier to the hand than in other lands; and as the latter opened
upon us at intervals, we seldom found the prevailing features of
the mountains and valleys, the plains and forests, the rivers and
lakes, soaring into the sublime; more frequently they revelled in
the beautiful, and as rarely sunk into the insignificant as they
fell into the monotonous.</p>

<p>With the flood-tide in our favour, we entered the Yarra-Yarra
river, signifying in the aboriginal language "flowing-flowing,"
from the circumstance of its containing always a current of fresh
water, while other streams become merely chains of ponds in the dry
season. At its entrance, two miles north of Williamstown, it
appears to be about a mile wide, its eastern bank being low
marshland, with very few trees on it, and the western bank a stony
ridge, with stunted gum-trees upon it, scarcely dense enough to be
called forest-land. For about three miles you ascend the river in a
northerly direction, retaining its width pretty nearly all the way,
when it suddenly narrows into a small stream, not more than two
hundred yards wide; and this is again lessened a little further on,
where it is divided into two branches, what appears to be the main
branch still continuing in a northerly direction, the lesser stream
meeting it at a right angle from the eastward. The former is called
the Salt-water river, and ceases to have the appearance of a river
ten miles from this junction; the latter is the Yarra-Yarra, which
derives its source from a range of mountains, known as the Snowy
Mountains, fifty miles to the eastward. About fifty years ago, this
river was ascended by government surveyors, to report upon its
capabilities for the formation of a settlement. Pursuing the
northern branch, which they found destitute of fresh water, they
entirely overlooked the main stream, and reported the harbour to be
unfit for the occupation of settlers, or even for ships to water
at.</p>

<p>The river at this junction, and up both branches, assumes that
peculiar character so frequently met with amongst the Australian
streams. Passing through the blackest alluvial soil we ever saw,
and imparting to its waters a strange inky hue, it flows between
such soft, abrupt banks, covered with dense brushwood to the
margin, that it looks more like a canal than a natural current of
water; you can see no bottom, not within a foot of the edge; and we
were informed that it was as deep there as in the middle. It has
not the shelving bed or pebbly beach which we find enclosing the
streams of Europe,&mdash;those pleasant sloping banks which lend
such a charm to the scenery on the murmuring streams of our
motherland. As we ascended the river we saw the carcass of a
bullock floating past, which no doubt had fallen in while
endeavouring to drink. Many are thus lost annually, as it is
impossible for the poor creatures to climb, with their heavy
bodies, up the steep soft banks of the river.</p>

<p>Emerging from these brushwood reaches, which form the tortuous
part of the stream, you open up to view an extensive swamp on the
left bank, the land around it being hilly and open. Upon its
eastern margin you can discern some houses of substantial structure
on the rising ground, and on the flat below a few scattered
cottages of mean appearance, with sheep and cattle pens near them:
this is the west-end of the city of Melbourne. The approach,
therefore, by the river gives to the stranger rather an
unfavourable impression of the town. Further on, tall chimneys
begin to appear; then a goodly forest of masts belonging to small
coasting vessels, which are enabled to cross the bar at Hobson Bay.
Through these the steamer cautiously threads her way, as they line
the banks of the river, besides a few which you pass in a small but
snug wet dock, behind which are seen several steam flour-mills,
with many large and substantially built warehouses, close to which,
and facing the river, is an ordinary-looking street, with shops and
taverns of similar character to those seen in the sea-port towns of
England, with all its attendant noise and bustle of drays loaded
with goods from the shipping. As the vessel nears the Queen's
Wharf, where you land, the market-square, situated upon rising
ground, and closed in by substantial rows of houses, gives a more
favourable aspect to the town; still the site does not appear one
of the most convenient for the cartage of merchandise from the
wharfs. At this point the river expands into a basin, the tide
rises no higher, and navigation ceases; here the water is salt,
above it is fresh: a dam built across the river upon a natural rock
divides the two waters. The town is situated on the north bank of
the river, above the point of navigation principally, extending in
this direction upwards of two miles. Facing the dam is the
custom-house, a compact ornamental building, built of a dark
reddish sandstone. To this office we directed our steps immediately
we landed, to pass the necessary entries for our luggage; after
which we strolled into the town, and took up our quarters at the
<i>Royal Hotel</i>, Collins Street.</p>

<p>As it is necessary to jog one's memory often regarding the
correct geographical position and denomination of these new cities
at the antipodes, we note for the information of the reader, that
Melbourne is the capital city of the province of Victoria, situated
on the Yarra-Yarra river, which flows into Port Philip harbour at
Hobson Bay. By the last general census in 1851, it contained 23,143
inhabitants. As we shall devote a chapter to the further
description of this rapidly increasing town and its environs, after
we have given our narrative of a visit to the gold-diggings, the
reader will excuse our giving any detailed account of it in this
place.</p>

<p>The Christmas holidays were now drawing to a close, so we
resolved upon visiting the far-famed gold-fields of Victoria
without further loss of time; our first visit being directed
towards Mount Alexander, whither multitudes were now wending their
way, that we might not only gratify our curiosity, but also satisfy
ourselves of the truth or otherwise of their prodigious yield; and
also, as near as possible, the actual state and disposition of the
diggers. During our short journeys out of Melbourne and our visits
to the townships in its environs, we had had opportunities of
seeing much of these men <i>en route</i> to the diggings, and those
who had just returned. Among them were men of all classes: the
hard-handed able-bodied labourer and the slender soft-fingered man
from the desk; those who had been successful, and those whom
fortune had not yet favoured. We soon became accustomed to their
rough exterior, and in our communications with them experienced
great civility; and as the mass of those who had left their
occupation for a short time to enjoy themselves during the holidays
were not different from other men, and not particularly formidable
in their appearance, though unshaven, we had great doubts of the
accuracy of the statements and reports of feverish-minded people as
to the absence of all order and security of person and property at
Mount Alexander. No doubt there had been much excitement occasioned
by the government intention to increase the amount of the monthly
license from thirty shillings to three pounds; of which excitement
much had been made for the moment by the absurd cry, that the
government intended the measure as a blow against the labouring
man. That there were irregularities, and also some cases of crime
committed amongst them, we do not deny; and such cases there will
always be, more or less, among such masses of men; not more,
however, we venture to say, than there would have been among any
other population under similar circumstances. In truth, among the
real Port-Philippian gold-diggers then in town, clad in their
peculiar plaid or chequered jumper, there appeared to us more of
fun and frolic than of viciousness. And although subsequent
accounts describe the prevalence of crime to be alarmingly on the
increase both in Melbourne and at the diggings, yet we are of
opinion that among the depredators who are stated to infest the
town and country, few Port-Philip men will be found. It is more
than likely, as that impartial newspaper the <i>Melbourne Argus</i>
affirms, that they consist of the escaped convicts from Van
Diemen's Land, and other desperate characters from the neighbouring
colonies, who have been attracted with the multitude to the
superior gold-fields of Victoria. The measures adopted by the home
government in dispatching a large body of the metropolitan
constabulary, as well as an addition to the military force, will
soon, we hope, restore the colony to its former tranquillity.</p>

<p>Such being the view we took of the state of the population, we
prepared our equipment accordingly, and on the 27th December we
were among those who left Melbourne for Mount Alexander. Having
purchased a good and serviceable horse for the occasion, we stuffed
our saddle-bags with a supply of biscuits, tea and sugar, and slung
a quart pot and pint pannikin at our saddle, with a blanket
strapped on in front rolled up in a piece of oilskin. We of course
were armed, not because we were apprehensive, but you feel more
confidence in knowing that you would not altogether be without
defence, or at the mercy of any fellow who might speculate upon
taking you unawares.</p>

<p>Mount Alexander is about seventy-five miles north-west from
Melbourne, in the Mount Macedon district, and the road is generally
good at this season; but in winter, or in rainy weather, there is a
great difficulty for drays, or indeed any vehicle, to travel along
it. The country you pass through is open forest-land, and sometimes
it is quite free from trees. There is plenty of grass all the way,
and some excellent patches of arable land. All the settler had to
do in many places was to plough, to sow, and to reap, without
clearing the land, and to depasture his sheep on the uplands fresh
to his hand.</p>

<p>As you proceed out of town, the country becomes tolerably high,
so that you have a fine view of the city, the shipping, and the
distant mountains. Here and there are scattered good farm-houses
with suitable outbuildings and offices; some of these we visited,
which let for 1<i>l</i>. per acre. There are some very good
roadside inns at suitable places on the way, with a few houses
about them, which look like the commencement of future villages,
perhaps towns. It was rather too late in the year to see this
country to advantage; but nevertheless we saw much to admire and
gratify, in spite of the flies which tormented us. These
troublesome insects, so annoying at this season of the year, are of
the same size and shape as the ordinary English house-fly; but the
colonial fly has such a powerful sucking proboscis, that when it
perches upon the corner of your eye and inserts it, the irritation
is extremely painful. The best protection from their attacks is to
wear a veil, which is commonly done by bushmen; but the closeness
of this upon the face in the hot weather is extremely
uncomfortable, which made us prefer facing the plague to adopting
the remedy.</p>

<p>About twelve miles distant on the road we came to the Deep
Creek, the descent to which is very steep and precipitous. There
are spots upon the picturesque banks of this creek that are truly
beautiful, which, as time rolls on, will become favourite retreats
for the wealthy inhabitants from the heat of the towns. The inn at
this spot was crowded, and several hundreds had stopped for the
advantage of the water for their cattle. Those coming from the
diggings were riotously enjoying themselves at the inn; those <i>en
route</i> to them preparing for the night by first unyoking,
watering, and turning out their bullocks or horses, and then
proceeding to light a fire and otherwise prepare for their evening
meal, which, as usual, consisted of the bush fare, viz. tea,
damper, and mutton.</p>

<p>Other parties remained but an hour or two, and then proceeded
onward, stopping at some spot for the night where water and food
was to be obtained for their cattle.</p>

<p>A great many were on foot&mdash;that is, not belonging to a
party with a dray or cart. These men were labouring under wallets
of great weight, besides a blanket each. They had taken the chance
of the road and a rough bivouac. Many had knapsacks of the kangaroo
skin; these latter were generally from Van Diemen's Land. Of the
former many were runaway sailors, new-comers from Adelaide,
mechanics from the towns, day-labourers from the country, idlers
(of which there are always plenty in every community), and such as
had no means, but were determined to try their fortune, encouraged
by the success of others, and the reports, which almost deprived
men of their reason.</p>

<p>Every class in the community was represented here: merchants,
physicians, lawyers, responsible tradesmen, farmers, clerks; and
many of the superior classes were pointed out to us among the mass
we saw in this place and on the road. The successful diggers, or
those who were ambitious to be in the fashion, or somewhat
different from the sailor or bullock-driver, were generally clad in
the plaid or chequered jumper; every one had a belt round his
waist. Altogether the scene was very striking and picturesque, and
the costumes most useful for the labour their wearers had to go
through.</p>

<p>After a short time we resumed our journey, and on the way
overtook four men and a boy of about twelve years of age, perhaps
not so much; they were tired, and the little fellow was quite
knocked up. We got off our horse and walked with them, putting the
youngster on it; and thus we journeyed on for several miles. This
party had walked from Gipps' Land, two hundred miles. Mount
Alexander being the point of attraction where they hoped to work
out their fortunes, they had left their wives behind, making such
arrangements as they were able for their safety, and fearlessly
struck across the country, that they might reach the desired spot.
Where will this matter end? was our reflection. Here are men, and
one of them an intelligent one,&mdash;formerly a Devonshire farmer,
as he informed us,&mdash;who had settled in Gipps' Land, leaving
their families and settled occupations for a gold-seeker's life.
They stated that every man who could had left, or would leave that
quarter; and the same thing was going forward every where, either
for these diggings or for other localities. They regretted leaving
that district, of which they spoke highly, and described it as
altogether different from these sheep-walks and highlands, every
acre of it being fit for the plough. But what could they do? so
many labouring people had left, and so many employers of labour had
gone likewise, that in their case there was no alternative but to
follow.</p>

<p>A gentleman coming up spoke to us; he looked ill and fatigued;
he had had a very long walk after his horse in the morning, which
had strayed, not being properly secured; he determined, if
possible, not to be so served again, as he had procured a very long
and strong tether rope. He asked us where we proposed to stop for
the night, as we were a great distance from the "Bush Inn." At the
first place where water was to be obtained, was the reply of our
friends from Gipps' Land. We were now passing over extensive plains
without any trees upon them; and to all appearance we were a long
distance from water. On these plains there were a great many wagons
and drays, equestrians and pedestrians, passing to and from the
diggings, by whom me Gipps' Land party were informed that water was
to be had about two miles off the line of road, pointing towards
the spot; at that spot, therefore, they resolved to pass the night.
The young boy was then taken off our horse, we mounted, wishing our
friends good fortune, rode on, and soon overtook the stranger who
had spoken to us, and with him journeyed on; he was surprised at
our not going with the men, thinking, as we were walking, that we
were of one party. We found him to be a very agreeable person,
belonging to Melbourne, of some literary reputation, as we were
afterwards informed. He fully confirmed the statements in the
journals as to the productiveness of the gold-fields, and as to the
effect the discovery had had upon society generally; but he
indulged in the expectation that emigration, and the throwing back
upon the labour-market such persons as had tried and failed, or who
were unequal to the severity of the labour from any other reason,
would put all to rights; that in the meantime it was clear there
was nothing for many to do but to join in the scramble: such being
his view, it was either his pleasure or convenience to form a small
party, which was working at Forest Creek; that he had been in town
on some matter connected with the party, and was now returning.
From his appearance we thought such rough work would be too much
for him; but his weak state of health was probably the result of a
passing illness; mentally he was energetic enough, and we hoped he
would prove bodily so.</p>

<p>Being overtaken by the night, after we had ridden on a few miles
further through a really beautiful country, undulating and rising
into small hills, with that open forest-land so common to
Australian scenery, and being still six or eight miles from the
"Bush Inn," we began to look about us for a resting-place. At
length, among many fires, we directed our steps towards one. Around
it were some sailors belonging to a ship they had left at
Melbourne; their party consisted of five. The leader and another
man had gone back to town with a horse and cart for something they
required, leaving them in charge of the tent and other things until
they returned. They were smart young fellows, and very civil; with
them, therefore, we bivouacked. The creek was not running, and we
had therefore some difficulty in finding a water-hole to which we
could take our horses with safety. At length we succeeded, some
distance off; and then bringing them back, we secured them to the
trees in a spot where there was plenty of good grass, which they
seemed to enjoy. It will not be necessary to give a description of
our repast; suffice it to say we had plenty. We enjoyed the blazing
fire; and it is most important to provide a large quantity of wood
for fuel, or otherwise towards morning you will suffer from the
dews. The night was clear, and rather cold. In Australia they are
very brilliant; more so, we consider, than in similar latitudes in
the northern hemisphere. The stars appear intensely bright and
glittering. Our companion being ill, soon felt disposed to prepare
himself for the night, and these kind fellows gave him all they
could to add to his comfort. Being quite well ourselves, it was
late before we left the fire. There was not any thing to fear
personally, but as there had been several instances of some of the
gentlemen on foot <i>borrowing</i> horses without the leave of the
owners, it was necessary to be on the alert. However, all was well,
and we rested soundly, and very early in the morning were on the
road. Our fellow-traveller being still very ill, we pushed on to
the "Bush Inn," around which a little village has gathered, or
rather the commencement of one. It is delightfully situated in a
valley thirty-three miles from Melbourne, near to the commencement
of the Black Forest. The house itself is a very poor place,
however, the accommodation being but very indifferent, and
extremely dirty: allowances were to be made, certainly, from the
multitudes of people coming in and out; but the only thing the
innkeepers on this road appeared to think of was how to turn the
present chance to account; and there was no doubt but that they
were making large profits from the sale of liquor, a far more
certain mode than by digging for gold. We gave our horses a feed,
and after resting them sufficiently long, we determined to proceed,
preferring to trust to our own supplies rather than mix up in such
a scene as presented itself to us.</p>

<p>The Black Forest commences near this inn; it is a barren tract,
with iron and stringy bark trees, and such as are sure indications
of an inferior country. It was considered, however, to have very
much the character of a gold country, and it would not create
surprise in us to hear of some rich deposits being found there. It
is about eleven miles in breadth, but how long we did not learn;
the road from here passes Mount Macedon, which is on the right,
rising finely; and from a thousand points subjects worthy of the
painter are before you, with that dark and frowning mountain
forming a background. It is particularly striking as you descend to
the "Bush Inn."</p>

<p>This forest was a noted place for bush-rangers some years since;
and it may again be the resort of robbers, as the recesses of this
apparently inaccessible mountain would afford a good retreat, and
the forest itself is lonely enough for any outrage to be committed
there without fear of disturbance during its perpetration. The gold
will be a great temptation to the unlucky and desperate: it behoves
the government to be on the alert; by forming an efficient body of
mounted police, we have no doubt good order will be maintained, and
people enabled to travel in safety. The Council, however, must not
be niggardly; if good men are to be employed, they must be paid in
these golden times liberally, otherwise they will not get them.</p>

<p>In the midst of this forest we stopped for an hour, and managed
to make a very good meal.</p>

<p>Passing through the forest, we came to a small plain, at a place
called the "Five-Mile Creek;" the water was very good, but the
thousands of horses and bullocks passing up and down the road had
left no grass. From hence to Kyneton is about nine miles, through
good pasture-land, though in places we considered it somewhat too
wet and cold; but we were in a much higher country here than that
hitherto traversed on the road, and we expected this change of
temperature. From this point you keep on ascending gradually, until
you finally come to Forest Creek at Mount Alexander, thirty miles
distant.</p>

<p>At Carlsruhe, the next inn on the road, there is a chain of
ponds and an excellent house of accommodation. This, we were told,
it is the intention of the government to take possession of as a
protective station. There is much land here enclosed; and we do not
doubt but that the government will do that which is equitable to
the proprietors. Positions must be had on the road, and this offers
many advantages. We soon arrived at Kyneton, fifty-four miles from
Melbourne,&mdash;a good commencement of a village or town, having
its blacksmiths' and butchers' shops, stores, accommodation-houses,
&amp;c., and something like a street of small and very
uncomfortable-looking wooden houses. All the country around is very
good, open, and undulating, with plenty of water in a river a
little below, then in pools. There had lately been finished a large
hotel in this township called the "Robert Burns," which in sober
times would have afforded every comfort that could be wished for;
now, however, all is riot and confusion. If such is to be the
result of this gold discovery, Victoria may be a country to make
money in, but not to enjoy life.</p>

<p>On the road we had been joined by an acquaintance of our sickly
companion, an elderly man, who had formerly possessed considerable
means; but fortune had not been favourable, and he was now
proceeding to the diggings with a party to court her smiles; he was
a most pleasant man for the road, he seemed to know and be known to
every one. He was the man for the occasion; and with his assistance
a capital supper was provided for us at the "Robert Burns," of
which, however, our sick friend was too unwell to partake. Rest was
the best thing for him; so amidst all the noise and confusion, he
went to his bed to seek that rest of which he was in such need.
Poor fellow! he must have had a miserable night of it; for the
floor of the room was covered with people, glad to get under cover
at any charge that might be demanded. And every room in the house
was the same; there must have been several hundred people on the
premises. After seeing our horses fed and stabled, we had some
supper; and having secured, as we thought, a shake-down, fell
asleep upon the sofa. It was well that we did so; for when we
inquired for our bed, and saw the sort of thing offered, we
preferred taking our chance at one of the bivouac fires not far
distant, than be exposed to the horrors of a crowded room and a
drunken atmosphere. The night was fine, and, though rather cold,
with our cloaks and blankets we managed to make it out famously;
and after a good wash, at early dawn we were ready to proceed on
our journey.</p>

<p>Our fellow-traveller was also up early, and we proceeded
together: he was much better, but very far from being well; and
notwithstanding the disagreeables of the night, he had slept
tolerably well, thanks to his being fairly worn out. We crossed the
Campaspie river at this place, over which there is a bridge a
little below the hotel; and passing through a well-watered and
beautifully undulating country for six miles, we reached the
Columbine, a clear stream running to the north, over which there is
a very indifferent bridge. At this spot we stopped, lighted a fire,
and partook of a good breakfast. This spot has been selected for a
township, for which it is well adapted, being not only a beautiful
site, but with plenty of wood and water and a rich country around
it. As we proceeded, the country still continued grassy and the
soil good; to the right of the road there is a considerable extent
of it enclosed. The view up and down the river is very picturesque
and park-like. In the distance are high hills. Mount Macedon rising
proudly, dark, and frowning, and Mount Alexander visible in the
distance, the country towards it rising gradually; on either side
is fine open forest-land, with an abundance of grass.</p>

question.</p>

<p>As you approach Mount Alexander from the Columbine river, the
country rises more abruptly to within about four miles of its base,
where you enter a slope between the hills which leads you over the
higher land, and you pass into a valley, at the bottom of which is
a creek: that is Forest Creek, which in all time coming will be
famous for the quantity of gold found in and about it. As we
proceeded, the tents of the diggers began to appear, increasing in
number for about a mile, at which point the valley appeared full of
tents, like the encampment of a large army. Although many parties
had gone away at this season of the year on account of the
deficiency of water, the Christmas holidays, and for other reasons,
there could not have been less than three thousand tents, and every
hour was adding to their number. About two miles into the valley we
came to the "Shepherd's Hut," which had been an out-station on the
run before the gold discovery. Here we met some old friends, with
whom we intended to pass the few days we should remain in this wild
though interesting locality.</p>

<p>The first night, however, we accepted the invitation, and
partook of the hospitality and shelter of our fellow-traveller from
Melbourne and his party at Golden Point, a considerable distance
further down the creek. A more extraordinary scene cannot be
imagined than what was presented at this point. The whole valley
had been torn up by the diggers: in the bed of the creek, and on
the rising ground on either side, and up the lesser valleys which
led into it, holes and pits were dug, from one to twenty feet deep.
The Commissioner had judiciously restricted the extent of these, so
as to afford room for the tents of the diggers and communication
between them.</p>

<p>The tents were in every place. The newspaper-offices,
eating-houses, and stores, of which there were a great number,
besides traffickers in gold, doctors, and such like, were
principally on the sides of the main road, and near the post-office
it was quite a village. From this spot the conveyances start for
Melbourne during the week; there is then a great crowd, and it is
the busiest locality in the valley. The diggings in this creek
extend for a distance of many miles, as much as ten or twelve, to
the Lodden river; the whole of the ridges and gullies running down
into it have proved very rich in their yield of gold, while many of
the back ranges and gullies have also produced good samples of
nuggets and dust. Two miles or more from the post-office further
down the creek the tent of the Commissioner appeared, well situated
on a rising ground; he was surrounded by several other tents, and
the scene would have made a good picture; around this official
locality the largest stores had been erected, while the whole space
was thickly covered with tents. At this spot Friar's Creek joins
Forest Creek, the diggings extending eight or ten miles at least
from the junction; the road, however, crosses the ranges a little
below, and in about five miles more it comes upon the creek.</p>

<p>There are many small hills in the valley now well known, such as
the Red Hill near the post-office, the Adelaide Hill, and the White
Hill, pointed out to the visitor as spots from which vast
quantities of gold have been obtained. And although they were the
localities where the diggings first began at the mount, they still
yield largely.</p>

<p>It was really astonishing to see the quantity of gold obtained:
the diggers were not satisfied with ounces! Unless they got pounds
in weight, they thought themselves doing badly. However, it would
be a great mistake to conclude, and would be untrue to state, that
all were picking up gold by the pound weight. Many could not pay
their expenses; but there have been fewer failures at Mount
Alexander diggings than those we afterwards visited in New South
Wales. There is no comparison between the Turon and these diggings,
in regard to the quantity of gold obtained, and the enormous
amounts realised by hundreds. It would be impossible, however, to
advise any one in this matter; fortune often favours the weak and
neglects the strong. We saw lads who, we were assured, had made,
and were making, from one to three ounces a day; while hard-working
and able men were pointed out to us who had not got a pennyweight,
and were compelled in consequence to hire themselves to live,
having expended all their means; but still desperately determined
to continue at the exciting employment, rather than fall back upon
the labour of the country, which so much needed them. Whilst we
were in a store purchasing some corn for our horses, a lad under
sixteen years of age brought some gold for the store-keeper to
weigh; there were nearly twenty-seven ounces of it, for which
2<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. an ounce was offered him; which he refused,
saying he thought he should get more. This gold was obtained from a
hole he had been permitted to work out by a party leaving it. He
went into the hole on the Saturday, and on Monday he was possessed
of the quantity here mentioned. The circumstance did not surprise
any one; for the fact of getting large quantities of gold was so
common, that people said only that the lad was lucky, and it would
be a good start for him.</p>

<p>To most people at a distance there appears some romance in
gold-digging; they are excited with the idea that they may kick up
a stone and find twenty pounds of gold under it, and cannot imagine
how people can refrain from seizing a pick and breaking every piece
of quartz they pass, to see if there is another monster nugget in
it. But this is all a delusion; gold-digging is a real downright
matter-of-fact trade; so many hours of common labourer's work, so
much gold; so many buckets of earth, so many ounces: and once a man
is amongst the diggers, he feels no more inclination to take a pick
in his hand for the chance of what he might turn up, than he would
to enter upon the labour of English navvies, whose allowance is
three cubic yards per day.</p>

<p>The labour is always great, and sometimes exceedingly so: a
great many fail; and the dirty work, mud, and slushing in water,
the wretched cooking and uncomfortable beds&mdash;if such as the
great mass have can be called beds&mdash;the discomfort of sitting
about in the open air between sundown and bed-time, and rising cold
and damp in the morning, besides the pain of training the body to a
severe and incessant labour, are so contrary to the habits of the
many, that few can stand the training. No one, therefore, should
think of attempting such work, unless he feels himself equal to any
exertion, mentally and bodily, and prepared to rough it in the
extremest sense of the term. It is very easy to distinguish those
who have been any length of time at work from the new arrivals, by
their worn and dirty dress, their beards, and their thin, lank
faces; for even the most healthy of them have a haggard appearance.
A few were complaining of dysentery, and some of them had bad eyes;
the latter occasioned by the flies, which are terribly annoying;
and the former generally goes its round amongst the new-comers,
though most of the men are remarkably healthy at this time of the
year; but the water in many places was very bad, and its ill
effects were much felt.</p>

<p>To this must be added the excessive heat, much greater in
consequence of all vegetation being destroyed. To convey an
accurate idea of the desolation around you is almost impossible.
These diggings being situated in a timbered country, the visitor
might expect to see some verdure under the leafy trees, contrasting
with the snow-white tents, and every thing to please the taste. How
different is the reality! The road, which winds along the creek
through the diggings, is, from constant traffic, exceedingly dusty;
and as the gusts of wind are very violent, every thing is covered
with it; and thus the white tent soon loses its freshness, and
becomes as sombre and as dirty as its neighbours. In the same way
such trees as have escaped the axe are dusted to an unnatural
brownness; even off the road the earth is so trodden by the
thousands who are constantly passing and repassing, that all
verdure is gone; there is not the least sign of it, all being
nearly bare and dusty; and as the summer advances, this locality
would have a dreary appearance. On the southern side of the creek
the ground is so torn up, that it resembles nothing we ever saw; a
stone-quarry does not quite convey an idea of it, still it is the
best comparison for the English reader; for the horses and cattle
which thronged the diggings had eaten off the grass on the hills
near the creek, and even cropped the shoots from the few shrubs
that grew among the roots, stripping every particle of verdure from
the ground, and exposing the jagged rocks on the bare surface, thus
presenting any thing but a pleasing picture to the eye.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the turbulent and criminal character of
the colonists congregated at these diggings. However, we shall only
speak of the people as we found them. There are a great many highly
respectable individuals in the world's estimation among these men,
though there is no difference in their appearance generally, the
occupation making it convenient to assume the ordinary digger's
costume. We invariably found them civil and kind; and we are
inclined to suppose that a great deal of what has been said about
the insecurity of life and property amongst them, has been made by
persons for some particular purpose of their own. No doubt,
disorders will from time to time break out among such a body of
people gathered together from all quarters; but we feel assured
that the great mass are for order and peace, and therefore the
government, by the wisdom and liberality of its measures, will have
nothing to fear. The question that agitates the minds of all
thinking men is, will these great discoveries be for good or for
evil? Whatever may be the result, these colonies will have to pass
through a fearful trial: agriculture, sheep, and stock have
hitherto been the pursuits of the colonists; following these
pursuits, they and the colony have prospered in a most remarkable
manner, and were going on to still greater prosperity, when gold
was discovered to an extent never before heard of&mdash;never
before even dreamed of; the rogue and vagabond of a month back, as
well as the honest hard-working labourer, mechanic, and men
accustomed only to small means, who never thought of realising more
than a competency, have become capitalists. But so far from decent
tradesmen and hard-working labourers becoming dangerous to society
by being thus independent and enabled to purchase land, the very
opposite of that is more likely to follow. Those who look forward
to party feuds between the squatters who have hitherto possessed
most influence in the colony, and gold-diggers who may now possess
it, will be disappointed, we hope, in their expectations that the
whole system of the colonial society will be inverted. They forget
that the moment a man, by fortuitous circumstances, is raised in
the social scale, his views with regard to wealth are changed, or
greatly modified; thus property, which was exposed to attack, would
receive the support of those men on their own account. A regular
flow of emigration, however, sufficient to supply all employments
may be counted upon; and the stockholder, instead of being one day
the master and next day the slave of his man, ill-served for
ruinously exorbitant wages, as we have heard many say, will have
servants at the rate which almost every settler prefers, fair to
the employed as well as employer. The large population will consume
the fat stock, and the settler will realise a price for the whole
carcass, instead of for a portion as at present; and the
accumulation of capital, and consequent desire to invest, will
cause a demand for stock and stations, and raise their market
value; so that the pastoral property of the country, instead of
being ruined by the gold discovery, will be more easily managed,
more productive, and more marketable than ever, if the whole matter
is fairly worked. Thinking in this way, we have no apprehensions
whatever, in the end, for the interests connected with the land. No
doubt much inconvenience may, and probably will, be felt in many
places from which labour has been withdrawn; but ultimately those
who are unsuccessful, and physically unfit for the work of a miner,
will fall back upon the land and improved wages, and by degrees
such labour will return to its old quarter. However, during the
progress of this change many may be ruined. If the presence of gold
is to constitute the El Dorado, here is the real El Dorado.
California must admit that its mines are outdone,&mdash;that
Britain's sun is not set,&mdash;that she still possesses within her
dominion an inexhaustible store of the coveted metal; that which
makes man mad, by inducing him to abandon the basis of his true
interest, viz. <i>industry</i>, for that which fevers him, and has
a tendency to make him look upon his fellow-men with envy and
distrust.</p>

<p>Avarice, it is impossible to deny it, is the prevailing passion
here; all other passions seem to give way to it; and those passions
and vices which too often are found accompanying it are showing
themselves. Our boasted Anglo-Saxon race seems not in this matter
superior to those races that have fallen when possessed of that
which the folly of man has permitted, by making gold the
representative of real property, the only great thing to be
desired&mdash;the only thing to give power and influence and
command of all that man seeks. At this moment the framework of all
industrial enterprise, which raised the colony to its present
state, is suddenly shaken. The passion for gold has drained away
the greater portion of the working population. When you hear the
labouring class say&mdash;suggested to them by some low
popularity-hunter&mdash;speaking of the flock-owners, with an oath,
"Oh, they have had their day!" one feels sad at reflecting on the
possible result of this discovery on society and feeling.</p>

<p>This scarcity of labour was severely felt by the stockholders:
bullock-drivers, stockmen, and shepherds' wages had doubled in many
places where men could be procured; and we heard of instances in
which flocks were left to take their chance, or several flocks were
put together. As we passed one of these flocks where two were put
under one man, the fellow said, "he would not stop there in such
times; that these were the days for labouring men!" Short-sighted
man! as if the abandonment of industry, though it may lead some to
fortune, will ever benefit society so much as following industry
perseveringly. Wages every where in the bush were enormously high;
30<i>s</i>. a week and rations for indifferent labour! As we passed
along, we inquired, and found that some had engaged men to reap
their crops, shortly expected to commence, at 1<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>.
an acre. These wages must be submitted to, or the crop lost. But
will the land generally be cultivated again? Time will determine
that; at any rate the farmers, with such prospects before them, are
more likely to take a turn at the diggings than follow their
necessary occupation; if so, what will be the state of the country?
What will those people do who are unable to be gold-diggers, either
from age, infirmity, or sex, or from any other cause? It was such
reflections passing through our mind that induced us to address the
Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria upon the subject, and enclose to
him a memorandum on the gold question, which the reader will find
in <a href="#ch-18">Chapter XVIII</a>.</p>

<p>If we were in power, we should be intensely anxious until the
principle submitted was acted upon; after it was, we should have
great hope that by raising other interests we should negative the
evil effects of gold,&mdash;effects that have been injurious to all
people hitherto possessing goldmines. Gold, like every other thing
bestowed by a bountiful Creator upon man, has nothing in itself
that is injurious; it must, therefore, be the mode in which
communities treat it that makes it so. The whole matter, however,
is a currency question&mdash;a question few comprehend, and upon
which in all countries there is a great difference of opinion. We
have seen gold selling at Mount Alexander at 2<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>.
and 2<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. the ounce, and it has been sold
nominally as low as 2<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. by those in extremity,
while the same gold has realised 4<i>l</i>. in England. These are
fine times for the store-keepers, who make an enormous profit upon
every thing; they and the buyers of gold would, of course, object
to any regulations which are calculated to interfere with their
enormous gains: but the government has a duty to the people to
perform; and its profit and its interest, and in this case its
duty, should induce it to adopt some course which would be a
protection to the hard-working miner, and at the same time take
care of all other interests in the community.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December, 1851&mdash;the close of that memorable
year in the history of Australia&mdash;we visited the Friar's Creek
diggings, which form a portion of the auriferous deposits around
the golden mount. Our gold-digging friends were very desirous to
obtain every information concerning that locality; and we were but
too glad of the opportunity to show them how much we appreciated
their kind hospitality&mdash;a hospitality so freely proffered
where the most selfish passions of our nature are supposed to be
brought into play. Nor during our stay amongst those people did we
see the hungry man or newly-arrived digger refused a bit of damper,
or a pot of tea where it was to be had, and welcome; and those who
opened their larders most liberally were the older hands of the
colony, who had been nurtured in the hospitable manners of the
patriarch settlers. The fear was, that the influx of new-comers,
who had never experienced the well-known hospitality of the
country, would lessen the display of this kindly feeling by a want
of reciprocity, and be the means of creating a bad feeling between
them; for in no part of the world is the inhospitable man contemned
more than in the bush of Australia.</p>

<p>Friar's Creek and Forest Creek are both tributaries of the
Loddon river, which forms one of the southern branches of the Great
Murray river. The former creek joins the Loddon about ten or twelve
miles from the "Shepherd's hut" at Forest Creek. Between the two
creeks there is a range of hills, the distance apart being about
five miles. These hills are intersected by veins of mineral quartz,
presenting all the usual indications of gold; there is, in fact,
nothing to distinguish Forest Creek or the ranges in its vicinity,
with their iron-sandstone, quartz-rock, and slaty broken ridges and
ravines, from thousands of similar localities throughout the
colonies of Victoria and New South Wales. And upon testing the soil
of these ranges, the government geologists have already discovered
indications of the gold alluvium over 400 miles of country; and
every month is adding fresh workings to those already known.
Similar ranges also are stated to extend as far west as the
Pyrenees, and as far south as Wilson Promontory, crossing 500 miles
of country; and from that point along the whole Australian
cordillera as far as Cape York, 1500 miles to the northward, the
same formation occurs. What an exhaustless field is here for the
gold-seeker! We are not speculating widely, when we state that time
will show that the few holes scraped out since the first diggings
on the Bathurst mountains are but the commencement of the gigantic
operations which are yet to follow. The pursuit is but in its
infancy; and generations to come have before them untold treasures
in the auriferous deposits of Australia.</p>

<p>A knowledge of this should curb the hasty enthusiasm of those
who are going unprepared for the hardships they will have to
encounter, when a little delay might place them in more favourable
circumstances. It is as absurd to suppose that the richest
localities have already been found, as it is to imagine that fresh
veins will be generated in the matrix of the rocks; both of which
erroneous conjectures have been promulgated by people in the
colonies who pretend to a scientific knowledge of the subject. A
further consideration of this question ought to suggest likewise to
future gold-seekers the adoption of more judicious and systematic
methods of washing and raising the auriferous earth; also a better
regulation of the hours of working and repose; more comfortable
descriptions of dwellings; and especially an improved arrangement
in cooking their food and partaking of meals, which would be more
conducive to their health and comfort. A little time spared from
their labours for such purposes could never be considered
ill-spent, neither would a few extra pounds be thrown away. No
sooner does a party come upon the ground to commence operations
with their licenses in their pockets, than they rush like madmen to
their task, without any concern for their future comfort, which
they feel all the more if they are unsuccessful. When we passed
tents and "gunyas" in such a state of confusion and filth inside,
that a pig would have turned up its snout in disgust at them, we
considered that cleanliness and order could be maintained even
here, if the greedy occupants would but spare a little time from
their exciting work. Many, however, gloried in the dirt that
surrounded them, and prided themselves on their dirty attire.</p>

<p>As we descended the range, following the bed of the creek, in
which there was now no water, the abandoned diggings were very
numerous; those who had been at work had been driven away for the
present. As soon, however, as there was water, they would
recommence their labours; and from what we have since heard, the
most extraordinary success attended them. Proceeding in the same
direction for a mile or so, we came to where the valley widens, and
where the labours of the people had been prodigious. Enormous holes
had been sunk in the bottom of the valley, and on the sides of the
hills not a stone was left unturned. Though there were still many
men about, yet the greater part of them had been driven away from
the want of water.</p>

<p>At these dry diggings the discomforts of the diggers were
enhanced by the great distance they had to go for water. A good
wash was a luxury they rarely enjoyed; and few of them undressed on
retiring to rest. In fact, these ordinary attentions to the toilet
were of little avail to protect them from the dust blown about in
all directions by the wind. So far, allowances are to be made for
the dry-diggers. Inside and outside their tents and gunyas, every
thing was of the same dingy, dusty hue. Even the victuals could not
be protected from the palpable powder, which we felt by the sand
crunching amongst the chops between our teeth: and yet we must
qualify our judgment of these discomforts by stating, that they did
not appear much greater than those endured by the Irish labourer,
who is sifting lime or sand in England for a shilling or eighteen
pence a-day. Our estimate of the discomforts of a gold-digger's
occupation are those which would be endured by a person
unaccustomed to manual labour. Fatigue, hardship, and discomfort,
under these circumstances, are entirely comparative. What the
brawny armed navigator would consider merely ordinary work at the
diggings, the slender-limbed office-man would account frightful
labour. And so the hod-man who lives amongst dust and lime,
swallowing the dry particles, and allowing his clothes to drop off
his back hardened by their amalgamation, would find no fault with
the discomforts of a gold-digger's life. He would be as much at
home lying down in his dirty clothes for weeks together, in a tent
or bark gunya, as he was at home on his straw pallet in his mud
cabin. Place a man, however, in the same situation, who has been
accustomed to all the artificial manipulations of the toilet, with
whom such habits have become a second nature, and then the loss of
the ordinary comforts of civilised life cannot even compensate for
the golden rewards of his dirty labour. Hence, in judging of the
amount of privation which the gold-seekers undergo in Australia,
and of the hardships they describe, we should be guided by the
stamina of the men and the former habits of the writers.</p>

<p>In our perambulations down the valley of the creek we saw a fine
young man&mdash;the son of a neighbouring settler we were told, who
had been accustomed to take charge of stock upon a
cattle-station&mdash;at the bottom of a hole digging and pitching
up the earth; he was in a dreadful state of perspiration, when,
resting for a moment, he looked up to his brother, and exclaimed,
in a most dismal tone, "Oh, Frederick, this is dreadful!&mdash;what
a change it is from our pleasant life at home!" Although accustomed
to what is called a rough life in the bush, even this young man
felt the toils of a gold-digger's occupation more than he could
bear. What must not those feel who have proceeded thither fresh
from the towns and cities in the mother country, arriving on the
ground without the slightest experience of what colonial roughings
are? If the clerk from a banking-house or a merchant's office is
inclined to lay down his pen and take to handling the pickaxe and
shovel as a gold-digger, we do not say nay, provided he marches to
the field of operation with the requisite physical energy and
habits necessary to encounter the hardships attending this novel
pursuit. The extent, however, to which these qualifications will be
taxed in such a sphere, few individuals who have been unaccustomed
to hard labour are aware of. And it is a great and mighty change to
the office-man from any of the large cities of the United Kingdom,
to give up all his comforts, and amusements for this rude life in
the mountains of Australia, even though they be strewed with gold.
Many, we are certain, will wish themselves again in "Old England."
However, in this matter it is useless to advise; for the love of
gold will make men encounter a vast deal more than the fatigue of
procuring it at the diggings.</p>

<p>A hole sixteen feet deep was pointed out to us from which one
hundred and fifty pounds weight of gold had been taken out by one
man of the name of Darcy. This statement was confirmed by the
Commissioner with whom he had deposited the gold, valued at upwards
of 7000<i>l</i>. sterling. Other instances were mentioned where
enormous sums, such as 10,000<i>l</i>. worth of the precious metal,
had been obtained by parties of four and six from similar holes,
eight, sixteen, and eighteen feet deep, where they came upon the
golden earth. The luck of such men made others almost mad. But the
severe labour and exposure, the illness and bad fortune some had to
endure and put up with, checked the enthusiasm of many, although
the general success kept up the mania. All persons in this locality
were doing well; none had been unsuccessful in procuring more or
less of the gold. The surface-diggings were very rich even to the
summit of the hills; and as much as 6<i>l</i>. a-day per man had
been obtained. So easily was it found, that we picked out some
specimens from the root of a tree, which, in its fall, had torn up
much earth: the roots of this tree had been well picked; but there
was some gold still left. A party of Ayrshire men, whom we entered
into conversation with, had obtained, they said, thirty pounds
weight of gold in one month from holes and from surface-diggings.
From them we received some specimens of gold in ironstone.</p>

<p>Those parties of four, six, and eight, whom we have mentioned,
worked extremely well together, because they were all on an
equality; no one was master: the cradle-rocker of this week was
cook next week; each one took the other's job by turns; and all
shared equally in the collections of gold. Nowhere did we come
across any large body of men working under a superintendent, or
belonging to a public company. The most intelligent men we spoke to
upon the subject were doubtful of such companies succeeding; they
said, at the best they would never be able to compete with
individual enterprise, and it would be almost impossible to keep a
large party of fifteen or twenty men together; it would be
constantly liable to be broken up by the men deserting, after all
the trouble and expense of bringing them free from England to the
field of operation. And although the most stringent arrangements
could be entered into in the colony between such companies and
their servants, it would be impossible for the managers to enforce
their agreements in the lawless localities of the gold-diggings.
From these opinions, we have great doubts whether any of the Gold
Companies, which this discovery has given rise to in London, will
be effectually carried out, however honest their promoters, or
however efficient their officers may be. As to those which may be
termed Bubble Companies, formed by designing knaves to dupe the
public, we need only mention the case of one, to put people on
their guard how they invest, where 20,000<i>l</i>. of the money
subscribed by the shareholders was <i>bonâ fide</i> paid for a
tract of land in the colony, reputed, upon the most flimsy
evidence, to contain gold alluvium and gold quartz; but which has
turned out, upon examination, to be destitute of any mineral wealth
whatever. In all these companies we have remarked, that there are
exaggerated plans set forth with regard to their management on the
field. They make a grand parade of sending out scientific engineers
to conduct their operations, and talk of erecting large
steam-engines, and expensive mining machinery at the diggings, as
if gold-digging in Australia were the same as mining in Cornwall,
where both the overseers and miners have to serve long
apprenticeships before they are qualified for their tasks. Such
means and appliances may be profitably used where difficulties are
to be contended with in extracting metals from their ores by
chemical methods; and mining we take to be a process of working
metalliferous minerals by great skill and machinery; but to call
this simple process of washing sand and gravel mining is absurd:
they might as well designate ordinary gravel-pits mines, and
propose that scientific engineers should superintend the loading of
the carts.</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no water in the creek to wash the
gold-earth, the diggers were necessitated to cart it to the Loddon
river, distant about three miles. In this case they were obliged to
pay separately for carting it; for which they were charged fifteen
shillings per load. It was put into bags for this purpose, which
were carefully emptied at the washing-ground. This nearness to the
Loddon is a great advantage to the diggers upon Friar's Creek. That
river is a beautiful clear running stream, the water of which is
excellent. And there was even at that dry season plenty of good
grass for horses and cattle, which was very much required at Forest
Creek. The scenery upon the banks of the stream at this spot was of
that quiet, park-like aspect which characterises the sheep-runs in
the vicinity of this golden mount. To us it was a pleasing relief
to the parched appearance of the gullies&mdash;as the small valleys
are termed in Australia&mdash;in and around Friar's Creek, and its
neighbour Forest Creek. But to the gold-digger it appeared a
perfect El Dorado, where he had such abundance of water at command
to wash the auriferous soil. And so they went joyfully to work,
singing, talking, and laughing as they rocked their cradles by the
margin of that murmuring stream. There was more of the romance of
gold-digging upon this spot than any where we had yet visited.</p>

<p>We presume that every one who has taken up this book, and read
thus far, has become acquainted with the ordinary method of
gold-washing in Australia:&mdash;that the earth which contains the
gold is dug out by one man, and pitched on the side of the hole,
when they have to excavate for it; from whence it is carried by
another man to the cradle, which is generally some distance from
the excavation, and handy to the water. Here it is thrown into the
washing-machine, which is now well known to resemble an ordinary
child's cradle, and there mingled with copious supplies of water,
thrown on by a third member of the party; while a fourth rocks the
cradle violently by a handle attached to one side near the head:
unlike the gentle soothing motions which watchful nurses apply to
that piece of nursery furniture just named; for it is not the
purpose of the gold-seeker to lull the contents of his cradle to
rest, but to wake it up. When a sufficient quantity of earth is
washed in this maimer, to satisfy the cradle-rocker that there is a
likelihood of some gold being found in the bottom of the
cradle&mdash;where it settles in consequence of its greater
density, while the particles of earth with which it is mixed are
carried off&mdash;the residue is taken out and washed in a tin dish
to clear it from any sand or gravel still left, when the gold-dust
is carefully collected. The larger pieces&mdash;or nuggets as they
are termed&mdash;are picked out before the mass of earth reaches
the bottom of the cradle; as there are generally one or two
gratings at the head of the machine to intercept the stones which
are mingled with the earth. To furnish the intending gold-digger
with more valuable practical information on this head, we subjoin
here some memoranda carefully drawn up from the statement of a
successful and intelligent digger, a Lancashire man, named W. B.
Garrett. And as these gold-diggings at Mount Alexander have been so
much spoken of, perhaps they will be interesting to the general
reader, as they are couched in language so as to be understood by
all classes.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrett says:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"At the surface-diggings the gold is found
lying on the very top, to the depth of from 6 to 14 inches, and
sometimes still deeper; these diggings have always been on the face
or side of the hills, and generally those hills facing east and
south-east. It is found in all sorts of earth, excepting the black
alluvial soil, in or amongst gravelly earth, and small quartz, in
hard marly clay. The average yield of this sort of diggings is
about an ounce to a cart-load of earth, and three men with a cradle
can dig up and wash six or seven loads per day: it was this sort of
diggings that a party of three, to which I belonged, obtained in
eleven days 37 ozs. 2 dwts. each. But some of the surface-diggings
yield much more. In some particular spots, parties of three or four
have obtained 300, 400, and 500, and even in one instance 800
ounces in two or three days; but taking them altogether, they yield
about an ounce to a load of earth.<br>
<br>
"In sinking, the deepest of the holes might be eighteen or twenty
feet, certainly not deeper, and the shallowest two, three, and four
feet, so that the average would be about eight or ten feet. As they
keep sinking, they try a dishful of the earth occasionally, until
they find that it will pay for washing. They frequently find a few
particles from within a couple of feet from the top. But they in
general have to go within a foot of the rock before they find it to
pay them; it is then found sometimes in a hard marly substance. The
rocks, which are mostly blue or grey slate, are in general covered
with a few inches of tough clay, in which gold is seldom or ever
found. But on the top of the clay a bed of small gravel is found,
in which gold most abounds (the larger pieces are often embedded in
the clay). I have known many holes yielding an ounce per day to
three men abandoned as not paying, and given to new-comers, who
wanted a start; and the men generally considered themselves not
paid if they were getting less than an ounce per day each man. Many
holes have been left by parties just commencing as being
unprofitable, through not knowing how to work them; and others,
experienced hands, have gone into the same hole and done well.
Myself and two others went into an old hole abandoned by two
parties, and in about a fortnight got six pounds seven ounces each
man, driving our hole under three or four others that had not been
sunk down to the rocks. The sinking is always done in the gullies.
Holes in the very centre of the dip of the gullies are always the
richest. Quartz abounds in nearly every part of the gold-fields,
sometimes lying scattered on the surface; and in many places large
ridges of it are found sticking up out of the ground, forming an
angle with the earth of about 40° or 45°. In many places there are
alternate layers of iron-stone and quartz embedded together. The
iron-stone abounds most in and near the bed of the creek, where it
is found in immense blocks. The gold found amongst the ironstone in
and near the creek is often in large pieces, and much water-worn.
Specimens of gold and iron-stone have been found completely
amalgamated (a small one of which sort we possess). The scarcity of
water towards the latter end of the summer is much felt (the dirt
which is taken to the creek in large quantities for washing absorbs
it); and as water fails in the upper part of the creek, the diggers
move down towards the river Loddon.<br>
<br>
"The season for digging is about October to January, when the water
will fail until May, the beginning of winter, or rainy season.<br>
<br>
The diggers, as a body of men, were remarkably healthy; the only
disease at all prevalent was the blight, or disease of the eye
caused by the flies, which in all parts of Australia, are a
complete nuisance.<br>
<br>
"All the gold I have seen&mdash;and I have seen a great
deal&mdash;has the appearance (colour excepted) that lead would
have, if it was spilt or scattered in a molten state. Some few
grains are found quite globular or round, some in very fine dust,
some in thin scales, and much in partially flattened pieces of all
shapes and sizes; all, except the first, having the rough
appearance which new-cast metals have that have been cast in sand.
The gold found in the watercourses, or in those places where
water-courses formerly were, is, of course, more or less smooth or
water-worn; and that found on the sides of the hills, in what they
call the surface-diggings, is invariably the roughest, as having
been least exposed to friction, never having been in the
water-courses.<br>
<br>
"The colour of the gold is of different appearance in different
localities. All the gold procured in Victoria is of a beautiful
pale yellow, though not so pale as the Californian gold, having no
silver in it."</p>

<p>From what we gathered from other sources during our rambles
about these prolific golden creeks, we consider the foregoing
description and statements to be faithful and accurate. In fact,
however small a quantity was collected by those termed unlucky,
there was no man said to have left Mount Alexander, out of the tens
of thousands who had congregated there, without having some gold in
his pocket over and above paying expenses. So that although we have
considered the pursuit of gold-digging as having much of a lottery
in its nature, still it is not a lottery with few prizes and many
blanks. It may be compared with more justice to an Art-union
raffle, where, besides the chances of a valuable prize-picture,
every member is entitled to a print worth the value of his
subscription. In like manner, the gold-labourers at Mount
Alexander, besides the chances of a hundredweight of prize-nuggets,
may obtain by dint of perseverance an equivalent for the time and
labour expended on the employment. What a hopeful country this
Australia is for the able-bodied and industrious man! On every side
labour is rewarded beyond all calculations in the Old World. Here
there is no figurative speaking, but the literal fact stares us in
the face, that gold may be had for the gathering. This is no
Dick-Whittington story; for the stripling of fifteen we have seen
picking it up in handfuls, while the rude labourer with his brawny
arms and ten fingers has gathered it in heaps as no man hath done
before.</p>

<p>Now that we had witnessed to our satisfaction the great fact of
the gold-discovery in Australia, by seeing the colonists digging up
and washing the particles of gold from the earth before our eyes,
we bade our friends in the valley good-bye, wishing them every
success in their burrowings for the coveted metal. Nor was it with
feelings of regret that we turned our horse's head away from the
noise and dust of that canvass Babel on the golden mount, and
directed his steps towards the verdant pastures of the surrounding
country. At the same time we confess that, had we been free to act,
we most assuredly would have entered into the speculation in a
methodical manner; but we had a duty to perform which rendered that
out of the question. And as that duty led us subsequently to
examine carefully some of the largest pastoral and agricultural
farms in both of these gold-yielding colonies, besides enabling us
to visit the diggings in New South Wales, we had opportunities of
forming an impartial opinion of the condition of the country, and
judging of the conduct of its inhabitants, which rarely falls to
the lot of travellers in a newly-settled country like Australia. In
undertaking the journey we were no stranger to the exigencies of a
bush life, having experienced its roughings many years previous to
our leaving England upon this occasion, in the colonies of Western
Australia and Van Diemen's Land, South Australia and New Zealand,
Under the circumstances, therefore, we may be considered to have
re-visited Australia, which, we trust, will give additional weight
to our judgment of passing scenes and events. So, with perfect
confidence in our old acquired skill as "bushmen," we struck off
the main road as soon as we got out of the Forest Creek valley, and
plunged into the wide-spreading bush of Australia, our immediate
purpose being to visit a sheep-station some twelve miles distant
from the golden mount.</p>

<p>The term "bush," as it is used in Australia, is indiscriminately
applied to all descriptions of uncleared land, or to any spot away
from a settlement, as a person in England would speak of the
country when they are out of town. The general character of the
bush we were at this time journeying through was typical of a great
portion of the pastoral lands of Victoria. It consisted of
undulating open forest-land, which has often been compared, without
exaggeration, to the ordinary park-scenery of an English domain;
the only difference which strikes the eye forcibly being the dead
half-burnt trees lying about. To bring it home to the comprehension
of a Londoner, these open forest-lands have very much the
appearance of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, presenting natural
open glades like the east end of the former, and frequently
gladdening the eyes of the thirsty traveller with a glimpse of such
small sheets of water as the Serpentine, to which the colonists
apply the homely term of "water-hole." At the same time it must not
be supposed that the foliage of the trees in Australia has that
luxuriant appearance presented by the elm, the beech, or the
sycamore, which shade the sun's rays from the traveller like a
canopy on passing below them. On the contrary, although the
Australian gum-trees are not to be surpassed in height by the
noblest giants of the northern woods, yet their leaves are few and
scanty, while they hang from the branches with their edges upwards,
both sides of the leaf being the same, like the mistletoe-leaf;
hence the sun's rays are but slightly screened from above,
imparting a peculiar light to Australian forest-scenery, which
artists have found it difficult to copy. Of course it is known to
the most superficial observer that the European trees just named
have their leaves fixed horizontally on the branches, and that the
upper side of each leaf is different from the under. When light
therefore enters a forest with this description of foliage, it
comes sideways, as it were, like that from an ordinary window into
a room; whereas in the other it descends from above, like the light
from a cupola. Besides this peculiar structure of the foliage,
those trees are perennial evergreens, there is no fall of the leaf
in autumn, no denudation of the branches in winter, and no budding
in spring; throughout all seasons their foliage is the same. But as
if nature must have a renewal and decay annually, the old bark
peels off as a new one grows, the former hanging in long dry shreds
from the trunks of the trees. When it is considered that nine out
of every ten acres of bush-land in Australia is more or less
covered with this description of timber, you can imagine the
interminable region of the bush, its monotonous scenery, its
confined views of the surrounding country. From the deepest ravine
to the highest mountain-top those gum-trees rear unscathed their
iron arms. Over thousands of miles of hill and dale have those
everlasting trees met our wearied gaze. In the cleared lands of
Europe the traveller can see at a glance the varied landscape of
mountain and valley; but in the bush of Australia he can only catch
occasional glimpses of the distant country, when he is ascending or
descending a hill.</p>

<p>Through this description of forest-land we pursued our way
pleasantly. The day was clear and sunny, such as you can find in
Australia two hundred out of the three hundred and sixty-five. As
we cantered along the bush track, the riding was smooth and
agreeable, and the road felt soft and easy for the horse's feet.
Every now and then we scared flocks of the ground-parakeet, feeding
by the way-side as plentifully as sparrows in England, many of them
not much larger, and all of the most brilliant plumage; while
overhead the larger parrots and cockatoos were wheeling round and
round amongst the trees, and breaking the stillness of the forest
with their harsh and unmusical screams. The gorgeous livery of
these feathered denizens of the Australian bush are now familiar to
the many; but this is surpassed by the splendour of the insect
creation. As we brushed past a thicket of shrubs in blossom, a
cloud of butterflies and beetles on the wing would dazzle in the
sunbeams like a shower of gems, and then settle on the honied
sweets of flowers scarcely less brilliant in hue. Every
where&mdash;around, above, and below&mdash;were objects to feast
the sense of sight upon.</p>

<p>After a two hours' smart ride we entered a quiet glade, through
which ran a small clear brook. As we stopped to allow our horse to
moisten his lips, and take a draught of the cooling beverage
ourselves, we heard in the distance the tinkling of a sheep-bell.
Guided by the sound, we soon came on a flock of sheep quietly
feeding on the brow of a hill. At a short distance from them stood
the shepherd, tranquilly smoking his pipe, and attending to his
charge, as if there was no such thing as a gold-mine within many
thousand miles. As we approached him at a walking pace, we could
not but contemplate his peaceful occupation, so much in accordance
with the stillness of the Australian wilderness, and forming a
contrast to the turmoil and labours of the gold-diggers whom we had
just left. And yet an Australian shepherd is no gentle prim-clad
Lubin, as described in the old pastorals, sitting with his crook
and pipe, beguiling the fleeting hours by chanting some tuneful
lay; more frequently you find him a long-bearded bronze-featured
"crawler," as he is termed in the colony, clad in a blue serge
shirt, fastened round the waist by a broad leather belt, with
probably a pistol stuck into it; a musket over his shoulder instead
of a crook, and smoking a short black pipe in lieu of trilling the
musical reed.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry we found that this flock of sheep belonged to the
settler to whose station we were then proceeding; and the shepherd
himself was one of his oldest servants, who had remained with him
in spite of the great attractions of the diggings. He was a married
man, his wife acting as hut-keeper. He had charge of a large flock
of 3000 sheep which had formerly been two flocks, but his mate had
left and gone to the diggings. As an inducement for him to remain,
his master had doubled his wages, and he was then receiving fifty
pounds a year, besides rations for himself, his wife, and four
children. He was very civil; and in directing us towards the head
station, advised us to call at his hut, which was on the way, and
get a bit of damper and a pot of tea. This we were nothing loath to
do, as our breakfast off the gritty chops and damper at the
diggings had been sparing. Half an hour's jog-trot brought us to
the out-station, which was delightfully situated on the margin of a
brook. We were kindly received by the shepherd's wife, who was just
getting ready the mid-day meal; at her invitation we dismounted and
entered the hut. Here we found every thing snug and tidy, and the
cheerful faces of four happy children. As we partook of the
wholesome bush-fare of mutton, tea, and damper, with some smiling
potatoes and cabbage added, we could not help recurring again to
our comparison of the two occupations of the shepherd and the
gold-digger; and we decided once more in favour of the former. Of
course, we were biassed in the decision, because at the time we
were hungry. At the same time, good master emigrant, take our word
for it, if you are a married man, you will find pastoral employment
not only more congenial to your habits, but probably in the end
find the certain wages of the one more than equal the chances of
the other. And if you value social and domestic felicity, the
shepherd has always a quiet home for his wife and children, besides
an ample supply of house-comforts and necessaries; whereas the
gold-digger, with all his chances of fortune, finds a subsistence
precarious and uncomfortable, and the pleasures of the domestic
circle cannot be nurtured on the rugged mountain side, where his
labour lies.</p>

<p>After our meal was finished we took a stroll round this
out-station, to have some notion of the manner in which
sheep-farming is conducted in Australia. And as we afterwards found
that such a station was a type of all others throughout these
colonies, and the whole system of sheep-farming was merely a
multiplication of the same, we shall here note our observations for
the information of the reader.</p>

<p>An out-station is simply a hut built at a convenient distance
from the homestead, or from any other out-station on the "run" or
sheep-walk, so as to allow ample feeding-ground for two flocks of
sheep. A flock of sheep averages 1500 head; and three acres of
pasture-land are allowed to each sheep. An out-station, therefore,
commands 9000 acres more or less of pasture-land. To each flock
there is a shepherd, and to every two shepherds a hut-keeper, all
of whom find accommodation in the hut; while the sheep are yarded
every night in hurdle yards close to the hut; the entire
arrangement and conduct of the station being distinct within
itself, and having no connexion with any other out-station. The
business of the shepherd is to proceed with his flock every day,
Sundays not excepted, soon after sunrise, to the feeding-ground
pointed out to him by the overseer, with strict injunctions not to
encroach upon a neighbour's rim, or to pass the bounds of his
out-station; and to see that they feed at their leisure, and be
well spread over the ground while feeding.</p>

<p>By noon they travel in this manner a distance of four or five
miles, when they are brought to rest under the shade of some trees,
to shelter them as much as possible from the mid-day sun, which
they feel oppressive in consequence of their heavy fleeces. This
rest gives the shepherd an opportunity of eating his dinner, which
he carries with him, besides his pots to make tea in, the universal
beverage of the bushmen, A few minutes suffice to light a fire and
boil the water; tea is soon made, four or five chops are spitted on
cleft sticks and grilled before the fire, a piece of damper is
taken out of his wallet, and the shepherd has his fill of good bush
fare, mutton, damper, and tea. This finished, he winds up his
repast with a pipe of tobacco, by way of dessert. After an hour or
so has elapsed he resumes his task, rouses the sheep, and returns
to the hut by a different route, so that they may have fresh
pasture on their way back to the yards. He reaches the out-station
about sun-down, where he meets his fellow-shepherd returning with
his flock from an opposite direction. Each then drives his flock
into a separate yard, formed by hurdles; and if they are careful
men, they count the sheep as they go in, to see if any are missing,
for which they are responsible. The labours of the day are now over
for the shepherd, and he sits down to a hearty supper, ready
prepared for him by the hut-keeper. This latter personage takes
charge of the sheep during the night, when he acts in the capacity
of watchman, to guard them from the attacks of the native dogs. For
this purpose he is armed with a musket, and sleeps in a movable
watch-box, which is carried about by hand-spokes, like a
sedan-chair, and placed close beside the sheep-yards. When the
morning sun peeps out, he awakes the shepherds, to whom he resigns
his charge for the day. He then lights the fire and makes breakfast
ready. After the shepherds depart he sweeps out the yards, if they
are fixed, or shifts the hurdles if they are movable. This over, he
puts on his meat to boil, and bakes the far-famed damper. By the
time the flocks return in the evening, he has every thing snug, and
supper ready for the shepherds, as he had the day before. This
routine at an out-station is continued daily without variation
during the year, until shearing time comes, when the flocks are
driven to the wool-shed; also when the rams are put to the flocks,
and at the lambing season, when the presence of the master or
superintendent is required, to see that the men perform their
duties faithfully.</p>

<p>From tins rough sketch of the management of an out-station we
can easily trace the ramifications of the entire system of
sheep-farming throughout Australia. A run or squatting station is
composed of a number of these out-stations surrounding the
homestead at distances of four or five miles from each other, where
it is good pasture-land; so that when you hear of a squatter being
possessed of twenty or thirty thousand sheep, you do not see them
all on his run at one spot, but in detached flocks, as we have
described. And it is the duty of the overseer, or of the squatter
himself, to visit these out-stations occasionally, and issue their
rations to them either every week or fortnight.</p>

<p>Suppose then, for the sake of illustration, that an out-station
possesses 3000 sheep, and that there are on an average three of
these on every run, giving 9000 sheep to each squatting station,
and that there are one hundred squatting stations in a district,
mustering 900,000 sheep, and that each colony has ten districts,
this will give us eighteen millions of sheep for the two provinces
of Victoria and New South Wales, which is near the total amount,
according to the last returns. For every 4000 sheep depastured on
crown lands, the settler pays a yearly squatting license of ten
pounds to the government.</p>

<p>After thanking the honest woman for her entertainment, we
mounted our horses, and pursued our journey towards the head
station, about eight miles distant. The track at some places was
rather indistinct, from the grass having grown over it, which made
us proceed cautiously, as we had no idea of losing ourselves in the
bush, or encountering unnecessary dangers from want of
prudence&mdash;a common circumstance with strangers on their first
travels through such solitary regions. In this manner, and from a
stubborn self-confidence, which ignorant men display, many have
lost their lives in the Australian wilderness. Fool-hardy people
often encounter dangers which the bravest would shrink from, simply
because they are ignorant of the consequences. At that time we
heard of many who undertook journeys to the diggings of several
hundred miles, who never had travelled ten miles beyond a township
before. And the wonder was, not that they encountered so many
privations, but that they ever reached their destinations. While
others, who were unaccustomed to the ordinary hardships of the
bush, wrote letters to their friends, which appeared in the public
prints at home, describing the dangers they encountered, and the
hardships they had to put up with, which any bush traveller would
have laughed at. In none of the Australian colonies are the
bush-tracks, or natural roads, so good as they are in Victoria. Had
it not possessed the extent of undulating prairie and open
forest-land which it does, with so few mountain-chains to obstruct
the progress of the settler, it would never have become so rapidly
peopled by a pastoral population as it has been, who, in the course
of ten years after its settlement, occupied all the available
pasture-land with their flocks and herds within its territory,
simply because they had good tracks through the country to the
ports of shipment for their wool and tallow.</p>

<p>As we approached the homestead we heard the lowing of kine, the
bleating of sheep, and the homely bark of the dogs, which thrilled
with a pleasing sensation through our wearied frame, while our good
horse pricked up his ears and sniffed the air, as if he was sure
there was a feed of corn at hand. Emerging from the forest, we came
suddenly upon the head-station, with its house and out-offices
built upon a small hill, at the foot of which was a running stream
about ten yards wide; this stream we forded over a pebbly bed, with
the horse up to his knees in water. A general whoop from all the
live creation about announced our approach. Among barking dogs,
crowing fowls, cackling geese, lowing cattle, and neighing horses,
we made our way up to the house, where we found the proprietor
standing at his open door, who cordially invited us to dismount and
step in, after perusing a note of introduction which we presented
to him from his agents in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Apologising for the absence of his ostler, who had gone to the
diggings, he led the way to a roughly-built but comfortable stable
in the rear of the premises, where, between us, we managed to put
up our tired horse snugly for the night. After this he showed us to
the strangers' bed-rooms, of which there were half-a-dozen in the
house, and left us to indulge in refreshing ablutions, which, under
the circumstances, was the most agreeable thing we could have. When
we had finished, we were shown into a comfortably furnished
parlour, where we were introduced to our host's wife, a lady-like
personage, and his family, consisting of four boys and two
interesting girls, all in their teens. Besides these, there were
two gentlemen from a neighbouring station, who had come a distance
of ten miles to drink tea with them. Altogether, a more homely,
pleasant-looking family party you would not find in the oldest
farm-house in England; and nowhere but in a gentleman-farmer's
homestead would you find the same elegancies and comforts with
which the room was furnished. Sofa, table, chairs, carpet,
pianoforte, curtains decorating a French window opening upon a
verandah,&mdash;every thing had the semblance of wealth and taste,
which you might expect in the cities, but certainly not in the bush
of Australia. Our host, although more than twelve years a tenant of
the bush, had not lost any of the polished manners of the
gentleman; and his children, brought up under the care of an
amiable and accomplished mother, presented that decorum and
obedience which betoken the well-bred family.</p>

<p>Those who have read of the barbarous state in which the American
squatter lives, from whom the appellation has been derived, as he
squats down upon a piece of land in the backwoods, without paying
fee or license,&mdash;are agreeably surprised when they witness the
superior condition of the Australian squatter. Nay, in comparing
these gentlemen with the sheep-farmers and graziers of the mother
country, to whom they are more nearly allied, we must give them the
preference in point of education and enterprise. This is not to be
wondered at, however, when we inquire into the matter, for we find
them composed principally of gentlemen who have retired from the
learned and aristocratic professions. Doctors, lawyers, clergymen,
military and naval officers, sons of wealthy merchants, who have
gone with their savings or loans from the exchange or
banking-houses, to invest in these colonial securities of sheep and
cattle, as producing the staple commodities of wool and tallow,
realising, with ordinary care and prudence, a safe and good
interest for the money employed, besides filling up their time by a
not unpleasing pursuit. Nine out of ten of these squatters are
therefore merely amateur wool-growers and graziers; men who never
bred a ewe or an ox in their lives before they set foot in
Australia. No doubt they have gleaned sufficient knowledge of
cattle-breeding and sheep-farming from books and other sources, to
pursue either occupation in these colonies, but very few of them
have been regularly bred to the business. The fact is, that a
knowledge of the management of live stock in Australia is so easily
acquired, that any educated man possessed of common shrewdness may
be qualified in the course of twelve months to superintend a sheep
or cattle station. So that if you are desirous of establishing
yourself as a squatter on the waste lands of Australia, it is of
greater importance that you should go into the market with a heavy
purse than with skill and experience.</p>

<p>Of course, the general topic of conversation was concerning this
wonderful gold discovery, and the probable effects it would have
upon the pastoral interest. Our host and his neighbours complained
of the high wages they were obliged to give, and the scarcity of
labour to carry on the general business of their stations. At the
same time, from being in the vicinity of the richest gold-field in
the colony, they obtained more than recompensed them for these
drawbacks, by the sale of their beef and mutton amongst the
diggers. And luckily for them that the dry season at the diggings
was the time of sheep-shearing throughout the colony, for they
found no difficulty in getting shearers, although at an advance of
one-half more wages than was given formerly. They were looking
forward also to an extensive immigration from the mother country,
to neutralise the effects of the absorption of so much labour.
Meantime all were reducing their flocks and herds, by sending their
surplus stock to the boiling-down pots.</p>

<p>Our conversation was interrupted by the appearance of tea, or
rather supper; for although it is served up at six o'clock, it is
the third and last meal of the day, and like the other two, there
is always animal food served with it. Late suppers are scarcely
ever indulged in, not even in the towns. Excepting the dish of hot
savoury mutton-chops, the tea-table of our hostess was perfectly
orthodox. In the way of cups and saucers it displayed the newest
pattern. It is only at the rudest stations in the far interior that
tin is used instead of crockery. Upon our expressing our surprise
at the comforts and elegancies which surrounded our host, he said
his was but a humble mansion compared to many others in the bush,
especially in the older colony of New South Wales; and whatever
merit it possessed on the score of comfort and elegance was
attributable to his amiable partner, who was the presiding genius
over the homestead; for his duties took him away to the rougher
occupations of the station.</p>

<p>"A sorry place indeed would it have been but for her," was his
warm ejaculation as she left the room. "When we first settled down
upon this spot it was a rough life for the hardiest man to
encounter, yet she was not deterred from facing it, even with a
young family around her, although she never had experienced what is
called country life before. The cheerful countenance with which she
toiled through the drudgery of domestic occupations, was what often
spurred me on to greater exertion, that I might be able to build a
better covering for her and my children than a bark gunya. To us
bushmen these are the ministering angels to all our comforts; and
you will agree with me when you visit a station where they are not.
To a bachelor a bush life is a solitary life at the best; and his
mental culture does not improve in the way of refinement during a
long absence from the society of his equals, as the case must
necessarily be in our thinly-peopled wilderness; while the presence
of a wife and family, so far away from the busy haunts of man,
throws a halo of domestic comfort and felicity around the bushman's
dwelling, which no other pleasure can supply."</p>

<p>These remarks, of course, led the theme of our conversation away
entirely from the recent subject of gold, which engrossed so much
of the public mind wherever we went; and it was a relief to hear an
intelligent colonist like our entertainer revert to that pursuit
which had raised these Australian colonies to their high position
among the British dependencies. And as we were anxious to gain
information regarding the commencement and progress of this
lucrative pursuit, we took advantage of the open and candid manner
in which this gentleman spoke, to elicit the following
experiences.</p>

<p>"Eleven years ago," he said, "I commenced the business of an
Australian squatter, with four thousand sheep, for which I gave
4000<i>l</i>., including the right of the run, and a few horses and
bullocks, with a dray. This season I shall shear 30,000 sheep, and
I have a thousand head of cattle, and a hundred horses, besides the
improvements on the stations, as the reward of my exertions, and
the natural increase of stock since that time. And if all things go
well this year, I shall realise from twelve to fifteen hundred
pounds clear profit from my wool and tallow. So much for the
result; the manner I set to work at the beginning was to reside for
a twelvemonth prior to my purchasing stock upon a station, where I
gave my services free, to obtain a practical knowledge of the
details of every employment necessary on a sheep-farm, by acting in
the capacity of hut-keeper, shepherd, shearer, and overseer."</p>

<p>"In England I had been educated in, and practised the legal
profession, and I never supposed that I should have taken so kindly
to this rude occupation; but I am thankful now that I threw up the
quill and the desk for the sheep-shears and the wool-press, for the
life of a squatter has made a better man of me, both in mind and
body. Instead of being a pale and slender ghost, flitting about the
dingy courts of law, earning nothing more than a living for myself
and family, here I am, as you see, a stout able-bodied man, browned
by the genial exposure to our glorious climate, and able to ride
round my run, a distance of fifty miles, in six hours, while I am
monarch of all I survey. You see there is not much mystery in this
business here; nor is there a long period of apprenticeship
required to become a proficient in the craft.</p>

<p>"After acquiring a general knowledge of sheep and cattle in the
manner I have just related, you continue a careful supervision of
your flocks, and the salubrity of the climate will do all the rest;
for it <i>is</i> the prime agent in producing a fine growth of
wool, as well as giving a large increase to your flocks. Without
much care at the time of lambing, beyond ordinary watchfulness on
the part of the shepherd, we obtain a hundred per cent of sheep
annually, and grumble if it is between eighty and ninety. So rapid
has been the increase throughout this group of colonies, that the
hundred thousand ewes which depastured on the lands of New South
Wales in 1820 have increased to upwards of twenty millions. From
these circumstances you will suppose that there is a material
difference between sheep-farming on our Australian prairies, and
the same occupation on the English downs and Welsh and Scottish
bills, where so much loss occurs from disease and rigorous climate.
The precautions adopted by the shepherds on those bleak lands, to
preserve the health and increase of their flocks and herds, are not
necessary with us; neither do we require the long schooling and
practical experience which the English sheep-farmers or graziers
find it essential to learn, to be proficient in their business. By
them we are considered extremely careless and negligent of our
stock; which we do not deny, not only on account of the dearth of
labour amongst us, but the comparatively trifling loss it is to us
when a sheep dies, worth at the most four or five shillings, while
with them it would be forty or fifty.</p>

<p>"Seeing, therefore, that money and not professional experience
is the grand <i>desideratum</i> in following the business of a
squatter, we cannot promise adequate remuneration to men whose
knowledge and skill have been expensively or laboriously acquired.
We cannot, however anomalous it may appear, recommend this
essentially pastoral country to the practical and skilful man,
unless he has plenty of means to invest in stock. Some of my
brother-squatters go so far as to say that the practised shepherd
and his master have to unlearn their old system before they can
successfully follow the new. But this I do not admit; for I have
always found emigrant herdsmen or shepherds up to their business at
once, with the commendable quality of great carefulness towards
their charge, which inexperienced men do not possess; while we have
to thank our master-stockholders who have been sheep-farmers or
graziers before for maintaining and improving the fine and pure
breeds of sheep and cattle throughout the colony.</p>

<p>"From these remarks, my advice is more applicable to those
gentlemen squatters in prospective, who have the necessary means to
commence this lucrative pursuit. Less than 1500<i>l</i>., as a
foundation, will render their progress uphill work. Before
purchasing either stock or station, I would recommend twelve
months' colonial experience, should they intend to conduct
operations personally on the farm. If, however, they delegate the
management of their station to a superintendent, in whom they must
have full confidence, then a few months' residence in the bush will
be sufficient to initiate them into the life and business of the
country. To those who are of young and sanguine temperaments, there
is here a pleasing and delightful life before them; with a prospect
of realising an independency by attention and industry. So free and
self-dependent are its contingencies, that a species of romance
seems to clothe the occupations of the bush. Such feelings,
however, soon pass away before the stern realities of a squatter's
life during the lambing and shearing seasons, the delinquencies of
servants, and low returns from wool-sales. Then follows the
monotony of inspecting the out-stations, which fills up the
remainder of the year; and frequently the settler wishes himself
back into the bustle of a town."</p>

<p>Here our host was interrupted by one of the other two gentlemen
visitors, who possessed a cattle-station; and as he was a younger
man, he spoke in more glowing terms of a bush life.</p>

<p>"Although monotonous at times," he said, "yet still there is a
pleasure unspeakable to the man of mental vigour, in the healthful
exhilaration experienced by riding through the silent forests, and
over the smiling flowery plains, in the exercise of his bush
duties, which not only reconciles him to his lot, but leads him to
prefer it to a town life; especially if his sphere of action is on
a cattle-station, where every thing is fraught with excitement,
from the first occupation of the run to the branding of the
increase annually. And if he is a lover of horse-flesh, with its
attendant amusements, he will find no want of opportunities for
gratifying his inclinations in this respect, at the same time
rendering useful service.</p>

<p>"I will guarantee him as good sport in dingo-hunting as he would
find in fox-hunting&mdash;in cattle-driving as much excitement as
in following the hounds. In fine, to be the squatter <i>par
excellence</i>, a man must be possessed of indomitable
perseverance, with a good store of moral courage, and be to some
extent a disciplinarian, so as to keep his men in check, and
enforce order and regularity throughout his run; for it is upon
these matters, and not by engrossing his time with calculations of
profit and loss amongst his herds and flocks, that the successful
management of a station depends.</p>

<p>"Taking all things into consideration, therefore, and
notwithstanding the present temporary distress amongst us for want
of labour, we can safely agree in stating, that as long as grass
grows upon our undulating forest-lands, furnishing food for our
beeves and flocks, so long will capital invested in our living
streams of beef and mutton yield a steady and remunerating
profit."</p>

<p>In such instructive and agreeable conversation did we pass the
evening until it was time to retire, and our host persuaded his two
friends to remain until the morning. "Early to bed, and early to
rise," is the bush-man's maxim: and the rest of the adage follows,
according to our squatter friend's account.</p>

<p>Next morning we were up early, and joined our host in a ride
before breakfast round the outskirts of his homestead. We were much
surprised at the extent of ground he had fenced in for pasturing
his horses and milch cows, which he informed us would not feed
where sheep had been. The number of small huts clustered about the
place also gave it much the appearance of a little country
village,&mdash;which in fact it had been before the diggings began,
but now most of the cottages were empty. Within the precincts of
his house and out-offices was a complete farm, with all its
appurtenances. He grew as much wheat in his paddocks as supplied
the station with flour, which was ground by hand in large steel
mills. He reared an abundance of poultry upon maize, besides having
sufficient for his horses and pigs. He cured hams and bacon, and
made cheese and butter. In making the latter he had a commodious
underground dairy to facilitate the operation of churning in the
summer. Then he had a garden, where he grew fruit of many kinds,
grapes, peaches, oranges, apples and pears, besides kitchen-garden
stuffs, from a potato to a pumpkin. There was scarcely an article
of dairy or farm produce but was raised on this spot, where twelve
years before the poor starved aborigines could scarcely find a few
roots of <i>murnong</i>.</p>

<p>In fact, this enterprising settler was independent of supplies
for the subsistence of his people, if they would have done without
the foreign articles of tea and sugar. A peep into his store, where
these and other luxuries and comforts were kept, was not the least
interesting sight upon this little colony. Here was a regular shop
in the middle of the bush, as tidily arranged, with its counter and
scales, as any in the towns. Articles of every description were to
be had within, from a tarpaulin to a lady's muslin dress, from a
watch-guard to a bullock-chain.</p>

<p>After breakfast we all walked down to the washing-pool and
wool-shed, to witness the operations of sheep-washing and
sheep-shearing. It was a pleasant spot he had selected for the
former; A stream had been dammed up where some shea-oak and flooded
gum-trees lent their grateful shade from the powerful sunbeams.
Across this pool half a dozen men stood up to their waists in the
water, plunging the frightened sheep overhead, and sousing their
fleeces until they became as white as snow, a gentle current
carrying off the dirty water. In this manner they passed each
animal from one to another until they crossed the pool, where they
were landed upon a clean grassy paddock. Here they remained until
the fleece dried, and the yolk or natural oil of the wool began to
rise, after which they were considered to be ready for
shearing.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the washing-pool, situated upon the
brow of a hill, stood the wool-shed, where the sheep are shorn. It
was a large and commodious building of sawn timber, and capable of
accommodating 1500 sheep at a time. There were innumerable
compartments and pens for separating the sheep before and after
shearing; with tables and smooth floors for laying out the fleeces,
and a powerful screw-press for packing the wool into bales. As we
entered this spacious building we were much gratified at the scene
before us. The bustle and excitement of the men and sheep, the
shouts of the one and the struggles of the other, rendered it a
most unusual scene on the generally quiet routine of a
sheep-station. Here were the helpless animals possessed of their
thick fleecy coverings, dragged along by the legs to a platform,
where the shearer knelt down, and in the course of a few minutes
deprived them of their coats with his formidable-looking shears, as
easily as a man would undo his outer garment. And then the
naked-looking sheep, piteously bleating, were started to their feet
and driven into another pen, as unlike themselves as a dandy would
be when stripped to the buff. The fleeces were then rolled up and
put into a wool-pack within a strong iron-bound box, and subjected
to great pressure under the screw-press. After this the packs were
taken out and sewn up, each containing on an average 250 pounds
weight of wool, and then branded with the initials of the
proprietor, besides the quantity and quality of each bale. They
were then rolled into the wool-store ready to be taken by the
bullock-drays to the ship. And it was a satisfactory sight to our
enterprising host to witness the goodly array of bales heaped up in
that part of the wool-shed, considering the difficulty of obtaining
extra hands for shearing.</p>

<p>We reluctantly took our departure from the station of this
hospitable squatter; but as we had resolved on accompanying his two
neighbours, to have a peep at their cattle-station on our way back
to Melbourne, we thought it most advisable to proceed with them
that day on their return. As we lingered over the last glimpse of
that pleasant spot, and watched the blue curling smoke fade amongst
the trees, we could not imagine it to have been so recently
settled. An air of occupation floated around that human oasis in
the wilderness, which seemed to stamp its existence from all time.
The primitive character of many things about it also seemed to link
it with the past; a remnant, as it were, remaining of the
patriarchs of old, who tended their flocks on Judea's plains: the
rude bullock-yoke, and the unleavened bread, appeared vestiges of
that by-gone time. We could scarcely suppose it to be connected
with the civilised, the railway, the electric-telegraph world of
the present age. And yet part of those fleecy treasures we had just
seen shorn from the Australian sheep's back are probably now
flaunting through the streets of some gay metropolis.</p>

CATTLE-STATION.</h2>

<p>The two gentlemen with whom we were now travelling were the very
<i>beau ideal</i> of the Australian squatter. They were both
muscular men, about six feet high, between thirty and thirty-five
years of age, with clear healthy complexions embrowned by exposure
to the sun and air. They were dressed in strong shooting-jackets,
their trousers were lined outside with leather, and fastened round
the waist with a belt; each had a cabbage-tree hat on, and wielded
a stockwhip in his right hand. Altogether, as they sat upon their
high-mettled chargers, they exhibited in their persons much manly
grace, and showed in their countenances evidence of the salubrity
of the climate.</p>

<p>During the whole of our travels through this province of
Victoria we were particularly struck with the smart and robust
appearance of the men. And as they constitute more than two-thirds
of the adult population of the colony, we shall here note a few
remarks for the special information of our fair countrywomen who
are inclined to take a trip to the antipodes. Although the motley
population at the diggings, and the shepherds, stockmen,
bullock-drivers, and other members of the tribe of bushmen whom you
encounter in the interior, present a rough and somewhat uncouth
aspect, yet they exhibit more manliness of deportment than you will
find amongst the peasantry of the most favoured localities in Great
Britain or Ireland. We seldom observed that loutishness which so
strongly marks the English labourer, or that sullenness which
stamps the Scottish farm-servant, and certainly none of that
whining servility which often disgraces the manners of the "finest
pisantry in the world."</p>

<p>Again, we saw scarcely any lame or deformed men in the colony,
while their average stature appeared to be about that of our
regiments of the line. At public meetings, at the diggings and
elsewhere, which we attended, when there were many thousands
assembled, we can safely state, that we saw more above this average
than below it. And whatever objection we, as a nation of "shavers,"
can have to the growth of the beard and moustache, in our
estimation, it adds greatly to the manly appearance of the
Australian bushman. In the towns, however, all this is on the
square; and there is no difference between the exterior of a
Melbourne merchant, shopkeeper, or mechanic, and their prototypes
in the old country, excepting that they are more frequently dressed
in light clothing, and occasionally substitute a palm-leaf or straw
hat for the black "chimney-pot."</p>

<p>Our remarks, however, are more immediately applicable to the
gentlemen-squatters of the colony. And as it happened on our return
to Melbourne that it was the season of the year when they pay their
annual visits to the city for the purpose of closing accounts with
the storekeepers, we had the very best opportunities of seeing them
together. In the streets, at the hotels, and on one occasion where
nine-tenths of those in town were present, namely, the squatters'
annual ball, our observations led us to conclude that there were
fewer under five feet nine than above six feet. Generally speaking,
they are well-proportioned men, seldom showing any appearance of
paunch, or inclination to obesity; vigorous and active while
walking, with an upright carriage. They look like men who can stand
fatigue, and every one seems perfectly at his ease on horseback.
Although rough-riders, yet many show a good seat; and you may
frequently detect the training of the riding-school among them.
Altogether, there are few communities in the mother-country where
her sons can muster so much manly beauty as in the fair province of
Victoria. Think of that, ye maidens, who pine away in single
wretchedness, the ripeness of your youthful charms, from no other
cause than the obvious one, that your rightful mates have left
their native shores for the more sunny and prosperous antipodes;
while they in turn sigh for your presence, when fortune has smiled
upon their exertions. Meet the disparity of sexes there by
following in their footsteps, despite the ill-natured remarks of
your old-maiden sisters.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of our fellow-travellers, who knew every hill
and valley as familiarly as a cockney knows the streets and
buildings in the city of London, we made across the country away
from all beaten tracks. Now skirting some open plain, anon riding
along broken ridges, and down again by the margin of streams, where
the yellow tassels of the wattle-trees sent forth their delicious
fragrance. To the lover of nature in her pristine beauty there is a
charm unspeakable in traversing these solitudes, especially if the
mind has been schooled in the study of the physical sciences; for
in this region you are surrounded by a Flora and Fauna unsurpassed
in novelty and beauty by any other spot in the world; and we have
but to point to the late discoveries of universal wealth to show
the interesting field presented to the geologist in its unexplored
mountain-chains. Although the experienced bushman is seldom
conversant with the scientific details of those studies in natural
history, yet few men possess a more practical knowledge of physical
geography than they do. It comes intuitive to some men; and it is
surprising to see with what facility they will thread their way
through what appears to be a perfect labyrinth of hills and trees,
for miles and miles, arriving at their destination with the
greatest accuracy.</p>

<p>Although habitations are few and far between in these
thinly-peopled regions, still you are now and then reminded of its
occupation by civilised men from meeting in your journey herds and
flocks of those gregarious animals which form the wealth of a
pastoral country. We had not left the well-cropped pastures of the
sheep-farmer above a mile or so behind, when we entered the
cattle-run of his neighbours, our companions. Here the grass was
more luxuriant than on the run we had left. In many places, where
the cattle had not been grazing, it was up to our saddle-girths.
Although it looked dry and brown, we were told that it had lost
none of its fattening qualities; and frequently the poorer settlers
mowed it down, and obtained a good price for it as bush hay. It is
a fact worth recording, that all the Australian grasses are
peculiarly adapted to the aridity of the climate; not one of which
are indigenous in Europe. And although the European grasses succeed
in the humid climate of New Zealand, they cannot survive the summer
in Australia, nor take root upon its dry soil. This may be
accounted for by the former possessing a pith, like a rush, in the
stem, which probably retains the nourishing properties of the plant
during the heat of summer; while the latter, being hollow-stemmed,
shrivel up with the scorching heat.</p>

<p>As we descended by a rocky path upon an extensive flat,
surrounded by trees, we roused a noble herd of cattle from their
feeding. The sight was animating in the extreme, compared with the
usual monotony of the bush. The startled animals bounded and
gambolled about with all the activity and wildness presented by a
herd of bisons in the American prairies; while their homely brown
and white colours transformed the scene into an English meadow.
This was a mixed herd of cattle, or as the squatters call them, a
"mob" of two hundred head, which had been bred upon this particular
part of the run. And as a sheep-station is composed of a series of
out-stations, with separate flocks, so a cattle-station comprises
within its bounds several distinct feeding-grounds, where the
cattle are bred. From a strong natural instinct, they never travel
beyond this boundary of themselves; and if a herd is sold, it is a
difficult matter to keep them away from it. Neither do they require
that constant attendance which the shepherds have to pay to their
flocks; hence there are not so many men required on a
cattle-station as upon a sheep-station. Consequently, in these
gold-digging times, when labour is so scarce, the grazier-squatters
suffer much less than their sheep-farming brethren. One mounted
herdsman, or stockman as he is termed in the colony, is sufficient
to look after a thousand head of cattle; and it is a good sized
station which can muster five thousand head.</p>

<p>From this "mob" our friends selected a fat bullock, to be driven
to the shambles at the homestead. And as it was not an easy matter
to draught him singly from the herd, they were obliged to drive two
cows along with him. To effect this cleverly, they made a dash in
amongst them where he was standing, cracking their long lasso-like
stockwhips round their heads and flanks, and shouting all the
while, until they set the whole herd in motion. Suddenly, and with
great expertness, they turned upon the devoted bullock and the two
cows, and checked their progress by a cut or two over their flanks
with the electrifying lash, when off they set in an opposite
direction towards the head station. We followed in the best manner
we could, and assisted in preventing them escaping back to the
herd. It was break-neck work, however; for they set off at a good
round pace, crashing through the brushwood and leaping over dead
trees, whither we had to follow like hunters at a steeple-chase,
every now and then expecting to be unseated by the overhanging
branches, or stunned by a blow from them. In this manner we made
our descent helter-skelter upon the homestead, driving the
condemned animal safely into the yard, and allowing the two cows to
return to the herd, which they soon did by starting straight back.
As it was near the close of day no time was lost in slaughtering
the ox, which was speedily accomplished by shooting him in the
forehead; and in half an hour afterwards he was skinned and hoisted
up to the gallows, where the meat was allowed to cool during the
night. So rapidly does decomposition commence in the summer season,
that most of the animal would have been lost if slaughtered in the
daytime, unless cut up and salted on the instant. Therefore, to
enjoy a piece of fresh beef, the settlers have to butcher over
night. So essential is it to have a knowledge of this rough
business in the bush, that almost every settler can kill and skin
an ox or sheep.</p>

<p>By the time this necessary operation had been gone through, it
was dark, so we had no time to survey the position of the
homestead. As we crossed a tolerably large garden in front of the
cottage, however, we could discern sufficient of that building to
see that it had some pretensions to architectural beauty. It was
built in the Swiss-cottage style, and looked more like a habitation
in the old country than any we had yet seen in the interior. This
impression was heightened as we crossed the spacious verandah in
front, and peeped through the latticed window. Inside we saw, by
the light of a candle, a large and airy apartment built of some
dark native wood. It was rough certainly in finish, with the
rafters and shingles visible, but then it was lofty, and these gave
it effect; while an ancient-looking chimney-piece and well-filled
bookcase, neatly carved, threw a character into the room which
reminded us of those studios represented by the old Flemish
artists.</p>

<p>The good cheer we afterwards partook of within kept up the
favourable impression we had of the house; and it required a great
stretch of imagination for us to consider these gentlemen to be
denizens of the wilds of Australia and this their habitation, when
we looked around on so many comforts, and quaffed a glass of
excellent native-grown wine after supper. At the same time we
brought to recollection the remarks of our friend the previous
night, when discussing the advantages of the married state to the
squatter. There was the absence of the fairy hand of woman about
the hut. Our entertainers were bachelors. Instead of seeing those
pleasing ornaments of her industry which decorate the humblest
domicile, there was a motley assemblage of spurs, whips, tobacco
and pipes upon the mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>The latter articles were brought into requisition in true
bushman style. This universal practice of smoking in Australia
gives a dash of the American character to the habits of the people.
Although you rarely find them chewing the weed, yet they smoke the
strongest Negrohead and Cavendish. Every man and boy in the bush
smokes. Morning, noon, and night, you are sure to find the bushman
with his pipe in his cheek after meals. He says, at breakfast it
helps him to swallow his damper; at dinner it assists the digestion
of the mutton; and at supper it acts as a soporific against the
astringent properties of the tea; besides sundry pipefuls he smokes
during the intervals, for which he has no other excuse than that it
fills up the time. Herein lies the great incentive; for we are
certain that it is undeniably the pleasantest mode of idling away
one's time that we know of in the bush. The complacency with which
a regular bushman sits down to cut his tobacco, rub it, fill his
pipe, and light it with a red ember from the wood-fire, and then
draw the long whiffs from his short pipe, is not surpassed by the
greatest smoke-loving people in the world,&mdash;not excepting the
Germans.</p>

<p>We spent all the next day at this hospitable station, and we
were much pleased with the complete arrangements on the premises
for conducting all dairy operations. Here was a large underground
dairy, which is indispensable for churning butter in the summer.
Fortunately for them, women were more useful in these matters than
men. Consequently they did not suffer so much as their neighbours
by the <i>male</i> exodus to the Mount; for they retained the wives
when the husbands left, and with them they managed to carry on the
business of the dairy. But they had had great difficulty in
drafting their annual increase of fat bullocks from the herds, from
which they derive the principal returns, in the shape of tallow and
hides, by sending them down to the boiling-pots at Melbourne.
Boiling-down was the order of the day amongst all the squatters.
The times were such, that if the labour-market was not replenished
by immigration, they would be forced to reduce their flocks and
herds within the compass of what they could attend to by their own
individual exertions, and the faithful few who remained with them.
In the event of matters coming to this state, the proprietors of
cattle-stations would suffer less than the sheep-farmers.</p>

<p>Although the process of boiling down sheep and cattle for the
sake of their tallow, hides, skins, and horns, is now carried on to
a great extent throughout these pastoral provinces, yet it is not
seven years since the colonists first adopted this method of
realising from their increase. When it was first proposed in 1845,
it came almost in the shape of a discovery; now there are upwards
of a hundred large boiling-down establishments in both these
colonies, many of them erected at an expense of several thousand
pounds; and the export of tallow now forms a considerable item in
the products of the country. The fact is, that the export value of
these commodities rules the market-price of both cattle and sheep
now, instead of the former prices obtained for them, when new
stations were being formed in this province and in South Australia.
The days are past when forty shillings a-piece would be given for
ewes, and ten pounds for breeding-cows. This temporary nominal
value gradually ceased, as the increase of stock occupied all the
available pasture-lands of the country; and the settlers found that
without feeding-ground to maintain their surplus stock, they were
only worth what they would fetch out of the boiling-down pots.
Hence, if they realise four or five shillings a-head for sheep, and
twenty shillings a-head for cattle by this process, they consider
these sums about their intrinsic value, which is now regulated by
the account-sales of the above produce in the London market.</p>

<p>Taking leave of our hospitable entertainers, we once more
vaulted into the saddle, and pursued our journey back to Melbourne.
After a long day's ride we came into the main road a little before
we reached the Moonee-Moonee ponds, having made a detour from the
Mount Alexander road of more than seventy miles. The country in
this vicinity is fine open land, with scarcely any trees upon it.
In all directions you see post and rail fences, and exceedingly
good arable land under cultivation. In many places the crops had
been got in; but the great part, although cut, was still standing
in the fields; and these were left to be housed as they could by
the women and children. If such was the case now in harvest-time,
who were to sow the next crop and till the ground? People began to
ask one another, Where will all this end? The answer was:
Immigration will put all right again. That, however, is to be
proved. In the meantime the industry of the country is suffering;
and the people were giving high prices for grain and flour to the
American and Van Diemen's Land traders. Those who were prudent
enough to follow the steady occupation of farming turned more gold
into their pockets than the average run of diggers; for all must
eat, whatever betide.</p>

<p>It is surprising to see the abundance of tillage-land upon the
alluvial flats of the streams in this province ready for the
plough, without much trouble or expense required in clearing. And
although there are not so many extensive farms under cultivation as
may be found in the elder colony, nor such high-class farming
pursued, still they grow as heavy crops on the virgin soil of the
country. The bush-farmers are not over particular in ploughing in
mathematically straight furrows, or having trim hedges to enclose
their fields. A brushwood or log-fence serves the purpose of a
hedge well enough; and frequently the furrows wind round the stump
of a tree without offending the eye. Utility before elegance is the
Australian ploughman's motto. The fact is, that the rich and deep
alluvial deposits selected for agricultural purposes from these
broad lands are so strongly impregnated with natural manure, that
they require little more than a mere scratching upon the surface
with the plough and harrow to yield a crop of some thirty or forty
bushels of wheat to the acre. Season after season the seed is
roughly thrown into the soil, without adding manure. Crop after
crop is reaped in this fashion, until the land is impoverished; and
then the bush-farmer seeks a new patch of ground. Of course this is
the rudest method of cultivation practised in the colony; and we
mention it to show the superior quality of the soil in Australia,
which has been questioned, rather than the general system of
culture adopted throughout the country. Of these others we shall
have occasion to speak when the recital of our travels leads us
into the neighbouring colony of New South Wales. The old
farm-steadings there, and the system of cultivation, will vie with
the best in England, not only for Average abundance of crop, but in
their trim enclosures, straight furrows, and farmer-like
appurtenances. Still, in these times, the bush-paddock has a
preference; for the expense of thorough clearing, and other
improvements, is so much greater, that it leaves a small margin for
profit. Farming on a large scale has not succeeded in Victoria. It
is the small operative farmer working on his own freehold, or
standing under a small rent or improving lease, who reaps the most
profitable crop, provided he can conduct the operations of the farm
with the labour of his family. And now is the time for such
families to house a truly golden harvest from their combined
exertions, if possessed of a small share of the needful to begin
with. The market for their produce is just at their doors on the
alluvial lands around Ballarat and Mount Alexander, where the
hungry gold-diggers with heavy purses are their customers.</p>

<p>Both our horses and ourselves were pretty considerably fagged by
the time we reached the outskirts of the town, which was in the
dusk of the evening. And as we stopped at a comfortable-looking
house of accommodation called the "Retreat Inn," we gladly put up
there for the night.</p>

<p>As you approach Melbourne from the interior, the extent of the
town is better seen than from the river, for you travel along open
hilly ground, which commands a comprehensive view of the city and
its environs. It is built for the most part in a small valley
running north and south, and sloping down to the river, with gentle
rising ground towards its eastern and western suburbs; consequently
the mass of buildings which form the centre of the town are
inconveniently situated on this low ground, which is flooded by the
rains in winter, and scoured by the dust in the summer. The town
itself was originally one mile long, and three quarters of a mile
in breadth, going back from the river; but the whole of this space
has been long since built upon, and it may be now said to cover
double that superficies, the extreme ends being carried over the
two eminences. On the outside of this is a reserve of considerable
extent, the trees on which have fortunately been preserved; beyond
this, again, the lands which were sold in small lots of twenty-five
acres have been divided and formed into streets, which are in fact
an extension of the city of Melbourne, having the reserve, a
beautiful park, in the centre.</p>

<p>The appearance of the town from the top of the gaol, the
signal-station, and other elevated spots, is most interesting, one
might say splendid; and the country and immediate vicinity when
green has a most charming appearance, though there is wanting what
many call the picturesque; and persons coming from Sydney,
accustomed to its matchless harbour and beautiful scenery, might be
tempted to make a comparison where none can be made, each having
advantages and beauties of its own. In the distance you see the
spacious estuary of Port Philip girding the horizon, and the
shipping in Hobson Bay peering over the low land between the river
and the beach. In the foreground the town lies at your feet for two
miles along the bank of the river; the streets intersecting each
other at right angles in the direction of the four points of the
compass. Collins-street, Bourke-street, and Elizabeth-street, are
fine, wide, airy streets, well paved and macadamised; between them,
however, there are narrow lanes, which neither add to the beauty of
the town nor the health of the inhabitants. Lanes in a modern city
like Melbourne ought to have been expunged from the plan; but we
presume that the surveyor who laid it out in 1837 little dreamt
what it would be in 1852. Two years after the first allotments were
sold, there were scarcely 500 inhabitants on the spot; in 1851,
before the gold discoveries, there were nearly 24,000; at this
present moment, from the influx of emigrants, there may be 50,000
people congregated in the city and suburbs.</p>

<p>The rapid progress of the place before the gold discoveries is a
proof of the richness of the country, of which its port is one of
the outlets.</p>

<p>"Prior to the discovery of her gold," according to the report of
the chairman of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, "the export
produce of Victoria was proportionately larger than that which any
other of our colonies has exhibited. For the year 1850, for
example, when the value of colonial produce exported was
1,042,000<i>l</i>., and the average population 70,000 souls, we
have an export at the rate of nearly 15<i>l</i>. per head, which
for every person in the colony gives a power for the introduction
of all kinds of necessaries that must effectually promote at once
the business of the colony and the resources of enjoyment to its
society."</p>

<p>What this average may be for the financial year of 1852-53, when
probably 15,000,000<i>l</i>. of gold may be thrown into the scale,
it is impossible to tell. The sober figures of statistics seem to
start from their propriety at the calculation.</p>

<p>The public buildings, such as the Court-house, the Gaol, the
Custom-house, the Mechanics' Institute, the several churches of
different denominations, the banking-houses, and many of the
merchants' warehouses and shops, private dwelling-houses and
hotels, are such as would not suffer from comparison with the
public or private buildings in any well-built town in England; and
we may safely say that business, in all its branches, is conducted
on an equally fair footing, perhaps more liberal than amongst the
generality of the mercantile communities in the mother-country. The
merchant will find there, and in the other towns of Australia,
always a profitable field at command for the employment of his
capital, whether by exporting produce or importing merchandise.
With the retail dealers, on the debit-side of his ledger, he may
transact a safe indent and agency business, or sell them goods upon
consignment, either at his own risk or that of the shipper. In the
former case he has seven and a half per cent on the amount, in the
latter only five, receiving payment in the usual way, by bills and
cash; and now that the auriferous <i>banks</i> in the interior have
been discovered, the country store-keepers will balance their
accounts with gold-dust. The squatters, however, are his best
customers; with them he transacts a legitimate business of barter
and commission; and herein the merchant must be possessed of
<i>bonâ-fide</i> capital, for the purpose of enabling him to grant
the squatter twelve months' running credit in money and goods to
carry on their stations, until they realise the means of payment
from their annual clip and increase. He furnishes them with
supplies of tea, sugar, and flour, and every luxury in eating and
drinking; besides slop-clothing, and other descriptions of
merchandise required for the use of the women and children, as well
as the men upon their stations: he is not supposed to keep all
those articles in his warehouse, nor to break packages for their
supply, but he sends the various orders to customers among the
shopkeepers, who execute them. In many instances he is the
settler's banker, and cashes all drafts for money from the station,
charging five per cent; as security for this outlay, he can obtain
a preferable lien upon the ensuing clip of wool, which is
registered in the Supreme Court of the colony. This staple
commodity, with the not less remunerative products of tallow,
hides, and horns, form's a valuable list of entries on the
credit-side of the squatter's account. This is the most profitable
account in the merchant's ledger; for it does not stop here. The
exportation of so much raw material to the mother-country is
productive of still further profit; and when he considers that
there are annually from these two colonies alone upwards of 200,000
tons of shipping employed in this traffic, he may form a rough
estimate of the business done in the ports of Sydney, Melbourne,
and Geelong. Thus the variety of an Australian merchant's dealings
requires a head well versed in the intricacies of export and import
trade, with a thorough knowledge of their financial
arrangements.</p>

<p>We put forward these particulars to be useful to the intending
merchant colonist, and we can vouch from experience of their
general correctness. In the same spirit we shall be excused by the
ordinary reader for giving a few observations on the position the
merchant should assume on establishing himself in any of the
Australian towns or cities. One indispensable advantage in his
commercial transactions with the English market is to have a
substantial connexion in London or Liverpool, so that <i>he</i> may
appear an importer of merchandise in the colony, and <i>they</i>
become sellers of produce in the home markets, each party thereby
obtaining a profit at first hand. And from the length of time
required in communicating between the two countries, the most
implicit confidence should be placed in the mercantile integrity of
each other. The shipper in England should not foist inferior
merchandise at high prices upon his consignee, if he expects a
quick return; neither is it honest for the colonial agent to
speculate with the funds realised from the sale of goods entrusted
to his mercantile honour&mdash;that bulwark of British
commerce,&mdash;a sin which has been flagrantly committed by some
of the oldest houses in the colonies, and which has drawn upon them
the just reprehension of all upright merchants. Under all
circumstances, therefore, it will be well for the trader not to
speculate beyond his <i>bonâ-fide</i> capital; for the colonists
are very suspicious of men of straw. Let him assume no higher
position, likewise, in the community than his means will justify;
for he who is unsuccessful in his speculations, and has to expose
his nakedness in the insolvent court, finds it more difficult to
resume business with white-washed garments in these communities
than he would in the mother-country. There the circle of commerce
being so much smaller, his transactions are better known to the
public, and the man is soon discovered who transacts business
wrongfully. His conduct is severely canvassed, and a brand is set
upon him. Many bold schemers have mingled in the mercantile affairs
of these colonies, hoping to reap a rich harvest from their
speculations; but they have invariably failed. Let him avoid also
companies and bubble-banks which promise large dividends, whether
he has funds of his own or entrusted to him for investment. The
commercial reputation of the Australian towns has suffered very
materially from such projects, when the directors and managers were
not men of probity. Moreover, they do not possess so many
advantages for the capitalist as those which lie open to individual
enterprise. We do not greatly recommend the opening of branch
establishments by extensive London or Liverpool houses, without
their having implicit confidence in their local partners or
managers. From some cause they do not appear to have succeeded; for
during the crisis of 1843 they were among the first to stop
payment, and in several instances brought down the parent
establishments along with them. Probably the circumstance of the
junior partners being too far removed from their elder compeers
rendered them more speculative in their transactions, and less
economical in their expenditure. The merchant, therefore, who is
desirous of entering heart and hand into the trade and prospects of
these colonies should proceed himself to the field of action, and
become personally known to his constituents.</p>

<p>In strolling through the streets of Melbourne, we were very much
pleased with the appearance of the shops, which more than any other
occupation in the colony retained its true English features. It was
a rare harvest for the proprietors of these shops; from the little
storekeeper to the extensive haberdasher, all were making
exorbitant profits out of the gold-diggers. The same system of
doing business is pursued by them as in England; the same puffing
advertisements and shop-decorating. The largest profits are
realised upon soft goods and fancy-wares, slop-clothing, and the
like; and when articles of wearing-apparel are scarce in the
market, the most extraordinary prices are obtained from the
diggers. We saw 2<i>l</i>. a pair given for stockmen's boots, which
ordinarily sold for 6<i>s</i>.; and as the shopkeeper sells every
thing for cash in this golden age, he makes no bad debts. Any one
who lives frugally under these circumstances cannot fail to do
well. One-half the economy and caution required to make both ends
meet in the overcrowded towns of the mother-country will lead to
independence in Australia. Many of the most thriving shopkeepers
there have prided themselves upon having landed in these colonies
with only a few pounds, or perhaps shillings in their pockets.</p>

<p>But the class of men who were gathering the richest harvest from
the gold-diggers were the innkeepers. The public-houses throughout
the city are an exact importation from the old country, and their
proprietors a similar stamp of men. The bar of a tap-house in
Melbourne is exactly like those in London; in fact, all the
appurtenances you see around have been imported from there. We
strolled into the tap-rooms of these houses occasionally to see the
kind of life carried on in them; and every where extravagance and
folly was the order of the day. Those men who had returned
well-laden with their gatherings at the golden mount could not
drink fast enough, nor consume sufficiently expensive liquors, to
ease them of their earnings. "Drink away, boys! Let's see it out!
There's plenty more to be had where this came from!" were the
expressions used as they tossed their money lavishly into the till
of the innkeeper. The consequence was, that ordinary accommodation
was not to be had at these places of entertainment without paying
the most exorbitant charges. Hence the newly-arrived people found
it hard upon their purses to live in the extravagant manner pursued
by the successful gold-diggers in the inns and hotels. The more
prudent among them lived in tents and bark-huts at the outskirts of
the town, partaking of nothing more expensive than good bush
fare&mdash;tea, damper, and mutton. We therefore counsel the
intending gold-hunter to be careful of his means at first, and to
make no attempt to go with the stream, until he has been lucky in
filling his belt with plenty of gold-dust. While on landing he sees
around him the most reckless extravagance and riot in the hotels
and other houses of accommodation, we caution him to avoid
squandering his means in their taps or parlours. It is a matter of
great importance, likewise, to maintain temperate habits where so
much drunkenness prevails. At the same time we are not the
advocates of entire abstinence from strong drinks; for such is the
effect of the climate upon the kind of water to be found there,
that it is rendered more wholesome by the addition of a little
spirit; and, indeed, is a safer beverage, under certain
circumstances, than tea. No! what we refer to are the many
temptations which surround the "thirsty soul" in that social
community to break all pledges. Rum is cheaper there than in
England, and money is ridiculously plentiful; while the
constitution is excited to the drinking point sooner amongst boon
companions in that warm climate. These influences tend to destroy
the equilibrium of the sober man, to say nothing of the confirmed
drunkard or dissolute youth.</p>

<p>The mass of people, therefore, whom we encountered in our
rambles through the streets and places frequented by the public,
were bodies of men who had come into town from time to time from
the diggings, either for pleasure, to purchase necessaries, or to
recruit their health; and many with a determination to keep to
steady work. The two former classes gave life to the town; many, as
we have seen, squandering their hard-earned wealth in the
pothouses; others purchasing largely, to the great advantage of the
tradespeople. Some few were prudent, and deposited their gains in
the banking-houses, or purchased pieces of land to build upon when
labour would become more plentiful. But the great mass showed every
disposition to continue hewers of wood and drawers of water; and
probably, after all their success, they would be in the end just
where they were at starting, excepting that they may be somewhat
less strong than they would have been, had they persevered in the
quiet industrious occupations which hitherto prevailed throughout
the colony. But it is vain to reason even with those men who are
upon the spot, and have experienced many of the privations
attending the pursuit. Every man, or the great mass, whether equal
to the labour or not, seemed to be determined to try his luck, and,
if fortunate, to enjoy himself.</p>

<p>While the labouring class of people rejoiced in the altered
state of the colony, those who were accustomed to depend upon the
labour of others for their prosperity and house-comforts in town
suffered materially from the change. Melbourne is no longer what it
was in this respect; and though it may be a place to amass money
in, yet, unless immigration effects a great change, it will be a
place where such a thing as comfort cannot very well exist,
according to general notions. A professional gentleman gave us the
following account of his position. They had been in family, prior
to the gold-discovery, eleven persons, including three
women-servants and one man-servant. The latter, who was his groom,
and two of the women, left him; so he was obliged to act in the
former capacity himself. However, as he found the annoyance and
loss of time spent in taking his horse to water some distance from
his house was greater than the pleasure he had in riding, he soon
disposed of him. Instead of attempting to hire other persons, it
was determined upon to manage, for the present, with the old cook
as well as they could. And as she was rather aged, and of portly
dimensions, they thought that she might be depended upon. The lady,
however, had her own ideas on the matter. She thought the time was
arrived to make her fortune, and she determined to go to the
diggings, to wash and cook for the men. In three weeks she
returned, having expended all her means, nearly blind from the
flies, and in a dreadful state of bodily health from exposure and
privation, to which she was quite unequal. After staying a while
with her old master until she was partly recruited, she determined
once more to proceed to the point of attraction, although she knew
that the diggers paid no attention to their linen. Her employers,
however, would not allow themselves to be made a convenience of; so
they informed her that they had been taught a lesson&mdash;namely,
that of being able to be their own servants; and rather than
undergo the annoyance of constantly changing, they had resolved for
the present to rely upon themselves. Though it was no pleasant
position to be in, yet as there was no help for it, they were
consoled with the fact, that their expenses of housekeeping had
greatly decreased, and that they were independent.</p>

<p>From this the fastidious man who has been brought up in luxury,
and expects to find servants to attend upon him, will gather, that
Australia, in its present social condition, is no place for him. We
have shown that, on landing in any of the principal towns, he will
find house-accommodation and boarding expensive and difficult to
obtain; and that at the gold-diggings every man is obliged to look
after his own personal comforts. There he will have no servants to
attend to his little wants,&mdash;no laundress to dress his natty
shirt-fronts,&mdash;no obliging cook to prepare his favourite meal.
We would therefore advise such gentlemen as have formed themselves
into companies for the purpose of proceeding to the gold-diggings,
to take a few lessons in cooking and washing before their
departure, these being two essential qualifications for the
independent Australian gold-digger. We do not say this to deter
such parties from trying their luck at the diggings; for in the end
it may make better men of them. All we entreat of them is, to be
careful how they judge of the social condition of a country, where
they are apt to be prejudiced, because they cannot obtain comforts
and luxuries according to their notions of living. We might have
growled at, and quarrelled with, such contingencies again and
again; but we put a good face upon the matter, and met these
apparent disagreeables cheerfully. And so far from dreading to
encounter them again, we may probably, in a short time hence, be
found baking a damper in the ashes of an Australian bush-fire.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the busy aspect of certain localities in the
city, where these gold-diggers congregated for business or
pleasure, there was an appearance of desertion at other places
which apparently had but lately been the scenes of busy operations.
These were indications of the golden monster threatening to swallow
up the pastoral lamb. For several miles round much of the country
is enclosed by excellent fences and under cultivation. Every where
you see farm-houses and country-mansions, showing the appearance of
comfort and plenty, the result of the labour of an industrious
people upon a grateful soil. But when you come to examine them,
their male occupants have fled, and all industry is put a stop to.
In the towns the mark of the golden hoof is equally apparent. Where
formerly private and public improvements had been going on, and the
shipping-port all activity, now you see buildings unfinished and
improvements at an end, and a deserted shipping lying in the
harbour.</p>

<p>One day we visited a small town, about two miles beyond the
eastern suburb of Collingwood, called Richmond. It is pleasantly
situated on some rising ground, close by a piece of flat
agricultural land adjoining the river. It contains about 100
houses, and when all the people were at home it could muster some
600 or 700 inhabitants. Here we called upon a family who had come
out in the ship with us, and who had not only domiciled themselves
in this short time after their arrival, but the father of the
family and his two sons had commenced business in the city; and
they had judiciously fixed upon this suburban town for their
residence, in preference to the bustling and dusty streets of
Melbourne. The family consisted of the parents, two sons, three
daughters, and an old and tried domestic whom they had brought with
them. Already in their snug little cottage there was an air of
comfort which was truly pleasing. And although we are no advocate
for families encumbering themselves with too much furniture on the
voyage, we could not but sympathise with Miss Bessy, who sat down
to her old piano and played us a tune, with an affection for the
instrument which was quite charming.</p>

<p>There is one public structure in Melbourne deserving of notice,
and that is the Prince's Bridge. This bridge is thrown over the
river about 500 yards above the dam, and is a great ornament to the
city. It is built of very hard stone of a most durable kind. The
span of its single arch is but a few feet less than the centre arch
of London Bridge, and the balustrade is very handsome. The causeway
to this arch, over the flat land on the opposite side of the river
to the town, is of a considerable length, having under it several
small arches to carry off the floods, which are sometimes very
heavy, making, as we were informed, a fair breach over the flat
land between the river and Hobson Bay. Below the bridge the river
is dammed up, in order to keep back the tide and secure to the
inhabitants a supply of fresh water.</p>

<p>Crossing over the bridge, you come to South Melbourne on the
map, although in reality there is nothing in the shape of buildings
to warrant this title to the land across the river, from the
circumstance that no buildings have been erected there, in
consequence of the inundations to which it is liable. These
inundations do not occur in the winter season, when the greatest
amount of rain falls in Victoria, but in the middle of summer; and
they are caused by the melting of the snow on the Australian Alps,
from whence the Yarra-Yarra derives its source. Much damage is
annually committed by the flood amongst the farms on the banks of
the river. In December 1842 the government submitted the allotments
of this section of Melbourne to public competition, which was duly
announced in the <i>Gazette</i> to take place <i>upon the
ground</i> on a certain day in that month. During the night
preceding that day the river rose and overflowed the bank, covering
the ground, which the surveyors had pegged out, many feet deep with
water. When the intending purchasers came down in the morning to
view the <i>land</i> announced for sale, they saw nothing from the
punt which ferried them across but <i>water</i>; and although they
considered water frontage a great desideratum in the value of land,
yet water <i>abovage</i>, if we may be pardoned the term, was
rather too much of a good thing for them. This, of course, stopped
the sale; so that excepting some half-acre allotments fenced in
upon the rising ground behind, this part of Melbourne has been
merely used as brickfields.</p>

<p>Proceeding from the bridge in a southerly direction, you come to
the beach mentioned upon our first arrival in Hobson Bay. There is
a pretty good road for a few hundred yards after you cross over the
causeway; but the remainder of the way is along an old forest
tracks at one place through a swamp, at another through drift-sand.
Near the town this tract of land is thinly covered with gum-trees;
but as you approach the beach, these give way to the bottle-brush,
and other shrubs and trees which grow on the sandy shores of
Australia. The beach itself, where boats land from the shipping in
Hobson Bay opposite, is a desolate-looking spot at the best,
notwithstanding the presence of two inns and a number of wooden
tenements. At the time we visited this place, and passed over the
flat land on the south side of the river, there were no tents
erected by the newly-arrived emigrants. Since then, we learn by the
latest accounts that many thousands are encamped there, who either
cannot obtain shelter in the town, or do not possess the means of
paying for accommodation. This has been always the case with
newly-arrived immigrants on the Australian shores. They <i>will</i>
huddle together like sheep upon the most convenient spot to their
last abode, and nearest the principal town, apparently afraid of
venturing further inland. We would advise these people to proceed
without delay to some of the smaller townships in the interior,
where they will have a better chance of commencing colonial life in
earnest, than looking bewildered upon the bustling throng of the
city.</p>

<p>We have observed that many immigrants, upon their arrival in
these colonies, more especially from the middle classes of society,
are too chary in entering upon any project, or applying for any
situation; they prefer waiting a little to look about them. Such
prudent caution is no doubt commendable; but as it is better to be
looking about and doing something at the same time, we would advise
such persons to pursue their avocations without delay, and accept
the first likely situation that offers, even although such
employment or speculation yields small profit for the first twelve
months. In mingling thus at the earliest opportunity in the
business of the colony, they are merely serving an apprenticeship
to colonial life&mdash;what is graphically termed becoming
"colonialised." We would strongly impress upon the mind of every
man and woman bent upon the voyage, the necessity of coming to a
prudent decision on the matter before leaving this country. After
maturely considering the propriety of the step they are taking,
husband and wife, brother and sister, ought to be of one mind; they
should then shake off all wavering, and pursue their way to the
land of their adoption cheerfully, or not at all. If they have any
lingering doubts as to the prudence of their act, they had better
give it in favour of the mother country, and remain behind; for
those who carry doubts with them will most assuredly find them
rankle in their mind there, and they will tend to suppress that
energy and cheerfulness which are almost essential features in the
character of the successful colonist in Australia. There he must
strip off his coat and put his "shoulder to the wheel" willingly,
and commence the "battle of life" on that field of action as if he
was just beginning the world anew. This done, we will guarantee
that he will sleep soundly over his determination, and rise
refreshed under its influence, his eye beaming with hope as he
looks towards the promised land. Every man, therefore, should have
a clear perception of what his intentions are upon arrival; to
trust entirely to circumstances is to lean upon a broken reed.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the beach for about a couple of miles from the
landing in a southerly direction, you come to St. Kilda, a pleasant
spot, with some agreeable residences on its rising ground, facing
the shipping in the bay. It is scarcely large enough to be
considered a township. Brighton, however, two miles further on, has
more pretensions to that title. Like its well-known progenitor in
England, it is the resort of the townspeople for the luxury of
bathing quarters. Here the wealthy inhabitants of Melbourne have a
pleasant retreat from the dust and heat of the city. The road to it
is not by the beach, as we have supposed the reader to understand,
but by a tolerably good road a considerable distance to the left of
it, through some very agreeable open forest-land. These suburban
residences inform the stranger who visits the Australian shores,
more than all the wonderful strides of the busy towns, of the quiet
yet firm manner in which the Anglo-Saxon race takes root in these
colonies; that there is in them a determination to rear up the
homely institutions of their fatherland, and to live and die on the
soil of their adopted country.</p>

gold inheritance for the British race.</p>

<p>The traveller proceeding from Melbourne to Geelong has the
choice of two routes: one by land along an uninteresting road; the
other by water, making a pleasant trip of it in a steamboat. The
distance by the road is fifty-four measured miles; by water, as the
steamboat makes the voyage, it is somewhat less. On reference to
the map, it will be seen that both routes skirt the north-west
shore of the great estuary of Port Philip, and make the
half-circuit of Corio Bay. There is not much traffic on the road,
and we are not aware that there is any public conveyance between
the two places. The road for the greater part of the way is over a
desolate-looking plain, destitute of trees and shrubs, and scantily
covered with grass; and like the land about Williamstown, there is
a great scarcity of water. At the Werribee River, about half-way,
and the Little River, within eighteen miles of Geelong, both of
which are dry watercourses for the greater part of the year, there
are two indifferent inns. From this very uninviting state of the
road, therefore, few people from Melbourne travel by land to
Geelong; and when the settlers from the Portland Bay district
require to visit the metropolis of Victoria, they ride to Geelong
on horseback, where they leave their horses, and proceed by
steamboat to the city.</p>

<p>One bright sunny morning we took our passage on board the
<i>Vesta</i> steamboat at Melbourne for Geelong. This vessel is a
small iron boat, having two engines, each of fifteen-horse power;
she was imported from England upwards of twelve years ago, and was
brought to the colony in pieces. We started from the Queen's Wharf
punctually at seven o'clock, and reached Geelong at half-past
twelve, making the voyage in five hours and a half, including a
stoppage at Williamstown of half an hour. This little vessel is
well commanded by Captain Wetheridge, and has every comfort and
convenience on board that the most fastidious passenger could wish
for, and would bear comparison with the best river-boats in the
United Kingdom. While proceeding down the river, we partook
heartily of a substantial breakfast on board, served up in the best
style and at a reasonable charge. As we looked around the
breakfast-table upon our fellow-passengers, we could not but
observe with what keen appetites they dispatched the savoury dishes
of pork-chops, grilled fowls, beefsteaks smothered in onions,
accompanied by hot potatoes, which composed this early meal; but
for the tea and coffee, we should have supposed it dinner instead
of breakfast. The quantity of animal food consumed in this country
is extraordinary; almost every one eats meat three times a day. In
the hottest weather too it seems to make no difference, where in
other countries the appetite refuses to attack animal food in the
summer; and yet no bad effects upon the general health of the
community from this cause have been perceived. It would appear as
if the invisible secretions of the body, which the dry warm
atmosphere of Australia absorbs so abundantly, require a large
amount of strong nourishing food to reproduce them and keep up the
system&mdash;not the attenuated frame of the aborigine, but that
portly figure which the Englishman loves to display.</p>

<p>After a delay of about half an hour, occupied in "coaling" at
the hulk in Hobson Bay, and landing and taking in passengers and
cargo at Williamstown, our smart little boat steamed at a brisk
rate round Point Drake, speedily leaving the lighthouse behind and
opening up the waters of Geelong harbour. To say that the day was
<i>bright</i> is using a feeble expression to convey to the reader
any idea of the brilliancy of an Australian summer morning; the sky
and water absolutely glittered in the sunbeams, and we enjoyed the
shade of the awning spread over the quarter-deck of the vessel
amazingly. As she paddled along within a few miles of the shore, on
our right hand we could see the poverty-stricken country through
which the road from Melbourne to Geelong traversed; for many miles
inland it appeared a barren plain without any vegetation on it; we
were, therefore, the more gratified when the fertile lands on the
opposite shore, or southern side of the harbour, became
sufficiently close for us to discern its verdant slopes. This tract
of agricultural land in the environs of Geelong is called Indented
Head, and possesses the richest alluvial soil in that vicinity.
Through the telescope we could see numerous farm-houses studding
the green cliffs of the bay all the way along as far as Point
Henry. This point divides the waters of Geelong Harbour and Corio
Bay; closing in upon it, we saw a great many large square-rigged
vessels lying at anchor. We were informed that the greater portion
of the wool raised in the province was shipped at this port, which
is a sufficient indication of the rich pastures in the country to
the westward.</p>

<p>Ships arriving in Port Philip harbour from England, bound for
Geelong, proceed no further than this anchorage, which is about ten
miles by water, and six miles by land, from the town. And, as we
have stated in our memorandum, upon arriving in Hobson Bay, with
regard to the conveyance of passengers and their luggage from the
ship to Melbourne, the same applies here; for they have to proceed
to Geelong, with their goods and chattels from the ship, at their
own risk and expense. The most convenient way to reach it is by
hiring a boat to put you on board the steamer from Melbourne. As we
passed along, the vessel stopped to pick up passengers in this way,
which added considerably to the company on board. And thus We
steamed merrily into Corio Bay, passing over a shoal which reaches
from Point Henry across the entrance to the bay, with not
sufficient water upon it for ships of large burden to sail over it.
There is no doubt, in the opinions of persons competent to judge on
the matter, that a sufficiently deep channel could be made through
this shoal with a good steam-dredging machine, so as to allow the
largest ships to enter; in which case the port of Gee-long would be
a more important one than that of Melbourne. The surveyors report
that there is no great obstacle to overcome in doing it, and even
in rendering it a permanent channel for the heaviest war-ships;
whereas it is doubtful whether the removal of the barrier at the
entrance to the Yarra would continue clear. The Yarra is a stream
liable to great floods, and its waters convey the sedimentary
matter which form these <i>deltas</i>, when the downward current
meets the opposing tide at its mouth. Corio Bay, on the contrary,
has no river or running stream flowing into its basin, and
therefore has no outset to meet the flowing tide. The shingle which
forms this bar being once removed, it is calculated that there are
no influences likely to deposit the same again. As the colony
advances, there is every likelihood, therefore, of this important
matter being accomplished sooner at Geelong than Melbourne; as it
would not only take less time, but much less expense to
execute.</p>

<p>Upon entering Corio Bay&mdash;the inner Geelong of Captain
Flinders&mdash;you are surprised and are charmed with the view
before you; and if you have been up the Mediterranean and seen the
bays there, you may have your memory thrown back upon some of those
localities which were so agreeable to you at the time, and of which
you are so strongly reminded by all around you. Before you is an
amphitheatre of green undulating cliffs, rising abruptly from the
almost circular basin of the bay, some sixty or eighty feet above
the smooth sandy beach. On your right, a few miles back from the
shore, over part of the sterile plain we have mentioned, rises the
thickly-wooded cone of Station Peak, to an altitude of eleven
hundred feet. This mountain, and the lesser granite hills which
surround it, called the Anaki-Youans, has been said to resemble
Mount Etna and its volcanic group of cones rising from the Bay of
Sicily. On your left hand, about the same distance back from the
southern side of the bay, the Barrabool hills present a contrast to
the densely-timbered flanks of their neighbours, from being as
clear of trees as any Welsh or Highland mountains. Altogether the
scenery of the country in the vicinity of this miniature bay, from
the cleared rising ground on and about Point Henry, covered with
rich verdure, round to the forest-land on the opposite shore, with
its dark-green foliage, seen between the clear blue sky above and
the darker tint of the water below, presents many subjects worthy
of the painter's art.</p>

<p>The channel through this shallow bay is from four to six fathoms
deep, and makes a half-circuit in its course round the northern and
western shores, crossing to the south side of the bay, where the
town of Geelong is situated. As you approach the town along this
channel by the steamboat, it lies right ahead of the vessel, and
presents a very picturesque effect as you near the landing, where
there is a very long jetty run out, at which small coasting-vessels
and steamboats land their passengers and cargoes. The appearance of
the town from the deck of the vessel is very pleasing at a
distance, where you can see the whole extent of this northern
section of it; and as there is no dirty smoke hovering over its
streets and buildings, to give them that dingy hue which blackens
the finest cities in the mother-country, they have a freshness and
sharpness about them that is very delightful to the eyes of the
new-comer. The houses cover a slope rising gently from the cliff
which surrounds the bay, and you see them carried over the eminence
which divides the town, upon which is built a pretty little church.
But as the vessel nears the wharf, a terrace of buildings which
covers the cliff in front hides the view entirely from your sight;
and as you proceed into the town, you ascend a steep bank all the
way. The most conspicuous building which greets you on your
entrance into this delightfully-situated town, is a pleasing
edifice to all travellers&mdash;a spacious stone-built hotel.
During our travels through these two colonies, we do not remember
having seen a more elegant, commodious, and comfortable house of
accommodation than this hotel at Geelong; it has as good a
coffee-room as could be desired, and not inferior to those of
first-class houses in England; you meet with great attention from
the servants, and every thing is remarkably clean. As we sat down
in one of the compartments with some refreshment before us, and the
<i>Geelong Advertiser</i> in our hand, reading the latest news from
the diggings, we could scarcely imagine that we were within a day's
journey of the far-famed Ballarat gold-field. What! a few weeks'
hard work there, and you fill your pockets full of gold, and in a
day or two you may be lodged like a prince in this comfortable
hotel to spend your earnings. The fact sounds more like a fable
than an every-day reality. Verily this is a wonderful country
discovered in a wonderful age!</p>

<p>Geelong&mdash;originally named Corio&mdash;is the second town of
importance in the province of Victoria. By the last census in 1851,
previous to the gold discoveries, it contained 8291 inhabitants
within the four wards of its police boundary; 4491 males, and 3800
females. What the proportion of the sexes may be now it is
difficult to say; that which has occurred elsewhere in the towns of
the colony since this all-absorbing discovery has taken place here;
and Geelong, when we visited it, was almost deprived of its male
adult population. The town is well laid out, and there are some as
good buildings in it as you will find in Melbourne, and the site is
infinitely more salubrious and picturesque; and should it outstrip
that city in its progress, which its citizens are sanguine of, it
possesses natural advantages for the future capital of this
<i>England of the Southern Hemisphere</i> which the present seat of
government can lay no claim to. While the latter is built in a
valley, most unfavourable for its sanitary condition, Geelong is
built upon an eminence, surrounded by an open country, with the bay
in front; admirably situated for drainage, and well supplied with
wholesome fresh water, which has already been brought to the
dwellings of the inhabitants in iron pipes. There is no comparison
between the two places as to which is best situated for the comfort
and health of a dense population.</p>

<p>Crossing from the bay over the rising ground already mentioned,
you descend about an equal distance on the other side, when you
come to South Geelong, situated on the Barwon River, a wide and
flowing stream about twice the breadth of the Yarra at Melbourne.
Although there is here a large proportion of the buildings which
form the town, still it has not made any thing like the progress
that the northern section has done: of course this is easily
accounted for, from the latter being contiguous to the shipping;
but the day may yet come when some enterprising company will render
the Barwon navigable from its entrance in Bass's Strait, and then
South Geelong will rival its sister. To see the course of this
stream in all its beauty, you have but to ascend the Barrabool
hills on the opposite side of the river, which you cross in a punt
sufficiently large to ferry over two drays and twenty oxen. The
soil on those hills is exceedingly rich, surpassing, it is said,
that of any other part of the colony; and unlike most hills and
mountains in this primitive region, they are clear of trees; the
farmer having nothing more to do than drive the plough into the
virgin soil, without clearing or other preparation. From this
circumstance there is an unobstructed view around them in all
directions; and the one to which we have alluded, viz. the view
eastward down the course of the Barwon, which is truly charming.
From Fisher's agricultural station on the brow of the eastern flank
of these lulls, some two or three hundred feet above the level of
the river, you see the Barwon winding its way through an open
verdant country, with scarcely a tree on its banks to hide its
glassy surface, and then spreading out in a wide sheet of water,
named Lake Connewarre, which suddenly contracts into the narrow
outlet of the river in Bass's Strait. Retracing your steps from
these hills back to South Geelong over the river, and approaching
North Geelong, you have a charming prospect from the rising ground
which divides the town. From this direction Corio Bay has the
aspect of a Cumberland lake, and Station Peak might be compared
with some of the famous mountains in that picturesque county; you
also see the streets and buildings in the town to better advantage
from this eminence. When the original plan of the town becomes
entirely built upon, the streets running north and south will have
a fine effect; at present, however, those which are most forward
are the streets running parallel with the bay in front.</p>

<p>To the westward of South Geelong there are some very pretty
suburban residences, and two rising villages a short distance out
of town. The latter, named Ashby and Irish-town, have a population
of many hundreds each, the inhabitants being principally employed
in dairy and agricultural farms. It is upon such localities that we
would recommend the new-comer to plant his seed, and obtain his
first stock of colonial experience. Families who may be
disappointed with the aspect of affairs upon their arrival at
Melbourne or Geelong, will find better opportunities of
establishing themselves upon a freehold with a small sum, and
forming a quiet home for themselves in the smaller towns of the
interior, than risking their time and means at these
expensive-living towns. The man of enterprise also should push on
as far as Warnambool, Belfast, or Portland, the flourishing seaport
towns in this district, surrounded by rich agricultural lands. On
referring to the map, the reader will find that the first of these,
Warnambool, is about 180 miles from Geelong upon the River Marria,
and forms a snug harbour for coasting vessels. It contains about
500 inhabitants; they transact a good business with the surrounding
settlers, who are mostly agriculturists; and as it is likely that
the threatened dearth of corn by the influx of so many immigrants
will raise the value of this article to famine prices, no doubt
that they will find it a surer way to gold-getting by cultivating
their fields than digging on the mountains. We anticipate
therefore, both here and at Belfast, twelve miles further west, the
return sooner of their inhabitants from the diggings than to the
larger towns already mentioned. The town of Belfast is the centre
of a considerable population among these thinly-peopled regions;
before the gold-discovery it contained within its police district
3846 inhabitants, 2365 males and 1481 females. Of course the
majority of the male adults left, as in other places; but there is
every likelihood that they will return, at all events during the
sowing and reaping seasons, to secure the <i>golden</i> harvest.
The town itself is a prettily situated place upon the shores of
Port Fairy&mdash;which is but an indifferent harbour, from being
exposed to the south-east winds, that blow very strong on this
coast. However, small vessels from the neighbouring island of Van
Diemen's Land, and other coasters, find it a tolerably safe
anchorage when these winds do not set in, which is more than eight
months in the year. There are between three and four hundred houses
in the town, and four places of worship belonging to different
denominations; its population in 1851 was about 800. Further west,
about forty-five miles by the road, you come to Portland, the most
western township in the province of Victoria, and situated in the
bay of that name. This has always been a central outport for the
produce of the squatting districts around, and would have rivalled
Geelong before now if the harbour had been a safe one. Like Port
Fairy, however, Portland Bay is merely an open roadstead, where
ships lying at anchor have to slip their cables and run when the
south-east gales blow, and no boat can obtain a landing. These
gales, however, are not so frequent as to prevent a considerable
intercolonial trade to be carried on between this port and
Launceston, which has continued ever since the establishment of the
colony, when the success of both the town and district was mainly
attributed to the enterprise of our very worthy friends, the
Messrs. Henty. It contained within the bounds of its police
district, according to the last census in 1851, 2342 inhabitants,
1459 males and 883 females. There are about four hundred brick and
wooden houses in the town, several comfortable and commodious inns,
many large warehouses, six churches, and a gaol. It has a postal
communication overland with Melbourne once a week. Those who look
over the list of vessels bound for these colonies from London, will
have observed that there are occasionally one or two laid on for
this port.</p>

<p>Taking Geelong, therefore, as a key to the rich lands of
Australia, it is unrivalled in its resources, even by the finest
ports on the east coast; for besides the advantages we have already
enumerated, it possesses a gold-field little inferior to its
neighbours, always excepting the mammoth-yielding Mount. It is well
known that within this district gold was not only first discovered
after the hidden treasures of Ophir were revealed, but nearly two
years prior to the first discovery by Mr. Hargreaves gold was found
in the neighbourhood, not in mere scales, but in nuggets several
ounces in weight. Our time was limited, or we should have paid a
visit to the famous Ballarat diggings. And as our history and
description of these gold-fields would be incomplete without some
allusion to them, we shall here extract a most ingenuous statement
of the chances of gold-digging in that locality by a correspondent
of the <i>Melbourne Argus</i>, which we obtained in the colony,
from which the intending gold-seeker will glean much valuable
information, and the intelligent reader at once see the working of
a hundred and forty-three cradles, as if they lay before him in one
of these gold-valleys.</p>

<p class="newpaper">"<i>Buninyong</i>.&mdash;If Fortunatus had
thrown the contents of his cap over the lands of Ballarat, the
yield of riches would not have been increased. Here
surface-workings are abandoned, and the sub-strata are delved into
for riches, which repay a thousandfold the labour expended on them.
The yield is immense, and seemingly inexhaustible; the gold lies in
'pockets' in the blue slatey clay, and may be picked out with a
knife-point. So rich, indeed, is it, that many have abandoned
cradle-workings for tin dishes, which have yielded from two to
three ounces in one washing. Many will make fortunes, hundreds a
competency; and the vast majority will do well. Nature has spread
out a vast magazine of riches for the enterprise of Geelong to
stretch forth her hand and take it; and strong and earnestly have
her sons set about the pleasant task. I have been at much trouble
to compile a detailed table of the numbers of men on the ground,
the number of cradles, the yields, and the time occupied in
obtaining it; for I could not expect the public to believe such an
extraordinary statement as I am about to lay before them, if such
statement were not fortified by ample data. The wildest reports
which have been circulated fall far short of the reality; and I am
obliged to write truths that must appear to those far away as the
chimerical workings of a diseased brain, or the results of an
imagination unbridled by reason. I little thought when I first
started to Buninyong, that it would fall to my lot to chronicle
facts which, if embodied in romance, or made the elements of a
fairy tale, would have excited a smile of incredulity.<br>
<br>
"I subjoin a tabular statement, showing that on the Ballarat
gold-field 143 cradles and 567 men have produced, in the days
specified in the table, the enormous amount of 4010 ounces, or
12,030<i>l</i>. worth of gold, taking it at the present commercial
value of 3<i>l</i>. per ounce."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>During our stay at Geelong we met and conversed with many
gentlemen who had been to these Ballarat diggings, and who had
returned successful, not only as gold-diggers, but from having
followed those avocations which circumstances had created in this
new order of things, and which at the time were well remunerated by
the people at the diggings. In several instances our informants
were professional gentlemen, who had not so much left their usual
occupations, as their occupations had left them; consequently they
were obliged to join in the golden scramble to earn a living.
"Poverty," they say, "makes neighbours of us all." In this instance
the old adage was reversed, and the leveller of all distinctions in
the present case was wealth: the simple employment of gathering
gold from its natural bed made "Jack as good as his master." At
first the meanness of the labour, and the degraded mode of living
at the mines, made these parties hesitate in mingling with the
general mob; this feeling, however, soon wore off, as the
extraordinary reward for their exertions came into their pockets.
And as there continued to arrive at the point of attraction many
others who had moved in the same sphere of life with themselves,
and who were bent upon the all-absorbing business of gold-digging,
they not only became reconciled to the occupation, but it began to
assume in their eyes a degree of respectability which it did not
possess before. They saw before them merely a few years of hard
uncomfortable toil, to amass a sufficient quantity of the coveted
metal to ensure them an independence for life; and from the success
of some, their expectations were not likely to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Let us apply the case of these gentlemen to those in a similar
sphere of life in the mother country, and the result will be the
same; for what is all their toiling at some laborious profession,
but endeavouring to obtain a competency for the autumn of life?
Others, again, try to grasp it in the liver-burning,
brain-destroying regions of the Indies; while here, in the genial
clime and golden lands of Australia, a certainty awaits their
exertions, if judiciously and steadfastly applied to one pursuit.
To the man of firmness and prudence the reward is there before him.
The object is to be accomplished, if he have the means and
appliances to set about and continue his task; and these are health
and strength, with a small purse of the needful to start with. We
say it again&mdash;and we are no enthusiasts in the
matter&mdash;keep your eye fixed steadily upon the main chance, and
you will turn up a prize; the gold is to be won. You must never
flinch from the task, so long as it is honest, and you are able for
the occasion.</p>

<p>This is no idle talk for the present, nor even wild speculation
for the future; for we look upon these gold discoveries in
Australia as a great inheritance for the British race. Our own
personal conviction is backed by the Highest scientific authorities
in saying, that among the mountain-chains of that auriferous region
are treasures untold, to enrich generations yet to come. And if
gold retains any thing like its value throughout the nations of the
earth, either as a standard of currency or an article of
merchandise, here is the universal bank for the persevering and
industrious to draw upon. Your draft upon its treasures is by a
draught of water through the sparkling dust, and you sign your name
with the point of your pickaxe. And shall the educated classes fall
behind in the pursuit, because it appears degrading in the eyes of
the fastidious, or the contamination from others tends to
immorality? He must indeed be a weak-minded man who will suffer
from either; there is a greater likelihood of the mass becoming
improved if the better class amalgamate with them. These
considerations, as we have remarked, form not a question merely for
the moment, which a few years may alter, but they will apply for
all time, when our children and our children's children will be
making up their minds to push their fortunes at the Australian
gold-diggings.</p>

<p>As our stay was brief in this charming little town, we made as
much of our time as possible in discussing matters of this kind
with such of its intelligent inhabitants as we found at home. Then
taking farewell of them, we stepped on board the steamboat for
Melbourne, and prepared for our overland journey to Sydney.</p>

<p>To fireside travellers the map of a distant region like
Australia, situated under the heavens of a different hemisphere,
conveys but a very indifferent knowledge of its physical geography.
And even were we to attach the most elaborate explanatory notes to
the annexed map of the section of that vast country at present
before us, we should fail in presenting the reader with any thing
like a faithful sketch of its geological character, much less to
denote those atmospheric changes which influence vegetation within
such a range of latitude. We do not, therefore, presume to add any
thing to the geographical information given by those who have gone
over the ground before; all we shall endeavour to accomplish, in
describing our overland journey from Melbourne to Sydney, will be
to show the reader that there are vast tracts of land in the
interior of these colonies capable of maintaining dense
populations, and that Australia is not entirely that barren waste,
devoid of rivers, which ignorant or prejudiced writers have
maintained. In this emigrating age, useful facts in detail are more
desirable than elaborate general descriptions; and such it shall be
our province to present to the reader. Before entering upon the
particulars, however, of our overland journey from Melbourne to
Sydney, we may premise, that the general character of the country
and its inhabitants was much above the estimate we had previously
formed of Australia and the Australians in the far interior. For
example, we found generally good accommodation at the roadside
inns; although, in these days of gold and discomfort, at some
places we did experience some inconvenience; but such, we have no
hesitation in saying, will be found exceptional: and those persons
who have described the accommodation to be met with in travelling
through Australia as wretched, have, we will not say, stated that
which in their case was incorrect; but we may be permitted to say,
that they were very unfortunate in this respect. For ourselves, we
must observe, that for civility, cleanliness, and comfort, we were
pleased to find that, in general, our country-people gave full
promise of not falling off from that which has been said to be
peculiar to England, viz. the excellence of its roadside inns.</p>

<p>During our journey along the main roads of the two provinces, we
encountered a travelling population which equally surprised and
delighted us; the great traffic and bustle of people <i>en
route</i> to and from the various gold-fields was oftentimes a
stirring and animated sight: the men, women, and children on
horseback and on foot, in various descriptions of carriages, carts,
and drays, thronged the highways of the interior, independently of
mail-carts and other means of postal communication between the
various inland post-towns and the capitals of each colony, besides
the flocks and herds seen in every direction; so that the supposed
desolateness and solitariness of the interior does not exist to any
thing like the extent that it is supposed to do. You pass through
towns frequently where there are well-built stone, brick, and wood
houses, with the usual public buildings which constitute a
government township in Australia, occasionally having some
pretensions to beauty of architecture. In these towns, likewise,
you will find all the elements of what constitutes agreeable
society, as established in the most refined towns and cities in the
mother country. Occasionally, also, you meet with, in well-chosen
spots, the residences and homesteads of the squatters and other
settlers, who live away from the busy world, in some of which great
taste is displayed. As, for instance, at Cambamurro, the squatting
station of Mr. Manning, not far from the Murrumbidgee river; there
his amiable and accomplished lady proves what a charm there is in,
and how much there is imparted to society by the presence of a lady
in the wilds of the bush. And also at Mr. O'Brien's of
"Deuro"&mdash;the native name of his station&mdash;whose residence
is delightfully situated in the midst of land in the highest state
of cultivation, and extensive enclosures, on a rising ground above
the river Yass, such as any country gentleman in Britain would be
well satisfied with. At this spot also is another instance to add
to that we have alluded to, where the residence of a lady of
refinement in the interior spreads the beneficial influence of her
presence upon all around her.</p>

<p>Though there is much sameness in the scenery, and what some
would consider monotonous in the aspect of the country, from the
paucity of human habitations, still, as time rolls on, and they
spread over the wilderness, this will be less felt. And as you pass
for many miles frequently through fine open undulating forest-land,
and large tracts entirely without timber, presenting no obstruction
to the plough or harrow, you are impressed with the idea of a great
future for Australia and the Australians. And when the means and
appliances of this age of inventions are introduced to open up the
interior of this fruitful region, there are no bounds to the
success which these colonies will attain. Even at the present time,
if it were possible to obtain the labour necessary, by the
temporary sacrifice of feeling, to complete a railway to Wodenga, a
distance of about 200 miles from Melbourne, on the Sydney road,
seen on the map to be situated on the left bank of the Murray
River, and forming the northern boundary of the province, and to
accomplish which there does not appear to be any great obstacle,
the advantages to Melbourne and the intervening territory would be
very great. The riches and natural resources of the country are
incalculable; and these will never be fully developed until
population increases, and means are established to enable them to
spread over the country, by communication with the interior being
made cheap and easy. At present, in the rainy weather, the roads
are very bad; and the richer the soil, the roads seem to be in the
worse condition,&mdash;in fact, they become almost impassable; and
the carriage of supplies to the interior has reached the enormous
charge of 90<i>l</i>. per ton to Mount Alexander from Melbourne.
There is great danger also from the frequency of high and sudden
floods in the interior, which destroy the ordinary roads of the
country; so that the colonists should make every venture and
sacrifice to complete a work, upon the judicious execution of which
will depend in no slight measure their progress.</p>

<p>The distance from Melbourne to Sydney by the new line of road
marked out on the annexed map is 590 miles. You proceed into this
road through the northern suburb of the city; and for several miles
you find it enclosed by post-and-rail fences, and in some parts
macadamised. On either side there is much land under the plough,
with many neat cottages having gardens belonging to the poorer
class of settlers, and occasionally large farm-steadings and
private residences belonging to the wealthier colonists. The road
passes over a pleasing variety of hill and dale for the first forty
miles, reminding the traveller frequently of the old turnpike-roads
in the mother country. For a considerable part of the way you
proceed over extensive grassy plains and much land that has a
park-like appearance. Twenty-five miles on the road you come to a
very pretty roadside inn, with a verandah in front, called the
"Hunter's Best," which in times of quiet would have been to the
stranger not only a surprise at the presence of so much English
comfort having taken root in the bush, so different from what he
had pictured to himself, but also have given him a high opinion of
the civilised condition in which the colonists have hitherto lived
in the interior.</p>

<p>This picturesque and well-watered description of country extends
to the base of a range of hills, the road passing over what is
called the "Big Hill," which well deserves the name of mountain,
from the summit of which you have a magnificent view of the country
you have just traversed. The soil on the south side of the range is
remarkably good; upon it the indigenous grasses grow luxuriantly,
and the cattle we saw grazing thereon were in fine order. Higher
up, the eye rests pleasantly upon a homestead, the commencement of
civilisation in this romantic spot, and well chosen, being only a
short distance from the main road. Surmounting this hill, and
descending its northern slope on the opposite side, the land is
less fertile, and displays trees of a different character, such as
are found throughout the colony to indicate the presence of poor
land; these are stringy-bark, iron-bark, and such trees as split
well, and are used for making posts and rails, shingles, and
general building purposes in the bush. So far from this description
of land being disadvantageous to the settler, it becomes, under
certain circumstances, of greater value than the best
pasture-ground; for without timber of this kind he would be often
at a loss to erect substantial habitations, and make fences and
hurdles for his sheep and cattle-yards, which are so necessary
throughout all those colonies. As you get towards the foot of this
range of mountains the soil gradually improves, and you soon pass
over an undulating grassy tract of fine land; the country, however,
does not appear to be well watered until you descend into the
valley, where you come to the first rural township of any
importance; this is Kilmore, a considerable post-town in Victoria,
distant about forty miles from Melbourne, on the Sydney road.</p>

<p>As we descended into the valley we found it excessively hot and
oppressive; there seemed to be little shelter from the powerful
rays of the sun, and not much chance of a breeze sweeping through
it to cool the heated air. This, with the presence of our old
tormentors the flies, gave us an unfavourable impression of the
place, for as we passed along we met several people suffering very
much from their attacks. Most of the male inhabitants wore veils;
but we found that feminine screen disagreeably warm; so we stuck a
bough in front of our hat, which answered the purpose admirably, as
we have seen the countrymen in England do with their horses for the
like object. As these flies are such a positive nuisance in the
colony, we would suggest the formation of a company to be called
the "Fly-annihilating Association," trusting that it may attract
the considerate attention of some of those patriotic gentlemen who
favour the world with forming companies of every sort, nothing
daunted at times by the impossible. They may rest assured that
their efforts would be hailed with delight by all classes of
individuals in the Australian community, and we hope soon to see
the prospectus.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these disagreeables, we were pleased with the
township of Ealmore, as it is the first inland town of any
pretensions which you come to after leaving Melbourne on your
overland journey. As you approach it from the adjacent high land,
you see its position to advantage, and its tiny buildings lying out
before you in the broad valley below; on nearer inspection, you see
streets planned and pegged out by the surveyors; but there are many
gaps to fill up before these can be discernible to the eye of a
stranger. There are, however, several comfortable houses of
accommodation in the place, with a hearty welcome from their
landlords to the passing traveller; and we saw some commodious
stores, wherein, we were informed, a large amount of business had
been transacted until lately. In fact, before the gold-discovery
few inland towns in this province gave greater hopes of becoming
soon a place of considerable importance; since then its signs of
industrial advancement have been checked&mdash;all is silent where
formerly the bustle and noise of labour was heard. The great
majority of the men had gone away to the diggings, and those who
had sufficient strength of mind to keep at home were thinking and
speaking only of gold. We were told that the inhabitants
principally consisted of Irish emigrants. There were three bakers'
establishments in the township, but neither bread nor biscuit could
be purchased at either of them; all the men were gone. Instead of
supplying your wants, the solitary few who remained in this
deserted village were profuse in their inquiries, and anxious to
learn the last news from the diggings, and the future prospects of
the diggers. In truth, at every town along the road this new
discovery was the all-absorbing topic which filled the public mind;
it was the only talk you were entertained with, and the word which
was constantly uppermost in conversation was gold!</p>

<p>Again would the question as to the result of all this upon
society obtrude itself upon the reflecting; and though many have
doubts, and say that the tilling of the soil is the foundation of
social strength; and are well aware, and indeed feel certain, that
the colonies must undergo a severe trial; yet it is in vain to
endeavour to resist the general movement, and they are hurried
along with the mass, and are off to the mountains for gold. Avarice
seems to be the dominant passion, and the lust for gold "grows upon
what it feeds upon." We had not noticed its effects in this manner
so strongly shown any where as in this community of Kilmore. We do
not say this as a reproach to the people of that locality. They are
not peculiar; the same passion is paramount in every community of
tradespeople; and to make their fortunes is with them the business
of life. Likewise to take advantage of the riches which at the
present moment are within their reach is not only to be commended,
but not to do so would show a great want of energy, enterprise, and
common sense.</p>

<p>It is true that for the time the framework of industrial
enterprise, which has hitherto made Kilmore a prosperous locality,
has been suddenly disrupted; it has become broken and scattered;
yet, as time rolls on, matters will find their level; and fortune
may not be so hard with the squatters in the immediate
neighbourhood, who suffer so much by the desertion of their men.
And as these gold-diggers must live, they considered that the high
price they would obtain for their stock, to feed the increased
population so close to their stations, would enable them to offer
such remunerative wages as would secure a sufficient number of
shepherds, and thereby save their flocks from being exposed to the
attacks of the wild dog and aboriginal savage. As regards the
immediate district of Kilmore, we were assured that the crops would
be secured; many of the farmers had returned from the mines for
this purpose, and after finishing their labours would return to
their new occupation. The hay crop had been already housed, though
at considerable expense; the wages given for this employment were
thirty shillings a week and rations free. Heaping had also
commenced, and men were engaged at 1<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>., an acre; an industrious man could earn at this rate one
pound per day. The crops, they said, that were now ripe would be
got in; but as nearly all the farmers in the district would be
again off to the diggings after that had been done, fears were
entertained for the next year. There is so much "looming in the
future" among these corn-growers at the antipodes, that anxiety is
felt by the timid and by such as cannot keep pace with these
wonderful discoveries; others cannot easily accommodate themselves
to the altered state of society; and no doubt those entrusted with
power will be growing daily more anxious.</p>

<p>Passing onwards for twenty-five miles beyond Kilmore, you arrive
at the Goulburn River, where there is another commencement of one
of these inland towns, which form the stepping-stones to
civilisation in the great interior of this island continent. The
country for the first half of that distance is rather hilly, and
becomes fatiguing work for your horses to go over, and you are
obliged to travel at a slow pace; for nothing knocks up your
faithful charger sooner than a continuous ascent and descent over a
stony track upon a hot summer day. Much of it, however, is fair
pasture-land, with occasional patches of good alluvial soil, which
are easily distinguished from the poorer lands by their luxuriant
vegetation. At a place called "Sandy Creek" we rested for our
noon-day repast, and enjoyed the delicious shade of the Casuarina
trees which overhung the pellucid stream flowing from pool to pool
in the bed of this water-course. From here the aspect of the
country improves, and for the remaining ten or twelve miles you
journey along through more fertile and level land. The glimpses of
the surrounding scenery which open up as you proceed are very
pretty; and as a whole it may be considered a fine rich tract of
country, with plenty of grass on it for sheep and cattle, well
watered apparently, and presenting a number of spots admirably
calculated for homesteads and farms. A short distance before you
reach the banks of the river the country again becomes hilly, and
you have to descend a tolerably steep bank at the crossing-place.
The view from this height up and down the river is very pleasing,
and the waters of the Goulburn present the surface of a deep and
rapid stream. You cross the river here in one of the large punts
used throughout these colonies. They are very clumsy, and are
impelled across by means of a rope fastened on each bank of the
river; at the same time they are admirably adapted for the purpose
of ferrying heavy drays over. This river is subject to considerable
floods; a mark on a tree was pointed out to us as the height to
which the water had risen upon the last occasion. It was many feet
above the alluvial land on the north side of the stream at this
point; hence any attempts at cultivation so low down would stand
the risk of total destruction during those floods. Nothing can
exceed, however, the richness of the soil upon these flat lands. In
many places they are two or three miles broad, extending for twice
that distance along the bank of the river, and are composed of from
ten to twenty feet deep of virgin soil, almost quite clear of heavy
timber, and ready for the plough.</p>

<p>Above the flat lands subject to those floods is the commencement
of a township called Seymour, well situated, and having some
tolerably good houses already finished, and several which had been
begun and abandoned. Even in this embryo township all improvements
were suspended; and those of the working classes who still remained
crowded round the lucky gold-diggers who had returned from Mount
Alexander, and listened to their tales with greedy ears and
wondering eyes, occasionally ejaculating that they would soon be
off and try their luck also. As we were now journeying more distant
from the immediate vicinity of the mines, we indulged in the hope
that we should find more order and less excitement among the
people; but at this place there was little abatement in the
<i>furore</i> which greeted the arrivals from other parts, and we
saw little prospect of enjoying a comfortable night's rest at the
only inn the place could boast of. Certainly, the men were civil
enough; but it will be easily imagined that when so many of the
inhabitants had only returned for a short time to their old
quarters to spend their gold during the Christmas holidays, by
indulging in drunken excesses at the inn, that place would be any
thing but desirable to put up at. In such cases it is quite a
relief to enjoy the quiet repose of a temporary bush gunya, with a
blazing log-fire, not to mention that you escape also from the high
charges of the innkeepers, who do not miss the golden opportunity
of making you pay smartly. About half a mile, therefore, beyond
this village, or commencement of a town, we bivouacked close to the
river side. Our party, upon this occasion, indulged themselves, in
addition to the usual bush fare, with what are called
"Leatheijackets,"&mdash;an Australian bush term for a thin cake
made of dough, and put into a pan to bake with some fat. The term
is a very appropriate one, for tougher things cannot well be eaten;
however, with our keen appetites, we found them very good, and
persons who cannot make a hearty meal on such tough fare should not
venture any great distance from home. The Americans indulge in this
kind of bread, giving them the name of "Puff ballooners," the only
difference being that they place the cake upon the bare coals,
which we do not consider so good a plan as that adopted by the
Australian bushmen.</p>

<p>Our next stage on the road was at a place called Middle-mass,
which will be seen on the map to be about twenty-six miles from the
Goulburn River, and forty-four miles from the Broken River, the
next stream of importance you come to. This place is merely a
roadside public-house, which, before the road was so thronged, was
large and good enough for the passing traveller. Now, however, the
landlord finds his tap-customers the best payers, and neglects
accommodating his gentlemen visitors for his more profitable trade
over the bar. Consequently, as we did the night previous, we
bivouacked in the bush, about three miles beyond the inn, where we
found a small creek with good water in it, and plenty of feed for
our horses.</p>

<p>At this spot we joined a party bent upon the same errand as
ourselves, instead of encountering the disagreeables to be met with
at the public-house. The evening was fine, and as we approached
them we heard a voice merrily singing a song. They proved to be a
party on their way from the Murray River to Mount Alexander. They
were four in number; one of them had with him his young son, and
told us that he was possessed of considerable property, not only as
a squatter but as a proprietor of land within the settled boundary.
His two neighbours, the others of the party, having resolved to try
their fortunes at the diggings, he came with them not so much for
gain as because he would not be left behind. The other two were men
who possessed property likewise, although of less amount; but their
object was specific. They were fully bent on realising some of the
extraordinary sums which were said to be amassed by lucky diggers.
One of them was a tall powerful man about six feet two, perhaps
more. He was apparently very active for so large a man; he had,
they said, a little native blood in his veins; if so, he proved in
his person what a fine race of men the interior of Australia can
produce, and that the animal man will not suffer from an
amalgamation with the aborigines. The other was a Sussex man; he
had been a sailor, and possessed a superior education to the
ordinary run of seamen; and he had a fair right to have looked for
something better than the position of a schoolmaster in a remote
district on the banks of the Murray River, at a place called
Boroogo. However, there he had been resident for some years, a
useful member of that primitive community, and he informed us was
contented, when these great discoveries were made, and the
astounding intelligence reached his obscure quarter; once more he
trusted his fate to fortune and his own exertions, and he and his
party were sanguine of success. They have our best wishes that the
fickle goddess may be favourable to them.</p>

<p>Late in the evening a horseman, with not a very prepossessing
countenance, came to our fire, and asked permission to remain with
us during the night. His request was acceded to; and we soon
afterwards wrapped our blankets close round us, turned our feet to
the fire, and resigned ourselves to sleep. In the morning, when we
all got up, we found to our surprise that this late visitor of the
previous night had departed when all was still, and what was worse,
the four horses of the Murray party were not to be seen; and as
three of them were old bush horses, accustomed to remain about
their carts, it was feared that the stranger had abused the
hospitality he had received, and decamped with some of the animals.
Horse-stealing, or as it is sometimes delicately expressed among
the gold-diggers, "borrowing a horse," is not uncommon in these
times, and you cannot be too much on the alert where so many
thousands are travelling, of all and sundry characters. The
unceremonious departure of the stranger was calculated to attach
suspicion to him, though it turned out unjustly so. In searching
for them we went far around the forest in vain; at length a cry
down the creek from some of the party informed us that they were
seen not far distant from our encampment, where they had strayed to
a green spot to find some better feed. The party from the Murray
soon after pursued their journey towards their destination, Mount
Alexander; and with the reader's permission we will now direct our
steps towards Violet valley, where there is another township,
distant from Middlemass about twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>After passing through the latter place, the character of the
country is of an inferior description for many miles. It, however,
improves as you go on; and when at the end of your journey you
reach Violet town, you find it situated in a most delightful spot,
and its vicinity well covered with grass, having abundance of
water. This town contains but few houses, which no doubt will
increase as the country becomes peopled, for it certainly is a
lovely spot for a quiet residence; and there is every likelihood of
it keeping pace with the most flourishing inland towns, should the
report of the government surveyor prove correct, that the ranges in
its vicinity are richly auriferous.</p>

<p>In this neighbourhood we were informed that the aboriginal
natives are still numerous, although they are lessening in number
every year, until ultimately they will disappear altogether. We
cannot think of these poor people without pain and deep regret; and
sometimes a doubt crosses our mind, whether, nationally speaking,
we have adopted the course towards them which was due to ourselves
to have done. In this province of Victoria many of them have been
made useful as constables, shepherds, stockmen, and otherwise. And
at Sydney we were informed by a respectable squatter from New
England that for many years he had found them most valuable. He,
however, told us that he treated them just as he would treat a
white man&mdash;<i>he paid them</i>; and thus he made it their
interest to labour steadily; so that with him, and others who have
acted as he has done, they have served well. This being the case in
certain instances, there can be no reason why, if people act justly
towards them, similar satisfactory results should not follow in
each of their cases. It would not be the least interesting
consequence of this wonderful discovery of gold in the midst of
their own lands, if it were the occasion of saving the remnant of
what we must call these interesting children of the forest. In many
cases the settlers' necessities will compel them to take what
labour it is possible to obtain. Let them be just to the poor
savage, and they may find labour and assistance where they least
expected it. As an instance of the usefulness of these poor
creatures, we knew of a gentleman who had come from South Australia
to purchase cattle in New South Wales, and who drove them overland
to Adelaide, assisted by ten of the Murray River blacks. His plan
of treatment to them was similar to that in the other instance we
have related. He dealt with them in the manner <i>they themselves
considered just</i>.</p>

<p>The distance from Violet town to the next township, named
Benalla, on the Broken River, is a long eighteen miles. After you
are two or three miles on the road, it takes you for the remainder
of the way through a level open forest; the soil generally of
indifferent quality and but thinly grassed, and some few miles a
coarse sandy clay, full of shallow hollows, in which water remains
for a time: at this season, however, they were dried up. This
latter description of land is what the colonists term "honeycomb"
ground, and is very unsafe to ride over. Occasionally you come to
and cross over water-courses, in which there are small ponds in the
summer, and impassable torrents in the winter. At the time we
crossed them they were mostly dry; and it appeared to us not to be
a well-watered country, nor did we notice the appearance of any
commencement of a homestead during our journey. The day was very
fine, rather too warm an hour or two after mid-day; but the morning
and evening were pleasantly cool.</p>

<p>As you approach Benalla the country improves, and there is much
good soil near the Broken River, over which there is a wooden
bridge communicating between the town on both sides of the river.
This town and its surrounding district has the most thriving
appearance of any we had yet passed on the road. By the census of
1851 its police district contained 3060 inhabitants; 2106 males,
and 954 females. The town itself possesses some excellent hotels
and well-built stores and dwelling-houses, mostly of sawn timber.
It is very much scattered, the flat land on the bank of the river
being subject to floods, upon which were fine trees, giving a
character to the position of the town which was pleasing. The
district all, around was said to be well pastured, and had good
fattening propertied for cattle. All we saw about the place had the
most encouraging appearance. We met several gentlemen, and others
of very respectable and substantial look; and we were informed they
were the neighbouring squatters and farmers up and down the river.
Of course this place suffered from the loss of its working men in
common with all other quarters.</p>

<p>The next stage on the road is to the Ovens River, distant from
Benalla thirty-two miles, having about half-way on the road the
most miserable public-house we had seen on our travels; it is
called the "Fifteen-mile Creek" inn, that being the distance
between it and the place we had left. The intermediate country is
very fair, and much of it tolerably well grassed. Before arriving
at the Ovens you pass over some moderately high hills; and though
the country is generally open forest-land, yet there are
occasionally belts of scrub, with iron-bark and stringy-bark trees.
Sometimes also you see post-and-rail fences, and now and then
encounter a shepherd with his flock of sheep; all indicating that
the country has a large population. A shepherd with his dog, to
whom we spoke as he was crossing the road, informed us that he was
making a short-cut to a station some ten miles above the town of
Benalla on the Broken River. Again, we also met a number of drays
proceeding to Melbourne with wool, and horsemen and pedestrians
bound for the same destination. In fact, with such substantial
signs of occupation, you do not feel that you are passing through
what in England is thought to be nothing but a desolate wilderness.
No doubt the absence generally speaking of architectural objects,
to make a pleasing landscape, are wanting. Forests of the
never-failing gum, day after day, interest but little; and we can
quite understand many people in such a situation feeling painfully
isolated and lonely, and then becoming melancholy. Fortunately we
were not of this temperament; we bore what we could not help, and
made the best of every thing. And we beg to recommend all those who
are of a different or gloomy temperament, not to venture into the
wilderness of Australia, in which they can not only find little to
their taste, but may become oppressed with sadness.</p>

<p>We had proposed to remain for the night at the "Fifteen-mile
Creek" inn, and with that intention our horses were put into the
shed&mdash;here there was no stable; but after taking some
refreshment, and finding every thing most unsatisfactory, there
being also a disturbance in the house, with every prospect of a
general fight, we preferred the chance of a bivouac, and therefore
proceeded for a few miles from the inn, and took up our quarters
for the night at a convenient spot where some wagoners were, and
made the best of it, not permitting ourselves to be annoyed by the
circumstance.</p>

<p>Very early next morning we were saddled and on our journey,
having before our departure indulged in a hot pot of tea, and given
ourselves a good warming; for we must confess that we felt rather
chill upon these occasions just as the day broke. Do what you will
to keep up the fire, you will generally find it nearly out by
day-light; the first thing therefore to do on awaking is to make it
up if you can procure fuel. Your selection of a spot for
camping-out must be bad if this cannot be managed; and you should
always have a reserve of your overnight's supply of wood for this
purpose. Though the days are exceedingly hot in the summer months
travelling in this manner overland, yet you will find the nights
often cold; and a fire before the sun is up, and even after it a
little, is always pleasant and sometimes necessary for comfort.
Comfort! we fancy we hear some persons exclaim; was there ever such
a misappropriation of the word! And yet, after all, comfort is, we
take it, that state of feeling brought about by any means which
acts upon your spirits so that you are revived and feel easy. Be
this as it may, a good fire at daybreak after camping-out all night
in the bush is comfortable. Whilst the fire is blazing cheerily,
and your kettle or quart-pot of water standing by to boil, you
fetch up your horse and make all ready for a start. Then you drink
a pannikin of tea, and eat heartily of such provisions as you have
with you; and after a good warming, or smoke of the pipe, which is
so common here, you mount your horse with comfort, and take to the
road cheerfully.</p>

<p>The reader must not suppose that there is really a necessity to
sleep out between Melbourne and Sydney. As we have said at the
outset of our journey, by managing properly as to your stages,
accommodation, such as any lady would not object to, is always to
be obtained. But with regard to ourselves it was a matter of choice
for us to "bush it;" and if we were travelling the same journey
again, and well provided, we should often prefer it to putting up
at some inns, particularly under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>To the Ovens River it is seventeen long miles, passing over
tolerably good land, and throughout more than the usual amount of
fencing. On the right of the road is a large swamp, and on the left
open grassy forest-land, over which flocks of sheep may be seen
depasturing; and now and then you get a glimpse of an enclosed
paddock under cultivation. The latter portion of the road passes
through a very inferior tract of land, and then alternates with
another good tract as you approach the Ovens River. This river is a
clear rapid stream, about forty yards wide at the crossing-place
and, as the ferryman informed us while we were crossing in his
punt, it was sixteen feet deep. At this place is the township of
Wangeratta, situated partly on the left bank of the river and
partly a little distance from it on a mound, or rising ground
higher than the floods rise, which are sometimes very heavy here.
On the left bank, the highest part of the town, there is a very
comfortable inn, and near it one or two other houses of
accommodation. Altogether it is a straggling sort of place, and
there is not much attempt at uniformity in the plan of the town,
from what we could judge of the position of the buildings. It was
said to possess a considerable population; what number we could not
exactly ascertain, but it was considered much less than Benalla.
Should gold, however, be discovered in the district, of which there
was some talk, and in quantities to satisfy the people, they may
not be tempted away. But indeed no one can tell how the population
would act under such circumstances. In the meantime the news from
Mount Alexander had done its work, as at other towns in the
interior, and it may soon become a deserted village. On the
northern side of the river the alluvial flats are very broad, and
seemingly of good quality of soil: through them are intersected
several natural watercourses, which drain off the water during
floods; across these are built wooden bridges. We should not call
the country very good, though trees are growing there which you see
on the best land; but they are not, however, so large as you
generally find them. The heat during the day was very oppressive,
and we could have enjoyed the influence of the sea-breeze, but we
were too far inland for that; this was added to by the parched
appearance of the herbage. We do not think it necessary to mention
the flocks and herds we met upon every occasion, as it will be
taken for granted that the whole country is occupied by squatters,
with their sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>From the Ovens River to the Murray River is forty-four miles.
Between the two streams is a place called the "Black-dog Creek,"
where there is a house of accommodation, at which we met with great
civility and a clean bed. The landlord had lately flnished a small
house, to enable him to carry on his business more to the
satisfaction of the numerous parties now going past. He has no
neighbours about him; but the situation is one upon which a village
is likely to grow. For eight miles after you leave the Ovens River
your road is through a fine, open, well-grassed forest, principally
of box; after which you enter into and pass over ranges of hills
for nearly the whole remaining distance. This is a very indiflerent
and barren tract of country, having upon it the usual descriptions
of inferior trees, and consisting of rocky ridges of quartz-rock,
ironstone, &amp;c., with scarcely any feed for cattle in the
valleys below. In the lap of these ranges, however, there is a
little oasis, where some solitary settler has built a cottage upon
a patch of fine land. The people at this place informed us that the
country improved lower down; which we found to be the case, and
well watered, with large box-trees, which indicate the presence of
good land. Then follows a tract of inferior country, leading again
into a fine country well wooded and grassed. In many places there
are spots which greatly please you, and the sight of which give
life to the road.</p>

<p>As you approach the Murray River you wind round some hills and
rather undulating country, and at length you arrive at the site of
the new township of Wodenga. The spot is well chosen,&mdash;a
rising ground above the possibility of floods, which are sometimes
tremendous on this Mississippi of the Australian continent. Behind
it are some picturesque hills, and well wooded. Between it and the
Murray there are two miles of alluvial land, also well and finely
timbered; this is liable to be flooded, and through it are many
deep water-courses, over one of which a bridge was lately carried
away by a flood. It is a matter of wide speculation to grope into
the future; but if this township of Wodenga was to become the
terminus of a railway from Melbourne, as we suggested at the
commencement of this chapter, it would be a place of great
importance in the colony of Victoria, as it is the northernmost
township in the province; while Albury, on the opposite side of the
river, is the most southern town of New South Wales; the Murray,
which flows between, being the boundary of the two colonies, as
will be seen on the annexed map. Wodenga is therefore 211 miles
from Melbourne, and Albury 379 miles from Sydney. We had some
difficulty in fording the back water-course of the river, which we
were compelled to do in consequence of the accident to the bridge;
and unless we had had the assistance of a native, who directed us
which way we should incline when we were in the water, we might
have failed in getting safely over. There is inconvenience
certainly, if not danger, in crossing such places with one horse;
but with another leading, as was the case with us, the matter is
increased. Such, however, are the incidents by flood and field,
which are not much thought of in a new country; so we laughed when
we got across the river without any further mishap, and sat down in
the comfortable inn at Albury with increased enjoyment, as it had
been difficult to reach it.</p>

<p>On referring to the map, it will be seen that we have arrived at
the northern boundary of the province of Victoria, and having
crossed the Murray River, we had entered the territory of New South
Wales, The present boundary of the colony is the same which defined
its extent when it was known as the district of Port Philip, and a
dependency of New South Wales. Before its separation from that
colony and its erection into an independent province of the British
empire, the colonists petitioned the imperial government to extend
the territory of the future province as far north as the
Murrumbidgee river,&mdash;which will be seen on the map to include
a large tract of country,&mdash;and to the westward as far as Lake
Alexandrina, in South Australia, annexing the lake-country between,
thus forming a natural boundary in that direction, instead of the
present artificial line drawn in the meridian of 141° east
longitude. The claims of the Port Philip colonists to this
additional territory are, that the settlers within that distance
and beyond the official boundary, ship their produce at their
ports, and receive supplies from their towns; in fact, all their
interests are immediately connected with the colony of Victoria,
although they have to pay their taxes to the adjoining colonies of
South Australia and New South Wales. It was too much, however, to
grant to this already wealthy district; and there has been no
extension or alteration of the old boundaries since separation was
acceded to. This was an act of justice on the part of the
government towards this young colony, which its growing importance
demanded; for her substance was annually drained from her treasury
by the New South Wales government, and applied to the general
purposes of the whole colony; and it will be readily supposed that
the "old lady" kept the largest share for her own improvements.</p>

<p>In spite of this and other drawbacks which cramped the energies
of the colonists, this favoured section of Australia continued to
prosper in a degree unparalleled in the history of British
colonisation; and to show that she only wanted separation to
develop still more her pastoral resources, we have seen that she
doubled the value of her exports during the first year of her
independence: from 7<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. per head of population it
rose to 15<i>l</i>., being as many pounds as it is shillings in the
majority of the British colonies; and this, it must be remembered,
was prior to the recent gold-discoveries; hence the statement shows
more clearly that it will in future exhibit the general
capabilities of this province for the maintenance of a large and
prosperous community without the extraneous product of gold. Its
greater fertility of soil, its richer pasture-lands, its possessing
more permanent streams, and, above all, its central position in the
midst of this group of colonies, marked it out from its first
settlement, in our opinion, as destined to be the most successful
of the Australian dependencies; and with these incalculable
treasures in the midst of its rich pastoral and agricultural lands,
we are not talking extravagantly when we predict that this province
will take the lead in the great future that is opening up for
Australia. Already we may consider that her population equals that
of the elder colony of New South Wales; and it is in vain that the
neighbouring colonies endeavour to stem the tide of emigration from
their shores to its favoured strand, for the influx of immigration
during the year 1852, from the mother country alone, exceeded
50,000; enough, we think, to neutralise any bad effects which might
influence the body politic from the arrival of foreigners from
other lands.</p>

<p>This is as it should be; and the response both the government
and the people of England have made to the cry of the colonists to
come and help them will be received with gratitude by them; for
although in the dearth of labour which has so suddenly overwhelmed
them, they welcome strangers from other lands who come to their
relief, yet they cannot assimilate with them as they would wish in
their domestic relations. They are aliens to that national
individuality which so strongly marks the subject of the British
empire; besides, their habits and customs jar with the homely
observances, and their opinions clash with the time-honoured
institutions which our countrymen have planted, and which have
taken so deep a root in our Australian colonies. Hitherto there has
been nothing to fear from the political bearing of the colonists
themselves, notwithstanding the hue and cry of certain fire-brand
agitators, whom the colonists reckon the mere froth and scum of
their pitcher of humanity. This may not always be the case, if the
colonial minister refuses the privileges of self-government to
those subjects at the antipodes, which every Englishman looks upon
as his birthright. As long as these regions promised to be no more
than a pastoral country, with a thinly-spread population of
shepherds and stockmen, the question was one of small importance;
but now that the far-seeing politician begins to descry upon the
horizon of futurity certain glimpses of a great national
superstructure rising upon the foundation of these infant colonies,
it is time for the magnates of the Colonial Office to be watchful
of coming events. Already this newly-found treasure is attracting
bands of adventurers from all possible parts of the earth, where
the news has spread like wildfire. Cast your eyes thitherward on
the seas of the southern hemisphere, and you will see what a fleet
of foreign sails are directing their course to our Australian
possessions. On they come, men from all lands, conversing in
different tongues, yet mingling in one pursuit; for the watchword
of their mission, in whatever language uttered, means Gold! gold!
As time rolls on, may not these fleets increase, and the
importation of foreigners materially affect the political bias of
the community? It behoves, therefore, the ministers of the Crown to
use their utmost zeal in the cause of their Queen and country, to
retain these possessions undisturbed, by granting liberal measures
to the colonists, and enlarging their community by a wholesome
supply of good and loyal subjects,&mdash;by sending men whom the
colonists should delight in having as husbands for their daughters,
and women who would prove affectionate wives to their sons, so that
the future race of Anglo-Australians may equal in mental vigour and
bodily strength the stock from whence they sprung.</p>

Tumut river&mdash;Cooloek crossing&mdash;Ingion creek and
village&mdash;Topography of the Murrumbidgee river.</p>

<p>At this stage of our journey we had reached the upper branch of
that great stream, the Murray River, which drains the western flank
of the Australian cordillera, and forms a system of waters which
extends in its ramifications over an area of not less than 1400
miles from north to south, and 400 miles from east to west,
covering upwards of half a million of square miles of this
island-continent, or a district five times the area of the British
Isles. This basin, as it is termed, of the Murray River system
includes all the largest rivers in south-eastern Australia: the
upper Murray, or Hume, which we had just crossed, taking its rise
in the Australian Alps, and receiving the waters of the Goulburn,
the Ovens, the Loddon, and other rivers to the south and
south-east; the Murrumbidgee and the Lachlan having their feeders
stretching along the western flank of the dividing range on the
east coast for several hundred miles; and the Darling, flowing from
the north for a thousand miles through the sandy desert in the
interior, and deriving its source in the tropical latitudes on the
east coast. These arms unite, and at the junction below the Darling
form the lower Murray&mdash;a river which may justly rank among the
great ones of the world&mdash;flowing in a mighty navigable stream
for several hundred miles, until it spreads out into the shallow
estuary of Lake Alexandrina, which finally disembogues into
Encounter Bay in the territory of South Australia, without even a
safe boat-channel through its entrance from the Southern Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>If this vast region was not liable to great droughts, it would
be among the most fertile lands in the world. The aborigines, as
well as the settlers, look forward to the return of the periodical
rains, which fill the creeks and lagoons, and give life to all
nature, with the greatest anxiety; for they would appear not to be
certain, and the effects produced by them are oftentimes of a
calamitous nature. Like many of the Australian rivers, the Murray
from this cause frequently becomes a dry bed. Its course can only
be traced at some spots, in the dry seasons, by a succession of
small lagoons or water-holes, as they are familiarly termed by the
settlers. For many miles also it is said to pass between high
cliffs of sand and clay, intersected with belts of brushwood and
sterile forest-land, and also very flat plains, not favourable for
agricultural or even pastoral purposes. We do not apply this
description to the tract of land we passed through on the road to
the crossing place, for certainly the approach to the river from
either side is most cheering, and delights the eye of the traveller
beyond measure. It is lower down the stream, towards the desolate
interior, that the poor land we have mentioned is to be found;
higher up again amongst the mountains from whence it derives its
source the country is described to be charmingly picturesque, and
possessing all that is requisite for man or beast. At the
crossing-place here the river is not more than a hundred and twenty
yards broad and ten feet deep, having a very rapid stream, which we
crossed with some difficulty in a punt.</p>

<p>Albury, as already mentioned, is on the north side of the river,
situated on its bank above the highest flood-mark. It has some very
good brick and weather-board houses, several houses of
accommodation, amongst which is an excellent hotel, and a number of
shops and stores, besides a place of worship, and a court-house,
where a court of petty sessions is held; in short, it is the
commencement of a very good country town, with several hundred
inhabitants, showing indications of prosperity notwithstanding the
desertions to the gold-fields. It is the centre of an extensive
pastoral country in the Murrumbidgee district, well occupied with
squatting stations and a few agricultural farms. The produce of its
environs, and the surrounding country on the north side of the
Murray River, passes through the town on its way to Melbourne, the
nearest market and outport; and the traffic has of course made the
place what it is. Although the town of Albury is within the colony
of New South Wales, still the inhabitants feel that they are, from
this circumstance, members of the Victoria community rather than of
the older colony. It is 379 miles distant from Sydney, with which
it has postal communication twice a week; and this may be said to
be all the regular traffic it has with the capital of the province
in which it is situated. As the population increases, and if people
do not abandon industrious pursuits entirely in this neighbourhood,
it must become a place of considerable importance. This, however,
depends upon the course of events; there is no question but that
there is a field at this locality for the employment of thousands
of industrious people.</p>

<p>At the time we passed through the town there was the greatest
excitement occasioned by the announcement that gold had been
discovered on the "Black Range," a group of hills distant from the
town some four miles; and there were stated to be already several
men at work. Such announcements did not surprise us much, for there
is no question but that the whole of this region through which the
road passes between Melbourne and Sydney is more or less
auriferous, which has been almost verified by the explorations of
Messrs. Hargreaves and Clark, who are employed for this purpose by
the New South Wales government. If our humble judgment also may be
taken into account, we may state that we often noticed localities
externally the same as the auriferous country around Mount
Alexander; in fact, if quartz is to be taken as a certain
indication of the presence of the precious metal, the indications
were frequently most favourable; who can say, then, that internally
these localities will not prove as rich? It is of the greatest
moment to the well-being of the community that these riches should
be found spread generally throughout the land, as that circumstance
will prevent many townships and densely-peopled districts from
being deserted. Every one must be aware, that if all the
able-bodied men abandon the pursuits which hitherto have maintained
the population in plenty and comfort for this gold-digging, it will
become a serious matter for the former employers of labour. The
owners of houses in these small towns were beginning to look very
blank, when they saw so many of their tenants leaving them empty to
people other localities. This shifting of the population will bring
about many curious changes, and like the canvass cities of the
wandering Arab, a town here to-day may be gone to-morrow. All we
trust is, that these changes will be for the general benefit of the
community; for it is clear that if gold-digging should really
become the most profitable occupation for the labourer, most men
will follow it in preference to ordinary pursuits. To prevent the
evil effects which must follow therefrom to the community at large,
it would be a wise scheme on the part of the government to enlarge
the currency by establishing a mint; a step which we think would
lessen the value of this product, and therefore raise other
commodities, thereby preventing any injurious effects to the
pastoral and agricultural interests.</p>

<p>The distance from Albury to the Murrumbidgee River is about 120
miles. The tract of country you pass through is generally fine, and
in some parts very beautiful; still there is a sameness to much
that we have hitherto described. Here an open forest country, there
extensive grassy plains; now we cross a river, and again we ford a
creek, or leap our horses across the dry water-courses. It is also,
in common with many other districts in the colony of New South
Wales, subject to seasons of the severest droughts; and we were
informed that when such a dreadful season occurs, you may have to
travel many miles without being able to obtain a drop of water
either for yourself or your poor animals, and that every thing like
herbage is then entirely burnt up, the country presenting a perfect
desert, in which neither man nor beast can live. Those spots where
there are springs which flow throughout the driest year, are, as it
may be supposed, invaluable. Such a season as it was our fortune to
be favoured with in 1852 is seldom experienced. But even in this
most favoured of years we passed over many water-courses which were
not running, and even frequently found them dried up. Though these
droughts are sometimes very dreadful in their effects upon live
stock, yet they seldom prove injurious to man. Generally speaking,
there is always more or less a deficiency of water in the summer
season, as you get away from the mountains, and occasionally
amongst them when you are some distance from the larger streams or
rivers; yet so fearful a visitation as that which occurred the
summer previous to the one we passed through had not been known for
thirty years. We were informed by a man who had been a resident in
this region for more than that period, that it was a desolating
occurrence which happily seldom came; for although there was at
times a scarcity of this useful element, yet the country was well
watered and all that man could desire. <i>That</i> year, however,
he described as a fearful one; every where throughout the district
thousands of cattle perished for want of water; and it was
impossible to keep the famished animals upon their respective runs,
for they would stray away for miles in search of it. That also an
immense proportion of them were lost by being smothered in the deep
water-holes into which they rushed; and many got bogged and finally
smothered on the borders of muddy lagoons, in struggling towards
the water to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that to husband the water, of which
one year with another plenty falls in Australia, is of the greatest
importance to New South Wales; and that how to effect so important
an object, to save the people from the terrific suffering and
enormous losses occasioned by these droughts, demands the utmost
consideration of the legislature of that colony. And we cannot but
think that if the people of Sydney and elsewhere were to direct
their energies to the real improvement of the country,&mdash;such
as remedying what is required, viz. the want of water, the repair
of the roads, and the construction of bridges, besides keeping such
as have been made in repair,&mdash;in place of wasting their time
in party contests, they would be doing more good for themselves and
the public generally. No one can pass through New South Wales but
must observe that the roads, which have been constructed by
convict-labour, are now becoming almost impassable; and the
question of how they are to be kept in repair must weigh heavily
upon the consideration of those whose duty it is to think of such
matters. The men loudest in their complaints are ever those who
have deprived the government of the labour which it will be found
in these golden times impossible, we fear, to supply. We are not
going to enter here into the prisoner question, nor do we intend to
advocate the renewal of transportation; the general government of
the empire have given up the point, and we think it should strictly
keep faith with the colonists. But we may perhaps be permitted to
observe, that we are under an impression that, if the <i>defects of
the system</i> had been pointed out and remedied&mdash;such as
employing the prisoners solely as the pioneers of
civilisation&mdash;not only would great advantages have been
conferred upon the community at the present crisis, but that their
morality, of which they are so apprehensive, would not have been in
any danger. We may be in error in venturing these remarks in the
face of so much determined opposition in the colonies; but they are
given in the spirit of good feeling for the moral and general
welfare of the Australian people.</p>

<p>Before we leave the banks of the Murray for the north, it may
interest many persons to be informed that it has been proposed to
attempt its navigation with a steamboat one hundred and fifty feet
long and twenty-six feet beam, to be built and
launched&mdash;states a prospectus in circulation in
Adelaide&mdash;at Goolwa, or some other adjacent convenient spot,
and there to be fitted with her engines and stores; to be propelled
by one of Penn's forty-horse power oscillating engines, with double
cylinders; to have double stem-posts and rudders, to enable her to
come round quickly in the shorter reaches of the river, and the
steering apparatus fixed forward; to have sails to assist
occasionally. The boat to have a very commodious after-cabin for
passengers, and likewise accommodation forward for steerage.</p>

<p>Her velocity against the stream with a twenty-one inch draught
of water is calculated at six miles an hour under ordinary
circumstances; and, at this draught, she will have on board the
engine-boiler, one and a half days' fuel, stores, and complement of
hands. During the wool-carrying season the boat to be used as a
steam-tug, in addition to carrying cargo, and to tow a certain
number of lighters carrying the wool.</p>

<p>The tonnage is estimated at 200, from which is to be deducted
the engine and boiler-room, and the stowage for fuel.</p>

<p>It is proposed, at the outset, that the steamboat shall not go
higher than the River Darling junction, where there is to be a
depôt established, with screws for pressing the wool, and, if
expedient, boiling-down works.</p>

<p>The extension of steam-communication to the Murrumbidgee
junction, or beyond or up the Darling, to be carried out hereafter,
as circumstances develop themselves, and for which a smaller
steamer will be necessary.</p>

<p>Immediate receiving depôts to be established where desirable,
between the Goolwa and the Darling,&mdash;say, for example, Ngarto
and Moorundee; and also wooding-stations at intervals of 100 miles.
Port Elliot and Goolwa respectively to have warehouses for
receiving wool and goods, using the railway intended to be
established between these points as a means of transit, on such
terms per ton per mile as may hereafter be settled.</p>

<p>The time of starting on the first trip to be, say first week of
August, and to continue running for seven months; then to be laid
up in ordinary, with a reduced complement of hands, unless
sufficient traffic should present itself to warrant a longer
period, or unless for intermediate or occasional trips.</p>

<p>The voyage from Goolwa to the Darling will occupy seven days and
say, the return voyage six; the complete trip thirteen days, and
one day detained at the Darling depôt; but to allow something
extra, say two trips per calendar month, on the average.</p>

<p>The operations of a carrying company, if successful, might be
extended to the steam country trade, or in cooperation with the
steamers now stated to be about to run from Sydney to various
coasting parts.</p>

<p>The carriage between Port Elliot and Port Adelaide to be a
separate item of arrangement and charge, because it cannot be known
how much may stop at Port Elliot for shipment direct; much must
depend upon the harbour and the season. The quantity of flour
carried up will probably decrease in course of time, as the country
is opened up and cleared, as parties will grow their own grain; but
other things will increase, and so compensate. Great part of the
Wimmera district, extending down to Lake Hindmarsh, will be opened
up. Drays going to the Darling from Adelaide occupy about six weeks
for the journey, and the charge per ton is about 12<i>l</i>., and
the distance by land is about 330 miles.</p>

<p>The resolution of the legislature restricting the draught of
water of the first steamboat to two feet might be increased; and to
this the evidence of all the writings and reports, and the
suggestions of Captain Freeling and Mr. Torrens, go.</p>

<p>Even if the scheme as a commercial one failed (a thing not very
probable), the expenditure would not all be lost; there would be
the boat and its engines, fit for navigating the Gulf in fine
weather. Melbourne is about 350 miles from the junction of the
Darling; sometimes a dray is six months going and returning.</p>

<p>What has been the result of this proposition we have not heard;
our object will be attained if, in laying it before the reader, we
succeed through it in conveying to him what are the supposed
capabilities of these waters in the interior, and what is going
forward in such remote places.</p>

<p>Leaving Albury, the road passes through the Murrumbidgee
district, the largest squatting district in New South Wales, and
watered by the largest rivers in Australia. Before the
gold-discovery it contained about 3000 inhabitants, not more than
one-fourth of whom were females. In 1846 the stock comprised in
this district was 2646 horses, 94,671 head of horned cattle, 800
pigs, and 373,000 sheep. The first twenty miles of the road is
through a flat grassy country, which is said to be more favourable
for breeding than fattening cattle; at the same time there are a
few stations where fat beeves are sent from, particularly those on
the Billibong Creek, which flows through the middle of the district
from east to west.</p>

<p>A short distance from the town you pass by a racecourse, with a
stand of the most primitive construction; it, however, shows a
beginning of this genuine English amusement in the far interior,
and evinces the taste of the inhabitants. The country is not
densely wooded, but there are a sufficient number of trees for
ornament, amongst which we noticed the box, bastard apple-tree,
white and red gums, and some stringy-bark, which grew mostly on the
hilly grounds. When about fifteen miles on the road, you see a
remarkable mountain on your left, about seven miles to the
westward; it is called "Table Top." A very few years since it was a
good object to direct the traveller; now, however, there is no need
of that, the road being excellent and well defined.</p>

<p>In five miles more you arrive at Mullengendra, Mr. Dimmock's
inn, situated a short distance off the road. It is by far the
largest and most complete establishment of the kind we had seen in
the interior; Mr. Dimmock has erected a blacksmith's, a tailor's, a
shoemaker's, and a carpenter's shop. His house is a neat
weather-boarded cottage, with a verandah, and a detached kitchen,
which is so necessary in this hot climate. Altogether it is one of
the cleanest and most comfortable little places to stop at that can
be imagined; and you feel inclined to linger about the spot and
view the surrounding country, which is very pretty and picturesque.
Passing onwards for two miles, the scenery retains the same
pleasing character, when your road leads you in great part for the
next seven or eight miles over a rough hilly country, crossing some
barren stony ridges on the way. You then come to an out-station on
a sheep-run, belonging to Mr. Dixon, called Woomargama, which
consists of a shepherd's hut, and hurdle-yards for the sheep. John
Duke, the shepherd at this station, was very poorly off with regard
to house-accommodation and the creature comforts, but he was rich
in civility. It may give the reader some further idea of the
working of the gold fever in these localities, by our stating that
this man had made up his mind, and was then making arrangements, to
proceed to the gold-fields at Braidwood, taking with him his wife,
his daughter, and two sons, fine active young fellows, who were
serving as shepherds under the same employer as their father. In
the event of his carrying out his intention, it will prove a
serious matter for Mr. Dixon, as he would find it difficult to
supply the places of such a useful family.</p>

<p>There is much of this country enclosed with fences, principally
for horse-paddocks, which are always an indication of the advanced
condition of the settlers; and on the banks of the streams there
are a few fields enclosed and under cultivation. The hills we were
crossing proved to be the Mullengendra range, a spur from the
Australian Alps, which divides the waters of the Billibong from the
Murray; the former giving its name to the extensive tract of land
between the latter and the Murrumbidgee. From hence to Messrs.
Strachan and Gabbett's station at the junction of the Burnet and
the Billibong creeks is sixteen miles, the country between being
partly hilly and partly undulating and level forest-land; it is
well adapted for sheep, and in our journey we passed several large
flocks, with their attendant shepherds. The land upon the banks of
the Billibong is a very deep rich alluvial soil, and we never saw
stronger-looking oats than those which grew at Strachan and
Gabbett's station; they were really more like reeds than straw in
their stems. This is a squatting-station; the proprietors have a
sufficiently good house and out-offices for all purposes requisite
in the bush, besides large paddocks well enclosed with
post-and-rail fences, for horses and entire stock, and smaller ones
for cultivation. The river or creek, as it is termed, passes
through their run. Lower down is the tract of country so well known
for its richness and liability to severe droughts. This particular
locality, and for twelve miles over which the road passes, is truly
beautiful, not having more trees than are sufficient for ornament,
and presenting a perfect picture of what we have termed the
park-like scenery of Australia. Here and there the otherwise
monotonous aspect of the forest is relieved by large open spaces
thickly grassed, with cattle and sheep feeding thereon. You also
cross several alluvial flats, where the kangaroo grass grows as
high as your saddle-girths, which is said to be possessed of good
fattening properties for all kinds of stock; but the proprietors of
the station we had left occupied their land entirely as a
cattle-run. We have much pleasure in recording the civility and
attention they paid us on our calling at their homestead.</p>

<p>Twelve miles farther on you arrive at Massey, a roadside
public-house, situated in a very badly watered locality, and having
not much pretension to comfort. At this spot, during the great
drought of 1850-51, a well was sunk eighty-five feet deep before
water was obtained. The distance between this public-house and
Kiamba&mdash;much such another place&mdash;is seven miles; the
country is more scrubby than the previous twelve miles from the
Billibong, and though it is well grassed, yet it was said not to
possess very fattening properties. The inn at Kiamba is a better
situation for a public-house than Massey, as it possesses a spring
of excellent water, which has never been known to fail. The great
value of water those alone know who have suffered from the absence
of it, and witnessed its dreadful effects upon man and beast in the
arid regions of Australia. We cannot help repeating again our
convictions on this matter, for to secure it in these upper regions
of New South Wales is the great question for solution by the
colonists. And whenever we hear of them wasting their time in
premature discussions, often without just cause, concerning their
liberties, and what they call their grievances, and see that they
neglect essential things, such as we have named, we not only lament
that men should permit morbid feelings to govern them at the
expense of the country, but we have some doubts of the political
talent claimed by these agitators of the Australian community. We
are strongly impressed with the opinion that these patriotic
gentlemen frequently take up the cudgels of politics against the
government, more to gratify their own vanity and turbulent
dispositions than from any utility they expect from the measures
they advocate. These remarks are not put forward to raise political
discussion; but as a passing traveller, apart from local
prejudices, we could not but see the neglect with which things of
the greatest consequence were treated, while matters of much less
import to the welfare of the colonists commanded so much attention
from the community.</p>

<p>We were well entertained at the public-house at Kiamba and found
the landlord a good sample of his class. He informed us that the
house and grounds were the property of Mr. Walker, a merchant at
Sydney, who was endeavouring to form an extensive vineyard in that
locality, and that they had succeeded in making a tolerably good
sort of port wine. From Kiamba to Tarcutta, the commencement of an
inland town, it is about seventeen miles, through an open forest
country, and in many places pleasingly undulating, and affording
rich pasture for sheep and cattle. We saw some fine flocks and
herds on our way, besides many horses, which seemed to thrive well
in this district. We observed, likewise, abundant indications
amongst the quartz formation, which cropped occasionally through
the land, that there is great probability of auriferous deposits
being found in the vicinity. At one creek in particular, about six
miles from Tarcutta, we were confident that gold would be
found.</p>

<p>This district, in the early settlement of the country, was
thickly peopled by the aborigines; and we thought it extraordinary
that we did not see any about. We fear that there is too much truth
in the tales occasionally related by the settlers of the fierce
contests which occurred between them and the first adventurers
across this region, which to a certain extent has thinned them out.
It seems strange also that these sharp-sighted children of the
forest had not possessed themselves of the golden treasures which
were under their feet, for they are covetous of any polished shell
or stone, and certainly they possess most extraordinary power of
sight. The following description of hunting the bee for honey
amongst the tribes of this region may not be uninteresting to many
persons; and it is a proof of any thing but stupidity in these
unjustly treated natives of Australia.</p>

<p>This pursuit, from all we have heard, seems to possess for the
aborigines something more of the feeling of the sportsman than that
with which they follow their daily search of hunting for food. In
the heat of a summer day they watch this tiny insect (for the bee
of Australia is very much smaller than ours) on the banks of a
lagoon, where they come to drink. They have in readiness a
particular kind of grass, which they put between their teeth, and
having previously taken a mouthful of water, they discharge,
through the grass, a small shower like dew over the bee, which
drenches their little victim, when it is carefully withdrawn from
the water, otherwise uninjured, on the point of a stick. They are
prepared with a little bag of a kind of pipe-clay or fuller's
earth, with which to dry their fingers, and render them more fit
for the very delicate process they are now to commence. A single
fibre of a fine down, found under the wing of the eagle-hawk, is
dipt into the glutinous juice of a particular herb they have in
readiness, also carefully preserved. But the heat of the sun has
dried the bee, and it begins to plume its little wings. The
discharge of small rain is again ejected over him. The minute
operation of attaching the little streamer of down is now proceeded
with; it soon dries, and off he flies, winging his way direct to
his hive, scarcely encumbered with the unusual floating tail.</p>

<p>The halloo is now given, and the whole tribe, with loud shouts,
<i>keeping the game in view</i>, follow it in full cry, till fairly
lodged in the hive, which is sometimes at a considerable distance,
and generally in the top of a very high tree without a branch,
except those that make the summit.</p>

<p>One of them now ascends the smooth stem, making small notches in
the bark with his tomahawk, till he has formed a ladder, by which
he reaches the branches, and soon plunders the store at the top.
His descent with his liquid prize is still more critical, having to
feel his frail footsteps below him; for a fall from such a height
would inevitably prove fatal.</p>

<p>We could mention many other instances of their keenness and
perseverance as hunters, and their expertness at the use of their
weapons, besides their capabilities of being taught ordinary bush
occupations, which would go far to refute the condemnation of being
devoid of intelligence, under which they suffer. It is our hope
that some solid advantages may accrue to them in consequence of the
great changes taking place throughout the labour-market of these
colonies.</p>

<p>Tarcutta is the commencement of what will probably be a
considerable country town. There is already a small nucleus of
well-built brick houses, around which it is likely to congregate;
and like its neighbours already passed on the road, it possesses
some good inns and stores. It has postal communication with Sydney
every Tuesday and Friday. The creek upon the banks of which it is
built is a strong running stream for nine months in the year, and
it has never been known to fail. A few miles above this embryo
town, towards the source of the stream, at a place where the
veteran colonist, Mr. McArthur, formerly had a station, it is
always a clear running brook the whole year round; and at the
crossing-place it was so deep that we were almost afraid we should
have to swim our horses over. Altogether this part of the
Murrumbidgee district is well watered, whatever the rest may be;
and this fact was shown to be constant, from the luxuriance of the
forest and pastoral vegetation around.</p>

<p>From Tarcutta to Gundagai, the next post-town, is about
thirty-five miles; having, when we crossed the country, only one
small public-house, kept by Mr. Cater, about seven miles on the
road. Since then another license has been granted for a house seven
miles still farther on. On the left of the road, after you leave
Tarcutta, there is a long swamp; and throughout the whole distance
it may be considered a better cattle than a sheep country. Although
the scenery of the country as you pass along appears full of the
varieties of hill and dale, still there is nothing striking in it
for the eye of the traveller to rest upon. After leaving Cater's we
ascended and crossed over Tarcutta range, which is a most difficult
matter for drays to accomplish; and in rainy weather next to
impossible for any wheeled carriage, having much of a load, to get
over. As we journeyed along up and down the steep pinches and boggy
ground, we encountered some bullock-drivers and carters
endeavouring to surmount these obstacles with their teams; the
cursing and swearing they indulged in occasionally was not very
complimentary to the members of the Legislative Council. Descending
the range we entered a valley where the country for two or three
miles was well clothed with grass, and about that distance is
intersected by a creek running north in the direction of the
Murrumbidgee River. A shepherd whom we spoke to, as he was
following a fine flock of sheep, informed us that it was called
Ellis's Creek. At times he said there rushed down its course
tremendous freshes, which overflowed the surrounding plains. To the
right of this valley is a tolerably good undulating country, which
does not change much in appearance until you come upon the
Murrumbidgee River, which opens out before you in all the
magnificence of Australian scenery. Large and beautiful natural
meadows stretch along its banks, contrasting their verdant hues
with the dark-blue surface of the river.</p>

<p>The road is some distance from the river, and you lose sight of
it for a few miles, and then you pass over some rather inferior
country until you arrive at Mitchell, a little off the road to the
left, with this fine river at its back. When you come in sight of
the river again the scenery is truly beautiful,&mdash;impossible,
we thought, to be finer. Here you see it flowing through extensive
rich grassed meadows, with a few clumps of trees interspersed over
them, and at their back gently sloping ranges covered with verdure,
and that open forest-land which indicates fertile soil. The banks
of this river, in fact, present a succession of ornamental parks
that would vie with the finest forest-lands in the world. At this
point you leave the river again, the road passing through alternate
patches of fine sheep and cattle country and scrubby tracts, rather
hilly, with iron-bark trees. This description of land continues
until you reach a small creek, where you again ride over rich soil,
and come to enclosed land on each side of the road. You are now
about six miles from the town of Gundagai, which you come to on the
south side of the river.</p>

<p>Gundagai is situated in the district of Lachlan, 244 miles from
Sydney. It stands on the north bank of the Murrumbidgee River, and
is built upon a piece of rising ground between the river and its
back-water. It has suffered from floods more than any town in
Australia, and fears have been entertained by the inhabitants that
some day they and their houses may be all swept away. In 1845 they
petitioned the government of Sir George Gipps to grant them
allotments above these flood-marks; but that governor, true to his
policy of increasing the funds of the Treasury, said, that he would
be happy to put up new sections of ground for sale upon the spot
where it was not subject to those floods, but he could not think of
exchanging the old ones for them, for what they had already
purchased "they had taken for better for worse." <a name=
"betterorworse" id="betterorworse"></a>[* See long note at end of
<a href="#endchapter11">this chapter</a>.]</p>

<p>There are many good houses in the town, and before the
gold-discoveries a considerable population. But this is just one of
those places that will lose the body of its people, unless
discoveries of gold be made in the neighbourhood, notwithstanding
the beauty, extent, and fertility of the country around it. The
town itself is surrounded and hemmed in by a range of hills about
three miles long by two in breadth. From its position, some persons
are inclined to disparage it; we, however, had no such feeling. It
is true that we saw it under the most favourable circumstances;
nothing could exceed the verdure on the plain or low land for
several miles before you reach the township, furnishing abundance
of food for sheep and cattle; whereas the year before, the cattle
were dying in thousands from the excessive drought. Here, as at
other places, nothing was spoken of, thought of, or dreamt of but
gold! Alas, poor Industry, what will become of you in the
gold-regions of Australia!</p>

<p>The Tumut River, a tributary of the Murrumbidgee, joins it not
far from hence. On this river is a mountain called the Bugong
mountain, from the native name given to a kind of moth about the
size of a humble-bee, which is found in abundance there. The
natives feast on this insect when in its grub state at certain
seasons, and get fat upon it. The moth in its perfect state is
found in the caves round this mountain in vast numbers, along with
another of these edible caterpillar-moths, called by them the
Jimberroobra.</p>

<p>Ten miles from Gundagai you cross the Murrumbidgee River again
at a place called Coollock. For the first three miles on the road
you pass over the same description of beautiful meadow-land we have
mentioned as seen lower down. These flats, as they are called,
reach for several miles, frequently back from the river, where they
are bounded by sloping ranges of hills covered with grass, and
thinly timbered. Generally speaking, all fertile lands in Australia
appear to be characterised by these beautiful features. At this
place we crossed the Murrumbidgee from the south to the north bank,
and we should say that it was 120 yards wide, and we were told
about ten feet deep. The punt we crossed in was very much out of
order, like every thing else which we met in our travels requiring
labour to keep them in repair, and not immediately connected with
the gold mania. There is an inn at this place, and a few cottages
on the south bank. After crossing the river, you keep along a range
of hills covered with indifferent soil and rough stony ground. In
many places, according to our judgment, there were indications of
gold. Leaving the river here, you enter again a fine open country,
and pass through a broad level valley with a running creek at the
bottom. There is plenty of grass and large trees about, of the most
luxuriant foliage. But beautiful and luxuriant as all vegetation
was when we passed through, we were assured that in the previous
year every thing was parched up for many long and weary months; and
the cattle, which now looked so well, were then dying by
thousands.</p>

<p>This description of country extends for several miles on the
road to Jugion creek, distant from Coollock fifteen miles,
continuing through a valley in which there is much cultivation,
with a solitary dwelling here and there. Heavy torrents sometimes
rush down this valley from the "Money money" ranges, in which it is
situated, and carry away much of the soil and standing crop. We saw
the effect of one of these sudden floods which had occurred a few
days previously. To Jugion from there is about nine or ten miles,
over a succession of tolerably well-grassed hills, occasionally
rough, and in some places thickly timbered. When within about a
mile and a half of Jugion, on the right bank of the
Murrumbidgee&mdash;of the valley of which you command a fine
view&mdash;you see the village before you. There are two very
indifferent inns in the place, and a few poor-looking houses
scattered about; amongst them we passed what was called a
blacksmith's shop. It is, however, but the commencement of a
village; and should the traffic increase at this part of the road,
might become a place of some size, for there is a good deal of fair
arable land in its vicinity.</p>

<p>From this point we left the Murrumbidgee River, and pursued our
course towards Yass River, a tributary of this stream. Before
leaving it, the reader may wish to be informed of its topography.
It takes its rise in the Maneroo district, about 250 miles
south-west of Sydney, and pursues its course in a tortuous manner
for more than 500 miles, when it is said to expand itself over the
country until it reaches the marshes of the Lachlan. The country
through which it flows is spoken of as possessing great
capabilities for stock and agriculture. From what we had an
opportunity of seeing of it, our impression was that it fully
deserves the praises it has received in such respects. To these
advantages we do think that with regard to mineral wealth it may
yet be found to equal other districts. Of the river itself, there
is more about it which resembles the murmuring streams of the old
world than any others we have seen in Australia. The sloping banks,
the pebbly beach, laved by the clear waters of this noble stream,
all possess that picturesque and poetic beauty which characterises
the rivers of our fatherland. And when in future times the coming
generations will build great cities on its banks, and navigate its
waters by steamboats, it will not be unlike the Rhine of classic
song; and pilgrims from the poverty-stricken lands of the north
will be found wandering along its shores to the shrine of gold
hidden in the veins of the Australian cordillera.</p>

above was written the catastrophe predicted by the unfortunate
inhabitants actually took place in the month of May 1852. The
subjoined extract relates the particulars of this deplorable
event:<br>
<br>
"The Flood at Gundagai.&mdash;'I forward an account of a dreadful
flood we have been visited with at Gundagai. Though the river had
been rising for some days previous, it was not till late on the
night of the 24th that apprehensions were entertained of a high
flood. Several families on the lowest part of the town, on the
north bank of the river, moved during Thursday to a place of
safety. By Thursday night the river had risen to an alarming
height, and the rush of the water became terrific. This continued
during the whole of that night and the following day. As daylight
broke in on Friday morning, the unavailing cries for assistance
became fearfully harassing. Crash after crash announced the fall of
some house, and the screams that followed the engulfing of those
who clung to it, till the water attained its greatest height, about
eleven o'clock at night, and it began to fall at three a.m. on
Saturday. Up to this time about thirty-four houses had been washed
away, and sixty lives lost. Numbers who were carried away by the
stream saved themselves by clinging to trees. I myself was on a
tree from eleven on Friday night until about three o'clock on
Saturday afternoon. Many were so placed for two nights; some of
these were saved, though no doubt several perished from exhaustion.
One melancholy instance is that of Miss Hemphill, who on Saturday
night was alive in the tree in which on Sunday she was found dead.
Those on the high ground exerted themselves to the utmost. Two
strangers manned a boat, and took several from the
trees,&mdash;myself amongst the number. The black fellow, Jackey,
belonging to Mr. Andrews, afforded in this respect the most
valuable assistance, saving a great many lives. The scenes on the
high part, where the remains of the inhabitants are congregated, is
truly distressing. At every step you see some one lamenting the
dead; here and there the sorrowing remains of what three days
before was a large and thriving family. Mr. Thatcher saved himself,
but lost eight of his family. Mr. Lindley returned to-day from a
journey to Yass, and found the whole of his family swept away.
There are few that lived on the flat that have not to lament the
loss of some relation; nearly all are penniless. The distress that
existed has been relieved as much as possible by the sympathy and
kindness of those whose houses and property are uninjured. The
generous hospitality of Mr. Norton, chief constable, will ever be
remembered by those to whom his house became a home, when they were
without shelter, and many almost penniless. Messrs. Caddington,
Bourke, Boland, and others with whose names I am acquainted,
excited feelings of the most lively gratitude, by their sympathy
and kind exertions to relieve all who came on shore. Mr. Morley
distributed provisions and blankets, and exerted himself to the
utmost in getting those saved who were placed in danger. The
following is the list of those who were drowned, amounting to
sixty-four. The number of houses swept away is about thirty-six:
Mr. and Mrs. M'Kenna, of the National School, and five children:
Mr. Hunt, saddler, formerly of Parramatta, wife and four children;
Mrs. Lindley, of the Rose Inn, and four children, old man, servant
man and woman, little girl, woman, and child; Mr. Luff, of the
Murrumbidgee, staying at the Rose Inn; Mrs. Thatcher, sen., Miss
Thatcher, Mrs. Thatcher, jun., and five children; Mr. Gormly, Mrs.
Gormly, daughter, and two sons, and two girls (lodgers); Mr. Scott,
butcher, wife and son, and boy (Castleton); Mr. Gerard Hemphill,
innkeeper, wife, and four children; Mr. Egerton, tailor, and wife;
Mr. Morris and two children; four strangers, staying at Spencer's
Inn, from the Lachlan; Williams, servant to Mr. Spencer; Dr.
Waugh's servant.'<br>
<br>
"Gundagai is, or we may more truly say was, situated on the north
bank of the Murrumbidgee. Most of the allotments were on a tongue
of land between the river and a creek which separated it from the
high land. When the creek and river rose together, as has generally
happened, the unfortunate people were cut off from any means of
escape. This appears to be the case in the present instance. When
the residents were convinced there was danger, and saw the raging
river rise to their very doors, the creek prevented them getting to
the high lands, and they were compelled to remain until the floods
attained sufficient height and strength to wash away their
dwellings, and launch them into eternity. Many of the unfortunate
individuals who are gone to their last account are much to blame
for building in a place which they must have known was liable to be
flooded; but the government officers who laid out a township in
such a position have a most serious responsibility in this matter.
After the township was laid out, application, on the ground of its
being exposed to floods, was made to the government to shift the
site, and allow those who had purchased allotments to change them;
but they were sternly refused. We need do no more than call the
attention of our readers to the simple narrative of our
correspondent, to enlist their sympathies for the survivors. Many
who, before this awful visitation, were in easy circumstances, are
now destitute. There can never be a more legitimate call upon the
affluent for assistance than the present. Whatever is done should
be done quickly."&mdash;<i>Sydney Morning Herald.</i>]</p>

<p>The observant reader, who has followed us thus far upon our
journey, must have noticed that our progress has never been once
stopped by the inclemency of the weather, and that we bivouacked at
nights in the open air with impunity; not that we travelled
entirely free from a wet jacket, for occasionally we encountered
smart showers; but these served only to refresh the arid face of
nature in that region, and make the landscape more brilliant than
before, while our clothes would become wet and dry alternately
without producing any of those serious results on the constitution
which occur under similar circumstances in the mother country.
Scarcely a day passed but we had the clear blue sky visible to
soften the glare of the strong sunlight; notwithstanding the heat
of the weather, we felt a buoyancy come over our spirits which was
quite invigorating; and instead of feeling that lassitude which
deadens the appetite in hot climates, we ate our homely meals with
a zest which the epicure might well have envied.</p>

<p>It was at such times that the idea would recur to us, what a
glorious climate this is for the restoration of broken-down
constitutions, where the invalid from a tropical region, or the
dying patient from the bleak north, will find a healing balm in the
salubrious atmosphere of this favoured country. Here the heavens
are bright&mdash;brighter than the far-famed skies of Italy, the
seasons are genial&mdash;more genial than those of the
health-inspiring Madeiras; the atmosphere is transcendently pure,
there is no death-dealing malaria to poison its sweet breath,
whilst by its life-giving influence it checks the progress of that
fell destroyer consumption; and while it furnishes the wealthy with
those productions which make life all that is to be desired, it
yields that abundance of food which all communities are toiling
for. Here the luxurious man can indulge his appetite in the most
luscious viands and fruits, in a land where the grape, the
pine-apple, and banana grow in the open air; and the labourer can
make his table groan under the giant vegetables which accompany his
cheap beef and mutton. This is essentially the poor man's country,
independently of the treasures his labour can extract from the rich
earth; for besides the abundance of necessaries and comforts it can
furnish for the inner man, its genial climate enables him to
dispense with expensive clothing for the outer man. The winters are
so mild that you rarely feel the necessity of wearing a topcoat,
and for eight months in the year the labouring population seldom
wear coats at all. It will readily be imagined, therefore, that you
have more frequently to adopt means to cool yourself here than
otherwise; although the extreme heat produces no baneful effects
upon the temperate constitution, still it creates many animals and
insects in the country, which are not only annoying but often
dangerous to man.</p>

<p>The day we travelled from Jugion to Yass town was very sultry,
and we found the flies most troublesome. We overtook two men
journeying the same way as ourselves, one on horseback, the other
on foot; they were residents in the district, and spoke well of the
country generally, expressing a hope that the government would
extend the system of selling land in small lots, as was announced
in the <i>Gazette</i> to have been begun in other districts; from
such a system they expected much good would accrue to the
community, as it would retain the population on the soil, and
prevent them rushing away to the gold-fields. While chatting away
in this manner, the man on foot suddenly cried out, "A snake! a
snake!" Our horses bounded and dashed forward, instinctively
knowing the danger. On looking down upon the road, we saw the
reptile close under our horses' feet; we soon passed over it, and
when beyond danger turned round and pulled up. The man on foot
without much difficulty killed the reptile, when it proved to be a
brown snake upwards of five feet long; this is a venomous species,
and a bite from it would have been fatal to either man or horse. It
was the first snake we had seen on our journey; and they are not
often met with by the colonists, who carry on a war of
extermination against them.</p>

<p>We did not travel along the main road from the inn at Jugion
towards Yass, which is considered to be forty miles; for we struck
off the road to the left, along a by-road up the valley of the
Jugion, to the hospitable residence of Mr. Manning of Cumbamurro,
situated in the district of Binalong or Lachlan, on the Jugion and
Cunningham creeks, twenty-one miles from the main road, and thirty
miles from Yass. We did not find the country through which we
traversed either so picturesque or so valuable as that bordering on
the Murrumbidgee; the ranges of hills appeared often poor and
gravelly, with rocks of the quartz formation cropping out; yet
though thinly grassed, these hills afford sweet pasture for sheep,
and the flocks we passed on our way looked well. There was plenty
of water in the Jugion, but the branch creeks were dry; and as we
came from time to time to a shepherd's hut, we found them situated
near water-holes.</p>

<p>Cumbamurro is a beautiful spot in the midst of these hills. The
residence is built in the cottage style, sufficiently large for
even town comforts, well furnished and complete in every respect
for the home of a gentleman and his family. It overlooks a broad
valley, much of which is under cultivation and enclosed, having in
front of it a very tastefully-arranged garden, with many choice
exotics and fruit-trees. In the distance and surrounding the estate
on every side are moderately high hills covered with grass and well
timbered; the road to Yass is seen passing over them. At the back
of the house are such buildings as are requisite for conducting the
operations of an extensive squatting-station, surrounded with
cattle-yards and sheep-pens. Here you meet with those refinements
that give value to life, and which alone can be found where an
amiable and cultivated woman presides; without her man would be but
a solitary and rude being in those remote localities, coming in
contact as he does with the rough-and-ready men of the bush; with
her all is cheerfulness, and he toils on hopeful of the future.</p>

<p>From Cumbamurro we proceeded by Binalong, the head-quarters of
the commissioner of crown-lands for the district, to
Broughtonsworth, the residence of Mr. Broughton, distant about
twenty miles. The country we passed through was good pastoral land,
and we were informed that the grass possessed good fattening
properties for cattle. This estate is situated upon the left bank
of the Boorowa River, a stream of considerable breadth; and at this
place deep enough, and constantly flowing, so that it forms a
boundary between the properties on each side of it, across which
cattle and sheep cannot stray. On referring to the map, it will be
seen to fall into the Lachlan River, after pursuing a tortuous
course of about sixty miles. It is full of fine fish; an advantage
which the tributaries of the Lachlan have over the more southern
streams, which have their sources in the western range of
mountains. This river separates the squatting district of Arden,
which includes part of the Lachlan and Lower Darling, from the
county of King, which is represented in the Legislative Council by
Mr. W. Macarthur.</p>

<p>Broughtonsworth is a very retired spot even among those
solitudes, and is out of the way of general travellers, making it
rather a lonely residence; but it has many advantages in the
goodness of the country and the excellence of its climate. The
plains in its vicinity, which take their name from the river, known
as the Boorowa plains, might be more appropriately called downs;
they are not so extensive as the neighbouring plains of Yass, and
have more trees scattered over them. They are likewise considerably
elevated above the surrounding country, which you are aware of in
coming from the Murrumbidgee River, there being a constant ascent
all the way. The view which opens up before you on this elevated
land is very fine. You see the extent of the country to advantage,
which appears open and good, although we were informed that it was
not always well supplied with water; however, as the population
increases, that is a disadvantage against which the skill and
enterprise of the community will, it is to be hoped, contend
successfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Broughton is a very old settler, one who has fairly taken
root in the country, and reared up a family of Anglo-Australians
about him; and that which would be very solitary to new-comers of
the tender sex, is to his lady and daughters quite natural; they
enter fully into all that is going forward on the station, and have
made it a comfortable home. He and his kind lady gave us a very
hearty welcome, which we have much pleasure in recording. The
improvements upon this property are of a superior description to
what you generally find upon a mere squatting-station, the place
being his own freehold. His first dwelling was a small wooden
cottage, from which he had but lately removed into a capital
brick-built house. Around there is a great deal of fencing, with
out-offices and all that is requisite for his establishment. His
wheat crop was the finest we had seen, and promised to yield an
abundant return. In these remote districts there is seldom more
corn grown than is necessary for each establishment; but as the
mineral treasures of the colony develop themselves, there will be a
good market within a reasonable distance of such fertile
localities, where large bodies of non-producers of food will
congregate with the means from their gold-digging operations to pay
handsomely for their flour. The capabilities of this particular
region as a corn-growing country are very great, and a market alone
is necessary to prove its fertility.</p>

<p>From Broughtonsworth to Yass is about thirty-five miles. On the
road you pass several farms, the paths leading to them striking off
in all directions, so that you are in great danger of missing your
way among them. The whole line of country through which you travel
is above the average description of Australian pastoral land, and
in many places exceedingly picturesque. There is a large population
in the district, and many establishments similar to what we
described at Broughtonsworth. Within about six miles of Yass you
leave the by-paths to these stations, and come into the main
southern road from Sydney to Melbourne, After an hour's ride along
this well-beaten track you enter the town of Yass, prettily
situated upon the north bank of a river of the same name, giving
its name also to the surrounding plains, which are of great extent,
and resembling much the best portions of the South Downs in Sussex.
The town has, or rather, we should say, had a very considerable
population. As, however, there is a likelihood of the precious
metal being found in its vicinity, from particles having been
picked up near the river, those who have left for gold will
probably return, should this division of the territory prove to be
as rich as its neighbours. Men are very much the creatures of habit
in this respect, even amongst the erratic population of Australia;
and this is really a very pretty place to reside in, exceedingly
healthy, and the country in every direction beautiful, Yass then
would become the centre to which the miners would resort for their
supplies; and the rich agricultural lands in its vicinity would
produce all the grain required for the support of a large
population. Already Yass presents the appearance of a very
well-built country town, possessing some substantial edifices of
stone, with the usual complement of inns and stores, besides a
court-house. Before you cross the river, on the south side there is
a flour-mill, having a good command of water. Altogether, we were
very much pleased with the position and appearance of this town,
and feel assured that, possessing so many advantages as it does,
there is every probability of its progressing rapidly after the
re-action takes place upon the altered condition of the colony.</p>

<p>Our resting-place in this delightful locality was at the
hospitable residence of Mr. Henry O'Brien of "Deuro," the native
name of his estate, situated on the rising ground above the river,
about two miles from Yass, commanding a splendid view in every
direction. All about this establishment is in the best of order, as
regards garden, grounds, and house,&mdash;the latter may be fairly
called a mansion; and the whole is such, that any gentleman of
fortune in England would be well pleased to occupy. The estate is
of considerable extent, and there is a great portion of the land
enclosed and under cultivation. The approach to the house from the
main road is through some cleared land for half a mile, the
intermediate space being an enclosure from the beautiful plains of
Yass. Many of our readers may perhaps be surprised to hear that in
the interior of New South Wales establishments such as this should
have arisen; but if they will reflect that a great many of those
who have been the pioneer-settlers in the Australian wilderness
were not only men of enterprise, but of education and taste, they
will cease to wonder; men who had determined, with such means as
they possessed, to work out their fortunes in a distant land, away
from the cares which press often heavily upon the spirits of so
many in a country circumstanced as England is, and as every old and
populous state must be, more or less. To these men may be ascribed
the high tone of intelligence which guides the affairs of these
infant colonies. To their means and energies do we attribute the
success of the educational schemes and other useful works of a like
nature which have been implanted in the colony, as well as the
advance in its material prosperity. And we are not stating more
than the truth when we publish the fact, that the maintenance as
well as the establishment of successful free colonisation on the
Australian shores, is the work of their high intelligence,
unceasing industry, and indomitable perseverance. Mr. O'Brien is
one of those men; and in Australia there are hundreds, nay
thousands, like him in spirit, if not in fortune.</p>

<p>As in England there prevails an annual practice amongst country
people of visiting town, and the towns-people visiting the country
at certain seasons, so in Australia a similar custom is growing up,
particularly among the old colonists of New South Wales. The season
in Sydney is looked forward to by the families of the settlers with
the same anxiety that a London season is to "our country cousins,"
and the Sydney residents are not disinclined to pay a visit to
their friends in the interior. This is as it should be; the
intercourse occasioned thereby is favourable in every way, and it
is thus that the homely institutions of the mother country take
deep root in the affections of her children in whatever spot of the
earth their lot may be cast. And as to dullness in what is called a
"bush life," none experience it excepting those who would be dull
wherever they happened to be.</p>

<p>Within a mile of Mr. O'Brien's is the residence of Mr. Hume, a
gentleman known to the world from his enterprise in exploring this
colony in its early history, beyond the western mountains, and who
discovered the upper branch of the Murray, or as it is sometimes
called after him, Hume River. His residence, although very
beautiful, is not equal to Mr. O'Brien's. On the opposite side of
the river is a charming view of a windmill, which gives a novel
feature to the landscape in this locality.</p>

<p>Proceeding from Deuro in a southerly direction you come again to
the Murrumbidgee River, nearer its source than when we left it
before making the Yass River. On its banks, and not far from Cavan,
the residence of Mr. Potter, are some very wonderful limestone
caves. Mr. O'Brien very obligingly proposed a trip to them, but
time could not be spared by us for that; we cannot, however, resist
giving a description of these caves, and the banks of the
Murrumbidgee near them, upon which we can rely.</p>

<p>The view of the surrounding country is very picturesque, and the
Murrumbidgee is here a running stream with a good deal of water in
it, flowing circuitously through a very broken country. There are a
few alluvial flats to be seen; but the banks are chiefly hilly, and
bounded by rather high ranges, thinly timbered and covered with
grass, so that the whole view of the river meandering over its
stony bed is very beautiful. It is rather too extensive to be
considered a snugly sheltered valley, and yet it is nothing more
than a valley of broken ranges of limestone hills. Arriving at the
caves, you enter by a narrow fissure, a little way up the side of a
hill, rising out of a deep valley, which is so covered by loose
rocks that no one would suppose there was any opening. Passing into
the cave for some distance, its floor slopes inwards, and a few
dozen yards bring you to a spacious chamber, with lofty walls and
roof of uneven surface, presenting some most fantastic shapes and
appearances. But there are here very few stalactites; it seems
composed mostly of the limestone rock encrusted by calcareous
deposits. Scrambling for some considerable distance along a rugged
and difficult path, sometimes through very small apertures, on
hands and knees, at other times surmounting high rocks; sometimes
through caves opening out like the first into spacious apartments,
at other times through narrow and low passages,&mdash;you come to a
most beautiful specimen of calcareous spar, called Ebden's-altar,
from its resemblance to that sacred table; it is a mass of
crystallised though opaque stalactite like a mound, with a thin
covering of the same material, in colour and appearance resembling
alabaster, hanging over it; altogether it is an extraordinary and
beautiful object. These caves are so numerous that probably not
one-half of them have been explored. They are certainly worth
visiting, where the traveller has time to spare.</p>

<p>As our narrative purports to give the reader a faithful
description of these now interesting regions, we shall be excused
if our expressions strike the ear as monotonous; for the repetition
of such phrases as "open forest-land," "well grassed," "scrubby,"
and such like, are truly descriptive of the scenery; and their very
repetition may convey to the reader some idea of that monotony
which characterises the aspect of the country generally.</p>

<p>From the hospitable mansion of Mr. O'Brien we struck again into
the Sydney road. For the first eight miles or thereabouts you
travel through the most beautiful country in every respect; open
forest-land, with large spaces free from trees, well grassed and
park-like. You then ascend and pass over a range of rather high
hills, which continue until you reach the "Gap," sixteen miles from
Yass. At this stage of the road there is an inn having much better
accommodation than you would expect; there is some cultivation
about it likewise, and it is well situated with regard to water.
The road over these hills does credit to those who have the keeping
it in repair, considering that they are rugged and scrubby
generally, and covered with heavy timber. There is much quartz rock
here and there to be seen as you pass along, and quartz veins show
themselves frequently on the surface. There are said to be other
indications about of the presence of gold and the inferior metals.
From the summit of them you catch a glimpse of extensive plains and
ranges of mountains in the direction in which you are travelling,
and stretching away to the south and west. That open country is the
commencement of the tract which ends in Yass plains, and the latter
fine country is that through which we have journeyed.</p>

<p>In eleven miles you come to Gungun Creek, on the banks of which
there is a considerable sprinkling of huts and small cultivation
paddocks. Judging from the appearance of the growing crops which we
saw when we passed through, we should say that the soil of this
high country is very good. Besides these evidences of an
agricultural population on the creek, we passed on either side of
the road some small settlers, who had commenced their labours, and
from the abundance about their huts, or homesteads, with the fair
order in which their cattle were in, we concluded that they had
been doing pretty well during the past season. There cannot be said
to be much grass, yet we saw several flocks of sheep, and from time
to time cattle, which we presumed would require more than the
ordinary extent of land allowed for their support, which is
generally calculated at three acres to a sheep.</p>

<p>From Gungun to Winderadeen you leave the main road and travel in
a southerly direction towards Lake George, where the latter-named
place is situated, being the residence of Mr. Murray, a member of
the Legislative Council of New South Wales. The place where you
turn off the great south road is about thirty miles from Goulburn,
at a spot where there are some water-holes, which in rainy weather
soon fill, and then overflow, running across the road. From this
point to Lake George is about twelve miles, over ridges partly very
poor and rugged and partly well grassed. On the former are small
iron-bark and spotted gum trees, on the latter are larger trees of
the description common to good soil in this high region. At one of
Mr. Murray's stations on the Fish River which we crossed, there is
some excellent arable land, showing signs of cultivation, and
general improvement in the way of fencing, with huts conveniently
situated near water, of which there was abundance. Those high
ranges form the western boundary of the beautiful, well-wooded, and
rich mountain valley into which we shortly afterwards entered. The
descent is rather steep, and the view obstructed to the east and
west by high mountain-chains. Up and down the valley, however,
running north and south, the scenery is very fine and picturesque.
In about a mile and a half from the foot of the range, after
passing through some very fine paddocks well enclosed, you at
length come to a complete country gentleman's residence, consisting
of a large stone-built house, with stables, out-houses, garden,
ornamented grounds, &amp;c. This is Winderadeen, the beautiful
country residence of Mr. Murray, adjoining the township of
"Collector," and about three miles from the north end of Lake
George. Every thing about this place has the air of comfort, and
exhibits substantial means on the part of the proprietor; the
fences and such out-offices as are deemed necessary for the present
are all good, and kept in excellent order. The land around the
residence and towards the lake belongs to Mr. Murray. The valley in
which it is situated is of very considerable and varying width; in
some places nearly three miles, in others much less; the soil is
good, and it is unusually well watered by a chain of ponds running
through the middle, alternating with small alluvial flats either
clear of trees, or very thinly studded with gum and apple trees.
Cattle thrive better than sheep upon the strong grasses which grow
in this valley; though there is a considerable portion of the
country fit for sheep at a certain time of the year, which is
stated to be from the first of September to the first of May, when
the grasses will nourish them in such parts where the ground is
sound and free from standing water. Those parts unfit for sheep
have rushes growing upon them, and sometimes even cattle cannot get
at such land. Ascending the steep banks of this valley, you come
into the Breadalbane plains country to the eastward; and pursuing
your way out of it, you come where the so-called lake is, which we
passed over in our journey, and found quite dry and covered with
grass; in fact, there are always flocks of sheep and herds of
cattle depasturing thereon, and they seem to be particularly fond
of the grass it produces which is very nutritious, and contains
some saline matter, which makes it palatable.</p>

<p>In this part of the country snow falls during the winter, as it
does likewise in all the mountain-ranges and table-land throughout
New South Wales, when they are at an elevation of 1500 or 2000 feet
above the level of the sea; and besides the severe frosts which
occur from May to September, there are summer frosts, which
occasionally do damage to the pasture and crops. In consequence of
the comparatively cool temperature of this region to the climate on
the eastern side of the cordillera, it has the advantage of growing
all descriptions of European fruits; while the vine produces as
excellent grapes as the land in the warm valleys below.</p>

<p>Some distance from Winderadeen is the almost abandoned residence
of the original proprietor of this property, the father of the
present possessor. Here are the buildings and stockyard usually to
be found throughout this colony, when there were large
establishments carried on under the assignment system. How very
much changed are all such places now! You seldom see any thing
doing that indicates activity about them; where there were from
twenty to thirty men at work, there are not more than two or three
seen in these times. The result is, that there is the reverse of
that which indicates progress&mdash;ruined buildings, fences out of
order, &amp;c. The strength of the present proprietor seems, in
this instance, to concentrate itself about the upper part of the
estate around his new abode.</p>

<p>Mr. Murray in the night received an express from his other
residence at Yarra Lumla, about thirty-six miles distant, on the
Limestone plains, to visit his family, who were residing there,
without delay; and as we were desirous of seeing that part of the
country, we accepted the hospitable invitation of that gentleman to
follow him thither in his carriage. The road, for the first twelve
miles after leaving the valley, skirts the western side of the
lake, when you keep along the road to the right, through what is
called the "Gap," and ascend the range by which the lake is bounded
to the west. We had heard so much of Lake George, and seen its
extent on the map&mdash;to which we refer the reader&mdash;that we
had made up our minds to see at length a fine sheet of water in
Australia. We were not a little surprised, therefore, and somewhat
disappointed, to find that Lake George was in reality nothing more
than an extensive plain some twenty miles long by an average of
about six miles wide. As far as the eye can reach you see nothing
but a level plain; not a rise, not a tree, nor an object of any
height to interrupt the view, with the exception of cattle here and
there in small herds, or scattered over its surface, with a flock
of sheep dotting the plain at intervals, and if you are keen of
sight you may possibly make out a shepherd. The whole of this
space, however, has been known to be covered with water, and the
trees on the outskirts or margin of the lake to have been killed by
submersion. We should imagine that no great depth of water covered
this flat land during that time, except perhaps in some parts where
there is always water, and which you can see upon ascending the
high lands some miles towards its eastern side, when it appears
like the broad reach of a river passing through a vast plain.</p>

<p>This immense basin in the lap of these mountains has no outlet
when it does become filled with water; it is surrounded on all
sides by an amphitheatre of hills and lofty mountain-ranges, some
of which rise almost perpendicularly from the bed of the lake,
others sloping gradually to a considerable height. These latter are
covered with excellent soil, thinly timbered, and are considered
capital grazing land. Between them are many mountain valleys, with
water-courses which drain the large tract of country behind; and
this valley receives the water, it being the lowest level in their
vicinity; and no doubt when an unusually rainy season occurs, it
will again be filled with water and assume the aspect of a lake.
Such a circumstance might be a serious inconvenience, and perhaps
entail great loss to those who feed their flocks and herds thereon;
yet it is evident that it forms a natural reservoir in the hills,
which supplies water to localities which are often-times dry.</p>

<p>The range of mountains which bounds this lake and valley divides
the eastern and western waters, the one shed of waters flowing into
the Pacific Ocean on the east coast, the other being the sources
which feed the Murrumbidgee, and flow to the westward; thus forming
a portion of the great Australian cordillera, which begins at
Wilson Promontory at the extreme south angle of the country, and
extends to Cape York at its northern extremity,&mdash;a distance
little less than 1700 miles. These ranges are generally highest on
the western flank; and though there is pretty good pastoral and
agricultural land close to the lake, yet the back ranges near the
summit are scrubby and poor. The country to the north-east and east
side of the lake and valley is more grassy and very much less
timbered; and in the direction of Goulburn there appears that fine
open forest-land we have already described. Our road lay here along
a tolerably smooth track, which did not incommode the progress of
the carriage so much as we should have found upon most of the
country roads in England.</p>

<p>Before we arrived at the "Gap" we saw a shepherd at the entrance
of a gully, or as it was called "stony-creek," where an out-station
was situated. He was standing near his hut watching his sheep far
away on the plain below, which we did not see until they were
pointed out to us; they could not be distinguished but by a
practised eye, they were such small specs. High wages had not yet
reached this locality; for this man had engaged only a short time
before for six months at the rate of 20<i>l</i>. a-year. In
consequence, however, of a shepherd in the same master's employ
having just left, another flock had been added to his charge, and
his wages were raised accordingly. Still this was not a sufficient
inducement to keep him beyond the time he had engaged for, as he
was determined to try his luck at the diggings. In our conversation
with this shepherd we were struck by his manner and speech, which
was above that of the mere labourer; and his little history, which
he briefly told us, proved that we were not wrong. He said he was
an artist, and had received a good education from his father, who
was a man of good repute at Merton in Surrey. That a year or two
before, he was tempted, by the favourable reports of Port Philip,
to try his fortune there in prosecuting his profession. When he
arrived he found that his talent as an artist was of no value to
him, and his small means became exhausted, when the reality of his
position soon became clear. He did not blame any one but himself
for the step he had taken, only that he had been mistaken as to the
class of men best adapted for the exigencies of a colonial life; he
had learnt a lesson, and he trusted he should profit by it. That
upon the discovery of gold at Bathurst he had started from Port
Philip to walk overland, and try his fortune as a gold-digger;
having reached thus far, his means had failed him, and he was
compelled to defer his intention until he could realise the
wherewithal to make another start by acting in the capacity of a
shepherd, as he was then employed. The experiences of this young
man are by no means singular throughout these colonies; and there
have been many hundreds with better prospects at starting compelled
through necessity to labour at the ordinary occupations of the
colony; and many have by the sweat of their brow worked out their
independence, when probably they would have remained poor educated
men to the end of the chapter. The energy and spirit shown by this
poor fellow makes us indulge in the hope and the wish that he may
be one of the fortunate ones in the end. We asked him to sketch his
"gunya" and the rocky creek of the gully in the background, when he
informed us he had neither pencil nor paper; on a leaf of our
Journal he made the sketch, and well executed it is. Before leaving
that part of the country we made a request that his wish to have
some paper and pencils might be gratified.</p>

<p>We had still upwards of twenty-four miles of our journey to
accomplish, and the day was far spent, so we urged the driver to
push on as much as possible before night set in. Limestone plains,
towards which we were proceeding, will be seen on the map to lie
south-west of Lake George. Our road lay over some rough
forest-country, with open glades at intervals, as at Mr. Guise's
farm at Bywong, and "Jerry Biggery's flat," where there are small
water-courses, with the land upon their banks under cultivation. As
we approached within a few miles of our destination, we crossed the
Canbury plain, some six or eight miles long by a mile and a half
wide. On the road we passed many small dwellings, and we guessed
that there must be a considerable population about, although we met
but few people. We were told that many of the men had gone on to
the Gunderoo ranges near Bywong and towards Yass, where there were
people at work for gold. In and near Gunderoo Creek, where we
crossed, there were the usual indications of the precious metal.
The only men we saw about were shepherds and stock-keepers, who
were mostly owners of the cattle and sheep they were tending; the
men having very generally abandoned their old labour for a more
profitable occupation.</p>

<p>As the sun was setting, he cast his beams over a picturesque and
extensive country before us. In front was the "Black mountain," and
to the left, sloping hills less elevated, which were covered with
dark forests, that showed the ruby tints of an Australian sunset,
in fine contrast with their gloomy shades. To the right were the
Canbury plains, quite free from trees, bounded on the south by the
Cooleman or Cullatine mountains, where Mr. Murray has another
station, and in the far distance appeared the Brindha Bella
mountains. At the entrance to the plain on the left between these
high lands is the township or village of Canbury, with its little
church, sufficiently large to accommodate the scattered population
hereabouts. Night had closed in upon us, and we were disappointed
by being deprived of a nearer view of the country which suddenly
opens upon emerging from the forest as you descend a ridge which
bounds Canbury plain on that side. Fortunately the coachman knew
the country well, or we might have missed the proper road in the
darkness. As it was, he had great difficulty in finding his way
through by-paths, with slip panels in their fences, belonging to
paddocks on the grounds of Mr. Jeffereys and Mr. Macpherson under
the Black mountain. We also had some difficulty in crossing the
River Queanbeyan or Molonglo River, one of the tributary streams of
the Murrumbidgee, which, though high, was fortunately at this time
not dangerous to cross. At length, after overcoming all these
difficulties in the darkness of the night, we reached our
destination at Yarra Lumla in safety by eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Crossing these rivers when they are swollen is frequently
attended with danger. The little community in and around Canbury,
not very long before we visited that place, had a gloom cast over
it by the untimely death of the Rev. George Gregory, minister of
the little church of St. John's, just mentioned, who was drowned
while attempting to swim across this river. The reverend gentleman,
besides officiating two Sundays in each month at Canbury, devoted
one Sunday to the pastoral charge at Gunderoo&mdash;about twenty
miles from his parsonage; and one Sunday to a congregation of the
squatters scattered over the land on the other side of the
Murrumbidgee, who but for his visits would have been deprived of
the ordinances of the Church. During his absence from home in the
pursuit of his duties, the rivers in this quarter had risen
considerably above their usual height. Having crossed some smaller
streams on his return, he resolved upon attempting the Queanbeyan,
especially as he considered himself a good swimmer. After calling
at the residence of Mr. Mowle, where he dined, he expressed to that
gentleman his determination to cross over to the parsonage, which
is on the opposite bank of the river to where he was. The current
was so strong that Mr. Mowle and another gentleman urged him
strongly not to make the attempt. Mr. Gregory, however, persisted,
remarking, that he had been five days from home, and must return to
his books. The unfortunate gentleman seemed so confident in his
ability to swim across, that his friends relinquished their
opposition, and he, after taking off his coat and boots, sprang
into the river with a smile. The force of the current hurried him
down the stream; but at first he did not seem alarmed, and called
out to Mr. Mowle, "All's right." Almost immediately afterwards he
suddenly sank, and never appeared above the water, until his body
was found lower down the stream. As the water at the time was
extremely cold, it is conjectured that he was seized with cramp,
and his energies became paralysed. Mr. Gregory had resided in that
locality about sixteen months, and was very popular. He appears to
have been a most exemplary man; his kindness of heart and amiable
temper, his zeal in discharge of his sacred duties, especially in
visiting his parishioners, and his eloquence in the pulpit, had
endeared him to all classes; and his death is regarded as an almost
irreparable loss.</p>

<p>We have been induced to give this account of the fate of Mr.
Gregory, as it shows the dangers which often beset clergymen in the
performance of their duties in the interior of Australia. Indeed
the labour of clergymen of all denominations is very great in that
thinly-peopled country, and their attention to their sacred duties
in most instances is beyond all praise; and it is the hope of every
good colonist that sectarian differences will not be indulged in
amongst them, to the damage of religion, and to the destruction or
injury of that feeling of equanimity which prevails. Some men, who
call themselves ministers of the gospel, and take advantage of
their position to rouse the people into rebellion, by entering into
fierce political contests with the government and the colonists,
appear to us to have mistaken their duty and their office, which is
that of preachers of good-will and charity towards all men.</p>

<p>The house at Yarra Lumla is a large and commodious residence,
with suitable offices and grounds for the abode of a country
gentleman. It is well situated above the river just named, and
commands a fine view of the undulating country in the vicinity of
Limestone plains, bordered by distant hills clothed with dense
foliage. Down the valley, which runs in a northerly direction, you
come to the Murrumbidgee again in its tortuous windings, some eight
miles distant as the crow flies, over which country you have an
extensive view, with mountains in the distance, presenting a broken
outline on the horizon, the space between being a level wooded
tract of land. At the back of the house you see the Black mountain
rising on the opposite side of the river, like a giant amongst the
smaller hills which surround the plains. Up the valley there is a
good deal of cultivation, many families having small holdings from
Mr. Murray, the benefit of which he now feels in the scarcity of
labour which has come over the colony. The village of Canbury, with
its pretty little church, is about two miles distant. There is here
not only much that is naturally grand, but man has done his part to
assist nature's beauty, by adding his labours to give life to her
solitudes.</p>

<p>From Yarra Lumla we paid a visit to a brother of our host's. Dr.
Murray, who resides upon his estate called Duntroon, about eight
miles distant, the road passing through Limestone plains. On the
south side, about two miles from the road, is the residence of Mr.
George Campbell, not far from Mount Ainslie, which rises boldly
from the plain. This place is called Byalegy, a native name which
is spelt on the maps Pialago. The rising ground at the back is
thinly timbered, and presents some splendid sheep-walks thickly
covered with grass; and the soil in many parts is stated to be of
the richest description. In due time we arrived at Dr. Murray's
residence called Woden, a very excellent house, built of stone and
brick, and unusually situated upon a hill some distance from water.
Many persons might take exception to the judgment displayed by the
worthy doctor in placing his house in such a position, yet on such
a point we do not think that his taste should be attacked. Some
people, however, like to criticise, and the great mass generally
decide because somebody has said they know not what. Dr. Murray
has, however, pleased himself; and in a splendid situation, in our
opinion, has he placed his residence. The view towards the
Murrumbidgee mountains in front of the house is very extensive, and
presents a prospect seldom surpassed in these regions for wild and
grand scenery. Mount Tennant, distinguishable from the others in
the range, is called after a bush-ranger of that name, who, in days
when such things happened, took up his abode in the deep recesses
of these mountains. Below the house is a rich and very considerable
valley, well watered, with enclosed ground and plenty of stock
feeding about. Behind the house rises a high hill, which appears
the extreme verge of a spur from the mountain-chain in the
distance. Every thing about the premises is well arranged, from the
garden in front, well stocked with fruit-trees, to the stabling and
out-offices behind. Altogether the position of this residence, and
the surrounding scenery, is very beautiful, fine, and pleasing, and
Dr. Murray can well afford the smiles of his friends.</p>

<p>The post-town of Queanbeyan is distant from this place about
four miles, and 170 from Sydney, and is the centre of a district
bearing the same name, having about 2000 inhabitants. On the whole,
we formed a very favourable opinion of this district, and
considered it to be well situated for a large agricultural
population; though we were told that there are in summer
occasionally hot winds, and snow in winter, with severe frosts
often, which are against the crops; otherwise the climate is
pleasant and favourable to health, and all that man could desire.
All around in the severest droughts water has never been known to
fail. In the gardens are to be found all European fruits and
vegetables, and the vine produces abundantly. The pastoral lands
are very excellent; and throughout New South Wales we have not seen
cattle, sheep, and horses in better condition than hereabouts. And
we are certain that this upland district is peculiarly capable of
supporting a large population. At Janefield, the property of the
late Dr. Wilson, we were struck particularly with the rich
appearance of the land; the little cultivation upon it promised to
yield an abundant crop. This district is said to be exposed from
its high altitude to heavy storms; we should say, however, from the
appearance of the trees, which looked well and unscathed when we
passed through, that these storms are not common. The height of the
land generally may be considered at upwards of 2000 feet above the
level of the sea, several of the mountains being above 3500 feet.
There has not been any gold found in this quarter as yet; but we
are strongly impressed with the idea that it will prove as rich in
mineral wealth as the neighbouring counties nearer the sea-coast,
for there is a great similarity about the formation here to that
seen in the vicinity of the Braidwood and Araluen gold-fields, to
which we will direct the reader's attention shortly. During our
journey through this interesting district we frequently conversed
with the smaller class of settlers upon the leasing and purchasing
of land, and we every where found a great desire among the people
to become possessed of land upon which they could establish
themselves permanently. We are confident that until a system is
established of disposing of the waste lands in Australia in small
lots, so as to suit the working population of the country, there
will always be an unsettled feeling amongst the inhabitants. Once
let the industrious family-man have a farm and a house he can call
his own, and all the attractions of the gold-fields will not induce
him to wander about, as many are now doing, like Arabs and gipsies,
from one spot to another. We are happy to state that there appears
every disposition on the part of the local government to favour
this laudable wish.</p>

<p>On the following day we took leave of our hospitable entertainer
and returned to Winderadeen, The day was unusually sultry and wet,
and what with the heat, rain, and flies, we were glad to get to the
end of our journey. On the way we observed that the lands on the
eastern side of Lake George were not so hilly as the western side,
and in every respect we found it a better country. We noticed also
several homesteads of settlers with many hundreds of cattle and
horses depasturing, and occasionally a flock of sheep. At the
southern end of the lake is Currandoula, the joint estate of Sir
Charles Nicholson, the speaker of the Legislative Council, and Mr.
Lithgow, the auditor-general. This property is near to Bungendore,
a village possessing the advantages of a post, as indeed almost
every place accessible throughout New South Wales has, so that
there is not that isolation from the world in these solitudes which
many people suppose, and the idea of which frightens and alarms
those who would otherwise make the bush their home. In the evening
we arrived safe at Winderadeen completely worn out, and we were
glad to retire to rest early.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. BRAIDWOOD
GOLD-FIELDS.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:2%; font-size:1.1em">Mr. Hargreaves entitled
to all the merit of the gold-discovery&mdash;Road from Winderadeen
to Braidwood&mdash;Town of Braidwood&mdash;Farringdon, the estate
of Sir Charles Nicholson&mdash;Nithsdale, and its proprietor Mr.
Wallace&mdash;Dr. Wallace&mdash;Mr. Badgery's
estate&mdash;Major's-Creek diggings&mdash;Gold mines on private

Faithful's estate&mdash;Completeness of the
establishment&mdash;Town of Goulburn&mdash;Deserted by its male
population&mdash;Browne's return from the diggings.</p>

<p>When the discovery of gold in Australia was publicly announced
by Mr. Hargreaves&mdash;with whose name we shall always couple the
merit of demonstrating this great fact to the world,
notwithstanding the claims of scientific men for the honour, for we
consider him the practical man who pointed out the way to the
gold-fields,&mdash;when this gentleman first published the names of
the various localities where he had been successful in finding
gold, many intelligent settlers in other parts of the colony
ascertained the nature and description of the rocks occurring in
the vicinity of the deposits, and immediately set to work in their
own localities to search for the hidden treasure, instead of
flocking with the multitude to the Bathurst mountains, concluding
wisely that these comprised only a small section of the great
mountain-chain where it existed. Like the industrious tenants of an
Australian ant-hill suddenly roused, the whole community of bushmen
became alive amongst the rocks and valleys of the colony.
Stock-whips and shepherds' crooks were thrown aside for pickaxes
and shovels, with which adventurous men might be seen exploring the
gold region, and with what success is now well known to the world.
Amongst other localities which have not only equalled but surpassed
in richness the original gold-field at Summer-hill Creek, those of
Braidwood and Araluen are not the least productive; and as we were
at this stage of our journey within a short distance of them, we
resolved upon paying them a visit.</p>

<p>The distance from Mr. Murray's residence at Winderadeen to the
town of Braidwood is about thirty-six miles. For two-thirds of the
way the country may be described as hilly, with rocks jutting out
occasionally, intersected by veins of mineral quartz and
iron-stone; and here and there you meet with granite boulders.
These hills are thinly timbered by gum and iron-bark trees, with
here and there belts of dense brushwood, alternating with some fair
land for sheep-walks; and half-way on the road, at Mr. Hyland's, of
the "Long swamp," a considerable extent of good land free from
trees, well-grassed, and finely-watered. The homestead at this
station is that of a substantial farmer. Further on you come to
Amprior, the estate of Mr. Ryrie in the county of Murray, on the
Shoalhaven River, about 152 miles from Sydney. Here there is a
considerable quantity of land enclosed, but the property is not
highly esteemed; gold has been found upon it, however; and we
sincerely hope that it will ultimately be of great value to its
possessors. From this spot the remaining twelve miles of the road
is through a good open forest country, which must soon become
valuable land, as there seems now to be no doubt but that the
country within the vicinity of Braidwood is exceedingly rich in
mineral wealth, and that therefore the population which continues
flocking to it from remote districts will create a large town in
time; and this rich country in arable land and pasture, as well as
in the precious metals, must become densely peopled.</p>

<p>As the discovery of gold draws the population away from
districts and towns where it is not found, to those localities
where it abounds in large quantities, towns will spring up in
favourable situations among those mountain districts, which, unless
such a discovery had been made, would have taken years, perhaps
generations, to attract a numerous population to their
out-of-the-way situations. Braidwood is one of those spots,
situated among the mountain-ranges of the great cordillera some
2000 feet above the level of the sea, to which multitudes of people
from the low countries have resorted in pursuit of the one great
object&mdash;gold! It is finely situated on Mankitee Creek, under
the mountain Jillamatong, within the county of St. Vincent, a
hundred and sixty-four miles from Sydney, Before the gold-discovery
it contained about fifty houses, and three hundred inhabitants; now
we should say in its vicinity there may be found as many thousands.
It is only twelve miles from the gold-diggings at Major's Creek,
and something more from those of Bell's Creek and the Araluen
gold-fields. This small village, therefore, was becoming a place of
considerable importance when we passed through it; all was
activity; every one was looking forward with hope; and property in
the neighbourhood was rising in value. Every day brought
intelligence of fresh discoveries, all tending to prove that the
whole district was exceedingly rich in gold, and it was said in
other minerals also. So, what with the beauty and fertility of the
surrounding country, and the rich mineral treasures to be found,
there seems to be little doubt but that the prosperity of this
quarter will be permanent.</p>

<p>Before visiting any portion of the gold-fields, we proceeded
through Braidwood to Mr. Wallace's of Nithsdale, situated on the
right bank of the Shoalhaven River, sixteen miles distant. This
river divides the counties of Murray, Argyle, and Camden from St.
Vincent, taking its rise in the district of Maneroo, from whence it
flows in a northerly direction parallel with the coast, until it
passes through one of the Shoalhaven gullies, where it flows into
the sea at Coolangatta, about a hundred miles from Sydney. The road
we were directed to take was little better than a rough bush-track,
of which there were many intersecting and branching from each other
at the outskirts of the town, rendering it difficult for a stranger
to follow the right path; and so it happened; we had not proceeded
far when we found that we had taken the wrong one. As it turned
out, we were not at all disappointed at our mistake; for we had
thereby an opportunity of passing through Farringdon, a fine
property on the left bank of the river, belonging to Sir Charles
Nicholson, the Speaker of the Legislative Council, situated at the
foot of Mount Ebrington,&mdash;a magnificent object in the
landscape seen from the spot where you ford the river. This is a
large, and will become an exceedingly valuable estate, not only
from the abundance and richness of the alluvial land it possesses
for agricultural purposes, but from the extent of its grazing-land
for cattle; and it would appear, from what we heard, that the
mineral wealth of the country extended to the mountain-ranges near
it. There are considerable improvements already going on within its
boundaries, and much greater are in progress. In a happily-chosen
spot at the entrance of a valley or gully leading into the
highlands is a grassy knoll commanding an extensive view of the
valley and the broad flats on the banks of the river; upon this
knoll a residence is being built, and, when finished, this spot, in
the course of time, will become one among the choice places in New
South Wales that will attract the stranger.</p>

<p>From Sir Charles Nicholson's to Mr Wallace's, at Nithsdale, on
the opposite or east bank of the Shoalhaven River, is about five
miles, the road passing through rich grassy land until you again
ford the river, where it is a clear running stream, and then in a
couple of miles more you arrive at Nithsdale. Mr. Wallace was in
his shearing-shed, superintending his shearers, when we arrived;
the operations of sheep-shearing, washing, and wool-sorting
requiring the attendance of the proprietor, if he expects to have
them well done. Nithsdale, though not so picturesque a place as
Farringdon, is well situated; and it has also the advantage of
commanding a view of Mount Ebrington and a range of mountains, at
the back of which are the Maneroo plains. This residence is built
in the cottage style, with the back of it towards the river, having
in front one of the finest gardens in the colony, regularly planned
out by one evidently skilled in horticulture, and possessing every
kind of European fruit, besides a few from warmer regions. At this
altitude, although in latitude 35°, the climate is cool, enabling
the proprietor to grow currants and gooseberries; at the same time,
it is exposed to summer frosts, in common with all these mountain
ranges, even as far north as the tropics of Australia. Mr. Wallace
is well known throughout the colony for his kindness and
hospitality to strangers; and we had another opportunity, at his
delightful residence, of seeing a colonist fully employed upon his
estate in the multiplicity of occupations which an Australian
settler has to attend to, although in these times they are very
much interfered with. He was about building a more substantial
residence than the one he had hitherto occupied. This is the usual
course of successful men in Australia: they commence with a little,
and, backed by industry and perseverance, they prosper; as soon as
they have taken firm root in the country, and can spare the means,
they then erect habitations in the wilderness they have reclaimed,
which, as we have already stated, would be creditable in any part
of England for the residences of country gentlemen or substantial
farmers. A stop, however, was put to Mr. Wallace's intentions for
the present, from the scarcity of workmen and the high wages
demanded. The change brought about by the gold-discovery in this
respect had made it unwise for the time to enter upon any building
project or other improvement that required the labour of many
hands; consequently the means he had provided and laid apart for
the purpose of erecting a permanent dwelling were likely to be
employed in speculating in gold. Men must go along with the general
movement thus, no matter in what sphere of life they move, or they
and their families will not keep their places in the social scale.
It is all very well to say that "Jack is as good as his master" in
the scramble for gold; in one sense he has always been so, and will
be so as long as each depends upon his bodily strength and luck at
the diggings; but in the race for fortune, which has now begun
under a new phase in this new country, the same faculties that
raised most of the leading men to their present position will carry
them on foremost in the race. And as it would appear that the great
mass of mankind are destined to be hewers of wood and drawers of
water, after a short time matters in these gold regions will go on
much as usual; men will find their places in the community best
suited to them for the benefit of all classes of society.</p>

<p>We met here a brother of our host's. Dr. Wallace, well known
throughout all circles of Sydney society as the most attentive and
amiable practitioner in the city. Alas! poor man, he was suffering
in the last stage of consumption, with no hope before him; and
since then he has been relieved from his earthly troubles. He was a
most agreeable and superior man; and though one felt sad at
beholding the wreck of such a noble vessel in the prime of life,
yet the resignation with which he bore his fate commanded our
respect in the highest degree, and was a lesson to us to bear with
fortitude the ills to which our nature is subject.</p>

<p>On the following morning we left the hospitable dwelling of Mr.
Wallace; and his poor sick brother most kindly showed us part of
the way to Major's-Creek diggings, distant from Braidwood about
twelve miles. We pursued the path round the side of Mount
Ebrington, and managed again to take the wrong track, which led us
to the side of a rocky range, separating the waters that fall into
the Shoalhaven River from those that flow into Major's Creek.
However, we gained the right path, after catching a view of Mount
Ebrington, which served as a guide, by which we threaded our way
through brushwood, crossing ridges of rough and barren hills, until
we emerged from a forest upon some enclosures on cleared ground. We
had now reached the property of Mr. Badgery, the proprietor of the
Major's-Creek gold-fields, which are two miles distant from his
residence. Following a well-beaten road from Braidwood, we kept
along the fences of Mr. Badgery's cultivated land, and in due time
came to where there were said to be nearly 900 persons at work in
and around the creek. Every one was said to have been successful,
more or less, in finding gold, and some were realising large sums
of money. At Major's Creek the land is particularly good, and the
country around is a very fine open forest, with plenty of grass of
the best description, possessing fattening properties; in proof of
which we may mention, that the finest fat cattle which used to
arrive in the Sydney market were sent from this property. Alas for
the Sydney people! unless matters change greatly, it will be some
time before they will receive any more of them. There is now
collecting a multitude of people on the spot, who will soon consume
the produce of this and many other estates in the neighbourhood, at
prices remunerative to the stockholder, without the expense
attendant upon driving the animals such a distance to market.</p>

<p>The trees about Major's Creek are the white-gum and woolly-butt,
with some stringy-bark upon the back-land. The rocks are chiefly
granitic, and the soil at the banks of the creek a dark mould. The
gold is here found in granite in a state of decay or
disintegration; we think that geologists call it at this particular
locality hornblende granite, among which it occurs in finer
particles, and is of a darker hue than that found at the first
discovered spots on the Turon and at Ophir, where the matrix is
quartz. We were somewhat pleased at this fact of gold being found
in granite; for upon our mentioning to one of the learned, during
our travels, that we had seen what appeared to us to be granite
near a rich deposit of gold, we were politely corrected, and
assured that it could not be granite, as gold was never found in
that formation. However, Major's Creek, and the gold-fields about
Braidwood, prove that it is not well to be too confident. Not only
has this locality disproved the assertions of learned pundits in
this respect, but it has completely upset the conclusions that a
gold country must necessarily be an infertile country; for here the
land is very excellent for cultivation immediately above the gold
alluvium. Altogether the Major's-Creek discovery has puzzled those
who assume to know more than others do about the hidden treasures
of Australia, and of nature generally.</p>

<p>At this spot "the diggings" are upon private property; and the
profit to the proprietor of the land is half the monthly license of
30<i>s</i>. from each person at work. We have mentioned that the
fortunate possessor of this estate is Mr. Badgery; who, besides
receiving this ample income from his land, realises large profits
by supplying the diggers with butcher's meat and all sorts of
necessaries from his store. In this he is assisted by Mrs. Badgery;
a tidy, clever, bustling little woman, who, though probably never
before accustomed to such an occupation, was, under the
circumstances, quite equal to the task; in fact, what a wife should
be, particularly in this young community&mdash;a helpmate to her
husband. We heard an opinion of her, expressed loudly to himself,
from a huge fellow who was leaning his heavy shoulders against the
door-post, and watching her. "Ah!" said he, "that's what I call a
<i>nugget</i> of a wife." Now, such of our readers as may not know
what a "nugget" is, we beg to inform them that it is a smooth,
water-worn piece of shining gold, varying from the size of a pea to
a large turnip, and what the Californian and Australian
gold-diggers consider the most satisfactory thing imaginable to
possess. To liken Mrs. Badgery to a "nugget," therefore, was in his
mind the greatest compliment he could possibly pay her.</p>

<p>Bell's Creek diggings are situated below Major's Creek, and
farther down you come to those at Araluen River; the two former
creeks may be considered the sources of the latter stream, which is
a tributary of the Deua River, and forms a branch of the Moruya
River, which flows into the sea 190 miles south of Sydney, in the
vicinity of Broulee. These auriferous streams intersect the
table-land around Braidwood; and for several miles below the
junction of Bell's Creek with the Araluen the rocks are mostly
granite. Below that again we were informed that there is a great
deal of clay slate. The altitude of these deposits is not less than
1500 feet above the level of the sea, although scarcely a degree of
longitude from the coast. The country in many places has a most
park-like appearance, particularly at Araluen Vale, where all
concur in describing the scenery as very fine and beautiful. Time
did not admit of our going through these localities, in which large
bodies of people were at work. We were informed that precious
stones had been found amongst the gold, which were then in the
possession of a jeweller in Sydney. Certainly this gold-finding,
with such discoveries added to it, has become a most exciting
employment. In the fortunes which turn up to some, it becomes a
species of gambling, and the feeling which prompts the many to
encounter the task is the same that moves the gambler. But there is
this difference: the gambler, in addition to the love of gold,
conducts his labours under the influence of the worst passions of
our nature, and is often tempted to commit frauds upon his
fellow-creatures; whereas the gold-digger earns even his prize
nuggets by the sweat of his brow. This is a very important
difference, as it seems to us; and it is our hope that the result
to the fortunes of the two classes will be as great.</p>

<p>We returned to Braidwood, and journeyed from thence to Arnprior,
where we met a minister of the Scottish church, a Mr. Ross, who was
on his way to the diggings, attracted by a sense of duty for the
good of others. From Arnprior we started for Springfield, the
estate of William Pitt Faithful, a distance of thirty-four miles,
passing Boro on the way. The road goes through a very poor and
scrubby country as far as the latter place, some sixteen miles
distant. There is but one spot, about half-way in a valley, where
there was any land worth attention; and as some persevering settler
had built a neat house upon it, with some improvements, we inferred
that there was some better land away from the track than that
through which we passed. Before you come to Boro, which is merely a
public-house, there is a little tolerably good pasture-land, near a
creek, which at this time of the year is a chain of ponds. We saw
some sheep feeding about in good order. In a few miles after
leaving Boro, the aspect of the country improves greatly, and as
you approach Springfield it becomes very fine. This place is within
twelve miles of Goulburn, and probably it may challenge New South
Wales for order, and, as far as we could perceive, good management.
The name is most appropriate, and there are few places that will
bear comparison with it. It possesses almost every advantage in
position, climate, in the lay of the land, and the richness of the
soil; and what is beyond all price, we were informed that in the
severest droughts there was always plenty of water. Nature here has
left but little for man to do; the ground is in large open spaces
ready for the plough, with grass of the finest description upon it
for the support of cattle.</p>

<p>Mr. Faithful, who was the first colonist to tread its
greensward, at once fixed upon it for his future residence. The
house and premises are situated upon a rising ground towards one
side of a circle formed by hills, more or less distant. The higher
hills are densely wooded, and look dark in the landscape; but the
lower ones are only thinly timbered with the low-flooded gum, which
affords ample shade. Upon the wide open flat around there are many
clumps of trees, clear from underwood, while the ground is thickly
covered with grass. Though surrounded by hills, the view is not
confined, for over these wooded undulations you see other hills
beyond, and again high mountains in the far distance, in some
places finely broken in the outline. The different shades
occasioned by this variety of distance produce a very beautiful
effect. Through one of these undulations the house is seen from the
road. The diameter of what may be called the inner circle we should
calculate to be about four miles. How large the whole estate is we
do not know; judging from the number of sheep upon it, it must be
very extensive, and valuable from the quality of the land. All the
grazing and agricultural paddocks around the homestead are well
fenced in, and every part about it has so much the appearance of
comfort and order that we could imagine ourselves upon some
well-managed large farm in England. The stables, the barns, and all
the other buildings suitable for a farm of this magnitude, are most
substantial. The garden is perfect of its kind; there are
fruit-trees of every sort that will stand the climate, such as the
peach, nectarine, loquat, apple, and the pear, with a beautiful
show of flowers. Here we saw three siloes for storing grain, such
as were constructed by the Egyptians to prepare for a dearth of
corn in the land, which has often occurred in New South Wales, and
may happen again during a long-continued drought. They are deep
wells cut in the solid rock, hermetically sealed, and shaped like a
seltzer-water bottle inside. One of them contained 1500 bushels of
wheat. The place they were in was well chosen, and they were built
in a workmanlike manner. Mr. Faithful said they answer the purpose
admirably. It was impossible not to be struck with the difference
in the appearance of such estates as this where the proprietor is
resident, from those where he is not&mdash;the latter belonging to
Sydney merchants, and the former possessed by <i>bonâ-fide</i>
settlers. The dwelling-house on this estate is built in the cottage
style, having been added to from time to time; it is the original
house, and looks as if it had done its work; and the time has
arrived for another to replace it, which we saw already being
commenced. Perhaps, however, like all prudent men, its excellent
proprietor will be in no hurry to continue operations in the
present state of the labour-market.</p>

<p>Leaving this beautiful residence, we once more pursued our way
towards the main road, in the direction of Goulburn. The distance
from Springfield to this town is twelve miles, over open plains,
with the exception of a few trees on the higher parts of them to
the left of the road; they were well grassed, and plenty of water
on them. But again we were informed that this was a most favourable
season; that often water was not to be procured upon them, and
sometimes there was not a blade of grass. These plains are known as
the Goulburn plains, called by the aborigines Mulwarree: they
contain from 25 to 30,000 acres of land clear of trees. Through
them runs the Mulwarree and Wollondilly rivers, at the junction of
which, nearly in the midst of these plains, is situated the town of
Goulburn, 125 miles from Sydney. Before the gold-discovery it
contained nearly 1400 inhabitants. It possesses upwards of 250
houses, of which 140 are built of stone and brick. Some of the
public buildings would be ornamental in the largest cities of these
colonies; and the hotels and shops are equally elegant. It has
postal communication with Sydney four days in the week. Once a week
there is published in it a very creditable newspaper, called the
<i>Goulburn Herald</i>. It is the town of most importance in the
district of the same name, which embraces the southern portion of
the county of Georgiana, and the whole of the county of Argyle, a
police district which contained upwards of 6000 inhabitants before
the gold-discovery. Now, however, most of the men have left; and
one of the questions which interest the people of Goulburn is, the
effect this wonderful discovery will have upon their town, which
had risen to a state of great prosperity entirely through the
industry of the colony and the wealth of its flocks and herds. Its
sprightly little newspaper thus consoles its readers:</p>

<p class="newspaper">The once busy, bustling town of Goulburn is
now reduced to a heretofore unknown state of quietude. Shops are
lacking customers, some are closed; men are scarce; husbands have
left their wives and families; servants have quitted their
employment; in short, nearly all who could go have packed up and
are off for the diggings around Braidwood. Success has crowned the
labours of nearly all who have quitted Goulburn for the gold
regions in the neighbourhood. While we can deeply sympathise with
the poor, bereaved, unhappy wives, and lament the apparent
desertion of the male population, we can pleasantly console
ourselves with the idea, that the ebb of its inhabitants will be
succeeded by a flood of wealth and prosperity which those who have
left it will bring back with them to their homes and families; but
the present deserted condition of the town will not only be
interrupted by the return of those who belong to it, but by
thousands of others who will necessarily repair there as the
general rendezvous of the southern diggings. We anticipate much.
The good times are coming.</p>

<p>Whether these prospects will be realised for this pleasant
little town or not, time will show; we wish the enterprising people
of Goulburn all success. In order to give the reader some idea of
the literature at this inland town, we quote the following racy
sketch, illustrative of the times, from the same local journal.</p>

<p class="newspaper">The time passed so wearily whilst Browne was
at the diggings. The morning was dull, the day was dull, and there
was no comfort until the candles were lighted, after dark, when
Mrs. Browne divided her sorrows with Mrs. Jones, who imparted hers
in return, and so both felt mutually miserable, and much relieved
thereby. There is a consolation to some minds in seeing others
miserable. Poor Mary! she was getting heart-sick, and had formed a
desperate resolve to go to the diggings herself, and bring back
Browne, as she said, in spite of the commissioner and all the
police; a resolution that Mrs. Jones highly applauded, and after
taking a slight refreshment, hinted the possibility of getting back
Jones by the same means; and by way of showing their earnestness,
they agreed to take a cold fowl and ham with them, and book their
places in the Red Rover for the diggings.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Jones went home full of this stern resolve, and Mary declared,
with tears in her eyes, that she would die&mdash;that she
would&mdash;or succeed in her attempt; for what was life and
gold-dust without Browne?<br>
<br>
Sorrow and sleep bowed down Mary's eyelids. She had put her hair in
paper for the night, and was tying the strings of her night-cap,
when the sound of a horse stopping at the door made her listen
earnestly.<br>
<br>
"Wo!" said the voice outside.<br>
<br>
"Goodness gracious!" said Mary.<br>
<br>
"Softly&mdash;wo, old girl! Quietly does it!"<br>
<br>
"It is Browne himself!"<br>
<br>
How changed he was, to be sure! He was overrun with hair, which had
spread over his face like weeds over neglected land, the promontory
of his nose being only visible through the scrubs which, from his
lips downwards to his chin, were impervious. No Leichhardt razor
had penetrated there; it was all "Mallee." His skin was bronzed,
and his hands were hardened by continuous toil. But he was the
master of 100 ounces of Ballarat gold, which made his fustian
trousers quite picturesque, his blue shirt a manly garb, and his
battered straw hat more sightly than a beaver. Browne was
successful&mdash;and success is a test of merit.<br>
<br>
Who but a wife can appreciate the joy experienced on the return of
a husband after a long absence, especially if that absence has been
passed at the diggings successfully? Mrs. Browne cried, then
laughed, and cried again, as Browne made his appearance. She was
delirious with joy, as she clasped Browne in her arms, and called
him her 'nugget.' She poured out endearments by troy weight, and
regarded Browne as a 'specimen' not to be parted with even at
3<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. per ounce. He was above standard
value. True, her protestations may have had a dash of the
auriferous in them; but what has not at the present
moment?&mdash;and Mrs. Browne is but mortal.<br>
<br>
"You've been away a long time," said Mary.<br>
<br>
"My word, you may say that," replied Browne; "and to some purpose
too. What do you think of Geelong, now? Like to go home to your
mother, eh?"<br>
<br>
"Now, Browne, don't; I'm so glad you've come back."<br>
<br>
"Back before I intended, Mary, glad as I am to see you; and much
better off than I thought I should be when I started for Buninyong,
on what you called a cock-and-a-bull errand."<br>
<br>
"I never did, Browne. I never used such an improper expression; and
if I did, which I didn't, it should not be repeated now. By the by,
what do you think, Browne? Mrs. Jones says that Mr. Jones will give
all his gold to her."<br>
<br>
"Will he?" remarked Browne, briefly.<br>
<br>
"Why, of course he will, Browne. Who else should he give it to but
to his wife?"<br>
<br>
"Ah! to whom indeed?" said Brown. "Better than throwing it away, or
spending it in nobblers, and getting into the station-house, and
being fined next morning!"<br>
<br>
"How you do go on, Browne!" retorted Mary.<br>
<br>
"True," said Browne, "a choice of evils. The foolishness of the
wife against the folly of the husband. Equal weight, balanced by
Commissioner Chance and Commissioner Appetite, and turned by
Accident."<br>
<br>
"What a fright you do look, Browne!" said Mary, turning the
conversation. "No wonder they made you pay license, and refused to
be responsible for you by escort. The governor was quite right to
issue a proclamation against such things; and a hole eight feet
square is quite enough for men with such beards as you've got,
Browne. You look like an underground animal&mdash;a mole."<br>
<br>
"I'm sleepy, Mary, and tired from a long ride&mdash;sixty miles.
Ha!"<br>
<br>
"To see me, my dear,&mdash;your wife,&mdash;your own Mary. Come,
tell me all about it, whilst supper is getting ready.&mdash;Well,
he's gone to sleep."<br>
<br>
Browne was snoring, and muttering of holes, cradles, tin dishes,
creeks, and water-holes; and suddenly starting up, captured his own
wife by the wrist, and declared he would walk her before the
Commissioner.<br>
<br>
"I was only putting it in the tea-caddy, Browne."<br>
<br>
"Putting what in the tea-caddy?" said Browne.<br>
<br>
"Why, this little leathern bag, to be sure, that you had in your
side-pocket. There now, Browne," said Mary, putting her little hand
on his mouth&mdash;"it's no use talking; I want lots of little
things&mdash;so sit down to supper, and tell me all about the
diggings."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. JOURNEY FROM
GOULBURN TO SYDNEY.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:2%; font-size:1.1em">Proposed railway from
Sydney to Goulburn&mdash;Advanced state of the farms around
Goulburn&mdash;Deserted appearance of old estates&mdash;Estate of
Arthurslee&mdash;Inn at the Cross-roads&mdash;Vine Lodge&mdash;Mr.
Nicholson's farm&mdash;The village of Bong-Bong&mdash;A family

Cove&mdash;Population of Sydney&mdash;Churches, colleges, and

<p>Few countries of equal extent are naturally better adapted for
railways than Australia: its extensive plains, its undulating
prairie-land, even its mountain-chains, with their unbroken ridges,
are admirably suited for these iron roads; and when we consider
that there are so few navigable rivers&mdash;-those natural
highways&mdash;to open up the resources of the interior, this mode
of communication with the coast will prove doubly advantageous to
the colonists. The greatest obstacle to overcome on the territory
of the south-eastern section, over which we have been travelling,
will be to cross the great dividing range, so as to connect the
eastern with the southern settlements, and bring the produce of the
western rivers to the out-ports on the coast. The subject has been
one of serious consideration among the colonists of New South Wales
for many years back, and several schemes have been proposed where
to lay down the first railroad, and how to raise the capital
necessary for such an undertaking. The most feasible plan was that
of a line from Sydney to Goulburn via Parramatta, a distance of 123
miles, as it would pass through a country rich in pastoral and
agricultural produce; the carriage of which to the colonial
metropolis would pay expenses, independently of the passenger
traffic. For this purpose a preliminary survey was made, and the
gradients on the proposed line presented no great difficulty to
overcome in accomplishing such a work at a moderate outlay of
capital. A company was subsequently formed, and a portion of the
shares were submitted to the English public; but there proved no
inclination on the part of home-capitalists to subscribe, and the
colonial shareholders were not sufficiently numerous to raise the
means for carrying out the project, so the matter has been for some
years in abeyance. Now, in the blush of their golden prosperity, it
is again talked of, and means are likely to be forthcoming both at
home and abroad; but the difficulty they have now to contend with
is the want of labour. We have no hesitation in stating our
conviction, that under good management such a company cannot fail
to afford a profitable investment for capital.</p>

<p>The face of the country about Goulburn, with its hills and dales
and plains, sometimes altogether clear of trees, and at other
places lightly timbered, presenting that scenery so peculiar to
Australia, is certainly exceedingly beautiful. The time and the
particular season that we passed through was, as we have before
remarked, a very favourable one for the pasture-lands, consequently
there was abundance of grass for the numerous flocks in this
district; but in dry seasons, we were informed that there was a
great scarcity of pasture, at which times the stock suffered much.
These plains and the adjacent country, as stated in the preceding
chapter, are watered by the Mulwarree and Wollondilly and their
tributaries, which we beheld running in their course like the clear
brooks of the mother-country. It will be seen, on reference to the
map, that they form the sources of the Hawkesbury River, a stream
which empties itself into the sea fourteen miles north of Sydney,
The farms and estates in the neighbourhood are of the highest
class, and present all those improvements in cultivation and
building which old-established settlers only have the time and
means of introducing and erecting.</p>

<p>After leaving Goulburn for the north, you ascend some hills,
over which the great south road passes from Sydney. From the summit
of these hills there is a fine view of the town of Goulburn and its
environs, situated as it is in the midst of extensive plains,
surrounded by distant high lands. We kept the main road only for
six miles, when we turned off to the left, and pursued our way
along the course of the Wollondilly, which we had to cross several
times on our journey; and for the next twenty-four miles we passed
through a very unsatisfactory country, until we reached the
boundary of the estate of Arthurslee, situated in the county of
Argyle, near Eden Forest, 100 miles from Sydney.</p>

<p>There was a large labouring population at one time amongst these
hills, and then the landholders prospered; where the soil was good
for any thing, considerable improvements had been made in useful
and appropriate buildings for agricultural purposes; but now their
homesteads are lapsing into decay; you can easily distinguish the
difference between these old establishments and the newer ones you
pass on the way. Every thing around gave evidence of our
approaching that part of the colony which had flourished in the
palmy days of the assignment system, and which has decayed since
that system was done away with; and we passed many large
establishments completely deserted and going to destruction: in
every direction buildings, fences, and other works of labour are
going to wreck. And the gold-discovery appears to have completed
the work of ruin; at all events for the present, for the country
seems to have lost all its men; you meet with a few shepherds
certainly, but there is no bustle about the homesteads, and all
improvements have stopped: it seemed to us a deserted region; and
the idea was strengthened as we rode over the pasture-land for the
latter portion of the way, where it looked very barren and
ill-clothed with grass. The cattle we saw grazing likewise appeared
in poor condition; and although the sheep were a little better,
still, from the scantiness of the grass, we should suppose that it
would require double the extent of pasture-land to feed them upon
than is usually allowed in the colony. Under this head we must not
class all the estates in this locality; for the lands that belonged
to Major Lockyer, and one or two others, were much better; but
still the general aspect of the country did not please us.</p>

<p>Arthurslee is an estate of some 18,000 acres, the greater
portion of which is inferior land. There are, however, a few
thousand acres of very excellent soil on the banks of the
Wollondilly, which meanders round part of the estate; if the whole
of the property was equally well grassed as this portion,
Arthurslee would be one of the most valuable estates in New South
Wales. Crossing the river, we entered this section, and found it a
beautiful open forest country, not too hilly, but undulating, with
a sufficient number of trees for shade and ornament. The flocks we
saw feeding on this land were looking remarkably well, and they are
valued for the fine quality of their fleeces. Though the grasses in
this locality are the best food for fine-woolled sheep, yet they do
not possess those fattening properties which the grasses in the
neighbourhood of Goulburn are prized for. The buildings upon this
estate are not very extensive, the cottage is small, and the whole
premises, with the exception of a large shearing and wool shed, are
in a ruinous state; this will not be regretted, however, by the
future possessor of this property, for the homestead, strange to
say, is not nearer water fit for house use than a mile. One would
have imagined that a convenient supply of water was the first thing
to consider in choosing the site for a residence; but the
proprietor, in this case, like one we have already mentioned, may
have been determined by fancy for the scenery in fixing upon this
spot, neglecting that which is of far greater importance. There are
many beautiful spots on the bank of the river suitable for this
purpose; and the probabilities are that the next possessor will
form his establishment where the stream is more handy. As a
sheep-farm this estate is and will always be of value; at present
it carries from eight to ten thousand sheep, and the rough land
would carry a thousand head of cattle; but for cultivation, judging
from that which is under tillage near to the house, we should say
that the country is not well adapted for it; nor did we see any
much better around.</p>

<p>Continuing our journey from Arthurslee in an easterly direction,
we passed through a most beautiful open sheep country for two
miles, towards the junction of Paddy's River with the Wollondilly;
the latter forming a boundary of the estate. Our route then for
several miles lay through a hilly forest country, very scrubby, and
well known as the Wombat Brush, situated in the county of Camden,
near the Wingecarribee River. After passing through this brush with
its iron-bark trees, the country improved all the way, until we
reached the great south road again, at a spot called the
Cross-roads, where there is a tolerably comfortable roadside inn,
about sixteen miles from Arthurslee. Diverging again from this
point, we visited the property of Mr. Badgery, brother to the owner
of the gold-field at Major's Creek; his residence is called Vine
Lodge, Sutton Forest, and is situated about six miles from the
Cross-roads inn. It need scarcely be said that Mr. Badgery was at
the diggings assisting his brother, and that nearly all the men on
the estate had left with him. Mrs. Badgery, with the women, were
alone upon the farm, all doing their best to keep matters from
falling behind. The property is of considerable extent, well
enclosed, and much of it under cultivation. It is divided into two
farms, the other homestead being named Ivy Hill, and occupied by a
Scotchman, to all appearance a most industrious man. Mr. Badgery
had adopted a plan which, in this upland, heavily-timbered country,
answered well&mdash;he destroyed the trees by "ringing" them; that
is, cutting off a strip of bark round the butt of the tree, which
prevents the sap ascending, and thereby kills them. The result was,
that the finest grass sprung up where the ground became exposed to
the sun and rain, unobstructed by the foliage of the trees. Of
course, it will take some years before this land can be cleared of
the dead timber; but the plan has two advantages&mdash;plenty of
good firewood, and immediate profit from the quantity of stock he
is able to rear on it. All this tract of country is well watered
and wooded with the box, woolley-butt, apple-tree, and occasionally
groves of the wattle-tree, or acacia.</p>

<p>Not many miles from Mr. Badgery's, and within four-miles of
Bong-Bong&mdash;a small township east of the main
road&mdash;resides Mr. Nicholson, who was formerly harbourmaster at
Sydney; he has a most comfortable house, with an excellent garden,
and a good deal of land under cultivation. He is a bluff old
sailor, and gave us a hearty welcome. Excited by the wonderful
discoveries of gold so near to his property, he was determined to
look about his own land for a "digging," and at the time we arrived
he was engaged in sinking a hole with this view. He was not then
successful; nor have we heard whether he has discovered any since.
After partaking of an excellent breakfast we thanked him for his
politeness, and continued our journey.</p>

<p>As you proceed from here towards Bong-Bong, the road is fenced
in on both sides; and occasionally you see tolerably good houses.
On your right, before you enter the village, and some distance off
the road, the dwelling of a successful settler appears finely
situated in the middle of a large cultivated paddock, and
commanding a view of the valley and the village below. Bong-Bong is
a very exposed place, and most uninteresting. It has a small
church, and a number of small houses, with a few people crawling
about, as though they were anxious to follow those already gone to
the gold-fields. Formerly the main road passed near this spot over
the Mittagong range of mountains, to avoid which the new road was
made by Berrima. This road in fine weather, when we crossed the
range, was nearly impassable for heavily-laden drays; and we
calculated that it must be quite so in wet weather. The surrounding
scenery is picturesque; and there seemed to be plenty of grass even
upon the highest part of the land. Descending into the valley you
are agreeably surprised at the appearance of a windmill, with neat
enclosures around it, which gives the country a very pleasing
aspect. As we proceeded onwards, we noticed some small cottages
with enclosed paddocks, that had been abandoned by their tenants
for the gold-fields. In most of those that were inhabited we saw
only women and children. In ten miles after we had left Bong-Bong,
we came to a place called Madigong, belonging to a carrier of the
name of Green, who had settled himself down comfortably upon his
own freehold; and there was every prospect of his doing well. He
had a considerable piece of ground enclosed, which he found to be
rich soil; and he informed us that the country all around, though
subject to severe summer frosts, was very good for stock. The
valley through which we were journeying at this time is bounded by
considerable hills, covered with box and
wattle-trees,&mdash;indications of good soil. In this part of the
territory it is very possible that many families may establish
themselves in small farms, for which this upland country seems well
adapted. Already we heard of successful gold-seekers having
invested in small holdings; and there is little doubt that many
will do the same in other parts of the colony.</p>

<p>From Madigong to the main road is about four miles, through a
forest of box-trees of gigantic dimensions, the ground being
tolerably well covered with grass. The road continued still very
bad; and as it had been abandoned for the new route by Berrima,
some seventeen miles from this point, it is not likely that much
will be done to repair it at the public expense; so that the
settlers must waddle through it, as they did but a very few years
since along the country roads in England.</p>

<p>Within a mile of the point of junction, between the new and old
roads, is Keighran's public-house, where you will find good
entertainment for man and beast. After you get into the new road it
is decidedly better travelling; but the country is still scrubby
and mountainous. Seven miles from Keighran's you arrive at the
Woolpack inn, kept by John Jones, which is a very fair description
of a roadside inn. Here we found every one in a state of great
excitement, in consequence of some news relative to the
gold-diggings in the south, brought down by the mail. Not only
those who had bodily strength to encounter the fatigues of a long
journey and hard work, but many who appeared unfit for the task,
had abandoned their usual occupations. On the road we encountered a
very old man and his wife, and their son, his wife, and child, with
all their worldly goods stowed away in a cart, proceeding cheerily
to the great points of attraction. The old couple said they did not
covet the gold so much for their own sakes, but that it was "a good
chance for Jack; they would work for him, his wife, and the young
un, and for as many more as God would bless them with." We did not
see a party more likely to do well; and they had our best wishes
for their success.</p>

<p>The soil is a little better about Jones's, but far from being
good; it is seldom, indeed, that you find any good land for
agriculture in such a high region. From here the road passes
through a poor hilly country, with scarcely any signs of being
occupied by settlers. And this description of country continues all
the way, until you reach the township of Picton, situated in the
county of Camden, forty-six miles from Sydney, on the Stone-quarry
rivulet. This is a pretty little village in the midst of
picturesque hills, and built upon private property belonging to
Major Antell, who, with Mr. Harper and Mr. Bunker, possess all the
valley and the surrounding hills, estimated to contain about ten
thousand acres of fine land, and very well watered. As may be
imagined, we found this embryo town almost deserted; at the best of
its existence, it did not contain more than one hundred and fifty
inhabitants. Around it we saw some of the finest wheat-fields we
had yet passed on our journey, and we were informed that in no part
of the colony was better grown.</p>

<p>At this beautiful spot we turned from the main-road and struck
off to the left along a by-path amongst the hills leading to
Vanderville, the residence of Mr. John Wild, situated on Werriberri
Creek, seven miles from Picton, and twelve miles from Camden. The
intermediate country is very good, but hilly; and you remark, as
you pass through the valley on leaving Picton, on a part of Mr.
Harper's estate, that the Scotch thistle has been permitted to grow
in places so as to overrun the land, rendering it quite a nuisance
to the agriculturist. Approaching Vanderville you ascend into quite
a mountainous region, where you attain an altitude probably of not
less than 1500 feet above the level of the sea at this spot. The
homestead is beautifully situated in a valley of rich land, through
which run the Werriberri and Waterfall creeks. This is a
cattle-station, where dairy operations are carried on to a great
extent; Mr. Wild milking daily one hundred and five cows, making
from their milk one hundredweight of cheese per day. For a dairy
this farm is admirably situated, being cool, and possessing always
the best of water. The proprietor has eleven children, whom he now
finds the value of; for without his sons the whole property would
have been neglected, and the dairy operations at a stand-still; for
they milk, make cheese, and do all that is requisite and necessary
to be done on a farm of this kind. Through this beautiful valley it
is proposed that the railway from Sydney to Goulburn should be
made. But when? Echo replies, But when?</p>

<p>From Vanderville we proceeded to Brownlow Hill, the seat of A.
McLeay, Esq., son of the late colonial secretary, on the Mount
Hunter rivulet, about six miles from Camden. For eight miles we
passed over a considerable range of hills, called Tuck range. The
road then passes through a valley well cultivated; the crops were
standing, and promised a good harvest. All about this quarter is
very charming. The residence of Mr. McLeay is perfect. It is
situated on a knoll rising out of the level ground on the north
bank of the stream, which has been levelled at the top; and round
greater part a terrace is built, with an ornamental garden on the
slopes around it, displaying flowers of the most gorgeous hues, and
shrubberies of the most tasteful description, in the midst of which
is a large aviary. There are two approaches to the house,&mdash;one
at the back, and one in front, both up an inclined plane through
the shrubbery, very pretty and well kept. Altogether it is a
delightful retreat, and quite the residence of a gentleman
possessing good taste and ample means to display it. The alluvial
flats around the house towards the rivulet are of the richest
mould, and of considerable extent; and the undulating hills behind
are picturesque and park-like. We had hoped to have the good
fortune of finding Mr. McLeay at home, but he was absent; at the
same time he was well represented by his hospitable and amiable
lady.</p>

<p>This part of the country being within such a short distance of
the southern metropolis, it has many advantages in the presence of
a resident gentry. Among them is Mr. Cooper of Wivenhoe, near the
village of Narellan, on the Cow-pasture or Nepean River. From his
residence you command a view of Camden church, about three miles
and a half distant. Here is the commencement of the Cow-pastures,
the valuable estate of Mr. McArthur, one of the oldest colonists.
Our route lay another way; and therefore we missed seeing a
property of which so much has been said. A numerous tenantry on
small holdings abound in and around the neighbourhood; and the
sooner, in this and other localities, such large tracts of land are
divided into reasonable-sized farms, the better it will be for all
parties; for we cannot see how the proprietors are to carry on
their large agricultural establishments in the present altered
state of these colonies. With those properties which can alone be
occupied as sheep or cattle runs it may be different.</p>

<p>From Wivenhoe we proceeded by the Cobbitty-road to Liverpool, a
borough town of New South Wales, situated on George's River, which
flows into Botany Bay, Through this town is the leading
thoroughfare from Sydney to all the southern districts. On either
side of the road, as we passed along, we observed some
decent-looking places, and in many parts the scenery is pleasing;
but altogether it is very uninteresting. Liverpool, distant about
twenty miles from Sydney, was formerly a place of great promise;
but now it is little better than a deserted town. There are said to
be about 120 houses in it; and the buildings are as neat as any
other town in the colony, with a population of some 600 or 700
inhabitants. The town is planned out on a large scale, with wide
streets and a macadamised road; the former, however, are still
covered with grass for want of traffic. It was raining heavily as
we entered the town, which did not improve the forlorn aspect of
the place. The few people we spoke to wore a dejected air, and
seemed to entertain no hope of the future. They looked forward to
the establishment of a railway to revive their drooping spirits and
silent town. Together with Richmond, Windsor, and Campbelltown, it
returns one member to the Legislative Council.</p>

<p>From Liverpool to Sydney there is a turnpike-road all the way,
rather dusty in dry weather, and muddy in the wet season; the land
on each side is enclosed by substantial post-and-rail fences. The
soil, from what we could judge, appeared of a very poor character;
and we were informed that its virgin properties for cultivation had
been impoverished many years ago, when it was abandoned by the
plough, and allowed to return to its natural state. This is
apparent from the young growth of the timber, which covers it
densely in many places; scarcely a vestige is to be seen of the
giant trees which composed the primeval forest that grew thereon
when the colony was first established. There is not much that is
worthy of notice on the road, excepting a very substantial and
elegant bridge over South Creek, a tributary of George's River.
After travelling fourteen miles along this uninteresting road, you
are agreeably surprised by suddenly emerging into the Parramatta
road, about six miles from Sydney, and opposite one of the most
characteristic roadside inns that we have seen in the country.
Here, as we mingled amongst the pedestrians, horsemen, carts, and
carriages which gave life to this thoroughfare leading to the city
of Sydney, we no longer supposed ourselves travelling in the land
of gold and gum-trees, tea and damper. There was so much of what is
called civilisation in the aspect of the people and the roadside
scenery, so much that looked thoroughly English, that it required
no great stretch of imagination for us to suppose ourselves
suddenly, conveyed to a turnpike-road in the mother country,
instead of journeying along one at the antipodes. We became so
strongly impressed with the fact that we were now approaching the
seat of a great and refined community, that we felt ashamed of our
rough appearance amongst the smartly dressed people who passed us
on their way to the city; therefore, after refreshing ourselves at
one of the inns, we trimmed our exterior, which had grown to seed
in the wilderness. As we trotted along the well-worn road, we were
delighted with every thing we saw and met by the wayside. Here were
rows of neat suburban cottages,&mdash;there a stately mansion in
the midst of a beautiful garden, which told of the residences of
wealthy citizens, who had the means to retire from the bustle and
dust of the city; again we passed comfortable-looking inns, with
their swinging sign-posts; and the people we met looked at us with
those uninquisitive glances which only come from the inhabitants of
a large town.</p>

<p>Passing through a toll-bar, in half a mile you enter the
precincts of the city of Sydney, where the road has been cut
through a hill&mdash;very much like a railway-cutting in England. A
short distance beyond this you obtain a view of the city; and being
somewhat upon elevated ground, the prospect before you is extensive
and exceedingly picturesque. Upon your left hand appears Darling
Harbour; where there is always to be seen a number of large
square-rigged vessels lying at anchor, besides steamboats and
coasting craft. On its western shore stands Pyrmont, a suburb of
Sydney, built upon a hill of sandstone exposed to the full strength
of the sun's rays, without a tree to relieve the glare; presenting
a striking contrast to the "Glebe," another suburb adjacent to it,
which is densely covered with exotic trees and part of the original
forest, sheltering most agreeably the elegant residences built upon
it. On the opposite shore you see the mass of houses which form
greater part of the city, extending for upwards of a mile and a
half along the point of land on which they are built, gradually
rising from the low ground before you to the height of about 250
feet at the extreme point, upon which is erected a telegraph
station and saluting battery. Altogether this peep of Darling
Harbour is very fine, and we have seen it produce a beautiful
dioramic effect, when the setting sun threw Pyrmont into the shade,
and its ruby beams became reflected, like glittering lamps, from
the windows on the Sydney side. But this is not the whole extent of
view commanded by this position: on your right hand, as far as the
eye can reach across a small valley, are streets rising above one
another of substantial stone-built houses, until they crown the
heights in the background; while in the foreground there is a
church of no mean appearance, a large public building, and several
chimneys belonging to manufactories of various kinds; all serving
to give you an idea of the wealth and importance of this
metropolitan city at our antipodes. We must not omit to mention,
that although this view of Sydney presents a most agreeable and
striking effect to the eye of the stranger who enters it for the
first time in that direction, still it can bear no comparison with
the unequalled beauty of the scenery, and the aspect of the city,
as you approach it from the harbour.</p>

<p>Descending the slope where the road leads into the town, you
enter Parramatta-street, formed of straggling shops and
dwelling-houses; on your right hand is an extensive building used
as a distillery and a steam flour-mill, adjoining which stands the
largest brewery in the colony. Proceeding onward in this direction
for about half a mile, you come to the Hay-market, passing on your
way Christ Church and the Benevolent Asylum. All along the road
through this suburb looks like the approach to an English
market-town: the small green-grocers, with bundles of hay and straw
at their doors; the dealers in odds and ends for country customers;
the blacksmith's forge, with the horses waiting to be shod; and the
snug roadside inns, where carriers and small settlers with dairy
and farm produce put up, whom you may see sitting on side benches
outside the doors, smoking their pipes and quaffing their tankards
of ale; while the more noisy customers may be heard dancing inside
to the sound of a fiddle. The most uproarious and extravagant
frequenters of these tap-rooms, it will be readily supposed, are
now the successful returned gold-diggers. Should you have the
curiosity to venture into one of them, you will see how lavishly
these men squander their earnings: "Easy come, easy go," is their
maxim. At the same time, drunkenness has not increased among the
people in Sydney much beyond its former extent. And it must be
remembered that the great bulk of these people cannot be called
habitual drunkards; for during their occupations in the interior
they have no means of indulging in stronger stimulants than tea and
tobacco: hence when they arrive at any of the principal towns, with
their purses well filled, they launch into the extremes of
dissipation, like sailors after a long cruise.</p>

<p>The Hay-market is a large open space at the foot of Brickfield
hill, with a substantial market-house in the middle of it,
surmounted by a turret-clock. Ascending Brickfield hill, you pass
along a wide and airy street, with rows of two and three storied
houses. When you arrive at the top of it, you enter George-street,
the principal street in the city, and about a mile and a half long.
In a newly-settled country like Australia, the traveller expects to
find all the streets of the towns and cities laid out upon the most
approved modern plans&mdash;wide, straight, and intersecting each
other at right angles&mdash;which we have found to be the case in
most of the towns we have hitherto described; but this street, and
several others in Sydney, are an exception to the rule, and they
meander through the motley groups of buildings in as picturesque a
fashion as any streets you may find in the oldest towns of the
mother country. In fact, Sydney resembles very much an English
seaport-town; and you are reminded at every step as you proceed
along this street of the strictly British character of its
inhabitants; the same bustling throng is to be found here fresh as
the imported wares from Manchester or Birmingham; the carts, cabs,
omnibuses, and private equipages which roll along give a life to
the street that is thoroughly British. The same kind of
butcher-boys and baker-men, cab-drivers, and 'bus-conductors; even
the constables who quietly pace the pavement are the veritable
metropolitan police, from their hats to their truncheons. Here you
pass a church in the midst of its old-fashioned burial-ground; a
little farther on you see the police-office, with the stocks
erected outside; next you come to a spacious covered-in market
thronged with buyers from daylight until midnight on Saturdays;
then you pass the <i>Royal Hotel</i>, a perfect leviathan of an
inn. On your reaching the Post-office you come to the region of
banking-houses, auction-rooms, and merchants' offices, where most
of the financial and commercial transactions of the colony are
arranged: this takes you past the old barrack-square, now deserted
by the military, and all improvements at a standstill for want of
labour; then the street narrows with loftier houses on each side
until you come to far-famed Sydney Cove; beyond this the buildings
are fewer, and only on one side of the street, when finally they
cease at its extreme end at Dawes Point, where a glorious peep of
the harbour, with its busy shipping, meets the eye: thus presenting
a complete panorama of English customs and institutions,
established and perpetuated by colonial enterprise.</p>

<p>Returning south along another street branching from this point,
you ascend the flag-staff hill, the highest part of the city. From
here you have a most extensive view of Sydney and its environs; and
the mingled beauties of land and water which surround you have a
most charming effect. So tortuous do the ramifications of the
harbour appear from this height, that it looks very much like a
hilly country with the valleys inundated; and the snow-white
appearance of the drift-sand which covers the suburban hills to the
south remind you of snow, where it is almost never known to fall.
All around you there appears something anomalous in the landscape;
yet on a clear day&mdash;and when is it otherwise in
Sydney?&mdash;the view from this eminence is surpassingly
beautiful. At every point of the compass the artist can select a
distinct picture. Looking towards the east, he has the placid
waters of Port Jackson lying at his feet, locked in the arms of a
succession of picturesque headlands, and studded with small
islands; the white sails of every description of boat and ship are
at all times to be seen entering and departing from its snug haven.
Turning to the north, he sees the main arm of this estuary
separating the land by a narrow channel, and the opposite shore
studded with little villas in fine contrast with the rocky cliffs
on which they are built. To the westward, the glassy surface of
this tortuous inlet is seen penetrating with many arms into the
bosom of the country, which appears low and undulating, until it is
bounded in the distance by the far-famed Blue Mountains, clad in
that hue which the artist delights to throw into his picture, and
which gave rise to their name. In the foreground, the suburbs of
Balmain, Pyrmont, and the Glebe, separated from each other by
Johnstone's Bay, and from Sydney by Darling Harbour, are all
crowded with picturesque objects, which give life and animation to
the scene. Turning to the south and south-east, the extent of
Sydney is seen from this commanding position to great advantage;
you look down upon the densest part of the city, where the masts
from the shipping in the Cove mingle with the narrow streets and
high houses which crowd around it, giving you an idea of its
mercantile importance as a seaport-town; and yet it presents very
little of that dirty aspect to be seen about a British port,
particularly about noon on a summer day, when the appearance of the
mass of buildings which compose the city, so white and smokeless,
suggests the idea of their being marble structures. There are few
climates in the world less destructive to the adornments of
architecture than that of Australia; and Sydney, being built upon
quarries of freestone, has inexhaustible materials for building;
still John Bull, in his haste to make money, has neglected these
advantages, and this beautifully-situated town cannot as yet boast
of many elegant public buildings. Amongst the most conspicuous are,
the New Government-house, the Australian Subscription Library, the
Court-house, and the churches of various denominations.</p>

<p>Descending from this hill towards the east, you pass through
several streets until you come to Sydney Cove, where you see at
once the natural capabilities of this harbour. Here the passenger
arriving from England has none of those disagreeable contingencies
to encounter on landing which he experiences at Victoria, as we
have described at Melbourne and Geelong; for at once the vessel
casts anchor within a cable's-length of the shore, and in a few
days she is hauled alongside a wharf as snugly as in the London or
Liverpool Docks. To families who are desirous of establishing
themselves as comfortably in these colonies as the present state of
circumstances will admit, Sydney is the preferable spot to land at;
and we would strongly advise strangers to take up even a temporary
residence in this city, as the least expensive place to live in, if
they wish to become initiated into the ways of the colonists.</p>

<p>The population of the city and suburbs of Sydney may be taken at
60,000, although since the gold-discoveries it has been fluctuating
between that and 50,000; and the proportion of males to females,
which was formerly in excess by 5000, is becoming more equalised.
Much has been said concerning the people of Sydney, to their
disparagement, of the expression of their faces&mdash;what some
writers are pleased to call their villainous-looking countenances;
for our parts we are not such critical observers as these would-be
physiognomists, nor did we feel inclined to inquire into the
history of every person we came in contact with: we were satisfied
with the demeanour and generally respectable appearance of the
population. Every thing the stranger sees, as we have remarked
elsewhere, is thoroughly English; and the probability is, that the
great mass of the people you meet on the streets are English
emigrants. According to the census, two-thirds of the population
are either members of the Church of England or other Protestant
denominations, the remaining third being Roman Catholics and other
persuasions. We never in any part of England were in a town where
the Sabbath was better observed; and the many highly respectable,
eminent, and zealous ministers, and also the many charitable and
useful institutions which abound there, are a full answer to those
individuals who prejudice our minds to think unfavourably of this
community.</p>

<p>The public institutions of Sydney are numerous. Until lately
there were four colonial banks in operation; there are still two,
the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Bank. There are
likewise two Anglo-colonial banks, the Bank of Australasia and the
Union Bank of Australia. The Bank of Australasia is a chartered
bank, the other four are joint-stock banks, and all are banks of
issue. Besides these, there are the Savings Bank, and the British
Colonial Bank and Loan Company; likewise the Australian
Agricultural Company, the Australian Steam Navigation Company, the
Sydney Gas-light Company, the Australian Sugar Company, the Sydney
Salting Company, the Australian Trust Company, the Scottish
Australian Investment Company, the Sydney Alliance Marine, Life,
and Fire Insurance Companies, the Australian General Assurance
Company, and the Australian Colonial and General Life Assurance
Annuity Company.</p>

<p>There is a plentiful supply of religious establishments of
different denominations in the city: Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Roman Catholics, and Wesleyans, as well as members of the
Independent or Congregational Church, and of the Baptist Chapel,
may all find faithful and zealous ministers attached to their
different creeds. The Society of Friends have likewise a chapel,
and the Jews a synagogue, in the city.</p>

<p>Of religious societies, there are the Auxiliary Bible Society of
New South Wales, the Australian Diocesan Committee, the Australian
Religious Tract Society, an auxiliary of the British Catholic
Institution, the Wesleyan Auxiliary Missionary Society, the Ladies'
Bible Association, and the Bethel Union.</p>

<p>There are several charitable and useful institutions, of which
the following are the chief: the Benevolent Society, the Sydney
Dispensary, the Sydney Strangers' Friend Society, the Sydney Dorcas
Society, New South Wales Temperance Society, total abstinence
societies, and several benefit or friendly societies.</p>

<p>The public establishments for education are also numerous. There
are, the Australian University (having professors at high
salaries); the Sydney College, and the Australian College (which,
however, might with greater propriety be denominated high-schools);
St. Mary's Archi-episcopal Seminary; the Normal Institution, and
the Australian School Society. In addition to these, there are six
schools attached to the Church of England, seven to the
Presbyterian Church, six to the Roman Catholic Church, and one to
the Wesleyan; all receiving support from the government. Besides
these, there are an Independent and a Baptist school, and several
others, which receive no assistance from the state.</p>

<p>Connected with the subject of education are literary and
scientific associations. Among these may be mentioned, the Sydney
Mechanics' School of Arts, the Australian Subscription Library and
Reading-rooms, the Church Book Society, the Clerical Book Society,
the New South Wales Law Library, and the Australian Museum and
Botanic Gardens.</p>

<p>Sydney can also boast of masonic, odd-fellows', and other
lodges; the Australian Club, a glee-club, and two cricket-clubs.
Nor is she deficient in the number of her legal and medical
advisers; for there are no fewer than 40 barristers, 110 attorneys,
solicitors, and proctors, and upwards of 200 qualified medical
practitioners.</p>

<p>The press is also flourishing. There are two daily newspapers,
the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and the <i>Empire</i>; the
<i>Sydney Chronicle</i>, published three times a week; the
<i>Government Gazette</i> and the <i>Australian</i>, twice a week;
eight weekly publications, the <i>Atlas, Squatter, Courier, Times,
Sentinel, Bell's Life, Gleaner, Age</i>.</p>

<p>The corporation act, 6th Vict. No. 3, declares the town of
Sydney to be a city, and incorporates the inhabitants thereof,
dividing it into six wards, viz. Gipps, Bourke, Brisbane,
Macquarie, Cook, Philip. Four councillors are elected for each
ward; from these, or from citizens qualified to be councillors, six
aldermen are chosen; and from the aldermen and councillors the
mayor is elected. The mayor is an annual appointment. Four of the
councillors retire annually, while three of the aldermen remain in
office for three years, and the other three for six years."*</p>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. THE TURON
DIGGINGS.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:2%; font-size:1.1em">Remarks upon the
gold-discovery&mdash;Peaceable demeanour of the diggers&mdash;Road
to the Turon&mdash;Formation of the country between Sydney and the
gold-fields&mdash;The Parramatta road&mdash;Town of
Parramatta&mdash;The Bathurst road&mdash;Ascending the Blue

Golden Point&mdash;Prodigious labours of the miners&mdash;Good
conduct of the people&mdash;Floods on the Turon&mdash;Hardships of
a gold-digger's life.</p>

<p>A GREAT deal has been said about the excitement which prevailed
among the colonists upon the announcement of the gold-discovery by
Mr. Hargreaves; and some English journalists have commented rather
unfairly upon the first adventurers who were attracted to the
gold-field. They were informed by the colonial press, that men of
all classes and occupations in the community rushed to the Bathurst
country in hopes of obtaining prizes in the gold lottery; and
thereupon took the opportunity of making ill-natured remarks upon
the character of the people of New South Wales generally, and of
those who belonged to the upper walks of society in particular.
With regard to the latter portion of the community who proceeded
thither, it would have been a great wonder to us had they acted
otherwise, and the most enterprising men in the colony quietly
looked on, while others seized the golden opportunity. As far as
actual excitement carried the mass of the people, we question if
there was any thing like the agitation which would have been
created among the populace of the mother country under similar
circumstances. Let us imagine, for example, such a discovery to be
made in the British Isles&mdash;that gold was found by the
ton-weight on the Cumberland hills or Welsh mountains, and that it
was open to all and sundry to gather it&mdash;what classes of the
community would be foremost in the scramble? Certainly not the
labouring class alone; for we cannot suppose that the
badly-remunerated portion of the educated classes would calmly
stand by and see the golden treasures, so easily dug up, pocketed
by navvies and quarrymen. Nothing is more likely than that these
penny-a-liners would be the first to throw down their pens and dig
out a better maintenance for themselves at the point of the
pickaxe.</p>

<p>We do not venture these remarks in our own defence, for we were
none of those who took out licenses to try our fortune at the
diggings; but we do so injustice to those gentlemen who left their
settled occupations at the first announcement, and have since
continued profitably employed at this exciting pursuit; not only
without injury to their reputation, but who, by their presence on
the ground, have exercised considerable influence over the conduct
of the refractory members of the community who were attracted to
the first diggings at Summerhill Creek and on the banks of the
Turon River. Altogether, the conduct of the colonists, during the
complete revolution which this discovery made in their social
relations with one another, and their political relations with the
government, was very praiseworthy. Notwithstanding the accounts
transmitted from some localities of the increase of crime which
prevailed, our impression is, that so important a revolution in the
interests of a community could not have been more peaceably
effected, and compliance with the laws better maintained, than that
which has been recorded of the inhabitants of the much-slandered
colony of New South Wales, after the discovery of her golden
resources.</p>

<p>The immense amount of gold which had been brought down from the
Turon River, and other localities in the Bathurst mountains, and
the interest attached to them as the first auriferous deposits
worked in Australia, determined us upon paying a visit to that
region. Therefore, shortly after our arrival in Sydney, we were
among the thousands who were travelling on the Bathurst road for
these now-celebrated diggings. On referring to the map, it will be
seen that our route lay in a westerly, direction from that city,
the road being regularly macadamised the greater part of the way;
but as there is a shorter route to the Turon than through the town
of Bathurst, we would caution the stranger gold-seeker upon his
arrival in Sydney to be careful in his inquiries as to the cheapest
and best mode of conveyance to these mines, which still rank
amongst the most productive in the colony.</p>

<p>The Turon River is situated in the county of Roxburgh; it rises
near Cullenbullen, and running through the county, divides it from
Wellington county, and then flows into the Macquarie River, The
auriferous workings at the "Golden Point" on the Turon are about
140 miles from Sydney by the Mudgee road, but by Bathurst they are
distant 160 miles.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"There seems to be three distinct geological
formations between Sydney and these gold-fields. The sandstone
formation, upon which that city is built, extending from the
sea-coast to the western base of Mount Victoria, which includes all
the level or undulating lands terminated by Emu plains and the
range of hills called the Blue Mountains. It does not require a
very close examination of the gorges and precipices which the
traveller meets with on crossing these mountains to remove the
surprise expressed by many who have never passed Parramatta, at the
want of energy of the early colonists in allowing them so long to
form the boundary of the colony; for although comparatively
unimportant in altitude, their peculiarly long ranges of mural
precipices, contorted and folded back on one another, present more
formidable barriers, and are more difficult to penetrate, than many
mountain-chains far superior in elevation. Ascending the hill,
traces of intrusive granite veins appear, which are beautifully
developed in the cuttings of the grand pass of Mount Victoria. A
region of granite succeeds as you approach Hartley, alternating
with the sandstone at first, and then entirely replacing it. The
plains round Bathurst are composed of the <i>débris</i> of this
rock, intermixed occasionally with quartz pebbles, the auriferous
qualities of which are strongly asserted by many, although they do
not appear to have been tested as yet. Next comes the region of
schists, quartz, and metals, with which the New South Wales public
have been so rapidly familiarised; the mineral wealth of which
would doubtless be deemed enormous, even in the absence of the
great and overwhelming attraction, the gold. The character of these
ranges differs entirely from that of the Blue Mountain Pass;
precipices are not common in these localities, although they are to
be met with on the bends of the rivers, and in the deep rocky
gullies by which the mountains are cloven."*</p>

<p>[* We copy this graphic and scientific description of the
country through which our journey now lies from a local newspaper,
which will serve to give the reader some idea of its geological
formation, and illustrate, at the same time, the intelligent
jottings to be found in a gold-digger's note-book.]</p>

<p>Before starting from Sydney for the Turon, we made some
addition, in the shape of warm clothing, to our equipment; and we
would recommend others to do the same, especially a double supply
of blankets, as they are necessary during the cold nights, which
occur even in the summer months in that high region. The road, for
three-fourths of the way, is cut through the oldest settled parts
of Australia; consequently the traveller can journey to the very
threshold of these gold-fields in much the same manner that the
people of England travelled before the introduction of railways.
There is a good turnpike-road all the way to Bathurst, 113 miles;
and you can reach it in a stage-coach, reminding you of the palmy
days of the whip and four-in-hand. The first stage of fifteen
miles, between Sydney and Parramatta, presents all these features
of "the road" in perfection, and cannot fail to warm the heart of
the traveller who has recollections of the same in his native land.
After passing Ireland's inn, opposite the Liverpool-road, described
by us on our way to Sydney, the road becomes pleasantly sheltered
by trees; which are again broken at intervals by open spaces
affording picturesque views of the surrounding country. And as the
main branch of the estuary of Port Jackson, known as the Parramatta
River, lies parallel with the road, you obtain two or three
charming glimpses of the scenery on its banks. The distance from
Sydney to Parramatta, by water, is eighteen miles; and there are
steamboats plying to and fro several times in the day.</p>

<p>Arrived at Parramatta, you are much surprised at the extent of
the town, considering the small importance it holds in the
commercial affairs of the colony. The principal street is upwards
of a mile long; and there are said to be between 800 and 900 houses
in the town, one-half of them well built of stone and brick,
besides many public buildings, consisting of a government-house, a
handsome court-house, an observatory, military barracks, churches,
&amp;c. &amp;c., all suggesting the existence of a flourishing and
well-disciplined town. On inquiry, however, you find that
two-thirds of the houses are but scantily tenanted, the barracks
are empty, the observatory shut up, and the other public
institutions almost deserted; and that this has been the case for
many years prior to the gold-discovery. The fact is, that this town
mainly owed its existence to the establishment of an extensive
factory for the punishment of female prisoners, during the period
when it was a penal settlement. Since the cessation of
transportation it has gradually declined, not having either
agricultural or mercantile resources of sufficient amount to keep
the population employed, who had formerly depended upon the
government expenditure. Excepting a large steam flour-mill, and one
or two manufactories of tweed cloths from colonial wool, there is
not much going on to revive the trade of the place; and it is too
near Sydney to form a depôt for furnishing the settlers in the
interior with supplies, the traffic passing <i>through</i> it to
the great emporium at the seaport. Hence the only class of people
who seem to be doing a good business are the innkeepers; and they
are reaping a rich harvest during these golden times, for this is
the first town of any great size you meet with after leaving
Bathurst on the way to Sydney. Of course, as all over the colony,
those persons who still were in the place could think and talk of
nothing else but gold, and speculate as to its effect upon their
town, every new arrival from the gold-fields occasioning a change
of opinion.</p>

<p>Here the governor has his country-seat, a building sufficiently
large for his suite; and from the retirement of the spot, and other
advantages, he makes it his residence for several months in the
year. It is also a great resort for the Sydney people, who form
pleasure-parties to the gardens belonging to the comfortable inns
which it possesses. Above the point of navigation, the stream
dwindles into a rocky water-course, where there is scarcely any
current during the greater part of the year: over it is built a
substantial stone bridge. Upon the north side of the river is an
establishment for the education and maintenance of female orphans,
which is very creditable to the colony; besides which, there are
several other charitable institutions.</p>

<p>The Bathurst road proceeds along the southern side of the town,
where the land rises gently, affording a view of the surrounding
country. On your left stands Prospect-hill, from the summit of
which we were told a most extensive view is obtained; and around it
are several cultivated fields belonging to the estate of Mr.
Lawson. Although the traffic on the road here is very considerable,
and it is liable to be greatly cut up by drays and carts laden with
merchandise for the diggings, still it is in better condition than
the Parramatta road, from being naturally well drained. The country
all along this stage of the road to the village of Penrith,
eighteen miles from Parramatta, is very pleasing, with the usual
alternations of forest-land and clearings, where you see the
residences of the oldest settlers in the colony. The soil appears
light, and not very productive, if we may judge by the scanty crops
which grow thereon.</p>

<p>The village of Penrith consists merely of one long street, built
on the roadside: it contains about 300 inhabitants, when the male
portion are all at home; but as that has now become a matter of
uncertainty since the gold-discovery, it seldom musters more than
two-thirds of that number, and these are the women and children. At
this stage of your journey you come to the Nepean River, which
forms the upper portion of the Hawkesbury, a stream formerly of
great importance to the colonists before they had penetrated beyond
the Blue Mountains; on its banks were the principal agricultural
farms; but from the devastating effects of the floods to which it
is liable, most of the settlers were obliged to leave it. You cross
the river at this place in a punt, from which you obtain a
delightful view up and down its banks; and landing on the opposite
shore, the road leads you through another embryo town named Emu.
This is the commencement of your up-hill journey; therefore we
would advise you to start fresh, both man and beast. After
ascending the hills which form the western bank of the river, you
cross Emu plains, a table-land at a considerable elevation above
the level of the sea. At Twenty-mile Hollow there is a sensible
difference in the temperature of the air from that which you feel
before reaching the Nepean; and if you are not accustomed to
bivouac at night in the open air, we would advise you to push on to
the "Weather-board Hut," where you will find tolerably good
accommodation. Skirting the base of the Blue Mountains, and
ascending Mount Victoria, until you come to the famous Victoria
Pass, the road has been cut through the solid rocks, and presents
in many places the surprising efforts of such a young community to
overcome the deficiencies of nature. It is well known, however,
that this work has been accomplished by prison-labour in the early
settlement of the colony.</p>

<p>It will be supposed by the intelligent reader that the
traveller, during the ascent of the Blue Mountains, does not
experience much of that monotony which we have stated is the
prevailing character of the scenery throughout Australia, for there
are views of stupendous grandeur among their mountain glens that
will awaken the dullest imagination. And should these prove
ineffectual in rousing the attention of the gold-seeker, there is
enough in the unusual exertion and anxiety required in toiling up
the steep ascents to give life to the road, which sometimes
presents novelties fraught with danger on the journey, especially
if the traveller has the management of any vehicle. From the
continual stoppages occasioned by casualties amongst the wearied
men and animals at this rugged part of the road, you meet with more
people than at any other stage, particularly after you have scaled
these stupendous natural walls and begin to descend on the western
flank of the mountains, which are of easy and gradual descent. Here
we passed crowds of people on horseback and on foot, driving carts
and wagons of every description; and one persevering fellow we saw
actually with a wheelbarrow, who had surmounted all the obstacles
in his way over Mount Victoria.</p>

<p>Scarcely have you left that wild region of desolation behind,
when you traverse a valley through which the road winds, in every
way a perfect contrast to it. This is the Vale of Clywd, the most
beautiful valley in New South Wales, a perfect gem in the lap of
these mountains, situated at the base of Mount York, and watered by
Cox's River, an eastern stream which flows into the Wollondilly.
That portion of it, however, which has called forth our praise is
not more than six miles long in an easterly and westerly direction,
through which runs a small stream called the River Lett, on which
stands the town of Hartley. This valley was named the Vale of Clywd
by Governor Macquarie in 1815, in consequence of the strong
resemblance it bears to the vale of that name in North Wales.
Hartley stands in a most delightful part of this valley, and is
altogether a very romantic-looking village, in a situation that
would bear comparison with some of those charming spots which the
traveller finds among the Swiss Alps, or any other wildly
mountainous country. At present it cannot boast of many
inhabitants, nor are its streets easily defined, but it is
increasing steadily; and should the fortunate gold-diggers become
wearied of their rough life, here is the spot for them to settle
down upon, and turn their plethora of gold into the healthy channel
of agricultural pursuits. It possesses several remarkably clean and
comfortable inns, and the houses are well built; which may be said
also of many others scattered throughout the valley. Passing
through Hartley, which is seventy-eight miles from Sydney, you come
to another rising village, named Bowenfels, about seven miles from
Haines's inn.</p>

<p>At Bowenfels the road separates, the main branch to the left
being the Bathurst road, and the tract on your right being the
Mudgee road,&mdash;the shortest route to the Turon. Along the
latter road we pursued our journey. The first improvements we came
to on the way were those of a Mr. Brown, who has erected
flour-mills in this locality, worked by water brought from some
considerable distance, having availed himself skilfully of his
situation. He has an excellent house, with good out-offices, and
much land enclosed and under cultivation; altogether a very pretty
place, surrounded by the mountains. Continuing onward, we arrived
at the Middle River; close to which is the "Welcome inn," about
twenty miles from Hartley&mdash;a very tolerable house of
accommodation, no doubt, in quiet times; but we found it a very
noisy place to expect any rest in,&mdash;so after our day's journey
of forty miles we bivouacked at a convenient spot, and rested
comfortably for the night under the open canopy of the heavens.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning we were <i>en route</i> for Keening's
public-house, the next place of accommodation on the way. Our road
lay through some fine open valleys, with here and there extensive
alluvial flats, upon which there were settlers located, and
improvements in building going forward. This discovery of gold has
been the means of bringing these high lands into cultivation, where
they would otherwise have remained untilled for ages. Within about
four miles of Keening's, on the left side of the road, there is a
comfortable residence belonging to a gentleman of the name of
Cadell, whom we met afterwards at the inn, when he very obligingly
invited us to his house on our return. After a journey of nineteen
miles from the Middle River you arrive at Keening's public-house,
situated very near to some rugged mountains, called Crown Ridge.
All about this place is very pretty; and should the golden
prospects of the district be realised, it may become a township of
some importance, and prove of great value to its proprietor, Mr.
Cadell.</p>

<p>From Keening's to the Turon River over the mountains was said to
be nine and a half miles; and to the first water, at Bandanora
Creek, eight miles. As the latter route was the shortest of the
two, and as it would give us an opportunity of seeing the upper
part of the Turon, we determined upon taking it, though the
country, we were informed, was very mountainous and difficult to
travel over. However, with the assistance of a man going the same
way,&mdash;in spite of his being rather drunk, but whom we were
told by Mr. Cadell we could depend on,&mdash;we passed over, and
were rewarded for our trouble, the scenery being in many places
beautiful and grand. The insurmountable obstacles, of which we had
heard so much before starting, as is frequently the case, vanished
as we approached them; and our inebriated guide was just one of
those spirits who take things as they come, with good
humour,&mdash;so we got over the ground cheerfully together. The
land in this high district, which no doubt is severely cold in
winter, is much better covered with grass than we could have
supposed,&mdash;better, in fact, than any we had seen in the low
country between it and Sydney, except on the banks of rivers. As
breeding-runs for cattle these mountain districts must prove highly
valuable. Making the Bandanora Creek, we rode down its banks for a
mile and a half or so, and came upon the Turon River, which at this
spot is but a small stream. We then followed its course for about
eight miles, crossing and recrossing its bed several times, until
we came to a spot, shortly after sun-down, where we found plenty of
grass and water; and there we halted and made ourselves comfortable
for the night after the bush fashion.</p>

<p>As usual, we were early astir and journeying towards the
diggings, some fourteen miles lower down. Riding along for a few
miles, we passed many parties at work upon what is called the Upper
Turon, all of whom had been more or less successful in finding
gold. At Arthur's sheep-station they increased in number, until
multitudes appeared busily at work upon the right bank of the
river, as we traced its course downwards, which the diggers have
appropriately named "Golden Point." The scene was very striking,
and the busy hum and rattle which resounded through the valley was
animating in the extreme. The men whom we spoke to were civil and
communicative, though with a certain reserve. There were great
differences in their statements as to their success; some had been
fortunate, others the reverse; but all were of opinion that there
were inexhaustible supplies of gold on the banks of the river. We
selected for our bivouac a spot on the opposite side to the Golden
Point, about a mile below it, and some three or four hundred yards
back from the river, near the road which passes over the hills to
Bathurst. From this position we commanded a view up and down the
river for a considerable distance; and most singular was the scene,
particularly after night had set in, when the fires of each party
blazed in myriads from the bed of the creek up to the summit of the
hills. We were reminded of the wild and tumultuous encampment of an
irregular army in a mountainous country, which we had seen in our
younger days; and the firing of guns and pistols from time to time
by some of the parties during the night, with the bandit appearance
of the different groups at their fires, added to the idea.</p>

<p>As we leaned our head that night on our saddle for a pillow, we
could not help ruminating upon the probable result of all this
rushing to and fro of multitudes in search of the coveted metal.
The masses of gold found on the banks of this river, and other
auriferous deposits, no longer permit the most incredulous even to
doubt but that gold and other valuable metals exist in this
territory to an amount it is impossible to calculate. The ministers
of state who regulate the affairs of our colonial empire have here
a new question for their deliberation in council. For the first
time in the annals of our ancient kingdom the Sovereign possesses
full power and dominion over a gold region. Not a mere nominal
territory of the kind such as history makes mention of among the
Scottish, Welsh, and Irish hills; but a vast region promising a
yield of the pure metal far exceeding in quantity any thing which
has been heard of in the gold-mines of Russia, Mexico, or even
California. Hence they have no historical experience to guide them
in protecting the interests of the state under such circumstances,
or in ascertaining the probable effects this discovery will have
upon the political bearing of the colonists, or the influence which
a large body of foreign immigrants may have over the minds of the
people. We have met with demagogues in the colony, even a reverend
demagogue, who did not except the Sabbath-day for the promulgation
of his pernicious doctrines, to proclaim Australian independence.
We trust, however, that there will be found too much loyalty to our
noble empire in the hearts of the colonists for them to take the
course so broadly suggested by these demagogues,&mdash;the enemies
to its unity. They may rest assured that these men are ignorant of
the power of their country, as they are presumptuous in supposing
that a mere handful of people could successfully revolt against it,
to the ruin of themselves and their dupes, without any just cause
whatever. Such grievances as there may be, real or supposed, should
be fully inquired into, with the determination to do all that is
right.</p>

<p>In the morning we mingled amongst the diggers, and saw them in
full work with their cradles at Golden Point. One party of six men
had for their morning's work upwards of three ounces. At this part
of the river many were doing much better than that, while some were
doing less, and others whom we spoke to had not procured any. From
the general success, however, which every one sooner or later met
with, there is no question whatever as to gold not only being found
in the bed of the creek and at Golden Point, but in the mountains
around. That which we saw in the cradles was washed out of earth
dug many feet deep in the bank, and which had probably been below
the action of water for ages. And as the earth brought from the
very tops of the hills, for miles back from the river, contained
gold, there seems to be every reason to conclude, that the general
opinion of the Turon diggings being inexhaustible will be fully
borne out.</p>

<p>To obtain the gold at this locality, however, there seems to be
more labour required than at the other spots we had visited. The
quantity of earth which has been moved in the bed of the river, and
the excavations on the hill-sides, must be seen to be credited.
They are a proof not only of what man can and will do for gold, but
also of the great energy and physical strength of the population.
At Oakey Creek, a tributary of the Turon, their labours must have
been prodigious, judging from the rocks of enormous size which had
been moved by sheer bodily strength. The number of people at work
upon this river and its tributary creeks, it would be difficult for
us to estimate correctly, for the thousands we saw at work were
being added to every hour by fresh arrivals; and then, again,
others would be seen flying away like mad people whenever they
heard that a fresh deposit had been discovered somewhere else,
fearing that they should be too late in choosing their claims. Talk
of slavery and prison-labour, indeed! no class of human beings
working under the punishment of the lash ever laboured as these men
do. It matters not what position they held in society before, all
are alike, gentle and simple, one universal passion absorbs all
their thoughts&mdash;the lust for gold; and for this they will work
and toil under the blazing sun, and beneath the pouring rain,
heedless of the inclemency of the weather. What leading-articles
should we not have in the columns of our best public instructors,
if men were compelled to labour and to suffer as these people do
voluntarily! No language would be too strong to use against the
government that was so atrocious as to sanction the treatment of
people in a manner such as these diggers voluntarily submit to. We
have seen road-gangs labouring in chains, and we have seen slaves
toiling under the lash; and we do not hesitate to say that their
labours were easy compared to that of the great majority of
successful Australian gold-seekers. But then they are
free!&mdash;that magic word, which sweetens the heaviest toils; the
motives they labour for, all men understand,&mdash;the desire and
the hope of independence. And we are free to confess, as we have
before stated, that had we been in a position to have acted as we
pleased, we should have remained amongst them, and risked our
fortune with theirs.</p>

<p>The good conduct of the people at this locality, as well as the
others we subsequently visited, was beyond all praise; to the
colony most creditable; and an answer in some degree to those who
seem to take a delight in saying uncivil, not to say untrue things
of the masses working at this occupation. It is also an answer to
those who abuse Britain, and attribute rottenness to her
institutions; and when we remember the accounts transmitted to us
of the doings in California, and the lawless state which even now
prevails amongst society there, we cannot but feel a pride in the
respectability and morality of the population of this British
settlement, under circumstances equally exciting and hostile to law
and order, as those which ushered in the discovery of gold there.
When put in contrast with the motley population and the system of
brigandage which appears to rule the people there, the colonists of
New South "Wales can safely throw back in their teeth the vile
imputations the press of California has made against their
character, and by the calm and orderly bearing they have maintained
show an example for them to follow; and we believe that the crimes
which have occurred on their shores, and attributed to Sydney
people, will be found in many cases to have been committed by their
own citizens. But it must be remembered that in our high estimation
of the character of the Australian gold-diggers, we speak of a
population strictly British and colonial, not having been subject
as yet to the influence of visitors from California, or from the
disappointed desperadoes who may perhaps congregate here, and do
their best to aid in creating mischief; otherwise we may leave an
impression upon the reader's mind that order may always
continue.</p>

<p>While we were at Keening's public-house, we heard a report of a
man having been murdered at the Turon by a fellow-labourer driving
a pickaxe into his skull, in a fight about the possession of a
hole. After careful inquiries this report was found to be a pure
invention, probably by some evil-minded person, to whom the good
conduct of the people became an annoyance; or perhaps it may have
proceeded from that strange habit some persons have of
<i>inventing</i> news, for the sake of the little importance which
attaches to them for the time being. We are sorry to find that some
English journals seize upon these rumours with avidity, and publish
them with unfavourable comments upon the people of New South
Wales.</p>

<p>The Turon River, like many others in Australia, is liable to
sudden floods, from which already there have been some losses in
life and property among the diggers; and it will require every
precaution on their part to guard against them in future. At the
commencement of the diggings here, which were among the first in
the country, the great mass of people who flocked thither were
townspeople, who, comparatively speaking, knew very little about
the country, or the exigencies of a bush life; hence they
encountered privations, and met with accidents, which any
experienced bushman could have avoided. Here, however, the excess
of water proves as injurious to the gold-seeker, as in other
localities its absence is felt to be the greatest drawback; and
there is as much discomfort to contend with in soaking tents and
damp blankets during the winter, on the banks of the Turon, as in
eating dusty food and going with unwashed bodies during the summer
at Mount Alexander. Verily the gold-digger's life is a hard life,
and the labourer is worthy of his earnings.</p>

<p>Leaving the Turon River and its busy population to their
gold-burrowings, we struck across the country in a south-west
direction, making for the town of Bathurst, distant thirty-five
miles. It is a good day's journey on horseback over the rough
mountain-track you have to traverse. The country you pass through
is generally very indifferent; the only patches of good soil that
appear on the way are in the valleys near the homesteads belonging
to Mr. Suttor and others, who are some of the oldest settlers in
this district. The sheep at these establishments looked tolerably
well, considering that the grasses in those high lands have not the
fattening properties possessed by the grasses at lower altitudes.
As you approach Bathurst the character of the country changes very
suddenly, and you pass through an extensive plain, which presents a
striking contrast to the mountain scenery you have left, having
rather a desolate appearance, from being destitute of trees, "This
transalpine country was considered inaccessible until 1813. It
consists in general of broken table-land; in some places forming
extensive downs, without a tree, such as Bathurst Plains, which
include 50,000 acres. Occasional open downs of this description
extend along the banks of the Macquarie River for full 120 miles.
They are not unlike the Brighton Downs of England; but with this
remarkable peculiarity, that on the summits of some of the
elevations or knolls there are found dangerous quagmires or bogs,
resembling sometimes a pond that has been dried up, but at other
times concealed by a rich verdure." Such is a general description
of the country around Bathurst, given by Mr. Wells in his excellent
Geographical Dictionary of Australia, which, although possessing
many unavoidable errors, is a creditable book to be got up in so
young a literary community as Australia.</p>

<p>The town of Bathurst, so well known to the world since these
gold-discoveries, is situated in the middle of the plains we have
just alluded to, on the banks of the Macquarie, 113 miles from
Sydney. Even before the memorable year 1851, it was considered to
be the largest inland town in the colony, and contained nearly 400
good houses, mostly of brick and stone, with several neat churches,
a court-house, and many capital hotels, with a population of about
2000. But now, as it is the centre of the richest gold region in
New South Wales, there is every probability of its rivalling the
cities on the coast in prosperity and increase of population. At
the present time, if we take into consideration the number of
inhabitants for several miles around, we are not far out in saying
that Bathurst and its environs has a population of between 6000 and
7000; and as the county of which it is the chief town is famous for
good agricultural land, the time is not far distant when the riches
of its golden grain will equal in value that of its auriferous
deposits.</p>

<p>Among other tokens of its advanced state, it has for many years
possessed a weekly newspaper, called the <i>Bathurst Free
Press</i>, a very creditable periodical. In its columns we were
informed that during the week of our arrival in town the assizes
would be held; we were glad of this, for it gave us an opportunity
of seeing those who may be called the gentry and substantial men of
the county. Certainly a more respectable-looking class of people no
country could desire to possess; and as far as we could learn, the
circumstances and character of the gentlemen assembled upon that
occasion were not inferior to our landed English gentry. Many
persons may be surprised at reading this and think that we are
using exaggerated comparisons; they possibly having no other idea
than the old exploded one, that all the inhabitants of New South
Wales, or at least a very great portion of them, have been either
convicts or descended from them. We are not among those who think
that an error, or, if the reader pleases, a crime, when once atoned
for, should never be forgiven; for we have known many of these
unfortunate people, who, in a crowded state of society and under
adverse fortune, had been betrayed into crime, and others even whom
we considered reckless men, who had paid the penalty of their
crimes, afterwards become honourable and useful members of society.
The squatters, however, and the great body of the people in this
colony possessing property, and thousands of those not possessing
property, are as free, and perhaps far more honest, and certainly,
from our experience, we can safely say they are more just and
generous, than those persons who take a pleasure in speaking
disparagingly of them; and when we have heard people indulge
themselves in this way, we have always endeavoured to remove error
and prejudice from their minds, and checked the tongue of scandal
when it indiscriminately brands one and all with the epithet of
"Botany-Bay felons." Those convict pioneers who assisted in
clearing the wilderness have become lost in the army of free
colonists. They no longer compose the bulk of the labouring
population; and the influence of the more wealthy and
better-educated "emancipists" sides with order and good government.
Any one who would go there and judge for himself will find these
people composed almost solely of free and independent British
subjects, whose self-expatriation has not altered their honest
bearing or moral well-being. To infer otherwise is not only a libel
upon ourselves, but a disparagement of our common national
morality. There they live in every-day communion with each other,
much as we are accustomed to do, and are equally desirous of
instilling into the minds of their children those precepts of
rectitude and virtue which they have carefully carried with them
intact from the land of their fathers; and society there is a
living evidence of the fact, that "the Anglo-Saxon reproduces his
country wherever he hoists his country's flag."</p>

<p>The higher class of settlers in New South Wales, however, are
too proud a body to condescend to defend themselves; and they are
too busy laying the foundation of the future nation to find time or
opportunity to publish to the reading public in the mother country
the responsible position they hold in the social scale among their
fellow-subjects of the British empire. It is only travellers like
ourselves&mdash;idlers by the way&mdash;who, having experienced
their hospitality, and seen their acknowledged worth and integrity,
from a sense of duty, lay these facts and statements illustrative
of their social condition before their fellow-countrymen. We may
further remark, that men do not often forgive, and rarely forget,
an attack upon their characters; and the stupid, untrue, and
mischievous statements we have seen and heard concerning the
settlers of Australia generally, by some factious men, who desire
to stir up contention between the colonists and the parent country,
are far from being expressions of their opinions. There is a deep
feeling of loyalty to our noble empire amongst them; and if any
other feeling arises, it will be owing, not to our countrymen
there, but to ourselves, and to our incapacity to create an empire
of all the communities of Englishmen throughout the world, forming
one vast people in the terms of <i>general union</i> and <i>public
league</i>, but <i>private</i> and <i>domestic independence</i>. We
ventured to indulge in such a dream some years ago; but we fear
apprehension of evil will refuse what we conceive to be the only
remedy, and bring about the results most dreaded. History tells us
that it has always been thus; rulers refuse so long to be just,
that when they give way it is often too late.</p>

<p>From Bathurst to the Ophir gold-fields is full thirty-five
miles. In a few miles after leaving that town and its open plains,
you enter a rugged, wild, mountainous country, with towering
granite and quartz rocks on the way. Occasionally, however, you
come upon some tolerably good flats, covered with pasturage; but
generally speaking the feed is poor and scanty, and the land
apparently much overstocked. It rained very heavily during our
journey, and night approaching as we traversed a country which
became wilder and wilder, we stopped at a spot where there was a
little grass for our horses, and made the best of it for the night.
Our animals were very tired and hungry, and the scanty feed they
got did them but little good; so next morning we pushed on at an
early hour, in hopes of obtaining some provender at Ophir. On
approaching the river, and before we commenced descending the
hills&mdash;which rise steeply, and in some places perpendicularly
from its bed&mdash;we came upon a store; the first thing we
inquired for was some corn for our poor horses; the answer was,
that the minister had that morning asked for some, and he was told
that there was only enough of corn for the postman. Thus our poor
animals suffered severely, as there was no grass around, and it was
wretchedly wet and cold.</p>

<p>These diggings at Ophir are supposed still to be very rich; but
at the time of our visit there were not more than a hundred men at
work: first, the water had been, and was still, very high; and
secondly, they had been drawn away from them by the superior
attractions offered at the Turon and elsewhere. At this particular
spot there has not been found as yet evidences of gold in the
uplands; and, from the rocky character of the locality, it would
appear that the workings cannot be carried on without great labour.
Unless, therefore, they find the gold alluvium as readily as at the
Turon and other diggings, the men for the present will desert them.
During our stay at Ophir, some twenty-four hours, it was a storm of
rain and wind the whole time; and we received shelter from some
kind people during that time, for which we felt very grateful.</p>

<p>We left Ophir for Summerhill Creek diggings, and passed through
a better description of country, where there were some good
homesteads. As it was necessary that our horses should have
something to eat, we stopped at a sheep-station belonging to Mr.
Richard Lane, a gentleman possessing considerable property in this
part of the country. Here there was plenty of grass; and we rested
ourselves in the shepherd's hut while our horses picked up a little
feed. The shepherd was an old sailor, and was full of anecdotes
about the gold-discovery. He told us that about three years before
gold had been found hereabouts by a man of the name of Michael
Magrath, which he sold to a settler for 2<i>l</i>., who resold it
in Sydney for 13<i>l</i>. This and many similar stories current in
the neighbourhood of Bathurst, makes Mr. Hargreaves' successful
discovery and survey of these gold regions the more meritorious, as
he was the man who openly gave the gold-fields of Australia a local
habitation and a name; while others had neither the enterprise nor
the intelligence to follow up their knowledge, founded upon a more
tangible basis than his. We proceeded on our journey; and about
five miles from Ophir, on the Summerhill Creek, at a point below
Castle-hill, we saw not more than two hundred men at work; and
generally they were doing well.</p>

<p>The whole of the surrounding country appears very good for
sheep, cattle, or cultivation. We passed an enclosure in which a
man was ploughing, which caused us to stop and ask him how it was
that he did not do as all the people in the colony appeared to be
doing, viz. abandoning agricultural industry for gold? His reply
was, "Gentlemen, it is a matter of speculation; wheat against gold;
and my corn-fields, I think, will prove to me the better of the
two: people must eat, and if I am not mistaken, I shall make more
by my ploughing the fields, than in the long-run I should by
digging for gold; and not run the same chances of injuring my
health, from being exposed to such a rough mode of living. However,
perhaps I may take a turn for a few weeks at the pick and cradle;
but I will not neglect my fields." This was a wise man; and it is
to be hoped that many small farmers will follow the same sensible
course. It is clear that unless the fields are attended to, there
will, in all probability, be a famine in the land.</p>

<p>The rain came down in torrents as we pursued our journey, and we
gladly accepted the hospitality of a small stockholder, who kindly
offered us shelter for the night; and such accommodation was given
as his small cabin offered. We were in a terrible mess with mud and
wet, and enjoyed the dry hearth of this humble abode, in preference
to proceeding onwards to Mr. Lane's homestead, some little distance
off the road. Our host was a hard-headed, rough fellow of about
fifty-eight years of age; he had been in the country upwards of
forty years. During our stay under his roof, we saw much that was
praiseworthy in this man. He told us he was a native of Norfolk
county; and came from the same village as Nelson, of which he was
justly proud. He had married an Irish emigrant woman; and his
children, six in number, it was very pleasing to see about him. He
had brought them up in a way that would do credit to any Christian
land; and though his wife is a Roman Catholic, his children are of
the Church of England. He had been an industrious man evidently;
for he possessed many hundred head of cattle, and otherwise
appeared very well to do. Altogether we were surprised to find,
under such a rough exterior, such truly Christian feelings as
seemed to direct his conduct and opinions. He expressed regret that
a clergyman did not come more frequently from Bathurst to visit his
neighbourhood. He did not do this in a complaining spirit, but
simply regretted the fact; saying that it was one of the evils of a
young country, that spiritual instruction was so far from the
labouring man; that the clergy were very active and most attentive,
and the hardships they had to undergo in the performance of their
duties would scarcely be credited by their brethren in England. He
mentioned, with great satisfaction, that he had not heard of any
clergyman from either the Churches of England or Rome going to work
at the diggings, though some "preachers" had not scrupled to do so;
and that some Methodists and others, who exclaimed against doing
any work on Sunday, had made an exception, in favour of gold. In
the morning we bade our host good bye, and thanked him for his
hospitality.</p>

<p>Near this honest fellow's abode is the township of Orange, a
place which may increase rapidly as the gold-discoveries progress.
Coming towards Blackman's swamp we passed by Mr. John Lane's, and
also Mr. Templeton's, of Summerhill, both pleasant places, and
about which there appeared to be much good land. Mr. Templeton, we
were informed, had dug gold out of his garden. He has a good
corn-mill, worked by steam; and all about his house, premises, and
gardens, showed the wealthy man.</p>

<p>From this place we turned our horses' heads in the direction of
Carcoar, distant from Orange a fair day's journey, in such bad
roads and heavy rain as we encountered. We first came to
Frederick's Valley, the property of Mr. Wentworth, which was
attracting much attention as a gold deposit; but there were few men
there, in consequence of the cold and wet. The value attached to
certain places in the valley by its proprietor may be imagined from
the sum of 30,000<i>l</i>. being demanded for fifteen acres of
land, of course supposed to be very rich in gold. A specimen of
auriferous ore was obtained from this locality by Mr. Hargreaves,
stated in the <i>Bathurst Free Press</i> to "consist of ferruginous
rock, beautifully dotted with globules of gold." The specimen was
found amongst a quantity of earth with which the Wellington road at
Summerhill had been repaired. Indeed, a portion of the road had
been torn up by the neighbours, who appeared to think it a reckless
waste of wealth to repair the roads with gold! A very large
specimen was exhibited in Sydney shortly afterwards, from the same
quarter, of a similar description. The Rev. W. B. Clarke, one of
the government geologists, in a letter to the Colonial Secretary,
alludes to this unusual matrix for gold in the following terms:
"The occurrence of gold in ironstone has also been exhibited in Mr.
Wentworth's estate; but I believe that that ironstone is merely
quartz cemented by ferruginous matter, and not, as at Turner's of
Bungonia, a compact argillaceous iron ore." Since then a company
has been formed to work this auriferous ore on a large scale, and
there is every likelihood of their making it a profitable
undertaking.</p>

<p>When within five or six miles of Carcoar we stopped at a
roadside inn, which was as much like a place of the sort in the
Weald of Sussex as it is possible to imagine; all about it was
clean and comfortable in appearance. We were not wrong in our
surmises, for we found the landlord a native of that county; and
from this circumstance were greatly tempted to stop, particularly
as it was pouring with rain and getting dark. We were too anxious,
however, to reach Coombing, the estate of Mr. Icely, ten miles
beyond Carcoar; and mine host informed us, unless we crossed the
Belubula Creek at Carcoar that night, we might be prevented the
following day, for the waters were rising rapidly.</p>

<p>We arrived at Carcoar as it became quite dark, and still raining
heavily. The creek had already risen considerably, but it was still
possible to cross it with safety; and as there was no corn in the
village for our horses, we determined at once, and forded the
stream without much difficulty. On the opposite side of the creek
we found a blacksmith's forge, but still no provender for our
hungry animals; therefore, after having a shoe put on one of them,
we proceeded in the direction of Coombing, notwithstanding the
attempt of the kind blacksmith and his wife to dissuade us; for the
road, they said, was intricate, especially to strangers, and the
night so dark and stormy that there was every probability of our
missing the way, and that if we did, a night in the forest would be
our lot. However, as the reader will have concluded by this time,
we are no strangers to bush-travelling; and so, receiving the best
directions the smith could give us, we groped our way through the
woods. We were fortunate in arriving soon and safely at our
destination; but unfortunate in finding that Mr. Icely was from
home. To this gentleman we not only had a letter of introduction
from a mutual friend in Sydney, but one from England; yet so
awkwardly were we situated, that if the night had been fine, and
there was any place near to retreat to, we should have withdrawn.
As it was, our letters were sent in to the ladies, when we were
admitted, and shown into the dining-room, where some refreshment
was placed before us, of which we partook. Afterwards, we requested
the servant to say that we should feel honoured if permitted to pay
our respects to the ladies, when Miss Icely, a most charming girl,
appeared, evidently under some alarm. We excused, as well as we
could, our intrusion, and she seemed to be a little easier, saying,
on withdrawing, she hoped the housekeeper would make us
comfortable. We could not but regret the absence of the father,
which prevented us joining the family circle.</p>

<p>Although Coombing is 155 miles from Sydney, the traveller would
be surprised to find the elegances and comforts which surround Mr.
Icely at this spot. The residence is commodious and spacious, built
in the cottage style, and situated on a knoll in the bosom of the
hills, on the banks of Coombing Creek, with a beautiful,
well-cultivated, and well-arranged fruit and flower garden around
it. His manager has a house three or four hundred yards from the
residence, on the left hand as you approach it, near to which is a
higher knoll, and farther away are the stables and other
out-offices. The whole premises are surrounded by large enclosures
of cultivated, and otherwise reclaimed ground, into which you enter
from the road through a large white gate. Altogether it is a pretty
place, and quite the residence of a country gentleman.</p>

<p>Being anxious to push on towards the Lachlan, we left early,
though it was raining heavily and the creeks much swollen.
Traversing an excellent open forest-country, here and there crowned
by ridges of hills, we arrived at Mr. Rotheray's, about sixteen
miles from Coombing, situated on a rising ground above Limestone
Creek, a tributary of the Lachlan. His residence commands a fine
view of Mount Canobolas and the adjacent range, distant some forty
miles in a north-west direction. Mr. Rotheray, some time a member
of Lincoln's Inn, has a most comfortable dwelling here; and he is
surrounded by an amiable wife and a family of eight children. His
boys, although they are young, are becoming useful to him in these
times, when labour is so scarce. All boys in Australia residing in
the country ride well; and they are soon capable of superintending
sheep and cattle. Really it is difficult to say what would be the
result now in many cases if it was not for them. In old countries
it is a matter of very serious consideration to know how to educate
and find employment for boys; whereas in a country like Australia,
particularly at the present time, it may be truly said, happy is
the man who has his quiver full of them.</p>

<p>There is much cleared land about this residence, and large
grazing paddocks, which were looking beautifully green when we saw
them; but we were informed that the country suffered periodically
from droughts, although Limestone Creek, during the driest and most
distressing years, was never known to fail. As we have elsewhere
remarked, the devastating effects upon sheep and cattle from a
deficiency, or from the absence of this useful element, renders
sheep-farming and cattle-grazing a precarious investment in some
districts; and those alone know the value of water who have
suffered from its scarcity in this country, where death often
sweeps away the squatter's flocks and herds, and brings ruin upon
him. From the name of this creek it will be supposed that limestone
is found on this property; besides this useful mineral, the
surrounding country exhibits quartz veins among the rocks, and
indications, it is said, of copper: from all which there is little
doubt but that it will turn out a rich mineral district.</p>

<p>During our short stay we found Mr. Rotheray in close attendance
upon a poor old man, one of his shepherds, who had been taken ill
at one of his distant sheep-stations. The poor fellow's time was
come. All had been done for him that kindness and experience
suggested, and the skill in medicine which all persons possess in
new countries from being thrown upon their own resources; but in
vain. Had he lived a few hours longer, medical aid would have been
at hand; not that any benefit could have accrued to the patient in
this case; but such is always the custom, even in those distant
regions, when it is at all practicable. On our return to Bathurst
we took a letter from Mr. Rotheray to the police-magistrate at
Carcoar relative to the case, as it is necessary to register all
deaths in the colony, as in England.</p>

<p>Passing through Carcoar on our way back to Bathurst we had an
opportunity of seeing that township by daylight. It is situated in
a valley, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills, with the Belubula
stream running through it, which at times is of considerable size.
It is 144 miles from Sydney, and has some very good houses in it,
with a neat church just newly built. Altogether it is a very pretty
place; and if this gold-discovery does not draw away its male
population from their industrial pursuits, there is every
probability of its growing into a considerable village. Ten miles
from Carcoar you come to a capital roadside inn&mdash;"the Fitzroy
Hotel," named after his excellency the governor, Sir Charles
Fitzroy. It is a substantial brick building, affording good
accommodation to the traveller, and situated on King's Plains, in
the county, and 21 miles from the town of Bathurst. These plains
are broad and of considerable length, and composed of rich
agricultural soil, if we may judge from the abundance of wheat and
other descriptions of grain produced upon them. There are more
small paddocks under cultivation here than are generally seen in
the same space upon these high lands. Here, as at other places of a
like kind, the men had left their corn-fields for the gold-fields,
which are not many miles from their neighbourhood: there are
greater chances, however, of their returning to reap their harvest
at such a spot than at others more distant and less fertile.</p>

<p>After crossing King's Plains, journeying eastward, the road
passes over an indifferent hilly country, until you come upon the
border of Bathurst Plains; but even these are thinly grassed,
although they feed an immense number of sheep. Within about six
miles of the town of Bathurst, on this road, there is a very good
inn, called the Marlborough Arms, where you meet with civility and
attention,&mdash;matters of importance to the traveller in these
independent times, when "Jack is as good as his master."</p>

<p>Returned to Bathurst, we resolved upon resting for a day or two
before we started on our tour again, not so much for our own
benefit as that of our poor horses. In passing through the town we
met with an old friend in the person of the police-magistrate,
Major Wentworth, formerly of the 62d Regiment, and brother to the
member for Sydney. Having been recently appointed to this office,
he was residing in a temporary abode about two miles from town. We
accompanied him thither to pay our respects to his most agreeable
lady. We found her occupying a small cottage, and attending to her
household duties without any servants to assist her. No doubt this
necessity entailed great inconvenience upon our friends; but Mrs.
Wentworth, like many English ladies under similar circumstances,
made the best of it. Whatever may be the ultimate benefit of this
discovery to the community, it is difficult to determine; in the
meantime, families who have been suddenly deprived of all
attendance find it vastly unpleasant. At the same time, it is
surprising to see how little the industrious lady feels the want;
and we have even heard the servants themselves express their
surprise how well gentlefolks could do without them. The fact is,
that very frequently servants are a great pest; and consequently,
in many instances, we should have nothing to do with them beyond
actual necessity, only for appearance sake, and that we may be in
the fashion with our neighbours. When once, however, the fashion
takes a turn the other way, as it seems to be doing in Australia at
the present time, we may expect to see the laughable travesties of
<i>Punch</i> realised at the antipodes, and the rising generation
of ladies there studying the practice of the washing-tub at school
instead of the piano, and receiving their friends in the kitchen
instead of the drawing-room.</p>

Sydney.</p>

<p>Among the groups of gold-diggers who came into Bathurst from the
diggings far and near, we could distinguish men from all classes of
society, notwithstanding the uniform coarseness of their garb; and
it was amusing to listen to their opinions on the geological
formation of the gold in the earth, some being convinced that it
grew like potatoes. One day we heard an Aberdeen doctor discoursing
very learnedly, as he considered, upon the subject, using some long
technical terms to back his arguments, showing that it was the
easiest thing in the world to know where the auriferous deposits
were, and expressing his surprise that people should find any
difficulty in obtaining the precious metal. He was affecting so
much superiority over others, that a person present was tempted to
ask him how it happened, with all his extraordinary knowledge, that
he had been going over the ground for so many years, and all the
time blind to the existence of these treasures, which he now
asserted were so clear? The learned gentleman was not well pleased
at this interrogatory; he seemed puzzled, and prudently held his
tongue. It stopped him for the time; but no doubt he would assume
again his superiority on the first occasion which offered. As a
general rule, we may fairly conclude, that where there is great
presumption, there is great ignorance, so, on such occasions, we
preferred the opinions of the practical working man to the crude
theories of those who passed themselves off as great lights in
science.</p>

<p>To complete our tour through the gold regions of Australia, we
prepared ourselves to encounter the rough journey before us to the
Louisa Creek, the Meroo Creek, and the World's-end diggings. This
latter name was very appropriate under the circumstances in which
we started; for after visiting such a distant locality, it was time
for us to return from our wanderings. These were the latest
discovered diggings at the time we were in Bathurst; they are
situated about seventy-five miles in a northerly direction from
that town, and the nearest way to them is by passing through the
Turon diggings, thirty-five miles on the road. While sauntering
among the diggers at this latter place, we met a son of the late
Sir Richard S&mdash;&mdash;r, a midshipman on board one of her
Majesty's ships at Sydney, in company with a brother-in-law of a
member of Parliament. They were in digging costume, and appeared to
be looking about with the intention of entering into the
speculation in a business-like way. Whether they possessed the
strength and perseverance necessary to insure success is a doubtful
question; however, there they were, determined to take their chance
with the others in the golden scramble. During the few days we had
been absent from this river, many hundreds had gone to Louisa
Creek, where, it was reported, there were much richer gold-fields.
We resolved, therefore, notwithstanding the badness of the weather,
to visit that locality on the following day.</p>

<p>We started, although it was pouring with rain, proposing to
ourselves to stop for the night about two miles along the road at
the station of Mr. Richards, who, we were informed, did not object
to receive strangers. Upon our arrival there, we however found
ourselves misinformed on this head; for Mr. Richards entertained no
such idea. He would not suffer us even to take shelter in a hovel;
we therefore had no other alternative but to proceed in spite of
the fury of the elements. Thanks to our oilskin cloaks and leather
overalls, we were able to keep ourselves comparatively dry. It is
not usual in New South Wales to be refused the hospitality of a
settler's station; but the multitudes passing to and fro fatigued
and alarmed this person, who, though he was coining money by
selling his sheep at high prices for food to the diggers, yet
affected to be annoyed that his retirement in the mountains should
be invaded. These parties should adopt a custom followed in some
parts of America, where strangers pay a certain well-known
established charge for the night. No doubt Mr. Richards felt that
pressure and necessity for the time being which compelled him to
say "No," except to those individuals with whom he was acquainted,
or who had come upon business which interested him.</p>

<p>We turned from his door with a cheerless feeling, and pursued
our way for eleven long and weary miles, over hills and through
valleys, along the worst of roads, while it rained in torrents all
the way. We were far from being the only party out in this wild
region without shelter in such a dirty night; and, as usual, it
made us more contented with our lot. We met and passed hundreds of
people journeying along to the all-attractive gold-fields: men,
women, and children, all were thoroughly drenched. Some were in
wagons and drays, others on foot and on horseback; many of the
former were stuck in the mud, and some broken down altogether. Here
parties were unloading, and taking only one-half of the load up the
hills at a time, when they would return for the other half,
patiently and contentedly. There were other parties in search of
cattle that had strayed from their bivouac; whilst some were
seeking their horses, which they suspected had been
<i>borrowed!</i> Night setting in just as we met two gentlemen in a
similar predicament with ourselves, we resolved to bivouac
together, before it was too dark to select a proper place. These
gentlemen had come from beyond Maitland; each of them led a horse,
and they said they were in advance of their party some days, who
were coming on with wagons of provisions. The night was stormy; but
nevertheless we made it out pretty well.</p>

<p>On the following morning we proceeded to Warragunya, about three
miles farther on, a station belonging to Mr. Suttor, and situated
on Crudine Creek&mdash;a tributary of the Turon&mdash;which is
joined here by Cunningham's River. The storekeeper at this station
is a native of Nottinghamshire; he was one of those men who were
compelled to leave France during the Revolution of 1848, and whom
the British Government assisted to emigrate to this favoured land.
His wife, a native of France, though born of English parents, is a
most interesting woman. They are, indeed, a contented couple; and
it was quite refreshing to hear them speak in grateful terms of the
considerations extended to them by their country. A son of theirs,
a smart boy, accompanied us on the road towards Pyramul, another
station of Mr. Suttor's, which lay on our road. By the road it is
sixteen miles in a circuitous route round the base of the
mountain-ranges between the two stations; whereas it is not more
than eight miles by a bush-track across them, as the crow flies.
We, having the advantage of the boy for a couple of miles to put us
in sight of a certain high mountain, as a guide to our path,
preferred taking the shorter route of the two. The mountain proved
to be of steep ascent, attaining a great altitude above the
surrounding country. However, we surmounted it without any great
difficulty, the directions to follow being clearly given; so we
arrived safely and in good time at Pyramul. The view from the
summit was very grand and extensive; we could see Crown ridge near
Keening's, twenty miles off, and other high and distant mountains.
We proceeded on our journey very slowly, occasionally leading our
horses up the steep ascent, and stopping to pick up specimens of
the rocks; amongst these we were successful in finding a few
tolerably good ones, with gold in them. There is no doubt as to the
whole of this region being more or less rich in gold-quartz veins
and auriferous alluvium. The shepherds on this "run" are always on
the look-out for the precious metal in their daily rambles, and not
one of them but had gold in his possession. They spoke of their
employer, Mr. Suttor, with great respect; they called him a fair
man to labouring people; which in these times is a character of
great value for a master who wishes to retain, his men.</p>

<p>As we approached Pyramul, we were surprised to see a flock of
sheep under the care of a young woman, the first shepherdess we had
met upon our travels. Her father, she told us, had gone to Louisa
Creek with some neighbours, and left her in charge of the flock.
They had been very successful, getting some days as much as seven
ounces among four of them. It was well for this young woman that
the natives had been subdued in this locality, otherwise they would
have made sad havoc amongst her flock. Our road, as we neared our
destination, lay over high and rugged mountains, and often through
those dense thickets, termed "scrubs" by the colonists; neither of
which, nor the prospect before us, was at all encouraging; for it
appeared to us almost a certainty when we arrived that we should
not be able to procure any thing to eat, nor find accommodation of
any sort to protect either ourselves or horses from the inclemency
of the weather. Regular gold-diggers, of course, provide against
such contingencies; we took our chance. The heavy rains had made
the road almost impassable for drays; and we met many returning to
the Turon in a bad plight. The unloading and reloading, which is
necessary to get these drays over the stony parts of the road, and
drag them out of the mire, are some of the disagreeable realities
which do away with the romance of the occupation to the intending
gold-digger, even before he reaches the enchanted spot. Hence many
a townsman, unused to the exigencies of a bush life, becomes sick
of this attractive pursuit upon the threshold of the gold-field.
Wet, cold, tired to death, with no other prospect before him but
heavy labourer's work, which he is not equal to, he begins to doubt
whether he has not been making a mistake in giving up a certainty,
amidst the comforts of a town life, for this uncertainty in the
houseless wilderness. Then perhaps he meets a number of
unsuccessful men going back to town, ragged, penniless, and
probably ill; which increases the length of his face, and he feels
an inclination to return with them. But other parties, who have
been successful, coming up, he listens to their flattering
tales&mdash;of their good luck&mdash;how they and a great many more
have made their fortunes. This raises his spirits, and he is once
more all hope; so he proceeds on his way cheerfully, and enters
upon his labours with vigour. If fortune does not favour him, he
either hires himself to others to obtain a living, or he falls back
upon the labour offered by the settler to earn a little money to
speculate again. Or should he have had enough of a gold-digging
life, and return to seek his former occupation, he is fortunate if
he escapes from his toils as sound a man in health as when he
entered upon the tempting speculation, and finds as profitable
employment on his return to town as that which he gave up when he
left.</p>

<p>For several miles before you reach Louisa Creek the country
becomes tolerably level; and as you approach this famous locality
from the south, the first object which attracts your attention is
the quartz lode from whence the enormous mass of one hundred and
six pounds weight of gold was obtained. This giant vein of mineral
quartz crops out from the midst of an alluvial flat to a
considerable height, and forms a striking feature in the landscape.
Louisa Creek is about half a mile below this Nugget-hill, as it is
termed. The water-course near the hummock is called Dirt-hole
Creek, which has yielded a large proportion of the gold from this
locality. The weather was very unfavourable for work during the
short time we remain at Louisa Creek. Gold, however, was being
obtained by some parties in considerable quantities. There may have
been two hundred persons on the ground; few of them were working
with cradles. A number were breaking the quartz on Nugget-hill,
which was strewed about like rock broken for a macadamised road;
and a few were carrying the gold-earth on their backs to the water
to wash it in the stream, which repaid them very well. During all
this time the rain fell in torrents, and every one was thoroughly
drenched; and, as it happened, those who were ill-provided with
tents were not much more exposed to the wet than the possessors of
the best, for it was impossible that any one could have lain down
that night in a dry blanket. Having excellent prospecting hammers
with us, we tried our luck as experimentalists among those who were
breaking the rock at "Nugget-hill,"<a name="nuggethill" id=
"nuggethill"></a>*[see note at the end of <a href=
"#endchapter17">this chapter</a>] and in less than an hour we had
the fortune to find a good specimen with the gold intersecting
it.</p>

<p>Most assuredly had we at that time been free from the commands
of duty, we should have entered into the speculation. On the same
ridge, and very near to the spot where the large mass was found,
another piece of gold-quartz, we were informed, had been dug up,
weighing twenty-seven pounds and a quarter. It was described as
consisting nearly of one-half gold and one-half quartz; the latter
of a beautiful white colour, interspersed profusely with the gold
of the purest quality; and having all the appearance of being
forcibly squeezed together when in a fused state, so as to cause
the gold to protrude on all sides.</p>

<p>The Louisa Creek, the Meroo Creek, and the World's-end diggings
are within a few miles of each other, and about twenty miles from
the town of Mudgee, situated in the county of Wellington, on the
Cudgegong River, one hundred and fifty miles from Sydney. The Meroo
Creek is a tributary of this river, which has upon its banks some
of the richest and most beautiful meadows in the district. Mudgee
is on the south side of the river, and is admirably situated for a
thriving population. Nature has done every thing for this place;
and as it is situated, like Braidwood, near to rich gold-fields,
there is every likelihood of its soon becoming a large town. The
rich agricultural lands by which it is surrounded will furnish
employment and food for a large population; and its position among
the mountains&mdash;which are not too near it&mdash;renders it one
of the healthiest inland towns in the colony. It is in truth a most
picturesque, and altogether a beautiful locality.</p>

<p>Having seen all that was novel and worth observing in these
gold-fields, we retraced our steps. On our way back we noticed that
the country is poorly grassed for horses and sheep in the winter
season, although at other times there is said to be very good feed;
and we may observe that these uplands are well covered with timber.
We rode rapidly past the stations of Pyramid and Warragunya, and we
reached, late at night, a third sheep-station of Mr. Suttor's,
called Redbanks. From here, in a few miles, we came into the Mudgee
road; and then, after passing Cherry-tree Hill, between the Turon
River and Colo Creek, we arrived at Barnaby's inn. The proprietor
of this roadside hostelry has established himself in rather an
extensive valley amongst these mountain-ranges; and he is just the
man to make the most of these golden times. He will soon be out of
his little roadside inn into a much larger one, in which he will be
able to accommodate the thousands who now pass his house on their
way to the Turon. He has also a considerable breadth of land under
cultivation, and he is enclosing more. His proximity to the
gold-fields will enable him, it is probable, to hire as much labour
as he requires among those who have not been successful; and his
greatest gains will be from those who are fortunate. From this spot
to Keening's is several miles, the road passing over the high
mountain we have already mentioned, called Crown Ridge; the view
from which is very wild and picturesque, particularly towards the
ranges where the rocks are of a mural character.</p>

<p>Passing through Mr. Cadell's property in the vicinity of
Keening's inn, we availed ourselves of his hospitable invitation on
our way up to call upon him at Ben Bullen on our return, where we
were most politely received by him and his lady. Ben Bullen is a
pretty spot, and there is every probability of its becoming a
valuable property. There is a good deal of land about it under
cultivation; and as the hungry diggers accumulate at the
neighbouring gold-fields, there will be great inducement to break
up more. We accompanied Mr. Cadell on a tour of inspection to that
part of his sheep-run on the banks of the Turon where there were a
number of diggers at work, and found about a hundred men busily
employed, who were all more or less successful in finding gold; but
a great many had left in consequence of the flood in the river. Mr.
Cadell found that one party had coolly taken possession of a
shepherd's hut, from which he was obliged to eject them; at the
same time the men were civil enough, and hoped, that no mischief
had been done; however it proved the necessity of proprietors of
stations in the vicinity of the gold-fields looking sharp after
their property. On our way to this part of the run we rode through
a rough country, where a tributary creek of the Turon passes
between high and precipitous banks; but on our return by a
different route, we saw some exceedingly good open forest-land
covered with abundance of grass, and fit either for sheep or
cattle. This grass, however, like most of the upland grasses, does
not possess those fattening properties so valuable to the grazier
on the lowlands. On this land excellent limestone has been found,
and some of it which we saw was beautifully grained, like dark
marble, suitable for chimney-pieces and ornamental slabs. Not far
from the house also are several limestone caves, which, in the
bush-ranging days of the colony, were the hiding-places of a band
of daring villains, known by the name of "Jewboy's Gang." The rocks
of which those caves are formed show remarkable imprints on them,
as if they were impressions of human arms and hands, which no doubt
the geologist could trace to those extinct races of animals whose
organic remains have lately been discovered. Epsom-salts have been
found here also in a natural state; in fact, every day brings to
light the hidden mineral resources of this most interesting
country.</p>

<p>Leaving our kind host and hostess to their golden prospects at
Ben Bullen, we passed on to Wallerawang, the estate of James
Walker, Esq. To this gentleman we had a letter of introduction, and
therefore felt rather disappointed to learn that he was absent at
Hartley, fifteen miles distant, attending to his duties as a
magistrate at the court of petty sessions. However, we sent in our
letter to those of the family who were at home, and at once we were
received in that cordial manner which distinguishes so many of the
gentry of Australia, and which, as we have the pleasure of
acknowledging, is often extended to individuals who trespass as
strangers upon their hospitality. Here we met some ladies and
gentlemen from Bathurst, and sat down to a comfortable family
dinner. We were joined by a neighbouring settler, who came in
dressed in complete bush-costume, blue shirt, belt, and
cabbage-tree hat, all complete, as he had just returned from a
"prospecting" tour among the mountains. Some men show their dignity
of bearing under the rudest garb, but we should never have taken
him for a gentleman dressed in the digger's costume.</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Walker returned, and we had the satisfaction of
receiving from him a most hearty welcome. He was apparently much
fatigued; and not being a young man, his duties of attending as a
magistrate at the petty sessions, so far from his residence, he
begins to feel press heavily upon him. He is one of the largest and
most successful sheep-owners in the country: his flocks and herds,
however, are principally on the Castlereagh River, two hundred
miles north from his mountain home at Wallerawang. He is a most
intelligent and pleasant gentleman; one who has seen much of the
world, and in early life had served his country in the American war
as an officer in the marine artillery. In our conversations upon
the unprecedented state of affairs in the colony, he entered into
all the topics which were of general interest with great
earnestness; and it was agreeable to meet with one so fully able to
cope with the questions it gave rise to, and so hopeful in his
arguments for the progress of Australia. To us it was particularly
so, as that progress, in his view, was not in opposition to British
connexion, but in harmony with it. In the evening we were still
further gratified with our call at this delightful mansion by
hearing the ladies discourse sweet music; and we retired to rest
more comfortably than we had done for many nights previously.</p>

<p>On the following day Mr. Campbell, the gentleman from Bathurst,
with his wife and daughter, departed in their carriage. Mr. Walker
having kindly insisted on our remaining, showed us the
improvements, or rather we might say the property, he had made in
this highland valley. The house is of considerable size, and built
in the cottage style, with the most convenient arrangements. It is
situated on a rising ground in the splendid valley of Wallerawang,
which is about three miles wide, and situated in the county of
Cook, on the road to Bathurst, 95 miles from Sydney, at the head of
Cox's River; the surrounding country is mountainous and romantic.
There are some well-enclosed paddocks of excellent soil on the
broad flat lands around the house under cultivation; and the hills
afford ample pasture-grounds for a sheep-run. The air is
delightful, but cold, and like all other parts of this elevated
region, is subject to summer frosts, which do mischief sometimes by
cutting off the young crops. The premises include one of the finest
shearing-sheds, with a wool-press, which we remember to have seen.
The garden is formed in terraces on the side of the hill where the
house is built, and possesses every sort of European fruit-tree,
with flowers of the most familiar kind, and many rare exotics. This
fruit and flower garden is connected with a kitchen-garden on the
opposite side of the stream by a neat bridge thrown across it. A
dam has also been constructed in the bed of the river, which
insures a good supply of water in the driest seasons. Some persons
might object to the situation in which Mr. Walker has built his
house, but this we were not inclined to find fault with; for when
we considered what sort of place it must have been in a state of
nature, we confess that we were so full of admiration at the result
of that gentleman's labours, and seeing the improvements he had
made, that we had no other feeling than one of unmixed
satisfaction, and we fully enjoyed the beauty of all around us.</p>

<p>Once more upon the road we pursued our journey back to Sydney,
passing again through the romantic and beautiful Vale of Clywd,
with its pleasantly situated townships of Bowenfels and Hartley.
The great traffic on the road during the wet weather, which had
continued for some time, rendered it almost impassable in some
places; consequently the carriage of merchandise from Sydney to
Bathurst had reached a most exorbitant sum. On our way down, the
only place we visited worthy of notice which we have not yet
described, is a famous waterfall on the Blue Mountains, situated
off the road about two miles and a half from the "Weatherboard Hut"
inn. Remaining for the night at this place of accommodation, we
rose at daylight next morning, and followed the course of a small
stream from this spot leading to the fall. When we reached a
convenient position, so as to have a glimpse of this mountain
cataract, we were rather disappointed at the small volume of water
it displayed, scarcely sufficient in our estimation to be
considered a waterfall. However, the insignificance of the stream
was amply compensated for in grandeur by the tremendous precipice
over which it fell, not less, we should suppose, than a thousand
feet in height. This precipice forms part of the perpendicular
cliffs which enclose an apparently inaccessible valley, appearing
like a yawning gulf in the bosom of the mountains, which rise in
magnificent grandeur around it. To look over this precipice on the
gloomy vale below makes one feel dizzy, and you shrink back with a
feeling of terror; even the brilliancy of an Australian sun can
scarcely light up the dark shadows which envelope it. Altogether it
is one of the wildest and finest mountain scenes it has been our
fortune ever to have seen, and stands in striking contrast to the
monotonous aspect of Australian scenery generally. We were informed
that no one had yet descended into the valley; of which assertion
we are rather doubtful, when we consider the adventurous character
of the bushmen of the country: no doubt it would be folly, if not
dangerous, to attempt it alone, as it might occupy several days in
accomplishing. The bush-rangers in the early times of the colony
lived in places equally difficult of access. One of these may be
seen after passing the Blue Mountain inn, near to the toll-gate,
where the cave of a noted bush-ranger named King may be seen. This
man committed many robberies on the road, and for a long time
eluded the police, but his retreat was at length discovered, and he
was shot at the entrance of the cave.</p>

<p>Our wearied horses were glad to traverse the level lands on the
east side of this mountain region; and we gave them a long rest and
plenty of provender on our return to Sydney.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#nuggethill">Return to
'Nugget-hill'</a><a name="endchapter17" id="endchapter17"></a>[*
Since we visited this spot, a company has been formed, buildings
erected, and works in full operation for the purpose of reducing
the quartz by machinery, and extracting the gold by chemical means.
A correspondent of the <i>Maitland Mercury</i> gives the following
interesting account of his visit to the scene of operations:<br>
<br>
"Such a day as this not being pleasant to work in, we spent the
afternoon in a visit to the quartz-crushing machine belonging to
the 'Big Nugget Company' which has been for some time at work. This
machine, which goes by steam, is at once simple in its contrivances
and complex in its results, and appears to be as perfect in design
as it is neat in workmanship. It is of colonial manufacture&mdash;a
circumstance which, coupled with the golden purpose that it
promises so efficiently to serve, swelled my heart with as much of
the pride of country as in brighter weather the clear Italian skies
of our own Australia are wont to do. As to the profits of the
concern since this giant of skill and power has been employed for
the company, of course I had no means of learning; but judging from
some of the lumps of quartz spangled with gold which I saw ready to
be placed under the pestle of the machine, I should be inclined to
augur favourably. This quartz, of which a considerable quantity was
heaped up in the spare corners of the apartment, had previously
been reduced by manual labour to small fragments of from four
inches diameter downwards. In this state it is thrown into a square
iron hopper, in which a ponderous pestle descends upon it
perpendicularly, with astonishing rapidity and force. When
comminuted sufficiently by this part of the process, the stuff
finds its way, by a simple and effective contrivance, into a
circular compartment, about eighteen feet in circumference, within
which two immense iron rollers revolve, something like our planet
the earth&mdash;to compare the products of human skill with the
grander scale of Nature&mdash;one revolution of each being on its
own axis, whilst each more slowly describes the circuit of the
compartment. The rollers, if you will allow me the expression,
appear to have different <i>orbits</i>, so that nearly the whole
area of the compartment is subjected to their crushing march;
whilst, accompanying their wider revolution, skimmers of sheet-iron
project forward at an angle outwardly and inwardly, and, just
brushing the surface, scrape every thing within the pathway of the
wheels with a precision that almost seems instinct with
intelligence and life. The pounded quartz is then as fine as flour,
which it much resembles. You may judge of its fineness when I
assure you that the impalpable dust produced by the operation
powders the heads of the workmen like millers. This accumulating
heap of quartz-flour, however, is made to relieve itself of any
superfluity by falling in proper time and state into a kind of
cistern, through the centre of which a wheel with a strap studded
at intervals with small tin buckets moves simultaneously with
another wheel about twelve feet overhead, around which the
bucket-studded strap before mentioned also turns, bringing the
buckets up full out of the cistern, and discharging their contents
into a proper receptacle in its downward course for more. The stuff
is then conveyed of itself into a quicksilver amalgamating
apparatus, which is supplied with water by the same motive power.
This apparatus is very complicated in appearance, having a
multiplicity of small cylinders which spread along the surface of
the tray containing the watering mixture, and dip to their axles
into it. Each of the cylinders is lined horizontally on the outside
with an infinity of small blade-like cogs, and with these they play
into each other with wonderful celerity and harmony, impelled by a
corresponding series of small cog-wheels stretching along the
outside of the tray and attached to the axles of the cylinders. A
lively commotion, as you may suppose, is thus kept up in the
paste-like stream during its transit through the tray. It then
passes into another tray, which has a number of stops forming
separate compartments. In this tray there is no motion beyond that
produced by an inclination of about five degrees in the tail of the
tray, over which the refuse stream passes so sluggishly that it
seems, in fancy's eye, to be conscious of having been robbed of its
treasures.<br>
<br>
I have thus attempted to convey to such of your readers as may not
have witnessed quartz-crushing operations, some faint idea of the
admirable process. I was much gratified by the inspection, and
grateful to the officers of the company for the ready permission to
examine every thing which they favoured us with. I should have
wished to pry more particularly into all the minutiae of the
concern; but one does not like to risk being troublesome, or to
appear too inquisitive. Although admiration is the first emotion
one must experience and express on taking a survey of what this
genuine, <i>bonâ-fide</i> quartz-crushing company has already done,
another, yet a kindred feeling, in which every honest heart and
candid mind, after such a sight, must participate, will prompt the
earnest wish&mdash;that prosperity may attend the Big Nugget
Quartz-crushing Company; and, <i>advance Australia!</i>"</p>

GOLD-DISCOVERY.</h2>

<p>Not only the fact of the great discovery of gold in Australia
took the world by surprise, but as that discovery will act upon all
interests throughout every nation, in consequence of a greater
circulating medium being created, men are feverish as to the
probable consequences of a gift by a bounteous Providence to
counteract the errors of man. Perhaps, therefore, it may not be
uninteresting to many, if we say a little relative thereto.</p>

<p>Gold had been found by shepherds, and others in a similar
condition of life, in various districts of New South Wales from
time to time; and Sir Roderick Murchison, it appears, specially
called the attention of the Government of New South Wales, some
years since, to the fact that the geological formation of the Main
Range, or Australian Cordillera, strongly resembled that of the
Ural Mountains, and therefore recommended a search for gold and the
other metals which are found in the latter range. Notwithstanding,
however, these indications, the world, as we have stated, heard
with astonishment of the discovery; and it is astounded at the vast
quantities embodied in that land; and it will concede to Mr.
Hargreaves the merit of possessing that practical common sense in
prosecuting his successful researches, which, in all time, when it
has a fair field, will prove itself advantageous to mankind.</p>

<p>This discovery has brought together large masses of people; and
it will attract multitudes from the United Kingdom, and other
countries, to that portion of our empire. It is now a matter of
history that immense amounts of gold have already been procured;
and as every arrival brings intelligence of new discoveries, some
of which are of a richness far exceeding any hitherto known, even
those of California, there can now be no doubt that this gold
exists in the extensive regions of Australia to an amount it is
impossible for us to estimate. It may therefore not be
uninteresting to many persons to have the opportunity of forming
their own opinions upon a matter of this kind, and to a certain
extent upon the character of the population, by giving some further
information connected with this most interesting discovery; a
discovery which it is our hope may be so used as to be of great
advantage to the colonies, and a rich inheritance to the British
people throughout the world.</p>

<p>We have already given details of various localities; we shall
now, therefore, confine ourselves to general remarks, submitting
such views as we think necessary for the occasion.</p>

<p>The formation or substratum in the localities in which gold is
found differs greatly: sometimes, as at Araluen Creek, it is all
granite gold; unlike that of the Turon and Ophir, which is
associated chiefly with schistose* and quartzose** rocks; the
granite, however, being throughout of trappean*** character. Then,
again, at Frederick Valley, it will be remembered, specimens were
obtained by Mr. Hargreaves of auriferous ore consisting of
ferruginous rock, beautifully dotted with globules of gold,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Schistose, having a slaty structure.]<br>
<br>
[** Quartzose, containing quartz as a principal ingredient.]<br>
<br>
[*** Trap is a dark-greenish or brownish-black rock, heavy and
tough. It is an intimate mixture of felspar and hornblende. It is
often called greenstone.]</p>

<p>The regions wherein gold is found extend from Wide Bay, in lat.
26° S. to Port Philip, a distance of at least 800 miles, with a
width varying from 50 to 200 miles. Further discoveries may, and
probably will, increase the area to an extent it would be bold
indeed to limit. Throughout the whole of this tract there are
numerous streams and water-courses, which have their sources in
mountain-ranges running parallel to the eastern coast; and also in
high lands, distinct and distant from those mountains, gold is
found in vast quantities. These streams are the sources of rivers
which have cut their channels through the ranges; some of them
flowing to the west, and swelling the water of the Murray to a
mighty stream; others, again, flowing to the east, forming the
Shoalhaven River and other streams. The gold-bearing quartz does
not cover in any locality the entire face of the country. In some
parts there is scarcely any; but most frequently it intersects the
rocks in large veins in various directions. It is also found in
masses and small fragments on the surface, and seen along the
ravines and in the mountains overhanging the river in the hill-side
in its original beds. It crops out again in the valleys and on the
tops of the hills, and forms a striking feature of the entire
country over which it extends.</p>

<p>How this gold has been produced it is hard to say; it is a
question upon which men have, and will ever differ. That it is
found in enormous quantities, and in various localities, and in
different combinations, is a fact. Nevertheless an idea has been
expressed, which we think deserves attention,&mdash;that whether in
detached particles, in nuggets, or in veins, gold has been
generated in quartz, as it is the most extensive matrix producing
it. The localities in which it is found show that it occurs on the
surface within a few inches, and many feet below it; presenting in
the former case the appearance of having been detached from the
matrix, thrown up and scattered in all directions by some great
agency.</p>

<p>The rivers, in forming their channels, or breaking their way
through the hills, have come in collision with the quartz
containing the gold veins; and by constant attrition have abraded
the decomposed part of the quartz, or gravel, from the gold,
whether in nuggets or flakes, or in dust, taking away the rubbish
reduced to mud, leaving the heavy metal at the bottom. Likewise, in
some of those places where the velocity and strength of the water
in a flood was great, some gold may have been, and probably was,
hurried down the streams, through narrow ravines and gullies, with
the rubbish, and distributed over banks, where a wider margin is
found on each side; over which the water rushes now, during the wet
seasons, with great force: the same process, no doubt, has been
going on for ages.</p>

<p>If so heavy a metal as gold has been swept down the streams into
the beds of the larger rivers, they must be very rich. As the
velocity of some of the creeks is greater than others, so is the
gold found in fine or coarse particles, apparently corresponding to
the degree of attrition to which it has been exposed. The water
from the hills and upper valleys, in finding its way to the rivers,
has cut deep ravines; and whenever it came in contact with the
quartz, trappean, or granite matrix, it has dissolved or crumbled
them, and left the particles of gold free. In the dry season these
channels are generally without water, even in holes; and during the
wet seasons they do not always run. Gold is found in the beds and
on the margin of many of them in large quantities, but in a much
coarser state than on the banks of rivers; owing, we conceive, to
the comparatively moderate flow and temporary continuance of the
water, which reduced it to a smooth surface, not unlike pebbles;
but the stream evidently had not sufficient force to reduce it to
flakes or dust. On this point, however, as on every other, people
differ; and the fact of finding finer gold in the rivers is stated
as a proof that it has been washed down from the higher lands.</p>

<p>The dry diggings are those places where quartz containing gold
has cropped out on the surface, and been disintegrated, crumbled to
fragments of pebbles and dust, by the action of water, the
atmosphere, or some other cause. The gold has been left, as it was
originally formed, in all imaginable shapes, in pieces of all
sizes, from one grain to several pounds weight. The evidences of
its formation in quartz as its matrix are very numerous; perhaps,
as in granite, every sort of quartz may not possess the property of
such production. We have seen pieces of gold free from quartz or
any impurity; but these must have been detached by some means from
the quartz matrix. In many specimens the particles of gold are so
minute, that they cannot be separated from the quartz without
pulverising the whole, and then subjecting it to the action of
quicksilver. These dry diggings in some places spread over valleys
of great width, and on the sides and also summits of the hills. The
latter occurs to a greater extent at Mount Alexander and Friar's
Creek than at any of the other gold-fields; though we saw many
places which, from the external appearance, promised to be equally
rich.</p>

<p>It is most probable that the gold in the dry diggings, and that
in the beds of the rivers and creeks, is at great depths: the
former in lumps, or coarse, the latter generally in dust, or finer,
have one common origin. That which is found in the rivers has
undoubtedly been worn from the veins in the rocks or other
substances with which gold was mixed, and with which the strong and
constantly running streams have come in contact for ages. Almost
all the gold-fields are sufficiently rich to pay for working, and
some of them to a degree that is most startling; to attempt,
therefore, to form an opinion of the probable amount of treasure in
these gold regions would be vain: we are of opinion that its
development is only beginning.</p>

<p>To regulate this matter properly, so that the empire may be
benefited by the discovery, will be a subject for very grave
consideration; and most anxious must her Majesty's government be to
adjust all interests, so as to secure the hearty goodwill of the
mass of the people. The gold-diggers labour under an idea that the
government are jealous of them; and when the governor and council
of Victoria proposed to raise the license-fee from thirty shillings
to three pounds a month, it is much easier to imagine than to
describe the discontent that showed itself. At Mount Alexander,
indeed, the symptoms of insubordination were so great and so
threatening that the government deemed it prudent to give way. The
people have had it suggested to them, that it is their right to
work for gold; that to deprive them of that right would be a
grievous wrong: without, however, entering into that question of
right, practically the government, if it could, would have great
difficulty in preventing the people from working. The gold-fields
are not only too extensive, but a large portion of the auriferous
soil is in private property; and it is to us very doubtful if
government could enforce any regulations contrary to what the
people considered fair. Troops have been suggested; but the
employment of soldiers in such a service, otherwise than as
protectors of the industry of the people, would not only be odious
in their view, but ineffectual in enforcing unpopular regulations;
they would be more likely to set an example of insubordination than
to compel obedience in others. In New South Wales there are not
wanting, men ready to suggest violent steps; and separation from
the mother country would be the cry. The entire freedom and
independence of Australia is already publicly averred by some
parties; any false step, therefore, in this matter would
consequently be seized upon with eagerness by those discontented
men who have ulterior views.</p>

<p>Repeating, therefore, that no system which is not in accordance
with the interests of the mass of the people can be carried into
successful operation, it should be considered fortunate when laws
can be so framed as to harmonise these interests with the policy
and duty of the local government; and being of opinion that the
case might be met, and seeing that the government of Victoria was
in a difficulty,&mdash;as shown by its rescinding its
orders,&mdash;we ventured to submit the following memorandum on the
question for the consideration of the lieutenant-governor while we
were in Melbourne:</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"1st, That an annual license should be
issued by the government; which license to dig for gold should be
good for nine months; and for which license a sum of one pound
alone should be paid.<br>
<br>
"2d, If any man should dig for gold any portion of the remaining
three months necessary to secure the harvest and clip of wool, he
should be charged for each month twelve pounds for the permission
to dig.<br>
<br>
"3d, The government should be the purchaser of the gold, for which
it should give three sovereigns, or three pieces of gold, each of
the value of a sovereign; or six pieces of the value of a
half-sovereign each; or twelve pieces of the value of a
quarter-sovereign each; and some five-sovereign pieces might be
issued. It is true that the right to coin is in the Crown; but to
meet the necessity of the case, in the absence of any precedent,
you should go back to first principles.<br>
<br>
"4th, The tokens, or pieces of gold, to be a legal tender, and
received by the government in discharge of taxes and in all
transactions in the colony, until the question is finally
settled.<br>
<br>
"5th, Private persons buying gold to be liable to seizure, unless
they pay ten per cent on the amount to government.<br>
<br>
"Such a system would benefit not only the gold-diggers, but every
class in the community, as it would, by adding to the circulating
medium, benefit all and every class, and so help industry in all
its various ramifications, whether in town or country; whereas the
present system will not only be disadvantageous to the
gold-diggers, but it must injure all interests; and it places the
government, which can alone have the interest of the community at
heart, in a wrong position with the people; and every system would
be prejudicial to the community which did not add to the
circulating medium; for instance, an export-duty would do
mischief.<br>
<br>
"To the gold-diggers this system would be advantageous, because
they would get fair value for their gold; whereas now some of these
hard-working men have been compelled in their necessity to sell
their gold for 2<i>1</i>. 17<i>s</i>., and many for 2<i>l</i>.
10<i>s</i>. an ounce, and they will probably have to submit to much
lower prices.<br>
<br>
"To the merchant and to those engaged in trade it would be
advantageous; because their interests would be attended to, and
they would be able therefore to meet the increased demands upon
their purses for labour.<br>
<br>
"The present system, by decreasing or not adding to the circulating
medium, must injure all those numerous classes not engaged in
successful digging or immediately connected with the diggers.<br>
<br>
"British subjects alone to possess the privilege of digging under
such regulations."</p>

<p>Many persons properly jealous of the interference of the
government in mercantile speculations may be opposed to the above;
but if such individuals reflect a moment, they will see that there
is no interference whatever proposed. It is said, that on gold
being taken to the mint sovereigns are given for it at its value
without any deduction whatever; and why, therefore, should a
different rule be observed with regard to gold dug by individuals
out of its natural bed upon British territory? Our answer is, that
gold thus obtained belongs of right to the government&mdash;that
is, to the public at large; that, therefore, a royalty, as it is
termed, is due, or claimed by the government as trustees for that
public: no one in New South Wales or Victoria that we ever heard
disputed this. The question is, how to obtain this royalty:
directly from the miners when working in small parties, impossible;
indirectly we conceive possible, and in some way that would be of
the greatest public advantage.</p>

<p>It is clear that extra disbursements must fall upon the colonial
treasury by reason of this new development of the country's
resources. Whence are the funds to be obtained for all the various
increased charges of police and defence, internal and external? If
not from the gold, they must come from the general revenue of the
colony, or from England, for the maintenance of an increased force
of soldiers, ships of war, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This measure is more and more proper for government
interference, from the circumstance that the banks in Australia
have, it is said, determined not to advance any more of their funds
upon gold operations. If this should be a permanent rule, the
effect would be to throw the gold-diggers into the hands of the
capitalists: these men must sell their gold to live; and it
requires no great foresight to see, that though the measure would
be of great service to monied speculators, yet that it would be
most disadvantageous to the public generally. Gold is either
merchandise, or it is not; it is either an exception to the
principles which govern mercantile operations, or it is not. If it
is merchandise, it should be treated as such in every respect, and
be entitled to advances from the banks as upon wool, tallow, or any
other colonial produce. The bankers have no right to consider the
effect; that is the province of, and duty of the government to the
people at large. This very act of the banks appears to us a proof
that gold, used as it is, is different from all other merchandise,
and therefore not within the rules that govern mercantile
operations. Consequently there would be no departure from principle
in establishing the propositions submitted in our memorandum. We
believe that some regulations based upon these principles would be
received as a boon, and afford protection to the interests of the
great body of the people; and if we are not mistaken, they would be
not only found to work most advantageously for the miners, but all
other interests, both local and general, would be greatly benefited
by the possession of that which, according as it may be used, will
be either a blessing or a curse to the people possessing it. From
our own experience, we have observed, that while every British
subject at the mines is aware he is upon government property, yet
he would consider any attempt to drive him away as an act of
oppression; but though this is his opinion, we have heard hundreds
of them say, that something should be paid for the privilege of
digging; and they would, therefore, willingly pay a reasonable sum
for such privilege, and for protection in the exercise of it: and
we believe that the government might calculate on the great mass
supporting a system which would do justice to the community and
empire at large.</p>

<p>The revenue collected in the manner alluded to from this source,
we consider, would be greater than under the present system; the
first charge upon which, after expenses of collection, should be
for such police and military as might be necessary for order and
security. Secondly, a suitable amount should be expended in the
construction of roads and bridges, to facilitate communication to
and through the mining districts. And the third item for the
support of ministers of religion at the mines, and such objects as
may be proper to attend to for the general good and protection of
the gold-diggings.</p>

<p>Our reason for submitting that British subjects alone should
possess the privilege of digging under such regulations is, that
these mines belong to, and in our judgment they should be preserved
for the use and benefit of, the British people throughout our
extended empire. If foreigners become citizens of the empire, their
rights would commence. Such a principle acted upon would be
understood by our people, and they would estimate it.</p>

<p>Under this system of a small annual license the labouring man
would see that the government was not jealous of him working at
this lucrative employment on his own account; whereas his view is,
that a high license is intended to prevent him working at all. This
system, therefore, would have their cordial support; and such
support would be of infinite service to the government, in
excluding from the mines all those not entitled to work, or to whom
does not belong the right to be there from any other cause. This
would check desertions among the military and men-of-war's men;
sailors belonging to the mercantile marine would not receive the
encouragement they now do to run away from their vessels as soon as
they cast anchor in port; and which, if some measures to meet the
probable difficulties that threaten to arise are not devised, will
be disastrous to the commerce of the country.</p>

<p>We conceive that under such regulations many of the emigrants
would remain and form a resident population; and that there would
be thousands of young and middle-aged working-men from all parts of
the empire continually resorting to the mines under such
regulations, for the purpose of obtaining the means to establish
themselves in some of the steadier pursuits in the colony; and it
is probable, that as soon as they had secured a sufficient sum for
this purpose, they would return from the mines, leaving room for
others to go and do the same.</p>

<p>Independently of these considerations, an annual license, such
as suggested, would prevent many sad results attending upon the
monthly system of collection. Having nine months' privilege to dig
for so moderate a sum, few men would risk their health to remain
exposed to the inclemency of the season, whether from cold, rain,
or heat, as they now do; and thus we think that a small annual
license would be conducive to the health of the people.</p>

<p>Nothing would surprise us less than to hear of dreadful
sufferings at the mines, occasioned in a great degree by the poor
man continuing at his labours exposed to every hardship after
having paid for one monthly license, and not possessing means to
pay for another without digging successfully for more gold. But
independently of this consideration, we have very great doubts
whether the small annual license would not produce as much revenue
as the present monthly one, as it is more than probable that every
man, woman, and lad would take it out; and the government, both as
a purchaser of gold, and as the recipient of its royalty in the
shape of ten per cent, would be in funds sufficient to meet all
charges occasioned by the gold discovery, and thus be enabled to do
its duty to the advantage of the public and to its own honour.</p>

<p>A mint upon the principle we have submitted would spread life
and activity not only throughout the colonies, but extend its
benefits to many other British interests. The present mode of
sending the gold in mass to England will prevent to a certain
extent the evil consequences attendant upon the money legislation
of late parliaments; but the system here submitted, we presume,
would not only have that effect, but it would further the
prosperity of all British institutions at home and abroad, and be
the means of developing some national interests but little
considered in remote places, by reason of making the circulating
medium throughout the British world abundant. It has been the
absence of a circulating medium&mdash;which is the life of the body
politic&mdash;in sufficient abundance to meet the wants of our
extended empire, that has occasioned so much mischief of late
years. These gold-discoveries have given to the world that which
the wit of man failed to provide; and therefore, as we do not doubt
but that the gold-mines are inexhaustible, we look forward
hopefully.</p>

district&mdash;Return by steamboat to Sydney.</p>

<p>Having thus completed our tour through the gold-regions of this
wonderful land, we shall now give some account of our travels in
other portions of the colony, where the resources of the country,
though not equal in point of commercial wealth to the
gold-districts, still possess what is of vast importance to the
rapidly-increasing community on these shores&mdash;a prolific soil,
capable of raising food for the millions who, in the course of
time, will populate the country. To be in New South Wales and not
to visit the district of Illawarra would render incomplete our
sketches of the agricultural lands of the colony; under any
circumstances, therefore, we had determined to see that district.
And having seen it, we consider&mdash;what is not common&mdash;that
the reports relative to its fertility and picturesque beauty are
not exaggerated. Our route from Sydney was, however, rather
circuitous for ordinary travelling, nevertheless it took us through
some interesting country; and although it rather wearied us in the
accomplishment, we hope not to weary our readers, as we shall trot
briskly over it.</p>

<p>The commencement of our journey was up the Parramatta River,
leaving Darling Harbour in the <i>Emu</i> steamboat. It was a
splendid morning when we started, and very warm. The boat was well
filled with passengers; and a great number of people were assembled
on the Phoenix wharf to see us start. The trip to Parramatta is a
favourite excursion with the inhabitants of Sydney; consequently
you frequently meet with pleasure-parties on board the steamboats
plying between the two places. Soon after leaving Darling Harbour
you pass Goat Island,&mdash;where the powder-magazine is
built,&mdash;and Cockatoo Island&mdash;where the government are
cutting a dry-dock, for the convenience of repairing ships. Passing
the latter island you enter the Parramatta River; on either side of
which, for several miles, you pass beautiful bays and rocky
headlands, studded over with residences of all shapes and sizes,
from the humble cottage to the mansion. As the steamboat proceeds,
you see cultivated grounds and gardens on both banks of the river,
and occasionally an orange-grove close to the water's edge on the
north shore. On the left or south side of the river the stranger
cannot but help noticing extensive salt-works erected on the bank,
and on the rising ground near to them a mansion; that is Newington,
the residence of Mr. Blaxland, whose father was the first English
gentleman of property that settled in New South Wales. His widow, a
lady much respected in the colony, had lately paid the debt of
nature; and as she possessed the love of her family and the esteem
of her friends, the sorrow for her loss was sincere. The present
proprietor is a gentleman of that active and intelligent character
whose labours in his own undertakings have proved a boon to the
community: may that success attend in which they say belongs alone
to the fortunate!</p>

<p>We arrived at Parramatta in good time; and as we have already
described it, we will not tire the reader with any further remarks.
The distance from here to Windsor, whence our steps were now
directed, is twenty miles. The country all the way is well
enclosed; but not by any means of such a good character as we
expected. On the roadside and near thereto are many farm-houses and
several tolerably good inns. We have no doubt but that much of this
country may one day be made available for agricultural purposes;
not, however, so long as better land can be easily obtained
elsewhere. It is hilly, with iron-bark trees
abundant&mdash;vindicating poor soil&mdash;some tea-tree scrubs on
marshy land, and, generally speaking, it is said to be badly
watered. Boxhill, belonging to the late Samuel Terry, is the
most-improved and best-managed estate on the road; opposite which
is Riverstone, the property of the late Sir Maurice O'Connell, who
was commander of the forces in New South Wales.</p>

<p>As you approach Windsor the aspect of the country becomes more
open, and shows greater signs of fertility as you near the banks of
the Hawkesbury River. The town is situated upon a rising ground at
the confluence of the South Creek with that river, which at this
spot, and for several miles higher up, is of sufficient depth to
float vessels of 100 tons and upwards. Windsor is thirty-five miles
distant from Sydney by land, and about 160 miles by water; from
this circumstance there is not much traffic on this noble stream
between it and the capital of the colony. The population of the
town of Windsor before the gold-discovery was about 1800; and it
possesses 450 houses, many of them well built of stone and brick,
with public buildings and places of worship equal to any in
Parramatta. Besides which there are several large and excellent
inns; and we can recommend that kept by Richard Ridge, where the
traveller is certain of receiving great civility and good treatment
for himself and horses. In the vicinity of the town there is a
great quantity of good land; and in this respect it has many
advantages over the neighbouring towns. Altogether, from its
position and resources, this should be a stirring place of
business; but looking at it as it is, one has some doubts whether
it will recover the desertion of its inhabitants. And we are
tempted to question the propriety of congratulating New South Wales
on the gold-mines which nature has so lavishly bestowed upon her,
when we see such thriving towns as this suddenly depopulated by
their influence.</p>

<p>Near Windsor are many vineyards, where the soil and situation
are well adapted for the growth of the vine. We had the pleasure of
being introduced to Mr. Hall, of &mdash;&mdash;, who has been very
successful in producing good samples of wine, both red and white.
And we will venture to give an opinion, that this gentleman's name,
if he is able to stand his ground, will be well known beyond New
South Wales. He superintends the making of his wines and
cultivating the vines himself; and therefore he knows for a
certainty that the wine is the produce of those vines they are
presumed to be; and of course he is enabled to form correct
opinions of their quality. Not far from Mr. Hall's is another
vineyard upon a small farm tenanted by two Frenchmen. We were
particularly struck with the industry of these men, and the order
and cleanliness about their dwellings&mdash;a pattern to many of
our careless countrymen in these colonies. They had every thing
about them that was useful, both for farming operations as well as
those for making wine, including proper cellars for keeping it when
made. We thought that the legislature of the colony might be doing
a benefit to other wine-growers by taking some sensible notice of
these men and their vineyard. More could be learned from a view of
their little farm and arrangements in the practical culture of the
vine than by reading any number of treatises on the subject.</p>

<p>From Windsor we crossed the country in a southerly direction,
until we reached the village of St. Mary's on the great western
road, four miles from Penrith. On our way we crossed the Richmond
road, about sixteen miles from Parramatta, and eight from St.
Mary's. The country generally is heavily timbered with the
iron-bark tree, a little distance from the water-courses; with here
and there tea-tree brush. At the South Creek there are some fine
farms; and when there was labour to be had in this part of the
country, heavy crops must have been raised upon them to support
such large establishments as we saw, judging from the granaries,
and other buildings, most of which are now next to being
unoccupied. The property on the South Creek is in the occupation of
Mr. Lamb, a Sydney merchant, and a member of the legislative
council for that city. On it there is a residence of the first
class, suitable for a gentleman with a large income. From this
place to St. Mary's there is only a bush-road, not very easy for
strangers to make out. The mountains in the distance give a
character to this locality which is quite enlivening. In this
district the timber on the different properties is beginning to be
valuable; and at certain seasons there is good feed for sheep and
cattle on the back lands.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when we arrived at St. Mary's, distant from
Sydney twenty-nine miles on the great western road. It is a long
straggling village, possessing a very pretty little church, two
very good inns&mdash;that at which we put up at was most
comfortable&mdash;many nice snug-looking cottages, and some good
gardens. The proprietor of the land on which it is built, the late
Sir Maurice O'Connell, thought the beauty of the spot, the quality
of the soil, and the advantage of a plentiful supply of water,
together with the great western road passing through it, sufficient
to lay out the plan of a large town upon the site. Acting upon this
idea without due consideration, he caused the surveyors to lay out
several squares, a market-place, terraces, and streets, and gave
them grand names, so as to hand down to all time his own name and
that of particular individuals. Some sites, however, are only
intended for villages, and that of St. Mary's is one of them; as
such it is a very pretty place. Penrith, on the other hand, which
we noticed on our journey to Bathurst, has the requisites for a
town; and there is every chance of its maintaining its ground in
these days of a migratory population inhabiting the country. In the
vicinity of these townships there are some very fine properties,
and the best of land; among them is the estate of the late Sir John
Jamieson on the banks of the Nepean River. Many proprietors in this
neighbourhood are breaking up their large estates, and letting
small farms to a working tenantry. Should this practice continue,
it cannot fail to be advantageous to the colony generally, as well
as to the proprietors.</p>

<p>From St. Mary's we pursued our journey still towards the south,
crossing the western road, and taking the Bringelly and Penrith
track, passing along it as far as the cow-pastures by various
cross-paths, and at length coming into the Sydney and Camden road,
about two miles from the town of Narellan. The country we passed
through is hilly, and much better grassed than we expected to have
seen. Here and there great improvements had been made by the
settlers; and there were many establishments of apparently
substantial men. On our right, far in the distance, we occasionally
caught a sight of the Blue Mountains; and as we journeyed parallel
with the course of the Nepean River, it was between us and them.
Our impressions were much in favour of the country through which we
were passing; there was a variety of hill and dale that was
pleasing; and near the water-courses there were many really
beautiful spots that appeared to be very good soil. It is true we
were informed that it suffered much from droughts and hot winds;
but not more, we presume, than other places. Altogether this tract
of country is far superior to that between Parramatta and Windsor,
or that between the latter town and Penrith.</p>

<p>On the following day we passed through Campbelltown, distant
about eight miles from Narellan, over a hilly, poor country, partly
under cultivation. That town is situated on the high road from
Sydney to Illawarra, distant thirty-three miles. It lies in a
hollow, and has a poverty-stricken aspect, as well as the
surrounding country, and appears destined, we think, to become
poorer. To Appin, from thence, is ten miles, whither we directed
our steps. The road crosses over some rough hilly country, and then
enters a forest of iron and stringy bark trees; after which it
becomes more open, where you come upon a property going to decay.
Its neat cottage-residence was unoccupied when we passed, the
outhouses going to ruin, and the fences broken down in many places;
leaving the impression that the property was valueless, or that it
had been abandoned for want of labour. Throughout the whole of this
district the latter was the case to a great extent. All able-bodied
men and women had left for the gold-fields: labour, therefore, was
high, and often not to be had at any price. Consequently all works
were put a stop to, and the small holdings mostly deserted. It
saddened us to see so many places, which the labour of man had
subdued, returning to their original wild state. The work of
abandonment has begun in this hitherto industrious land; the
question is, "where will it stop? If the present state of the
labour-market lasts for two or three years, this country will
suffer more from this cause, than persons who make themselves busy
in political matters they do not comprehend have any idea of; and
they will find out that something more than gold is necessary for
the real prosperity of the colonies.</p>

<p>As you enter the embryo town of Appin, the eye is gladdened with
the sight of a number of oak-trees within fences on the borders of
some fields; they looked flourishing and healthy, though the
country was high, and the soil not favourable, as we thought. The
oak grows well at the Cape of Good Hope; and there can be no reason
why it should not succeed in New South Wales, being in the same
latitude, on a similar soil, and in the same hemisphere. It would
be a relief to the eye of the traveller, as it was to us on this
occasion, to meet with the oak-tree more frequently in this colony;
and we think the settlers would feel a pleasure in seeing a tree
that would remind them of their native land. Appin is forty-five
miles from Sydney, where the road to Illawarra crosses Tuggerah
Creek.</p>

<p>To Wollongong from Appin there are three roads: first, the old
one by Jordan's Creek; second, the old Bulli road; and third, the
Richmond new line. We took the first road, as it commenced nearest
to the town, passing by several farms on the way, where much had
been done in the shape of improvements. Passing along for several
miles over a rough country, we arrived at Jordan's Creek, the
descent to which is difficult; and the ascent from it more so, and
not free from danger. It might be possible to get a light cart
across the ravine by the assistance of manual labour; but a dray
with horses or bullocks it would be impossible to get over safely.
At times the water rushes down in a mountain-torrent through its
rocky channel, when neither man nor beast can cross. The sides of
this stream are very rugged and precipitous; and its waters clear,
sweet, and most refreshing. From this creek for nearly twenty miles
the road is over a barren and mountainous country, leading you to
Mount Keera, which overlooks the famed district of Illawarra,
distinguished among the other districts of the colony by the
appropriate term of the "Garden of New South Wales."</p>

<p>From this eminence you command a magnificent prospect of the
Illawarra country. This district&mdash;sometimes called the Five
Islands, from a group of islets off the coast&mdash;is a truly
beautiful, picturesque tract of land, containing 150,000 acres,
measuring about eighteen miles along the coast, and extending
several miles back, where it is bounded by the Illawarra range of
mountains. This range is formed of stupendous mural precipices
trending north and south parallel with the coast-line, and rising
into high table-land to the westward. Of the northern section of
the district you have a commanding prospect as far as the eye can
reach from the spot where the view first bursts upon you.</p>

<p>Mount Keera is 1500 feet above the level of the sea, and
Illawarra lies at its base; therefore the road which winds down the
mountain-side is pretty steep in descending. As you proceed, the
change from sterility in the vegetation to the greatest luxuriance
is very remarkable. In a few minutes almost you are transported
from a barren wilderness to green and luxuriant groves; and water,
of which we could not find a drop from the time we left the Jordan
until we reached Mount Keera, was here found near its summit in a
trickling stream. The country we had traversed between was a
sterile region of sand, on which alone grew dwarf Bottle-brush
(<i>Banksia ericifolia</i>), stunted gum-trees (<i>Eucalyptus
obliqua</i>), and occasionally small tufts of the dry yet beautiful
heaths of Australia (<i>Epacris impressa</i> and <i>E.
speciosissima</i>), with a few specimens of what is called the
native pear-tree of New Holland, from the exact shape its
seed-vessel bears to that fruit, only it is inserted on the stalk
the reverse way. Here, at every step, on descending the mountain
towards Wollongong, the trees are of great magnitude, consisting of
the box, the turpentine, and the fig-tree (<i>Ficus Australis</i>).
The wattle-tree (<i>Acacia dealbata</i>) also scented the air with
its yellow blossoms as we brushed past them; and the tall and
slender cabbage-palms (<i>Corypha Australis</i>) were gracefully
festooned by the vines and creepers which entwined their stems. As
we looked down on the dense masses of foliage which grew in these
"scrubs," we were reminded of a tropical forest's vegetation; and
the idea was heightened by the palm-like fronds of the arborescent
fern-trees (<i>Dicksania antarctica</i>), and the giant trunks of
the magnificent gum-trees (<i>Eucalypti</i>), These were all
clustered together in dense thickets, which the rays of the sun
could but feebly penetrate. In places where the sunlight had shone
upon the earth from the falling of timber, or where it was cleared
by fire, the most luxuriant grass had sprung up.</p>

<p>Directing your attention from these objects to the distant
scenery as you descend, it is very striking, most romantic and
interesting,&mdash;so different from any thing we had seen before
in New South Wales or Victoria. On your right Mount Keebla rises
magnificently, and towers above the range of mountains to the west;
before you, on the plains below, commence the fertile lands of
Illawarra; and on your left, to the eastward, is the boundless
Pacific Ocean, studded with the Five Islands a short distance from
the shore. At the time we descended Mount Keera it was in some
respects unfortunate for us that the weather was hazy, with heavy,
threatening clouds hanging over the mountains,&mdash;at the same
time they threw a grander aspect over the whole scene.</p>

<p>As you continue to descend you find that cultivation has
gradually crept up Mount Keera, and then you come to patches of the
most luxuriant Indian corn. From the aspect of this mount we are of
opinion that it would grow excellent grapes for wine and raisins.
We were informed that coal had been found at its base of
sufficiently good quality to fetch a fair remunerating price in the
Sydney market. Arriving at the foot of the mountain, if you are
proceeding to Wollongong, you must turn to the left: that place,
however, was not yet our destination; we were on our way to Dapto,
a small inland village to the south-west. Lake Illawarra is between
this place and the sea; it is not deep, but it abounds in
fish,&mdash;and they are said to be very fine when in season. There
is the mullet, the bream, blackfish, whiting, schnapper, flathead,
tailor-fish, guard-fish, jew-fish, and some others. In the
tributary creeks to the lake&mdash;which are very
numerous&mdash;there are abundance of eels and small fish. From the
turning off at the road which led down from the mountain, we passed
through a cultivated enclosed country for seven miles. Good roads,
good bridges&mdash;one of them an excellent one&mdash;good houses,
in fact, every thing you saw had the appearance of there being
plenty in the land, and there was an expression of content in every
face we passed.</p>

<p>Before we could get under shelter at our destination the rain
fell in torrents; the clouds, which had looked so threatening all
the afternoon, now burst over the district. We were informed that
these rains are of frequent occurrence; and to them, no doubt, is
to be attributed the great fertility of the land we saw around us.
Night had set in as we arrived at Dapto, where we took up our
quarters at the hostelry of Mr. Brown, under whose roof the
traveller is certain to meet with the best accommodation. This inn
is situated on Mullet Creek, which derives its name from the
abundance and goodness of that fish caught in its waters. We were
informed by Mr. Brown that his house was thirty miles from Appin;
which, added to the twenty miles from Narellan to that town, from
whence we had started in the morning, made our day's journey fifty
miles,&mdash;which is considered good travelling over such a
mountainous country. But we must inform the reader that it was our
good fortune to meet with an Illawarra farmer, Mr. Evan
Evans&mdash;a native of Devonshire, a very intelligent, and, we
heard, a successful man&mdash;who accompanied us from there; and
travelling with one so well accustomed to the road, we escaped all
difficulty in finding our way over the ranges. Fatigued, wet, and
hungry, we required refreshment and rest; so after taking what was
necessary for the inner man, we soon retired for the night, and
slept, as only travellers can sleep, until morning.</p>

<p>Partaking of an early breakfast, we proceeded on our journey
through the district. Four miles from Dapto, not far from Terry's
River, we turned off the road to visit Mr. Evans' farm. Passing
through good enclosures, we saw plenty of fat cattle and milch
cows; and although the buildings were none of the most elegant, yet
the thatching was very neat; in fact, every thing around, though
rough, showed substance and prosperity. The property, we understood
from him, was not his own; and this circumstance was very probably
the reason of the homestead being but that of a rough working
farmer, such as is seen in some parts of the Weald of Sussex, where
they look more to utility than ornament. However he was building a
better residence and premises on his own ground, on the opposite
side of the road, nearer the mountains where the land, he told us,
was of a richer quality still.</p>

<p>In an hour we returned to the road along a different path; and
after fording Terry's River, we ascended a high and steep hill.
Surmounting this, the road leads over a succession of hills, with
here and there some commencement of cultivation. These hills are
covered with the same luxuriant vegetation as that seen on the
eastern flank of Mount Keera; the timber is of the same gigantic
growth; and the ravines and valleys display the same beautiful
flowering shrubs; while the soil is equally good; and wherever
cultivation had begun there were great promises of an abundant
crop. This description of country continues until you enter upon
the low lands again, after twelve miles travelling from Dapto,
where you descend into a valley watered by the Minumurra Creek, on
the banks of which is situated the township of Jamberoo. This
valley is a very pretty spot; and not only does it measure a
considerable breadth of arable land, but the surrounding hills are
covered with a fertile soil, all more or less enclosed and under
cultivation. At the bottom of the valley there is an extensive
swamp, said to contain more than two thousand acres, which in the
dry season is covered with nutritious verdure, attracting the
cattle far and near to it. From the inquiries we made, we do not
hesitate to give an opinion that this marsh could be drained, there
being a fall of some few feet. Once reclaimed, it would be as fine
an agricultural property, for its extent, as any in New South
Wales. We saw that European grasses and clovers thrive very well in
this humid district, and the cattle depasturing on them were in the
finest condition.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the heavy rain which continued to fall, we made
no stay at Jamberoo, but proceeded over the hills to the township
of Kiama, eight miles distant in an easterly direction, on the
sea-coast. These hills have been broken up into farms in every
direction; and the country is cleared of timber to a great extent
showing its undulating character, which has always a pleasing
appearance. When you reach the highest part of them, you command a
view of what appears not unlike a lake at the end of a valley; but
on a nearer approach, you find it to be the little bay of Kiama,
where small coasting-vessels find an anchorage; though it is far
from safe, being open to the north-east. The town of Kiama is on
this bay, eighty-eight miles from Sydney, and very beautifully
situated. It is a rising place, surrounded by land of the finest
quality, to the water's edge; and the scenery of the country behind
strikingly picturesque. And now that there is a small steamboat to
touch at it from Sydney, it may become a place of resort for those
who seek relief from illness, or repose from the toils of business.
The climate is peculiarly mild for a winter residence, if we may
judge from the great height to which the Australian palm-tree
grows; and the ranges towards the west promise shelter from the hot
winds of the Australian summer, from which it is difficult to
escape.</p>

<p>Leaving Kiama, we journeyed onwards due south, intending, if
possible, to reach Coolangatta, the residence of Mr. Berry, distant
sixteen miles, before night. The road was very bad, and cut up by
the heavy rain, which still fell: on your left is the sea, and on
your right the country is hilly. It is pleasing to pass the number
of small farms you see on either side of the road; the possessors
of them appear independent men, made so by being industrious, and
expending their labour upon a fertile soil. Many of them had horses
and cattle, besides their farm-steadings; and those who had been
any length of time on the land possessed all that was useful and
comfortable in conducting the operations of a dairy-farm. About
four miles on the way you come to an extensive flat covered with
the most verdant pasture; formerly it was a swamp, and at times
overflowed with water. No one thought of reclaiming it, until
fortune brought a Mr. Richard Millar there; he saw that something
could be made of it; he drained it; and now it is the richest of
pasture-lands, supporting many cows for his extensive dairy, and
fattening a number of oxen, which he sends to the Sydney market.
The rain still falling heavily, and our destination nearly twelve
miles off, we reached within two miles a part of a road where you
have to travel along the sea-beach, and were told that the tide was
unfavourable for us to proceed; so we made the best of it, and
accepted the invitation of a small farmer to remain for the night
under shelter of his hut. He is a tenant under the landowner, on a
clearing lease; a system that has been acted upon with success by
many landed proprietors in the district of Illawarra. The house was
a poor tenement, but its inmates were rich in kindness; they gave
us what they had with a welcome, and we were thankful. His name is
John Stapleton of Geringong.</p>

<p>In the morning we started for Coolangatta, which is situated on
the Shoalhaven River at the extreme south of the Illawarra country;
the son of our host accompanying us to the Long beach, where a
small river falls into the sea, under some high land. To this
point, some two or three miles, the soil is of the richest
description, the brush-land particularly; and even where it is
heavily timbered, it repays the labour expended on clearing it
better than more open lands with a poorer soil. Crossing the river,
and proceeding along the beach, should the tide be out, you can
gallop on the hard sand for six or seven miles. We were fortunate
in finding it so, otherwise it would have been heavy travelling on
the loose sands, or through the belt of scrub, which here lies
along the coast, about a mile in width. After riding comfortably in
this manner the distance we have mentioned, we turned from the
beach, and entered this belt of land, through which a road has been
cut, and a bridge built over a small creek. Crossing this bridge we
emerged from the dense brushwood, and suddenly came into a
beautiful open country, with Coolangatta Mountain rising to the
height of nine hundred feet before us. This view is exceedingly
picturesque: on your left is the dark belt of wood skirting the
sea; on your right a forest of the finest timber; and before you is
the beautiful conical hill we have named, seen through an open
space of considerable breadth, extending for upwards of a mile to
its base, which slopes down to the mouth of the Shoalhaven River.
On this slope, which faces the south, is the residence of Alexander
Berry, Esq., a member of the legislature. It is a
cottage-residence, having a large verandah in front, with numerous
offices and small dwellings behind; the whole forming a square of
some extent. The proprietor was from home; but we were most
hospitably received by his two brothers and a sister, and every
attention was paid to our comfort.</p>

<p>In the morning, accompanied by Mr. Berry's brothers, we rode
partly, and climbed partly, to the summit of this picturesque
mountain. Coolangatta, or Colingatta&mdash;as it is sometimes
spelt&mdash;rises, as we were informed, nine hundred feet high; and
it appears fully that height, from the circumstance of its base
being at the level of the sea. It is of a conical shape; and to the
very top the soil is of the richest kind, every where covered
thickly with grass. Mr. Berry has cut down the trees on the ridge
which forms the spur sloping towards the house, so that there are
not any trees to obstruct the view as you ascend. After climbing
many parts much too steep to ride, we arrived at the summit, and
were amply repaid for our trouble. The view from this eminence, as
well as of the hill itself, is splendid; you are perched upon the
pinnacle of a mountain, rising in giant-like grandeur from a plain,
supported, as it were, by three spurs, which, from the elevation of
the eye, appear like buttresses; one is towards the house, a second
stretching to the confluence of the Broughton and Shoalhaven
Rivers, and a third towards the country inland; all three being
about equidistant, and giving what we should call a graceful form
to the mountain. On a fine day the view of the surrounding country
is one of the most beautiful we remember to have seen in the
colony. Looking towards the east, you have the coast-line running
north and south, strongly marked by the broad dark belt of wood
which we have mentioned, and dividing the wide expanse of ocean
beyond from the open and cultivated lands lying at your feet, which
surround the residence of the proprietor of the mount. Glancing
your eye along the spur on which the house is built, you see a
green meadow at its foot, on the margin of the Shoalhaven River,
which stream cuts through the belt of scrub into the sea. Beyond
the river appear the waters of Shoalhaven and Crookhaven connected
together by a canal cut by the enterprising proprietor, and forming
an island of the headland between; in this channel there is
sufficient water for a small steamer or coasting-vessel to enter.
This brings your prospect more to the south, where an extensive
lagoon is visible; and, in the far distance, the harbour of Jervis'
Bay. Turning a little towards the interior, between the distant
ranges and the banks of the river, are broad flat lands, which the
application of modern improvements in draining and culture by Mr.
Berry have made a valuable property. To the westward you see the
Broughton River at your feet, winding through a wide plain, showing
here and there evidences of man's industry; and in the mountains
beyond are the famous Shoalhaven gullies, ravines of great depth,
from 500 to 1200 feet, and of tremendous appearance. Lastly,
turning to the north, you have the splendid view, coastways,
terminated by Mount Keera. During our ascent and descent of the
mountain, our enjoyment of the surrounding scenery was considerably
disturbed by the swarms of mosquitoes which tormented us; they say
they favour strangers more with their attentions than the people
living in the country: we can speak of their having punished us on
this occasion.</p>

<p>We returned to breakfast, passing through the cultivated ground
near the house; and we could not but remark the completeness and
extent of this princely property, which may be said to bound the
view within scope of this beautiful peak. Mr. Berry selected this
spot in the early times of the colony, when grants from the crown
could be obtained on easier terms than now. And certainly the
property, not from its extent alone, but from the richness of the
land&mdash;stated to be superior to that of Illawarra&mdash;is
perhaps the most valuable in New South Wales. The improvements
which have been added to it from time to time, and the application
of the best system of culture to the soil, have made these broad
lands what they are&mdash;a princely possession, which we trust the
respected proprietor may long live to enjoy. As we were pressed for
time, we were compelled to deny ourselves the pleasure of remaining
a few days with the agreeable inmates of this delightful residence;
so we lost no time in getting back to Dapto, and from thence to
Wollongong.</p>

<p>This little seaport town is sixty miles from Sydney, containing
between 500 and 600 inhabitants, and upwards of a hundred
well-built houses, several places of worship, and a few good inns.
It is becoming a place of considerable commercial importance in the
colony, from being the principal shipping-port for the produce of
this fertile district, which commands a preference-price for its
butter in the Sydney market. Although little more than an open
roadstead naturally, the bay on which the town is situated has been
rendered safe shelter for vessels, by cutting into the rock on the
south side, and building a substantial stone pier; thereby forming
a harbour and jetty, safe at all times for a steamer to come
alongside. We were informed that this was amongst the last of the
works constructed by the prisoners before the colony ceased to be a
penal settlement; and Illawarra is well pleased at the completion
of the work. An enlargement of the harbour, by the construction of
an outer breakwater, has been spoken of; but the one they have will
do very well for the present.</p>

<p>We cannot say that the immediate neighbourhood of Wollongong
presents any picturesque scenery equal to the other parts of
Illawarra; its characteristic is richness of soil. The well-fed
appearance of the cattle met with in a short ramble round the
neighbourhood, is proof also of the nutritious qualities of the
pasture, to which they have evidently unstinted access. The
well-kept fences in every direction within the environs of the
town, the value set upon the land, and the care bestowed upon its
cultivation and pasture, all evince the prosperity of the settlers.
And we cannot take our leave of this beautiful little district and
its hospitable inhabitants, without noticing a feature in their
manners which no one can fail to observe in riding through it.
There appears to exist amongst them a more kindly, friendly feeling
than you commonly meet with in other parts of the colony; and the
stranger who has travelled far and wide in the land, like
ourselves, is agreeably surprised at the good-humoured "Good day!"
with which he is accosted in his wandering through the fertile,
beautiful, and romantic district of Illawarra.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we embarked on board the <i>William IV</i>
steamboat for Sydney, where we did not arrive, in consequence of
the slowness of the boat, until the following morning, after
encountering a most tempestuous night at sea, mingled with rain and
thunder. Since then another vessel has been put into the trade
possessing greater speed; and the passage to Wollongong is now
accomplished in little more than one-half the time occupied by the
old boat. As we entered Port Jackson heads in the gloom of the
night, with the cliffs occasionally lit up by gleams of lightning,
the scene was indescribably grand. And the lighthouse on the south
head, shedding its revolving light on all around, looked like a
giant watch-tower guarding the entrance to the portals of a mighty
castle. From the tempestuous ocean we were soon safely within the
placid waters of Sydney harbour, where the swell of the Pacific
subsides into the ripple of a lake.</p>

<p>Although we intend in the present chapter to do but little more
than allude to the northern counties and districts of New South
Wales, yet, on some future occasion, if the reception of these
pages by the public be favourable, we may be encouraged to enter
into details relative to those extensive regions. Their topography
and statistics are so little known to the British public, that many
of our readers will be surprised when we state that they cover an
area of <i>inhabited</i> country equal in extent to the Province of
Victoria, which, as we have before remarked, is about one-fifth
larger than the kingdom of England; that these districts possess
rivers and harbours second to none in the south for beauty and
utility; that for richness of land and excellence of climate, they
possess all that is requisite for the use and comfort of man; that
great part of those delightful regions are open downs, containing
millions of acres of land covered with the most luxuriant natural
pasturage, at an elevation of fifteen hundred feet above the level
of the sea, which renders the climate comparatively cool in these
low latitudes; that these lands are occupied by a high-minded and
superior class of settlers, possessing hundreds of thousands, nay
millions of sheep, cattle, and horses; that this high table-land is
a considerable distance back from the ocean, with an intervening
tract of country of vast extent, possessing navigable rivers where
steamboats and coasting-vessels find profitable traffic, and a busy
population for the last twenty years and more have not only been
cultivating the fertile soil on their banks, but even building
ships of considerable tonnage, out of the native timber, to
transport the produce; and from these facts will have some idea of
the extent and importance of this part of the territory of New
South Wales, and may well wonder at the advancement of
civilisation, and development of the resources of this section of
Eastern Australia, hitherto so little known in England.</p>

<p>Besides having been eye-witnesses of all that we have described
in the preceding chapters, our joint experiences and travels extend
over the greater portion of the territory just alluded to; and one
of the authors of this book has explored the intertropical regions
at the northern boundary of the colony, in the capacity of a
naturalist; from whence he has enriched the museums of the United
Kingdom with new and interesting contributions from the animal and
vegetable productions peculiar to that locality. In this field
alone there is abundant materials to fill an ordinary volume; but
we refrain from entering into details, until we have more scope for
our pen; and for the present venture only upon a few cursory
remarks respecting the most important of these districts, without
which our sketch of the colony would be incomplete.</p>

<p>The districts comprised within the system of waters forming the
Hunter River are better fitted for agriculture than pasture; hence
they are more densely populated than the squatting districts
farther north; and it will be seen on the map that they are
comprised within five of the original nineteen counties of New
South Wales, viz. Northumberland, Durham, Hunter, Philip, and
Brisbane. The Hunter River, which enters the sea about eighty miles
to the northward of Port Jackson, has a course of about two hundred
miles from its source in the Liverpool range of mountains, running
in a southerly and easterly direction; but it is not navigable from
its entrance at Fort Hunter further than the town of Morpeth, some
thirty-five miles distant by water. Powerful sea-going steamers ply
between Sydney and this town daily; from which circumstance it is
becoming a very important place. This river has many tributary
streams, two of which are of considerable magnitude; the first you
come to is about twenty miles from the harbour of Newcastle at Port
Hunter, and is called the Williams River: the second is fifteen
miles higher up, called the Paterson River; and these two streams
are navigable for a greater distance than the principal stream or
main river. There are many flourishing towns, villages, and farms,
with gentlemen's residences on its banks, and on those of the
streams that fall into it.</p>

<p>There appear to be three marked divisions in the capabilities
and climate of this extensive section of the colony, viz. the
pasture-lands on the Upper Hunter and its feeders; the agricultural
lands on the Lower Hunter and its tributaries, the Williams and
Paterson Rivers; and the barren lands near the coast, with their
valuable coal-mines. Those three divisions are commonly understood
by the colonists, although they do not appear traced out on any
official map; and they are said to be more or less exposed to the
visitation of droughts, the coast being freer from them than the
mountain section, where they are, again, less injurious than in the
middle portion. Notwithstanding the abundance of fertile land on
this noble river, the farmer is at all times unsafe with his crops,
from the occurrence of these dreadful visitations, which are very
uncertain. The effects of these droughts may be seen even upon the
native trees, which in many places are completely destroyed,
although growing upon the alluvial soil near the river. We,
however, travelled through this country during the best season and
in a most favourable year, when the land was clothed with verdure
and the crops flourishing; and unless we had been assured from
unquestionable evidence, we could not have believed that so lovely
a country ever suffered from the want of rain; such, however, is
the case; and the traveller less fortunate than ourselves may visit
the Hunter River district and find it a blighted region. In
speaking thus plainly of this part of the colony, we are bound to
state what it would be a suppression of the truth to withhold. New
South Wales, however, can well afford to have the whole truth told;
and still the balance will be found greatly to preponderate in her
favour. To our apprehension she has more formidable difficulties to
contend with in the question of the future supply of labour, and in
the management of the plethora of riches with which she seems
likely to be oppressed, interfering, as we fear they will do, with
the former industrious pursuits of the people.</p>

<p>The principal towns in this district are Newcastle, Maitland,
and Morpeth. The first is a seaport town situated at the mouth of
the river, about eighty miles from Sydney, and affords safe
anchorage for vessels of large burden. It has little to recommend
it as a place of residence, being built upon sandhills between the
river and the sea-beach, without a tree or patch of natural verdure
to relieve the glare of the drift-sand. It contains nearly three
hundred houses, with about fifteen hundred inhabitants. It is a
place which, under ordinary circumstances, should progress rapidly
in commercial importance, from being the outport of the produce
from this extensive district, which includes the only workable
coal-mines of any extent in the colony. From this latter
circumstance, its name was changed from King's-town to Newcastle,
after the famous capital of the land of coal and grindstones. There
were several large vessels at anchor in the harbour when we visited
it; among them one of nine hundred tons, which could not approach
the wharf; but when this is finished, with other projected works,
the facilities for shipping will be much improved. The Australian
Agricultural Company possess the coal-mines nearest to the town;
which are so advantageously situated for shipping purposes, that
the coasting-vessels lie under a shute within a hundred yards of
the pit's mouth, from whence the coals are discharged into them
without any extra labour in loading. In fact, the seam of coal is
now being worked under the bed of the river, and the town itself is
built above it; the edge of the seam cropping out on the coast;
where the student of geology may find some interesting fossils
amongst the shale which separates it from the sandstone.</p>

<p>Until within the last few years these coal-mines were worked
under a monopoly granted to the Australian Agricultural Company by
the government; but this has been successfully upset by some
spirited landholders on the Hunter River, who possess coal on their
properties, and who now work them in fair competition with the
company; and we may safely say, that under the increased demand for
coal, not only for steam purposes and home consumption in the
colony, but the high price it brings in New Zealand and California,
there is every likelihood of these mines realising fortunes for
their proprietors equal to the possessors of the more glittering
diggings. Among the private collieries now at work we may mention
those on the Burrwood estate, three miles from Newcastle, stated to
be more inexhaustible and of better quality than the company's
mines. We visited them, and were most obligingly shown over the
works by an intelligent Scotch miner named James Birrell. The road
to them from the town, for the first half of the way, is the common
road, and then a tramway for the remaining half. The workings
commence at the foot of a hill, where we entered a tunnel cut
through solid coal, about five feet and a half high, and double
that width, with an equal depth of workable coal above, passing
through the hill, and opening out into a small valley. From this
main tunnel there are two branch tunnels half its width running
into the hill, each of two hundred yards in length, the working
"bands" being of the same dimensions, with a stratum of fire-clay
eighteen inches thick. It is proposed to run these branch tunnels
right through, to the cliffs on the coast, many hundred yards
distant, where the coal-seams are seen. When an act of council is
obtained to extend the tramroad to the wharf, it will enhance the
value of these mines considerably, as the coal may then be sent to
the shipping direct from the seam.</p>

<p>Where so much coal abounds, the intelligent reader will conclude
that there is no part of Australia better situated for the
establishment of manufactories requiring that indispensable
material to conduct their operations than Newcastle and its
neighbourhood. Already there are large smelting works erected,
which we visited when in full work, and were very much gratified to
see the mode in which they smelted copper ores from Adelaide, and
saw the fine quality of metal extracted from the famous Burra Burra
mine ores. Besides this manufactory we visited a pottery, but the
proprietor and his men had gone to the gold-fields; and crossing
the river to the township of Stockton, opposite Newcastle, we
visited a large and complete tweed-cloth factory belonging to two
enterprising colonists, Messrs. Fisher and Donaldson. In fact, had
the labour of the country not been disturbed by the discovery of
the gold-fields, there was a growing desire amongst the capitalists
of the colony to concentrate their means in establishing factories
of the kind we have mentioned on the banks of this river. And we
are not talking wide of the mark when we say, that with the return
of that labour few investments will pay better than those of the
manufacturer of the raw materials produced in the colony.</p>

<p>There is such a field in the resources already developed in
Australia for the enterprising manufacturers of this country, that
we cannot but advert to it more fully; in which they may not only
realise a handsome remuneration for their skill and experience, but
with the necessary means and appliances of capital and labour, are
certain of amassing fortunes in a short time. As we have already
mentioned, there is even at the present early stage of colonial
progress, a visible step in this direction. Such articles as
leather, soap, tweed-cloths, &amp;c. are rapidly disappearing from
the import-list of the colony; and the numerous extensive
manufactories of these articles of general consumption have amply
rewarded their enterprising projectors. The transparent fact that
the tweed-cloth manufacturers save the freight of the raw material
to England, and that of the manufactured article back to the seat
of its production, is enough, we should say, to encourage the most
cautious man in Yorkshire to establish broad-cloth looms in
Australia, seeing that the coat worn of this fabric by the
colonists has circumnavigated the globe between the sheep's back
and his own. Surely there is some good profit to be made,
notwithstanding the higher price of labour in the colony, by saving
the intermediate expense of transit, where the wool travels 16,000
miles in its raw state to be manufactured. Those interested will
find that this is only one of the many products in Australia which
could be turned to equally profitable account by the enterprising
manufacturer. It seems surprising, even as it is, that writing and
printing papers should be imported, when such abundant materials
for their manufacture have been running to waste, among the
calico-clothed population of these colonies; or that a wine-glass
or tumbler should be imported, when such a pure element for the
composition of crystal is to be found in the snow-white sands of
Sydney and Newcastle. Although much has been done, considering the
age of these colonies, there is ample scope for British capital and
labour in this important field.</p>

<p>Besides the profits accruing from the establishment of such
factories, the projectors would be serving a higher purpose in the
general progress of the colony than merely developing its material
resources, for their establishments would become industrial schools
for developing those inventive and constructive talents of the
Australian youth, which the rude operations of producing the raw
material do not bring into play. We hope in time to see the
industrious and steady class of artisans augmented in those
colonies; a class of men whose influence would tend to raise the
population to that standard of intelligence to which their
fellow-subjects in the towns of the mother country have attained.
There is no doubt that the rising generation of this new world,
like their cousins on the other side of the Atlantic, inherit the
mechanical genius of their forefathers; a genius which has raised
the Anglo-Saxon race far above all others in the field of labour,
where strength, utility, and invention have been the
<i>desiderata</i>. The "currency-lads," we trust, are not all
destined to be shepherds and gold-diggers, any more than that this
embryo nation is to remain always dependent upon Great Britain for
her supplies of merchandise. There are greater ends recorded, we
nope, in the book of Time for it and them. We expect to see one of
the corner-stones of Australia's future national superstructure
raised by their industrious and inventive energies; for, however
beneficial the present large amount of manufactures consumed by the
extravagant colonists may prove to the British manufacturer and
merchant, the loss is great to the colony, seeing that the money
expended for labour upon these manufactures is spent <i>out</i> of
the country, while much of the material of which they are made
exists around them.</p>

<p>About thirty-eight miles from Newcastle, by water, Wallis Creek
joins the Hunter River from the south; on each side of this creek
is the double township of Maitland, named East and West Maitland
accordingly. The former is about twenty miles from
Newcastle&mdash;though by water it is nearly double that
distance&mdash;one hundred and twenty miles from Sydney, and three
miles from Morpeth, which we have stated to be the head of
navigation on the Hunter River. There is said to be a deficiency of
good drinkable water at this town, which is certainly a great
drawback, for it is most pleasantly situated. There are two very
good churches in it, one Episcopalian, the other Roman Catholic;
about two hundred and fifty houses, one half built of stone and
brick. A branch of the Bank of Australasia conducts its business
here in an exceedingly good building. Before the gold-discovery it
contained about one thousand inhabitants. West Maitland, on the
opposite side of the creek, is more than double the size of East
Maitland, and contains a population nothing short of two thousand
five hundred, though not the original township. While East Maitland
is built upon a site laid out by government, this town has risen on
the lands of private individuals; and it has not only taken the
lead in every respect of its eastern sister, but it is likely to
keep it. There are several well-built places of worship here, and
it is full of very excellent private houses, shops, inns,
flour-mills, &amp;c. &amp;c.; in short, it is the chief town of the
Hunter River district, and is the centre of an extensive
agricultural country. These advantages, combined with the traffic
passing through it from the districts of New England and Liverpool
plains, have made it what it is. It also possesses one of the best
provincial newspapers in the colony; and the manner in which this
paper, the <i>Maitland Mercury</i>, is conducted is highly
creditable to the editor, and calculated to do much good to the
community.</p>

<p>Near both East and West Maitland coal-mines are worked of very
superior quality, and abundant in quantity. Tobacco also is being
manufactured here after the American manner; and as the same skill
is applied by Messrs. Walthall and Clarke, two American gentlemen,
who were formerly engaged in the manufacture of it in their own
country, we cannot see any reason why Australian tobacco should not
equal in quality that of American. The Hunter and its tributaries
have also their vineyards; and the wines made from the grapes
promise to have a reputation beyond the shores of Australia. Among
the most successful growers we may mention Mr. King of Irrawang;
and the champagne of Mr. Burnett will be pronounced to be very fine
by those who know what champagne really is.</p>

<p>About twenty miles north of Port Hunter is the entrance to Port
Stephens, a snug harbour; which often proves a welcome haven to
coasting-vessels when the north-east gales catch them off
Sugar-loaf Point. The principal stream which flows into this
estuary is the Karuah River, navigable as far as Booral,
twenty-seven miles from the entrance of the harbour. Here is
situated a tract of land belonging to the Australian Agricultural
Company, consisting of 487,102 acres. The township of Stroud, which
the company have built on this property, we have no hesitation in
saying is one of the neatest and most compact villages in the
colony. It is situated on the east bank of the Karuah River, and is
altogether one of the prettiest places we have seen in these
northern counties. Opposite each house there is a small
garden-plot, and behind some are larger gardens, filled with all
kinds of flowers and fruit trees, amongst which the orange-tree
grows conspicuously. The houses are mostly built in the cottage
style, for the labouring people employed on the property; the
residences of the officers of the company are very good and
comfortable, and that of the governor is a mansion. There is a
small church likewise, capable of holding about two hundred people;
and as we happened to be there on a Sunday, we have seldom seen a
more attentive and decent congregation than were on that day
assembled within its walls. The surrounding country abounds in
equally picturesque spots to the one selected; and some one
remarked that other sites might have been fixed upon for the
township with more propriety than the present one: perhaps this
might have been done, taking all things into consideration; but it
is difficult at first to fix upon the best locality, where all are
so beautiful. Much has been said about the local management of the
Australian Agricultural Company. Without entering into that
question, we must say that we were exceedingly gratified with the
aspect of affairs at this truly English village; not only at seeing
the general appearance of comfort and cleanliness in the dwellings,
and on the persons of all the labourers in their employment, but
also at hearing the cottagers express their gratitude and
contentment at the treatment they received from the company's
superintendents. And we were very favourably impressed with the
good feeling and judicious management of those intrusted with such
important duties.</p>

<p>The distance from Stroud to the Manning River, which is the
northern boundary of the company's land, is about forty-five miles.
We rode over greater part of this country, and considered it very
good pasture-land; some of it particularly so, apparently well
suited for farms. The line of road which passes through it from
north to south is tolerably good as far as Gloucester, and a little
way beyond it. This is one of the company's stations, of which
there are several on the road. We were much pleased with the
country about it, which consists of broad meadows, surrounded by
rugged and picturesque mountains, not too near. On the higher lands
we noticed what are considered indications of the presence of gold,
particularly the abundance of quartz, which forms the character of
the rocks. But gold has not always been found where this mineral
occurs; and if we are not in error, we think that it is only in
what geologists call quartz-veins that it occurs, the amorphous
masses of quartz-rock being non-auriferous: its presence, however,
encourages the people to search for the precious metal. But this
part of the territory has a value independently of these
indications, from its great capabilities in an agricultural point
of view, and for the rearing of stock. At Gloucester there is a
small inn, kept by a man of the name of Bradley, and no doubt in
time it will become a village; at present, however, it is only a
station, where an overseer resides, having a great many other
stations under his charge, far and near to it. We were informed
that the company possess here a thousand horses, three thousand
head of cattle, and as many as twenty thousand sheep. The herds and
flocks we passed during our journey appeared to be in excellent
condition; which is not only a certain indication of good
pasture-land, but also of good management. The gold-fever had
extended to this establishment; and no doubt much trouble will be
experienced in consequence, from the difficulty of retaining
shepherds and stockmen sufficient to conduct the operations of the
surrounding stations.</p>

<p>About one hundred and seventy-eight miles to the northward of
Port Stephens, by the coast, is the town and harbour of Port
Macquarie, one of the beautiful marine retreats of New South Wales.
During our short stay at this pleasant spot we met many very
agreeable people residing in its neighbourhood; and we regret that
circumstances over which the inhabitants had no control have made
this pretty place a deserted village. This is one of the old penal
settlements on the coast, and in those days it was described to us
as a stirring place, deriving its prosperity from a large
government expenditure, which had stopped entirely on the cessation
of transportation; the consequences of which were, that many highly
respectable men were ruined. At present, it mainly depends upon its
progress, or rather recovering its former prosperity, from the
large population springing up in the New England district, of which
there is a likelihood of its becoming the outlet for their produce.
We are afraid, however, that the inhabitants speculate too much
upon these future prospects; for they cannot shut their eyes to the
fact that Port Macquarie is only a bad harbour for very small
coasting vessels, and not always safely to be entered even by them;
and we think it very questionable whether the locality has
capabilities of being made better. Still, in the town and its
suburbs, there is much that is promising; you see many exceedingly
good houses, churches, and schools; and as a place of residence for
persons from the interior, or for invalids, we can quite
understand, with its beautiful rides in the neighbourhood, why its
sanguine occupants look forward to its becoming a place of resort
for their wealthy fellow-colonists in the south. The people of New
South Wales possess the same tastes for marine residences and
watering-places as their forefathers in England, or their cousins
in America. The latter have their Saratogas and their Newports; so
the Anglo-Australians among their many places of resort for health
and amusement may number Port Macquarie.</p>

<p>Thus far we have glanced at the northern counties of New South
Wales, coming within the limits of what is called the old settled
boundary of the colony. We now come to notice more particularly
those northern districts which are distinguished from the south by
their marked character in climate and vegetation, such as the
Clarence River, Darling Downs, Moreton Bay, and Wide Bay districts.
Unlike the country to the south and west of the Hunter River, this
northern section of the colony is not subject to those calamitous
droughts, from which the settlers in the older parts of the country
have suffered in some years so fearfully. In these intertropical
regions there are regular wet and dry seasons, which occur
periodically upon the setting-in of the north-east trade winds,
frequently reaching as high as 28° south latitude; whereas in the
southern section of the colony the weather is variable, and
showery, more or less, throughout the year. And we would here
remark, that when we have spoken in the foregoing pages of wet and
dry seasons, we merely allude to the summer and winter months, the
former being less rainy than the latter, excepting when a drought
occurs, which has no regard to seasons. North of the latitude also
above mentioned, although the weather is considerably warmer during
the year, the thermometer averaging ten degrees higher, still the
country is not subject to those blighting hot winds which occur
annually in the south, and which are most severely felt in
Victoria. At the same time we must confess, that it is not such a
healthy climate to reside in as the less humid regions of the
south; it does not possess, generally, that pure and dry atmosphere
which distinguishes the climate of Australia from all others we
have experienced; and the humidity which prevails during the
hottest months in the year enervates the European constitution.</p>

<p>This marked difference in the climate of the two sections of the
colony, which we have thus rather arbitrarily laid down, produces
many new features in the character of the vegetation; and we may
safely assert, that while the north possesses all the shrubs and
trees which adorn the south, she has thousands of distinct species
possessing tropical luxuriance, added to her wondrous groves and
forests. We should not say that timber was of good quality,
generally speaking, in New South Wales; but in the regions of the
north the timber is not only of a much finer growth than in the
south, but it has the appearance of being sounder in quality. The
cedar from the Clarence River is highly valued in the London
market, and some of the logs imported here have been considered
equal in beauty of grain to the finest mahogany. The Moreton Bay
chestnut also is a handsome tree, and excellent timber; and the
Moreton Bay pine is as useful for building materials in that part
of the colony as the Baltic pine is in England; while, to our
taste, it surpasses in elegance of form the Norfolk Island pine, of
which so much has been said.</p>

<p>Among this beautiful genus of pines, known to botanists as the
genus <i>Auracaria</i>, is one species worthy of being separately
mentioned, viz. the "Bunya Bunya" of the aborigines, or
<i>Auracaria bidwellii</i>, named after Mr. Bidwell, an
accomplished botanist, and commissioner of crown lands for the Wide
Bay district. This magnificent pine has been only found within a
small tract of country, situated between Wide Bay and Moreton Bay,
at the northern boundary of the colony, in latitude 26° S.; and is
generally associated with the Moreton Bay pine (<i>A.
Cuninghamii</i>) in the dense pine-scrubs which intersect that
country. It grows but sparingly compared to the latter tree, and
may be easily distinguished from it by the large and umbrageous
foliage it displays on its branches, which only grow from the top
of the tree, leaving the trunk naked for two-thirds of its length
from the butt. The most remarkable part, however, of this tree, is
the cone which it bears. This large cluster of seed-vessels, when
full grown, commonly measures 30 inches in circumference and 12
inches in height; and numbers about 150 conical-shaped
seed-vessels, as hard as a nut, each containing an edible kernel
larger than that of a walnut.</p>

<p>The aborigines roast these seeds, crack the husk between two
stones, and eat them while they are hot. They taste something like
a yam, or hard dry potato, and we have relished them exceedingly
with a little salt. Though these cones may be found occasionally
growing on a solitary tree, yet there is a periodical season in
which they bear abundantly, and that occurs only once every four
years, when the fruit is gathered ripe for six or eight months.
This season is held as a great festival amongst the aborigines of
the surrounding country, when they congregate at this particular
locality in greater numbers than they are known to do in any other
part of Australia, many of them coming from a distance of 200 miles
to participate in the "Bunya Bunya" feast. We visited the spot
during this quartennial season, and witnessed some of the most
interesting traits in the character of these sable children of the
forest, which we hope to lay before the reader in another volume;
suffice it to say, for the present, that they all get sleek and fat
upon this food, especially the children. The local government have
passed an act prohibiting the demolition of those trees by the
settlers, under heavy penalties.</p>

<p>The forests and dense scrubs which abound in the northern
districts are more umbrageous than in the south. The picturesque
apple-tree and broad-leaved fig-trees grow more plentifully
throughout them, contrasting favourably with the thin-leaved
gum-trees and pines. The latter genus of trees (<i>Ficus</i>) are
very singular in their growth. On the banks of the Macleay
River&mdash;a stream to the northward of Port Macquarie&mdash;we
saw some plants in all their stages of development. From these
specimens it would appear as if the seed was first conveyed by
birds or other animals to the decayed part of the trunk, a hole in
the branches, or a crevice in the bark of an ordinary gum-tree,
from whence a creeper is produced, with its roots growing
downwards, sometimes clasping the trunk of the tree, and sometimes
dropping perpendicularly from the branches, until they finally
enter the ground; while the stem of the plant climbs upwards,
throwing out branches, which entwine themselves round those of the
doomed tree, until they ultimately envelope it in their snake-like
folds, crushing its aged trunk, and preventing the circulation of
its sap, which soon destroys it; the creeper becoming a tree
itself, while the old tree rots away. From its numerous descending
roots cementing or growing together, the trunk of the fig-tree has
the appearance of buttresses and columns; and as they are all
surface-roots, they spread out from the butt of the tree, upraised
many feet from the ground, like walls; spreading in their
ramifications as far from the trunk as the branches rear themselves
aloft, which we have seen to the height of 200 feet. It has a
thick, smooth leaf, like the India-rubber tree; its fruit is like
the Turkey fig, only much smaller, and when ripe is sweet and
palatable; the birds are fond of it, especially pigeons, which
afford excellent shooting for the sportsman in Australia.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Oakes, of the Macleay, at whose place we saw the
fig-trees just described, possesses two enormous trees of this
kind, one of them measuring 48 feet in circumference in the trunk,
not including its singularly upraised roots. These trees he
purposes to spare from the woodman's axe; and it is our impression
that those who may visit that, or any other locality where they
grow luxuriantly, will say that they are among the most remarkable
vegetable productions of this interesting land; and as they exude a
white glutinous milk when probed with a knife, which the aborigines
use to fix feathers in their hair, it is probable that they may be
turned to some useful account, and this milky sap prove to be one
of the juices from which gutta-percha or India-rubber is made.</p>

<p>The aborigines of the northern districts are also a more robust
people than those inhabiting the south; most probably from the
country yielding them a greater abundance of natural food, and the
temperature of the climate being more congenial to their attenuated
bodies. Moreton Bay, in these respects, is essentially the paradise
of the Australian aboriginal inhabitants; there they may revel in
the freedom and nakedness of mother nature throughout all seasons,
without the encumbrance of opossum-skin rugs and blankets, which
are necessary to protect them from the cold south winds in the
higher latitudes; and the waters of the bay furnish them with an
abundance of nourishing animal food, which the bays on the southern
coast do not possess. What will our aldermanic readers think of the
condition of these poor (?) natives, when we state the fact, that
they dine frequently off roasted turtles? In our sojournings
amongst the many interesting localities of this extensive bay, we
have often partaken of a choice cutlet of turtle with our sable
brethren, from a five-hundred-weight animal, cooked in its own
shell; and we can aver that it was far more savoury than the spiced
dishes John Bull has served up from <i>calipash</i> and
<i>calipee</i>, in the shape of turtle-steaks and turtle-soup. The
fact is, the <i>chef de cuisine</i> at the Mansion House might add
a recipe or two worth knowing to his cookery-book from these
natural gourmands. We confess ourselves a little bit of an epicure
in the mode of cooking fish; and their simple method seems to us
the best we have ever seen for preserving the natural juices of a
delicate fish. They first collect the hot ashes from a large fire
made of the mangrove-tree, which are white and free from burning
embers; then the fish is taken "all alive," without being gutted or
scaled, and buried in these hot ashes for a quarter of an hour or
twenty minutes. When it is sufficiently baked the gut comes out in
one mass, and the skin peals off whole, leaving the flakes of meat
firm, white, and savoury, with the natural fat and gravy of the
fish, which in civilised cookery are lost; the former being thrown
away with the gut, and the latter escaping through the scraped
skin.</p>

<p>As the necessities of the settlers in the northern districts
increase, and force them to seek for labour at all hazards, even to
a desire for the renewal of transportation to their shores, they
may make an attempt to employ the natives at equitable
wages&mdash;a system which has not been adhered to in their
dealings with them hitherto&mdash;and thereby save some remnant of
these interesting people; while the world would learn that the
character of our countrymen for humanity is not dormant at the
antipodes. Already the experiment has been successfully tried in
Victoria, since the absorption of white labour by the
gold-diggings; and they have proved themselves <i>useful
labourers</i> at <i>remunerative wages</i>. So generally have they
been employed by the settlers in that province, that the Aboriginal
Protectorate Establishment, instituted there by the Government
from, the foundation of the colony, has been broken up, as no
longer necessary. This is just as it should be, where the children
of the soil are benefited by the riches of their mother earth.
Heretofore the poor black fellow has been refused the due reward
for his work by the colonist; and people have been surprised at
their extreme idleness, in the midst of a great demand for labour.
If they would only reflect on the condition of the Irishman, who
becomes reckless of himself, and is the slave of idleness, in his
native land, where his best energies only earn a miserable pittance
for his subsistence; but when removed to a country like Australia
or America, where he is amply remunerated for his toil, he turns
out an industrious member of society, they would not despair of
making the black fellow a useful man by liberal treatment, and
paying him fair wages for a fair day's work.</p>

<p>Acting upon this principle during our wanderings through the
Australian wilderness, even beyond the confines of civilisation,
where the untutored savage has for the first time beheld a white
man in our person, and during periods of six and eight months at a
time, when we have lived alone attended by two or three of those
wild retainers, we have always found them willing to perform any
office within reach of their capacity, if reasonably rewarded for
their labour, and that reward faithfully discharged according to
the promise made them beforehand. While we have known that the
causes of several murders and robberies committed by them upon the
settlers have been from ill-requited services and the promptings of
revenge, where the white man has unjustly obtained their labour,
under promises of reward which he did not fulfil. In making these
remarks, we do not wish to prejudice the reader against the
settlers for their treatment of the natives generally; for they
have had much to contend with in clearing the way for civilisation;
neither do we agree with the maudlin sentimentalism put forth by
well-meaning but inexperienced enthusiasts, regarding them in this
country; but simply to record the fact, from our own conviction,
and long experience amongst them, that these children of nature,
admitted to be among the lowest beings in the social scale of the
human family, have a clear perception of justice, not only between
man and man in their dealings, but in resisting oppression, where
the strong and powerful white man has endeavoured to take advantage
of their weakness.</p>

<p>Moreton Bay, the Port Philip of the northern districts, at its
navigable entrance is not far short of five hundred miles by sea
from Sydney. Next to that noble sheet of water, it is the largest
harbour in all Australia, and extends from north to south the
entire space between the parallels of 27° and 28° of latitude, and
varying from east to west between three miles and twenty miles
across, giving an approximate average width of twelve miles, by
sixty miles in length. This long and narrow bay is formed by
Moreton Island and Stradbroke Island, two islands equally long and
narrow, covered with drift sand, which trend due north and south,
while the coast on the mainland diverges to the north-west, the bay
lying between; consequently there are three entrances to it from
the Pacific Ocean. From the south it is only a small-boat passage;
and the entrance between the two islands has been abandoned on
account of a dangerous bar which crosses it; but the northern
entrance is a safe, wide, and deep channel for vessels of the
largest burden.</p>

<p>This spacious estuary has numerous rivers flowing into it, four
of them being navigable streams for twenty and fifty miles, viz.
the Brisbane, Logan, Tweed, and Scott. The former, which is of the
greatest magnitude, disembogues itself into the bay on the western
shore, opposite the middle entrance; and on its banks, about
sixteen miles from its mouth, are situated the townships of North
and South Brisbane. The site upon which North Brisbane stands is an
elevated tongue of land, around which the river takes a
considerable bend, and commands a picturesque view of the
surrounding country. This town was laid out and built nearly twenty
years ago, when Moreton Bay was a penal settlement. History blushes
to record the doings of the governors and the governed in those
days. The present dilapidated condition of the prisoners' barracks,
gaol, and government cottages, with an old wind-mill, give the
place a dismal and deserted air, especially when the visitor
associates them with the records of the past. South Brisbane, on
the opposite bank of the river, as been built since the district
was opened up to free settlers in 1841; it is a thriving village,
but unfortunately it stands upon low ground, which is partly
inundated by the river when it overflows its banks during the rainy
season. Here the Australian Steam Navigation Company have erected
large warehouses, and constructed a good wharf for the
accommodation of their steamboats, which carry the great bulk of
the produce and passengers from the district to Sydney. The river
at this spot is a noble deep-flowing fresh-water stream, nearly a
thousand feet in width, and deep enough to float a man-of-war. It
is navigable for forty miles higher up, where it receives the
waters of the Bremer River, a considerable tributary coming from
the south, where the tide flows five miles above the junction. At
this spot, where navigation ceases, is situated the rapidly
increasing town of Ipswich; from whence the squatters on the
extensive district of Darling Downs receive their supplies, and
send their produce for shipment. A small steamboat plies between
this township and South Brisbane daily.</p>

<p>We know of no river in all the Australian colonies which
presents more of those advantageous features which a navigable
stream should possess for opening up the resources of the country
through which it flows, than the Brisbane River. The richest
alluvial soil covers its banks, and the climate is peculiarly
qualified for producing all the vegetable productions common to
tropical countries. Here the traveller from India will be gratified
to see the banana, the mango, the guava, and pine-apple, growing in
the open air. The latter fruit we have seen in a kitchen-garden
plot at a friend's station, planted like rows of cabbages, and as
commonly eaten. At the same time the orange-tree and the vine do
not produce such good fruit as in the south: however, we doubt not
that if the settlers on the higher lands in the interior were to
plant the vine, it would produce a grape capable of furnishing a
good wine. The same disadvantage applies to the production of
wheat, which rots before it comes into ear on the moist lands
around the bay but has been satisfactorily grown on the elevated
downs and table-land in the interior.</p>

<p>These northern districts also possess, or rather, as time rolls
on and the colony continues prosperous, will possess, advantages
over the south in being adapted for the cultivation of cotton,
coffee, sugar, rice, tobacco, and all other valuable articles of
general consumption, the produce of a warm climate and rich soil.
Already experimental plantations of these commodities have been
successfully cultivated at Eagle Farm on the Brisbane River, as far
back as 1840, by Dr. Simpson, the commissioner of crown lands for
the Moreton Bay district; and the first of them, of which so much
has been said, was seen growing by one of the authors of this book
in a settler's garden on the same river seven years ago, which
produced a good sample of cotton. Indeed it is far from being a new
discovery that these northern districts are adapted for the growth
of cotton; for, if we are not mistaken, the cotton-plant was
cultivated successfully in the government garden at North Brisbane
in the early days of the settlement, eighteen years ago. The great
drawback to the further development of these resources has been,
and still is, the want of labour; and we are of opinion that to
produce such articles as cotton, coffee, sugar, and rice
profitably, you must have not only a cheap and abundant supply of
labour, but it must be of that description where the labourers have
been accustomed to carry on field operations under a tropical
sun.</p>

<p>The present dearth of ordinary labour throughout these colonies
is more severely felt in the northern than in the southern and
western districts; for the gold-discoveries in the latter have
drained away the labouring class of people from the former to such
an extent that a portion of the colonists are petitioning for
convict labour. There is every likelihood, however, of a reaction
in favour of the northern districts, should the late discoveries of
gold at Bingara, and the Agricultural Company's land on the Peel
River, be followed up by successful "prospecting" parties further
north. And it is reasonable to suppose that the main range at
Moreton Bay possesses its share of the gold-deposits, as well as
the southern portion of the cordillera. If quartz indicates the
existence of gold in its vicinity, there is abundance of it in the
northern districts; and we should not be surprised to hear soon
that rich veins had been found at North Brisbane, for the town is
built upon quartz-rock and mineral quartz-veins. Altogether the
northern districts of New South Wales have nothing to fear on a
comparison with the southern districts; both have resources which
may be worked to their mutual advantage. And as the colonists and
the government manage this new source of wealth, so will their
adopted country, and the most promising colonial possessions of the
crown, be benefited or injured. Having on several occasions
throughout the foregoing chapters submitted our humble opinions to
the reader on this all-important subject, we will not say more than
repeat, that it is our hope, that these successful colonists, in
their love for gold, will not be induced entirely to neglect the
advancement of agricultural operations and mechanical pursuits,
without which no community can reach that noble position of
self-dependence which is necessary for the maintenance of a free
and industrious people.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI. FUTURE PROSPECTS OP
AUSTRALIA.</h2>

Dependencies"&mdash;The British Parliament and Ministry should take
warning by the past&mdash;A great future in store for Australia and
the Australians.</p>

<p>In order to complete our account of these colonies and the
resources of the territory through which our descriptive narration
purports to conduct the reader, let us consider the present
commercial prosperity of the colonists, and take a retrospective
view of the progress they have made during the past twenty years;
and from such data speculate upon the future prospects of
Australia.</p>

<p>At that period the inhabited portion of the colony of New South
Wales was limited to the nineteen counties which the reader will
find distinguished on the annexed map by a red tint. The total
population in the year 1830, as near as can be ascertained, was
about 55,000. The value of the imports into the colony during that
year was 420,480<i>l</i>.; and the exports, consisting almost
entirely of wool, was 141,461<i>l</i>.; showing, in round numbers,
a consumption of foreign commodities at the rate of 7<i>l</i>.
12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per head of population; while they produced
for exportation not more than 2<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per
head; a balance of trade against the colony equal to 200 per
cent,&mdash;this large deficit being met by the government
expenditure.</p>

<p>In the interval between that date and the close of the year
1851, up to the period of our revisiting Australia, the colony of
New South Wales has become inhabited to the full extent of its
original boundaries, four times the area of the nineteen counties;
and the southern section, formerly known as the district of Port
Philip, has been erected into a separate province under the
well-known title of Victoria, which we have defined on the annexed
map by a blue line. By natural increase and free immigration, the
population of this territory at that date was, in New South Wales
proper 197,168 persons, and in Victoria about 82,000; showing a
total of 279,168 in 1851 against 55,000 in 1830, having increased
fivefold during the space of 21 years. In 1851 the value of the
imports into New South Wales was 1,563,931<i>l</i>., and into the
new colony of Victoria 1,056,000<i>l</i>., giving a total amount of
imports within the original boundaries of the old colony of
2,619,931<i>1</i>.; while the exports in the same year were
respectively 1,796,952<i>l</i>. and 1,423,000<i>l</i>.; a total of
3,219,952<i>l</i>. So that the amount of imports for the old
settlement in 1851, for every man, woman, and child, would be at
the rate of about 8<i>l</i>. a-head, and of exports about
9<i>l</i>. a-head; and for the new province at the rate of
13<i>l</i>. a-head for imports, and upwards of 17<i>l</i>. a-head
for exports. These averages&mdash;which we need not state are
unequalled by any other community in the world&mdash;exhibit a total
amount of external trade amongst a population of 279,168 persons of
5,839,883<i>l</i>., scattered over the same territory, where,
twenty-one years before, the total external trade of 55,000 people
was not more than 561,941<i>l</i>. While the population has
increased fivefold, the external trade has augmented tenfold.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that these statistical returns were
computed at a period when the gold-deposits had only been worked
six months in New South Wales, and scarcely three months in
Victoria; consequently the value of the precious metal entered on
the export-sheet of either colony forms a small item in the total
amount. Since that period the first year of the gold era has passed
away, and the astounding discoveries and labours of the
gold-diggers have added almost a fabulous amount to the products of
the two colonies under consideration. We are in possession of
intelligence as late as the end of November 1852, which warrants us
in stating that the amount of exports from New South Wales for that
year will be more than treble that of 1851; and the total amount of
gold raised in Victoria will more than be quadruple the amount of
exports for the previous year; while the addition to the population
of the two colonies cannot be less than 100,000. And should the
yield of gold from the Victoria diggings during the latter months
of the past year continue, when sixty thousand diggers were said to
be procuring, at a low average, an ounce per week each man&mdash;we
shall have, at a reasonable computation, during the second year of
the gold-discovery, in this colony alone, a sum not less than 20
millions sterling added to its productive resources. Therefore,
granting that the population of the previous year be doubled, and
all the gold exported&mdash;which is very probable&mdash;this will
give on an average to each individual the power of consuming, for
that year, <i>one hundred pounds</i> value of foreign commodities.
At such a climax our sober statistical calculations are startled
from their propriety; and we leave the reader to speculate upon the
probable returns from the custom-house and the registrar-general's
office in Victoria for 1872.</p>

<p>Besides this increase in the amount of its external trade during
the last twenty years, this territory has shown equally surprising
results as to its capability of producing, to almost an unlimited
extent, every article of luxury or necessity for the support and
comfort of the most civilised communities in the family of mankind.
Australia is just such a country as Napoleon <i>le grand</i>
desired to rule over, so that he could work out his gigantic
schemes of national aggrandisement. Here, under its extraordinary
variety of climate, from Cape York in 11° south latitude to Van
Diemen's Land in 43°, every description of vegetable food can be
produced, from the pine-apple to the potato, from the sugar-cane to
mangel-wurzel; and the raw materials for clothing can be reared,
from the finest silk to the coarsest wool. Its mineral treasures
are likewise unlimited, from coal-measures to gold and diamond
mines. It is needless to pursue these details farther; it is
evident that by developing her internal resources, Australia as a
nation could be independent of all foreign aid in supplying every
necessary and luxury for the maintenance of her people. The stride
these two colonies have made in this respect during the past twenty
years is ample proof of this; and although the gold-discovery has
checked the progress of her enterprising manufacturers, still these
resources are only dormant for a time, doubtless to be again
resumed with tenfold energy; and the wealth acquired by this
universal circulating medium will develop new products hitherto
unknown. In 1830, excepting a few windmills at Sydney, there was
scarcely any thing in the shape of machinery for manufactures in
New South Wales. In 1850, besides a hundred mills of various kinds
for grinding and dressing grain, there were 95 tallow-melting
establishments, which boiled down half a million of sheep and
50,000 head of cattle that year. And of manufactories&mdash;5
distilleries, 24 breweries, 3 sugar-refining, 20 soap and candle,
15 tobacco and snuff, 6 woollen cloth (producing annually 200,000
yards of tweed and broad-cloth,) 4 hat, 4 rope, 40 tanneries, 5
salting and preserving meat establishments, 1 gas-works, 7
potteries, 1 glass-works, 1 smelting-works, 13 iron and brass
foundries. With this list of useful works to train up the rising
generation of colonists in the noble arts and manufactures of the
parent country, we have no fear but there will be a gradual
increase in the industrial pursuits of these colonies during the
next twenty years, commensurate with the increased value of their
products.</p>

<p>So much for the development of its material prosperity during
the past, and the brilliant hopes of the future. While we have an
equally satisfactory result in the increase of the population and
the character of the people during that time, let us endeavour to
see what looms on the social and political horizon of Australia
since the advent of this golden era in her history. We have stated
that the population had increased from 55,000 to 280,000 during
that period within the boundaries of the old colony of New South
Wales. We may add further that the major part of the former
population consisted of prisoners of the crown or emancipated
convicts, and that the sexes were unnaturally disproportioned;
while among the latter there were nineteen-twentieths of them free
people, with an approximation towards an equality of the sexes; and
the relations of society between master and servant were much the
same as they are now in the mother country. So far, then, the
social condition of the community had kept pace in improvement with
the march of its material prosperity. The sudden discovery,
however, of almost illimitable wealth has thrown the social
progress of the colonists as far back in the scale of nations as
they have advanced in commercial importance; and for the time being
the relations which formerly subsisted between the employer and the
employed have been subverted. Those ties which bind the industrious
energies of the labourer and capitalist no longer prevail. Under
this new order of things a universal equality has established
itself amongst the great mass of the people; and those who are for
order and good government are fearful that a state of anarchy will
ensue from this dissevering, as it were, the old bonds of society
under which the colonies prospered.</p>

<p>Already it has begun to show itself in the province of Victoria,
where the desperadoes and scum of all the colonies seem to have
congregated. We have it from an eyewitness, who left Melbourne in
November 1852, and to whose testimony, as an old colonist, we
attach much consideration, that the lawlessness which prevailed at
that time throughout that once peaceful colony was grievous to
record. The offscourings of Van Diemen's Land were roaming about,
committing robberies and murders almost unchecked; while the
pusillanimous conduct of the local government, who had publicly
declared <i>their inability to conduct the administration of
affairs</i>, was reprehended by every right-thinking independent
colonist. And it was rumoured that the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr.
Latrobe, conscious of his unfitness to manage the helm of the
state, had sent in his resignation to the home government. We have
no intention of saying any thing disrespectful of Mr. Latrobe when
we state, that under the circumstances he was not only unequal to
the emergency, but he was behind the intelligent body of the
colonists, who showed themselves able for the occasion. The
narrow-mindedness, to say the least of it, which he has displayed
in grasping at the money which flowed so freely into the treasury,
without a liberal and equivalent expenditure in maintaining a body
of police for the suppression of crime, exhibits a policy entirely
at variance with the British constitution. It is so contrary to the
policy of imperial administrations, who launch out millions of
British money for the maintenance of order in our possessions in
Africa, India, and New Zealand, that we should imagine the present
business Ministry will accept his resignation, and dispatch some
able and active man to the scene of anarchy, armed with full
powers, and an efficient executive, to make these desperadoes feel
that they are under the sway of the British sceptre, and thereby
preserve the lustre of this brightest jewel in England's
diadem.</p>

<p>Besides this change in the former peaceful condition of the
people, another and a grievous alteration has taken place in the
friendly demeanour of the colonists in Victoria. The selfish lust
for gold, and the influx of strangers among the people, has
banished much of that hospitable feeling from the mass of society
which formerly prevailed among the colonists; a feeling which was
nowhere more liberally manifested than among the early residents in
Port Philip. We regret this exceedingly; for it spread a charm over
the rough welcomings which the colonist held forth to the stranger,
that all the treasures of the gold-fields cannot supply, and which
formerly reconciled the emigrant for the loss he sustained in
leaving the friends of his youth behind.</p>

<p>Reverting from this gloomy aspect of affairs, let us glance at
the bright side of the picture. Although we did not deem it our
province in the foregoing narrative to touch in detail upon the
early history of these colonies, and enter more minutely into the
social and political condition of the people, still we have
endeavoured throughout to describe only those phases of individual
character, and the general characteristics of the colonists in
their every-day life, which are based upon the broad principles of
human nature, and which even the revolution in society created by
the gold-discovery cannot alter, however much it may modify. Our
aim has been to sketch the existing condition of these colonies,
with a view to represent the leading features of Australian life
and scenery, so that there can be no mistake in recognising the
picture. And we flatter ourselves that the traveller who journeys
with our book in his hand over the same ground ten or even twenty
years hence, will find our descriptions and remarks true to the
life within their sphere, however great the circle may be
augmented. In our remarks upon the existing state of society, we
have as fearlessly canvassed the past and present as we have
hopefully adverted to the future. And we trust that the reader has
been agreeably surprised to learn, probably for the first time,
from our honest-written words, that there is more of refinement and
high-minded intelligence amongst our fellow-subjects at the
antipodes than he was aware of. And as facts in the history of
Australia prove that individual enterprise has been the mainspring
in developing the resources of the country, so, without boasting,
the Australian colonists may take credit to themselves as a
community, who can stand under any difficulties which may befall
them, that they are quite equal to meet the present emergency, if
their rulers could but enforce authority. Two instances within the
circle of our personal friends in Victoria will serve to illustrate
the indomitable spirit which prevails amongst them.</p>

<p>A squatter possessed of 26,000 sheep, which formerly required
about thirty men to superintend, finds himself suddenly deserted by
all hands, excepting three faithful servants. What does he do in
this predicament, when his flocks are apparently threatened with
ruin? He does not sit down and idly bemoan his fate, and allow his
sheep to stray into the wilderness, but instantly arouses himself,
and strains all his energies to encounter the difficulty; he drives
the whole of his sheep into one spot, and with the aid of his three
trusty adherents, shepherds this monster flock on horseback, taking
the full sweep of his arm for their feeding-ground. Again, our old
friend the editor of the <i>Melbourne Argus</i> one day finds that
all his assistants have "sloped off to the diggings," and he is
left alone with some lads to bring out his daily sheet of news.
What does he do? Sit down in his editorial chair and indite a
hand-bill to announce that, in consequence of being short-handed,
his paper cannot appear on the morrow? No such thing. He at once
unflinchingly applies himself to assist the few who remain in the
task of composing and printing, and sends forth his broadsheet to
the expectant inhabitants not a whit less respectably "got up" than
usual, and detailing his case in his usual racy, good-humoured way.
These are the methods by which our fellow-subjects in Australia
meet their difficulties in the face; and the man who is not equal
to these occasions need not expect to progress in such a go-ahead
community.</p>

<p>With regard to the general state of society in New South Wales
in particular, we have a little more to say; for we are confident
that there is less alteration upon the people of that colony than
in the younger community of Victoria. We think that persons must
have been very unfortunate in their association if they did not
meet with respectable people in Sydney. It would not only be
unjust, but it would be absurd, not to say that there is as good
society in New South Wales as there is in any other community; and
those persons who have spoken against it probably would have a
difficulty in explaining their exact position in their own country.
No doubt in all communities there are objectionable characters; New
South Wales has therefore, in this respect, nothing peculiar to
itself. It was our good fortune not only to avoid coming in contact
with disagreeable people there, but, on the contrary, to make some
valued and respected friends; and we should feel that we were doing
them and ourselves an injustice, if we did not acknowledge their
many kindnesses to us, and express our opinion that there exists
amongst the society of that colony all those refinements which men
value from the charm which they give to life.</p>

<p>As to insecurity of the person, we can but give our experiences.
We have travelled, as the reader will conclude, over many thousand
miles of that territory; we have often bivouacked alone, and we
have taken our chance with the solitary shepherd; and we were
always treated with kindness and civility, often with a liberal
hospitality. The fact of our being alone frequently, and
consequently exposed, while we were never once either insulted or
made uneasy, should be a proof to people that travelling in New
South Wales was as safe as in England. What the future may produce
we are not prepared to say; we speak of our own experiences,
without exaggeration one way or the other. Nay, we may add, what
will perhaps surprise many persons, that we have met with the
greatest civility (often in awkward and solitary places) from that
class who have been exposed to much unfair abuse by those whose
fortunes have, in most instances, been made by, or may be traced to
their labours; we allude to the emancipated convict population of
New South Wales. To be continually pluming oneself upon one's own
virtue, and eternally casting reflections upon those who have been
unfortunate, or&mdash;if people please&mdash;criminal, is not only
unjust, but ungenerous. The rule should be to judge them by their
present acts and general credit for years of good conduct, which
these men almost invariably can show, and not to trouble yourself
further. At any rate, avoid hurting the feelings of men when they
have paid the penalty demanded of them by their country.</p>

<p>If we step from the social threshold of the people of Australia
into the public arena of their political condition, the same
unsettled difficulties meet us on the way. We are none of those
wise politicians who can see further into the millstone of futurity
than other people; at the same time, we venture to say, that the
adjustment of affairs under the new development of the riches of
Australia will press on the consideration of English statesmen the
position of the mother country in relation to these colonies.
Heretofore they have been viewed as <i>belonging to England</i>;
now they will have to be considered as an <i>integral portion of
the British empire</i>. To make them such, they must be represented
in the Imperial Parliament for empire objects. The importance of
conceding to the colonists the rights of Englishmen in managing
their local affairs has been at length admitted. But it has escaped
observation, that unless our dependencies are linked to the empire
by sending deputies to the parliament for imperial objects, this
concession in itself will be, in fact, giving to them the next
thing to their independence. Antagonism must arise between the
distant colony and the mother country in consequence; whereas
representation in the Imperial Parliament would bind them to the
state from whence they derive their importance in the family of
nations, and tend to make the union of the empire perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%">"Taking this general view of the subject,
we proposed, as far back as 1839, that every colony of Englishmen
possessing a British population of a given number should have the
privilege of returning to the House of Commons deputies to
represent their general interests in that house; and that absolute
local legislative control should be accorded to every colony
reaching a certain population, for local purposes.<br>
<br>
"That every individual possessing the requisite qualification for a
member of the Imperial Legislature should be entitled to take his
seat in the House of Commons, provided he should be elected by at
least two-thirds of the Colonial Legislature for that purpose; and
also that any individual in any of our colonies, provided he
possess the requisite qualification, shall be eligible to represent
any given constituency in any part of Great Britain and Ireland in
the British House of Commons.<br>
<br>
"In return for this equitable concession, it is contended that all
colonies, after twenty years' location, should bear their quota of
any charge incurred for the defence of the empire in any future
war, according to a population scale; each colony to raise the same
through her own local legislature. There never was a greater error,
nor a more mischievous statement, than that colonists are reluctant
to bear an <i>equitable</i> share of our national war-burdens;
Englishmen are naturally as ready to consent to that which is fair
and equal, as they are prone to resist injustice. This spirit of
equity is the strength of the empire; and as such it ought to be
carefully cherished.<br>
<br>
"Again, members to sit in Parliament should be elected for a fixed
period of three, five, or seven years, as might be agreed upon, and
not to be determined by any change in the Imperial Parliament;
those members to be chosen by at least two-thirds of the local
legislature. This mode would be preferable to having the members
chosen by the people at large, as it would prevent a difference of
opinion between the members sent to the Imperial Parliament and the
Colonial Legislature. Upon the dissolution of the Imperial
Parliament, of course, the functions of the colonial members to be
in abeyance until a new parliament was assembled. An objection may
be made to this proposal, that it would be against the constitution:
in answer to which, we may challenge the objector to point out in
what respect it is against the constitution, any more than it is to
appoint a member of the Upper House of Parliament as a permanent
legislator. In this respect we may aptly view our constitution as a
scheme of government which accommodates itself to the peace and
happiness of the people at large, and as the power and extension of
the empire may demand. Such rights conceded to our fellow-subjects
in the colonies would make it their interest to continue attached
to the mother country.<br>
<br>
"Every community possesses ambitious men, who are either useful or
mischievous to the state; useful if secured in the enjoyment of
their birthright; mischievous if deprived of it. These men in the
colonies being eligible to fill the highest offices of the state,
would there exercise their talents in a right direction; and they
would no longer feel themselves in a degraded position, but that
they enjoyed all the immunities of free-born Englishmen, while they
would be considered by the British public as part of themselves.
The nation would also have the benefit of hearing the opinions of
men really conversant with colonial questions; men who would
possess the confidence of at least two-thirds of their local house
of representatives, and of a large majority of the colonists. In
the event of war, the most remote of our possessions would be as
enthusiastic for the national honour and for the interests of the
empire as the people of the fatherland. They would consider the
British Isles to be their common country; while the colonies would
offer an outlet for the superabundant population, where they could
enjoy, without restraint, the privileges of their national
institutions.<br>
<br>
"Men born in this country, after taking root in our colonies,
possess the love of fatherland in no ordinary degree, until the
unwise policy of the rulers at home chills their feelings; their
sons, consequently, display cooler regards towards the mother
country; and their sons' sons approach to absolute indifference, if
not aversion.<br>
<br>
"Before the troubles broke out in Spanish America, in the early
part of the present century, the plan of a constitution was laid
before the Cortes by patriotic men in the colonies; the leading
principle of which was to enable the colonists to be possessed of
all and every privilege enjoyed by their fellow-countrymen in
Spain; and also to grant them the right to choose deputies from
amongst their own body to represent their interests in the Imperial
Cortes. The plan was not adopted; and those fatal consequences,
which need not be specified, occurred; and have scarcely left one
colony to that once-splendid empire, which, in earlier periods, was
the wonder and admiration of the world.<br>
<br>
"Let us be warned, both by our own experience and by the experience
of others; and let that which constitutes the perfection of
friendship be made manifest upon the most extensive
scale,&mdash;namely, '<i>that a great many generals be made into
one.</i>'"*</p>

Right to be represented in Parliament." By Thomas Banister, of the

<p>Here then, gentle reader, we must bring our remarks on the past
condition and future prospects of Australia to a close. And as it
has been our aim throughout these pages to entertain as well as to
instruct you in our descriptive narrative and free remarks on these
most important possessions of the British Crown and our
fellow-countrymen, who are working out the destinies of Australia,
we trust that our intention in your case has proved successful.
Imperfect as the foregoing sketch of the undeveloped resources of
these regions has been, there is enough to show that a great future
is in store for the colonists and their posterity in the lands of
Australia. This is no doubtful conjecture, seen in the dim
obscurity of future ages, but it is becoming every day more and
more a bright and palpable fact; not merely in the giant strides of
present progress, when every man's footstep marks its imprint on
<i>sands of gold</i>, but in the position which Australia will
doubtless maintain from her superior wealth and unbounded resources
among the foreign states which now flourish, and others which are
likely to spring into existence on the eastern shores of the mighty
Pacific. The opening-up of this vast ocean to the traffic of the
northern nations will form the grand achievement of the age, as the
navigation of the Atlantic was that of our ancestors three
centuries ago. Already the crushing, resistless momentum of
steam-power has shortened the chain which links the mother country
with her antipodes by one-third; and it will soon sever the slender
neck of land which divides the two oceans, and thus open up an
entrance to that boundless western sea, which laves alike the
gold-coasts of America and Australia. Is there not, therefore, at
the present, reasonable grounds for predicting a great future for
Australia and the Australians? The same energies and sinews are at
work which raised the mighty fabric of the American nation to its
present eminence. Say, then, are we less vigorous in frame, or less
gigantic in mind, than our forefathers were? What they performed on
the western shores of the Atlantic, may not this present generation
of Britons and their descendants achieve upon the western shore of
the Pacific?</p>

<p>In conclusion: the remarks freely scattered throughout the
foregoing pages, commenting upon the progress and vicissitudes of
colonial life in New South Wales and Victoria, will be rendered
more useful and intelligible to the intending colonist, if we
append a few practical observations upon the propriety of his using
great caution and judgment in resolving to venture his fortunes on
that distant shore, and leaving what prospects are before him in
his native country. Of course we do not allude to the emigrant
labourer and mechanic, whom we distinctly assure cannot make a
false step in proceeding thither under any circumstances. It is the
family with limited means, and unaccustomed to hard labour, who
require some cautions and prudent advice; and likewise young men of
dissolute habits in the upper walks of society, who promise
repentance to their parents and guardians if they are assisted to
reach this new field of enterprise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2%">"Amongst the former we have witnessed
much misery and distress, where the thriving tradesman has left a
comparatively flourishing business, and the comfortably situated
office-man has given up an easy appointment and fair salary, for
visions of wealth and independence never to be realised. And sad
indeed have been the regrets of such individuals when they found
that they had thrown up a reasonable certainty for a visionary
uncertainty. The idea of amassing a fortune by a few years' hard
toil and privation, and returning to one's native country to enjoy
it, is no doubt a very delightful result to one's labours; but such
prizes are few compared with the many who are only capable of
earning a living. To all such enthusiasts we earnestly say, be
cautious, particularly if you are surrounded by a young family and
a delicate wife; abandon all Utopian schemes, and think of your
emigrating&mdash;of becoming a good colonist, as simply
transplanting your energies and means to a more profitable and
genial soil, at the same time requiring more than usual exertion
and sacrifice to discover its capabilities. Suppose, in no pursuit
you undertake, that wealth can be obtained but by the same
application, the same perseverance, the same integrity that lead to
success in this country, and you will not be disappointed.<br>
<br>
"With regard to young men of dissolute habits, we have frequently
been consulted by anxious parents on the propriety of disposing of
them, in something like the following terms: 'Here is our son Tom,
a wild youth, who will not settle down quietly to business; he has
lost several advantageous situations through his unsteadiness of
conduct. He is now approaching his majority, and we are anxious to
see him begin the business of the world in earnest. This he
promises faithfully to do, if we only pay his passage out to
Australia, provide him with an ample outfit, and a hundred pounds
or so in his pocket when he lands there. We are inclined to think
favourably of the project, and solicit your advice as to the most
advantageous settlement for him to proceed to.' Our advice in the
majority of cases has been such as to dissuade the parents from
forwarding his views, as it would be tossing him out of the
frying-pan into the fire.<br>
<br>
"Parents who have complied with such requests, during the past
history of Australian and New Zealand emigration, have had much to
regret in the consequences which have ensued. It can be termed
nothing short of family banishment, and is fraught with many evils,
not only to the young men themselves, but to the community they
proceed to. The 'fast' youth, upon reaching the land of is adoption
with a little money in his purse, and finding himself freed from
the vigilant eyes of his friends and relatives, launches recklessly
into all manner of excesses, until he is ruined in health and
pocket. The consequences are most distressing where the man is not
'a law unto himself.' No matter how superior his attainments if this
precept is unheeded, and the grosser passions predominate. In our
experiences, both in New Zealand and Australia, we have witnessed
many distressing cases, where graduates of our
universities&mdash;Cambridge and Oxford men&mdash;have become
victims to their dissolute recklessness, all the more quickly
because in those colonies there was no check on their conduct.
After squandering the means intended for their moral redemption in
some new sphere of action&mdash;frequently a portion of the savings
from the hard-won earnings of an industrious parent&mdash;we have
encountered them in the bush of Australia reduced to the condition
of the common labourer, sometimes even following a menial
occupation; and, in New Zealand, living in domestic savageness upon
the charity of the Maori chiefs. It is true that the families of
such scapegrace sons and brothers have got rid of a bad member of
their households; for they are at such a distance, that they find
it a difficult matter to return. This is but poor recompense for
the degradation their name sustains, and the abandonment of the
prodigal son, probably for life. If young men must 'sow their wild
oats,' at all events let it be under paternal surveillance, for
then they may reap some profitable lessons; whereas the harvest of
their mature years may be disgrace and infamy on these distant
shores. The recent changes in the social condition of these
colonies, instead of presenting an improved field for their
reception, exhibits the contrary; for gold-digging and its
associations are not likely to reform the characters of young and
dissolute adventurers."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "The Gold Regions of Australia." By Samuel
Mossman.]</p>

<p>As regards the steadier class of young men holding respectable
positions in society, such as merchants', bankers', and lawyers'
clerks, shopmen and the like, we trust that the repeated warnings
of their disappointed fellow-clerks who have already reached these
shores, and found themselves mistaken, will be sufficient to deter
others from risking their unskilled and feeble arms in a community
where bodily strength and mechanical talent are the only
<i>desiderata</i>. Cases of actual distress have already been
reported from Melbourne, where young men of this class have been
unable to earn sufficient means at any employment in that city to
meet the enormously increased expenses of living there; while burly
bullock-drivers, water and wood-carriers, and the like, live on the
fat of the land from the proceeds of their rude occupations.</p>

<p>If a person of this class has no intention of going to the
diggings, and he is a married man, we should say, supposing that he
possesses some means, that the best thing for him to do, is to get
himself under cover at as little expense as possible, without
caring for appearances; to be economical in his living, and
immediately to set about taking steps for the future. If he is not
a man to hire himself, he must determine his course without delay;
and he must never forget that every pound spent is a pound lost to
him, ay and more, perhaps at some future day it might increase to
fifty. If he means to go to the diggings, he must resolve to work
hard and suffer privations cheerfully, determined not to be beaten
in his object. His success, certainly, may depend upon Fortune; but
that lady at the diggings generally bestows her favours upon those
who can wash out most cart-loads of earth in a day.</p>

<p>A short time since two young gentlemen called upon us for
information as to how they should proceed on their arrival in the
colonies, as they had resolved upon going to the mines. Their means
were very limited; but they had stout hearts, with strong and
active frames, although not accustomed to labour. We said, after
telling them the description of outfit necessary for such an
enterprise, that we should recommend them, <i>as a matter of
pleasure</i>, to be always ready on board ship to make themselves
useful in hauling at the ropes, assisting at the pumps, and such
like; for as, upon their arrival, they would have to work in
earnest, it would be well for them to be in good working condition,
both body and hands. If they made up their minds to pursue this
course, and were really determined to labour hard, we thought, from
their appearance, that they had a fair chance of succeeding; but we
had made it a rule not to offer a specific piece of advice to any
one going to these colonies; for experience had taught us, that
success depended entirely on the individual himself; and frequently
we had known, when the adventurer failed, he would attach blame to
his adviser. They said, "We understand you perfectly. You think if
it is in us to bear hardships, to persevere under privations,
whatever they may be, and if we possess wit enough to avail
ourselves of the chances which may cross our path, we shall
succeed." "Exactly so," was our reply. And we have no doubt but
that those young men, if they turn out what they appeared to be,
will be among Fortune's favourites.</p>

<p>As it may prove useful to those intending gold-diggers bound for
Mount Alexander, we shall copy the following memorandum for their
guidance, under the existing regulations, from the <i>Melbourne
Herald</i>.</p>

<p>1. Every licensed person must have his license always with him,
ready to be produced whenever demanded by a commissioner, or
persons acting under his instructions, otherwise he is liable to be
proceeded against as an unlicensed person.</p>

<p>2. Every person digging for gold, or occupying land, without a
license, is liable by law to be fined: for a first offence not
exceeding 5<i>l</i>.; for a second offence not exceeding
15<i>l</i>.; and for a subsequent one not exceeding 20<i>l</i>.</p>

<p>3. Digging for gold is not allowed within 16 feet of the edge of
any public road, nor are the roads to be undermined.</p>

<p>4. Tents and buildings are not to be erected within 20 feet of
each other, or within 20 feet of any creek.</p>

<p>5. It is enjoined that all persons at the gold-fields maintain
and assist in maintaining a due observance of the Sundays.

<p>A gold-license is not transferable.</p>

<p>In reference to a question frequently asked by new-comers, it
may be mentioned that each license continues in force until the
first of each month only, whether you take out one at the beginning
or the middle of the month.</p>

<p>In a labouring community like that which inhabits Australia,
where the occupations of the people are almost solely directed to
producing the <i>raw materials</i> for manufactures, it will be
readily supposed by the intelligent reader that individuals skilled
in the higher mechanical arts are less likely to find remunerative
employment than the unskilled labourer, or at all events the demand
for the former is easier supplied than the latter; hence there are
fewer inducements for them to emigrate, should they intend
following their trades. Not only is this the case with the skilful
artisan, but members of the learned professions will find but a
limited sphere for the exercise of their collegiate acquirements.
The physician will not find great scope for his therapeutic talent
in that healthy climate, except in attending upon invalids who have
been recommended to take up their residence there. His greatest
practice in the towns will be in facilitating the entrance into the
world of the future and vastly increasing population of
Anglo-Australians. Few surgical cases occur among the agricultural
and pastoral labouring classes, from the quiet nature of their
occupations; and as they are scattered thinly over the vast
interior, they seldom call in the services of a regular
practitioner, unless the case be of a serious nature. The distance
they have to send or travel for advice is generally so great, that
they either allow their ailments to take the natural course of
recovery, or they obtain a dose of medicine from the medicine-chest
which is to be found upon all well-regulated stations. In fact,
taking the census of the people into consideration, Australia
requires fewer medical men to prescribe for the community, less
bleeding and blistering for her children in these southern
colonies, than in any other country in the world situated so near
the tropical zone. We have no doubt, however, that a skilful
physician, with a knowledge of the latest discoveries in his
profession, may find a practice in some of the cities and largest
towns, as brother professionals very soon retire from active
business, as soon as they acquire a sufficiency to commence some
easier and more lucrative pursuit. The best opening perhaps, in
these gold-digging times, is that before the hardy country surgeon
at or near some of the gold-fields, if he is able to stand the
hardships and privations of a bush life. This new occupation has
increased the amount of medical cases beyond all precedent, and the
doctors (?) at the mines are picking up a golden harvest among the
miners who have been so fortunate as to come off with a few scars
only, or an impaired constitution, without having dug their graves
in these auriferous caverns and wells. Students who have just
graduated, and assistants, who intend leaving the pestle and mortar
on speculation, should remember that this new demand for medical
attendance very probably is supplied by this time; and as more
clerks and shopmen have proceeded to these gold colonies during the
past year than would suffice for the bookkeeping and
counter-jumping in towns with ten times the population, so perhaps
the expectant apothecary may find himself a <i>drug</i> in the
market, even amongst the miners. At all events, a good supply of
those medicines required in the cure of dysentery, ophthalmia, and
similar complaints, it is indispensable to take with him.</p>

<p>To gentlemen of the legal profession who have read these pages
with care, it must have occurred that such a community have not
much time for litigation; hence there are not many fat fees going
in civil cases. But the increased desire of the lucky diggers to
invest their earnings in real property has multiplied the business
of conveyancing; so that a lawyer well versed in this department of
his profession will find a good opening for his talents. English
law is practised at the bar; and a barrister gifted with ordinary
forensic eloquence may find a remunerative opening for his talents
in the supreme courts of Sydney or Melbourne; or if he be skilled
in chamber practice, he may pick up some good fees. An attorney has
more chances of working his way into a profitable business than a
barrister, there being a great many petty courts throughout these
colonies, in which he can practice in either capacity. Under all
circumstances, we would caution legal gentlemen from proceeding
thither upon speculation, unless they are high-class men; inferior
lawyers in either capacity have as little chance of a brief or a
case, once they are known, as they would have in England.</p>

<p>Ministers of the gospel, of course, almost never think of
proceeding to these distant regions without being invited by
particular congregations requiring their services, or, appointed to
churches by their superiors. The governments of New South Wales and
Victoria assist the clergy, ministry, and chiefs of all creeds and
persuasions; so that there is no state church in Australia. Until
lately, properly qualified teachers, both public and private, were
much in request; but the exodus from Britain during the past year
has provided amply for the wants of the colonists, if we are not
mistaken; for they had heard that the rising generation there were
but ill provided in their scholastic institutions, amateurs and
novices filling the highest situations; consequently there has been
a <i>rush</i> to the antipodes from among our Dominies. The female
portion of this ill-requited class in the mother country have
better chances than their male compeers, for they soon get
<i>married off</i>, leaving vacancies for new-comers.</p>

<p>To immigrants who follow the educated professions, we can with
confidence assert, that high-class talent in their vocations is not
only fully appreciated by the colonists, but it is remunerated in
double proportion to inferior ability; for they have become
disgusted with pretenders and empirics. Indeed, from the number of
individuals who have been appointed by the government, as well as
learned universities and courts of judicature, to fill important
offices in these colonies, who have proved themselves unfit for
their duties, the Australian people are now demanding a voice in
their elections; and from the bold and just manner in which it has
been put by the independent legislators of New South Wales, that
colony may soon expect the Secretary of State to concede a portion
of their privileges demanded. That old familiar saw, the "dregs
fall to the wicked," has been too much acted upon hitherto by the
imperial government and the British public in all that relates to
the social and political condition of this group of colonies; they
have been treated, too often, as a sort of moral dust-bin, a
receptacle for the sweepings of learned chambers and Downing-street
incapables, as well as Pentonville prisons. Even the merchant and
ship-owner, until lately considered that any thing was good enough
to send there in the shape of merchandise or ships; any old
<i>tub</i> was deemed sea-worthy for the trade; and the cargoes of
hardware, soft-goods, teas, sugars, wines and spirits were too
frequently the veriest trash and old-stock sweepings from their
warehouses, for which they expected to receive the highest prices.
Experience has since taught them to their cost, that the colonists
prefer the best article, for which they are able and willing to pay
the highest prices, and that first-class vessels will always
command the highest rates of passage-money and freight. We trust
that the Colonial Office will take a leaf out of the merchant's
journal in this respect, and send better men in future to conduct
the general government business of these two most important
colonies; for at present, under the peculiar circumstances which
have come over the dependencies of New South Wales and Victoria, it
is notorious that the major part of the badly-paid officials who
have remained in office since the gold-discovery are remarkable
only for their incompetency, from the governor of a colony down to
a tide-waiter in the customs department.</p>

<p>As it is a matter of some importance for intending colonists
possessed of capital to ascertain the safest channel through which
to transmit their money to Sydney or Melbourne, we recommend them
to take letters of credit upon the local branch banks in preference
to any other way. Mr. Howitt, the well-known author, has published
extensively through the press, the loss he sustained by taking
Bank-of-England notes with him to Melbourne; and we have it from
good authority, that the gold in the coffers of the banks is so
much greater than the circulation of notes, that the colonists are
apprehensive of a depreciation in the value of the sovereign,
should the influx of gold coin in 1852 be continued throughout the
present year; while the local one-pound note will always command
twenty shillings. Many of our readers will be surprised to learn
that banknotes, cheques, and silver, constitute 90 per cent of the
currency in Australia; it is rarely you meet with the sovereign in
common circulation. The fact is, that paper currency is more
convenient than gold for ordinary purposes; and as the colonists
have always had full faith in the stability of the two
old-established Anglo-Australian banks&mdash;the Bank of
Australasia, and the Union Bank of Australia&mdash;which are
conducted on the Scottish banking system, they consider their notes
to be as safe as gold. These two banks have their head-offices in
London&mdash;the Bank of Australasia at 8 Austin Friars, and the
Union Bank of Australia at 38 Old Broad street&mdash;where they
grant letters of credit upon their branch establishments throughout
the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, at the rate of 3 per
cent premium for drafts at sight and 2½ at 30 days after sight;
these drafts are cashed in gold, silver, or bank-notes, as the
receiver may demand.</p>
