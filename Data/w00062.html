  <h2><a id="fore"
     name="fore">FOREWORD</a></h2>

  <p class="intro">THE spell of the desert comes back to me, as it always will
  come. I see the veils, like purple smoke, in the canyon, and I feel the
  silence. And it seems that again I must try to pierce both and to get at the
  strange wild life of the last American wilderness&mdash;wild still, almost,
  as it ever was.</p>

  <p class="intro">While this romance is an independent story, yet readers of
  "Riders of the Purple Sage" will find in it an answer to a question often
  asked.</p>

  <p class="intro">I wish to say also this story has appeared serially in a
  different form in one of the monthly magazines under the title of "The Desert
  Crucible."</p>

  <p class="intro">Zane Grey. June, 1915.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I.</a> &mdash; RED LAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD halted his tired horse and gazed with slowly
  realizing eyes.</p>

  <p>A league-long slope of sage rolled and billowed down to Red Lake, a dry
  red basin, denuded and glistening, a hollow in the desert, a lonely and
  desolate door to the vast, wild, and broken upland beyond.</p>

  <p>All day Shefford had plodded onward with the clear horizon-line a thing
  unattainable; and for days before that he had ridden the wild bare flats and
  climbed the rocky desert benches. The great colored reaches and steps had led
  endlessly onward and upward through dim and deceiving distance.</p>

  <p>A hundred miles of desert travel, with its mistakes and lessons and
  intimations, had not prepared him for what he now saw. He beheld what seemed
  a world that knew only magnitude. Wonder and awe fixed his gaze, and thought
  remained aloof. Then that dark and unknown northland flung a menace at him.
  An irresistible call had drawn him to this seamed and peaked border of
  Arizona, this broken battlemented wilderness of Utah upland; and at first
  sight they frowned upon him, as if to warn him not to search for what lay
  hidden beyond the ranges. But Shefford thrilled with both fear and
  exultation. That was the country which had been described to him. Far across
  the red valley, far beyond the ragged line of black mesa and yellow range,
  lay the wild canyon with its haunting secret.</p>

  <p>Red Lake must be his Rubicon. Either he must enter the unknown to seek, to
  strive, to find, or turn back and fail and never know and be always haunted.
  A friend's strange story had prompted his singular journey; a beautiful
  rainbow with its mystery and promise had decided him. Once in his life he had
  answered a wild call to the kingdom of adventure within him, and once in his
  life he had been happy. But here in the horizon-wide face of that up-flung
  and cloven desert he grew cold; he faltered even while he felt more fatally
  drawn.</p>

  <p>As if impelled Shefford started his horse down the sandy trail, but he
  checked his former far-reaching gaze. It was the month of April, and the
  waning sun lost heat and brightness. Long shadows crept down the slope ahead
  of him and the scant sage deepened its gray. He watched the lizards shoot
  like brown streaks across the sand, leaving their slender tracks; he heard
  the rustle of pack-rats as they darted into their brushy homes; the whir of a
  low-sailing hawk startled his horse.</p>

  <p>Like ocean waves the slope rose and fell, its hollows choked with sand,
  its ridge-tops showing scantier growth of sage and grass and weed. The last
  ridge was a sand-dune, beautifully ribbed and scalloped and lined by the
  wind, and from its knife-sharp crest a thin wavering sheet of sand blew,
  almost like smoke. Shefford wondered why the sand looked red at a distance,
  for here it seemed almost white. It rippled everywhere, clean and glistening,
  always leading down.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Shefford became aware of a house looming out of the bareness of
  the slope. It dominated that long white incline. Grim, lonely, forbidding,
  how strangely it harmonized with the surroundings! The structure was octagon-
  shaped, built of uncut stone, and resembled a fort. There was no door on the
  sides exposed to Shefford's gaze, but small apertures two-thirds the way up
  probably served as windows and port-holes. The roof appeared to be made of
  poles covered with red earth.</p>

  <p>Like a huge cold rock on a wide plain this house stood there on the windy
  slope. It was an outpost of the trader Presbrey, of whom Shefford had heard
  at Flagstaff and Tuba. No living thing appeared in the limit of Shefford's
  vision. He gazed shudderingly at the unwelcoming habitation, at the dark
  eyelike windows, at the sweep of barren slope merging into the vast red
  valley, at the bold, bleak bluffs. Could any one live here? The nature of
  that sinister valley forbade a home there, and the, spirit of the place
  hovered in the silence and space. Shefford thought irresistibly of how his
  enemies would have consigned him to just such a hell. He thought bitterly and
  mockingly of the narrow congregation that had proved him a failure in the
  ministry, that had repudiated his ideas of religion and immortality and God,
  that had driven him, at the age of twenty-four, from the calling forced upon
  him by his people. As a boy he had yearned to make himself an artist; his
  family had made him a clergyman; fate had made him a failure. A failure only
  so far in his life, something urged him to add&mdash;for in the lonely days
  and silent nights of the desert he had experienced a strange birth of hope.
  Adventure had called him, but it was a vague and spiritual hope, a dream of
  promise, a nameless attainment that fortified his wilder impulse.</p>

  <p>As he rode around a corner of the stone house his horse snorted and
  stopped. A lean, shaggy pony jumped at sight of him, almost displacing a red
  long-haired blanket that covered an Indian saddle. Quick thuds of hoofs in
  sand drew Shefford's attention to a corral made of peeled poles, and here he
  saw another pony.</p>

  <p>Shefford heard subdued voices. He dismounted and walked to an open door.
  In the dark interior he dimly descried a high counter, a stairway, a pile of
  bags of flour, blankets, and silver-ornamented objects, but the persons he
  had heard were not in that part of the house. Around another corner of the
  octagon- shaped wall he found another open door, and through it saw
  goat-skins and a mound of dirty sheep-wool, black and brown and white. It was
  light in this part of the building. When he crossed the threshold he was
  astounded to see a man struggling with a girl&mdash;an Indian girl. She was
  straining back from him, panting, and uttering low guttural sounds. The man's
  face was corded and dark with passion. This scene affected Shefford
  strangely. Primitive emotions were new to him.</p>

  <p>Before Shefford could speak the girl broke loose and turned to flee. She
  was an Indian and this place was the uncivilized desert, but Shefford knew
  terror when he saw it. Like a dog the man rushed after her. It was instinct
  that made Shefford strike, and his blow laid the man flat. He lay stunned a
  moment, then raised himself to a sitting posture, his hand to his face, and
  the gaze he fixed upon Shefford seemed to combine astonishment and rage.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're not Presbrey," said Shefford, slowly. He felt awkward, not
  sure of himself.</p>

  <p>The man appeared about to burst into speech, but repressed it. There was
  blood on his mouth and his hand. Hastily he scrambled to his feet. Shefford
  saw this man's amaze and rage change to shame. He was tall and rather stout;
  he had a smooth tanned face, soft of outline, with a weak chin; his eyes were
  dark. The look of him and his corduroys and his soft shoes gave Shefford an
  impression that he was not a man who worked hard. By contrast with the few
  other worn and rugged desert men Shefford had met this stranger stood out
  strikingly. He stooped to pick up a soft felt hat and, jamming it on his
  head, he hurried out. Shefford followed him and watched him from the door. He
  went directly to the corral, mounted the pony, and rode out, to turn down the
  slope toward the south. When he reached the level of the basin, where
  evidently the sand was hard, he put the pony to a lope and gradually drew
  away.</p>

  <p>"Well!" ejaculated Shefford. He did not know what to make of this
  adventure. Presently he became aware that the Indian girl was sitting on a
  roll of blankets near the wall. With curious interest Shefford studied her
  appearance. She had long, raven-black hair, tangled and disheveled, and she
  wore a soiled white band of cord above her brow. The color of her face struck
  him; it was dark, but not red nor bronzed; it almost had a tinge of gold. Her
  profile was clear-cut, bold, almost stern. Long black eyelashes hid her eyes.
  She wore a tight-fitting waist garment of material resembling velveteen. It
  was ripped along her side, exposing a skin still more richly gold than that
  of her face. A string of silver ornaments and turquoise-and-white beads
  encircled her neck, and it moved gently up and down with the heaving of her
  full bosom. Her skirt was some gaudy print goods, torn and stained and dusty.
  She had little feet, incased in brown moccasins, fitting like gloves and
  buttoning over the ankles with silver coins.</p>

  <p>"Who was that man? Did he hurt you?" inquired Shefford, turning to gaze
  down the valley where a moving black object showed on the bare sand.</p>

  <p>"No savvy," replied the Indian girl.</p>

  <p>"Where's the trader Presbrey?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>She pointed straight down into the red valley.</p>

  <p>"Toh," she said.</p>

  <p>In the center of the basin lay a small pool of water shining brightly in
  the sunset glow. Small objects moved around it, so small that Shefford
  thought he saw several dogs led by a child. But it was the distance that
  deceived him. There was a man down there watering his horses. That reminded
  Shefford of the duty owing to his own tired and thirsty beast. Whereupon he
  untied his pack, took off the saddle, and was about ready to start down when
  the Indian girl grasped the bridle from his hand.</p>

  <p>"Me go," she said.</p>

  <p>He saw her eyes then, and they made her look different. They were as black
  as her hair. He was puzzled to decide whether or not he thought her
  handsome.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, but I'll go," he replied, and, taking the bridle again, he
  started down the slope. At every step he sank into the deep, soft sand. Down
  a little way he came upon a pile of tin cans; they were everywhere, buried,
  half buried, and lying loose; and these gave evidence of how the trader
  lived. Presently Shefford discovered that the Indian girl was following him
  with her own pony. Looking upward at her against the light, he thought her
  slender, lithe, picturesque. At a distance he liked her.</p>

  <p>He plodded on, at length glad to get out of the drifts of sand to the hard
  level floor of the valley. This, too, was sand, but dried and baked hard, and
  red in color. At some season of the year this immense flat must be covered
  with water. How wide it was, and empty! Shefford experienced again a feeling
  that had been novel to him&mdash;and it was that he was loose, free,
  unanchored, ready to veer with the wind. From the foot of the slope the water
  hole had appeared to be a few hundred rods out in the valley. But the small
  size of the figures made Shefford doubt; and he had to travel many times a
  few hundred rods before those figures began to grow. Then Shefford made out
  that they were approaching him.</p>

  <p>Thereafter they rapidly increased to normal proportions of man and beast.
  When Shefford met them he saw a powerful, heavily built young man leading two
  ponies.</p>

  <p>"You're Mr. Presbrey, the trader?" inquired Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm Presbrey, without the Mister," he replied.</p>

  <p>"My name's Shefford. I'm knocking about on the desert. Rode from beyond
  Tuba to-day."</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you," said Presbrey. He offered his hand. He was a stalwart
  man, clad in gray shirt, overalls, and boots. A shock of tumbled light hair
  covered his massive head; he was tanned, but not darkly, and there was red in
  his cheeks; under his shaggy eyebrows were deep, keen eyes; his lips were
  hard and set, as if occasion for smiles or words was rare; and his big,
  strong jaw seemed locked.</p>

  <p>"Wish more travelers came knocking around Red Lake," he added. "Reckon
  here's the jumping-off place."</p>

  <p>"It's pretty&mdash;lonesome," said Shefford, hesitating as if at a loss
  for words.</p>

  <p>Then the Indian girl came up. Presbrey addressed her in her own language,
  which Shefford did not understand. She seemed shy and would not answer; she
  stood with downcast face and eyes. Presbrey spoke again, at which she pointed
  down the valley, and then moved on with her pony toward the water-hole.</p>

  <p>Presbrey's keen eyes fixed on the receding black dot far down that oval
  expanse.</p>

  <p>"That fellow left&mdash;rather abruptly," said Shefford, constrainedly.
  "Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"His name's Willetts. He's a missionary. He rode in to-day with this
  Navajo girl. He was taking her to Blue Canyon, where he lives and teaches the
  Indians. I've met him only a few times. You see, not many white men ride in
  here. He's the first white man I've seen in six months, and you're the
  second. Both the same day!... Red Lake's getting popular! It's queer, though,
  his leaving. He expected to stay all night. There's no other place to stay.
  Blue Canyon is fifty miles away."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to say&mdash;no, I'm not sorry, either&mdash;but I must tell
  you I was the cause of Mr. Willetts leaving," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"How so?" inquired the other.</p>

  <p>Then Shefford related the incident following his arrival.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps my action was hasty," he concluded, apologetically. "I didn't
  think. Indeed, I'm surprised at myself."</p>

  <p>Presbrey made no comment and his face was as hard to read as one of the
  distant bluffs.</p>

  <p>"But what did the man mean?" asked Shefford, conscious of a little heat.
  "I'm a stranger out here. I'm ignorant of Indians&mdash;how they're
  controlled. Still I'm no fool... If Willetts didn't mean evil, at least he
  was brutal."</p>

  <p>"He was teaching her religion," replied Presbrey. His tone held faint
  scorn and implied a joke, but his face did not change in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Without understanding just why, Shefford felt his conviction justified and
  his action approved. Then he was sensible of a slight shock of wonder and
  disgust.</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;I was a minister of the Gospel," he said to Presbrey. "What
  you hint seems impossible. I can't believe it."</p>

  <p>"I didn't hint," replied Presbrey, bluntly, and it was evident that he was
  a sincere, but close-mouthed, man. "Shefford, so you're a preacher?... Did
  you come out here to try to convert the Indians?"</p>

  <p>"No. I said I WAS a minister. I am no longer. I'm just a&mdash;a
  wanderer."</p>

  <p>"I see. Well, the desert's no place for missionaries, but it's good for
  wanderers... Go water your horse and take him up to the corral. You'll find
  some hay for him. I'll get grub ready."</p>

  <p>Shefford went on with his horse to the pool. The water appeared thick,
  green, murky, and there was a line of salty crust extending around the margin
  of the pool. The thirsty horse splashed in and eagerly bent his head. But he
  did not like the taste. Many times he refused to drink, yet always lowered
  his nose again. Finally he drank, though not his fill. Shefford saw the
  Indian girl drink from her hand. He scooped up a handful and found it too
  sour to swallow. When he turned to retrace his steps she mounted her pony and
  followed him.</p>

  <p>A golden flare lit up the western sky, and silhouetted dark and lonely
  against it stood the trading-post. Upon his return Shefford found the wind
  rising, and it chilled him. When he reached the slope thin gray sheets of
  sand were blowing low, rising, whipping, falling, sweeping along with soft
  silken rustle. Sometimes the gray veils hid his boots. It was a long,
  toilsome climb up that yielding, dragging ascent, and he had already been
  lame and tired. By the time he had put his horse away twilight was everywhere
  except in the west. The Indian girl left her pony in the corral and came like
  a shadow toward the house.</p>

  <p>Shefford had difficulty in finding the foot of the stairway. He climbed to
  enter a large loft, lighted by two lamps. Presbrey was there, kneading
  biscuit dough in a pan.</p>

  <p>"Make yourself comfortable," he said.</p>

  <p>The huge loft was the shape of a half-octagon. A door opened upon the
  valley side, and here, too, there were windows. How attractive the place was
  in comparison with the impressions gained from the outside! The furnishings
  consisted of Indian blankets on the floor, two beds, a desk and table,
  several chairs and a couch, a gun-rack full of rifles, innumerable
  silver-ornamented belts, bridles, and other Indian articles upon the walls,
  and in one corner a wood-burning stove with teakettle steaming, and a great
  cupboard with shelves packed full of canned foods.</p>

  <p>Shefford leaned in the doorway and looked out. Beneath him on a roll of
  blankets sat the Indian girl, silent and motionless. He wondered what was in
  her mind, what she would do, how the trader would treat her. The slope now
  was a long slant of sheeted moving shadows of sand. Dusk had gathered in the
  valley. The bluffs loomed beyond. A pale star twinkled above. Shefford
  suddenly became aware of the intense nature of the stillness about him. Yet,
  as he listened to this silence, he heard an intermittent and immeasurably low
  moan, a fitful, mournful murmur. Assuredly it was only the wind.
  Nevertheless, it made his blood run cold. It was a different wind from that
  which had made music under the eaves of his Illinois home. This was a lonely,
  haunting wind, with desert hunger in it, and more which he could not name.
  Shefford listened to this spirit-brooding sound while he watched night
  envelop the valley. How black, how thick the mantle! Yet it brought no
  comforting sense of close-folded protection, of walls of soft sleep, of a
  home. Instead there was the feeling of space, of emptiness, of an infinite
  hall down which a mournful wind swept streams of murmuring sand.</p>

  <p>"Well, grub's about ready," said Presbrey.</p>

  <p>"Got any water?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Sure. There in the bucket. It's rain-water. I have a tank here."</p>

  <p>Shefford's sore and blistered face felt better after he had washed off the
  sand and alkali dust.</p>

  <p>"Better not wash your face often while you're in the desert. Bad plan,"
  went on Presbrey, noting how gingerly his visitor had gone about his
  ablutions. "Well, come and eat."</p>

  <p>Shefford marked that if the trader did live a lonely life he fared well.
  There was more on the table than twice two men could have eaten. It was the
  first time in four days that Shefford had sat at a table, and he made up for
  lost opportunity.</p>

  <p>His host's actions indicated pleasure, yet the strange, hard face never
  relaxed, never changed. When the meal was finished Presbrey declined
  assistance, had a generous thought of the Indian girl, who, he said, could
  have a place to eat and sleep down-stairs, and then with the skill and
  despatch of an accomplished housewife cleared the table, after which work he
  filled a pipe and evidently prepared to listen.</p>

  <p>It took only one question for Shefford to find that the trader was starved
  for news of the outside world; and for an hour Shefford fed that appetite,
  even as he had been done by. But when he had talked himself out there seemed
  indication of Presbrey being more than a good listener.</p>

  <p>"How'd you come in?" he asked, presently.</p>

  <p>"By Flagstaff&mdash;across the Little Colorado&mdash;and through
  Moencopie."</p>

  <p>"Did you stop at Moen Ave?"</p>

  <p>"No. What place is that?"</p>

  <p>"A missionary lives there. Did you stop at Tuba?"</p>

  <p>"Only long enough to drink and water my horse. That was a wonderful spring
  for the desert."</p>

  <p>"You said you were a wanderer... Do you want a job? I'll give you
  one."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Presbrey."</p>

  <p>"I saw your pack. That's no pack to travel with in this country. Your
  horse won't last, either. Have you any money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, plenty of money."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's good. Not that a white man out here would ever take a dollar
  from you. But you can buy from the Indians as you go. Where are you making
  for, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>Shefford hesitated, debating in mind whether to tell his purpose or not.
  His host did not press the question.</p>

  <p>"I see. Just foot-loose and wandering around," went on Presbrey. "I can
  understand how the desert appeals to you. Preachers lead easy, safe, crowded,
  bound lives. They're shut up in a church with a Bible and good people. When
  once in a lifetime they get loose&mdash;they break out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've broken out&mdash;beyond all bounds," replied Shefford, sadly.
  He seemed retrospective for a moment, unaware of the trader's keen and
  sympathetic glance, and then he caught himself. "I want to see some wild
  life. Do you know the country north of here?"</p>

  <p>"Only what the Navajos tell me. And they're not much to talk. There's a
  trail goes north, but I've never traveled it. It's a new trail every time an
  Indian goes that way, for here the sand blows and covers old tracks. But few
  Navajos ride in from the north. My trade is mostly with Indians up and down
  the valley."</p>

  <p>"How about water and grass?"</p>

  <p>"We've had rain and snow. There's sure to be, water. Can't say about
  grass, though the sheep and ponies from the north are always fat... But, say,
  Shefford, if you'll excuse me for advising you&mdash;don't go north."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Shefford, and it was certain that he thrilled.</p>

  <p>"It's unknown country, terribly broken, as you can see from here, and
  there are bad Indians biding in the canyon. I've never met a man who had been
  over the pass between here and Kayenta. The trip's been made, so there must
  be a trail. But it's a dangerous trip for any man, let alone a tenderfoot.
  You're not even packing a gun."</p>

  <p>"What's this place Kayenta?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"It's a spring. Kayenta means Bottomless Spring. There's a little trading-
  post, the last and the wildest in northern Arizona. Withers, the trader who
  keeps it, hauls his supplies in from Colorado and New Mexico. He's never come
  down this way. I never saw him. Know nothing of him except hearsay. Reckon
  he's a nervy and strong man to hold that post. If you want to go there,
  better go by way of Keams Canyon, and then around the foot of Black Mesa.
  It'll be a long ride&mdash;maybe two hundred miles."</p>

  <p>"How far straight north over the pass?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say. Upward of seventy-five miles over rough trails, if there are
  trails at all... I've heard rumors of a fine tribe of Navajos living in
  there, rich in sheep and horses. It may be true and it may not. But I do know
  there are bad Indians, half-breeds and outcasts, hiding in there. Some of
  them have visited me here. Bad customers! More than that, you'll be going
  close to the Utah line, and the Mormons over there are unfriendly these
  days."</p>

  <p>"Why?" queried Shefford, again with that curious thrill.</p>

  <p>"They are being persecuted by the government."</p>

  <p>Shefford asked no more questions and his host vouchsafed no more
  information on that score. The conversation lagged. Then Shefford inquired
  about the Indian girl and learned that she lived up the valley somewhere.
  Presbrey had never seen her before Willetts came with her to Red Lake. And
  this query brought out the fact that Presbrey was comparatively new to Red
  Lake and vicinity. Shefford wondered why a lonely six months there had not
  made the trader old in experience. Probably the desert did not readily give
  up its secrets. Moreover, this Red Lake house was only an occasionally used
  branch of Presbrey's main trading-post, which was situated at Willow Springs,
  fifty miles westward over the mesa.</p>

  <p>"I'm closing up here soon for a spell," said Presbrey, and now his face
  lost its set hardness and seemed singularly changed. It was a difference, of
  light and softness. "Won't be so lonesome over at Willow Springs... I'm being
  married soon."</p>

  <p>"That's fine," replied Shefford, warmly. He was glad for the sake of this
  lonely desert man. What good a wife would bring into a trader's life!</p>

  <p>Presbrey's naive admission, however, appeared to detach him from his
  present surroundings, and with his massive head enveloped by a cloud of smoke
  he lived in dreams.</p>

  <p>Shefford respected his host's serene abstraction. Indeed, he was grateful
  for silence. Not for many nights had the past impinged so closely upon the
  present. The wound in his soul had not healed, and to speak of himself made
  it bleed anew. Memory was too poignant; the past was too close; he wanted to
  forget until he had toiled into the heart of this forbidding wilderness
  &mdash;until time had gone by and he dared to face his unquiet soul. Then he
  listened to the steadily rising roar of the wind. How strange and hollow!
  That wind was freighted with heavy sand, and he heard it sweep, sweep, sweep
  by in gusts, and then blow with dull, steady blast against the walls. The
  sound was provocative of thought. This moan and rush of wind was no dream
  &mdash;this presence of his in a night-enshrouded and sand-besieged house of
  the lonely desert was reality&mdash;this adventure was not one of fancy. True
  indeed, then, must be the wild, strange story that had led him hither. He was
  going on to seek, to strive, to find. Somewhere northward in the broken
  fastnesses lay hidden a valley walled in from the world. Would they be there,
  those lost fugitives whose story had thrilled him? After twelve years would
  she be alive, a child grown to womanhood in the solitude of a beautiful
  canyon? Incredible! Yet he believed his friend's story and he indeed knew how
  strange and tragic life was. He fancied he heard her voice on the sweeping
  wind. She called to him, haunted him. He admitted the improbability of her
  existence, but lost nothing of the persistent intangible hope that drove him.
  He believed himself a man stricken in soul, unworthy, through doubt of God,
  to minister to the people who had banished him. Perhaps a labor of Hercules,
  a mighty and perilous work of rescue, the saving of this lost and imprisoned
  girl, would help him in his trouble. She might be his salvation. Who could
  tell? Always as a boy and as a man he had fared forth to find the treasure at
  the foot of the rainbow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II.</a> &mdash; THE SAGI</h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning the Indian girl was gone and the tracks of her
  pony led north. Shefford's first thought was to wonder if he would overtake
  her on the trail; and this surprised him with the proof of how unconsciously
  his resolve to go on had formed.</p>

  <p>Presbrey made no further attempt to turn Shefford back. But he insisted on
  replenishing the pack, and that Shefford take weapons. Finally Shefford was
  persuaded to accept a revolver. The trader bade him good-by and stood in the
  door while Shefford led his horse down the slope toward the water-hole.
  Perhaps the trader believed he was watching the departure of a man who would
  never return. He was still standing at the door of the post when Shefford
  halted at the pool.</p>

  <p>Upon the level floor of the valley lay thin patches of snow which had
  fallen during the night. The air was biting cold, yet stimulated Shefford
  while it stung him. His horse drank rather slowly and disgustedly. Then
  Shefford mounted and reluctantly turned his back upon the trading-post.</p>

  <p>As he rode away from the pool he saw a large flock of sheep approaching.
  They were very closely, even densely, packed, in a solid slow-moving mass and
  coming with a precision almost like a march. This fact surprised Shefford,
  for there was not an Indian in sight. Presently he saw that a dog was leading
  the flock, and a little later he discovered another dog in the rear of the
  sheep. They were splendid, long-haired dogs, of a wild-looking shepherd
  breed. He halted his horse to watch the procession pass by. The flock covered
  fully an acre of ground and the sheep were black, white, and brown. They
  passed him, making a little pattering roar on the hard-caked sand. The dogs
  were taking the sheep in to water.</p>

  <p>Shefford went on and was drawing close to the other side of the basin,
  where the flat red level was broken by rising dunes and ridges, when he
  espied a bunch of ponies. A shrill whistle told him that they had seen him.
  They were wild, shaggy, with long manes and tails. They stopped, threw up
  their heads, and watched him. Shefford certainly returned the attention.
  There was no Indian with them. Presently, with a snort, the leader, which
  appeared to be a stallion, trotted behind the others, seemed to be driving
  them, and went clear round the band to get in the lead again. He was taking
  them in to water, the same as the dogs had taken the sheep.</p>

  <p>These incidents were new and pleasing to Shefford. How ignorant he had
  been of life in the wilderness! Once more he received subtle intimations of
  what he might learn out in the open; and it was with a less weighted heart
  that he faced the gateway between the huge yellow bluffs on his left and the
  slow rise of ground to the black mesa on his right. He looked back in time to
  see the trading-post, bleak and lonely on the bare slope, pass out of sight
  behind the bluffs. Shefford felt no fear&mdash;he really had little
  experience of physical fear&mdash;but it was certain that he gritted his
  teeth and welcomed whatever was to come to him. He had lived a narrow,
  insulated life with his mind on spiritual things; his family and his
  congregation and his friends&mdash;except that one new friend whose story had
  enthralled him&mdash;were people of quiet religious habit; the man deep down
  in him had never had a chance. He breathed hard as he tried to imagine the
  world opening to him, and almost dared to be glad for the doubt that had sent
  him adrift.</p>

  <p>The tracks of the Indian girl's pony were plain in the sand. Also there
  were other tracks, not so plain, and these Shefford decided had been made by
  Willetts and the girl the day before. He climbed a ridge, half soft sand and
  half hard, and saw right before him, rising in striking form, two great
  yellow buttes, like elephant legs. He rode between them, amazed at their
  height. Then before him stretched a slowly ascending valley, walled on one
  side by the black mesa and on the other by low bluffs. For miles a dark-green
  growth of greasewood covered the valley, and Shefford could see where the
  green thinned and failed, to give place to sand. He trotted his horse and
  made good time on this stretch.</p>

  <p>The day contrasted greatly with any he had yet experienced. Gray clouds
  obscured the walls of rock a few miles to the west, and Shefford saw squalls
  of snow like huge veils dropping down and spreading out. The wind cut with
  the keenness of a knife. Soon he was chilled to the bone. A squall swooped
  and roared down upon him, and the wind that bore the driving white pellets of
  snow, almost like hail, was so freezing bitter cold that the former wind
  seemed warm in comparison. The squall passed as swiftly as it had come, and
  it left Shefford so benumbed he could not hold the bridle. He tumbled off his
  horse and walked. By and by the sun came out and soon warmed him and melted
  the thin layer of snow on the sand. He was still on the trail of the Indian
  girl, but hers were now the only tracks he could see.</p>

  <p>All morning he gradually climbed, with limited view, until at last he
  mounted to a point where the country lay open to his sight on all sides
  except where the endless black mesa ranged on into the north. A rugged yellow
  peak dominated the landscape to the fore, but it was far away. Red and jagged
  country extended westward to a huge flat-topped wall of gray rock. Lowering
  swift clouds swept across the sky, like drooping mantles, and darkened the
  sun. Shefford built a little fire out of dead greasewood sticks, and with his
  blanket round his shoulders he hung over the blaze, scorching his clothes and
  hands. He had been cold before in his life but he had never before
  appreciated fire. This desert blast pierced him. The squall enveloped him,
  thicker and colder and windier than the other, but, being better fortified,
  he did not suffer so much. It howled away, hiding the mesa and leaving a
  white desert behind. Shefford walked on, leading his horse, until the
  exercise and the sun had once more warmed him.</p>

  <p>This last squall had rendered the Indian girl's trail difficult to follow.
  The snow did not quickly melt, and, besides, sheep tracks and the tracks of
  horses gave him trouble, until at last he was compelled to admit that he
  could not follow her any longer. A faint path or trail led north, however,
  and, following that, he soon forgot the girl. Every surmounted ridge held a
  surprise for him. The desert seemed never to change in the vast whole that
  encompassed him, yet near him it was always changing. From Red Lake he had
  seen a peaked, walled, and canyoned country, as rough as a stormy sea; but
  when he rode into that country the sharp and broken features held to the
  distance.</p>

  <p>He was glad to get out of the sand. Long narrow flats, gray with grass and
  dotted with patches of greasewood, and lined by low bare ridges of yellow
  rock, stretched away from him, leading toward the yellow peak that seemed
  never to be gained upon.</p>

  <p>Shefford had pictures in his mind, pictures of stone walls and wild
  valleys and domed buttes, all of which had been painted in colorful and vivid
  words by his friend Venters. He believed he would recognize the distinctive
  and remarkable landmarks Venters had portrayed, and he was certain that he
  had not yet come upon one of them. This was his second lonely day of travel
  and he had grown more and more susceptible to the influence of horizon and
  the different prominent points. He attributed a gradual change in his
  feelings to the loneliness and the increasing wildness. Between Tuba and
  Flagstaff he had met Indians and an occasional prospector and teamster. Here
  he was alone, and though he felt some strange gladness, he could not help but
  see the difference.</p>

  <p>He rode on during the gray, lowering, chilly day, and toward evening the
  clouds broke in the west, and a setting sun shone through the rift,
  burnishing the desert to red and gold. Shefford's instinctive but deadened
  love of the beautiful in nature stirred into life, and the moment of its
  rebirth was a melancholy and sweet one. Too late for the artist's work, but
  not too late for his soul!</p>

  <p>For a place to make camp he halted near a low area of rock that lay like
  an island in a sea of grass. There was an abundance of dead greasewood for a
  camp-fire, and, after searching over the rock, he found little pools of
  melted snow in the depressions. He took off the saddle and pack, watered his
  horse, and, hobbling him as well as his inexperience permitted, he turned him
  loose on the grass.</p>

  <p>Then while he built a fire and prepared a meal the night came down upon
  him. In the lee of the rock he was well sheltered from the wind, but the air,
  was bitter cold. He gathered all the dead greasewood in the vicinity,
  replenished the fire, and rolled in his blanket, back to the blaze. The
  loneliness and the coyotes did not bother him this night. He was too tired
  and cold. He went to sleep at once and did not awaken until the fire died
  out. Then he rebuilt it and went to sleep again. Every half-hour all night
  long he repeated this, and was glad indeed when the dawn broke.</p>

  <p>The day began with misfortune. His horse was gone; it had been stolen, or
  had worked out of sight, or had broken the hobbles and made off. From a high
  stone ridge Shefford searched the grassy flats and slopes, all to no purpose.
  Then he tried to track the horse, but this was equally futile. He had
  expected disasters, and the first one did not daunt him. He tied most of his
  pack in the blanket, threw the canteen across his shoulder, and set forth,
  sure at least of one thing&mdash;that he was a very much better traveler on
  foot than on horseback.</p>

  <p>Walking did not afford him the leisure to study the surrounding country;
  however, from time to time, when he surmounted a bench he scanned the
  different landmarks that had grown familiar. It took hours of steady walking
  to reach and pass the yellow peak that had been a kind of goal. He saw many
  sheep trails and horse tracks in the vicinity of this mountain, and once he
  was sure he espied an Indian watching him from a bold ridge-top.</p>

  <p>The day was bright and warm, with air so clear it magnified objects he
  knew to be far away. The ascent was gradual; there were many narrow flats
  connected by steps; and the grass grew thicker and longer. At noon Shefford
  halted under the first cedar-tree, a lonely, dwarfed shrub that seemed to
  have had a hard life. From this point the rise of ground was more
  perceptible, and straggling cedars led the eye on to a purple slope that
  merged into green of pinyon and pine. Could that purple be the sage Venters
  had so feelingly described, or was it merely the purple of deceiving
  distance? Whatever it might be, it gave Shefford a thrill and made him think
  of the strange, shy, and lovely woman Venters had won out here in this
  purple-sage country.</p>

  <p>He calculated that he had ridden thirty miles the day before and had
  already traveled ten miles today, and therefore could hope to be in the pass
  before night. Shefford resumed his journey with too much energy and
  enthusiasm to think of being tired. And he discovered presently that the
  straggling cedars and the slope beyond were much closer than he had judged
  them to be. He reached the sage to find it gray instead of purple. Yet it was
  always purple a little way ahead, and if he half shut his eyes it was purple
  near at hand. He was surprised to find that he could not breathe freely, or
  it seemed so, and soon made the discovery that the sweet, pungent,
  penetrating fragrance of sage and cedar had this strange effect upon him.
  This was an exceedingly dry and odorous forest, where every open space
  between the clumps of cedars was choked with luxuriant sage. The pinyons were
  higher up on the mesa, and the pines still higher. Shefford appeared to lose
  himself. There were no trails; the black mesa on the right and the wall of
  stone on the left could not be seen; but he pushed on with what was either
  singular confidence or rash impulse. And he did not know whether that slope
  was long or short. Once at the summit he saw with surprise that it broke
  abruptly and the descent was very steep and short on that side. Through the
  trees he once more saw the black mesa, rising to the dignity of a mountain;
  and he had glimpses of another flat, narrow valley, this time with a red wall
  running parallel with the mesa. He could not help but hurry down to get an
  unobstructed view. His eagerness was rewarded by a splendid scene, yet to his
  regret he could not force himself to believe it had any relation to the
  pictured scenes in his mind. The valley was half a mile wide, perhaps several
  miles long, and it extended in a curve between the cedar- sloped mesa and a
  looming wall of red stone. There was not a bird or a beast in sight. He found
  a well-defined trail, but it had not been recently used. He passed a low
  structure made of peeled logs and mud, with a dark opening like a door. It
  did not take him many minutes to learn that the valley was longer than he had
  calculated. He walked swiftly and steadily, in spite of the fact that the
  pack had become burdensome. What lay beyond the jutting corner of the mesa
  had increasing fascination for him and acted as a spur. At last he turned the
  corner, only to be disappointed at sight of another cedar slope. He had a
  glimpse of a single black shaft of rock rising far in the distance, and it
  disappeared as his striding forward made the crest of the slope rise toward
  the sky.</p>

  <p>Again his view became restricted, and he lost the sense of a slow and
  gradual uplift of rock and an increase in the scale of proportion. Half-way
  up this ascent he was compelled to rest; and again the sun was slanting low
  when he entered the cedar forest. Soon he was descending, and he suddenly
  came into the open to face a scene that made his heart beat thick and
  fast.</p>

  <p>He saw lofty crags and cathedral spires, and a wonderful canyon winding
  between huge beetling red walk. He heard the murmur of flowing water. The
  trail led down to the canyon floor, which appeared to be level and green and
  cut by deep washes in red earth. Could this canyon be the mouth of Deception
  Pass? It bore no resemblance to any place Shefford had heard described, yet
  somehow he felt rather than saw that it was the portal to the wild fastness
  he had traveled so far to enter.</p>

  <p>Not till he had descended the trail and had dropped his pack did he
  realize how weary and footsore he was. Then he rested. But his eyes roved to
  and fro, and his mind was active. What a wild and lonesome spot! The low
  murmur of shallow water came up to him from a deep, narrow cleft. Shadows
  were already making the canyon seem full of blue haze. He saw a bare slope of
  stone out of which cedar-trees were growing. And as he looked about him he
  became aware of a singular and very perceptible change in the lights and
  shades. The sun was setting; the crags were gold-tipped; the shadows crept
  upward; the sky seemed to darken swiftly; then the gold changed to red,
  slowly dulled, and the grays and purples stood out. Shefford was entranced
  with the beautiful changing effects, and watched till the walls turned black
  and the sky grew steely and a faint star peeped out. Then he set about the
  necessary camp tasks.</p>

  <p>Dead cedars right at hand assured him a comfortable night with steady
  fire; and when he had satisfied his hunger he arranged an easy seat before
  the blazing logs, and gave his mind over to thought of his weird, lonely
  environment.</p>

  <p>The murmur of running water mingled in harmonious accompaniment with the
  moan of the wind in the cedars&mdash;wild, sweet sounds that were balm to his
  wounded spirit! They seemed a part of the silence, rather than a break in it
  or a hindrance to the feeling of it. But suddenly that silence did break to
  the rattle of a rock. Shefford listened, thinking some wild animal was
  prowling around. He felt no alarm. Presently he heard the sound again, and
  again. Then he recognized the crack of unshod hoofs upon rock. A horse was
  coming down the trail. Shefford rather resented the interruption, though he
  still had no alarm. He believed he was perfectly safe. As a matter of fact,
  he had never in his life been anything but safe and padded around with wool,
  hence, never having experienced peril, he did not know what fear was.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw a horse and rider come into dark prominence on the ridge
  just above his camp. They were silhouetted against the starry sky. The
  horseman stopped and he and his steed made a magnificent black statue,
  somehow wild and strange, in Shefford's sight. Then he came on, vanished in
  the darkness under the ridge, presently to emerge into the circle of
  camp-fire light.</p>

  <p>He rode to within twenty feet of Shefford and the fire. The horse was
  dark, wild-looking, and seemed ready to run. The rider appeared to be an
  Indian, and yet had something about him suggesting the cowboy. At once
  Shefford remembered what Presbrey had said about half-breeds. A little shock,
  inexplicable to Shefford, rippled over him.</p>

  <p>He greeted his visitor, but received no answer. Shefford saw a dark, squat
  figure bending forward in the saddle. The man was tense. All about him was
  dark except the glint of a rifle across the saddle. The face under the
  sombrero was only a shadow. Shefford kicked the fire-logs and a brighter
  blaze lightened the scene. Then he saw this stranger a little more clearly,
  and made out an unusually large head, broad dark face, a sinister tight-shut
  mouth, and gleaming black eyes.</p>

  <p>Those eyes were unmistakably hostile. They roved searchingly over
  Shefford's pack and then over his person. Shefford felt for the gun that
  Presbrey had given him. But it was gone. He had left it back where he had
  lost his horse, and had not thought of it since. Then a strange, slow-coming
  cold agitation possessed Shefford. Something gripped his throat.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Shefford was stricken at a menacing movement on the part of the
  horseman. He had drawn a gun. Shefford saw it shine darkly in the firelight.
  The Indian meant to murder him. Shefford saw the grim, dark face in a kind of
  horrible amaze. He felt the meaning of that drawn weapon as he had never felt
  anything before in his life. And he collapsed back into his seat with an icy,
  sickening terror. In a second he was dripping wet with cold sweat. Lightning-
  swift thoughts flashed through his mind. It had been one of his platitudes
  that he was not afraid of death. Yet here he was a shaking, helpless coward.
  What had he learned about either life or death? Would this dark savage plunge
  him into the unknown? It was then that Shefford realized his hollow
  philosophy and the bitter-sweetness of life. He had a brain and a soul, and
  between them he might have worked out his salvation. But what were they to
  this ruthless night- wanderer, this raw and horrible wildness of the
  desert?</p>

  <p>Incapable of voluntary movement, with tongue cleaving to the roof of his
  mouth, Shefford watched the horseman and the half-poised gun. It was not yet
  leveled. Then it dawned upon Shefford that the stranger's head was turned a
  little, his ear to the wind. He was listening. His horse was listening.
  Suddenly he straightened up, wheeled his horse, and trotted away into the
  darkness. But he did not climb the ridge down which he had come.</p>

  <p>Shefford heard the click of hoofs upon the stony trail. Other horses and
  riders were descending into the canyon. They had been the cause of his
  deliverance, and in the relaxation of feeling he almost fainted. Then he sat
  there, slowly recovering, slowly ceasing to tremble, divining that this
  situation was somehow to change his attitude toward life.</p>

  <p>Three horses, two with riders, moved in dark shapes across the skyline
  above the ridge, disappeared as had Shefford's first visitor, and then rode
  into the light. Shefford saw two Indians&mdash;a man and a woman; then with
  surprise recognized the latter to be the Indian girl he had met at Red Lake.
  He was still more surprised to recognize in the third horse the one he had
  lost at the last camp. Shefford rose, a little shaky on his legs, to thank
  these Indians for a double service. The man slipped from his saddle and his
  moccasined feet thudded lightly. He was tall, lithe, erect, a singularly
  graceful figure, and as he advanced Shefford saw a dark face and sharp, dark
  eyes. The Indian was bareheaded, with his hair bound in a band. He resembled
  the girl, but appeared to have a finer face.</p>

  <p>"How do?" he said, in a voice low and distinct. He extended his hand, and
  Shefford felt a grip of steel. He returned the greeting. Then the Indian gave
  Shefford the bridle of the horse, and made signs that appeared to indicate
  the horse had broken his hobbles and strayed. Shefford thanked him. Thereupon
  the Indian unsaddled and led the horses away, evidently to water them. The
  girl remained behind. Shefford addressed her, but she was shy and did not
  respond. He then set about cooking a meal for his visitors, and was busily
  engaged at this when the Indian returned without the horses. Presently
  Shefford resumed his seat by the fire and watched the two eat what he had
  prepared. They certainly were hungry and soon had the pans and cups empty.
  Then the girl drew back a little into the shadow, while the man sat with his
  legs crossed and his feet tucked under him.</p>

  <p>His dark face was smooth, yet it seemed to have lines under the surface.
  Shefford was impressed. He had never seen an Indian who interested him as
  this one. Looked at superficially, he appeared young, wild, silent, locked in
  his primeval apathy, just a healthy savage; but looked at more attentively,
  he appeared matured, even old, a strange, sad, brooding figure, with a burden
  on his shoulders. Shefford found himself growing curious.</p>

  <p>"What place?" asked Shefford, waving his hand toward the dark opening
  between the black cliffs.</p>

  <p>"Sagi," replied the Indian.</p>

  <p>That did not mean anything to Shefford, and he asked if the Sagi was the
  pass, but the Indian shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Wife?" asked Shefford, pointing to the girl.</p>

  <p>The Indian shook his head again. "<i>Bi-la</i>," he said.</p>

  <p>"What you mean?" asked Shefford. "What <i>bi-la</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Sister," replied the Indian. He spoke the word reluctantly, as if the
  white man's language did not please him, but the clearness and correct
  pronunciation surprised Shefford.</p>

  <p>"What name&mdash;what call her?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"Glen Naspa."</p>

  <p>"What your name?" inquired Shefford, indicating the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega," answered the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Navajo?"</p>

  <p>The Indian bowed with what seemed pride and stately dignity.</p>

  <p>"My name John Shefford. Come far way back toward rising sun. Come stay
  here long."</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega's dark eyes were fixed steadily upon Shefford. He reflected
  that he could not remember having felt so penetrating a gaze. But neither the
  Indian's eyes nor face gave any clue to his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Navajo no savvy Jesus Christ," said the Indian, and his voice rolled out
  low and deep.</p>

  <p>Shefford felt both amaze and pain. The Indian had taken him for a
  missionary.</p>

  <p>"No!... Me no missionary," cried Shefford, and he flung up a passionately
  repudiating hand.</p>

  <p>A singular flash shot from the Indian's dark eyes. It struck Shefford even
  at this stinging moment when the past came back.</p>

  <p>"Trade&mdash;buy wool&mdash;blanket?" queried Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Shefford. "Me want ride&mdash;walk far." He waved his hand
  to indicate a wide sweep of territory. "Me sick."</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega laid a significant finger upon his lungs.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Shefford. "Me strong. Sick here." And with motions of his
  hands he tried to show that his was a trouble of the heart.</p>

  <p>Shefford received instant impression of this Indian's intelligent
  comprehension, but he could not tell just what had given him the feeling. Nas
  Ta Bega rose then and walked away into the shadow. Shefford heard him working
  around the dead cedar-tree, where he had probably gone to get fire-wood. Then
  Shefford heard a splintering crash, which was followed by a crunching,
  bumping sound. Presently he was astounded to see the Indian enter the lighted
  circle dragging the whole cedar-tree, trunk first. Shefford would have
  doubted the ability of two men to drag that tree, and here came Nas Ta Bega,
  managing it easily. He laid the trunk on the fire, and then proceeded to
  break off small branches, to place them advantageously where the red coals
  kindled them into a blaze.</p>

  <p>The Indian's next move was to place his saddle, which he evidently meant
  to use for a pillow. Then he spread a goat-skin on the ground, lay down upon
  it, with his back to the fire, and, pulling a long-haired saddle-blanket over
  his shoulders, he relaxed and became motionless. His sister, Glen Naspa, did
  likewise, except that she stayed farther away from the fire, and she had a
  larger blanket, which covered her well. It appeared to Shefford that they
  went to sleep at once.</p>

  <p>Shefford felt as tired as he had ever been, but he did not think he could
  soon drop into slumber, and in fact he did not want to.</p>

  <p>There was something in the companionship of these Indians that he had not
  experienced before. He still had a strange and weak feeling&mdash;the
  aftermath of that fear which had sickened him with its horrible icy grip. Nas
  Ta Bega's arrival had frightened away that dark and silent prowler of the
  night; and Shefford was convinced the Indian had saved his life. The measure
  of his gratitude was a source of wonder to him. Had he cared so much for
  life? Yes&mdash;he had, when face to face with death. That was something to
  know. It helped him. And he gathered from his strange feeling that the
  romantic quest which had brought him into the wilderness might turn out to be
  an antidote for the morbid bitterness of heart.</p>

  <p>With new sensations had come new thoughts. Right then it was very pleasant
  to sit in the warmth and light of the roaring cedar fire. There was a
  deep-seated ache of fatigue in his bones. What joy it was to rest! He had
  felt the dry scorch of desert thirst and the pang of hunger. How wonderful to
  learn the real meaning of water and food! He had just finished the longest,
  hardest day's work of his life! Had that anything to do with a something
  almost like peace which seemed to hover near in the shadows, trying to come
  to him? He had befriended an Indian girl, and now her brother had paid back
  the service. Both the giving and receiving were somehow sweet to Shefford.
  They opened up hitherto vague channels of thought. For years he had imagined
  he was serving people, when he had never lifted a hand. A blow given in the
  defense of an Indian girl had somehow operated to make a change in John
  Shefford's existence. It had liberated a spirit in him. Moreover, it had
  worked its influence outside his mind. The Indian girl and her brother had
  followed his trail to return his horse, perhaps to guide him safely, but,
  unknowingly perhaps, they had done infinitely more than that for him. As
  Shefford's eye wandered over the dark, still figures of the sleepers he had a
  strange, dreamy premonition, or perhaps only a fancy, that there was to be
  more come of this fortunate meeting.</p>

  <p>For the rest, it was good to be there in the speaking silence, to feel the
  heat on his outstretched palms and the cold wind on his cheek, to see the
  black wall lifting its bold outline and the crags reaching for the white
  stars.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III.</a> &mdash; KAYENTA</h2>

  <p class="first">THE stamping of horses awoke Shefford. He A saw a towering
  crag, rosy in the morning light, like a huge red spear splitting the clear
  blue of sky. He got up, feeling cramped and sore, yet with unfamiliar
  exhilaration. The whipping air made him stretch his hands to the fire. An
  odor of coffee and broiled meat mingled with the fragrance of wood smoke.
  Glen Naspa was on her knees broiling a rabbit on a stick over the red coals.
  Nas Ta Bega was saddling the ponies. The canyon appeared to be full of purple
  shadows under one side of dark cliffs and golden streaks of mist on the other
  where the sun struck high up on the walls.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said Shefford.</p>

  <p>Glen Naspa shyly replied in Navajo.</p>

  <p>"How," was Nas Ta Bega's greeting.</p>

  <p>In daylight the Indian lost some of the dark somberness of face that had
  impressed Shefford. He had a noble head, in poise like that of an eagle, a
  bold, clean-cut profile, and stern, close-shut lips. His eyes were the most
  striking and attractive feature about him; they were coal-black and piercing;
  the intent look out of them seemed to come from a keen and inquisitive
  mind.</p>

  <p>Shefford ate breakfast with the Indians, and then helped with the few
  preparations for departure. Before they mounted, Nas Ta Bega pointed to horse
  tracks in the dust. They were those that had been made by Shefford's
  threatening visitor of the night before. Shefford explained by word and sign,
  and succeeded at least in showing that he had been in danger. Nas Ta Bega
  followed the tracks a little way and presently returned.</p>

  <p>"Shadd," he said, with an ominous shake of his head. Shefford did not
  understand whether he meant the name of his visitor or something else, but
  the menace connected with the word was clear enough.</p>

  <p>Glen Naspa mounted her pony, and it was a graceful action that pleased
  Shefford. He climbed a little stiffly into his own saddle. Then Nas Ta Bega
  got up and pointed northward.</p>

  <p>"Kayenta?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Shefford nodded and then they were off, with Glen Naspa in the lead. They
  did not climb the trail which they had descended, but took one leading to the
  right along the base of the slope. Shefford saw down into the red wash that
  bisected the canyon floor. It was a sheer wall of red clay or loam, a hundred
  feet high, and at the bottom ran a swift, shallow stream of reddish water.
  Then for a time a high growth of greasewood hid the surroundings from
  Shefford's sight. Presently the trail led out into the open, and Shefford saw
  that he was at the neck of a wonderful valley that gradually widened with
  great jagged red peaks on the left and the black mesa, now a mountain,
  running away to the right. He turned to find that the opening of the Sagi
  could no longer be seen, and he was conscious of a strong desire to return
  and explore that canyon.</p>

  <p>Soon Glen Naspa put her pony to a long, easy, swinging canter and her
  followers did likewise. As they got outward into the valley Shefford lost the
  sense of being overshadowed and crowded by the nearness of the huge walls and
  crags. The trail appeared level underfoot, but at a distance it was seen to
  climb. Shefford found where it disappeared over the foot of a slope that
  formed a graceful rising line up to the cedared flank of the mesa. The valley
  floor, widening away to the north, remained level and green. Beyond rose the
  jagged range of red peaks, all strangely cut and slanting. These distant
  deceiving features of the country held Shefford's gaze until the Indian drew
  his attention to things near at hand. Then Shefford saw flocks of sheep
  dotting the gray-green valley, and bands of beautiful long-maned, long-tailed
  ponies.</p>

  <p>For several miles the scene did not change except that Shefford imagined
  he came to see where the upland plain ended or at least broke its level. He
  was right, for presently the Indian pointed, and Shefford went on to halt
  upon the edge of a steep slope leading down into a valley vast in its barren
  gray reaches.</p>

  <p>"Kayenta," said Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>Shefford at first saw nothing except the monotonous gray valley reaching
  far to the strange, grotesque monuments of yellow cliff. Then close under the
  foot of the slope he espied two squat stone houses with red roofs, and a
  corral with a pool of water shining in the sun.</p>

  <p>The trail leading down was steep and sandy, but it was not long.
  Shefford's sweeping eyes appeared to take in everything at once&mdash;the
  crude stone structures with their earthen roofs, the piles of dirty wool, the
  Indians lolling around, the tents, and wagons, and horses, little lazy burros
  and dogs, and scattered everywhere saddles, blankets, guns, and packs.</p>

  <p>Then a white man came out of the door. He waved a hand and shouted. Dust
  and wool and flour were thick upon him. He was muscular and weather-beaten,
  and appeared young in activity rather than face. A gun swung at his hip and a
  row of brass-tipped cartridges showed in his belt. Shefford looked into a
  face that he thought he had seen before, until he realized the similarity was
  only the bronze and hard line and rugged cast common to desert men. The gray
  searching eyes went right through him.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you. Get down and come in. Just heard from an Indian that you
  were coming. I'm the trader Withers," he said to Shefford. His voice was
  welcoming and the grip of his hand made Shefford's ache.</p>

  <p>Shefford told his name and said he was as glad as he was lucky to arrive
  at Kayenta.</p>

  <p>"Hello! Nas Ta Bega!" exclaimed Withers. His tone expressed a surprise his
  face did not show. "Did this Indian bring you in?"</p>

  <p>Withers shook hands with the Navajo while Shefford briefly related what he
  owed to him. Then Withers looked at Nas Ta Bega and spoke to him in the
  Indian tongue.</p>

  <p>"Shadd," said Nas Ta Bega. Withers let out a dry little laugh and his
  strong hand tugged at his mustache.</p>

  <p>"Who's Shadd?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"He's a half-breed Ute&mdash;bad Indian, outlaw, murderer. He's in with a
  gang of outlaws who hide in the San Juan country... Reckon you're lucky.
  How'd you come to be there in the Sagi alone?"</p>

  <p>"I traveled from Red Lake. Presbrey, the trader there, advised against it,
  but I came anyway."</p>

  <p>"Well." Withers's gray glance was kind, if it did express the
  foolhardiness of Shefford's act. "Come into the house... Never mind the
  horse. My wife will sure be glad to see you."</p>

  <p>Withers led Shefford by the first stone house, which evidently was the
  trading-store, into the second. The room Shefford entered was large, with
  logs smoldering in a huge open fireplace, blankets covering every foot of
  floor space, and Indian baskets and silver ornaments everywhere, and strange
  Indian designs painted upon the whitewashed walls. Withers called his wife
  and made her acquainted with Shefford. She was a slight, comely little woman,
  with keen, earnest, dark eyes. She seemed to be serious and quiet, but she
  made Shefford feel at home immediately. He refused, however, to accept the
  room offered him, saying that he me meant to sleep out under the open sky.
  Withers laughed at this and said he understood. Shefford, remembering
  Presbrey's hunger for news of the outside world, told this trader and his
  wife all he could think of; and he was listened to with that close attention
  a traveler always gained in the remote places.</p>

  <p>"Sure am glad you rode in," said Withers, for the fourth time. "Now you
  make yourself at home. Stay here&mdash;come over to the store&mdash;do what
  you like. I've got to work. To-night we'll talk."</p>

  <p>Shefford went out with his host. The store was as interesting as
  Presbrey's, though much smaller and more primitive. It was full of
  everything, and smelled strongly of sheep and goats. There was a narrow aisle
  between sacks of flour and blankets on one side and a high counter on the
  other. Behind this counter Withers stood to wait upon the buying Indians.
  They sold blankets and skins and bags of wool, and in exchange took silver
  money. Then they lingered and with slow, staid reluctance bought one thing
  and then another&mdash;flour, sugar, canned goods, coffee, tobacco,
  ammunition. The counter was never without two or three Indians leaning on
  their dark, silver-braceleted arms. But as they were slow to sell and buy and
  go, so were others slow to come in. Their voices were soft and low and it
  seemed to Shefford they were whispering. He liked to hear them and to look at
  the banded heads, the long, twisted rolls of black hair tied with white
  cords, the still dark faces and watchful eyes, the silver ear-rings, the
  slender, shapely brown hands, the lean and sinewy shapes, the corduroys with
  a belt and gun, and the small, close-fitting buckskin moccasins buttoned with
  coins. These Indians all appeared young, and under the quiet, slow demeanor
  there was fierce blood and fire.</p>

  <p>By and by two women came in, evidently squaw and daughter. The former was
  a huge, stout Indian with a face that was certainly pleasant if not
  jolly.</p>

  <p>She had the corners of a blanket tied under her chin, and in the folds
  behind on her broad back was a naked Indian baby, round and black of head,
  brown-skinned, with eyes as bright as beads. When the youngster caught sight
  of Shefford he made a startled dive into the sack of the blanket. Manifestly,
  however, curiosity got the better of fear, for presently Shefford caught a
  pair of wondering dark eyes peeping at him.</p>

  <p>"They're good spenders, but slow," said Withers. "The Navajos are careful
  and cautious. That's why they're rich. This squaw, Yan As Pa, has flocks of
  sheep and more mustangs than she knows about."</p>

  <p>"Mustangs. So that's what you call the ponies?" replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Yep. They're mustangs, and mostly wild as jack-rabbits."</p>

  <p>Shefford strolled outside and made the acquaintance of Withers's helper, a
  Mormon named Whisner. He was a stockily built man past maturity, and his sun-
  blistered face and watery eyes told of the open desert. He was engaged in
  weighing sacks of wool brought in by the Indians. Near by stood a framework
  of poles from which an immense bag was suspended. From the top of this bag
  protruded the head and shoulders of an Indian who appeared to be stamping and
  packing wool with his feet. He grinned at the curious Shefford. But Shefford
  was more interested in the Mormon. So far as he knew, Whisner was the first
  man of that creed he had ever met, and he could scarcely hide his eagerness.
  Venters's stories had been of a long-past generation of Mormons, fanatical,
  ruthless, and unchangeable. Shefford did not expect to meet Mormons of this
  kind. But any man of that religion would have interested him. Besides this,
  Whisner seemed to bring him closer to that wild secret canyon he had come
  West to find. Shefford was somewhat amazed and discomfited to have his polite
  and friendly overtures repulsed. Whisner might have been an Indian. He was
  cold, incommunicative, aloof; and there was something about him that made the
  sensitive Shefford feel his presence was resented.</p>

  <p>Presently Shefford strolled on to the corral, which was full of shaggy
  mustangs. They snorted and kicked at him. He had a half-formed wish that he
  would never be called upon to ride one of those wild brutes, and then he
  found himself thinking that he would ride one of them, and after a while any
  of them. Shefford did not understand himself, but he fought his natural
  instinctive reluctance to meet obstacles, peril, suffering.</p>

  <p>He traced the white-bordered little stream that made the pool in the
  corral, and when he came to where it oozed out of the sand under the bluff he
  decided that was not the spring which had made Kayenta famous. Presently down
  below the trading-post he saw a trough from which burros were drinking. Here
  he found the spring, a deep well of eddying water walled in by stones, and
  the overflow made a shallow stream meandering away between its borders of
  alkali, like a crust of salt. Shefford tasted the water. It bit, but it was
  good.</p>

  <p>Shefford had no trouble in making friends with the lazy sleepy-eyed
  burros. They let him pull their long ears and rub their noses, but the
  mustangs standing around were unapproachable. They had wild eyes; they raised
  long ears and looked vicious. He let them alone.</p>

  <p>Evidently this trading-post was a great deal busier than Red Lake.
  Shefford counted a dozen Indians lounging outside, and there were others
  riding away. Big wagons told how the bags of wool were transported out of the
  wilds and how supplies were brought in. A wide, hard-packed road led off to
  the east, and another, not so clearly defined, wound away to the north. And
  Indian trails streaked off in all directions.</p>

  <p>Shefford discovered, however, when he had walked off a mile or so across
  the valley to lose sight of the post, that the feeling of wildness and
  loneliness returned to him. It was a wonderful country. It held something for
  him besides the possible rescue of an imprisoned girl from a wild canyon.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT night after supper, when Withers and Shefford sat alone
  before the blazing logs in the huge fireplace, the trader laid his hand on
  Shefford's and said, with directness and force:</p>

  <p>"I've lived my life in the desert. I've met many men and have been a
  friend to most... You're no prospector or trader or missionary?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"You've had trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Have you come in here to hide? Don't be afraid to tell me. I won't give
  you away."</p>

  <p>"I didn't come to hide."</p>

  <p>"Then no one is after you? You've done no wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I wronged myself, but no one else," replied Shefford,
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"I reckoned so. Well, tell me, or keep your secret&mdash;it's all one to
  me."</p>

  <p>Shefford felt a desire to unburden himself. This man was strong,
  persuasive, kindly. He drew Shefford.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome in Kayenta," went on Withers. "Stay as long as you like. I
  take no pay from a white man. If you want work I have it aplenty."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. That is good. I need to work. We'll talk of it later... But
  just yet I can't tell you why I came to Kayenta, what I want to do, how long
  I shall stay. My thoughts put in words would seem so like dreams. Maybe they
  are dreams. Perhaps I'm only chasing a phantom&mdash;perhaps I'm only hunting
  the treasure at the foot of the rainbow."</p>

  <p>"Well, this is the country for rainbows," laughed Withers. "In summer from
  June to August when it storms we have rainbows that'll make you think you're
  in another world. The Navajos have rainbow mountains, rainbow canyons,
  rainbow bridges of stone, rainbow trails. It sure is rainbow country."</p>

  <p>That deep and mystic chord in Shefford thrilled. Here it was again&mdash;
  something tangible at the bottom of his dream.</p>

  <p>Withers did not wait for Shefford to say any more, and almost as if he
  read his visitor's mind he began to talk about the wild country he called
  home.</p>

  <p>He had lived at Kayenta for several years&mdash;hard and profitless years
  by reason of marauding outlaws. He could not have lived there at all but for
  the protection of the Indians. His father-in-law had been friendly with the
  Navajos and Piutes for many years, and his wife had been brought up among
  them. She was held in peculiar reverence and affection by both tribes in that
  part of the country. Probably she knew more of the Indians' habits, religion,
  and life than any white person in the West. Both tribes were friendly and
  peaceable, but there were bad Indians, half-breeds, and outlaws that made the
  trading-post a venture Withers had long considered precarious, and he wanted
  to move and intended to some day. His nearest neighbors in New Mexico and
  Colorado were a hundred miles distant and at some seasons the roads were
  impassable. To the north, however, twenty miles or so, was situated a Mormon
  village named Stonebridge. It lay across the Utah line. Withers did some
  business with this village, but scarcely enough to warrant the risks he had
  to run. During the last year he had lost several pack-trains, one of which he
  had never heard of after it left Stonebridge.</p>

  <p>"Stonebridge!" exclaimed Shefford, and he trembled. He had heard that
  name. In his memory it had a place beside the name of another village
  Shefford longed to speak of to this trader.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Stonebridge," replied Withers. "Ever heard the name?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. Are there other villages in&mdash;in that part of the
  country?"</p>

  <p>"A few, but not close. Glaze is now only a water-hole. Bluff and
  Monticello are far north across the San Juan... There used to be another
  village&mdash;but that wouldn't interest you."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it would," replied Shefford, quietly.</p>

  <p>But his hint was not taken by the trader. Withers suddenly showed a
  semblance of the aloofness Shefford had observed in Whisner.</p>

  <p>"Withers, pardon an impertinence&mdash;I am deeply serious... Are you a
  Mormon?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I'm not," replied the trader, instantly.</p>

  <p>"Are you for the Mormons or against them?"</p>

  <p>"Neither. I get along with them. I know them. I believe they are a
  misunderstood people."</p>

  <p>"That's for them."</p>

  <p>"No. I'm only fair-minded."</p>

  <p>Shefford paused, trying to curb his thrilling impulse, but it was too
  strong.</p>

  <p>"You said there used to be another village... Was the name of it&mdash;
  Cottonwoods?"</p>

  <p>Withers gave a start and faced round to stare at Shefford in blank
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Say, did you give me a straight story about yourself?" he queried,
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"So far as I went," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"You're no spy on the lookout for sealed wives?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely not. I don't even know what you mean by sealed wives."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's damn strange that you'd know the name Cottonwoods... Yes,
  that's the name of the village I meant&mdash;the one that used to be. It's
  gone now, all except a few stone walls."</p>

  <p>"What became of it?"</p>

  <p>"Torn down by Mormons years ago. They destroyed it and moved away. I've
  heard Indians talk about a grand spring that was there once. It's gone, too.
  Its name was&mdash;let me see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Amber Spring," interrupted Shefford.</p>

  <p>"By George, you're right!" rejoined the trader, again amazed. "Shefford,
  this beats me. I haven't heard that name for ten years. I can't help seeing
  what a tenderfoot&mdash;stranger&mdash;you are to the desert. Yet, here you
  are&mdash;speaking of what you should know nothing of... And there's more
  behind this."</p>

  <p>Shefford rose, unable to conceal his agitation.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of a rider named Venters?"</p>

  <p>"Rider? You mean a cowboy? Venters. No, I never heard that name."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of a gunman named Lassiter?" queried Shefford, with
  increasing emotion.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of a Mormon woman named&mdash;Jane Withersteen?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Shefford drew his breath sharply. He had followed a gleam&mdash;he had
  caught a fleeting glimpse of it.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of a child&mdash;a girl&mdash;a woman&mdash; called Fay
  Larkin?"</p>

  <p>Withers rose slowly with a paling face.</p>

  <p>"If you're a spy it'll go hard with you&mdash;though I'm no Mormon," he
  said, grimly.</p>

  <p>Shefford lifted a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>"I WAS a clergyman. Now I'm nothing&mdash;a wanderer&mdash;least of all a
  spy."</p>

  <p>Withers leaned closer to see into the other man's eyes; he looked long and
  then appeared satisfied.</p>

  <p>"I've heard the name Fay Larkin," he said, slowly. "I reckon that's all
  I'll say till you tell your story."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD stood with his back to the fire and he turned the
  palms of his hands to catch the warmth. He felt cold. Withers had affected
  him strangely. What was the meaning of the trader's somber gravity? Why was
  the very mention of Mormons attended by something austere and secret?</p>

  <p>"My name is John Shefford. I am twenty-four," began Shefford. "My family
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here a knock on the door interrupted Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Come in," called Withers.</p>

  <p>The door opened and like a shadow Nas Ta Bega slipped in. He said
  something in Navajo to the trader.</p>

  <p>"How," he said to Shefford, and extended his hand. He was stately, but
  there was no mistaking his friendliness. Then he sat down before the fire,
  doubled his legs under him after the Indian fashion, and with dark eyes on
  the blazing logs seemed to lose himself in meditation.</p>

  <p>"He likes the fire," explained Withers. "Whenever he comes to Kayenta he
  always visits me like this... Don't mind him. Go on with your story."</p>

  <p>"My family were plain people, well-to-do, and very religious," went on
  Shefford. "When I was a boy we moved from the country to a town called
  Beaumont, Illinois. There was a college in Beaumont and eventually I was sent
  to it to study for the ministry. I wanted to be&mdash;But never mind that ...
  By the time I was twenty-two I was ready for my career as a clergyman. I
  preached for a year around at different places and then got a church in my
  home town of Beaumont. I became exceedingly good friends with a man named
  Venters, who had recently come to Beaumont. He was a singular man. His wife
  was a strange, beautiful woman, very reserved, and she had wonderful dark
  eyes. They had money and were devoted to each other, and perfectly happy.
  They owned the finest horses ever seen in Illinois, and their particular
  enjoyment seemed to be riding. They were always taking long rides. It was
  something worth going far for to see Mrs. Venters on a horse.</p>

  <p>"It was through my own love of horses that I became friendly with Venters.
  He and his wife attended my church, and as I got to see more of them,
  gradually we grew intimate. And it was not until I did get intimate with them
  that I realized that both seemed to be haunted by the past. They were
  sometimes sad even in their happiness. They drifted off into dreams. They
  lived back in another world. They seemed to be listening. Indeed, they were a
  singularly interesting couple, and I grew genuinely fond of them. By and by
  they had a little girl whom they named Jane. The coming of the baby made a
  change in my friends. They were happier, and I observed that the haunting
  shadow did not so often return.</p>

  <p>"Venters had spoken of a journey west that he and his wife meant to take
  some time. But after the baby came he never mentioned his wife in connection
  with the trip. I gathered that he felt compelled to go to clear up a mystery
  or to find something&mdash;I did not make out just what. But eventually, and
  it was about a year ago, he told me his story&mdash;the strangest, wildest,
  and most tragic I ever heard. I can't tell it all now. It is enough to say
  that fifteen years before he had been a rider for a rich Mormon woman named
  Jane Withersteen, of this village Cottonwoods. She had adopted a beautiful
  Gentile child named Fay Larkin. Her interest in Gentiles earned the
  displeasure of her churchmen, and as she was proud there came a breach.
  Venters and a gunman named Lassiter became involved in her quarrel. Finally
  Venters took to the canyon. Here in the wilds he found the strange girl he
  eventually married. For a long time they lived in a wonderful hidden valley,
  the entrance to which was guarded by a huge balancing rock. Venters got away
  with the girl. But Lassiter and Jane Withersteen and the child Fay Larkin
  were driven into the canyon. They escaped to the valley where Venters had
  lived. Lassiter rolled the balancing rock, and, crashing down the narrow
  trail, it loosened the weathered walls and closed the narrow outlet for
  ever."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV.</a> &mdash; NEW FRIENDS</h2>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD ended his narrative out of breath, pale, and
  dripping with sweat. Withers sat leaning forward with an expression of
  intense interest. Nas Ta Bega's easy, graceful pose had succeeded to one of
  strained rigidity. He seemed a statue of bronze. Could a few intelligible
  words, Shefford wondered, have created that strange, listening posture?</p>

  <p>"Venters got out of Utah, of course, as you know," went on Shefford. "He
  got out, knowing&mdash;as I feel I would have known&mdash;that Jane,
  Lassiter, and little Fay Larkin were shut up, walled up in Surprise Valley.
  For years Venters considered it would not have been safe for him to venture
  to rescue them. He had no fears for their lives. They could live in Surprise
  Valley. But Venters always intended to come back with Bess and find the
  valley and his friends. No wonder he and Bess were haunted. However, when his
  wife had the baby that made a difference. It meant he had to go alone. And he
  was thinking seriously of starting when&mdash;when there were developments
  that made it desirable for me to leave Beaumont. Venters's story haunted me
  as he had been haunted. I dreamed of that wild valley&mdash;of little Fay
  Larkin grown to womanhood&mdash;such a woman as Bess Venters was. And the
  longing to come was great... And, Withers&mdash;here I am."</p>

  <p>The trader reached out and gave Shefford the grip of a man in whom emotion
  was powerful, but deep and difficult to express.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this... I wish I could help you. Life is a queer deal...
  Shefford, I've got to trust you. Over here in the wild canyon country there's
  a village of Mormons' sealed wives. It's in Arizona, perhaps twenty miles
  from here, and near the Utah line. When the United States government began to
  persecute, or prosecute, the Mormons for polygamy, the Mormons over here in
  Stonebridge took their sealed wives and moved them out of Utah, just across
  the line. They built houses, established a village there. I'm the only
  Gentile who knows about it. And I pack supplies every few weeks in to these
  women. There are perhaps fifty women, mostly young&mdash;second or third or
  fourth wives of Mormons&mdash;sealed wives. And I want you to understand that
  sealed means SEALED in all that religion or loyalty can get out of the word.
  There are also some old women and old men in the village, but they hardly
  count. And there's a flock of the finest children you ever saw in your
  life.</p>

  <p>"The idea of the Mormons must have been to escape prosecution. The law of
  the government is one wife for each man&mdash;no more. All over Utah
  polygamists have been arrested. The Mormons are deeply concerned. I believe
  they are a good, law-abiding people. But this law is a direct blow at their
  religion. In my opinion they can't obey both. And therefore they have not
  altogether given up plural wives. Perhaps they will some day. I have no
  proof, but I believe the Mormons of Stonebridge pay secret night visits to
  their sealed wives across the line in the lonely, hidden village.</p>

  <p>"Now once over in Stonebridge I overheard some Mormons talking about a
  girl who was named Fay Larkin. I never forgot the name. Later I heard the
  name in this sealed-wife village. But, as I told you, I never heard of
  Lassiter or Jane Withersteen. Still, if Mormons had found them I would never
  have heard of it. And Deception Pass&mdash;that might be the Sagi... I'm not
  surprised at your rainbow-chasing adventure. It's a great story... This Fay
  Larkin I've heard of MIGHT be your Fay Larkin&mdash;I almost believe so.
  Shefford, I'll help you find out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I must know," replied Shefford. "Oh, I hope, I pray we can
  find her! But&mdash;I'd rather she was dead&mdash;if she's not still hidden
  in the valley."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. You've dreamed yourself into rescuing this lost Fay Larkin...
  But, Shefford, you're old enough to know life doesn't work out as you want it
  to. One way or another I fear you're in for a bitter disappointment."</p>

  <p>"Withers, take me to the village."</p>

  <p>"Shefford, you're liable to get in bad out here," said the trader,
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't be any more ruined than I am now," replied Shefford,
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"But there's risk in this&mdash;risk such as you never had," persisted
  Withers.</p>

  <p>"I'll risk anything."</p>

  <p>"Reckon this is a funny deal for a sheep-trader to have on his hands,"
  continued Withers. "Shefford, I like you. I've a mind to see you through
  this. It's a damn strange story... I'll tell you what&mdash;I will help you.
  I'll give you a job packing supplies in to the village. I meant to turn that
  over to a Mormon cowboy&mdash;Joe Lake. The job shall be yours, and I'll go
  with you first trip. Here's my hand on it... Now, Shefford, I'm more curious
  about you than I was before you told your story. What ruined you? As we're to
  be partners, you can tell me now. I'll keep your secret. Maybe I can do you
  good."</p>

  <p>Shefford wanted to confess, yet it was hard. Perhaps, had he not been so
  agitated, he would not have answered to impulse. But this trader was a man
  &mdash;a man of the desert&mdash;he would understand.</p>

  <p>"I told you I was a clergyman," said Shefford in low voice. "I didn't want
  to be one, but they made me one. I did my best. I failed... I had doubts of
  religion&mdash;of the Bible&mdash;of God, as my Church believed in them. As I
  grew older thought and study convinced me of the narrowness of religion as my
  congregation lived it. I preached what I believed. I alienated them. They put
  me out, took my calling from me, disgraced me, ruined me."</p>

  <p>"So that's all!" exclaimed Withers, slowly. "You didn't believe in the God
  of the Bible... Well, I've been in the desert long enough to know there IS a
  God, but probably not the one your Church worships... Shefford, go to the
  Navajo for a faith!"</p>

  <p>Shefford had forgotten the presence of Nas Ta Bega, and perhaps Withers
  had likewise. At this juncture the Indian rose to his full height, and he
  folded his arms to stand with the somber pride of a chieftain while his dark,
  inscrutable eyes were riveted upon Shefford. At that moment he seemed
  magnificent. How infinitely more he seemed than just a common Indian who had
  chanced to befriend a white man! The difference was obscure to Shefford. But
  he felt that it was there in the Navajo's mind. Nas Ta Bega's strange look
  was not to be interpreted. Presently he turned and passed from the room.</p>

  <p>"By George!" cried Withers, suddenly, and he pounded his knee with his
  fist. "I'd forgotten."</p>

  <p>"What?" ejaculated Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Why, that Indian understood every word we said. He knows English. He's
  educated. Well, if this doesn't beat me... Let me tell you about Nas Ta
  Bega."</p>

  <p>Withers appeared to be recalling something half forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Years ago, in fifty-seven, I think, Kit Carson with his soldiers chased
  the Navajo tribes and rounded them up to be put on reservations. But he
  failed to catch all the members of one tribe. They escaped up into wild
  canyon like the Sagi. The descendants of these fugitives live there now and
  are the finest Indians on earth&mdash;the finest because unspoiled by the
  white man. Well, as I got the story, years after Carson's round-up one of his
  soldiers guided some interested travelers in here. When they left they took
  an Indian boy with them to educate. From what I know of Navajos I'm inclined
  to think the boy was taken against his parents' wish. Anyway, he was taken.
  That boy was Nas Ta Bega. The story goes that he was educated somewhere.
  Years afterward, and perhaps not long before I came in here, he returned to
  his people. There have been missionaries and other interested fools who have
  given Indians a white man's education. In all the instances I know of, these
  educated Indians returned to their tribes, repudiating the white man's
  knowledge, habits, life, and religion. I have heard that Nas Ta Bega came
  back, laid down the white man's clothes along with the education, and never
  again showed that he had known either.</p>

  <p>"You have just seen how strangely he acted. It's almost certain he heard
  our conversation. Well, it doesn't matter. He won't tell. He can hardly be
  made to use an English word. Besides, he's a noble red man, if there ever was
  one. He has been a friend in need to me. If you stay long out here you'll
  learn something from the Indians. Nas Ta Bega has befriended you, too, it
  seems. I thought he showed unusual interest in you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that was because I saved his sister&mdash;well, to be charitable,
  from the rather rude advances of a white man," said Shefford, and he
  proceeded to tell of the incident that occurred at Red Lake.</p>

  <p>"Willetts!" exclaimed Withers, with much the same expression that Presbrey
  had used. "I never met him. But I know about him. He's&mdash;well, the
  Indians don't like him much. Most of the missionaries are good men&mdash;
  good for the Indians, in a way, but sometimes one drifts out here who is bad.
  A bad missionary teaching religion to savages! Queer, isn't it? The queerest
  part is the white people's blindness&mdash;the blindness of those who send
  the missionaries. Well, I dare say Willetts isn't very good. When Presbrey
  said that was Willetts's way of teaching religion he meant just what he said.
  If Willetts drifts over here he'll be risking much... This you told me
  explains Nas Ta Bega's friendliness toward you, and also his bringing his
  sister Glen Naspa to live with relatives up in the pass. She had been living
  near Red Lake."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean Nas Ta Bega wants to keep his sister far removed from
  Willetts?" inquired Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I mean that," replied Withers, "and I hope he's not too late."</p>

  <p>Later Shefford went outdoors to walk and think. There was no moon, but the
  stars made light enough to cast his shadow on the ground. The dark,
  illimitable expanse of blue sky seemed to be glittering with numberless
  points of fire. The air was cold and still. A dreaming silence lay over the
  land. Shefford saw and felt all these things, and their effect was continuous
  and remained with him and helped calm him. He was conscious of a burden
  removed from his mind. Confession of his secret had been like tearing a thorn
  from his flesh, but, once done, it afforded him relief and a singular
  realization that out here it did not matter much. In a crowd of men all
  looking at him and judging him by their standards he had been made to suffer.
  Here, if he were judged at all, it would be by what he could do, how he
  sustained himself and helped others.</p>

  <p>He walked far across the valley toward the low bluffs, but they did not
  seem to get any closer. And, finally, he stopped beside a stone and looked
  around at the strange horizon and up at the heavens. He did not feel utterly
  aloof from them, nor alone in a waste, nor a useless atom amid
  incomprehensible forces. Something like a loosened mantle fell from about
  him, dropping down at his feet; and all at once he was conscious of freedom.
  He did not understand in the least why abasement left him, but it was so. He
  had come a long way, in bitterness, in despair, believing himself to be what
  men had called him. The desert and the stars and the wind, the silence of the
  night, the loneliness of this vast country where there was room for a
  thousand cities&mdash;these somehow vaguely, yet surely, bade him lift his
  head. They withheld their secret, but they made a promise. The thing which he
  had been feeling every day and every night was a strange enveloping comfort.
  And it was at this moment that Shefford, divining whence his help was to
  come, embraced all that wild and speaking nature around and above him and
  surrendered himself utterly.</p>

  <p>"I am young. I am free. I have my life to live," he said. "I'll be a man.
  I'll take what comes. Let me learn here!"</p>

  <p>When he had spoken out, settled once and for ever his attitude toward his
  future, he seemed to be born again, wonderfully alive to the influences
  around him, ready to trust what yet remained a mystery.</p>

  <p>Then his thoughts reverted to Fay Larkin. Could this girl be known to the
  Mormons? It was possible. Fay Larkin was an unusual name. Deep into
  Shefford's heart had sunk the story Venters had told. Shefford found that he
  had unconsciously created a like romance&mdash;he had been loving a wild and
  strange and lonely girl, like beautiful Bess Venters. It was a shock to learn
  the truth, but, as it had been only a dream, it could hardly be vital.</p>

  <p>Shefford retraced his steps toward the post. Halfway back he espied a
  tall, dark figure moving toward him, and presently the shape and the step
  seemed familiar. Then he recognized Nas Ta Bega. Soon they were face to face.
  Shefford felt that the Indian had been trailing him over the sand, and that
  this was to be a significant meeting. Remembering Withers's revelation about
  the Navajo, Shefford scarcely knew how to approach him now. There was no
  difference to be made out in Nas Ta Bega's dark face and inscrutable eyes,
  yet there was a difference to be felt in his presence. But the Indian did not
  speak, and turned to walk by Shefford's side. Shefford could not long be
  silent.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, were you looking for me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You had no gun," replied the Indian.</p>

  <p>But for his very low voice, his slow speaking of the words, Shefford would
  have thought him a white man. For Shefford there was indeed an instinct in
  this meeting, and he turned to face the Navajo.</p>

  <p>"Withers told me you had been educated, that you came back to the desert,
  that you never showed your training... Nas Ta Bega, did you understand all I
  told Withers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the Indian.</p>

  <p>"You won't betray me?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Navajo."</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, you trail me&mdash;you say I had no gun." Shefford wanted to
  ask this Indian if he cared to be the white man's friend, but the question
  was not easy to put, and, besides, seemed unnecessary. "I am alone and
  strange in this wild country. I must learn."</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega will show you the trails and the water-holes and how to hide
  from Shadd."</p>

  <p>"For money&mdash;for silver you will do this?" inquired Shefford.</p>

  <p>Shefford felt that the Indian's silence was a rebuke. He remembered
  Withers's singular praise of this red man. He realized he must change his
  idea of Indians.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, I know nothing. I feel like a child in the wilderness. When
  I speak it is out of the mouths of those who have taught me. I must find a
  new voice and a new life... You heard my story to Withers. I am an outcast
  from my own people. If you will be my friend&mdash;be so."</p>

  <p>The Indian clasped Shefford's hand and held it in a response that was more
  beautiful for its silence. So they stood for a moment in the starlight.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, what did Withers mean when he said go to the Navajo for a
  faith?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"He meant the desert is my mother... Will you go with Nas Ta Bega into the
  canyon and the mountains?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I will."</p>

  <p>They unclasped hands and turned toward the trading-post.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, have you spoken my tongue to any other white man since you
  returned to your home?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why do you&mdash;why are you different for me?"</p>

  <p>The Indian maintained silence.</p>

  <p>"Is it because of&mdash;of Glen Naspa?" inquired Shefford.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega stalked on, still silent, but Shefford divined that, although
  his service to Glen Naspa would never be forgotten, still it was not wholly
  responsible for the Indian's subtle sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai! The Navajo will call his white friend Bi Nai&mdash;brother," said
  Nas Ta Bega, and he spoke haltingly, not as if words were hard to find, but
  strange to speak. "I was stolen from my mother's hogan and taken to
  California. They kept me ten years in a mission at San Bernardino and four
  years in a school. They said my color and my hair were all that was left of
  the Indian in me. But they could not see my heart. They took fourteen years
  of my life. They wanted to make me a missionary among my own people. But the
  white man's ways and his life and his God are not the Indian's. They never
  can be."</p>

  <p>How strangely productive of thought for Shefford to hear the Indian talk!
  What fatality in this meeting and friendship! Upon Nas Ta Bega had been
  forced education, training, religion, that had made him something more and
  something less than an Indian. It was something assimilated from the white
  man which made the Indian unhappy and alien in his own home&mdash;something
  meant to be good for him and his kind that had ruined him. For Shefford felt
  the passion and the tragedy of this Navajo.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, the Indian is dying!" Nas Ta Bega's low voice was deep and
  wonderful with its intensity of feeling. "The white man robbed the Indian of
  lands and homes, drove him into the deserts, made him a gaunt and sleepless
  spiller of blood... The blood is all spilled now, for the Indian is broken.
  But the white man sells him rum and seduces his daughters... He will not
  leave the Indian in peace with his own God!... Bi Nai, the Indian is
  dying!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT night Shefford lay in his blankets out under the open
  sky and the stars. The earth had never meant much to him, and now it was a
  bed. He had preached of the heavens, but until now had never studied them. An
  Indian slept beside him. And not until the gray of morning had blotted out
  the starlight did Shefford close his eyes.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">WITH break of the next day came full, varied, and stirring
  incidents to Shefford. He was strong, though unskilled at most kinds of
  outdoor tasks. Withers had work for ten men, if they could have been found.
  Shefford dug and packed and lifted till he was so sore and tired that rest
  was a blessing.</p>

  <p>He never succeeded in getting on a friendly footing with the Mormon
  Whisner, though he kept up his agreeable and kindly advances. He listened to
  the trader's wife as she told him about the Indians, and what he learned he
  did not forget. And his wonder and respect increased in proportion to his
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>One day there rode into Kayenta the Mormon for whom Withers had been
  waiting. His name was Joe Lake. He appeared young, and slipped off his superb
  bay with a grace and activity that were astounding in one of his huge bulk.
  He had a still, smooth face, with the color of red bronze and the expression
  of a cherub; big, soft, dark eyes; and a winning smile. He was surprisingly
  different from Whisner or any Mormon character that Shefford had naturally
  conceived. His costume was that of the cowboy on active service; and he
  packed a gun at his hip. The hand-shake he gave Shefford was an ordeal for
  that young man and left him with his whole right side momentarily
  benumbed.</p>

  <p>"I sure am glad to meet you," he said in a lazy, mild voice. And he was
  taking friendly stock of Shefford when the bay mustang reached with vicious
  muzzle to bite at him. Lake gave a jerk on the bridle that almost brought the
  mustang to his knees. He reared then, snorted, and came down to plant his
  forefeet wide apart, and watched his master with defiant eyes. This mustang
  was the finest horse Shefford had ever seen. He appeared quite large for his
  species, was almost red in color, had a racy and powerful build, and a fine
  thoroughbred head with dark, fiery eyes. He did not look mean, but he had
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"Navvy, you've sure got bad manners," said Lake, shaking the mustang's
  bridle. He spoke as if he were chiding a refractory little boy. "Didn't I
  break you better'n that? What's this gentleman goin' to think of you? Tryin'
  to bite my ear off!"</p>

  <p>Lake had arrived about the middle of the forenoon, and Withers announced
  his intention of packing at once for the trip. Indians were sent out on the
  ranges to drive in burros and mustangs. Shefford had his thrilling expectancy
  somewhat chilled by what he considered must have been Lake's reception of the
  trader's plan. Lake seemed to oppose him, and evidently it took vehemence and
  argument on Withers's part to make the Mormon tractable. But Withers won him
  over, and then he called Shefford to his side.</p>

  <p>"You fellows got to be good friends," he said. "You'll have charge of my
  pack-trains. Nas Ta Bega wants to go with you. I'll feel safer about my
  supplies and stock than I've ever been... Joe, I'll back this stranger for
  all I'm worth. He's square... And, Shefford, Joe Lake is a Mormon of the
  younger generation. I want to start you right. You can trust him as you trust
  me. He's white clean through. And he's the best horse-wrangler in Utah."</p>

  <p>It was Lake who first offered his hand, and Shefford made haste to meet it
  with his own. Neither of them spoke. Shefford intuitively felt an alteration
  in Lake's regard, or at least a singular increase of interest. Lake had been
  told that Shefford had been a clergyman, was now a wanderer, without any
  religion. Again it seemed to Shefford that he owed a forming of friendship to
  this singular fact. And it hurt him. But strangely it came to him that he had
  taken a liking to a Mormon.</p>

  <p>About one o'clock the pack-train left Kayenta. Nas Ta Bega led the way up
  the slope. Following him climbed half a dozen patient, plodding, heavily
  laden burros. Withers came next, and he turned in his saddle to wave good-by
  to his wife. Joe Lake appeared to be busy keeping a red mule and a wild gray
  mustang and a couple of restive blacks in the trail. Shefford brought up in
  the rear.</p>

  <p>His mount was a beautiful black mustang with three white feet, a white
  spot on his nose, and a mane that swept to his knees. "His name's Nack-yal,"
  Withers had said. "It means two bits, or twenty-five cents. He ain't worth
  more." To look at Nack-yal had pleased Shefford very much indeed, but, once
  upon his back, he grew dubious. The mustang acted queer. He actually looked
  back at Shefford, and it was a look of speculation and disdain. Shefford took
  exception to Nack-yal's manner and to his reluctance to go, and especially to
  a habit the mustang had of turning off the trail to the left. Shefford had
  managed some rather spirited horses back in Illinois; and though he was
  willing and eager to learn all over again, he did not enjoy the prospect of
  Lake and Withers seeing this black mustang make a novice of him. And he
  guessed that was just what Nack-yal intended to do. However, once up over the
  hill, with Kayenta out of sight, Nack-yal trotted along fairly well, needing
  only now and then to be pulled back from his strange swinging to the left off
  the trail.</p>

  <p>The pack-train traveled steadily and soon crossed the upland plain to
  descend into the valley again. Shefford saw the jagged red peaks with an
  emotion he could not name. The canyon between them were purple in the
  shadows, the great walls and slopes brightened to red, and the tips were gold
  in the sun. Shefford forgot all about his mustang and the trail.</p>

  <p>Suddenly with a pound of hoofs Nack-yal seemed to rise. He leaped sidewise
  out of the trail, came down stiff-legged. Then Shefford shot out of the
  saddle. He landed so hard that he was stunned for an instant. Sitting up, he
  saw the mustang bent down, eyes and ears showing fight, and his forefeet
  spread. He appeared to be looking at something in the trail. Shefford got up
  and soon saw what had been the trouble. A long, crooked stick, rather thick
  and black and yellow, lay in the trail, and any mustang looking for an excuse
  to jump might have mistaken it for a rattlesnake. Nack-yal appeared disposed
  to be satisfied, and gave Shefford no trouble in mounting. The incident
  increased Shefford's dubiousness. These Arizona mustangs were unknown
  quantities.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Shefford had an eye for the trail rather than the scenery, and
  this continued till the pack-train entered the mouth of the Sagi. Then those
  wonderful lofty cliffs, with their peaks and towers and spires, loomed so
  close and so beautiful that he did not care if Nack-yal did throw him. Along
  here, however, the mustang behaved well, and presently Shefford decided that
  if it had been otherwise he would have walked. The trail suddenly stood on
  end and led down into the deep wash, where some days before he had seen the
  stream of reddish water. This day there appeared to be less water and it was
  not so red. Nack-yal sank deep as he took short and careful steps down. The
  burros and other mustangs were drinking, and Nack-yal followed suit. The
  Indian, with a hand clutching his mustang's mane, rode up a steep, sandy
  slope on the other side that Shefford would not have believed any horse could
  climb. The burros plodded up and over the rim, with Withers calling to them.
  Joe Lake swung his rope and cracked the flanks of the gray mare and the red
  mule; and the way the two kicked was a revelation and a warning to Shefford.
  When his turn came to climb the trail he got off and walked, an action that
  Nack-yal appeared fully to appreciate.</p>

  <p>From the head of this wash the trail wound away up the widening canyon,
  through greasewood flats and over greasy levels and across sandy stretches.
  The looming walls made the valley look narrow, yet it must have been half a
  mile wide. The slopes under the cliffs were dotted with huge stones and
  cedar-trees. There were deep indentations in the walls, running back to form
  box canyon, choked with green of cedar and spruce and pinyon. These notches
  haunted Shefford, and he was ever on the lookout for more of them.</p>

  <p>Withers came back to ride just in advance and began to talk.</p>

  <p>"Reckon this Sagi canyon is your Deception Pass," he said. "It's sure a
  queer hole. I've been lost more than once, hunting mustangs in here. I've an
  idea Nas Ta Bega knows all this country. He just pointed out a cliff-dwelling
  to me. See it?... There 'way up in that cave of the wall."</p>

  <p>Shefford saw a steep, rough slope leading up to a bulge of the cliff, and
  finally he made out strange little houses with dark, eyelike windows. He
  wanted to climb up there. Withers called his attention to more caves with
  what he believed were the ruins of cliff-dwellings. And as they rode along
  the trader showed him remarkable formations of rock where the elements were
  slowly hollowing out a bridge. They came presently to a region of
  intersecting canyon, and here the breaking of the trail up and down the deep
  washes took Withers back to his task with the burros and gave Shefford more
  concern than he liked with Nack-yal. The mustang grew unruly and was
  continually turning to the left. Sometimes he tried to climb the steep slope.
  He had to be pulled hard away from the opening canyon on the left. It seemed
  strange to Shefford that the mustang never swerved to the right. This habit
  of Nack-yal's and the increasing caution needed on the trail took all of
  Shefford's attention. When he dismounted, however, he had a chance to look
  around, and more and more he was amazed at the increasing proportions and
  wildness of the Sagi.</p>

  <p>He came at length to a place where a fallen tree blocked the trail. All of
  the rest of the pack-train had jumped the log. But Nack-yal balked. Shefford
  dismounted, pulled the bridle over the mustang's head, and tried to lead him.
  Nack-yal, however, refused to budge. Whereupon Shefford got a stick and,
  remounting, he gave the balky mustang a cut across the flank. Then something
  violent happened. Shefford received a sudden propelling jolt, and then he was
  rising into the air, and then falling. Before he alighted he had a clear
  image of Nack-yal in the air above him, bent double, and seemingly possessed
  of devils. Then Shefford hit the ground with no light thud. He was thoroughly
  angry when he got dizzily upon his feet, but he was not quick enough to catch
  the mustang. Nack-yal leaped easily over the log and went on ahead, dragging
  his bridle. Shefford hurried after him, and the faster he went just by so
  much the cunning Nack-yal accelerated his gait. As the pack-train was out of
  sight somewhere ahead, Shefford could not call to his companions to halt his
  mount, so he gave up trying, and walked on now with free and growing
  appreciation of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>The afternoon had waned. The sun blazed low in the west in a notch of the
  canyon ramparts, and one wall was darkening into purple shadow while the
  other shone through a golden haze. It was a weird, wild world to Shefford,
  and every few strides he caught his breath and tried to realize actuality was
  not a dream.</p>

  <p>Nack-yal kept about a hundred paces to the fore and ever and anon he
  looked back to see how his new master was progressing. He varied these
  occasions by reaching down and nipping a tuft of grass. Evidently he was too
  intelligent to go on fast enough to be caught by Withers. Also he kept
  continually looking up the slope to the left as if seeking a way to climb out
  of the valley in that direction. Shefford thought it was well the trail lay
  at the foot of a steep slope that ran up to unbroken bluffs.</p>

  <p>The sun set and the canyon lost its red and its gold and deepened its
  purple. Shefford calculated he had walked five miles, and though he did not
  mind the effort, he would rather have ridden Nack-yal into camp. He mounted a
  cedar ridge, crossed some sandy washes, turned a corner of bold wall to enter
  a wide, green level. The mustangs were rolling and snorting. He heard the
  bray of a burro. A bright blaze of camp-fire greeted him, and the dark figure
  of the Indian approached to intercept and catch Nack-yal. When he stalked
  into camp Withers wore a beaming smile, and Joe Lake, who was on his knees
  making biscuit dough in a pan, stopped proceedings and drawled:</p>

  <p>"Reckon Nack-yal bucked you off."</p>

  <p>"Bucked! Was that it? Well, he separated himself from me in a new and
  somewhat painful manner&mdash;to me."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I saw that in his eye," replied Lake; and Withers laughed with
  him.</p>

  <p>"Nack-yal never was well broke," he said. "But he's a good mustang,
  nothing like Joe's Navvy or that gray mare Dynamite. All this Indian stock
  will buck on a man once in a while."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the bucking along with the rest," said Shefford. Both men liked
  his reply, and the Indian smiled for the first time.</p>

  <p>Soon they all sat round a spread tarpaulin and ate like wolves. After
  supper came the rest and talk before the camp-fire. Joe Lake was droll; he
  said the most serious things in a way to make Shefford wonder if he was not
  joking. Withers talked about the canyon, the Indians, the mustangs, the
  scorpions running out of the heated sand; and to Shefford it was all like a
  fascinating book. Nas Ta Bega smoked in silence, his brooding eyes upon the
  fire.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V.</a> &mdash; ON THE TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD was awakened next morning by a sound he had never
  heard before &mdash;the plunging of hobbled horses on soft turf. It was clear
  daylight, with a ruddy color in the sky and a tinge of red along the canyon
  rim. He saw Withers, Lake, and the Indian driving the mustangs toward
  camp.</p>

  <p>The burros appeared lazy, yet willing. But the mustangs and the mule
  Withers called Red and the gray mare Dynamite were determined not to be
  driven into camp. It was astonishing how much action they had, how much
  ground they could cover with their forefeet hobbled together. They were
  exceedingly skilful; they lifted both forefeet at once, and then plunged. And
  they all went in different directions. Nas Ta Bega darted in here and there
  to head off escape.</p>

  <p>Shefford pulled on his boots and went out to help. He got too close to the
  gray mare and, warned by a yell from Withers, he jumped back just in time to
  avoid her vicious heels. Then Shefford turned his attention to Nack-yal and
  chased him all over the flat in a futile effort to catch him. Nas Ta Bega
  came to Shefford's assistance and put a rope over Nack-yal's head.</p>

  <p>"Don't ever get behind one of these mustangs," said Withers, warningly, as
  Shefford came up. "You might be killed... Eat your bite now. We'll soon be
  out of here."</p>

  <p>Shefford had been late in awakening. The others had breakfasted. He found
  eating somewhat difficult in the excitement that ensued. Nas Ta Bega held
  ropes which were round the necks of Red and Dynamite. The mule showed his
  cunning and always appeared to present his heels to Withers, who tried to
  approach him with a pack-saddle. The patience of the trader was a revelation
  to Shefford. And at length Red was cornered by the three men, the pack-saddle
  was strapped on, and then the packs. Red promptly bucked the packs off, and
  the work had to be done over again. Then Red dropped his long ears and seemed
  ready to be tractable.</p>

  <p>When Shefford turned his attention to Dynamite he decided that this was
  his first sight of a wild horse. The gray mare had fiery eyes that rolled and
  showed the white. She jumped straight up, screamed, pawed, bit, and then
  plunged down to shoot her hind hoofs into the air as high as her head had
  been. She was amazingly agile and she seemed mad to kill something. She
  dragged the Indian about, and when Joe Lake got a rope on her hind foot she
  dragged them both. They lashed her with the ends of the lassoes, which action
  only made her kick harder. She plunged into camp, drove Shefford flying for
  his life, knocked down two of the burros, and played havoc with the
  unstrapped packs. Withers ran to the assistance of Lake, and the two of them
  hauled back with all their strength and weight. They were both powerful and
  heavy men. Dynamite circled round and finally, after kicking the camp-fire to
  bits, fell down on her haunches in the hot embers. "Let&mdash;her&mdash;
  set&mdash;there!" panted Withers. And Joe Lake shouted, "Burn up, you durn
  coyote!" Both men appeared delighted that she had brought upon herself just
  punishment. Dynamite sat in the remains of the fire long enough to get burnt,
  and then she got up and meekly allowed Withers to throw a tarpaulin and a
  roll of blankets over her and tie them fast.</p>

  <p>Lake and Withers were sweating freely when this job was finished.</p>

  <p>"Say, is that a usual morning's task with the pack-animals?" asked
  Shefford.</p>

  <p>"They're all pretty decent to-day, except Dynamite," replied Withers.
  "She's got to be worked out."</p>

  <p>Shefford felt both amusement and consternation. The sun was just rising
  over the ramparts of the canyon, and he had already seen more difficult and
  dangerous work accomplished than half a dozen men of his type could do in a
  whole day. He liked the outlook of his new duty as Withers's assistant, but
  he felt helplessly inefficient. Still, all he needed was experience. He
  passed over what he anticipated would be pain and peril&mdash;the cost was of
  no moment.</p>

  <p>Soon the pack-train was on the move, with the Indian leading. This morning
  Nack-yal began his strange swinging off to the left, precisely as he had done
  the day before. It got to be annoying to Shefford, and he lost patience with
  the mustang and jerked him sharply round. This, however, had no great effect
  upon Nack-yal.</p>

  <p>As the train headed straight up the canyon Joe Lake dropped back to ride
  beside Shefford. The Mormon had been amiable and friendly.</p>

  <p>"Flock of deer up that draw," he said, pointing up a narrow side
  canyon.</p>

  <p>Shefford gazed to see a half-dozen small, brown, long-eared objects, very
  like burros, watching the pack-train pass.</p>

  <p>"Are they deer?" he asked, delightedly.</p>

  <p>"Sure are," replied Joe, sincerely. "Get down and shoot one. There's a
  rifle in your saddle-sheath."</p>

  <p>Shefford had already discovered that he had been armed this morning, a
  matter which had caused him reflection. These animals certainly looked like
  deer; he had seen a few deer, though not in their native wild haunts; and he
  experienced the thrill of the hunter. Dismounting, he drew the rifle out of
  the sheath and started toward the little canyon.</p>

  <p>"Hyar! Where you going with that gun?" yelled Withers. "That's a bunch of
  burros... Joe's up to his old tricks. Shefford, look out for Joe!"</p>

  <p>Rather sheepishly Shefford returned to his mustang and sheathed the rifle,
  and then took a long look at the animals up the draw. They, resembled deer,
  but upon second glance they surely were burros.</p>

  <p>"Durn me! Now if I didn't think they sure were deer!" exclaimed Joe. He
  appeared absolutely sincere and innocent. Shefford hardly knew how to take
  this likable Mormon, but vowed he would be on his guard in the future.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega soon led the pack-train toward the left wall of the canyon,
  and evidently intended to scale it. Shefford could not see any trail, and the
  wall appeared steep and insurmountable. But upon nearing the cliff he saw a
  narrow broken trail leading zigzag up over smooth rock, weathered slope, and
  through cracks.</p>

  <p>"Spread out, and careful now!" yelled Withers.</p>

  <p>The need of both advices soon became manifest to Shefford. The burros
  started stones rolling, making danger for those below. Shefford dismounted
  and led Nack-yal and turned aside many a rolling rock. The Indian and the
  burros, with the red mule leading, climbed steadily. But the mustangs had
  trouble. Joe's spirited bay had to be coaxed to face the ascent; Nack-yal
  balked at every difficult step; and Dynamite slipped on a flat slant of rock
  and slid down forty feet. Withers and Lake with ropes hauled the mare out of
  the dangerous position. Shefford, who brought up the rear, saw all the
  action, and it was exciting, but his pleasure in the climb was spoiled by
  sight of blood and hair on the stones. The ascent was crooked, steep, and
  long, and when Shefford reached the top of the wall he was glad to rest. It
  made him gasp to look down and see what he had surmounted. The canyon floor,
  green and level, lay a thousand feet below; and the wild burros which had
  followed on the trail looked like rabbits.</p>

  <p>Shefford mounted presently, and rode out upon a wide, smooth trail leading
  into a cedar forest. There were bunches of gray sage in the open places. The
  air was cool and crisp, laden with a sweet fragrance. He saw Lake and Withers
  bobbing along, now on one side of the trail, now on the other, and they kept
  to a steady trot. Occasionally the Indian and his bright-red saddle- blanket
  showed in an opening of the cedars.</p>

  <p>It was level country, and there was nothing for Shefford to see except
  cedar and sage, an outcropping of red rock in places, and the winding trail.
  Mocking-birds made melody everywhere. Shefford seemed full of a strange
  pleasure, and the hours flew by. Nack-yal still wanted to be everlastingly
  turning off the trail, and, moreover, now he wanted to go faster. He was
  eager, restless, dissatisfied.</p>

  <p>At noon the pack-train descended into a deep draw, well covered with cedar
  and sage. There was plenty of grass and shade, but no water. Shefford was
  surprised to see that every pack was removed; however, the roll of blankets
  was left on Dynamite.</p>

  <p>The men made a fire and began to cook a noonday meal. Shefford, tired and
  warm, sat in a shady spot and watched. He had become all eyes. He had almost
  forgotten Fay Larkin; he had forgotten his trouble; and the present seemed
  sweet and full. Presently his ears were filled by a pattering roar and,
  looking up the draw, he saw two streams of sheep and goats coming down. Soon
  an Indian shepherd appeared, riding a fine mustang. A cream-colored colt
  bounded along behind, and presently a shaggy dog came in sight. The Indian
  dismounted at the camp, and his flock spread by in two white and black
  streams. The dog went with them. Withers and Joe shook hands with the Indian,
  whom Joe called "Navvy," and Shefford lost no time in doing likewise. Then
  Nas Ta Bega came in, and he and the Navajo talked. When the meal was ready
  all of them sat down round the canvas. The shepherd did not tie his
  horse.</p>

  <p>Presently Shefford noticed that Nack-yal had returned to camp and was
  acting strangely. Evidently he was attracted by the Indian's mustang or the
  cream-colored colt. At any rate, Nack-yal hung around, tossed his head,
  whinnied in a low, nervous manner, and looked strangely eager and wild.
  Shefford was at first amused, then curious. Nack-yal approached too close to
  the mother of the colt, and she gave him a sounding kick in the ribs.
  Nack-yal uttered a plaintive snort and backed away, to stand, crestfallen,
  with all his eagerness and fire vanished.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega pointed to the mustang and said something in his own tongue.
  Then Withers addressed the visiting Indian, and they exchanged some words,
  whereupon the trader turned to Shefford:</p>

  <p>"I bought Nack-yal from this Indian three years ago. This mare is Nack-
  yal's mother. He was born over here to the south. That's why he always swung
  left off the trail. He wanted to go home. Just now he recognized his mother
  and she whaled away and gave him a whack for his pains. She's got a colt now
  and probably didn't recognize Nack-yal. But he's broken-hearted."</p>

  <p>The trader laughed, and Joe said, "You can't tell what these durn mustangs
  will do." Shefford felt sorry for Nack-yal, and when it came time to saddle
  him again found him easier to handle than ever before. Nack-yal stood with
  head down, broken-spirited.</p>

  <p>Shefford was the first to ride up out of the draw, and once upon the top
  of the ridge he halted to gaze, wide-eyed and entranced. A rolling, endless
  plain sloped down beneath him, and led him on to a distant round-topped
  mountain. To the right a red canyon opened its jagged jaws, and away to the
  north rose a whorled and strange sea of curved ridges, crags, and domes.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega rode up then, leading the pack-train.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, that is Na-tsis-an," he said, pointing to the mountain. "Navajo
  Mountain. And there in the north are the canyon."</p>

  <p>Shefford followed the Indian down the trail and soon lost sight of that
  wide green-and-red wilderness. Nas Ta Bega turned at an intersecting trail,
  rode down into the canyon, and climbed out on the other side. Shefford got a
  glimpse now and then of the black dome of the mountain, but for the most part
  the distant points of the country were hidden. They crossed many trails, and
  went up and down the sides of many shallow canyon. Troops of wild mustangs
  whistled at them, stood on ridge-tops to watch, and then dashed away with
  manes and tails flying.</p>

  <p>Withers rode forward presently and halted the pack-train. He had some
  conversation with Nas Ta Bega, whereupon the Indian turned his horse and
  trotted back, to disappear in the cedars.</p>

  <p>"I'm some worried," explained Withers. "Joe thinks he saw a bunch of
  horsemen trailing us. My eyes are bad and I can't see far. The Indian will
  find out. I took a roundabout way to reach the village because I'm always
  dodging Shadd."</p>

  <p>This communication lent an added zest to the journey. Shefford could
  hardly believe the truth that his eyes and his ears brought to his
  consciousness. He turned in behind Withers and rode down the rough trail,
  helping the mustang all in his power. It occurred to him that Nack-yal had
  been entirely different since that meeting with his mother in the draw. He
  turned no more off the trail; he answered readily to the rein; he did not
  look afar from every ridge. Shefford conceived a liking for the mustang.</p>

  <p>Withers turned sidewise in his saddle and let his mustang pick the
  way.</p>

  <p>"Another time we'll go up round the base of the mountain, where you can
  look down on the grandest scene in the world," said he. "Two hundred miles of
  wind-worn rock, all smooth and bare, without a single straight line&mdash;
  canyon, caves, bridges&mdash;the most wonderful country in the world! Even
  the Indians haven't explored it. It's haunted, for them, and they have
  strange gods. The Navajos will hunt on this side of the mountain, but not on
  the other. That north side is consecrated ground. My wife has long been
  trying to get the Navajos to tell her the secret of Nonnezoshe. Nonnezoshe
  means Rainbow Bridge. The Indians worship it, but as far as she can find out
  only a few have ever seen it. I imagine it'd be worth some trouble."</p>

  <p>"Maybe that's the bridge Venters talked about&mdash;the one overarching
  the entrance to Surprise Valley," Said Shefford.</p>

  <p>"It might be," replied the trader. "You've got a good chance of finding
  out. Nas Ta Bega is the man. You stick to that Indian... Well, we start down
  here into this canyon, and we go down some, I reckon. In half an hour you'll
  see sago-lilies and Indian paint- brush and vermilion cactus."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">ABOUT the middle of the afternoon the pack-train and its
  drivers arrived at the hidden Mormon village. Nas Ta Bega had not returned
  from his scout back along the trail.</p>

  <p>Shefford's sensibilities had all been overstrained, but he had left in him
  enthusiasm and appreciation that made the situation of this village a
  fairyland. It was a valley, a canyon floor, so long that he could not see the
  end, and perhaps a quarter of a mile wide. The air was hot, still, and
  sweetly odorous of unfamiliar flowers. Pinyon and cedar trees surrounded the
  little log and stone houses, and along the walls of the canyon stood
  sharp-pointed, dark- green spruce-trees. These walls were singular of shape
  and color. They were not imposing in height, but they waved like the long,
  undulating swell of a sea. Every foot of surface was perfectly smooth, and
  the long curved lines of darker tinge that streaked the red followed the
  rounded line of the slope at the top. Far above, yet overhanging, were great
  yellow crags and peaks, and between these, still higher, showed the
  pine-fringed slope of Navajo Mountain with snow in the sheltered places, and
  glistening streams, like silver threads, running down.</p>

  <p>All this Shefford noticed as he entered the valley from round a corner of
  wall. Upon nearer view he saw and heard a host of children, who, looking up
  to see the intruders, scattered like frightened quail. Long gray grass
  covered the ground, and here and there wide, smooth paths had been worn. A
  swift and murmuring brook ran through the middle of the valley, and its banks
  were bordered with flowers.</p>

  <p>Withers led the way to one side near the wall, where a clump of cedar-
  trees and a dark, swift spring boiling out of the rocks and banks of amber
  moss with purple blossoms made a beautiful camp site. Here the mustangs were
  unsaddled and turned loose without hobbles. It was certainly unlikely that
  they would leave such a spot. Some of the burros were unpacked, and the
  others Withers drove off into the village.</p>

  <p>"Sure's pretty nice," said Joe, wiping his sweaty face. "I'll never want
  to leave. It suits me to lie on this moss... Take a drink of that
  spring."</p>

  <p>Shefford complied with alacrity and found the water cool and sweet, and he
  seemed to feel it all through him. Then he returned to the mossy bank. He did
  not reply to Joe. In fact, all his faculties were absorbed in watching and
  feeling, and he lay there long after Joe went off to the village. The murmur
  of water, the hum of bees, the songs of strange birds, the sweet, warm air,
  the dreamy summer somnolence of the valley&mdash;all these added drowsiness
  to Shefford's weary lassitude, and he fell asleep. When he awoke Nas Ta Bega
  was sitting near him and Joe was busy near a camp-fire.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Nas Ta Bega!" said Shefford. "Was there any one trailing us?"</p>

  <p>The Navajo nodded.</p>

  <p>Joe raised his head and with forceful brevity said, "Shadd."</p>

  <p>"Shadd!" echoed Shefford, remembering the dark, sinister face of his
  visitor that night in the Sagi. "Joe, is it serious&mdash;his trailing
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know how durn serious it is, but I'm scared to death,"
  replied Lake. "He and his gang will hold us up somewhere on the way
  home."</p>

  <p>Shefford regarded Joe with both concern and doubt. Joe's words were at
  variance with his looks.</p>

  <p>"Say, pard, can you shoot a rifle?" queried Joe.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm a fair shot at targets."</p>

  <p>The Mormon nodded his head as if pleased. "That's good. These outlaws are
  all poor shots with a rifle. So 'm I. But I can handle a six-shooter. I
  reckon we'll make Shadd sweat if he pushes us."</p>

  <p>Withers returned, driving the burros, all of which had been unpacked down
  to the saddles. Two gray-bearded men accompanied him. One of them appeared to
  be very old and venerable, and walked with a stick. The other had a sad-lined
  face and kind, mild blue eyes. Shefford observed that Lake seemed unusually
  respectful. Withers introduced these Mormons merely as Smith and Henninger.
  They were very cordial and pleasant in their greetings to Shefford. Presently
  another, somewhat younger, man joined the group, a stalwart, jovial fellow
  with ruddy face. There was certainly no mistaking his kindly welcome as he
  shook Shefford's hand. His name was Beal. The three stood round the camp-fire
  for a while, evidently glad of the presence of fellow-men and to hear news
  from the outside. Finally they went away, taking Joe with them. Withers took
  up the task of getting supper where Joe had been made to leave it.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, listen," he said, presently, as he knelt before the fire. "I
  told them right out that you'd been a Gentile clergyman&mdash;that you'd gone
  back on your religion. It impressed them and you've been well received. I'll
  tell the same thing over at Stonebridge. You'll get in right. Of course I
  don't expect they'll make a Mormon of you. But they'll try to. Meanwhile you
  can be square and friendly all the time you're trying to find your Fay
  Larkin. To- morrow you'll meet some of the women. They're good souls, but,
  like any women, crazy for news. Think what it is to be shut up in here
  between these walls!"</p>

  <p>"Withers, I'm intensely interested," replied Shefford, "and excited, too.
  Shall we stay here long?"</p>

  <p>"I'll stay a couple of days, then go to Stonebridge with Joe. He'll come
  back here, and when you both feel like leaving, and if Nas Ta Bega thinks it
  safe, you'll take a trail over to some Indian hogans and pack me out a load
  of skins and blankets... My boy, you've all the time there is, and I wish you
  luck. This isn't a bad place to loaf. I always get sentimental over here.
  Maybe it's the women. Some of them are pretty, and one of them&mdash;
  Shefford, they call her the Sago Lily. Her first name is Mary, I'm told.
  Don't know her last name. She's lovely. And I'll bet you forget Fay Larkin in
  a flash. Only&mdash;be careful. You drop in here with rather peculiar
  credentials, so to speak&mdash;as my helper and as a man with no religion!
  You'll not only be fully trusted, but you'll be welcome to these lonely
  women. So be careful. Remember it's my secret belief they are sealed wives
  and are visited occasionally at night by their husbands. I don't know this,
  but I believe it. And you're not supposed to dream of that."</p>

  <p>"How many men in the village?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Three. You met them."</p>

  <p>"Have they wives?" asked Shefford, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Wives! Well, I guess. But only one each that I know of. Joe Lake is the
  only unmarried Mormon I've met."</p>

  <p>"And no men&mdash;strangers, cowboys, outlaws&mdash;ever come to this
  village?"</p>

  <p>"Except to Indians, it seems to be a secret so far," replied the trader,
  earnestly. "But it can't be kept secret. I've said that time after time over
  in Stonebridge. With Mormons it's 'sufficient unto the day is the evil
  thereof.'"</p>

  <p>"What'll happen when outsiders do learn and ride in here?"</p>

  <p>"There'll be trouble&mdash;maybe bloodshed. Mormon women are absolutely
  good, but they're human, and want and need a little life. And, strange to
  say, Mormon men are pig-headedly jealous... Why, if some of the cowboys I
  knew in Durango would ride over here there'd simply be hell. But that's a
  long way, and probably this village will be deserted before news of it ever
  reaches Colorado. There's more danger of Shadd and his gang coming in.
  Shadd's half Piute. He must know of this place. And he's got some white
  outlaws in his gang... Come on. Grub's ready, and I'm too hungry to
  talk."</p>

  <p>Later, when shadows began to gather in the valley and the lofty peaks
  above were gold in the sunset glow, Withers left camp to look after the
  straying mustangs, and Shefford strolled to and fro under the cedars. The
  lights and shades in the Sagi that first night had moved him to enthusiastic
  watchfulness, but here they were so weird and beautiful that he was
  enraptured. He actually saw great shafts of gold and shadows of purple
  streaming from the peaks down into the valley. It was day on the heights and
  twilight in the valley. The swiftly changing colors were like rainbows.</p>

  <p>While he strolled up and down several women came to the spring and filled
  their buckets. They wore shawls or hoods and their garments were somber, but,
  nevertheless, they appeared to have youth and comeliness. They saw him,
  looked at him curiously, and then, without speaking, went back on the
  well-trodden path. Presently down the path appeared a woman&mdash;a girl in
  lighter garb. It was almost white. She was shapely and walked with free,
  graceful step, reminding him of the Indian girl, Glen Naspa. This one wore a
  hood shaped like a huge sunbonnet and it concealed her face. She carried a
  bucket. When she reached the spring and went down the few stone steps
  Shefford saw that she did not have on shoes. As she braced herself to lift
  the bucket her bare foot clung to the mossy stone. It was a strong, sinewy,
  beautiful foot, instinct with youth. He was curious enough, he thought, but
  the awakening artist in him made him more so. She dragged at the full bucket
  and had difficulty in lifting it out of the hole. Shefford strode forward and
  took the bucket-handle from her.</p>

  <p>"Won't you let me help you?" he said, lifting the bucket. "Indeed&mdash;
  it's very heavy."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;thank you," she said, without raising her head. Her voice seemed
  singularly young and sweet. He had not heard a voice like it. She moved down
  the path and he walked beside her. He felt embarrassed, yet more curious than
  ever; he wanted to say something, to turn and look at her, but he kept on for
  a dozen paces without making up his mind.</p>

  <p>Finally he said: "Do you really carry this heavy bucket? Why, it makes my
  arm ache."</p>

  <p>"Twice every day&mdash;morning and evening," she replied. "I'm very
  strong."</p>

  <p>Then he stole a look out of the corner of his eye, and, seeing that her
  face was hidden from him by the hood, he turned to observe her at better
  advantage. A long braid of hair hung down her back. In the twilight it
  gleamed dull gold. She came up to his shoulder. The sleeve nearest him was
  rolled up to her elbow, revealing a fine round arm. Her hand, like her foot,
  was brown, strong, and well shaped. It was a hand that had been developed by
  labor. She was full-bosomed, yet slender, and she walked with a free stride
  that made Shefford admire and wonder.</p>

  <p>They passed several of the little stone and log houses, and women greeted
  them as they went by and children peered shyly from the doors. He kept trying
  to think of something to say, and, failing in that, determined to have one
  good look under the hood before he left her.</p>

  <p>"You walk lame," she said, solicitously. "Let me carry the bucket now
  &mdash;please. My house is near."</p>

  <p>"Am I lame?... Guess so, a little," he replied. "It was a hard ride for
  me. But I'll carry the bucket just the same."</p>

  <p>They went on under some pinyon-trees, down a path to a little house
  identical with the others, except that it had a stone porch. Shefford smelled
  fragrant wood-smoke and saw a column curling from the low, flat, stone
  chimney. Then he set the bucket down on the porch. "Thank you, Mr. Shefford,"
  she said. "You know my name?" he asked. "Yes. Mr. Withers spoke to my nearest
  neighbor and she told me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. And you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not go on and she did not reply. When she stepped upon the porch
  and turned he was able to see under the hood. The face there was in shadow,
  and for that very reason he answered to ungovernable impulse and took a step
  closer to her. Dark, grave, sad eyes looked down at him, and he felt as if he
  could never draw his own glance away. He seemed not to see the rest of her
  face, and yet felt that it was lovely. Then a downward movement of the hood
  hid from him the strange eyes and the shadowy loveliness.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," he said, quickly, drawing back. "I'm rude ...
  Withers told me about a girl he called&mdash;he said looked like a sago-
  lily. That's no excuse to stare under your hood. But I&mdash;I was curious. I
  wondered if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, realizing how foolish his talk was. She stood a moment,
  probably watching him, but he could not be sure, for her face was hidden.</p>

  <p>"They call me that," she said. "But my name is Mary."</p>

  <p>"Mary&mdash;what?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just Mary," she said, simply. "Good night."</p>

  <p>He did not say good night and could not have told why. She took up the
  bucket and went into the dark house. Shefford hurried away into the gathering
  darkness.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI.</a> &mdash; IN THE HIDDEN VALLEY</h2>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD had hardly seen her face, yet he was more
  interested in a woman than he had ever been before. Still, he reflected, as
  he returned to camp, he had been under a long strain, he was unduly excited
  by this new and adventurous life, and these, with the mystery of this
  village, were perhaps accountable for a state of mind that could not
  last.</p>

  <p>He rolled in his blankets on the soft bed of moss and he saw the stars
  through the needle-like fringe of the pinyons. It seemed impossible to fall
  asleep. The two domed peaks split the sky, and back of them, looming dark and
  shadowy, rose the mountain. There was something cold, austere, and majestic
  in their lofty presence, and they made him feel alone, yet not alone. He
  raised himself to see the quiet forms of Withers and Nas Ta Bega prone in the
  starlight, and their slow, deep breathing was that of tired men. A bell on a
  mustang rang somewhere off in the valley and gave out a low, strange,
  reverberating echo from wall to wall. When it ceased a silence set in that
  was deader than any silence he had ever felt, but gradually he became aware
  of the low murmur of the brook. For the rest there was no sound of wind, no
  bark of dog or yelp of coyote, no sound of voice in the village.</p>

  <p>He tried to sleep, but instead thought of this girl who was called the
  Sago Lily. He recalled everything incident to their meeting and the walk to
  her home. Her swift, free step, her graceful poise, her shapely form&mdash;
  the long braid of hair, dull gold in the twilight, the beautiful bare foot
  and the strong round arm&mdash;these he thought of and recalled vividly. But
  of her face he had no idea except the shadowy, haunting loveliness, and that
  grew more and more difficult to remember. The tone of her voice and what she
  had said&mdash;how the one had thrilled him and the other mystified! It was
  her voice that had most attracted him. There was something in it besides
  music&mdash;what, he could not tell&mdash;sadness, depth, something like that
  in Nas Ta Bega's beauty springing from disuse. But this seemed absurd. Why
  should he imagine her voice one that had not been used as freely as any other
  woman's? She was a Mormon; very likely, almost surely, she was a sealed wife.
  His interest, too, was absurd, and he tried to throw it off, or imagine it
  one he might have felt in any other of these strange women of the hidden
  village.</p>

  <p>But Shefford's intelligence and his good sense, which became operative
  when he was fully roused and set the situation clearly before his eyes, had
  no effect upon his deeper, mystic, and primitive feelings. He saw the truth
  and he felt something that he could not name. He would not be a fool, but
  there was no harm in dreaming. And unquestionably, beyond all doubt, the
  dream and the romance that had lured him to the wilderness were here; hanging
  over him like the shadows of the great peaks. His heart swelled with emotion
  when he thought of how the black and incessant despair of the past was gone.
  So he embraced any attraction that made him forget and think and feel; some
  instinct stronger than intelligence bade him drift.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">JOE'S rolling voice awoke him next morning and he rose with
  a singular zest. When or where in his life had he awakened in such a
  beautiful place? Almost he understood why Venters and Bess had been haunted
  by memories of Surprise Valley. The morning was clear, cool, sweet; the peaks
  were dim and soft in rosy cloud; shafts of golden sunlight shot down into the
  purple shadows. Mocking-birds were singing. His body was sore and tired from
  the unaccustomed travel, but his heart was full, happy. His spirit wanted to
  run, and he knew there was something out there waiting to meet it. The Indian
  and the trader and the Mormon all meant more to him this morning. He had
  grown a little overnight. Nas Ta Bega's deep "Bi Nai" rang in his ears, and
  the smiles of Withers and Joe were greetings. He had friends; he had work;
  and there was rich, strange, and helpful life to live. There was even a
  difference in the mustang Nack-yal. He came readily; he did not look wild; he
  had a friendly eye; and Shefford liked him more.</p>

  <p>"What is there to do?" asked Shefford, feeling equal to a hundred
  tasks.</p>

  <p>"No work," replied the trader, with a laugh, and he drew Shefford aside,
  "I'm in no hurry. I like it here. And Joe never wants to leave. To-day you
  can meet the women. Make yourself popular. I've already made you that. These
  women are most all young and lonesome. Talk to them. Make them like you. Then
  some day you may be safe to ask questions. Last night I wanted to ask old
  Mother Smith if she ever heard the name Fay Larkin. But I thought better of
  it. If there's a girl here or at Stonebridge of that name we'll learn it. If
  there's mystery we'd better go slow. Mormons are hell on secret and mystery,
  and to pry into their affairs is to queer yourself. My advice is&mdash;just
  be as nice as you can be, and let things happen."</p>

  <p>Fay Larkin! All in a night Shefford had forgotten her. Why? He pondered
  over the matter, and then the old thrill, the old desire, came back.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, what do you think Nas Ta Bega said to me last night?" asked
  Withers in lower voice.</p>

  <p>"Haven't any idea," replied Shefford, curiously.</p>

  <p>"We were sitting beside the fire. I saw you walking under the cedars. You
  seemed thoughtful. That keen Indian watched you, and he said to me in Navajo,
  'Bi Nai has lost his God. He has come far to find a wife. Nas Ta Bega is his
  brother.'... He meant he'll find both God and wife for you. I don't know
  about that, but I say take the Indian as he thinks he is&mdash;your brother.
  Long before I knew Nas Ta Bega well my wife used to tell me about him. He's a
  sage and a poet&mdash;the very spirit of this desert. He's worth cultivating
  for his own sake. But more&mdash;remember, if Fay Larkin is still shut in
  that valley the Navajo will find her for you."</p>

  <p>"I shall take Nas Ta Bega as my brother&mdash;and be proud," replied
  Shefford.</p>

  <p>"There's another thing. Do you intend to confide in Joe?"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought of that."</p>

  <p>"Well, it might be a good plan. But wait until you know him better and he
  knows you. He's ready to fight for you now. He's taken your trouble to heart.
  You wouldn't think Joe is deeply religious. Yet he is. He may never breathe a
  word about religion to you... Now, Shefford, go ahead. You've struck a trail.
  It's rough, but it'll make a man of you. It'll lead somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I'm singularly fortunate&mdash;I&mdash;who had lost all friends. Withers,
  I am grateful. I'll prove it. I'll show&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Withers's upheld hand checked further speech, and Shefford realized that
  beneath the rough exterior of this desert trader there was fine feeling.
  These men of crude toil and wild surroundings were beginning to loom up large
  in Shefford's mind.</p>

  <p>The day began leisurely. The men were yet at breakfast when the women of
  the village began to come one by one to the spring. Joe Lake made friendly
  and joking remarks to each. And as each one passed on down the path he poised
  a biscuit in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, and with his head
  cocked sidewise like an owl he said, "Reckon I've got to get me a woman like
  her."</p>

  <p>Shefford saw and heard, yet he was all the time half unconsciously
  watching with strange eagerness for a white figure to appear. At last he saw
  her&mdash;the same girl with the hood, the same swift step. A little shock or
  quiver passed over him, and at the moment all that was explicable about it
  was something associated with regret.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake whistled and stared.</p>

  <p>"I haven't met her," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"That's the Sago Lily," said Withers.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I'm going to carry that bucket," went on Joe.</p>

  <p>"And queer yourself with all the other women who've been to the spring?
  Don't do it, Joe," advised the trader.</p>

  <p>"But her bucket's bigger," protested Joe, weakly.</p>

  <p>"That's true. But you ought to know Mormons. If she'd come first, all
  right. As she didn't&mdash;why, don't single her out."</p>

  <p>Joe kept his seat. The girl came to the spring. A low "good morning" came
  from under the hood. Then she filled her bucket and started home. Shefford
  observed that this time she wore moccasins and she carried the heavy bucket
  with ease. When she disappeared he had again the vague, inexplicable
  sensation of regret.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake breathed heavily. "Reckon I've got to get me a woman like her,"
  he said. But the former jocose tone was lacking and he appeared
  thoughtful.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">WITHERS first took Shefford to the building used for a
  school. It was somewhat larger than the other houses, had only one room with
  two doors and several windows. It was full of children, of all sizes and
  ages, sitting on rude board benches.</p>

  <p>There were half a hundred of them, sturdy, healthy, rosy boys and girls,
  dad in home-made garments. The young woman teacher was as embarrassed as her
  pupils were shy, and the visitors withdrew without having heard a word of
  lessons.</p>

  <p>Withers then called upon Smith, Henninger, and Beal, and their wives.
  Shefford found himself cordially received, and what little he did say showed
  him how he would be listened to when he cared to talk. These folk were plain
  and kindly, and he found that there was nothing about them to dislike. The
  men appeared mild and quiet, and when not conversing seemed austere. The
  repose of the women was only on the surface; underneath he felt their
  intensity. Especially in many of the younger women, whom he met in the
  succeeding hour, did he feel this power of restrained emotion. This surprised
  him, as did also the fact that almost every one of them was attractive and
  some of them were exceedingly pretty. He became so interested in them all as
  a whole that he could not individualize one. They were as widely different in
  appearance and temperament as women of any other class, but it seemed to
  Shefford that one common trait united them&mdash;and it was a strange,
  checked yearning for something that he could not discover. Was it happiness?
  They certainly seemed to be happy, far more so than those millions of women
  who were chasing phantoms. Were they really sealed wives, as Withers
  believed, and was this unnatural wife-hood responsible for the strange
  intensity? At any rate he returned to camp with the conviction that he had
  stumbled upon a remarkable situation.</p>

  <p>He had been told the last names of only three women, and their husbands
  were in the village. The names of the others were Ruth, Rebecca, Joan&mdash;
  he could not recall them all. They were the mothers of these beautiful
  children. The fathers, as far as he was concerned, were as intangible as
  myths. Shefford was an educated clergyman, a man of the world, and, as such,
  knew women in his way. Mormons might be strange and different, yet the
  fundamental truth was that all over the world mothers of children were wives;
  there was a relation between wife and mother that did not need to be named to
  be felt; and he divined from this that, whatever the situation of these
  lonely and hidden women, they knew themselves to be wives. Shefford
  absolutely satisfied himself on that score. If they were miserable they
  certainly did not show it, and the question came to him how just was the
  criticism of uninformed men? His judgment of Mormons had been established by
  what he had heard and read, rather than what he knew. He wanted now to have
  an open mind. He had studied the totemism and exogamy of the primitive races,
  and here was his opportunity to understand polygamy. One wife for one man
  &mdash;that was the law. Mormons broke it openly; Gentiles broke it secretly.
  Mormons acknowledged all their wives and protected their children; Gentiles
  acknowledged one wife only. Unquestionably the Mormons were wrong, but were
  not the Gentiles still more wrong?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE following day Joe Lake appeared reluctant to start for
  Stonebridge with Withers.</p>

  <p>"Joe, you'd better come along," said the trader, dryly. "I reckon you've
  seen a little too much of the Sago Lily."</p>

  <p>Lake offered no reply, but it was evident from his sober face that Withers
  had not hit short of the mark. Withers rode off, with a parting word to
  Shefford, and finally Joe somberly mounted his bay and trotted down the
  valley. As Nas Ta Bega had gone off somewhere to visit Indians, Shefford was
  left alone.</p>

  <p>He went into the village and made himself useful and agreeable. He made
  friends with the children and he talked to the women until he was hoarse.
  Their ignorance of the world was a spur to him, and never in his life had he
  had such an attentive audience. And as he showed no curiosity, asked no
  difficult questions, gradually what reserve he had noted wore away, and the
  end of the day saw him on a footing with them that Withers had predicted.</p>

  <p>By the time several like days had passed it seemed from the interest and
  friendliness of these women that he might have lived long among them. He was
  possessed of wit and eloquence and information, which he freely gave, and not
  with selfish motive. He liked these women; he liked to see the somber shade
  pass from their faces, to see them brighten. He had met the girl Mary at the
  spring and along the path, but he had not yet seen her face. He was always
  looking for her, hoping to meet her, and confessed to himself that the best
  of the day for him were the morning and evening visits she made to the
  spring. Nevertheless, for some reason hard to divine, he was reluctant to
  seek her deliberately.</p>

  <p>Always while he had listened to her neighbors' talk, he had hoped they
  might let fall something about her. But they did not. He received an
  impression that she was not so intimate with the others as he had supposed.
  They all made one big family. Still, she seemed a little outside. He could
  bring no proofs to strengthen this idea. He merely felt it, and many of his
  feelings were independent of intelligent reason. Something had been added to
  curiosity, that was sure.</p>

  <p>It was his habit to call upon Mother Smith in the afternoons. From the
  first her talk to him hinted of a leaning toward thought of making him a
  Mormon. Her husband and the other men took up her cue and spoke of their
  religion, casually at first, but gradually opening their minds to free and
  simple discussion of their faith. Shefford lent respectful attention. He
  would rather have been a Mormon than an atheist, and apparently they
  considered him the latter, and were earnest to save his soul. Shefford knew
  that he could never be one any more than the other. He was just at sea. But
  he listened, and he found them simple in faith, blind, perhaps, but loyal and
  good. It was noteworthy that Mother Smith happened to be the only woman in
  the village who had ever mentioned religion to him. She was old, of a past
  generation; the young women belonged to the present. Shefford pondered the
  significant difference.</p>

  <p>Every day made more steadfast his impression of the great mystery that was
  like a twining shadow round these women, yet in the same time many little
  ideas shifted and many new characteristics became manifest. This last was of
  course the result of acquaintance; he was learning more about the villagers.
  He gathered from keen interpretation of subtle words and looks that here in
  this lonely village, the same as in all the rest of the world where women
  were together, there were cliques, quarrels, dislikes, loves, and jealousies.
  The truth, once known to him, made him feel natural and fortified his
  confidence to meet the demands of an increasingly interesting position. He
  discovered, with a somewhat grim amusement, that a clergyman's experience in
  a church full of women had not been entirely useless.</p>

  <p>One afternoon he let fall a careless remark that was a subtle question in
  regard to the girl Mary, whom Withers called the Sago Lily. In response he
  received an answer couched in the sweet poisoned honey of woman's jealousy.
  He said no more. Certain ideas of his were strengthened, and straightway he
  became thoughtful.</p>

  <p>That afternoon late, as he did his camp chores, he watched for her. But
  she did not come. Then he decided to go to see her. But even the decision and
  the strange thrill it imparted did not change his reluctance.</p>

  <p>Twilight was darkening the valley when he reached her house, and the
  shadows were thick under the pinyons. There was no light in the door or
  window. He saw a white shape on the porch, and as he came down the path it
  rose. It was the girl Mary, and she appeared startled.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said. "It's Shefford. May I stay and talk a little
  while?"</p>

  <p>She was silent for so long that he began to feel awkward.</p>

  <p>"I'd be glad to have you," she replied, finally.</p>

  <p>There was a bench on the porch, but he preferred to sit upon a blanket on
  the step.</p>

  <p>"I've been getting acquainted with everybody&mdash;except you," he went
  on.</p>

  <p>"I have been here," she replied.</p>

  <p>That might have been a woman's speech, but it certainly had been made in a
  girl's voice. She was neither shy nor embarrassed nor self-conscious. As she
  stood back from him he could not see her face in the dense twilight.</p>

  <p>"I've been wanting to call on you."</p>

  <p>She made some slight movement. Shefford felt a strange calm, yet he knew
  the moment was big and potent.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She complied with his wish, and then he saw her face, though dimly, in the
  twilight. And it struck him mute. But he had no glimpse such as had flashed
  upon him from under her hood that other night. He thought of a white flower
  in shadow, and received his first impression of the rare and perfect lily
  Withers had said graced the wild canyon. She was only a girl. She sat very
  still, looking straight before her, and seemed to be waiting, listening.
  Shefford saw the quick rise and fall of her bosom.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk," he began, swiftly, hoping to put her at her ease. "Every
  one here has been good to me and I've talked&mdash;oh, for hours and hours.
  But the thing in my mind I haven't spoken of. I've never asked any questions.
  That makes my part so strange. I want to tell why I came out here. I need
  some one who will keep my secret, and perhaps help me... Would you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if I could," she replied.</p>

  <p>"You see I've got to trust you, or one of these other women. You're all
  Mormons. I don't mean that's anything against you. I believe you're all good
  and noble. But the fact makes&mdash;well, makes a liberty of speech
  impossible. What can I do?"</p>

  <p>Her silence probably meant that she did not know. Shefford sensed less
  strain in her and more excitement. He believed he was on the right track and
  did not regret his impulse. Even had he regretted it he would have gone on,
  for opposed to caution and intelligence was his driving mystic force.</p>

  <p>Then he told her the truth about his boyhood, his ambition to be an
  artist, his renunciation to his father's hope, his career as a clergyman, his
  failure in religion, and the disgrace that had made him a wanderer.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I'm sorry!" she said. The faint starlight shone on her face, in
  her eyes, and if he ever saw beauty and soul he saw them then. She seemed
  deeply moved. She had forgotten herself. She betrayed girlhood then&mdash;
  all the quick sympathy, the wonder, the sweetness of a heart innocent and
  untutored. She looked at him with great, starry, questioning eyes, as if they
  had just become aware of his presence, as if a man had been strange to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. It's good of you to be sorry," he said. "My instinct guided me
  right. Perhaps you'll be my friend."</p>

  <p>"I will be&mdash;if I can," she said.</p>

  <p>"But CAN you be?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I never had a friend. I... But, sir, I mustn't talk of
  myself... Oh, I'm afraid I can't help you."</p>

  <p>How strange the pathos of her voice! Almost he believed she was in need of
  help or sympathy or love. But he could not wholly trust a judgment formed
  from observation of a class different from hers.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you CAN help me. Let's see," he said. "I don't seek to make you
  talk of yourself. But&mdash;you're a human being&mdash;a girl&mdash; almost a
  woman. You're not dumb. But even a nun can talk."</p>

  <p>"A nun? What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;a nun is a sister of mercy&mdash;a woman consecrated to
  God&mdash;who has renounced the world. In some ways you Mormon women here
  resemble nuns. It is sacrifice that nails you in this lonely valley... You
  see&mdash;how I talk! One word, one thought brings another, and I speak what
  perhaps should be unsaid. And it's hard, because I feel I could unburden
  myself to you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you want," she said.</p>

  <p>Shefford hesitated, and became aware of the rapid pound of his heart. More
  than anything he wanted to be fair to this girl. He saw that she was warming
  to his influence. Her shadowy eyes were fixed upon him. The starlight,
  growing brighter, shone on her golden hair and white face.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you presently," he said. "I've trusted you. I'll trust you with
  all... But let me have my own time. This is so strange a thing, my wanting to
  confide in you. It's selfish, perhaps. I have my own ax to grind. I hope I
  won't wrong you. That's why I'm going to be perfectly frank. I might wait for
  days to get better acquainted. But the impulse is on me. I've been so
  interested in all you Mormon women. The fact&mdash;the meaning of this hidden
  village is so&mdash;so terrible to me. But that's none of my business. I have
  spent my afternoons and evenings with these women at the different cottages.
  You do not mingle with them. They are lonely, but have not such loneliness as
  yours. I have passed here every night. No light &mdash;no sound. I can't help
  thinking. Don't censure me or be afraid or draw within yourself just because
  I must think. I may be all wrong. But I'm curious. I wonder about you. Who
  are you? Mary&mdash;Mary what? Maybe I really don't want to know. I came with
  selfish motive and now I'd like to &mdash;to&mdash;what shall I say? Make
  your life a little less lonely for the while I'm here. That's all. It needn't
  offend. And if you accept it, how much easier I can tell you my secret. You
  are a Mormon and I&mdash;well, I am only a wanderer in these wilds.
  But&mdash;we might help each other... Have I made a mistake?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no," she cried, almost wildly.</p>

  <p>"We can be friends then. You will trust me, help me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if I dare."</p>

  <p>"Surely you may dare what the other women would?"</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>And the wistfulness of her silence touched him. He felt contrition. He did
  not stop to analyze his own emotions, but he had an inkling that once this
  strange situation was ended he would have food for reflection. What struck
  him most now was the girl's blanched face, the strong, nervous clasp of her
  hands, the visible tumult of her bosom. Excitement alone could not be
  accountable for this. He had not divined the cause for such agitation. He was
  puzzled, troubled, and drawn irresistibly. He had not said what he had
  planned to say. The moment had given birth to his speech, and it had flowed.
  What was guiding him?</p>

  <p>"Mary," he said, earnestly, "tell me&mdash;have you mother, father,
  sister, brother? Something prompts me to ask that."</p>

  <p>"All dead&mdash;gone&mdash;years ago," she answered.</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen, I think. I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>"You ARE lonely."</p>

  <p>His words were gentle and divining.</p>

  <p>"O God!" she cried. "Lonely!"</p>

  <p>Then as a man in a dream he beheld her weeping. There was in her the
  unconsciousness of a child and the passion of a woman. He gazed out into the
  dark shadows and up at the white stars, and then at the bowed head with its
  mass of glinting hair. But her agitation was no longer strange to him. A few
  gentle and kind words had proved her undoing. He knew then that whatever her
  life was, no kindness or sympathy entered it. Presently she recovered, and
  sat as before, only whiter of face it seemed, and with something tragic in
  her dark eyes. She was growing cold and still again, aloof, more like those
  other Mormon women.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said. "I'm not sorry I spoke. I felt your trouble,
  whatever it is... Do not retreat into your cold shell, I beg of you... Let me
  trust you with my secret."</p>

  <p>He saw her shake out of the cold apathy. She wavered. He felt an
  inexplicable sweetness in the power his voice seemed to have upon her. She
  bowed her head in acquiescence. And Shefford began his story. Did she grow
  still, like stone, or was that only his vivid imagination? He told her of
  Venters and Bess&mdash;of Lassiter and Jane&mdash;of little Fay Larkin
  &mdash;of the romance, and then the tragedy of Surprise Valley.</p>

  <p>"So, when my Church disowned me," he concluded, "I conceived the idea of
  wandering into the wilds of Utah to save Fay Larkin from that canyon prison.
  It grew to be the best and strongest desire of my life. I think if I could
  save her that it would save me. I never loved any girl. I can't say that I
  love Fay Larkin. How could I when I've never seen her&mdash;when she's only a
  dream girl? But I believe if she were to become a reality&mdash;a
  flesh-and-blood girl&mdash;that I would love her."</p>

  <p>That was more than Shefford had ever confessed to any one, and it stirred
  him to his depths. Mary bent her head on her hands in strange, stonelike
  rigidity.</p>

  <p>"So here I am in the canyon country," he continued. "Withers tells me it
  is a country of rainbows, both in the evanescent air and in the changeless
  stone. Always as a boy there had been for me some haunting promise, some
  treasure at the foot of the rainbow. I shall expect the curve of a rainbow to
  lead me down into Surprise Valley. A dreamer, you will call me. But I have
  had strange dreams come true... Mary, do you think THIS dream will come
  true?"</p>

  <p>She was silent so long that he repeated his question.</p>

  <p>"Only&mdash;in heaven," she whispered.</p>

  <p>He took her reply strangely and a chill crept over him.</p>

  <p>"You think my plan to seek to strive, to find&mdash;you think that idle,
  vain?"</p>

  <p>"I think it noble... Thank God I've met a man like you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't praise me!" he exclaimed, hastily. "Only help me... Mary, will you
  answer a few little questions, if I swear by my honor I'll never reveal what
  you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try."</p>

  <p>He moistened his lips. Why did she seem so strange, so far away? The
  hovering shadows made him nervous. Always he had been afraid of the dark. His
  mood now admitted of unreal fancies.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of Fay Larkin?" he asked, very low.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Was there only one Fay Larkin?"</p>

  <p>"Only one."</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;ever see her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," came the faint reply.</p>

  <p>He was grateful. How she might be breaking faith with creed or duty! He
  had not dared to hope so much. All his inner being trembled at the portent of
  his next query. He had not dreamed it would be so hard to put, or would
  affect him so powerfully. A warmth, a glow, a happiness pervaded his spirit;
  and the chill, the gloom were as if they had never been.</p>

  <p>"Where is Fay Larkin now?" he asked, huskily.</p>

  <p>He bent over her, touched her, leaned close to catch her whisper.</p>

  <p>"She is&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>Slowly Shefford rose, with a sickening shock, and then in bitter pain he
  strode away into the starlight.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">VII.</a> &mdash; SAGO-LILIES</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Indian returned to camp that night, and early the next
  day, which was Sunday, Withers rode in, accompanied by a stout, gray-bearded
  personage wearing a long black coat.</p>

  <p>"Bishop Kane, this is my new man, John Shefford," said the trader.</p>

  <p>Shefford acknowledged the introduction with the respectful courtesy
  evidently in order, and found himself being studied intently by clear blue
  eyes. The bishop appeared old, dry, and absorbed in thought; he spoke
  quaintly, using in every speech some Biblical word or phrase; and he had an
  air of authority. He asked Shefford to hear him preach at the morning
  service, and then he went off into the village.</p>

  <p>"Guess he liked your looks," remarked Withers.</p>

  <p>"He certainly sized me up," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Well, what could you expect? Sure I never heard of a deal like this
  &mdash;a handsome young fellow left alone with a lot of pretty Mormon women!
  You'll understand when you learn to know Mormons. Bishop Kane's a square old
  chap. Crazy on religion, maybe, but otherwise he's a good fellow. I made the
  best stand I could for you. The Mormons over at Stonebridge were huffy
  because I hadn't consulted them before fetching you over here. If I had, of
  course you'd never have gotten here. It was Joe Lake who made it all right
  with them. Joe's well thought of, and he certainly stood up for you."</p>

  <p>"I owe him something, then," replied Shefford. "Hope my obligations don't
  grow beyond me. Did you leave Joe at Stonebridge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He wanted to stay, and I had work there that'll keep him awhile.
  Shefford, we got news of Shadd&mdash;bad news. The half-breed's cutting up
  rough. His gang shot up some Piutes over here across the line. Then he got
  run out of Durango a few weeks ago for murder. A posse of cowboys trailed
  him. But he slipped them. He's a fox. You know he was trailing us here. He
  left the trail, Nas Ta Bega said. I learned at Stonebridge that Shadd is well
  disposed toward Mormons. It takes the Mormons to handle Indians. Shadd knows
  of this village and that's why he shunted off our trail. But he might hang
  down in the pass and wait for us. I think I'd better go back to Kayenta
  alone, across country. You stay here till Joe and the Indian think it safe to
  leave. You'll be going up on the slope of Navajo to load a pack-train, and
  from there it may be well to go down West Canyon to Red Lake, and home over
  the divide, the way you came. Joe'll decide what's best. And you might as
  well buckle on a gun and get used to it. Sooner or later you'll have to shoot
  your way through."</p>

  <p>Shefford did not respond with his usual enthusiasm, and the omission
  caused the trader to scrutinize him closely.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he queried. "There's no light in your eye to-day. You
  look a little shady."</p>

  <p>"I didn't rest well last night," replied Shefford. "I'm depressed this
  morning. But I'll cheer up directly."</p>

  <p>"Did you get along with the women?"</p>

  <p>"Very well indeed. And I've enjoyed myself. It's a strange, beautiful
  place."</p>

  <p>"Do you like the women?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen much of the Sago Lily?"</p>

  <p>"No. I carried her bucket one night&mdash;and saw her only once again.
  I've been with the other women most of the time."</p>

  <p>"It's just as well you didn't run often into Mary. Joe's sick over her. I
  never saw a girl with a face and form to equal hers. There's danger here for
  any man, Shefford. Even for you who think you've turned your back on the
  world! Any of these Mormon women may fall in love with you. They CAN'T love
  their husbands. That's how I figure it. Religion holds them, not love. And
  the peculiar thing is this: they're second, third, or fourth wives, all
  sealed. That means their husbands are old, have picked them out for youth and
  physical charms, have chosen the very opposite to their first wives, and then
  have hidden them here in this lonely hole... Did you ever imagine so terrible
  a thing?"</p>

  <p>"No, Withers, I did not."</p>

  <p>"Maybe that's what depressed you. Anyway, my hunch is worth taking. Be as
  nice as you can, Shefford. Lord knows it would be good for these poor women
  if every last one of them fell in love with you. That won't hurt them so long
  as you keep your head. Savvy? Perhaps I seem rough and coarse to a man of
  your class. Well, that may be. But human nature is human nature. And in this
  strange and beautiful place you might love an Indian girl, let alone the Sago
  Lily. That's all. I sure feel better with that load off my conscience. Hope I
  don't offend."</p>

  <p>"No indeed. I thank you, Withers," replied Shefford, with his hand on the
  trader's shoulder. "You are right to caution me. I seem to be wild&mdash;
  thirsting for adventure&mdash;chasing a gleam. In these unstable days I can't
  answer for my heart. But I can for my honor. These unfortunate women are as
  safe with me as&mdash;as they are with you and Joe."</p>

  <p>Withers uttered a blunt laugh.</p>

  <p>"See here, son, look things square in the eye. Men of violent, lonely,
  toilsome lives store up hunger for the love of woman. Love of a STRANGE
  woman, if you want to put it that way. It's nature. It seems all the
  beautiful young women in Utah are corralled in this valley. When I come over
  here I feel natural, but I'm not happy. I'd like to make love to&mdash;to
  that flower- faced girl. And I'm not ashamed to own it. I've told Molly, my
  wife, and she understands. As for Joe, it's much harder for him. Joe never
  has had a wife or sweetheart. I tell you he's sick, and if I'd stay here a
  month I'd be sick."</p>

  <p>Withers had spoken with fire in his eyes, with grim humor on his lips,
  with uncompromising brutal truth. What he admitted was astounding to
  Shefford, but, once spoken, not at all strange. The trader was a man who
  spoke his inmost thought. And what he said suddenly focused Shefford's mental
  vision clear and whole upon the appalling significance of the tragedy of
  those women, especially of the girl whose life was lonelier, sadder, darker
  than that of the others.</p>

  <p>"Withers, trust me," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"All right. Make the best of a bad job," said the trader, and went off
  about his tasks.</p>

  <p>Shefford and Withers attended the morning service, which was held in the
  school-house. Exclusive of the children every inhabitant of the village was
  there. The women, except the few eldest, were dressed in white and looked
  exceedingly well. Manifestly they had bestowed care upon this Sabbath
  morning's toilet. One thing surely this dress occasion brought out, and it
  was evidence that the Mormon women were not poor, whatever their misfortunes
  might be. Jewelry was not wanting, nor fine lace. And they all wore beautiful
  wild flowers of a kind unknown to Shefford. He received many a bright smile.
  He looked for Mary, hoping to see her face for the first time in the
  daylight, but she sat far forward and did not turn. He saw her graceful white
  neck, the fine lines of her throat, and her colorless cheek. He recognized
  her, yet in the light she seemed a stranger.</p>

  <p>The service began with a short prayer and was followed by the singing of a
  hymn. Nowhere had Shefford heard better music or sweeter voices. How deeply
  they affected him! Had any man ever fallen into a stranger adventure than
  this? He had only to shut his eyes to believe it all a creation of his fancy
  &mdash;the square log cabin with its red mud between the chinks and a roof
  like an Indian hogan&mdash;the old bishop in his black coat, standing
  solemnly, his hand beating time to the tune&mdash;the few old women,
  dignified and stately&mdash;the many young women, fresh and handsome, lifting
  their voices.</p>

  <p>Shefford listened intently to the bishop's sermon. In some respects it was
  the best he had ever heard. In others it was impossible for an intelligent
  man to regard seriously. It was very long, lasting an hour and a half, and
  the parts that were helpful to Shefford came from the experience and wisdom
  of a man who had grown old in the desert. The physical things that had molded
  characters of iron, the obstacles that only strong, patient men could have
  overcome, the making of homes in a wilderness, showed the greatness of this
  alien band of Mormons. Shefford conceded greatness to them. But the strange
  religion&mdash;the narrowing down of the world to the soil of Utah, the
  intimations of prophets on earth who had direct converse with God, the
  austere self-conscious omnipotence of this old bishop&mdash;these were
  matters that Shefford felt he must understand better, and see more favorably,
  if he were not to consider them impossible.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the service, forgetting that his intention had been to
  get the long-waited-for look at Mary in the light of the sun, Shefford
  hurried back to camp and to a secluded spot among the cedars. Strikingly it
  had come to him that the fault he had found in Gentile religion he now found
  in the Mormon religion. An old question returned to haunt him&mdash;were all
  religions the same in blindness? As far as he could see, religion existed to
  uphold the founders of a Church, a creed. The Church of his own kind was a
  place where narrow men and women went to think of their own salvation. They
  did not go there to think of others. And now Shefford's keen mind saw
  something of Mormonism and found it wanting. Bishop Kane was a sincere, good,
  mistaken man. He believed what he preached, but that would not stand logic.
  He taught blindness and mostly it appeared to be directed at the women. Was
  there no religion divorced from power, no religion as good for one man as
  another, no religion in the spirit of brotherly love? Nas Ta Bega's "Bi Nai"
  (brother)&mdash;that was love, if not religion, and perhaps the one and the
  other were the same. Shefford kept in mind an intention to ask Nas Ta Bega
  what he thought of the Mormons.</p>

  <p>Later, when opportunity afforded, he did speak to the Indian. Nas Ta Bega
  threw away his cigarette and made an impressive gesture that conveyed as much
  sorrow as scorn.</p>

  <p>"The first Mormon said God spoke to him and told him to go to a certain
  place and dig. He went there and found the Book of Mormon. It said follow me,
  marry many wives, go into the desert and multiply, send your sons out into
  the world and bring us young women, many young women. And when the first
  Mormon became strong with many followers he said again: Give to me part of
  your labor&mdash;of your cattle and sheep&mdash;of your silver&mdash; that I
  may build me great cathedrals for you to worship in. And I will commune with
  God and make it right and good that you have more wives. That is
  Mormonism."</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, you mean the Mormons are a great and good people blindly
  following a leader?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And the leader builds for himself&mdash;not for them."</p>

  <p>"That is not religion. He has no God but himself."</p>

  <p>"They have no God. They are blind like the Mokis who have the creeping
  growths on their eyes. They have no God they can see and hear and feel, who
  is with them day and night."</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon when Bishop Kane rode through the camp and
  halted on his way to speak to Shefford. He was kind and fatherly. "Young man,
  are you open to faith?" he questioned gravely.</p>

  <p>"I think I am," replied Shefford, thankful he could answer readily.</p>

  <p>"Then come into the fold. You are a lost sheep. 'Away on the desert I
  heard its cry.'... God bless you. Visit me when you ride to Stonebridge."</p>

  <p>He flicked his horse with a cedar branch and trotted away beside the
  trader, and presently the green-choked neck of the valley hid them from view.
  Shefford could not have said that he was glad to be left behind, and yet
  neither was he sorry.</p>

  <p>That Sabbath evening as he sat quietly with Nas Ta Bega, watching the
  sunset gilding the peaks, he was visited by three of the young Mormon women
  &mdash;Ruth, Joan, and Hester. They deliberately sought him and merrily led
  him off to the village and to the evening service of singing and prayer.
  Afterward he was surrounded and made much of. He had been popular before, but
  this was different. When he thoughtfully wended his way campward under the
  quiet stars he realized that the coming of Bishop Kane had made a subtle
  change in the women. That change was at first hard to define, but from every
  point by which he approached it he came to the same conclusion&mdash;the
  bishop had not objected to his presence in the village. The women became
  natural, free, and unrestrained. A dozen or twenty young and attractive women
  thrown much into companionship with one man. He might become a Mormon. The
  idea made him laugh. But upon reflection it was not funny; it sobered him.
  What a situation! He felt instinctively that he ought to fly from this hidden
  valley. But he could not have done it, even had he not been in the trader's
  employ. The thing was provokingly seductive. It was like an Arabian Nights'
  tale. What could these strange, fatally bound women do? Would any one of them
  become involved in sweet toils such as were possible to him? He was no fool.
  Already eyes had flashed and lips had smiled.</p>

  <p>A thousand like thoughts whirled through his mind. And when he had calmed
  down somewhat two things were not lost upon him&mdash;an intricate and
  fascinating situation, with no end to its possibilities, threatened and
  attracted him&mdash;and the certainty that, whatever change the bishop had
  inaugurated, it had made these poor women happier. The latter fact weighed
  more with Shefford than fears for himself. His word was given to Withers. He
  would have felt just the same without having bound himself. Still, in the
  light of the trader's blunt philosophy, and of his own assurance that he was
  no fool, Shefford felt it incumbent upon him to accept a belief that there
  were situations no man could resist without an anchor. The ingenuity of man
  could not have devised a stranger, a more enticing, a more overpoweringly
  fatal situation. Fatal in that it could not be left untried! Shefford gave in
  and clicked his teeth as he let himself go. And suddenly he thought of her
  whom these bitter women called the Sago Lily.</p>

  <p>The regret that had been his returned with thought of her. The saddest
  disillusion of his life, the keenest disappointment, the strangest pain,
  would always be associated with her. He had meant to see her face once, clear
  in the sunlight, so that he could always remember it, and then never go near
  her again. And now it came to him that if he did see much of her these other
  women would find him like the stone wall in the valley. Folly! Perhaps it
  was, but she would be safe, maybe happier. When he decided, it was certain
  that he trembled.</p>

  <p>Then he buried the memory of Fay Larkin.</p>

  <p>Next day Shefford threw himself with all the boy left in him into the work
  and play of the village. He helped the women and made games for the children.
  And he talked or listened. In the early evening he called on Ruth, chatted
  awhile, and went on to see Joan, and from her to another. When the valley
  became shrouded in darkness he went unseen down the path to Mary's lonely
  home.</p>

  <p>She was there, a white shadow against the black.</p>

  <p>When she replied to his greeting her voice seemed full, broken, eager to
  express something that would not come. She was happier to see him than she
  should have been, Shefford thought. He talked, swiftly, eloquently, about
  whatever he believed would interest her. He stayed long, and finally left,
  not having seen her face except in pale starlight and shadow; and the strong
  clasp of her hand remained with him as he went away under the pinyons.</p>

  <p>Days passed swiftly. Joe Lake did not return. The Indian rode in and out
  of camp, watered and guarded the pack-burros and the mustangs. Shefford grew
  strong and active. He made gardens for the women; he cut cords of fire-wood;
  he dammed the brook and made an irrigation ditch; he learned to love these
  fatherless children, and they loved him.</p>

  <p>In the afternoons there was leisure for him and for the women. He had no
  favorites, and let the occasion decide what he should do and with whom he
  should be. They had little parties at the cottages and picnics under the
  cedars. He rode up and down the valley with Ruth, who could ride a horse as
  no other girl he had ever seen. He climbed with Hester. He walked with Joan.
  Mostly he contrived to include several at once in the little excursions,
  though it was not rare for him to be out alone with one.</p>

  <p>It was not a game he was playing. More and more, as he learned to know
  these young women, he liked them better, he pitied them, he was good for
  them. It shamed him, hurt him, somehow, to see how they tried to forget
  something when they were with him. Not improbably a little of it was
  coquetry, as natural as a laugh to any pretty woman. But that was not what
  hurt him. It was to see Ruth or Rebecca, as the case might be, full of life
  and fun, thoroughly enjoying some jest or play, all of a sudden be strangely
  recalled from the wholesome pleasure of a girl to become a deep and somber
  woman. The crimes in the name of religion! How he thought of the blood and
  the ruin laid at the door of religion! He wondered if that were so with Nas
  Ta Bega's religion, and he meant to find out some day. The women he liked
  best he imagined the least religious, and they made less effort to attract
  him.</p>

  <p>Every night in the dark he went to Mary's home and sat with her on the
  porch. He never went inside. For all he knew, his visits were unknown to her
  neighbors. Still, it did not matter to him if they found out. To her he could
  talk as he had never talked to any one. She liberated all his thought and
  fancy. He filled her mind.</p>

  <p>As there had been a change in the other women, so was there in Mary;
  however, it had no relation to the bishop's visit. The time came when
  Shefford could not but see that she lived and dragged through the long day
  for the sake of those few hours in the shadow of the stars with him. She
  seldom spoke. She listened. Wonderful to him&mdash;sometimes she laughed
  &mdash;and it seemed the sound was a ghost of childhood pleasure. When he
  stopped to consider that she might fall in love with him he drove the thought
  from him. When he realized that his folly had become sweet and that the
  sweetness imperiously drew him, he likewise cast off that thought. The
  present was enough. And if he had any treasures of mind and heart he gave
  them to her.</p>

  <p>She never asked him to stay, but she showed that she wanted him to. That
  made it hard to go. Still, he never stayed late. The moment of parting was
  like a break. Her good-by was sweet, low music; it lingered on his ear; it
  bade him come to-morrow night; and it sent him away into the valley to walk
  under the stars, a man fighting against himself.</p>

  <p>One night at parting, as he tried to see her face in the wan glow of a
  clouded moon, he said:</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to find a sago-lily."</p>

  <p>"Have you never seen one?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No." He meant to say something with a double meaning, in reference to her
  face and the name of the flower, but her unconsciousness made him hold his
  tongue. She was wholly unlike the other women.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you where the lilies grow," she said.</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow. Early in the afternoon I'll come to the spring. Then I'll take
  you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning Joe Lake returned and imparted news that was
  perturbing to Shefford. Reports of Shadd had come in to Stonebridge from
  different Indian villages; Joe was not inclined to linger long at the camp,
  and favored taking the trail with the pack-train.</p>

  <p>Shefford discovered that he did not want to leave the valley, and the
  knowledge made him reflective. That morning he did not go into the village,
  and stayed in camp alone. A depression weighed upon him. It was dispelled,
  however, early in the afternoon by the sight of a slender figure in white
  swiftly coming down the path to the spring. He had an appointment with Mary
  to go to see the sago lilies; everything else slipped his mind.</p>

  <p>Mary wore the long black hood that effectually concealed her face. It made
  of her a woman, a Mormon woman, and strangely belied the lithe form and the
  braid of gold hair.</p>

  <p>"Good day," she said, putting down her bucket. "Do you still want to go
  &mdash;to see the lilies?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Shefford, with a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"Can you climb?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go where you go."</p>

  <p>Then she set off under the cedars and Shefford stalked at her side. He was
  aware that Nas Ta Bega watched them walk away. This day, so far, at least,
  Shefford did not feel talkative; and Mary had always been one who mostly
  listened. They came at length to a place where the wall rose in low, smooth
  swells, not steep, but certainly at an angle Shefford would not of his own
  accord have attempted to scale.</p>

  <p>Light, quick, and sure as a mountain-sheep Mary went up the first swell to
  an offset above. Shefford, in amaze and admiration, watched the little
  moccasins as they flashed and held on to the smooth rock.</p>

  <p>When he essayed to follow her he slipped and came to grief. A second
  attempt resulted in like failure. Then he backed away from the wall, to run
  forward fast and up the slope, only to slip, halfway up, and fall again.</p>

  <p>He made light of the incident, but she was solicitous. When he assured her
  he was unhurt she said he had agreed to go where she went.</p>

  <p>"But I'm not a&mdash;a bird," he protested.</p>

  <p>"Take off your boots. Then you can climb. When we get over the wall it'll
  be easy," she said.</p>

  <p>In his stocking-feet he had no great difficulty walking up the first bulge
  of the walls. And from there she led him up the strange waves of wind- worn
  rock. He could not attend to anything save the red, polished rock under him,
  and so saw little. The ascent was longer than he would have imagined, and
  steep enough to make him pant, but at last a huge round summit was
  reached,</p>

  <p>From here he saw down into the valley where the village lay. But for the
  lazy columns of blue smoke curling up from the pinyons the place would have
  seemed uninhabited. The wall on the other side was about level with the one
  upon which he stood. Beyond rose other walls and cliffs, up and up to the
  great towering peaks between which the green-and-black mountain loomed.
  Facing the other way, Shefford had only a restricted view. There were low
  crags and smooth stone ridges, between which were aisles green with cedar and
  pinyon. Shefford's companion headed toward one of these, and when he had
  followed her a few steps he could no longer see down into the valley. The
  Mormon village where she lived was as if it were lost, and when it vanished
  Shefford felt a difference. Scarcely had the thought passed when Mary removed
  the dark hood. Her small head glistened like gold in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>Shefford caught up with her and walked at her side, but could not bring
  himself at once deliberately to look at her. They entered a narrow,
  low-walled lane where cedars and pinyons grew thickly, their fragrance heavy
  in the warm air, and flowers began to show in the grassy patches.</p>

  <p>"This is Indian paint-brush," she said, pointing to little, low, scarlet
  flowers. A gray sage-bush with beautiful purple blossoms she called purple
  sage; another bush with yellow flowers she named buck-brush, and there were
  vermilion cacti and low, flat mounds of lavender daisies which she said had
  no name. A whole mossy bank was covered with lace like green leaves and tiny
  blossoms the color of violets, which she called loco.</p>

  <p>"Loco? Is this what makes the horses go crazy when they eat it?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It is, indeed," she said, laughing.</p>

  <p>When she laughed it was impossible not to look at her. She walked a little
  in advance. Her white cheek and temple seemed framed in the gold of her hair.
  How white her skin! But it was like pearl, faintly veined and flushed. The
  profile, clear-cut and pure, appeared cold, almost stern. He knew now that
  she was singularly beautiful, though he had yet to see her full face.</p>

  <p>They walked on. Quite suddenly the lane opened out between two rounded
  bluffs, and Shefford looked down upon a grander and more awe-inspiring scene
  than ever he had viewed in his dreams.</p>

  <p>What appeared to be a green mountainside sloped endlessly down to a plain,
  and that rolled and billowed away to a boundless region of strangely carved
  rock. The greatness of the scene could not be grasped in a glance. The slope
  was long; the plain not as level as it seemed to be on first sight; here and
  there round, red rocks, isolated and strange, like lonely castles, rose out
  of the green. Beyond the green all the earth seemed naked, showing smooth,
  glistening bones. It was a formidable wall of rock that flung itself up in
  the distance, carved into a thousand canyon and walls and domes and peaks,
  and there was not a straight nor a broken nor a jagged line in all that
  wildness. The color low down was red, dark blue, and purple in the clefts,
  yellow upon the heights, and in the distance rainbow-hued. A land of curves
  and color!</p>

  <p>Shefford uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"That's Utah," said Mary. "I come often to sit here. You see that winding
  blue line. There... That's San Juan Canyon. And the other dark line, that's
  Escalante Canyon. They wind down into this great purple chasm&mdash;'way over
  here to the left&mdash;and that's the Grand Canyon. They say not even the
  Indians have been in there."</p>

  <p>Shefford had nothing to say. The moment was one of subtle and vital
  assimilation. Such places as this to be unknown to men! What strength, what
  wonder, what help, what glory, just to sit there an hour, slowly and
  appallingly to realize! Something came to Shefford from the distance, out of
  the purple canyon and from those dim, wind-worn peaks. He resolved to come
  here to this promontory again and again, alone and in humble spirit, and
  learn to know why he had been silenced, why peace pervaded his soul.</p>

  <p>It was with this emotion upon him that he turned to find his companion
  watching him. Then for the first time he saw her face fully, and was thrilled
  that chance had reserved the privilege for this moment. It was a girl's face
  he saw, flower-like, lovely and pure as a Madonna's, and strangely,
  tragically sad. The eyes were large, dark gray, the color of the sage. They
  were as clear as the air which made distant things close, and yet they seemed
  full of shadows, like a ruffled pool under midnight stars. They disturbed
  him. Her mouth had the sweet curves and redness of youth, but it showed
  bitterness, pain, and repression.</p>

  <p>"Where are the sago-lilies?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Farther down. It's too cold up here for them. Come," she said.</p>

  <p>He followed her down a winding trail&mdash;down and down till the green
  plain rose to blot out the scrawled wall of rock, down into a verdant canyon
  where a brook made swift music over stones, where the air was sultry and hot,
  laden with the fragrant breath of flower and leaf. This was a canyon of
  summer, and it bloomed.</p>

  <p>The girl bent and plucked something from the grass.</p>

  <p>"Here's a white lily," she said. "There are three colors. The yellow and
  pink ones are deeper down in the canyon."</p>

  <p>Shefford took the flower and regarded it with great interest. He had never
  seen such an exquisite thing. It had three large petals, curving cuplike, of
  a whiteness purer than new-fallen snow, and a heart of rich, warm gold. Its
  fragrance was so faint as to be almost indistinguishable, yet of a haunting,
  unforgettable sweetness. And even while he looked at it the petals drooped
  and their whiteness shaded and the gold paled. In a moment the flower was
  wilted.</p>

  <p>"I don't like to pluck the lilies," said Mary. "They die so swiftly."</p>

  <p>Shefford saw the white flowers everywhere in the open, sunny places along
  the brook. They swayed with stately grace in the slow, warm wind. They seemed
  like three-pointed stars shining out of the green. He bent over one with a
  particularly lofty stem, and after a close survey of it he rose to look at
  her face. His action was plainly one of comparison. She laughed and said it
  was foolish for the women to call her the Sago Lily. She had no coquetry; she
  spoke as she would have spoken of the stones at her feet; she did not know
  that she was beautiful. Shefford imagined there was some resemblance in her
  to the lily&mdash;the same whiteness, the same rich gold, and, more striking
  than either, a strange, rare quality of beauty, of life, intangible as
  something fleeting, the spirit that had swiftly faded from the plucked
  flower. Where had the girl been born&mdash;what had her life been? Shefford
  was intensely curious about her. She seemed as different from any other women
  he had known as this rare canyon lily was different from the tame flowers at
  home.</p>

  <p>On the return up the slope she outstripped him. She climbed lightly and
  tirelessly. When he reached her upon the promontory there was a stain of red
  in her cheeks and her expression had changed.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back up over the rocks," she said. "I've not climbed for&mdash;
  for so long."</p>

  <p>"I'll go where you go," he replied.</p>

  <p>Then she was off, and he followed. She took to the curves of the bare
  rocks and climbed. He sensed a spirit released in her. It was so strange, so
  keen, so wonderful to be with her, and when he did catch her he feared to
  speak lest he break this mood. Her eyes grew dark and daring, and often she
  stopped to look away across the wavy sea of stones to something beyond the
  great walls. When they got high the wind blew her hair loose and it flew out,
  a golden stream, with the sun bright upon it. He saw that she changed her
  direction, which had been in line with the two peaks, and now she climbed
  toward the heights. They came to a more difficult ascent, where the stone
  still held to the smooth curves, yet was marked by steep bulges and slants
  and crevices. Here she became a wild thing. She ran, she leaped, she would
  have left him far behind had he not called. Then she appeared to remember him
  and waited.</p>

  <p>Her face had now lost its whiteness; it was flushed, rosy, warm.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;did you&mdash;ever learn&mdash;to run over rocks &mdash;this
  way?" he panted.</p>

  <p>"All my life I've climbed," she said. "Ah! it's so good to be up on the
  walls again&mdash;to feel the wind&mdash;to see!"</p>

  <p>Thereafter he kept close to her, no matter what the effort. He would not
  miss a moment of her, if he could help it. She was wonderful. He imagined she
  must be like an Indian girl, or a savage who loved the lofty places and the
  silence. When she leaped she uttered a strange, low, sweet cry of wildness
  and exultation. Shefford guessed she was a girl freed from her prison,
  forgetting herself, living again youthful hours. Still she did not forget
  him. She waited for him at the bad places, lent him a strong hand, and
  sometimes let it stay long in his clasp. Tireless and agile, sure-footed as a
  goat, fleet and wild she leaped and climbed and ran until Shefford marveled
  at her. This adventure was indeed fulfilment of a dream. Perhaps she might
  lead him to the treasure at the foot of the rainbow. But that thought, sad
  with memory daring forth from its grave, was irrevocably linked with a girl
  who was dead. He could not remember her, in the presence of this wonderful
  creature who was as strange as she was beautiful. When Shefford reached for
  the brown hand stretched forth to help him in a leap, when he felt its strong
  clasp, the youth and vitality and life of it, he had the fear of a man who
  was running towards a precipice and who could not draw back. This was a
  climb, a lark, a wild race to the Mormon girl, bound now in the village, and
  by the very freedom of it she betrayed her bonds. To Shefford it was also a
  wild race, but toward one sure goal he dared not name.</p>

  <p>They went on, and at length, hand in hand, even where no steep step or
  wide fissure gave reason for the clasp. But she seemed unconscious. They were
  nearing the last height, a bare eminence, when she broke from him and ran up
  the smooth stone. When he surmounted it she was standing on the very summit,
  her arms wide, her full breast heaving, her slender body straight as an
  Indian's, her hair flying in the wind and blazing in the sun. She seemed to
  embrace the west, to reach for something afar, to offer herself to the wind
  and distance. Her face was scarlet from the exertion of the climb, and her
  broad brow was moist. Her eyes had the piercing light of an eagle's, though
  now they were dark. Shefford instinctively grasped the essence of this
  strange spirit, primitive and wild. She was not the woman who had met him at
  the spring. She had dropped some side of her with that Mormon hood, and now
  she stood totally strange.</p>

  <p>She belonged up here, he divined. She was a part of that wildness. She
  must have been born and brought up in loneliness, where the wind blew and the
  peaks loomed and silence held dominion. The sinking sun touched the rim of
  the distant wall, and as if in parting regret shone with renewed golden fire.
  And the girl was crowned as with a glory.</p>

  <p>Shefford loved her then. Realizing it, he thought he might have loved her
  before, but that did not matter when he was certain of it now. He trembled a
  little, fearfully, though without regret. Everything pertaining to his desert
  experience had been strange&mdash;this the strangest of all.</p>

  <p>The sun sank swiftly, and instantly there was a change in the golden
  light. Quickly it died out. The girl changed as swiftly. She seemed to
  remember herself, and sat down as if suddenly weary. Shefford went closer and
  seated himself beside her.</p>

  <p>"The sun has set. We must go," she said. But she made no movement.</p>

  <p>"Whenever you are ready," replied he.</p>

  <p>Just as the blaze had died out of her eyes, so the flush faded out of her
  face. The whiteness stole back, and with it the sadness. He had to bite his
  tongue to keep from telling her what he felt, to keep from pouring out a
  thousand questions. But the privilege of having seen her, of having been with
  her when she had forgotten herself&mdash;that he believed was enough. It had
  been wonderful; it had made him love her But it need not add to the tragedy
  of her life, whatever that was. He tried to eliminate himself. And he watched
  her.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were fixed upon the gold-rimmed ramparts of the distant wall in
  the west. Plain it was how she loved that wild upland. And there seemed to be
  some haunting memory of the past in her gaze&mdash;some happy part of life,
  agonizing to think of now.</p>

  <p>"We must go," she said, and rose.</p>

  <p>Shefford rose to accompany her. She looked at him, and her haunting eyes
  seemed to want him to know that he had helped her to forget the present, to
  remember girlhood, and that somehow she would always associate a wonderful
  happy afternoon with him. He divined that her silence then was a Mormon seal
  on lips.</p>

  <p>"Mary, this has been the happiest, the best, the most revealing day of my
  life," he said, simply.</p>

  <p>Swiftly, as if startled, she turned and faced down the slope. At the top
  of the wall above the village she put on the dark hood, and with it that
  somber something which was Mormon.</p>

  <p>Twilight had descended into the valley, and shadows were so thick Shefford
  had difficulty in finding Mary's bucket. He filled it at the spring, and made
  offer to carry it home for her, which she declined.</p>

  <p>"You'll come to-night&mdash;later?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, hurriedly promising. Then he watched her white form
  slowly glide down the path to disappear in the shadows.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega and Joe were busy at the camp-fire. Shefford joined them. This
  night he was uncommunicative. Joe peered curiously at him in the flare of the
  blaze. Later, after the meal, when Shefford appeared restless and strode to
  and fro, Joe spoke up gruffly:</p>

  <p>"Better hang round camp to-night."</p>

  <p>Shefford heard, but did not heed. Nevertheless, the purport of the remark,
  which was either jealousy or admonition, haunted him with the possibility of
  its meaning.</p>

  <p>He walked away from the camp-fire, under the dark pinyons, out into the
  starry open; and every step was hard to take, unless it pointed toward the
  home of the girl whose beauty and sadness and mystery had bewitched him.
  After what seemed hours he took the well-known path toward her cabin, and
  then every step seemed lighter. He divined he was rushing to some fate
  &mdash;he knew not what.</p>

  <p>The porch was in shadow. He peered in vain for the white form against the
  dark background. In the silence he seemed to hear his heart-beats thick and
  muffled.</p>

  <p>Some distance down the path he heard the sound of hoofs. Withdrawing into
  the gloom of a cedar, he watched. Soon he made out moving horses with riders.
  They filed past him to the number of half a score. Like a flash of fire the
  truth burned him. Mormons come for one of those mysterious night visits to
  sealed wives!</p>

  <p>Shefford stalked far down the valley, into the lonely silence and the
  night shadows under the walls.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII.</a> &mdash; THE HOGAN OF NAS TA BEGA</h2>

  <p class="first">THE home of Nas Ta Bega lay far up the cedared slope, with
  the craggy yellow cliffs and the black canyon and the pine-fringed top of
  Navajo Mountain behind, and to the fore the vast, rolling descent of cedar
  groves and sage flats and sandy washes. No dim, dark range made bold outline
  along the horizon; the stretch of gray and purple and green extended to the
  blue line of sky.</p>

  <p>Down the length of one sage level Shefford saw a long lane where the brush
  and the grass had been beaten flat. This, the Navajo said, was a track where
  the young braves had raced their mustangs and had striven for supremacy
  before the eyes of maidens and the old people of the tribe.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, did you ever race here?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I am a chief by birth. But I was stolen from my home, and now I cannot
  ride well enough to race the braves of my tribe," the Indian replied,
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>In another place Joe Lake halted his horse and called Shefford's attention
  to a big yellow rock lying along the trail. And then he spoke in Navajo to
  the Indian.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of this stone&mdash;Isende Aha," said Joe, after Nas Ta Bega
  had spoken. "Get down, and let's see." Shefford dismounted, but the Indian
  kept his seat in the saddle.</p>

  <p>Joe placed a big hand on the stone and tried to move it. According to
  Shefford's eye measurement the stone was nearly oval, perhaps three feet
  high, by a little over two in width. Joe threw off his sombrero, took a deep
  breath, and, bending over, clasped the stone in his arms. He was an
  exceedingly heavy and powerful man, and it was plain to Shefford that he
  meant to lift the stone if that were possible. Joe's broad shoulders
  strained, flattened; his arms bulged, his joints cracked, his neck corded,
  and his face turned black. By gigantic effort he lifted the stone and moved
  it about six inches. Then as he released his hold he fell, and when he sat up
  his face was wet with sweat.</p>

  <p>"Try it," he said to Shefford, with his lazy smile. "See if you can heave
  it."</p>

  <p>Shefford was strong, and there had been a time when he took pride in his
  strength. Something in Joe's supreme effort and in the gloom of the Indian's
  eyes made Shefford curious about this stone. He bent over and grasped it as
  Joe had done. He braced himself and lifted with all his power, until a red
  blur obscured his sight and shooting stars seemed to explode in his head. But
  he could not even stir the stone.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, maybe you'll be able to heft it some day," observed Joe. Then
  he pointed to the stone and addressed Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>The Indian shook his head and spoke for a moment.</p>

  <p>"This is the Isende Aha of the Navajos," explained Joe. "The young braves
  are always trying to carry this stone. As soon as one of them can carry it he
  is a man. He who carries it farthest is the biggest man. And just so soon as
  any Indian can no longer lift it he is old. Nas Ta Bega says the stone has
  been carried two miles in his lifetime. His own father carried it the length
  of six steps."</p>

  <p>"Well! It's plain to me that I am not a man," said Shefford, "or else I am
  old."</p>

  <p>Joe Lake drawled his lazy laugh and, mounting, rode up the trail. But
  Shefford lingered beside the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai," said Nas Ta Bega, "I am a chief of my tribe, but I have never
  been a man. I never lifted that stone. See what the pale-face education has
  done for the Indian!"</p>

  <p>The Navajo's bitterness made Shefford thoughtful. Could greater injury be
  done to man than this&mdash;to rob him of his heritage of strength?</p>

  <p>Joe drove the bobbing pack-train of burros into the cedars where the smoke
  of the hogans curled upward, and soon the whistling of mustangs, the barking
  of dogs, the bleating of sheep, told of his reception. And presently Shefford
  was in the midst of an animated scene. Great, woolly, fierce dogs, like
  wolves, ran out to meet the visitors. Sheep and goats were everywhere, and
  little lambs scarcely able to walk, with others frisky and frolicsome. There
  were pure-white lambs, and some that appeared to be painted, and some so
  beautiful with their fleecy white all except black faces or ears or tails or
  feet. They ran right under Nack-yal's legs and bumped against Shefford, and
  kept bleating their thin-piped welcome. Under the cedars surrounding the
  several hogans were mustangs that took Shefford's eye. He saw an iron-gray
  with white mane and tail sweeping to the ground; and a fiery black, wilder
  than any other beast he had ever seen; and a pinto as wonderfully painted as
  the little lambs; and, most striking of all, a pure, cream-colored mustang
  with grace and fine lines and beautiful mane and tail, and, strange to see,
  eyes as blue as azure. This albino mustang came right up to Shefford, an
  action in singular contrast with that of the others, and showed a tame and
  friendly spirit toward him and Nack-yal. Indeed, Shefford had reason to feel
  ashamed of Nack-yal's temper or jealousy.</p>

  <p>The first Indians to put in an appearance were a flock of children, half
  naked, with tangled manes of raven-black hair and skin like gold bronze. They
  appeared bold and shy by turns. Then a little, sinewy man, old and beaten and
  gray, came out of the principal hogan. He wore a blanket round his bent
  shoulders. His name was Hosteen Doetin, and it meant gentle man. His fine,
  old, wrinkled face lighted with a smile of kindly interest. His squaw
  followed him, and she was as venerable as he. Shefford caught a glimpse of
  the shy, dark Glen Naspa, Nas Ta Bega's sister, but she did not come out.
  Other Indians appeared, coming from adjacent hogans.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega turned the mustangs loose among those Shefford had noticed,
  and presently there rose a snorting, whistling, kicking, plunging melee. A
  cloud of dust hid them, and then a thudding of swift hoofs told of a run
  through the cedars. Joe Lake began picking over stacks of goat-skins and bags
  of wool that were piled against the hogan.</p>

  <p>"Reckon we'll have one grand job packing out this load," he growled. "It's
  not so heavy, but awkward to pack."</p>

  <p>It developed, presently, from talk with the old Navajo, that this pile was
  only a half of the load to be packed to Kayenta, and the other half was round
  the corner of the mountain in the camp of Piutes. Hosteen Doetin said he
  would send to the camp and have the Piutes bring their share over. The
  suggestion suited Joe, who wanted to save his burros as much as possible.
  Accordingly, a messenger was despatched to the Piute camp. And Shefford, with
  time on his hands and poignant memory to combat, decided to recall his keen
  interest in the Navajo, and learn, if possible, what the Indian's life was
  like. What would a day of his natural life be?</p>

  <p>In the gray of dawn, when the hush of the desert night still lay deep over
  the land, the Navajo stirred in his blanket and began to chant to the morning
  light. It began very soft and low, a strange, broken murmur, like the music
  of a brook, and as it swelled that weird and mournful tone was slowly lost in
  one of hope and joy. The Indian's soul was coming out of night, blackness,
  the sleep that resembled death, into the day, the light that was life.</p>

  <p>Then he stood in the door of his hogan, his blanket around him, and faced
  the east.</p>

  <p>Night was lifting out of the clefts and ravines; the rolling cedar ridges
  and the sage flats were softly gray, with thin veils like smoke mysteriously
  rising and vanishing; the colorless rocks were changing. A long, horizon-wide
  gleam of light, rosiest in the center, lay low down in the east and
  momentarily brightened. One by one the stars in the deep-blue sky paled and
  went out and the blue dome changed and lightened. Night had vanished on
  invisible wings and silence broke to the music of a mockingbird. The rose in
  the east deepened; a wisp of cloud turned gold; dim distant mountains showed
  dark against the red; and low down in a notch a rim of fire appeared. Over
  the soft ridges and valleys crept a wondrous transfiguration. It was as if
  every blade of grass, every leaf of sage, every twig of cedar, the flowers,
  the trees, the rocks came to life at sight of the sun. The red disk rose, and
  a golden fire burned over the glowing face of that lonely waste.</p>

  <p>The Navajo, dark, stately, inscrutable, faced the sun&mdash;his god. This
  was his Great Spirit. The desert was his mother, but the sun was his life. To
  the keeper of the winds and rains, to the master of light, to the maker of
  fire, to the giver of life the Navajo sent up his prayer:</p>

  <p>Of all the good things of the Earth let me always have plenty. Of all the
  beautiful things of the Earth let me always have plenty. Peacefully let my
  horses go and peacefully let my sheep go. God of the Heavens, give me many
  sheep and horses. God of the Heavens, help me to talk straight. Goddess of
  the Earth, my Mother, let me walk straight. Now all is well, now all is well,
  now all is well, now all is well.</p>

  <p>Hope and faith were his.</p>

  <p>A chief would be born to save the vanishing tribe of Navajos. A bride
  would rise from a wind&mdash;kiss of the lilies in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>He drank from the clear, cold spring bubbling from under mossy rocks. He
  went into the cedars, and the tracks in the trails told him of the visitors
  of night. His mustangs whistled to him from the ridge-tops, standing clear
  with heads up and manes flying, and then trooped down through the sage. The
  shepherd- dogs, guardians of the flocks, barked him a welcome, and the sheep
  bleated and the lambs pattered round him.</p>

  <p>In the hogan by the warm, red fire his women baked his bread and cooked
  his meat. And he satisfied his hunger. Then he took choice meat to the hogan
  of a sick relative, and joined in the song and the dance and the prayer that
  drove away the evil spirit of illness. Down in the valley, in a sandy, sunny
  place, was his corn-field, and here he turned in the water from the ditch,
  and worked awhile, and went his contented way.</p>

  <p>He loved his people, his women, and his children. To his son he said: "Be
  bold and brave. Grow like the pine. Work and ride and play that you may be
  strong. Talk straight. Love your brother. Give half to your friend. Honor
  your mother that you may honor your wife. Pray and listen to your gods."</p>

  <p>Then with his gun and his mustang he climbed the slope of the mountain. He
  loved the solitude, but he was never alone. There were voices on the wind and
  steps on his trail. The lofty pine, the lichened rock, the tiny bluebell, the
  seared crag&mdash;all whispered their secrets. For him their spirits spoke.
  In the morning light Old Stone Face, the mountain, was a red god calling him
  to the chase. He was a brother of the eagle, at home on the heights where the
  winds swept and the earth lay revealed below.</p>

  <p>In the golden afternoon, with the warm sun on his back and the blue canyon
  at his feet, he knew the joy of doing nothing. He did not need rest, for he
  was never tired. The sage-sweet breath of the open was thick in his nostrils,
  the silence that had so many whisperings was all about him, the loneliness of
  the wild was his. His falcon eye saw mustang and sheep, the puff of dust down
  on the cedar level, the Indian riding on a distant ridge, the gray walls, and
  the blue clefts. Here was home, still free, still wild, still untainted. He
  saw with the eyes of his ancestors. He felt them around him. They had gone
  into the elements from which their voices came on the wind. They were the
  watchers on his trails.</p>

  <p>At sunset he faced the west, and this was his prayer:</p>

  <p>Great Spirit, God of my Fathers, Keep my horses in the night. Keep my
  sheep in the night. Keep my family in the night. Let me wake to the day. Let
  me be worthy of the light. Now all is well, now all is well, Now all is well,
  now all is well.</p>

  <p>And he watched the sun go down and the gold sink from the peaks and the
  red die out of the west and the gray shadows creep out of the canyon to meet
  the twilight and the slow, silent, mysterious approach of night with its gift
  of stars.</p>

  <p>Night fell. The white stars blinked. The wind sighed in the cedars. The
  sheep bleated. The shepherd-dogs bayed the mourning coyotes. And the Indian
  lay down in his blankets with his dark face tranquil in the starlight. All
  was well in his lonely world. Phantoms hovered, illness lingered, injury and
  pain and death were there, the shadow of a strange white hand flitted across
  the face of the moon&mdash;but now all was well&mdash;the Navajo had prayed
  to the god of his Fathers. Now all was well!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">AND this, thought Shefford in revolt, was what the white man
  had killed in the Indian tribes, was reaching out now to kill in this wild
  remnant of the Navajos. The padre, the trapper, the trader, the prospector,
  and the missionary&mdash;so the white man had come, some of him good, no
  doubt, but more of him evil; and the young brave learned a thirst that could
  never be quenched at the cold, sweet spring of his forefathers, and the young
  maiden burned with a fever in her blood, and lost the sweet, strange, wild
  fancies of her tribe.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">JOE LAKE came to Shefford and said, "Withers told me you had
  a mix-up with a missionary at Red Lake."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I regret to say," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"About Glen Naspa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Nas Ta Bega's sister."</p>

  <p>"Withers just mentioned it. Who was the missionary?"</p>

  <p>"Willetts, so Presbrey, the trader, said."</p>

  <p>"What'd he look like?"</p>

  <p>Shefford recalled the smooth, brown face, the dark eyes, the weak chin,
  the mild expression, and the soft, lax figure of the missionary.</p>

  <p>"Can't tell by what you said," went on Joe. "But I'll bet a peso to a
  horse-hair that's the fellow who's been here. Old Hosteen Doetin just told
  me. First visits he ever had from the priest with the long gown. That's what
  he called the missionary. These old fellows will never forget what's come
  down from father to son about the Spanish padres. Well, anyway, Willetts has
  been here twice after Glen Naspa. The old chap is impressed, but he doesn't
  want to let the girl go. I'm inclined to think Glen Naspa would as lief go as
  stay. She may be a Navajo, but she's a girl. She won't talk much."</p>

  <p>"Where's Nas Ta Bega?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"He rode off somewhere yesterday. Perhaps to the Piute camp. These Indians
  are slow. They may take a week to pack that load over here. But if Nas Ta
  Bega or some one doesn't come with a message to-day I'll ride over there
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Joe, what do you think about this missionary?" queried Shefford,
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Reckon there's not much to think, unless you see him or find out
  something. I heard of Willetts before Withers spoke of him. He's friendly
  with Mormons. I understand he's worked for Mormon interests, someway or
  other. That's on the quiet. Savvy? This matter of him coming after Glen
  Naspa, reckon that's all right. The missionaries all go after the young
  people. What'd be the use to try to convert the old Indians? No, the
  missionary's work is to educate the Indian, and, of course, the younger he is
  the better."</p>

  <p>"You approve of the missionary?"</p>

  <p>"Shefford, if you understood a Mormon you wouldn't ask that. Did you ever
  read or hear of Jacob Hamblin?... Well, he was a Mormon missionary among the
  Navajos. The Navajos were as fierce as Apaches till Hamblin worked among
  them. He made them friendly to the white man."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't prove he made converts of them," replied Shefford, still
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"No. For the matter of that, Hamblin let religion alone. He made presents,
  then traded with them, then taught them useful knowledge. Mormon or not,
  Shefford, I'll admit this: a good man, strong with his body, and learned in
  ways with his hands, with some knowledge of medicine, can better the
  condition of these Indians. But just as soon as he begins to preach his
  religion, then his influence wanes. That's natural. These heathen have their
  ideals, their gods."</p>

  <p>"Which the white man should leave them!" replied Shefford, feelingly.</p>

  <p>"That's a matter of opinion. But don't let's argue... Willetts is after
  Glen Naspa. And if I know Indian girls he'll persuade her to go to his
  school."</p>

  <p>"Persuade her!" Then Shefford broke off and related the incident that had
  occurred at Red Lake.</p>

  <p>"Reckon any means justifies the end," replied Joe, imperturbably. "Let him
  talk love to her or rope her or beat her, so long as he makes a Christian of
  her."</p>

  <p>Shefford felt a hot flush and had difficulty in controlling himself. From
  this single point of view the Mormon was impossible to reason with.</p>

  <p>"That, too, is a matter of opinion. We won't discuss it," continued
  Shefford. "But&mdash;if old Hosteen Doetin objects to the girl leaving, and
  if Nas Ta Bega does the same, won't that end the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Reckon not. The end of the matter is Glen Naspa. If she wants to go
  she'll go."</p>

  <p>Shefford thought best to drop the discussion. For the first time he had
  occasion to be repelled by something in this kind and genial Mormon, and he
  wanted to forget it. Just as he had never talked about men to the sealed
  wives in the hidden valley, so he could not talk of women to Joe Lake.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega did not return that day, but, next morning a messenger came
  calling Lake to the Piute camp. Shefford spent the morning high on the slope,
  learning more with every hour in the silence and loneliness, that he was
  stronger of soul than he had dared to hope, and that the added pain which had
  come to him could be borne.</p>

  <p>Upon his return toward camp, in the cedar grove, he caught sight of Glen
  Naspa with a white man. They did not see him. When Shefford recognized
  Willetts an embarrassment as well as an instinct made him halt and step into
  a bushy, low-branched cedar. It was not his intention to spy on them. He
  merely wanted to avoid a meeting. But the missionary's hand on the girl's
  arm, and her up- lifted head, her pretty face, strange, intent, troubled,
  struck Shefford with an unusual and irresistible curiosity. Willetts was
  talking earnestly; Glen Naspa was listening intently. Shefford watched long
  enough to see that the girl loved the missionary, and that he reciprocated or
  was pretending. His manner scarcely savored of pretense, Shefford concluded,
  as he slipped away under the trees.</p>

  <p>He did not go at once into camp. He felt troubled, and wished that he had
  not encountered the two. His duty in the matter, of course, was to tell Nas
  Ta Bega what he had seen. Upon reflection Shefford decided to give the
  missionary the benefit of a doubt; and if he really cared for the Indian
  girl, and admitted or betrayed it, to think all the better of him for the
  fact. Glen Naspa was certainly pretty enough, and probably lovable enough, to
  please any lonely man in this desert. The pain and the yearning in Shefford's
  heart made him lenient. He had to fight himself&mdash;not to forget, for that
  was impossible&mdash;but to keep rational and sane when a white flower-like
  face haunted him and a voice called.</p>

  <p>The cracking of hard hoofs on stones caused him to turn toward camp, and
  as he emerged from the cedar grove he saw three Indian horsemen ride into the
  cleared space before the hogans. They were superbly mounted and well armed,
  and impressed him as being different from Navajos. Perhaps they were Piutes.
  They dismounted and led the mustangs down to the pool below the spring.
  Shefford saw another mustang, standing bridle down and carrying a pack behind
  the saddle. Some squaws with children hanging behind their skirts were
  standing at the door of Hosteen Doetin's hogan. Shefford glanced in to see
  Glen Naspa, pale, quiet, almost sullen. Willetts stood with his hands spread.
  The old Navajo's seamed face worked convulsively as he tried to lift his bent
  form to some semblance of dignity, and his voice rolled out, sonorously: "Me
  no savvy Jesus Christ! Me hungry!... Me no eat Jesus Christ!"</p>

  <p>Shefford drew back as if he had received a blow. That had been Hosteen
  Doetin's reply to the importunities of the missionary. The old Navajo could
  work no longer. His sons were gone. His squaw was worn out. He had no one
  save Glen Naspa to help him. She was young, strong. He was hungry. What was
  the white man's religion to him?</p>

  <p>With long, swift stride Shefford entered the hogan. Willetts, seeing him,
  did not look so mild as Shefford had him pictured in memory, nor did he
  appear surprised. Shefford touched Hosteen Doetin's shoulder and said, "Tell
  me."</p>

  <p>The aged Navajo lifted a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>"Me no savvy Jesus Christ! Me hungry!... Me no eat Jesus Christ!"</p>

  <p>Shefford then made signs that indicated the missionary's intention to take
  the girl away. "Him come&mdash;big talk&mdash;Jesus&mdash;all Jesus... Me no
  want Glen Naspa go," replied the Indian.</p>

  <p>Shefford turned to the missionary.</p>

  <p>"Willetts, is he a relative of the girl?"</p>

  <p>"There's some blood tie, I don't know what. But it's not close," replied
  Willetts.</p>

  <p>"Then don't you think you'd better wait till Nas Ta Bega returns? He's her
  brother."</p>

  <p>"What for?" demanded Willetts. "That Indian may be gone a week. She's
  willing to accompany the missionary."</p>

  <p>Shefford looked at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Glen Naspa, do you want to go?"</p>

  <p>She was shy, ashamed, and silent, but manifestly willing to accompany the
  missionary. Shefford pondered a moment. How he hoped Nas Ta Bega would come
  back! It was thought of the Indian that made Shefford stubborn. What his
  stand ought to be was hard to define, unless he answered to impulse; and here
  in the wilds he had become imbued with the idea that his impulses and
  instincts were no longer false.</p>

  <p>"Willetts, what do you want with the girl?" queried Shefford, coolly, and
  at the question he seemed to find himself. He peered deliberately and
  searchingly into the other's face. The missionary's gaze shifted and a tinge
  of red crept up from under his collar.</p>

  <p>"Absurd thing to ask a missionary!" he burst out, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Do you care for Glen Naspa?"</p>

  <p>"I care as God's disciple&mdash;who cares to save the soul of heathen," he
  replied, with the lofty tone of prayer.</p>

  <p>"Has Glen Naspa no&mdash;no other interest in you&mdash;except to be
  taught religion?"</p>

  <p>The missionary's face flamed, and his violent tremor showed that under his
  exterior there was a different man.</p>

  <p>"What right have you to question me?" he demanded. "You're an adventurer
  &mdash;an outcast. I've my duty here. I'm a missionary with Church and state
  and government behind me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm an outcast," replied Shefford, bitterly. "And you may be all you
  say. But we're alone now out here on the desert. And this girl's brother is
  absent. You haven't answered me yet... Is there anything between you and Glen
  Naspa except religion?"</p>

  <p>"No, you insulting beggar?"</p>

  <p>Shefford had forced the reply that he had expected and which damned the
  missionary beyond any consideration.</p>

  <p>"Willetts, you are a liar!" said Shefford, steadily.</p>

  <p>"And what are you?" cried Willetts, in shrill fury. "I've heard all about
  you. Heretic! Atheist! Driven from your Church! Hated and scorned for your
  blasphemy!"</p>

  <p>Then he gave way to ungovernable rage, and cursed Shefford as a religious
  fanatic might have cursed the most debased sinners. Shefford heard with the
  blood beating, strangling the pulse in his ears. Somehow this missionary had
  learned his secret&mdash;most likely from the Mormons in Stonebridge. And the
  terms of disgrace were coals of fire upon Shefford's head. Strangely,
  however, he did not bow to them, as had been his humble act in the past, when
  his calumniators had arraigned and flayed him. Passion burned in him now, for
  the first time in his life, made a tiger of him. And these raw emotions, new
  to him, were difficult to control.</p>

  <p>"You can't take the girl," he replied, when the other had ceased. "Not
  without her brother's consent."</p>

  <p>"I will take her!"</p>

  <p>Shefford threw him out of the hogan and strode after him. Willetts had
  stumbled. When he straightened up he was white and shaken. He groped for the
  bridle of his horse while keeping his eyes upon Shefford, and when he found
  it he whirled quickly, mounted, and rode off. Shefford saw him halt a moment
  under the cedars to speak with the three strange Indians, and then he
  galloped away. It came to Shefford then that he had been unconscious of the
  last strained moment of that encounter. He seemed all cold, tight, locked,
  and was amazed to find his hand on his gun. Verily the wild environment had
  liberated strange instincts and impulses, which he had answered. That he had
  no regrets proved how he had changed.</p>

  <p>Shefford heard the old woman scolding. Peering into the hogan, he saw Glen
  Naspa flounce sullenly down, for all the world like any other thwarted girl.
  Hosteen Doetin came out and pointed down the slope at the departing
  missionary.</p>

  <p>"Heap talk Jesus&mdash;all talk&mdash;all Jesus!" he exclaimed,
  contemptuously. Then he gave Shefford a hard rap on the chest. "Small talk
  &mdash;heap man!"</p>

  <p>The matter appeared to be adjusted for the present. But Shefford felt that
  he had made a bitter enemy, and perhaps a powerful one.</p>

  <p>He prepared and ate his supper alone that evening, for Joe Lake and Nas Ta
  Bega did not put in an appearance. He observed that the three strange
  Indians, whom he took for Piutes, kept to themselves, and, so far as he knew,
  had no intercourse with any one at the camp. This would not have seemed
  unusual, considering the taciturn habit of Indians, had he not remembered
  seeing Willetts speak to the trio. What had he to do with them? Shefford was
  considering the situation with vague doubts when, to his relief, the three
  strangers rode off into the twilight. Then he went to bed.</p>

  <p>He was awakened by violence. It was the gray hour before dawn. Dark forms
  knelt over him. A cloth pressed down hard over his mouth: Strong hands bound
  it while other strong hands held him. He could not cry out. He could not
  struggle. A heavy weight, evidently a man, held down his feet. Then he was
  rolled over, securely bound, and carried, to be thrown like a sack over the
  back of a horse.</p>

  <p>All this happened so swiftly as to be bewildering. He was too astounded to
  be frightened. As he hung head downward he saw the legs of a horse and a dim
  trail. A stirrup swung to and fro, hitting him in the face. He began to feel
  exceedingly uncomfortable, with a rush of blood to his head, and cramps in
  his arms and legs. This kept on and grew worse for what seemed a long time.
  Then the horse was stopped and a rude hand tumbled him to the ground. Again
  he was rolled over on his face. Strong fingers plucked at his clothes, and he
  believed he was being searched. His captors were as silent as if they had
  been dumb. He felt when they took his pocketbook and his knife and all that
  he had. Then they cut, tore, and stripped off all his clothing. He was
  lifted, carried a few steps, and dropped upon what seemed a soft, low mound,
  and left lying there, still tied and naked. Shefford heard the rustle of sage
  and the dull thud of hoofs as his assailants went away.</p>

  <p>His first sensation was one of immeasurable relief. He had not been
  murdered. Robbery was nothing. And though roughly handled, he had not been
  hurt. He associated the assault with the three strange visitors of the
  preceding day. Still, he had no proof of that. Not the slightest clue
  remained to help him ascertain who had attacked him.</p>

  <p>It might have been a short while or a long one, his mind was so filled
  with growing conjectures, but a time came when he felt cold. As he lay face
  down, only his back felt cold at first. He was grateful that he had not been
  thrown upon the rocks. The ground under him appeared soft, spongy, and gave
  somewhat as he breathed. He had really sunk down a little in this pile of
  soft earth. The day was not far off, as he could tell by the brightening of
  the gray. He began to suffer with the cold, and then slowly he seemed to
  freeze and grow numb. In an effort to roll over upon his back he discovered
  that his position, or his being bound, or the numbness of his muscles was
  responsible for the fact that he could not move. Here was a predicament. It
  began to look serious. What would a few hours of the powerful sun do to his
  uncovered skin? Somebody would trail and find him: still, he might not be
  found soon.</p>

  <p>He saw the sky lighten, turn rosy and then gold. The sun shone upon him,
  but some time elapsed before he felt its warmth. All of a sudden a pain, like
  a sting, shot through his shoulder. He could not see what caused it; probably
  a bee. Then he felt another upon his leg, and about simultaneously with it a
  tiny, fiery stab in his side. A sickening sensation pervaded his body, slowly
  moving, as if poison had entered the blood of his veins. Then a puncture, as
  from a hot wire, entered the skin of his breast. Unmistakably it was a bite.
  By dint of great effort he twisted his head to see a big red ant on his
  breast. Then he heard a faint sound, so exceedingly faint that he could not
  tell what it was like. But presently his strained ears detected a low, swift,
  rustling, creeping sound, like the slipping rattle of an infinite number of
  tiny bits of moving gravel. Then it was a sound like the seeping of
  wind-blown sand. Several hot bites occurred at once. And then with his head
  twisted he saw a red stream of ants pour out of the mound and spill over his
  quivering flesh.</p>

  <p>In an instant he realized his position. He had been dropped intentionally
  upon an ant-heap, which had sunk with his weight, wedging him between the
  crusts. At the mercy of those terrible desert ants! A frantic effort to roll
  out proved futile, as did another and another. His violent muscular
  contractions infuriated the ants, and in an instant he was writhing in pain
  so horrible and so unendurable that he nearly fainted. But he was too strong
  to faint suddenly. A bath of vitriol, a stripping of his skin and red embers
  of fire thrown upon raw flesh, could not have equaled this. There was fury in
  the bites and poison in the fangs of these ants. Was this an Indian's brutal
  trick or was it the missionary's revenge? Shefford realized that it would
  kill him soon. He sweat what seemed blood, although perhaps the blood came
  from the bites. A strange, hollow, buzzing roar filled his ears, and it must
  have been the pouring of the angry ants from their mound.</p>

  <p>Then followed a time that was hell&mdash;worse than fire, for fire would
  have given merciful death&mdash;agony under which his physical being began
  spasmodically to jerk and retch&mdash;and his eyeballs turned and his breast
  caved in.</p>

  <p>A cry rang through the roar in his ears. "Bi Nai! Bi Nai!"</p>

  <p>His fading sight seemed to shade round the dark face of Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>Then powerful hands dragged him from the mound, through the grass and
  sage, rolled him over and over, and brushed his burning skin with strong,
  swift sweep.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">IX.</a> &mdash; IN THE DESERT CRUCIBLE</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT hard experience was but the beginning of many cruel
  trials for John Shefford.</p>

  <p>He never knew who his assailants were, nor their motive other than
  robbery; and they had gotten little, for they had not found the large sum of
  money sewed in the lining of his coat. Joe Lake declared it was Shadd's work,
  and the Mormon showed the stern nature that lay hidden under his mild manner.
  Nas Ta Bega shook his head and would not tell what he thought. But a somber
  fire burned in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The three started with a heavily laden pack-train and went down the
  mountain slope into West Canyon. The second day they were shot at from the
  rim of the walls. Lake was wounded, hindering the swift flight necessary to
  escape deeper into the canyon. Here they hid for days, while the Mormon
  recovered and the Indian took stealthy trips to try to locate the enemy. Lack
  of water and grass for the burros drove them on. They climbed out of a side
  canyon, losing several burros on a rough trail, and had proceeded to within
  half a day's journey of Red Lake when they were attacked while making camp in
  a cedar grove. Shefford sustained an exceedingly painful injury to his leg,
  but, fortunately, the bullet went through without breaking a bone. With that
  burning pain there came to Shefford the meaning of fight, and his rifle grew
  hot in his hands. Night alone saved the trio from certain fatality. Under the
  cover of darkness the Indian helped Shefford to escape. Joe Lake looked out
  for himself. The pack- train was lost, and the mustangs, except Nack-yal.</p>

  <p>Shefford learned what it meant to lie out at night, listening for pursuit,
  cold to his marrow, sick with dread, and enduring frightful pain from a
  ragged bullet-hole. Next day the Indian led him down into the red basin,
  where the sun shone hot and the sand reflected the heat. They had no water. A
  wind arose and the valley became a place of flying sand. Through a heavy,
  stifling pall Nas Ta Bega somehow got Shefford to the trading-post at Red
  Lake. Presbrey attended to Shefford's injury and made him comfortable. Next
  day Joe Lake limped in, surly and somber, with the news that Shadd and eight
  or ten of his outlaw gang had gotten away with the pack-train.</p>

  <p>In short time Shefford was able to ride, and with his companions went over
  the pass to Kayenta. Withers already knew of his loss, and all he said was
  that he hoped to meet Shadd some day.</p>

  <p>Shefford showed a reluctance to go again to the hidden village in the
  silent canyon with the rounded walls. The trader appeared surprised, but did
  not press the point. And Shefford meant sooner or later to tell him, yet
  never quite reached the point. The early summer brought more work for the
  little post, and Shefford toiled with the others. He liked the outdoor tasks,
  and at night was grateful that he was too tired to think. Then followed trips
  to Durango and Bluff and Monticello. He rode fifty miles a day for many days.
  He knew how a man fares who packs light and rides far and fast. When the
  Indian was with him he got along well, but Nas Ta Bega would not go near the
  towns. Thus many mishaps were Shefford's fortune.</p>

  <p>Many and many a mile he trailed his mustang, for Nack-yal never forgot the
  Sagi, and always headed for it when he broke his hobbles. Shefford
  accompanied an Indian teamster in to Durango with a wagon and four wild
  mustangs. Upon the return, with a heavy load of supplies, accident put
  Shefford in charge of the outfit. In despair he had to face the hardest task
  that could have been given him&mdash;to take care of a crippled Indian,
  catch, water, feed, harness, and drive four wild mustangs that did not know
  him and tried to kill him at every turn, and to get that precious load of
  supplies home to Kayenta. That he accomplished it proved to hint the
  possibilities of a man, for both endurance and patience. From that time he
  never gave up in the front of any duty.</p>

  <p>In the absence of an available Indian he rode to Durango and back in
  record time. Upon one occasion he was lost in a canyon for days, with no food
  and little water. Upon another he went through a sand-storm in the open
  desert, facing it for forty miles and keeping to the trail; When he rode in
  to Kayenta that night the trader, in grim praise, said there was no worse to
  endure. At Monticello Shefford stood off a band of desperadoes, and this time
  Shefford experienced a strange, sickening shock in the wounding of a man.
  Later he had other fights, but in none of them did he know whether or not he
  had shed blood.</p>

  <p>The heat of midsummer came, when the blistering sun shone, and a hot blast
  blew across the sand, and the furious storms made floods in the washes. Day
  and night Shefford was always in the open, and any one who had ever known him
  in the past would have failed to recognize him now.</p>

  <p>In the early fall, with Nas Ta Bega as companion, he set out to the south
  of Kayenta upon long-neglected business of the trader. They visited Red Lake,
  Blue Canyon, Keams Canyon, Oribi, the Moki villages, Tuba, Moencopie, and
  Moen Ave. This trip took many weeks and gave Shefford all the opportunity he
  wanted to study the Indians, and the conditions nearer to the border of
  civilization. He learned the truth about the Indians and the
  missionaries.</p>

  <p>Upon the return trip he rode over the trail he had followed alone to Red
  Lake and thence on to the Sagi, and it seemed that years had passed since he
  first entered this wild region which had come to be home, years that had
  molded him in the stern and fiery crucible of the desert.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X.</a> &mdash; STONEBRIDGE</h2>

  <p class="first">IN October Shefford arranged for a hunt in the Cresaw
  Mountains with Joe Lake and Nas Ta Bega. The Indian had gone home for a short
  visit, and upon his return the party expected to start. But Nas Ta Bega did
  not come back. Then the arrival of a Piute with news that excited Withers and
  greatly perturbed Lake convinced Shefford that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The little trading-post seldom saw such disorder; certainly Shefford had
  never known the trader to neglect work. Joe Lake threw a saddle on a mustang
  he would have scorned to notice in an ordinary moment, and without a word of
  explanation or farewell rode hard to the north on the Stonebridge trail.</p>

  <p>Shefford had long since acquired patience. He was curious, but he did not
  care particularly what was in the wind. However, when Withers came out and
  sent an Indian to drive up the horses Shefford could not refrain from a
  query.</p>

  <p>"I hate to tell you," replied the trader.</p>

  <p>"Go on," added Shefford, quickly.</p>

  <p>"Did I tell you about the government sending a Supreme Court judge out to
  Utah to prosecute the polygamists?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to, I reckon. You've been away a lot. Well, there's been hell up
  in Utah for six months. Lately this judge and his men have worked down into
  southern Utah. He visited Bluff and Monticello a few weeks ago... Now what do
  you think?"</p>

  <p>"Withers! Is he coming to Stonebridge?"</p>

  <p>"He's there now. Some one betrayed the whereabouts of the hidden village
  over in the canyon. All the women have been arrested and taken to
  Stonebridge. The trial begins to-day."</p>

  <p>"Arrested!" echoed Shefford, blankly. "Those poor, lonely, good women?
  What on earth for?"</p>

  <p>"Sealed wives!" exclaimed Withers, tersely. "This judge is after the
  polygamists. They say he's absolutely relentless."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;women can't be polygamists. Their husbands are the ones
  wanted."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But the prosecutors have got to find the sealed wives&mdash;the
  second wives&mdash;to find the law-breaking husbands. That'll be a job, or I
  don't know Mormons... Are you going to ride over to Stonebridge with me?"</p>

  <p>Shefford shrank at the idea. Months of toil and pain and travail had not
  been enough to make him forget the strange girl he had loved. But he had
  remembered only at poignant intervals, and the lapse of time had made thought
  of her a dream like that sad dream which had lured him into the desert. With
  the query of the trader came a bitter-sweet regret.</p>

  <p>"Better come with me," said Withers. "Have you forgotten the Sago Lily?
  She'll be put on trial... That girl&mdash;that child!... Shefford, you know
  she hasn't any friends. And now no Mormon man are protect her, for fear of
  prosecution."</p>

  <p>"I'll go," replied Shefford, shortly.</p>

  <p>The Indian brought up the horses. Nack-yal was thin from his long travel
  during the hot summer, but he was as hard as iron, and the way he pointed his
  keen nose toward the Sagi showed how he wanted to make for the upland
  country, with its clear springs and valleys of grass. Withers mounted his bay
  and with a hurried farewell to his wife spurred the mustang into the trail.
  Shefford took time to get his weapons and the light pack he always carried,
  and then rode out after the trader.</p>

  <p>The pace Withers set was the long, steady lope to which these Indian
  mustangs had been trained all their lives. In an hour they reached the mouth
  of the Sagi, and at sight of it it seemed to Shefford that the hard half-year
  of suffering since he had been there had disappeared. Withers, to Shefford's
  regret, did not enter the Sagi. He turned off to the north and took a wild
  trail into a split of the red wall, and wound in and out, and climbed a crack
  so narrow that the light was obscured and the cliffs could be reached from
  both sides of a horse.</p>

  <p>Once up on the wild plateau, Shefford felt again in a different world from
  the barren desert he had lately known. The desert had crucified him and had
  left him to die or survive, according to his spirit and his strength. If he
  had loved the glare, the endless level, the deceiving distance, the shifting
  sand, it had certainly not been as he loved this softer, wilder, more
  intimate upland. With the red peaks shining up into the blue, and the
  fragrance of cedar and pinyon, and the purple sage and flowers and grass and
  splash of clear water over stones&mdash;with these there came back to him
  something that he had lost and which had haunted him.</p>

  <p>It seemed he had returned to this wild upland of color and canyon and
  lofty crags and green valleys and silent places with a spirit gained from
  victory over himself in the harsher and sterner desert below. And, strange to
  him, he found his old self, the dreamer, the artist, the lover of beauty, the
  searcher for he knew not what, come to meet him on the fragrant wind.</p>

  <p>He felt this, saw the old wildness with glad eyes, yet the greater part of
  his mind was given over to the thought of the unfortunate women he expected
  to see in Stonebridge.</p>

  <p>Withers was harder to follow, to keep up with, than an Indian. For one
  thing he was a steady and tireless rider, and for another there were times
  when he had no mercy on a horse. Then an Indian always found easier steps in
  a trail and shorter cuts. Withers put his mount to some bad slopes, and
  Shefford had no choice but to follow. But they crossed the great broken bench
  of upland without mishap, and came out upon a promontory of a plateau from
  which Shefford saw a wide valley and the dark-green alfalfa fields of
  Stonebridge.</p>

  <p>Stonebridge lay in the center of a fertile valley surrounded by pink
  cliffs. It must have been a very old town, certainly far older than Bluff or
  Monticello, though smaller, and evidently it had been built to last. There
  was one main street, very wide, that divided the town and was crossed at
  right angles by a stream spanned by a small natural stone bridge. A line of
  poplar- trees shaded each foot-path. The little log cabins and stone houses
  and cottages were half hidden in foliage now tinted with autumn colors.
  Toward the center of the town the houses and stores and shops fronted upon
  the street and along one side of a green square, or plaza. Here were situated
  several edifices, the most prominent of which was a church built of wood,
  whitewashed, and remarkable, according to Withers, for the fact that not a
  nail had been used in its construction. Beyond the church was a large, low
  structure of stone, with a split-shingle roof, and evidently this was the
  town hall.</p>

  <p>Shefford saw, before he reached the square, that this day in Stonebridge
  was one of singular action and excitement for a Mormon village. The town was
  full of people and, judging from the horses hitched everywhere and the big
  canvas-covered wagons, many of the people were visitors. A crowd surrounded
  the hall&mdash;a dusty, booted, spurred, shirt-sleeved and sombreroed
  assemblage that did not wear the hall-mark Shefford had come to associate
  with Mormons. They were riders, cowboys, horse-wranglers, and some of them
  Shefford had seen in Durango. Navajos and Piutes were present, also, but they
  loitered in the background.</p>

  <p>Withers drew Shefford off to the side where, under a tree, they hitched
  their horses.</p>

  <p>"Never saw Stonebridge full of a riffraff gang like this to-day," said
  Withers. "I'll bet the Mormons are wild. There's a tough outfit from Durango.
  If they can get anything to drink&mdash;or if they've got it&mdash;
  Stonebridge will see smoke to-day!... Come on. I'll get in that hall."</p>

  <p>But before Withers reached the hall he started violently and pulled up
  short, then, with apparent unconcern, turned to lay a hand upon Shefford. The
  trader's face had blanched and his eyes grew hard and shiny, like flint. He
  gripped Shefford's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look! Over to your left!" he whispered. "See that gang of Indians there
  &mdash;by the big wagon. See the short Indian with the chaps. He's got a face
  big as a ham, dark, fierce. That's Shadd!... You ought to know him. Shadd and
  his outfit here! How's that for nerve? But he pulls a rein with the
  Mormons."</p>

  <p>Shefford's keen eye took in a lounging group of ten or twelve Indians and
  several white men. They did not present any great contrast to the other
  groups except that they were isolated, appeared quiet and watchful, and were
  all armed. A bunch of lean, racy mustangs, restive and spirited, stood near
  by in charge of an Indian. Shefford had to take a second and closer glance to
  distinguish the half-breed. At once he recognized in Shadd the broad-faced
  squat Indian who had paid him a threatening visit that night long ago in the
  mouth of the Sagi. A fire ran along Shefford's veins and seemed to
  concentrate in his breast. Shadd's dark, piercing eyes alighted upon Shefford
  and rested there. Then the half-breed spoke to one of his white outlaws and
  pointed at Shefford. His action attracted the attention of others in the
  gang, and for a moment Shefford and Withers were treated to a keen-eyed
  stare.</p>

  <p>The trader cursed low. "Maybe I wouldn't like to mix it with that damned
  breed," he said. "But what chance have we with that gang? Besides, we're here
  on other and more important business. All the same, before I forget, let me
  remind you that Shadd has had you spotted ever since you came out here. A
  friendly Piute told me only lately. Shefford, did any Indian between here and
  Flagstaff ever see that bunch of money you persist in carrying?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, I suppose so&mdash;'way back in Tuba, when I first came out,"
  replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Well, Shadd's after that... Come on now, let's get inside the
  hall."</p>

  <p>The crowd opened for the trader, who appeared to be known to
  everybody.</p>

  <p>A huge man with a bushy beard blocked the way to a shut door.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Meade!" said Withers. "Let us in."</p>

  <p>The man opened the door, permitted Withers and Shefford to enter, and then
  closed it.</p>

  <p>Shefford, coming out of the bright glare of sun into the hall, could not
  see distinctly at first. His eyes blurred. He heard a subdued murmur of many
  voices. Withers appeared to be affected with the same kind of blindness, for
  he stood bewildered a moment. But he recovered sooner than Shefford.
  Gradually the darkness shrouding many obscure forms lifted. Withers drew him
  through a crowd of men and women to one side of the hall, and squeezed along
  a wall to a railing where progress was stopped.</p>

  <p>Then Shefford raised his head to look with bated breath and strange
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>The hall was large and had many windows. Men were in consultation upon a
  platform. Women to the number of twenty sat close together upon benches. Back
  of them stood another crowd. But the women on the benches held Shefford's
  gaze. They were the prisoners. They made a somber group. Some were hooded,
  some veiled, all clad in dark garments except one on the front bench, and she
  was dressed in white. She wore a long hood that concealed her face. Shefford
  recognized the hood and then the slender shape. She was Mary&mdash;she whom
  her jealous neighbors had named the Sago Lily. At sight of her a sharp pain
  pierced Shefford's breast. His eyes were blurred when he forced them away
  from her, and it took a moment for him to see clearly.</p>

  <p>Withers was whispering to him or to some one near at hand, but Shefford
  did not catch the meaning of what was said. He paid more attention; however,
  Withers ceased speaking. Shefford gazed upon the crowd back of him. The women
  were hooded and it was not possible to see what they looked like. There were
  many stalwart, clean-cut, young Mormons of Joe Lake's type, and these men
  appeared troubled, even distressed and at a loss. There was little about them
  resembling the stern, quiet, somber austerity of the more matured men, and
  nothing at all of the strange, aloof, serene impassiveness of the
  gray-bearded old patriarchs. These venerable men were the Mormons of the old
  school, the sons of the pioneers, the ruthless fanatics. Instinctively
  Shefford felt that it was in them that polygamy was embodied; they were the
  husbands of the sealed wives. He conceived an absorbing curiosity to learn if
  his instinct was correct; and hard upon that followed a hot, hateful
  eagerness to see which one was the husband of Mary.</p>

  <p>"There's Bishop Kane," whispered Withers, nudging Shefford. "And there's
  Waggoner with him."</p>

  <p>Shefford saw the bishop, and then beside him a man of striking
  presence.</p>

  <p>"Who's Waggoner?" asked Shefford, as he looked.</p>

  <p>"He owns more than any Mormon in southern Utah," replied the trader. "He's
  the biggest man in Stonebridge, that's sure. But I don't know his relation to
  the Church. They don't call him elder or bishop. But I'll bet he's some
  pumpkins. He never had any use for me or any Gentile. A close-fisted,
  tight-lipped Mormon&mdash;a skinflint if I ever saw one! Just look him
  over."</p>

  <p>Shefford had been looking, and considered it unlikely that he would ever
  forget this individual called Waggoner. He seemed old, sixty at least, yet at
  that only in the prime of a wonderful physical life. Unlike most of the
  others, he wore his grizzled beard close-cropped, so close that it showed the
  lean, wolfish line of his jaw. All his features were of striking sharpness.
  His eyes, of a singularly brilliant blue, were yet cold and pale. The brow
  had a serious, thoughtful cast; long furrows sloped down the cheeks. It was a
  strange, secretive face, full of a power that Shefford had not seen in
  another man's, full of intelligence and thought that had not been used as
  Shefford had known them used among men. The face mystified him. It had so
  much more than the strange aloofness so characteristic of his fellows.</p>

  <p>"Waggoner had five wives and fifty-five children before the law went into
  effect," whispered Withers. "Nobody knows and nobody will ever know how many
  he's got now. That's my private opinion."</p>

  <p>Somehow, after Withers told that, Shefford seemed to understand the
  strange power in Waggoner's face. Absolutely it was not the force, the
  strength given to a man from his years of control of men. Shefford, long
  schooled now in his fair-mindedness, fought down the feelings of other years,
  and waited with patience. Who was he to judge Waggoner or any other Mormon?
  But whenever his glance strayed back to the quiet, slender form in white,
  when he realized again and again the appalling nature of this court, his
  heart beat heavy and labored within his breast.</p>

  <p>Then a bustle among the men upon the platform appeared to indicate that
  proceedings were about to begin. Some men left the platform; several sat down
  at a table upon which were books and papers, and others remained standing.
  These last were all roughly garbed, in riding-boots and spurs, and Shefford's
  keen eye detected the bulge of hidden weapons. They looked like
  deputy-marshals upon duty.</p>

  <p>Somebody whispered that the judge's name was Stone. The name fitted him.
  He was not young, and looked a man suited to the prosecution of these secret
  Mormons. He had a ponderous brow, a deep, cavernous eye that emitted gleams
  but betrayed no color or expression. His mouth was the saving human feature
  of his stony face.</p>

  <p>Shefford took the man upon the judge's right hand to be a lawyer, and the
  one on his left an officer of court, perhaps a prosecuting attorney.
  Presently this fellow pounded upon the table and stood up as if to address a
  court-room. Certainly he silenced that hallful of people. Then he
  perfunctorily and briefly stated that certain women had been arrested upon
  suspicion of being sealed wives of Mormon polygamists, and were to be
  herewith tried by a judge of the United States Court. Shefford felt how the
  impressive words affected that silent hall of listeners, but he gathered from
  the brief preliminaries that the trial could not be otherwise than a crude,
  rapid investigation, and perhaps for that the more sinister.</p>

  <p>The first woman on the foremost bench was led forward by a deputy to a
  vacant chair on the platform just in front of the judge's table. She was told
  to sit down, and showed no sign that she had heard. Then the judge
  courteously asked her to take the chair. She refused. And Stone nodded his
  head as if he had experienced that sort of thing before. He stroked his chin
  wearily, and Shefford conceived an idea that he was a kind man, if he was a
  relentless judge.</p>

  <p>"Please remove your veil," requested the prosecutor.</p>

  <p>The woman did so, and proved to be young and handsome. Shefford had a
  thrill as he recognized her. She was Ruth, who had been one of his best-known
  acquaintances in the hidden village. She was pale, angry, almost sullen, and
  her breast heaved. She had no shame, but she seemed to be outraged. Her dark
  eyes, scornful and blazing, passed over the judge and his assistants, and on
  to the crowd behind the railing. Shefford, keen as a blade, with all his
  faculties absorbed, fancied he saw Ruth stiffen and change slightly as her
  glance encountered some one in that crowd. Then the prosecutor in deliberate
  and chosen words enjoined her to kiss the Bible handed to her and swear to
  tell the truth. How strange for Shefford to see her kiss the book which he
  had studied for so many years! Stranger still to hear the low murmur from the
  listening audience as she took the oath!</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" asked Judge Stone, leaning back and fixing the
  cavernous eyes upon her.</p>

  <p>"Ruth Jones," was the cool reply.</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty."</p>

  <p>"Where were you born?" went on the judge. He allowed time for the clerk to
  record her answers.</p>

  <p>"Panguitch, Utah."</p>

  <p>"Were your parents Mormons?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you a Mormon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you a married woman?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The answer was instant, cold, final. It seemed to the truth. Almost
  Shefford believed she spoke truth. The judge stroked his chin and waited a
  moment, and then hesitatingly he went on.</p>

  <p>"Have you&mdash;any children?"</p>

  <p>"No." And the blazing eyes met the cavernous ones.</p>

  <p>That about the children was true enough, Shefford thought, and he could
  have testified to it.</p>

  <p>"You live in the hidden village near this town?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What is the name of this village?"</p>

  <p>"It has none."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of Fre-donia, another village far west of here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It is in Arizona, near the Utah line. There are few men there. Is it the
  same kind of village as this one in which you live?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What does Fre-donia mean? The name&mdash;has it any meaning?"</p>

  <p>"It means free women."</p>

  <p>The judge maintained silence for a moment, turned to whisper to his
  assistants, and presently, without glancing up, said to the woman:</p>

  <p>"That will do."</p>

  <p>Ruth was led back to the bench, and the woman next to her brought forward.
  This was a heavier person, with the figure and step of a matured woman. Upon
  removing her bonnet she showed the plain face of a woman of forty, and it was
  striking only in that strange, stony aloofness noted in the older men. Here,
  Shefford thought, was the real Mormon, different in a way he could not define
  from Ruth. This woman seated herself in the chair and calmly faced her
  prosecutors. She manifested no emotion whatever. Shefford remembered her and
  could not see any change in her deportment. This trial appeared to be of
  little moment to her and she took the oath as if doing so had been a habit
  all her life.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" asked Judge Stone, glancing up from a paper he
  held.</p>

  <p>"Mary Danton."</p>

  <p>"Family or married name?"</p>

  <p>"My husband's name was Danton."</p>

  <p>"Was. Is he living?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Where did you live when you were married to him?"</p>

  <p>"In St. George, and later here in Stonebridge."</p>

  <p>"You were both Mormons?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you have any children by him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How many?"</p>

  <p>"Two."</p>

  <p>"Are they living?"</p>

  <p>"One of them is living."</p>

  <p>Judge Stone bent over his paper and then slowly raised his eyes to her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Are you married now?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Again the judge consulted his notes, and held a whispered colloquy with
  the two men at his table.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Danton, when you were arrested there were five children found in
  your home. To whom do they belong?"</p>

  <p>"Me."</p>

  <p>"Are you their mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Your husband Danton is the father of only one, the eldest, according to
  your former statement. Is that correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Who, then, is the father&mdash;or who are the fathers, of your other
  children?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>She said it with the most stony-faced calmness, with utter disregard of
  what significance her words had. A strong, mystic wall of cold flint
  insulated her. Strangely it came to Shefford how impossible either to doubt
  or believe her. Yet he did both! Judge Stone showed a little heat.</p>

  <p>"You don't know the father of one or all of these children?" he queried,
  with sharp rising inflection of voice.</p>

  <p>"I do not."</p>

  <p>"Madam, I beg to remind you that you are under oath."</p>

  <p>The woman did not reply.</p>

  <p>"These children are nameless, then&mdash;illegitimate?"</p>

  <p>"They are."</p>

  <p>"You swear you are not the sealed wife of some Mormon?"</p>

  <p>"I swear."</p>

  <p>"How do you live&mdash;maintain yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I work."</p>

  <p>"What at?"</p>

  <p>"I weave, sew, bake, and work in my garden."</p>

  <p>"My men made note of your large and comfortable cabin, even luxurious,
  considering this country. How is that?"</p>

  <p>"My husband left me comfortable."</p>

  <p>Judge Stone shook a warning finger at the defendant.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I were to sentence you to jail for perjury? For a year? Far from
  your home and children! Would you speak&mdash;tell the truth?"</p>

  <p>"I am telling the truth. I can't speak what I don't know... Send me to
  jail."</p>

  <p>Baffled, with despairing, angry impatience, Judge Stone waved the woman
  away.</p>

  <p>"That will do for her. Fetch the next one," he said.</p>

  <p>One after another he examined three more women, and arrived, by various
  questions and answers different in tone and temper, at precisely the same
  point as had been made in the case of Mrs. Danton. Thereupon the proceedings
  rested a few moments while the judge consulted with his assistants.</p>

  <p>Shefford was grateful for this respite. He had been worked up to an
  unusual degree of interest, and now, as the next Mormon woman to be examined
  was she whom he had loved and loved still, he felt rise in him emotion that
  threatened to make him conspicuous unless it could be hidden. The answers of
  these Mormon women had been not altogether unexpected by him, but once spoken
  in cold blood under oath, how tragic, how appallingly significant of the
  shadow, the mystery, the yoke that bound them! He was amazed, saddened. He
  felt bewildered. He needed to think out the meaning of the falsehoods of
  women he knew to be good and noble. Surely religion, instead of fear and
  loyalty, was the foundation and the strength of this disgrace, this
  sacrifice. Absolutely, shame was not in these women, though they swore to
  shameful facts. They had been coached to give these baffling answers, every
  one of which seemed to brand them, not the brazen mothers of illegitimate
  offspring, but faithful, unfortunate sealed wives. To Shefford the truth was
  not in their words, but it sat upon their somber brows.</p>

  <p>Was it only his heightened imagination, or did the silence and the
  suspense grow more intense when a deputy led that dark-hooded, white-clad,
  slender woman to the defendant's chair? She did not walk with the poise that
  had been manifest in the other women, and she sank into the chair as if she
  could no longer stand.</p>

  <p>"Please remove your hood," requested the prosecutor.</p>

  <p>How well Shefford remembered the strong, shapely hands! He saw them
  tremble at the knot of ribbon, and that tremor was communicated to him in a
  sympathy which made his pulses beat. He held his breath while she removed the
  hood. And then there was revealed, he thought, the loveliest and the most
  tragic face that ever was seen in a court-room.</p>

  <p>A low, whispering murmur that swelled like a wave ran through the hall.
  And by it Shefford divined, as clearly as if the fact had been blazoned on
  the walls, that Mary's face had been unknown to these villagers. But the name
  Sago Lily had not been unknown; Shefford heard it whispered on all sides.</p>

  <p>The murmuring subsided. The judge and his assistants stared at Mary. As
  for Shefford, there was no need of his personal feeling to make the situation
  dramatic. Not improbably Judge Stone had tried many Mormon women. But
  manifestly this one was different. Unhooded, Mary appeared to be only a young
  girl, and a court, confronted suddenly with her youth and the suspicion
  attached to her, could not but have been shocked. Then her beauty made her
  seem, in that somber company, indeed the white flower for which she had been
  named. But, more likely, it was her agony that bound the court into silence
  which grew painful. Perhaps the thought that flashed into Shefford's mind was
  telepathic; it seemed to him that every watcher there realized that in this
  defendant the judge had a girl of softer mold, of different spirit, and from
  her the bitter truth could be wrung.</p>

  <p>Mary faced the court and the crowd on that side of the platform. Unlike
  the other women, she did not look at or seem to see any one behind the
  railing. Shefford was absolutely sure there was not a man or a woman who
  caught her glance. She gazed afar, with eyes strained, humid, fearful.</p>

  <p>When the prosecutor swore her to the oath her lips were seen to move, but
  no one heard her speak.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" asked the judge.</p>

  <p>"Mary." Her voice was low, with a slight tremor.</p>

  <p>"What's your other name?"</p>

  <p>"I won't tell."</p>

  <p>Her singular reply, the tones of her voice, her manner before the judge,
  marked her with strange simplicity. It was evident that she was not
  accustomed to questions.</p>

  <p>"What were your parents' names?"</p>

  <p>"I won't tell," she replied, very low.</p>

  <p>Judge Stone did not press the point. Perhaps he wanted to make the
  examination as easy as possible for her or to wait till she showed more
  composure.</p>

  <p>"Were your parents Mormons?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"No, sir." She added the sir with a quaint respect, contrasting markedly
  with the short replies of the women before her.</p>

  <p>"Then you were not born a Mormon?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Seventeen or eighteen. I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>"You don't know your exact age?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Where were you born?"</p>

  <p>"I won't tell."</p>

  <p>"Was it in Utah?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"How long have you lived in this state?"</p>

  <p>"Always&mdash;except last year."</p>

  <p>"And that's been over in the hidden village where you were arrested?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But you often visited here&mdash;this town Stonebridge?"</p>

  <p>"I never was here&mdash;till yesterday."</p>

  <p>Judge Stone regarded her as if his interest as a man was running counter
  to his duty as an officer. Suddenly he leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Are you a Mormon NOW?" he queried, forcibly.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she replied, and here her voice rose a little clearer.</p>

  <p>It was an unexpected reply. Judge Stone stared at her. The low buzz ran
  through the listening crowd. And as for Shefford, he was astounded. When his
  wits flashed back and he weighed her words and saw in her face truth as clear
  as light, he had the strangest sensation of joy. Almost it flooded away the
  gloom and pain that attended this ordeal.</p>

  <p>The judge bent his head to his assistants as if for counsel. All of them
  were eager where formerly they had been weary. Shefford glanced around at the
  dark and somber faces, and a slow wrath grew within him. Then he caught a
  glimpse of Waggoner. The steel-blue, piercing intensity of the Mormon's gaze
  impressed him at a moment when all that older generation of Mormons looked as
  hard and immutable as iron. Either Shefford was over-excited and mistaken or
  the hour had become fraught with greater suspense. The secret, the mystery,
  the power, the hate, the religion of a strange people were thick and tangible
  in that hall. For Shefford the feeling of the presence of Withers on his left
  was entirely different from that of the Mormon on his other side. If there
  was not a shadow there, then the sun did not shine so brightly as it had
  shone when he entered. The air seemed clogged with nameless passion.</p>

  <p>"I gather that you've lived mostly in the country&mdash;away from people?"
  the judge began.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about the government of the United States?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>He pondered again, evidently weighing his queries, leading up to the fatal
  and inevitable question.</p>

  <p>Still, his interest in this particular defendant had become visible.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea of the consequences of perjury?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do you understand what perjury is?"</p>

  <p>"It's to lie."</p>

  <p>"Do you tell lies?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever told a single lie?"</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;yet," she replied, almost whispering.</p>

  <p>It was the answer of a child and affected the judge. He fussed with his
  papers. Perhaps his task was not easy; certainly it was not pleasant. Then he
  leaned forward again and fixed those deep, cavernous eyes upon the sad
  face.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand what a sealed wife is?"</p>

  <p>"I've never been told."</p>

  <p>"But you know there are sealed wives in Utah?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; I've been told that."</p>

  <p>Judge Stone halted there, watching her. The hall was silent except for
  faint rustlings and here and there deep breaths drawn guardedly. The vital
  question hung like a sword over the white-faced girl. Perhaps she divined its
  impending stroke, for she sat like a stone with dilating, appealing eyes upon
  her executioner.</p>

  <p>"Are you a sealed wife?" he flung at her.</p>

  <p>She could not answer at once. She made effort, but the words would not
  come. He flung the question again, sternly.</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried.</p>

  <p>And then there was silence. That poignant word quivered in Shefford's
  heart. He believed it was a lie. It seemed he would have known it if this
  hour was the first in which he had ever seen the girl. He heard, he felt, he
  sensed the fatal thing. The beautiful voice had lacked some quality before
  present. And the thing wanting was something subtle, an essence, a beautiful
  ring&mdash;the truth. What a hellish thing to make that pure girl a liar
  &mdash;a perjurer! The heat deep within Shefford kindled to fire.</p>

  <p>"You are not married?" went on Judge Stone.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she answered, faintly.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been married?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do you expect ever to be married?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! No, sir."</p>

  <p>She was ashen pale now, quivering all over, with her strong hands clasping
  the black hood, and she could no longer meet the judge's glance.</p>

  <p>"Have you&mdash;any&mdash;any children?" the judge asked, haltingly. It
  was a hard question to get out.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Judge Stone leaned far over the table, and that his face was purple showed
  Shefford he was a man. His big fist clenched.</p>

  <p>"Girl, you're not going to swear you, too, were visited&mdash;over there
  by men... You're not going to swear that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;no, sir!"</p>

  <p>Judge Stone settled back in his chair, and while he wiped his moist face
  that same foreboding murmur, almost a menace, moaned through the hall.</p>

  <p>Shefford was sick in his soul and afraid of himself. He did not know this
  spirit that flamed up in him. His helplessness was a most hateful fact.</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;confess you are a sealed wife," called her interrogator.</p>

  <p>She maintained silence, but shook her head.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he seemed to leap forward.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunate child! Confess."</p>

  <p>That forced her to lift her head and face him, yet still she did not
  speak. It was the strength of despair. She could not endure much more.</p>

  <p>"Who is your husband?" he thundered at her.</p>

  <p>She rose wildly, terror-stricken. It was terror that dominated her, not of
  the stern judge, for she took a faltering step toward him, lifting a shaking
  hand, but of some one or of some thing far more terrible than any punishment
  she could have received in the sentence of a court. Still she was not proof
  against the judge's will. She had weakened, and the terror must have been
  because of that weakening.</p>

  <p>"Who is the Mormon who visits you?" he thundered, relentlessly.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;never&mdash;knew&mdash;his&mdash;name.</p>

  <p>"But you'd know his face. I'll arrest every Mormon in this country and
  bring him before you. You'd know his face?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't. I COULDN'T TELL!... <i>I</i>&mdash;NEVER&mdash;SAW HIS
  FACE&mdash;IN THE LIGHT!"</p>

  <p>The tragic beauty of her, the certainty of some monstrous crime to youth
  and innocence, the presence of an agony and terror that unfathomably seemed
  not to be for herself&mdash;these transfixed the court and the audience, and
  held them silenced, till she reached out blindly and then sank in a heap to
  the floor.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI.</a> &mdash; AFTER THE TRIAL</h2>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD might have leaped over the railing but for
  Withers's restraining hand, and when there appeared to be some sign of
  kindness in those other women for the unconscious girl Shefford squeezed
  through the crowd and got out of the hall.</p>

  <p>The gang outside that had been denied admittance pressed upon Shefford,
  with jest and curious query, and a good nature that jarred upon him. He was
  far from gentle as he jostled off the first importuning fellows; the others,
  gaping at him, opened a lane for him to pass through.</p>

  <p>Then there was a hand laid on his shoulder that he did not shake off. Nas
  Ta Bega loomed dark and tall beside him. Neither the trader nor Joe Lake nor
  any white man Shefford had met influenced him as this Navajo.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega! you here, too. I guess the whole country is here. We waited
  at Kayenta. What kept you so long?"</p>

  <p>The Indian, always slow to answer, did not open his lips till he drew
  Shefford apart from the noisy crowd.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, there is sorrow in the hogan of Hosteen Doetin," he said.</p>

  <p>"Glen Naspa!" exclaimed Shefford.</p>

  <p>"My sister is gone from the home of her brother. She went away alone in
  the summer."</p>

  <p>"Blue Canyon! She went to the missionary. Nas Ta Bega, I thought I saw her
  there. But I wasn't sure. I didn't want to make sure. I was afraid it might
  be true."</p>

  <p>"A brave who loved my sister trailed her there."</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, will you&mdash;will we go find her, take her home?"</p>

  <p>"No. She will come home some day."</p>

  <p>What bitter sadness and wisdom in his words!</p>

  <p>"But, my friend, that damned missionary&mdash;" began Shefford,
  passionately. The Indian had met him at a bad hour.</p>

  <p>"Willetts is here. I saw him go in there," interrupted Nas Ta Bega, and he
  pointed to the hall.</p>

  <p>"Here! He gets around a good deal," declared Shefford. "Nas Ta Bega, what
  are you going to do to him?"</p>

  <p>The Indian held his peace and there was no telling from his inscrutable
  face what might be in his mind. He was dark, impassive. He seemed a wise and
  bitter Indian, beyond any savagery of his tribe, and the suffering Shefford
  divined was deep.</p>

  <p>"He'd better keep out of my sight," muttered Shefford, more to himself
  than to his companion.</p>

  <p>"The half-breed is here," said Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>"Shadd? Yes, we saw him. There! He's still with his gang. Nas Ta Bega,
  what are they up to?"</p>

  <p>"They will steal what they can."</p>

  <p>"Withers says Shadd is friendly with the Mormons."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and with the missionary, too."</p>

  <p>"With Willetts?"</p>

  <p>"I saw them talk together&mdash;strong talk."</p>

  <p>"Strange. But maybe it's not so strange. Shadd is known well in Monticello
  and Bluff. He spends money there. They are afraid of him, but he's welcome
  just the same. Perhaps everybody knows him. It'd be like him to ride into
  Kayenta. But, Nas Ta Bega, I've got to look out for him, because Withers says
  he's after me."</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai wears a scar that is proof," said the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Then it must be he found out long ago I had a little money."</p>

  <p>"It might be. But, Bi Nai, the half-breed has a strange step on your
  trail."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega cannot tell what he does not know," replied the Navajo. "Let
  that be. We shall know some day. Bi Nai, there is sorrow to tell that is not
  the Indian's... Sorrow for my brother!"</p>

  <p>Shefford lifted his eyes to the Indian's, and if he did not see sadness
  there he was much deceived.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, long ago you told a story to the trader. Nas Ta Bega sat before
  the fire that night. You did not know he could understand your language. He
  listened. And he learned what brought you to the country of the Indian. That
  night he made you his brother... All his lonely rides into the canyon have
  been to find the little golden-haired child, the lost girl&mdash;Fay Larkin
  ... Bi Nai, I have found the girl you wanted for your sweetheart."</p>

  <p>Shefford was bereft of speech. He could not see steadily, and the last
  solemn words of the Indian seemed far away.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, I have found Fay Larkin," repeated Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>"Fay Larkin!" gasped Shefford, shaking his head. "But&mdash;she's
  dead."</p>

  <p>"It would be less sorrow for Bi Nai if she were dead."</p>

  <p>Shefford clutched at the Indian. There was something terrible to be
  revealed. Like an aspen-leaf in the wind he shook all over. He divined the
  revelation&mdash;divined the coming blow&mdash;but that was as far as his
  mind got.</p>

  <p>"She's in there," said the Indian, pointing toward hall.</p>

  <p>"Fay Larkin?" whispered Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Bi Nai."</p>

  <p>"My God! HOW do you know? Oh, I could have seen. I've been blind... Tell
  me, Indian. Which one?"</p>

  <p>"Fay Larkin is the Sago Lily."</p>

  <p>. . . . . . . . . .</p>

  <p>Shefford strode away into a secluded corner of the Square, where in the
  shade and quiet of the trees he suffered a storm of heart and mind. During
  that short or long time&mdash;he had no idea how long&mdash;the Indian
  remained with him. He never lost the feeling of Nas Ta Bega close beside him.
  When the period of acute pain left him and some order began to replace the
  tumult in his mind he felt in Nas Ta Bega the same quality&mdash;silence or
  strength or help&mdash;that he had learned to feel in the deep canyon and the
  lofty crags. He realized then that the Indian was indeed a brother. And
  Shefford needed him. What he had to fight was more fatal than suffering and
  love&mdash;it was hate rising out of the unsuspected dark gulf of his heart
  &mdash;the instinct to kill&mdash;the murder in his soul. Only now did he
  come to understand Jane Withersteen's tragic story and the passion of Venters
  and what had made Lassiter a gun-man. The desert had transformed Shefford.
  The elements had entered into his muscle and bone, into the very fiber of his
  heart. Sun, wind, sand, cold, storm, space, stone, the poison cactus, the
  racking toil, the terrible loneliness&mdash;the iron of the desert man, the
  cruelty of the desert savage, the wildness of the mustang, the ferocity of
  hawk and wolf, the bitter struggle of every surviving thing&mdash;these were
  as if they had been melted and merged together and now made a dark and
  passionate stream that was his throbbing blood. He realized what he had
  become and gloried in it, yet there, looking on with grave and earnest eyes,
  was his old self, the man of reason, of intellect, of culture, who had been a
  good man despite the failure and shame of his life. And he gave heed to the
  voice of warning, of conscience. Not by revengefully seeking the Mormon who
  had ruined Fay Larkin and blindly dealing a wild justice could he help this
  unfortunate girl. This fierce, newborn strength and passion must be tempered
  by reason, lest he become merely elemental, a man answering wholly to
  primitive impulses. In the darkness of that hour he mined deep into his
  heart, understood himself, trembled at the thing he faced, and won his
  victory. He would go forth from that hour a man. He might fight, and perhaps
  there was death in the balance, but hate would never overthrow him.</p>

  <p>Then when he looked at future action he felt a strange, unalterable
  purpose to save Fay Larkin. She was very young&mdash;seventeen or eighteen,
  she had said&mdash;and there could be, there must be some happiness before
  her. It had been his dream to chase a rainbow&mdash;it had been his
  determination to find her in the lost Surprise Valley. Well, he had found
  her. It never occurred to him to ask Nas Ta Bega how he had discovered that
  the Sago Lily was Fay Larkin. The wonder was, Shefford thought, that he had
  so long been blind himself. How simply everything worked out now! Every
  thought, every recollection of her was proof. Her strange beauty like that of
  the sweet and rare lily, her low voice that showed the habit of silence, her
  shapely hands with the clasp strong as a man's, her lithe form, her swift
  step, her wonderful agility upon the smooth, steep trails, and the wildness
  of her upon the heights, and the haunting, brooding shadow of her eyes when
  she gazed across the canyon&mdash;all these fitted so harmoniously the
  conception of a child lost in a beautiful Surprise Valley and growing up in
  its wildness and silence, tutored by the sad love of broken Jane and
  Lassiter. Yes, to save her had been Shefford's dream, and he had loved that
  dream. He had loved the dream and he had loved the child. The secret of her
  hiding-place as revealed by the story told him and his slow growth from dream
  to action&mdash;these had strangely given Fay Larkin to him. Then had come
  the bitter knowledge that she was dead. In the light of this subsequent
  revelation how easy to account for his loving Mary, too. Never would she be
  Mary again to him! Fay Larkin and the Sago Lily were one and the same. She
  was here, near him, and he was powerless for the present to help her or to
  reveal himself. She was held back there in that gloomy hall among those
  somber Mormons, alien to the women, bound in some fatal way to one of the
  men, and now, by reason of her weakness in the trial, surely to be hated.
  Thinking of her past and her present, of the future, and that secret Mormon
  hose face she had never seen, Shefford felt a sinking of his heart, a
  terrible cold pang in his breast, a fainting of his spirit. She had sworn she
  was no sealed wife. But had she not lied? So, then, how utterly powerless he
  was!</p>

  <p>But here to save him, to uplift him, came that strange mystic insight
  which had been the gift of the desert to him. She was not dead. He had found
  her. What mattered obstacles, even that implacable creed to which she had
  been sacrificed, in the face of this blessed and overwhelming truth? It was
  as mighty as the love suddenly dawning upon him. A strong and terrible and
  deathly sweet wind seemed to fill his soul with the love of her. It was her
  fate that had drawn him; and now it was her agony, her innocence, her beauty,
  that bound him for all time. Patience and cunning and toil, passion and
  blood, the unquenchable spirit of a man to save&mdash;these were nothing to
  give&mdash;life itself were little, could he but free her.</p>

  <p>Patience and cunning! His sharpening mind cut these out as his greatest
  assets for the present. And his thoughts flashed like light through his brain
  ... Judge Stone and his court would fail to convict any Mormon in
  Stonebridge, just the same as they had failed in the northern towns. They
  would go away, and Stonebridge would fall to the slow, sleepy tenor of its
  former way. The hidden village must become known to all men, honest and
  outlawed, in that country, but this fact would hardly make any quick change
  in the plans of the Mormons. They did not soon change. They would send the
  sealed wives back to the canyon and, after the excitement had died down,
  visit them as usual. Nothing, perhaps, would ever change these old Mormons
  but death.</p>

  <p>Shefford resolved to remain in Stonebridge and ingratiate himself deeper
  into the regard of the Mormons. He would find work there, if the sealed wives
  were not returned to the hidden village. In case the women went back to the
  valley Shefford meant to resume his old duty of driving Withers's
  pack-trains. Wanting that opportunity, he would find some other work, some
  excuse to take him there. In due time he would reveal to Fay Larkin that he
  knew her. How the thought thrilled him! She might deny, might persist in her
  fear, might fight to keep her secret. But he would learn it&mdash;hear her
  story&mdash;hear what had become of Jane Withersteen and Lassiter&mdash; and
  if they were alive, which now he believed he would find them&mdash;and he
  would take them and Fay out of the country.</p>

  <p>The duty, the great task, held a grim fascination for him. He had a
  foreboding of the cost; he had a dark realization of the force he meant to
  oppose. There were duty here and pity and unselfish love, but these alone did
  not actuate Shefford. Mystically fate seemed again to come like a gleam and
  bid him follow.</p>

  <p>When Shefford and Nas Ta Bega returned to the town hall the trial had been
  ended, the hall was closed, and only a few Indians and cowboys remained in
  the square, and they were about to depart. On the street, however, and the
  paths and in the doorways of stores were knots of people, talking earnestly.
  Shefford walked up and down, hoping to meet Withers or Joe Lake. Nas Ta Bega
  said he would take the horses to water and feed and then return.</p>

  <p>There were indications that Stonebridge might experience some of the
  excitement and perhaps violence common to towns like Monticello and Durango.
  There was only one saloon in Stonebridge, and it was full of roystering
  cowboys and horse-wranglers. Shefford saw the bunch of mustangs, in charge of
  the same Indian, that belonged to Shadd and his gang. The men were inside,
  drinking. Next door was a tavern called Hopewell House, a stone structure of
  some pretensions. There were Indians lounging outside. Shefford entered
  through a wide door and found himself in a large bare room, boarded like a
  loft, with no ceiling except the roof. The place was full of men and noise.
  Here he encountered Joe Lake talking to Bishop Kane and other Mormons.
  Shefford got a friendly greeting from the bishop, and then was well received
  by the strangers, to whom Joe introduced him.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Withers?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Reckon he's around somewhere," replied Joe. "Better hang up here, for
  he'll drop in sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"When are you going back to Kayenta?" went on Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Hard to say. We'll have to call off our hunt. Nas Ta Bega is here,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've been with him."</p>

  <p>The older Mormons drew aside, and then Joe mentioned the fact that he was
  half starved. Shefford went with him into another clapboard room, which was
  evidently a dining-room. There were half a dozen men at the long table. The
  seat at the end was a box, and scarcely large enough or safe enough for Joe
  and Shefford, but they risked it.</p>

  <p>"Saw you in the hall," said Joe. "Hell&mdash;wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Joe, I never knew how much I dared say to you, so I don't talk much. But,
  it was hell," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be so scared of me," spoke up Joe, testily.</p>

  <p>That was the first time Shefford had heard the Mormon speak that way.</p>

  <p>"I'm not scared, Joe. But I like you&mdash;respect you. I can't say so
  much of&mdash;of your people."</p>

  <p>"Did you stick out the whole mix?" asked Joe.</p>

  <p>"No. I had enough when&mdash;when they got through with Mary." Shefford
  spoke low and dropped his head. He heard the Mormon grind his teeth. There
  was silence for a little space while neither man looked at the other.</p>

  <p>"Reckon the judge was pretty decent," presently said Joe.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought so. He might have&mdash;" But Shefford did not finish that
  sentence. "How'd the thing end?"</p>

  <p>"It ended all right."</p>

  <p>"Was there no conviction&mdash;no sentence?" Shefford felt a curious
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Naw," he snorted. "That court might have saved its breath."</p>

  <p>"I suppose. Well, Joe, between you and me, as old friends now, that trial
  established one fact, even if it couldn't be proved... Those women are sealed
  wives."</p>

  <p>Joe had no reply for that. He looked gloomy, and there was a stern line in
  his lips. To-day he seemed more like a Mormon.</p>

  <p>"Judge Stone knew that as well as I knew," went on Shefford. "Any man of
  penetration could have seen it. What an ordeal that was for good women to go
  through! I know they're good. And there they were swearing to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Didn't it make me sick?" interrupted Joe in a kind of growl. "Reckon it
  made Judge Stone sick, too. After Mary went under he conducted that trial
  like a man cuttin' out steers at a round-up. He wanted to get it over. He
  never forced any question... Bad job to ride down Stonebridge way! It's out
  of creation. There's only six men in the party, with a poor lot of horses.
  Really, government officers or not, they're not safe. And they've taken a
  hunch."</p>

  <p>"Have they left already?" inquired Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Were packed an hour ago. I didn't see them go, but somebody said they
  went. Took the trail for Bluff, which sure is the only trail they could take,
  unless they wanted to go to Colorado by way of Kayenta. That might have been
  the safest trail."</p>

  <p>"Joe, what might happen to them?" asked Shefford, quietly, with eyes on
  the Mormon.</p>

  <p>"Aw, you know that rough trail. Bad on horses. Weathered slopes&mdash;
  slipping ledges&mdash;a rock might fall on you any time. Then Shadd's here
  with his gang. And bad Piutes."</p>

  <p>"What became of the women?" Shefford asked, 'presently.</p>

  <p>"They're around among friends."</p>

  <p>"Where are their children?"</p>

  <p>"Left over there with the old women. Couldn't be fetched over. But there
  are some pretty young babies in that bunch&mdash;need their mothers."</p>

  <p>"I should&mdash;think so," replied Shefford, constrainedly. "When will
  their mothers get back to them?"</p>

  <p>"To-night, maybe, if this mob of cow-punchers and wranglers get out of
  town... It's a bad mix, Shefford, here's a hunch on that. These fellows will
  get full of whisky. And trouble might come if they&mdash;approach the
  women."</p>

  <p>"You mean they might get drunk enough to take the oaths of those poor
  women&mdash;take the meaning literally&mdash;pretend to believe the women
  what they swore they were?"</p>

  <p>"Reckon you've got the hunch," replied Joe, gloomily.</p>

  <p>"My God! man, that would be horrible!" exclaimed Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Horrible or not, it's liable to happen. The women can be kept here yet
  awhile. Reckon there won't be any trouble here. It'll be over there in the
  valley. Shefford, getting the women over there safe is a job that's been put
  to me. I've got a bunch of fellows already. Can I count on you? I'm glad to
  say you're well thought of. Bishop Kane liked you, and what he says
  goes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Joe, you can count on me," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>They finished their meal then and repaired to the big office-room of the
  house. Several groups of men were there and loud talk was going on outside.
  Shefford saw Withers talking to Bishop Kane and two other Mormons, both
  strangers to Shefford. The trader appeared to be speaking with unwonted
  force, emphasizing his words with energetic movements of his hands.</p>

  <p>"Reckon something's up," whispered Joe, hoarsely. "It's been in the air
  all day."</p>

  <p>Withers must have been watching for Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Here's Shefford now," he said to the trio of Mormons, as Joe and Shefford
  reached the group. "I want you to hear him speak for himself."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Give me a hunch and I'll put in my say-so," said Joe Lake.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, it's the matter of a good name more than a job," replied the
  trader. "A little while back I told the bishop I meant to put you on the pack
  job over to the valley&mdash;same as when you first came to me. Well, the
  bishop was pleased and said he might put something in your way. Just now I
  ran in here to find you&mdash;not wanted. When I kicked I got the straight
  hunch. Willetts has said things about you. One of them&mdash;the one that
  sticks in my craw&mdash;was that you'd do anything, even pretend to be
  inclined toward Mormonism, just to be among those Mormon women over there.
  Willetts is your enemy. And he's worse than I thought. Now I want you to tell
  Bishop Kane why this missionary is bitter toward you."</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I knocked him down," replied Shefford, simply.</p>

  <p>"What for?" inquired the bishop, in surprise and curiosity.</p>

  <p>Shefford related the incident which had occurred at Red Lake and that now
  seemed again to come forward fatefully.</p>

  <p>"You insinuate he had evil intent toward the Indian girl?" queried
  Kane.</p>

  <p>"I insinuate nothing. I merely state what led to my acting as I did."</p>

  <p>"Principles of religion, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No. A man's principles."</p>

  <p>Withers interposed in his blunt way, "Bishop, did you ever see Glen
  Naspa?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"She's the prettiest Navajo in the country. Willetts was after her, that's
  all."</p>

  <p>"My dear man, I can't believe that of a Christian missionary. We've known
  Willetts for years. He's a man of influence. He has money back of him. He's
  doing a good work. You hint of a love relation."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't hint," replied Withers, impatiently. "I know. It's not the
  first time I've known a missionary to do this sort of thing. Nor is it the
  first time for Willetts. Bishop Kane, I live among the Indians. I see a lot I
  never speak of. My work is to trade with the Indians, that's all. But I'll
  not have Willetts or any other damned hypocrite run down my friend here. John
  Shefford is the finest young man that ever came to me in the desert. And he's
  got to be put right before you all or I'll not set foot in Stonebridge again
  ... Willetts was after Glen Naspa. Shefford punched him. And later threw him
  out of the old Indian's hogan up on the mountain. That explains Willetts's
  enmity. He was after the girl."</p>

  <p>"What's more, gentlemen, he GOT her," added Shefford. "Glen Naspa has not
  been home for six months. I saw her at Blue Canyon... I would like to face
  this Willetts before you all."</p>

  <p>"Easy enough," replied Withers, with a grim chuckle. "He's just
  outside."</p>

  <p>The trader went out; Joe Lake followed at his heels and the three Mormons
  were next; Shefford brought up the rear and lingered in the door while his
  eye swept the crowd of men and Indians. His feeling was in direct contrast to
  his movements. He felt the throbbing of fierce anger. But it seemed a face
  came between him and his passion&mdash;a sweet and tragic face that would
  have had power to check him in a vastly more critical moment than this. And
  in an instant he had himself in hand, and, strangely, suddenly felt the
  strength that had come to him.</p>

  <p>Willetts stood in earnest colloquy with a short, squat Indian&mdash;the
  half-breed Shadd. They leaned against a hitching-rail. Other Indians were
  there, and outlaws. It was a mixed group, rough and hard-looking.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Willetts!" called the trader, and his loud, ringing voice, not
  pleasant, stilled the movement and sound.</p>

  <p>When Willetts turned, Shefford was half-way across the wide walk. The
  missionary not only saw him, but also Nas Ta Bega, who was striding forward.
  Joe Lake was ahead of the trader, the Mormons followed with decision, and
  they all confronted Willetts. He turned pale. Shadd had cautiously moved
  along the rail, nearer to his gang, and then they, with the others of the
  curious crowd, drew closer.</p>

  <p>"Willetts, here's Shefford. Now say it to his face!" declared the trader.
  He was angry and evidently wanted the fact known, as well as the
  situation.</p>

  <p>Willetts had paled, but he showed boldness. For an instant Shefford
  studied the smooth face, with its sloping lines, the dark, wine-colored
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Willetts, I understand you've maligned me to Bishop Kane and others,"
  began Shefford, curtly.</p>

  <p>"I called you an atheist," returned the missionary, harshly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and more than that. And I told these men WHY you vented your spite
  on me."</p>

  <p>Willetts uttered a half-laugh, an uneasy, contemptuous expression of scorn
  and repudiation.</p>

  <p>"The charges of such a man as you are can't hurt me," he said.</p>

  <p>The man did not show fear so much as disgust at the meeting. He seemed to
  be absorbed in thought, yet no serious consideration of the situation made
  itself manifest. Shefford felt puzzled. Perhaps there was no fire to strike
  from this man. The desert had certainly not made him flint. He had not toiled
  or suffered or fought.</p>

  <p>"But <i>I</i> can hurt you," thundered Shefford, with startling
  suddenness. "Here! Look at this Indian! Do you know him? Glen Naspa's
  brother. Look at him. Let us see you face him while I accuse you... You made
  love to Glen Naspa&mdash;took her from her home!"</p>

  <p>"Harping infidel!" replied Willetts, hoarsely. "So that's your game. Well,
  Glen Naspa came to my school of her own accord and she will say so."</p>

  <p>"Why will she? Because you blinded the simple Indian girl... Willetts,
  I'll waste little more time on you."</p>

  <p>And swift and light as a panther Shefford leaped upon the man and,
  fastening powerful hands round the thick neck, bore him to his knees and bent
  back his head over the rail. There was a convulsive struggle, a hard flinging
  of arms, a straining wrestle, and then Willetts was in a dreadful position.
  Shefford held him in iron grasp.</p>

  <p>"You damned, white-livered hypocrite&mdash;I'm liable to kill you!" cried
  Shefford. "I watched you and Glen Naspa that day up on the mountain. I saw
  you embrace her. I saw that she loved you. Tell THAT, you liar! That'll be
  enough."</p>

  <p>The face of the missionary turned purple as Shefford forced his head back
  over the rail.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill you, man," repeated Shefford, piercingly. "Do you want to go to
  your God unprepared? Say you made love to Glen Naspa&mdash;tell that you
  persuaded her to leave her home. Quick!"</p>

  <p>Willetts raised a shaking hand and then Shefford relaxed the paralyzing
  grip and let his head come forward. The half-strangled man gasped out a few
  incoherent words that his livid, guilty face made unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Shefford gave him a shove and he fell into the dust at the feet of the
  Navajo.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I leave him to Nas Ta Bega," said Shefford, with a strange
  change from passion to calmness.</p>

  <p>Late that night, when the roystering visitors had gone or were deep in
  drunken slumber, a melancholy and strange procession filed out of
  Stonebridge. Joe Lake and his armed comrades were escorting the Mormon women
  back to the hidden valley. They were mounted on burros and mustangs, and in
  all that dark and somber line there was only one figure which shone white
  under the pale moon.</p>

  <p>At the starting, until that white-clad figure had appeared, Shefford's
  heart had seemed to be in his throat; and thereafter its beat was muffled and
  painful in his breast. Yet there was some sad sweetness in the knowledge that
  he could see her now, be near her, watch over her.</p>

  <p>By and by the overcast clouds drifted and the moon shone bright. The night
  was still; the great dark mountain loomed to the stars; the numberless waves
  of rounded rock that must be crossed and circled lay deep in shadow. There
  was only a steady pattering of light hoofs.</p>

  <p>Shefford's place was near the end of the line, and he kept well back,
  riding close to one woman and then another. No word was spoken. These sealed
  wives rode where their mounts were led or driven, as blind in their hoods as
  veiled Arab women in palanquins. And their heads drooped wearily and their
  shoulders bent, as if under a burden. It took an hour of steady riding to
  reach the ascent to the plateau, and here, with the beginning of rough and
  smooth and shadowed trail, the work of the escort began. The line lengthened
  out and each man kept to the several women assigned to him. Shefford had
  three, and one of them was the girl he loved. She rode as if the world and
  time and life were naught to her. As soon as he dared trust his voice and his
  control he meant to let her know the man whom perhaps she had not forgotten
  was there with her, a friend. Six months! It had been a lifetime to him.
  Surely eternity to her! Had she forgotten? He felt like a coward who had
  basely deserted her. Oh&mdash;had he only known!</p>

  <p>She rode a burro that was slow, continually blocking the passage for those
  behind, and eventually it became lame. Thus the other women forged ahead.
  Shefford dismounted and stopped her burro. It was a moment before she noted
  the halt, and twice in that time Shefford tried to speak and failed. What
  poignant pain, regret, love made his utterance fail!</p>

  <p>"Ride my horse," he finally said, and his voice was not like his own.</p>

  <p>Obediently and wearily she dismounted from the burro and got up on Nack-
  yal. The stirrups were long for her and he had to change them. His fingers
  were all thumbs as he fumbled with the buckles.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he became aware that there had been a subtle change in her. He
  knew it without looking up and he seemed to be unable to go on with his task.
  If his life had depended upon keeping his head lowered he could not have done
  it. The listlessness of her drooping form was no longer manifest. The peak of
  the dark hood pointed toward him. He knew then that she was gazing at
  him.</p>

  <p>Never so long as he lived would that moment be forgotten! They were alone.
  The others had gotten so far ahead that no sound came back. The stillness was
  so deep it could be felt. The moon shone with white, cold radiance and the
  shining slopes of smooth stone waved away, crossed by shadows of pinyons.</p>

  <p>Then she leaned a little toward him. One swift hand flew up to tear the
  black hood back so that she could see. In its place flashed her white face.
  And her eyes were like the night.</p>

  <p>"YOU!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>His blood came leaping to sting neck and cheek and temple. What dared he
  interpret from that single word? Could any other word have meant so much?</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;one&mdash;else," he replied, unsteadily.</p>

  <p>Her white hand flashed again to him, and he met it with his own. He felt
  himself standing cold and motionless in the moonlight. He saw her, wonderful,
  with the deep, shadowy eyes, and a silver sheen on her hair. And as he looked
  she released her hand and lifted it, with the other, to her hood. He saw the
  shiny hair darken and disappear&mdash;and then the lovely face with its sad
  eyes and tragic lips.</p>

  <p>He drew Nack-yal's bridle forward, and led him up the moonlit trail.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII.</a> &mdash; THE REVELATION</h2>

  <p class="first">THE following afternoon cowboys and horse-wranglers,
  keen-eyed as Indians for tracks and trails, began to arrive in the quiet
  valley to which the Mormon women had been returned.</p>

  <p>Under every cedar clump there were hobbled horses, packs, and rolled
  bedding in tarpaulins. Shefford and Joe Lake had pitched camp in the old site
  near the spring. The other men of Joe's escort went to the homes of the
  women; and that afternoon, as the curious visitors began to arrive, these
  homes became barred and dark and quiet, as if they had been closed and
  deserted for the winter. Not a woman showed herself.</p>

  <p>Shefford and Joe, by reason of the location of their camp and their
  alertness, met all the new-comers. The ride from Stonebridge was a long and
  hard one, calculated to wear off the effects of the whisky imbibed by the
  adventure-seekers. This fact alone saved the situation. Nevertheless, Joe
  expected trouble. Most of the visitors were decent, good-natured fellows,
  merely curious, and simple enough to believe that this really was what the
  Mormons had claimed&mdash;a village of free women. But there were those among
  them who were coarse, evil-minded, and dangerous.</p>

  <p>By supper-time there were two dozen or more of these men in the valley,
  camped along the west wall. Fires were lighted, smoke curled up over the
  cedars, gay songs disturbed the usual serenity of the place. Later in the
  early twilight the curious visitors, by twos and threes, walked about the
  village, peering at the dark cabins and jesting among themselves. Joe had
  informed Shefford that all the women had been put in a limited number of
  cabins, so that they could be protected. So far as Shefford saw or heard
  there was no unpleasant incident in the village; however, as the sauntering
  visitors returned toward their camps they loitered at the spring, and here
  developments threatened.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that the majority of these cowboys and their comrades
  were decent-minded and beginning to see the real relation of things, they
  were not disposed to be civil to Shefford. They were certainly not Mormons.
  And his position, apparently as a Gentile, among these Mormons was one open
  to criticism. They might have been jealous, too; at any rate, remarks were
  passed in his hearing, meant for his ears, that made it exceedingly trying
  for him not to resent. Moreover, Joe Lake's increasing impatience rendered
  the situation more difficult. Shefford welcomed the arrival of Nas Ta Bega.
  The Indian listened to the loud talk of several loungers round the camp-fire;
  and thereafter he was like Shefford's shadow, silent, somber, watchful.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it did not happen to be one of the friendly and sarcastic
  cowboys that precipitated the crisis. A horse-wrangler named Hurley, a man of
  bad repute, as much outlaw as anything, took up the bantering.</p>

  <p>"Say, Shefford, what in the hell's your job here, anyway?" he queried as
  he kicked a cedar branch into the camp-fire. The brightening blaze showed him
  swarthy, unshaven, a large-featured, ugly man.</p>

  <p>"I've been doing odd jobs for Withers," replied Shefford. "Expect to drive
  pack-trains in here for a while."</p>

  <p>"You must stand strong with these Mormons. Must be a Mormon yerself?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Shefford, briefly.</p>

  <p>"Wal, I'm stuck on your job. Do you need a packer? I can throw a diamond-
  hitch better 'n any feller in this country."</p>

  <p>"I don't need help."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe you'll take me over to see the ladies," he went on, with a coarse
  laugh.</p>

  <p>Shefford did not show that he had heard. Hurley waited, leering as looked
  from the keen listeners to Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Want to have them all yerself, eh?" he jeered.</p>

  <p>Shefford struck him&mdash;sent him tumbling heavily, like a log. Hurley,
  cursing as he half rose, jerked his gun out. Nas Ta Bega, swift as light,
  kicked the gun out of his hand. And Joe Lake picked it up.</p>

  <p>Deliberately the Mormon cocked the weapon and stood over Hurley.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" he ordered, and Shefford heard the ruthless Mormon in him
  then.</p>

  <p>Hurley rose slowly. Then Joe prodded him in the middle with the cocked
  gun. Shefford startled, expected the gun to go off. So did the others,
  especially Hurley, who shrank in panic from the dark Mormon.</p>

  <p>"Rustle!" said Joe, and gave the man a harder prod. Assuredly the gun did
  not have a hair-trigger.</p>

  <p>"Joe, mebbe it's loaded!" protested one of the cowboys.</p>

  <p>Hurley shrank back, and turned to hurry away, with Joe close after him.
  They disappeared in the darkness. A constrained silence was maintained around
  the camp-fire for a while. Presently some of the men walked off and others
  began to converse. Everybody heard the sound of hoofs passing down the trail.
  The patter ceased, and in a few moments Lake returned. He still carried
  Hurley's gun.</p>

  <p>The crowd dispersed then. There was no indication of further trouble.
  However, Shefford and Joe and Nas Ta Bega divided the night in watches, so
  that some one would be wide awake.</p>

  <p>Early next morning there was an exodus from the village of the better
  element among the visitors. "No fun hangin' round hyar," one of them
  expressed it, and as good-naturedly as they had come they rode away. Six or
  seven of the desperado class remained behind, bent on mischief; and they were
  reinforced by more arrivals from Stonebridge. They avoided the camp by the
  spring, and when Shefford and Lake attempted to go to them they gave them a
  wide berth. This caused Joe to assert that they were up to some dirty work.
  All morning they lounged around under the cedars, keeping out of sight, and
  evidently the reinforcement from Stonebridge had brought liquor. When they
  gathered together at their camp, half drunk, all noisy, some wanting to
  swagger off into the village and others trying to hold them back, Joe Lake
  said, grimly, that somebody was going to get shot. Indeed, Shefford saw that
  there was every likelihood of bloodshed.</p>

  <p>"Reckon we'd better take to one of the cabins," said Joe.</p>

  <p>Thereupon the three repaired to the nearest cabin, and, entering, kept
  watch from the windows. During a couple of hours, however, they did not see
  or hear anything of the ruffians. Then came a shot from over in the village,
  a single yell, and, after that, a scattering volley. The silence and suspense
  which followed were finally broken by hoof-beats. Nas Ta Bega called Joe and
  Shefford to the window he had been stationed at. From here they saw the
  unwelcome visitors ride down the trail, to disappear in the cedars toward the
  outlet of the valley. Joe, who had numbered them, said that all but one of
  them had gone.</p>

  <p>"Reckon he got it," added Joe.</p>

  <p>So indeed it turned out; one of the men, a well-known rustler named
  Harker, had been killed, by whom no one seemed to know. He had brazenly tried
  to force his way into one of the houses, and the act had cost him his life.
  Naturally Shefford, never free from his civilized habit of thought, remarked
  apprehensively that he hoped this affair would not cause the poor women to be
  arrested again and haled before some rude court.</p>

  <p>"Law!" grunted Joe. "There ain't any. The nearest sheriff is in Durango.
  That's Colorado. And he'd give us a medal for killing Harker. It was a good
  job, for it'll teach these rowdies a lesson."</p>

  <p>Next day the old order of life was resumed in the village. And the arrival
  of a heavily laden pack-train, under the guidance of Withers, attested to the
  fact that the Mormons meant not only to continue to live in the valley, but
  also to build and plant and enlarge. This was good news to Shefford. At least
  the village could be made less lonely. And there was plenty of work to give
  him excuse for staying there. Furthermore, Withers brought a message form
  Bishop Kane to the effect that the young man was offered a place as teacher
  in the school, in co-operation with the Mormon teachers. Shefford experienced
  no twinge of conscience when he accepted.</p>

  <p>It was the fourth evening after the never-to-be-forgotten moonlight ride
  to the valley that Shefford passed under the dark pinyon-trees on his way to
  Fay Larkin's cottage. He paused in the gloom and memory beset him. The six
  months were annihilated, and it was the night he had fled. But now all was
  silent. He seemed to be trying to drag himself back. A beginning must be
  made. Only how to meet her&mdash;what to say&mdash;what to conceal!</p>

  <p>He tapped on the door and she came out. After all, it was a meeting vastly
  different from what his feeling made him imagine it might have been. She was
  nervous, frightened, as were all the other women, for that matter. She was
  alone in the cottage. He made haste to reassure her about the improbability
  of any further trouble such as had befallen the last week. As he had always
  done on those former visits to her, he talked rapidly, using all his wit, and
  here his emotion made him eloquent; he avoided personalities, except to tell
  about his prospects of work in the village, and he sought above all to lead
  her mind from thought of herself and her condition. Before he left her he had
  the gladness of knowing he had succeeded.</p>

  <p>When he said good night he felt the strange falsity of his position. He
  did not expect to be able to keep up the deception for long. That roused him,
  and half the night he lay awake, thinking. Next day he was the life of the
  work and study and play in that village. Kindness and good-will did not need
  inspiration, but it was keen, deep passion that made him a plotter for
  influence and friendship. Was there a woman in the village whom he might
  trust, in case he needed one? And his instinct guided him to her whom he had
  liked well&mdash;Ruth. Ruth Jones she had called herself at the trial, and
  when Shefford used the name she laughed mockingly. Ruth was not very
  religious, and sometimes she was bitter and hard. She wanted life, and here
  she was a prisoner in a lonely valley. She welcomed Shefford's visits. He
  imagined that she had slightly changed, and whether it was the added six
  months with its trouble and pain or a growing revolt he could not tell. After
  a time he divined that the inevitable retrogression had set in: she had not
  enough faith to uphold the burden she had accepted, nor the courage to cast
  it off. She was ready to love him. That did not frighten Shefford, and if she
  did love him he was not so sure it would not be an anchor for her. He saw her
  danger, and then he became what he had never really been in all the days of
  his ministry&mdash;the real helper. Unselfishly, for her sake, he found power
  to influence her; and selfishly, for the sake of Fay Larkin, he began slowly
  to win her to a possible need.</p>

  <p>The days passed swiftly. Mormons came and went, though in the open day, as
  laborers; new cabins went up, and a store, and other improvements. Some part
  of every evening Shefford spent with Fay, and these visits were no longer
  unknown to the village. Women gossiped, in a friendly way about Shefford, but
  with jealous tongues about the girl. Joe Lake told Shefford the run of the
  village talk. Anything concerning the Sago Lily the droll Mormon took to
  heart. He had been hard hit, and admitted it. Sometimes he went with Shefford
  to call upon her, but he talked little and never remained long. Shefford had
  anticipated antagonism on the part of Joe; however, he did not find it.</p>

  <p>Shefford really lived through the busy day for that hour with Fay in the
  twilight. And every evening seemed the same. He would find her in the dark,
  alone, silent, brooding, hopeless. Her mood did not puzzle him, but how to
  keep from plunging her deeper into despair baffled him. He exhausted all his
  powers trying to do for her what he had been able to do for Ruth. Yet he
  failed. Something had blunted her. The shadow of that baneful trial hovered
  over her, and he came to sense a strange terror in her. It was mostly always
  present. Was she thinking of Jane Withersteen and Lassiter, left dead or
  imprisoned in the valley from which she had been brought so mysteriously?
  Shefford wearied his brain revolving these questions. The fate of her
  friends, and the cross she bore&mdash;of these was tragedy born, but the
  terror&mdash;that Shefford divined came of waiting for the visit of the
  Mormon whose face she had never seen. Shefford prayed that he might never
  meet this man. Finally he grew desperate. When he first arrived at the girl's
  home she would speak, she showed gladness, relief, and then straightway she
  dropped back into the shadow of her gloom. When he got up to go then there
  was a wistfulness, an unspoken need, an unconscious reliance, in her
  reluctant good night.</p>

  <p>Then the hour came when he reached his limit. He must begin his
  revelation.</p>

  <p>"You never ask me anything&mdash;let alone about myself," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear," she replied, timidly.</p>

  <p>"Do I strike you as an unhappy man?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Well, how DO I strike you?"</p>

  <p>This was an entirely new tack he had veered to.</p>

  <p>"Very good and kind to us women," she said.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that. If I am so, it doesn't bring me happiness... Do
  you remember what I told you once, about my being a preacher&mdash; disgrace,
  ruin, and all that&mdash;and my rainbow-chasing dream out here after
  a&mdash;a lost girl?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;remember all&mdash;you said," she replied, very low.</p>

  <p>"Listen." His voice was a little husky, but behind it there seemed a tide
  of resistless utterance. "Loss of faith and name did not send me to this
  wilderness. But I had love&mdash;love for that lost girl, Fay Larkin. I
  dreamed about her till I loved her. I dreamed that I would find her&mdash; my
  treasure&mdash;at the foot of a rainbow. Dreams!... When you told me she was
  dead I accepted that. There was truth in your voice. I respected your
  reticence. But something died in me then. I lost myself, the best of me, the
  good that might have uplifted me. I went away, down upon the barren desert,
  and there I rode and slept and grew into another and a harder man. Yet,
  strange to say, I never forgot her, though my dreams were done. As I toiled
  and suffered and changed I loved her&mdash;if not her, the thought of her
  &mdash;more and more. Now I have come back to these walled valleys&mdash; to
  the smell of pinyon, to the flowers in the nooks, to the wind on the heights,
  to the silence and loneliness and beauty. And here the dreams come back and
  SHE is WITH me always. Her spirit is all that keeps me kind and good, as you
  say I am. But I suffer, I long for her alive. If I love her dead, how could I
  love her living! Always I torture myself with the vain dream that&mdash;that
  she MIGHT not be dead. I have never been anything but a dreamer. And here I
  go about my work by day and lie awake at night with that lost girl in my
  mind... I love her. Does that seem strange to you? But it would not if you
  understood. Think. I had lost faith, hope. I set myself a great work&mdash;to
  find Fay Larkin. And by the fire and the iron and the blood that I felt it
  would cost to save her some faith must come to me again ... My work is
  undone&mdash;I've never saved her. But listen, how strange it is to
  feel&mdash;now&mdash;as I let myself go&mdash;that just the loving her and
  the living here in the wildness that holds her somewhere have brought me hope
  again. Some faith must come, too. It was through her that I met this Indian,
  Nas Ta Bega. He has saved my life&mdash;taught me much. What would I ever
  have learned of the naked and vast earth, of the sublimity of the wild
  uplands, of the storm and night and sun, if I had not followed a gleam she
  inspired? In my hunt for a lost girl perhaps I wandered into a place where I
  shall find a God and my salvation. Do you marvel that I love Fay
  Larkin&mdash;that she is not dead to me? Do you marvel that I love her, when
  I KNOW, were she alive, chained in a canyon, or bound, or lost in any way, my
  destiny would lead me to her, and she should be saved?"</p>

  <p>Shefford ended, overcome with emotion. In the dusk he could not see the
  girl's face, but the white form that had drooped so listlessly seemed now
  charged by some vitalizing current. He knew he had spoken irrationally; still
  he held it no dishonor to have told her he loved her as one dead. If she took
  that love to the secret heart of living Fay Larkin, then perhaps a spirit
  might light in her darkened soul. He had no thought yet that Fay Larkin might
  ever belong to him. He divined a crime&mdash;he had seen her agony. And this
  avowal of his was only one step toward her deliverance.</p>

  <p>Softly she rose, retreating into the shadow.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me if I&mdash;I disturb you, distress you," he said. "I wanted to
  tell you. She was&mdash;somehow known to you. I am not happy. And are YOU
  happy?... Let her memory be a bond between us... Good night."</p>

  <p>"Good night."</p>

  <p>Faintly as the faintest whisper breathed her reply, and, though it came
  from a child forced into womanhood, it whispered of girlhood not dead, of
  sweet incredulity, of amazed tumult, of a wondering, frantic desire to run
  and hide, of the bewilderment incident to a first hint of love.</p>

  <p>Shefford walked away into the darkness. The whisper filled his soul. Had a
  word of love ever been spoken to that girl? Never&mdash;not the love which
  had been on his lips. Fay Larkin's lonely life spoke clearly in her
  whisper.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning as the sun gilded the looming peaks and shafts
  of gold slanted into the valley she came swiftly down the path to the
  spring.</p>

  <p>Shefford paused in his task of chopping wood. Joe Lake, on his knees, with
  his big hands in a pan of dough, lifted his head to stare. She had left off
  the somber black hood, and, although that made a vast difference in her,
  still it was not enough to account for what struck both men.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," she called, brightly.</p>

  <p>They both answered, but not spontaneously. She stopped at the spring and
  with one sweep of her strong arm filled the bucket and lifted it. Then she
  started back down the path and, pausing opposite the camp, set the bucket
  down.</p>

  <p>"Joe, do you still pride yourself on your sour dough?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I do," replied Joe, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"I've heard your boasts, but never tasted your bread," she went on.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask you to eat with us some day."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," she replied.</p>

  <p>And then shyly she looked at Shefford. She was like the fresh dawn, and
  the gold of the sun shone on her head.</p>

  <p>"Have you chopped all that wood&mdash;so early?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure," replied Shefford, laughing. "I have to get up early to keep Joe
  from doing all the camp chores."</p>

  <p>She smiled, and then to Shefford she seemed to gleam, to be radiant.</p>

  <p>"It'd be a lovely morning to climb&mdash;'way high."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes&mdash;it would," replied Shefford, awkwardly. "I wish I
  didn't have my work."</p>

  <p>"Joe, will YOU climb with me some day?"</p>

  <p>"I should smile I will," declared Joe.</p>

  <p>"But I can run right up the walls."</p>

  <p>"I reckon. Mary, it wouldn't surprise me to see you fly."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean I'm like a canyon swallow or an angel?"</p>

  <p>Then, as Joe stared speechlessly, she said good-by and, taking up the
  bucket, went on with her swift, graceful step.</p>

  <p>"She's perked up," said the Mormon, staring after her. "Never heard her
  say more 'n yes or no till now."</p>

  <p>"She did seem&mdash;bright," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>He was stunned. What had happened to her? To-day this girl had not been
  Mary, the sealed wife, or the Sago Lily, alien among Mormon women. Then it
  flashed upon him&mdash;she was Fay Larkin. She who had regarded herself as
  dead had come back to life. In one short night what had transformed her
  &mdash;what had taken place in her heart? Shefford dared not accept, nor
  allow lodgment in his mind, a thrilling idea that he had made her forget her
  misery.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, did you ever see her like that?" asked Joe.</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you&mdash;something to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I have. I&mdash;I hope so."</p>

  <p>"Reckon you've seen how she's faded&mdash;since the trial?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Shefford, swiftly. "But I've not seen her face in daylight
  since then."</p>

  <p>"Well, take my hunch," said Joe, soberly. "She's begun to fade like the
  canyon lily when it's broken. And she's going to die unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why man!" ejaculated Shefford. "Didn't you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure I see," interrupted the Mormon. "I see a lot you don't. She's so
  white you can look through her. She's grown thin, all in a week. She doesn't
  eat. Oh, I know, because I've made it my business to find out. It's no news
  to the women. But they'd like to see her die. And she will die unless
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My God!" exclaimed Shefford, huskily. "I never noticed&mdash;I never
  thought... Joe, hasn't she any friends?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. You and Ruth&mdash;and me. Maybe Nas Ta Bega, too. He watches her a
  good deal."</p>

  <p>"We can do so little, when she needs so much."</p>

  <p>"Nobody can help her, unless it's you," went on the Mormon. "That's plain
  talk. She seemed different this morning. Why, she was alive&mdash;she
  talked&mdash;she smiled... Shefford, if you cheer her up I'll go to hell for
  you!"</p>

  <p>The big Mormon, on his knees, with his hands in a pan of dough, and his
  shirt all covered with flour, presented an incongruous figure of a man
  actuated by pathos and passion. Yet the contrast made his emotion all the
  simpler and stronger. Shefford grew closer to Joe in that moment.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think <i>I</i> can cheer her, help her?" queried Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But she's different with you. It's not that you're a
  Gentile, though, for all the women are crazy about you. You talk to her. You
  have power over her, Shefford. I feel that. She's only a kid."</p>

  <p>"Who is she, Joe? Where did she come from?" asked Shefford, very low, with
  his eyes cast down.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I can't find out. Nobody knows. It's a mystery&mdash;to all
  the younger Mormons, anyway."</p>

  <p>Shefford burned to ask questions about the Mormon whose sealed wife the
  girl was, but he respected Joe too much to take advantage of him in a
  poignant moment like this. Besides, it was only jealousy that made him burn
  to know the Mormon's identity, and jealousy had become a creeping, insidious,
  growing fire. He would be wise not to add fuel to it. He rejected many things
  before he thought of one that he could voice to his friend.</p>

  <p>"Joe, it's only her body that belongs to&mdash;to... Her soul is lost
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"John Shefford, let that go. My mind's tired. I've been taught so and so,
  and I'm not bright... But, after all, men are much alike. The thing with you
  and me is this&mdash;we don't want to see HER grave!"</p>

  <p>Love spoke there. The Mormon had seized upon the single elemental point
  that concerned him and his friend in their relation to this unfortunate girl.
  His simple, powerful statement united them; it gave the lie to his hint of
  denseness; it stripped the truth naked. It was such a wonderful thought-
  provoking statement that Shefford needed time to ponder how deep the Mormon
  was. To what limit would he go? Did he mean that here, between two men who
  loved the same girl, class, duty, honor, creed were nothing if they stood in
  the way of her deliverance and her life?</p>

  <p>"Joe Lake, you Mormons are impossible," said Shefford, deliberately. "You
  don't want to see her grave. So long as she lives&mdash;remains on the
  earth&mdash;white and gold like the flower you call her, that's enough for
  you. It's her body you think of. And that's the great and horrible error in
  your religion... But death of the soul is infinitely worse than death of the
  body. I have been thinking of her soul... So here we stand, you and I. You to
  save her life&mdash;I to save her soul! What will you do?"</p>

  <p>"Why, John, I'd turn Gentile," he said, with terrible softness. It was a
  softness that scorned Shefford for asking, and likewise it flung defiance at
  his creed and into the face of hell.</p>

  <p>Shefford felt the sting and the exaltation.</p>

  <p>"And I'd be a Mormon," he said.</p>

  <p>"All right. We understand each other. Reckon there won't be any call for
  such extremes. I haven't an idea what you mean&mdash;what can be done. But I
  say, go slow, so we won't all find graves. First cheer her up somehow. Make
  her want to live. But go slow, John. AND DON'T BE WITH HER LATE!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT night Shefford found her waiting for him in the
  moonlight&mdash;a girl who was as transparent as crystal-clear water, who had
  left off the somber gloom with the black hood, who tremulously embraced
  happiness without knowing it, who was one moment timid and wild like a
  half-frightened fawn, and the next, exquisitely half-conscious of what it
  meant to be thought dead, but to be alive, to be awakening, wondering,
  palpitating, and to be loved.</p>

  <p>Shefford lived the hour as a dream and went back to the quiet darkness
  under the cedars to lie wide-eyed, trying to recall all that she had said.
  For she had talked as if utterance had long been dammed behind a barrier of
  silence.</p>

  <p>There followed other hours like that one, indescribable hours, so sweet
  they stung, and in which, keeping pace with his love, was the nobler stride
  of a spirit that more every day lightened her burden.</p>

  <p>The thing he had to do, sooner or later, was to tell her he knew she was
  Fay Larkin, not dead, but alive, and that, not love nor religion, but
  sacrifice, nailed her down to her martyrdom. Many and many a time he had
  tried to force himself to tell her, only to fail. He hated to risk ending
  this sweet, strange, thoughtless, girlish mood of hers. It might not be soon
  won back&mdash;perhaps never. How could he tell what chains bound her? And so
  as he vacillated between Joe's cautious advice to go slow and his own pity
  the days and weeks slipped by.</p>

  <p>One haunting fear kept him sleepless half the nights and sick even in his
  dreams, and it was that the Mormon whose sealed wife she was might come,
  surely would come, some night. Shefford could bear it. But what would that
  visit do to Fay Larkin? Shefford instinctively feared the awakening in the
  girl of womanhood, of deeper insight, of a spiritual realization of what she
  was, of a physical dawn.</p>

  <p>He might have spared himself needless torture. One day Joe Lake eyed him
  with penetrating glance.</p>

  <p>"Reckon you don't have to sleep right on that Stonebridge trail," said the
  Mormon, significantly.</p>

  <p>Shefford felt the blood burn his neck and face. He had pulled his
  tarpaulin closer to the trail, and his motive was as an open page to the keen
  Mormon.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"There won't be any Mormons riding in here soon&mdash;by night&mdash; to
  visit the women," replied Joe, bluntly. "Haven't you figured there might be
  government spies watching the trails?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't."</p>

  <p>"Well, take a hunch, then," added the Mormon, gruffly, and Shefford
  divined, as well as if he had been told, that warning word had gone to
  Stonebridge. Gone despite the fact that Nas Ta Bega had reported every trail
  free of watchers! There was no sign of any spies, cowboys, outlaws, or
  Indians in the vicinity of the valley. A passionate gratitude to the Mormon
  overcame Shefford; and the unreasonableness of it, the nature of it,
  perturbed him greatly. But, something hammered into his brain, if he loved
  one of these sealed wives, how could he help being jealous?</p>

  <p>The result of Joe's hint was that Shefford put off the hour of revelation,
  lived in his dream, helped the girl grow farther and farther away from her
  trouble, until that inevitable hour arrived when he was driven by accumulated
  emotion as much as the exigency of the case.</p>

  <p>He had not often walked with her beyond the dark shade of the pinyons
  round the cottage, but this night, when he knew he must tell her, he led her
  away down the path, through the cedar grove to the west end of the valley
  where it was wild and lonely and sad and silent.</p>

  <p>The moon was full and the great peaks were crowned as with snow. A coyote
  uttered his cutting cry. There were a few melancholy notes from a night bird
  of the stone walls. The air was clear and cold, with a tang of frost in it.
  Shefford gazed about him at the vast, uplifted, insulating walls, and that
  feeling of his which was more than a sense told him how walls like these and
  the silence and shadow and mystery had been nearly all of Fay Larkin's life.
  He felt them all in her.</p>

  <p>He stopped out in the open, near the line where dark shadow of the wall
  met the silver moonlight on the grass, and here, by a huge flat stone where
  he had come often alone and sometimes with Ruth, he faced Fay Larkin in the
  spirit to tell her gently that he knew her, and sternly to force her secret
  from her.</p>

  <p>"Am I your friend?" he began.</p>

  <p>"Ah!&mdash;my only friend," she said.</p>

  <p>"Do you trust me, believe I mean well by you, want to help you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, let me speak of you. You know one topic we've never touched
  upon. You!"</p>

  <p>She was silent, and looked wonderingly, a little fearfully, at him, as if
  vague, disturbing thoughts were entering the fringe of her mind.</p>

  <p>"Our friendship is a strange one, is it not?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"How do I know? I never had any other friendship. What do you mean by
  strange?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm a young man. You're a&mdash;a married woman. We are together a
  good deal&mdash;and like to be."</p>

  <p>"Why is that strange?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Shefford realized that there was nothing strange in what was
  natural. A remnant of sophistication clung to him and that had spoken. He
  needed to speak to her in a way which in her simplicity she would
  understand.</p>

  <p>"Never mind strange. Say that I am interested in you, and, as you're not
  happy, I want to help you. And say that your neighbors are curious and oppose
  my idea. Why do they?"</p>

  <p>"They're jealous and want you themselves," she replied, with sweet
  directness. "They've said things I don't understand. But I felt they&mdash;
  they hated in me what would be all right in themselves."</p>

  <p>Here to simplicity she added truth and wisdom, as an Indian might have
  expressed them. But shame was unknown to her, and she had as yet only vague
  perceptions of love and passion. Shefford began to realize the quickness of
  her mind, that she was indeed awakening.</p>

  <p>"They are jealous&mdash;were jealous before I ever came here. That's only
  human nature. I was trying to get to a point. Your neighbors are curious.
  They oppose me. They hate you. It's all bound up in the&mdash;the fact of
  your difference from them, your youth, beauty, that you're not a Mormon, that
  you nearly betrayed their secret at the trial in Stonebridge."</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;please don't&mdash;speak of that!" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"But I must," he replied, swiftly. "That trial was a torture to you. It
  revealed so much to me... I know you are a sealed wife. I know there has been
  a crime. I know you've sacrificed yourself. I know that love and religion
  have nothing to do with&mdash;what you are... Now, is not all that true?"</p>

  <p>"I must not tell," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"But I shall MAKE you tell," he replied, and his voice rang.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, you cannot," she said.</p>

  <p>"I can&mdash;with just one word!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were great, starry, shadowy gulfs, dark in the white beauty of
  her face. She was calm now. She had strength. She invited him to speak the
  word, and the wistful, tremulous quiver of her lips was for his earnest
  thought of her.</p>

  <p>"Wait&mdash;a&mdash;little," said Shefford, unsteadily. "I'll come to that
  presently. Tell me this&mdash;have you ever thought of being free?"</p>

  <p>"Free!" she echoed, and there was singular depth and richness in her
  voice. That was the first spark of fire he had struck from her. "Long ago,
  the minute I was unwatched, I'd have leaped from a wall had I dared. Oh, I
  wasn't afraid. I'd love to die that way. But I never dared."</p>

  <p>"Why?" queried Shefford, piercingly.</p>

  <p>She was silent then.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I offered to give you freedom that meant life?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;couldn't&mdash;take it."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my friend, don't ask me any more."</p>

  <p>"I know, I can see&mdash;you want to tell me&mdash;you need to tell."</p>

  <p>"But I daren't."</p>

  <p>"Won't you trust me?"</p>

  <p>"I do&mdash;I do."</p>

  <p>"Then tell me."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;oh no!"</p>

  <p>The moment had come. How sad, tragic, yet glorious for him! It would be
  like a magic touch upon this lovely, cold, white ghost of Fay Larkin,
  transforming her into a living, breathing girl. He held his love as a thing
  aloof, and, as such, intangible because of the living death she believed she
  lived, it had no warmth and intimacy for them. What might it not become with
  a lightning flash of revelation? He dreaded, yet he was driven to speak. He
  waited, swallowing hard, fighting the tumultuous storm of emotion, and his
  eyes dimmed.</p>

  <p>"What did I come to this country for?" he asked, suddenly, in ringing,
  powerful voice.</p>

  <p>"To find a girl," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I've found her!"</p>

  <p>She began to shake. He saw a white hand go to her breast.</p>

  <p>"Where is Surprise Valley?... How were you taken from Jane Withersteen and
  Lassiter?... I know they're alive. But where?"</p>

  <p>She seemed to turn to stone.</p>

  <p>"Fay!&mdash;FAY LARKIN!... I KNOW YOU!" he cried, brokenly.</p>

  <p>She slipped off the stone to her knees, swayed forward blindly with her
  hands reaching out, her head falling back to let the moon fall full upon the
  beautiful, snow-white, tragically convulsed face.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII.</a> &mdash; THE STORY OF SURPRISE VALLEY</h2>

  <p class="first">"...OH, I remember so well! Even now I dream of it
  sometimes. I hear the roll and crash of falling rock&mdash;like thunder... We
  rode and rode. Then the horses fell. Uncle Jim took me in his arms and
  started up the cliff. Mother Jane climbed close after us. They kept looking
  back. Down there in the gray valley carne the Mormons. I see the first one
  now. He rode a white horse. That was Tull. Oh, I remember so well! And I was
  five or six years old.</p>

  <p>"We climbed up and up and into dark canyon and wound in and out. Then
  there was the narrow white trail, straight up, with the little cut steps and
  the great, red, ruined walls. I looked down over Uncle Jim's shoulder. I saw
  Mother Jane dragging herself up. Uncle Jim's blood spotted the trail. He
  reached a flat place at the top and fell with me. Mother Jane crawled up to
  us.</p>

  <p>"Then she cried out and pointed. Tull was 'way below, climbing the trail.
  His men came behind him. Uncle Jim went to a great, tall rock and leaned
  against it. There was a bloody hole in his hand. He pushed the rock. It
  rolled down, banging the loose walls. They crashed and crashed&mdash;then all
  was terrible thunder and red smoke. I couldn't hear&mdash;I couldn't see.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Jim carried me down and down out of the dark and dust into a
  beautiful valley all red and gold, with a wonderful arch of stone over the
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember well what happened then for what seemed a long, long
  time. I can feel how the place looked, but not so clear as it is now in my
  dreams. I seem to see myself with the dogs, and with Mother Jane, learning my
  letters, marking with red stone on the walls.</p>

  <p>"But I remember now how I felt when I first understood we were shut in for
  ever. Shut in Surprise Valley where Venters had lived so long. I was glad.
  The Mormons would never get me. I was seven or eight years old then. From
  that time all is clear in my mind.</p>

  <p>"Venters had left supplies and tools and grain and cattle and burros, so
  we had a good start to begin life there. He had killed off the wildcats and
  kept the coyotes out, so the rabbits and quail multiplied till there were
  thousands of them. We raised corn and fruit, and stored what we didn't use.
  Mother Jane taught me to read and write with the soft red stone that marked
  well on the walls.</p>

  <p>"The years passed. We kept track of time pretty well. Uncle Jim's hair
  turned white and Mother Jane grew gray. Every day was like the one before.
  Mother Jane cried sometimes and Uncle Jim was sad because they could never be
  able to get me out of the valley. It was long before they stopped looking and
  listening for some one. Venters would come back, Uncle Jim always said. But
  Mother Jane did not think so.</p>

  <p>"I loved Surprise Valley. I wanted to stay there always. I remembered
  Cottonwoods, how the children there hated me, and I didn't want to go back.
  The only unhappy times I ever had in the valley were when Ring and Whitie, my
  dogs, grew old and died. I roamed the valley. I climbed to every nook upon
  the mossy ledges. I learned to run up the steep cliffs. I could almost stick
  on the straight walls. Mother Jane called me a wild girl. We had put away the
  clothes we wore when we got there, to save them, and we made clothes of
  skins. I always laughed when I thought of my little dress&mdash;how I grew
  out of it. I think Uncle Jim and Mother Jane talked less as the years went
  by. And after I'd learned all she could teach me we didn't talk much. I used
  to scream into the caves just to hear my voice, and the echoes would frighten
  me.</p>

  <p>"The older I grew the more I was alone. I was always running round the
  valley. I would climb to a high place and sit there for hours, doing nothing.
  I just watched and listened. I used to stay in the cliff-dwellers' caves and
  wonder about them. I loved to be out in the wind. And my happiest time was in
  the summer storms with the thunder echoes under the walls. At evening it was
  such a quiet place&mdash;after the night bird's cry, no sound. The quiet made
  me sad but I loved it. I loved to watch the stars as I lay awake.</p>

  <p>"So it was beautiful and happy for me there till&mdash;till...</p>

  <p>"Two years or more ago there was a bad storm, and one of the great walls
  caved. The walls were always weathering, slipping. Many and many a time have
  I heard the rumble of an avalanche, but most of them were in other canyon.
  This slide in the valley made it possible, Uncle Jim said, for men to get
  down into the valley. But we could not climb out unless helped from above.
  Uncle Jim never rested well after that. But it never worried me.</p>

  <p>"One day, over a year ago, while I was across the valley, I heard strange
  shouts, and then screams. I ran to our camp. I came upon men with ropes and
  guns. Uncle Jim was tied, and a rope was round his neck. Mother Jane was
  lying on the ground. I thought she was dead until I heard her moan. I was not
  afraid. I screamed and flew at Uncle Jim to tear the ropes off him. The men
  held me back. They called me a pretty cat. Then they talked together, and
  some were for hanging Lassiter&mdash;that was the first time I ever knew any
  name for him but Uncle Jim&mdash;and some were for leaving him in the valley.
  Finally they decided to hang him. But Mother Jane pleaded so and I screamed
  and fought so that they left off. Then they went away and we saw them climb
  out of the valley.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Jim said they were Mormons, and some among them had been born in
  Cottonwoods. I was not told why they had such a terrible hate for him. He
  said they would come back and kill him. Uncle Jim had no guns to fight
  with.</p>

  <p>"We watched and watched. In five days they did come back, with more men,
  and some of them wore black masks. They came to our cave with ropes and guns.
  One was tall. He had a cruel voice. The others ran to obey him. I could see
  white hair and sharp eyes behind the mask. The men caught me and brought me
  before him.</p>

  <p>"He said Lassiter had killed many Mormons. He said Lassiter had killed his
  father and should be hanged. But Lassiter would be let live and Mother Jane
  could stay with him, both prisoners there in the valley, if I would marry the
  Mormon. I must marry him, accept the Mormon faith, and bring up my children
  as Mormons. If I refused they would hang Lassiter, leave the heretic Jane
  Withersteen alone in the valley, and take me and break me to their rule.</p>

  <p>"I agreed. But Mother Jane absolutely forbade me to marry him. Then the
  Mormons took me away. It nearly killed me to leave Uncle Jim and Mother Jane.
  I was carried and lifted out of the valley, and rode a long way on a horse.
  They brought me here, to the cabin where I live, and I have never been away
  except that&mdash;that time&mdash;to&mdash;Stonebridge. Only little by little
  did I learn my position. Bishop Kane was kind, but stern, because I could not
  be quick to learn the faith.</p>

  <p>"I am not a sealed wife. But they're trying to make me one. The master
  Mormon&mdash;he visited me often&mdash;at night&mdash;till lately. He
  threatened me. He never told me a name&mdash;except Saint George. I don't
  &mdash;know him&mdash;except his voice. I never&mdash;saw his face &mdash;in
  the light!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">FAY LARKIN ended her story. Toward its close Shefford had
  grown involuntarily restless, and when her last tragic whisper ceased all his
  body seemed shaken with a terrible violence of his joy. He strode to and fro
  in the dark shadow of the stone. The receding blood left him cold, with a
  pricking, sickening sensation over his body, but there seemed to be an
  overwhelming tide accumulating deep in his breast&mdash;a tide of passion and
  pain. He dominated the passion, but the ache remained. And he returned to the
  quiet figure on the stone.</p>

  <p>"Fay Larkin!" he exclaimed, with a deep breath of relief that the secret
  was disclosed. "So you're not a wife!... You're free! Thank Heaven! But I
  felt it was sacrifice. I knew there had been a crime. For crime it is. You
  child! You can't understand what crime. Oh, almost I wish you and Jane and
  Lassiter had never been found. But that's wrong of me. One year of agony
  &mdash;that shall not ruin your life. Fay, I will take you away."</p>

  <p>"Where?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Away from this Mormon country&mdash;to the East," he replied, and he
  spoke of what he had known, of travel, of cities, of people, of happiness
  possible for a young girl who had spent all her life hidden between the
  narrow walls of a silent, lonely valley&mdash;he spoke swiftly and eloquently
  till he lost his breath.</p>

  <p>There was an instant of flashing wonder and joy on her white face, and
  then the radiance paled, the glow died. Her soul was the darker for that one
  strange, leaping glimpse of a glory not for such as she.</p>

  <p>"I must stay here," she said, shudderingly.</p>

  <p>"Fay!&mdash;How strange to SAY Fay aloud to YOU!&mdash;Fay, do you know
  the way to Surprise Valley?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know where it is, but I could go straight to it," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Take me there. Show me your beautiful valley. Let me see where you ran
  and climbed and spent so many lonely years."</p>

  <p>"Ah, how I'd love to! But I dare not. And why should you want me to take
  you? We can run and climb here."</p>

  <p>"I want to&mdash;I mean to save Jane Withersteen and Lassiter," he
  declared.</p>

  <p>She uttered a little cry of pain. "Save them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, save them. Get them out of the valley, take them out of the country,
  far away where they and YOU&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I can't go," she wailed. "I'm afraid. I'm bound. It CAN'T be broken.
  If I dared&mdash;if I tried to go they would catch me. They would hang Uncle
  Jim and leave Mother Jane alone there to starve."</p>

  <p>"Fay, Lassiter and Jane both will starve&mdash;at least they will die
  there if we do not save them. You have been terribly wronged. You're a slave.
  You're not a wife."</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;said I'll be burned in hell if I don't marry him... Mother
  Jane never taught me about God. I don't know. But HE&mdash;he said God was
  there. I dare not break it."</p>

  <p>"Fay, you have been deceived by old men. Let them have their creed. But
  YOU mustn't accept it."</p>

  <p>"John, what is God to you?"</p>

  <p>"Dear child, I&mdash;I am not sure of that myself," he replied, huskily.
  "When all this trouble is behind us, surely I can help you to understand and
  you can help me. The fact that you are alive&mdash;that Lassiter and Jane are
  alive&mdash;that I shall save you all&mdash;that lifts me up. I tell
  you&mdash;Fay Larkin will be my salvation."</p>

  <p>"Your words trouble me. Oh, I shall be torn one way and another... But,
  John, I daren't run away. I will not tell you where to find Lassiter and
  Mother Jane."</p>

  <p>"I shall find them&mdash;I have the Indian. He found you for me. Nas Ta
  Bega will find Surprise Valley."</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega!... Oh, I remember. There was an Indian with the Mormons who
  found us. But he was a Piute."</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega never told me how he learned about you. That he learned was
  enough. And, Fay, he will find Surprise Valley. He will save Uncle Jim and
  Mother Jane."</p>

  <p>Fay's hands clasped Shefford's in strong, trembling pressure; the tears
  streamed down her white cheeks; a tragic and eloquent joy convulsed her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my friend, save them! But I can't go... Let them keep me! Let him
  kill me!"</p>

  <p>"Him! Fay&mdash;he shall not harm you," replied Shefford in passionate
  earnestness.</p>

  <p>She caught the hand he had struck out with.</p>

  <p>"You talk&mdash;you look like Uncle Jim when he spoke of the Mormons," she
  said. "Then I used to be afraid of him. He was so different. John, you must
  not do anything about me. Let me be. It's too late. He&mdash;and his
  men&mdash;they would hang you. And I couldn't bear that. I've enough to bear
  without losing my friend. Say you won't watch and wait&mdash;for &mdash;for
  him."</p>

  <p>Shefford had to promise her. Like an Indian she gave expression to
  primitive feeling, for it certainly never occurred to her that, whatever
  Shefford might do, he was not the kind of man to wait in hiding for an enemy.
  Fay had faltered through her last speech and was now weak and nervous and
  frightened. Shefford took her back to the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Fay, don't be distressed," he said. "I won't do anything right away. You
  can trust me. I won't be rash. I'll consult you before I make a move. I
  haven't any idea what I could do, anyway... You must bear up. Why, it looks
  as if you're sorry I found you."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I'm glad!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Then if you're glad you mustn't break down this way again. Suppose some
  of the women happened to run into us."</p>

  <p>"I won't again. It's only you&mdash;you surprised me so. I used to think
  how I'd like you to know&mdash;I wasn't really dead. But now&mdash;it's
  different. It hurts me here. Yet I'm glad&mdash;if my being alive makes you
  &mdash;a little happier."</p>

  <p>Shefford felt that he had to go then. He could not trust himself any
  further.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Fay," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good night, John," she whispered. "I promise&mdash;to be good to-
  morrow."</p>

  <p>She was crying softly when he left her. Twice he turned to see the dim,
  white, slender form against the gloom of the cabin. Then he went on under the
  pinyons, blindly down the path, with his heart as heavy as lead. That night
  as he rolled in his blanket and stretched wearily he felt that he would never
  be able to sleep. The wind in the cedars made him shiver. The great stars
  seemed relentless, passionless, white eyes, mocking his little destiny and
  his pain. The huge shadow of the mountain resembled the shadow of the
  insurmountable barrier between Fay and him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">HER pitiful, childish promise to be good was in his mind
  when he went to her home on the next night. He wondered how she would be, and
  he realized a desperate need of self-control.</p>

  <p>But that night Fay Larkin was a different girl. In the dark, before she
  spoke, he felt a difference that afforded him surprise and relief. He greeted
  her as usual. And then it seemed, though not at all clearly, that he was
  listening to a girl, strangely and unconsciously glad to see him, who spoke
  with deeper note in her voice, who talked where always she had listened,
  whose sadness was there under an eagerness, a subdued gaiety as new to her,
  as sweet as it was bewildering. And he responded with emotion, so that the
  hour passed swiftly, and he found himself back in camp, in a kind of dream,
  unable to remember much of what she had said, sure only of this strange
  sweetness suddenly come to her.</p>

  <p>Upon the following night, however, he discovered what had wrought this
  singular change in Fay Larkin. She loved him and she did not know it. How
  passionately sweet and sad and painful was that realization for Shefford! The
  hour spent with her then was only a moment.</p>

  <p>He walked under the stars that night and they shed a glorious light upon
  him. He tried to think, to plan, but the sweetness of remembered word or look
  made mental effort almost impossible. He got as far as the thought that he
  would do well to drift, to wait till she learned she loved him, and then,
  perhaps, she could be persuaded to let him take her and Lassiter and Jane
  away together.</p>

  <p>And from that night he went at his work and the part he played in the
  village with a zeal and a cunning that left him free to seek Fay when he
  chose.</p>

  <p>Sometimes in the afternoon, always for a while in the evening, he was with
  her. They climbed the walls, and sat upon a lonely height to look afar; they
  walked under the stars, and the cedars, and the shadows of the great cliffs.
  She had a beautiful mind. Listening to her, he imagined he saw down into
  beautiful Surprise Valley with all its weird shadows, its colored walls and
  painted caves, its golden shafts of morning light and the red haze at sunset;
  and he felt the silence that must have been there, and the singing of the
  wind in the cliffs, and the sweetness and fragrance of the flowers, and the
  wildness of it all. Love had worked a marvelous transformation in this girl
  who had lived her life in a canyon. The burden upon her did not weigh
  heavily. She could not have an unhappy thought. She spoke of the village, of
  her Mormon companions, of daily happenings, of Stonebridge, of many things in
  a matter-of- fact way that showed how little they occupied her mind. She even
  spoke of sealed wives in a kind of dreamy abstraction. Something had
  possession of her, something as strong as the nature which had developed her,
  and in its power she, in her simplicity, was utterly unconscious, a watching
  and feeling girl. A strange, witching, radiant beauty lurked in her smile.
  And Shefford heard her laugh in his dreams.</p>

  <p>The weeks slipped by. The black mountain took on a white cap of snow; in
  the early mornings there was ice in the crevices on the heights and frost in
  the valley. In the sheltered canyon where sunshine seemed to linger it was
  warm and pleasant, so that winter did not kill the flowers.</p>

  <p>Shefford waited so long for Fay's awakening that he believed it would
  never come, and, believing, had not the heart to force it upon her. Then
  there was a growing fear with him. What would Fay Larkin do when she awakened
  to the truth? Fay was indeed like that white and fragile lily which bloomed
  in the silent, lonely canyon, but the same nature that had created it had
  created her. Would she droop as the lily would in a furnace blast? More than
  that, he feared a sudden flashing into life of strength, power, passion,
  hate. She did not hate yet because she did not yet realize love. She was
  utterly innocent of any wrong having been done her. More and more he began to
  fear, and a foreboding grew upon him. He made up his mind to broach the
  subject of Surprise Valley and of escaping with Lassiter and Jane; still,
  every time he was with Fay the girl and her beauty and her love were so
  wonderful that he put off the ordeal till the next night. As time flew by he
  excused his vacillation on the score that winter was not a good time to try
  to cross the desert. There was no grass for the mustangs, except in
  well-known valleys, and these he must shun. Spring would soon come. So the
  days passed, and he loved Fay more all the time, desperately living out to
  its limit the sweetness of every moment with her, and paying for his bliss in
  the increasing trouble that beset him when once away from her charm.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">ONE starry night, about ten o'clock, he went, as was his
  custom, to drink at the spring. Upon his return to the cedars Nas Ta Bega,
  who slept under the same tree with him, had arisen, with his blanket hanging
  half off his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said the Indian.</p>

  <p>Shefford took one glance at the dark, somber face, with its inscrutable
  eyes, now so strange and piercing, and then, with a kind of cold excitement,
  he faced the way the Indian looked, and listened. But he heard only the soft
  moan of the night wind in the cedars.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega kept the rigidity of his position for a moment, and then he
  relaxed, and stood at ease. Shefford knew the Indian had made a certainty of
  what must have been a doubtful sound. And Shefford leaned his ear to the wind
  and strained his hearing.</p>

  <p>Then the soft night breeze brought a faint patter&mdash;the slow trot of
  horses on a hard trail. Some one was coming into the village at a late hour.
  Shefford thought of Joe Lake. But Joe lay right behind him, asleep in his
  blankets. It could not be Withers, for the trader was in Durango at that
  time. Shefford thought of Willetts and Shadd.</p>

  <p>"Who's coming?" he asked low of the Indian.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega pointed down the trail without speaking.</p>

  <p>Shefford peered through the white dim haze of starlight and presently he
  made out moving figures. Horses, with riders&mdash;a string of them&mdash;
  one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;and he counted up to
  eleven. Eleven horsemen riding into the village! He was amazed, and suddenly
  keenly anxious. This visit might be one of Shadd's raids.</p>

  <p>"Shadd's gang!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"No, Bi Nai," replied Nas Ta Bega, and he drew Shefford farther into the
  shade of the cedars. His voice, his action, the way he kept a hand on
  Shefford's shoulder, all this told much to the young man.</p>

  <p>Mormons come on a night visit! Shefford realized it with a slight shock.
  Then swift as a lightning flash he was rent by another shock&mdash;one that
  brought cold moisture to his brow and to his heart a flame of hell.</p>

  <p>He was shaking when he sank down to find the support of a log. Like a
  shadow the Indian silently moved away. Shefford watched the eleven horses
  pass the camp, go down the road, to disappear in the village. They vanished,
  and the soft clip-clops of hoofs died away. There was nothing left to prove
  he had not dreamed.</p>

  <p>Nothing to prove it except this sudden terrible demoralization of his
  physical and spiritual being! While he peered out into the valley, toward the
  black patch of cedars and pinyons that hid the cabins, moments and moments
  passed, and in them he was gripped with cold and fire.</p>

  <p>Was the Mormon who had abducted Fay&mdash;the man with the cruel voice
  &mdash;was he among those eleven horsemen? He might not have been. What a
  torturing hope! But vain&mdash;vain, for inevitably he must be among them. He
  was there in the cabin already. He had dismounted, tied his horse, had
  knocked on her door. Did he need to knock? No, he would go in, he would call
  her in that cruel voice, and then...</p>

  <p>Shefford pulled a blanket from his bed and covered his cold and trembling
  body. He had sunk down off the log, was leaning back upon it. The stars were
  pale, far off, and the valley seemed unreal. He found himself listening
  &mdash;listening with sick and terrible earnestness, trying to hear against
  the thrum and beat of his heart, straining to catch a sound in all that cold,
  star- blanched, silent valley. But he could hear no sound. It was as if death
  held the valley in its perfect silence. How he hated that silence! There
  ought to have been a million horrible, bellowing demons making the night
  hideous. Did the stars serenely look down upon the lonely cabins of these
  exiles? Was there no thunderbolt to drop down from that dark and looming
  mountain upon the silent cabin where tragedy had entered? In all the world,
  under the sea, in the abysmal caves, in the vast spaces of the air, there was
  no such terrible silence as this. A scream, a long cry, a moan&mdash;these
  were natural to a woman, and why did not one of these sealed wives, why did
  not Fay Larkin, damn this everlasting acquiescent silence? Perhaps she would
  fly out of her cabin, come running along the path. Shefford peered into the
  bright patches of starlight and into the shadows of the cedars. But he saw no
  moving form in the open, no dim white shape against the gloom. And he heard
  no sound&mdash;not even a whisper of wind in the branches overhead.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega returned to the shade of the cedars and, lying down on his
  blankets, covered himself and went to sleep. The fact seemed to bring bitter
  reality to Shefford. Nothing was going to happen. The valley was to be the
  same this night as any other night. Shefford accepted the truth. He
  experienced a kind of self-pity. The night he had thought so much about,
  prepared for, and had forgotten had now arrived. Then he threw another
  blanket round him, and, cold, dark, grim, he faced that lonely vigil, meaning
  to sit there, wide-eyed, to endure and to wait.</p>

  <p>Jealousy and pain, following his frenzy, abided with him long hours, and
  when they passed he divined that selfishness passed with them. What he
  suffered then was for Fay Larkin and for her sisters in misfortune. He grew
  big enough to pity these fanatics. The fiery, racing tide of blood that had
  made of him only an animal had cooled with thought of others. Still he feared
  that stultifying thing which must have been hate. What a tempest had raged
  within him! This blood of his, that had received a stronger strain from his
  desert life, might in a single moment flood out reason and intellect and make
  him a vengeful man. So in those starlit hours that dragged interminably he
  looked deep into his heart and tried to fortify himself against a dark and
  evil moment to come.</p>

  <p>Midnight&mdash;and the valley seemed a tomb! Did he alone keep wakeful?
  The sky was a darker blue, the stars burned a whiter fire, the peaks stood
  looming and vast, tranquil sentinels of that valley, and the wind rose to
  sigh, to breathe, to mourn through the cedars. It was a sad music. The Indian
  lay prone, dark face to the stars. Joe Lake lay prone, sleeping as quietly,
  with his dark face exposed to the starlight. The gentle movement of the cedar
  branches changed the shape of the bright patches on the grass where shadow
  and light met. The walls of the valley waved upward, dark below and growing
  paler, to shine faintly at the rounded rims. And there was a tiny, silvery
  tinkle of running water over stones.</p>

  <p>Here was a little nook of the vast world. Here were tranquillity, beauty,
  music, loneliness, life. Shefford wondered&mdash;did he alone keep watchful?
  Did he feel that he could see dark, wide eyes peering into the gloom? And it
  came to him after a time that he was not alone in his vigil, nor was Fay
  Larkin alone in her agony. There was some one else in the valley, a great and
  breathing and watchful spirit. It entered into Shefford's soul and he
  trembled. What had come to him? And he answered&mdash;only added pain and new
  love, and a strange strength from the firmament and the peaks and the silence
  and the shadows.</p>

  <p>The bright belt with its three radiant stars sank behind the western wall
  and there was a paler gloom upon the valley.</p>

  <p>Then a few lights twinkled in the darkness that enveloped the cabins; a
  woman's laugh strangely broke the silence, profaning it, giving the lie to
  that somber yoke which seemed to consist of the very shadows; the voices of
  men were heard, and then the slow clip-clop of trotting horses on the hard
  trail.</p>

  <p>Shefford saw the Mormons file out into the paling starlight, ride down the
  valley, and vanish in the gray gloom. He was aware that the Indian sat up to
  watch the procession ride by, and that Joe turned over, as if disturbed.</p>

  <p>One by one the stars went out. The valley became a place of gray shadows.
  In the east a light glowed. Shefford sat there, haggard and worn, watching
  the coming of the dawn, the kindling of the light; and had the power been his
  the dawn would never have broken and the rose and gold never have tipped the
  lofty peaks.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">SHEFFORD attended to his camp chores as usual. Several times
  he was aware of Joe's close scrutiny, and finally, without looking at him,
  Shefford told of the visit of the Mormons. A violent expulsion of breath was
  Joe's answer and it might have been a curse. Straightway Joe ceased his
  cheery whistling and became as somber as the Indian. The camp was silent; the
  men did not look at one another. While they sat at breakfast Shefford's back
  was turned toward the village&mdash;he had not looked in that direction since
  dawn.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" suddenly exclaimed Nas Ta Bega.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake muttered low and deep, and this time there was no mistake about
  the nature of his speech. Shefford did not have the courage to turn to see
  what had caused these exclamations. He knew since today had dawned that there
  was calamity in the air.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, I reckon if I know women there's a little hell coming to you,"
  said the Mormon, significantly.</p>

  <p>Shefford wheeled as if a powerful force had turned him on a pivot. He saw
  Fay Larkin. She seemed to be almost running. She was unhooded and her bright
  hair streamed down. Her swift, lithe action was without its usual grace. She
  looked wild, and she almost fell crossing the stepping-stones of the
  brook.</p>

  <p>Joe hurried to meet her, took hold of her arm and spoke, but she did not
  seem to hear him. She drew him along with her, up the little bench under the
  cedars straight toward Shefford. Her face held a white, mute agony, as if in
  the hour of strife it had hardened into marble. But her eyes were dark-purple
  fire&mdash;windows of an extraordinarily intense and vital life. In one night
  the girl had become a woman. But the blight Shefford had dreaded to see
  &mdash;the withering of the exquisite soul and spirit and purity he had
  considered inevitable, just as inevitable as the death of something similar
  in the flower she resembled, when it was broken and defiled&mdash;nothing of
  this was manifest in her. Straight and swiftly she came to him back in the
  shade of the cedars and took hold of his hands.</p>

  <p>"Last night&mdash;HE CAME!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Fay&mdash;I&mdash;I know," replied Shefford, haltingly.</p>

  <p>He was tremblingly conscious of amaze at her&mdash;of something wonderful
  in her. She did not heed Joe, who stepped aside a little; she did not see Nas
  Ta Bega, who sat motionless on a log, apparently oblivious to her
  presence.</p>

  <p>"You knew he came?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Fay. I was awake when&mdash;they rode in. I watched them. I sat up
  all night. I saw them ride away."</p>

  <p>"If you knew when he came why didn't you run to me&mdash;to get to me
  before he did?"</p>

  <p>Her question was unanswerable. It had the force of a blow. It stunned him.
  Its sharp, frank directness sprang from a simplicity and a strength that had
  not been nurtured in the life he had lived. So far men had wandered from
  truth and nature!</p>

  <p>"I came to you as soon as I was able," she went on. "I must have fainted.
  I just had to drag myself around... And now I can tell you."</p>

  <p>He was powerless to reply, as if she had put another unanswerable
  question. What did she mean to tell him? What might she not tell him? She
  loosed her hands from his and lifted them to his shoulders, and that was the
  first conscious action of feeling, of intimacy, which she had ever shown. It
  quite robbed Shefford of strength, and in spite of his sorrow there was an
  indefinable thrill in her touch. He looked at her, saw the white-and-gold
  beauty that was hers yesterday and seemed changed to-day, and he recognized
  Fay Larkin in a woman he did not know.</p>

  <p>"Listen! He came&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fay, don't&mdash;tell me," interrupted Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I WILL tell you," she said.</p>

  <p>Did the instinct of love teach her how to mitigate his pain? Shefford felt
  that, as he felt the new-born strength in her.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she went on. "He came when I was undressing for bed. I heard the
  horse. He knocked on the door. Something terrible happened to me then. I felt
  sick and my head wasn't clear. I remember next&mdash;his being in the room
  &mdash;the lamp was out&mdash;I couldn't see very well. He thought I was sick
  and he gave me a drink and let the air blow in on me through the window. I
  remember I lay back in the chair and I thought. And I listened. When would
  you come? I didn't feel that you could leave me there alone with him. For his
  coming was different this time. That pain like a blade in my side!... When it
  came I was not the same. I loved you. I understood then. I belonged to you. I
  couldn't let him touch me. I had never been his wife. When I realized
  this&mdash;that he was there, that you might suffer for it&mdash;I cried
  right out.</p>

  <p>"He thought I was sick. He worked over me. He gave me medicine. And then
  he prayed. I saw him, in the dark, on his knees, praying for me. That seemed
  strange. Yet he was kind, so kind that I begged him to let me go. I was not a
  Mormon. I couldn't marry him. I begged him to let me go.</p>

  <p>"Then he thought I had been deceiving him. He fell into a fury. He talked
  for a long time. He called upon God to visit my sins upon me. He tried to
  make me pray. But I wouldn't. And then I fought him. I'd have screamed for
  you had he not smothered me. I got weak... And you never came. I know I
  thought you would come. But you didn't. Then I&mdash;I gave out. And after
  &mdash;some time&mdash;I must have fainted."</p>

  <p>"Fay! For Heaven's sake, how could I come to you?" burst out Shefford,
  hoarse and white with remorse, passion, pain.</p>

  <p>"If I'm any man's wife I'm yours. It's a thing you FEEL, isn't it? I know
  that now... But I want to know what to do?"</p>

  <p>"Fay!" he cried, huskily.</p>

  <p>"I'm sick of it all. If it weren't for you I'd climb the wall and throw
  myself off. That would be easy for me. I'd love to die that way. All my life
  I've been high up on the walls. To fall would be nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mustn't talk like that!"</p>

  <p>"Do you love me?" she asked, with a low and deathless sweetness.</p>

  <p>"Love you? With all my heart! Nothing can change that!"</p>

  <p>"Do you want me&mdash;as you used to want the Fay Larkin lost in Surprise
  Valley? Do you love me that way? I understand things better than before, but
  still&mdash;not all. I AM Fay Larkin. I think I must have dreamed of you all
  my life. I was glad when you came here. I've been happy lately. I
  forgot&mdash;till last night. Maybe it needed that to make me see I've loved
  you all the time... And I fought him like a wildcat!... Tell me the truth. I
  feel I'm yours. Is that true? If I'm not&mdash;I'll not live another hour.
  Something holds me up. I am the same... Do you want me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Fay Larkin, I want you," replied Shefford, steadily, with his grip
  on her arms.</p>

  <p>"Then take me away. I don't want to live here another hour."</p>

  <p>"Fay, I'll take you. But it can't be done at once. We must plan. I need
  help. There are Lassiter and Jane to get out of Surprise Valley. Give me
  time, dear&mdash;give me time. It'll be a hard job. And we must plan so we
  can positively get away. Give me time, Fay."</p>

  <p>"Suppose HE comes back?" she queried, with a singular depth of voice.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to risk that," replied Shefford, miserably. "But&mdash;he
  won't come soon."</p>

  <p>"He said he would," she flashed.</p>

  <p>Shefford seemed to freeze inwardly with her words. Love had made her a
  woman and now the woman in her was speaking. She saw the truth as he could
  not see it. And the truth was nature. She had been hidden all her life from
  the world, from knowledge as he had it, yet when love betrayed her womanhood
  to her she acquired all its subtlety.</p>

  <p>"If I wait and he DOES come will you keep me from him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"How can I? I'm staking all on the chance of his not coming soon... But,
  Fay, if he DOES come and I don't give up our secret&mdash;how on earth can I
  keep you from him?" demanded Shefford.</p>

  <p>"If you love me you will do it," she said, as simply as if she were
  fate.</p>

  <p>"But how?" cried Shefford, almost beside himself.</p>

  <p>"You are a man. Any man would save the woman who loves him from&mdash;
  from&mdash;Oh, from a beast!... How would Lassiter do it?"</p>

  <p>"Lassiter!"</p>

  <p>"YOU CAN KILL HIM!"</p>

  <p>It was there, deep and full in her voice, the strength of the elemental
  forces that had surrounded her, primitive passion and hate and love, as they
  were in woman in the beginning.</p>

  <p>"My God!" Shefford cried aloud with his spirit when all that was red in
  him sprang again into a flame of hell. That was what had been wrong with him
  last night. He could kill this stealthy night-rider, and now, face to face
  with Fay, who had never been so beautiful and wonderful as in this hour when
  she made love the only and the sacred thing of life, now he had it in him to
  kill. Yet, murder&mdash;even to kill a brute&mdash;that was not for John
  Shefford, not the way for him to save a woman. Reason and wisdom still fought
  the passion in him. If he could but cling to them&mdash;have them with him in
  the dark and contending hour!</p>

  <p>She leaned against him now, exhausted, her soul in her eyes, and they saw
  only him. Shefford was all but powerless to resist the longing to take her
  into his arms, to hold her to his heart, to let himself go. Did not her love
  give her to him? Shefford gazed helplessly at the stricken Joe Lake, at the
  somber Indian, as if from them he expected help.</p>

  <p>"I know him now," said Fay, breaking the silence with startling
  suddenness.</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him in the light. I flashed a candle in his face. I saw it. I
  know him now. He was there at Stonebridge with us, and I never knew him. But
  I know him now. His name is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't tell me who he is!" implored Shefford.</p>

  <p>Ignorance was Shefford's safeguard against himself. To make a name of this
  heretofore intangible man, to give him an identity apart from the crowd, to
  be able to recognize him&mdash;that for Shefford would be fatal.</p>

  <p>"Fay&mdash;tell me&mdash;no more," he said, brokenly. "I love you and I
  will give you my life. Trust me. I swear I'll save you."</p>

  <p>"Will you take me away soon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She appeared satisfied with that and dropped her hands and moved back from
  him. A light flitted over her white face, and her eyes grew dark and humid,
  losing their fire in changing, shadowing thought of submission, of trust, of
  hope.</p>

  <p>"I can lead you to Surprise Valley," she said. "I feel the way. It's
  there!" And she pointed to the west.</p>

  <p>"Fay, we'll go&mdash;soon. I must plan. I'll see you to-night. Then we'll
  talk. Run home now, before some of the women see you here."</p>

  <p>She said good-by and started away under the cedars, out into the open
  where her hair shone like gold in the sunlight, and she took the stepping-
  stones with her old free grace, and strode down the path swift and lithe as
  an Indian. Once she turned to wave a hand.</p>

  <p>Shefford watched her with a torture of pride, love, hope, and fear
  contending within him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV.</a> &mdash; THE NAVAJO</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT morning a Piute rode into the valley.</p>

  <p>Shefford recognized him as the brave who had been in love with Glen Naspa.
  The moment Nas Ta Bega saw this visitor he made a singular motion with his
  hands&mdash;a motion that somehow to Shefford suggested despair&mdash;and
  then he waited, somber and statuesque, for the messenger to come to him. It
  was the Piute who did all the talking, and that was brief. Then the Navajo
  stood motionless, with his hands crossed over his breast. Shefford drew near
  and waited.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai," said the Navajo, "Nas Ta Bega said his sister would come home
  some day... Glen Naspa is in the hogan of her grandfather."</p>

  <p>He spoke in his usual slow, guttural voice, and he might have been bronze
  for all the emotion he expressed; yet Shefford instinctively felt the despair
  that had been hinted to him, and he put his hand on the Indian's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"If I am the Navajo's brother, then I am brother to Glen Naspa," he said.
  "I will go with you to the hogan of Hosteen Doetin."</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega went away into the valley for the horses. Shefford hurried to
  the village, made his excuses at the school, and then called to explain to
  Fay that trouble of some kind had come to the Indian.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward he was riding Nack-yal on the rough and winding trail up
  through the broken country of cliffs and canyon to the great league -long
  sage and cedar slope of the mountain. It was weeks since he had ridden the
  mustang. Nack-yal was fat and lazy. He loved his master, but he did not like
  the climb, and so fell far behind the lean and wiry pony that carried Nas Ta
  Bega. The sage levels were as purple as the haze of the distance, and there
  was a bitter- sweet tang on the strong, cool wind. The sun was gold behind
  the dark line of fringe on the mountain-top. A flock of sheep swept down one
  of the sage levels, looking like a narrow stream of white and black and
  brown. It was always amazing for Shefford to see how swiftly these Navajo
  sheep grazed along. Wild mustangs plunged out of the cedar clumps and stood
  upon the ridges, whistling defiance or curiosity, and their manes and tails
  waved in the wind.</p>

  <p>Shefford mounted slowly to the cedar bench in the midst of which were
  hidden the few hogans. And he halted at the edge to dismount and take a look
  at that downward-sweeping world of color, of wide space, at the wild desert
  upland which from there unrolled its magnificent panorama.</p>

  <p>Then he passed on into the cedars. How strange to hear the lambs bleating
  again! Lambing-time had come early, but still spring was there in the new
  green of grass, in the bright upland flower. He led his mustang out of the
  cedars into the cleared circle. It was full of colts and lambs, and there
  were the shepherd-dogs and a few old rams and ewes. But the circle was a
  quiet place this day. There were no Indians in sight. Shefford loosened the
  saddle-girths on Nack-yal and, leaving him to graze, went toward the hogan of
  Hosteen Doetin. A blanket was hung across the door. Shefford heard a low
  chanting. He waited beside the door till the covering was pulled in, then he
  entered.</p>

  <p>Hosteen Doetin met him, clasped his hand. The old Navajo could not speak;
  his fine face was working in grief; tears streamed from his dim old eyes and
  rolled down his wrinkled cheeks. His sorrow was no different from a white
  man's sorrow. Beyond him Shefford saw Nas Ta Bega standing with folded arms,
  somehow terrible in his somber impassiveness. At his feet crouched the old
  woman, Hosteen Doetin's wife, and beside her, prone and quiet, half covered
  with a blanket, lay Glen Naspa.</p>

  <p>She was dead. To Shefford she seemed older than when he had last seen her.
  And she was beautiful. Calm, cold, dark, with only bitter lips to give the
  lie to peace! There was a story in those lips.</p>

  <p>At her side, half hidden under the fold of blanket, lay a tiny bundle. Its
  human shape startled Shefford. Then he did not need to be told the tragedy.
  When he looked again at Glen Naspa's face he seemed to understand all that
  had made her older, to feel the pain that had lined and set her lips.</p>

  <p>She was dead, and she was the last of Nas Ta Bega's family. In the old
  grandfather's agony, in the wild chant of the stricken grandmother, in the
  brother's stern and terrible calmness Shefford felt more than the death of a
  loved one. The shadow of ruin, of doom, of death hovered over the girl and
  her family and her tribe and her race. There was no consolation to offer
  these relatives of Glen Naspa. Shefford took one more fascinated gaze at her
  dark, eloquent, prophetic face, at the tragic tiny shape by her side, and
  then with bowed head he left the hogan.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">OUTSIDE he paced to and fro, with an aching heart for Nas Ta
  Bega, with something of the white man's burden of crime toward the Indian
  weighing upon his soul.</p>

  <p>Old Hosteen Doetin came to him with shaking hands and words memorable of
  the time Glen Naspa left his hogan.</p>

  <p>"Me no savvy Jesus Christ. Me hungry. Me no eat Jesus Christ!"</p>

  <p>That seemed to be all of his trouble that he could express to Shefford. He
  could not understand the religion of the missionary, this Jesus Christ who
  had called his granddaughter away. And the great fear of an old Indian was
  not death, but hunger. Shefford remembered a custom of the Navajos, a thing
  barbarous looked at with a white man's mind. If an old Indian failed on a
  long march he was inclosed by a wall of stones, given plenty to eat and
  drink, and left there to die in the desert. Not death did he fear, but
  hunger! Old Hosteen Doetin expected to starve, now that the young and strong
  squaw of his family was gone.</p>

  <p>Shefford spoke in his halting Navajo and assured the old Indian that Nas
  Ta Bega would never let him starve.</p>

  <p>At sunset Shefford stood with Nas Ta Bega facing the west. The Indian was
  magnificent in repose. He watched the sun go down upon the day that had seen
  the burial of the last of his family. He resembled an impassive destiny, upon
  which no shocks fell. He had the light of that flaring golden sky in his
  face, the majesty of the mountain in his mien, the silence of the great gulf
  below on his lips. This educated Navajo, who had reverted to the life of his
  ancestors, found in the wildness and loneliness of his environment a strength
  no white teaching could ever have given him. Shefford sensed in him a
  measureless grief, an impenetrable gloom, a tragic acceptance of the meaning
  of Glen Naspa's ruin and death&mdash;the vanishing of his race from the
  earth. Death had written the law of such bitter truth round Glen Naspa's
  lips, and the same truth was here in the grandeur and gloom of the
  Navajo.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai," he said, with the beautiful sonorous roll in his voice, "Glen
  Naspa is in her grave and there are no paths to the place of her sleep. Glen
  Naspa is gone."</p>

  <p>"Gone! Where? Nas Ta Bega, remember I lost my own faith, and I have not
  yet learned yours."</p>

  <p>"The Navajo has one mother&mdash;the earth. Her body has gone to the earth
  and it will become dust. But her spirit is in the air. It shall whisper to me
  from the wind. I shall hear it on running waters. It will hide in the morning
  music of a mocking-bird and in the lonely night cry of the canyon hawk. Her
  blood will go to make the red of the Indian flowers and her soul will rest at
  midnight in the lily that opens only to the moon. She will wait in the shadow
  for me, and live in the great mountain that is my home, and for ever step
  behind me on the trail."</p>

  <p>"You will kill Willetts?" demanded Shefford.</p>

  <p>"The Navajo will not seek the missionary."</p>

  <p>"But if you meet him you'll kill him?"</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, would Nas Ta Bega kill after it is too late? What good could
  come? The Navajo is above revenge."</p>

  <p>"If he crosses my trail I think I couldn't help but kill him," muttered
  Shefford in a passion that wrung the threat from him.</p>

  <p>The Indian put his arm round the white man's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, long ago I made you my brother. And now you make me your brother.
  Is it not so? Glen Naspa's spirit calls for wisdom, not revenge. Willetts
  must be a bad man. But we'll let him live. Life will punish him. Who knows if
  he was all to blame? Glen Naspa was only one pretty Indian girl. There are
  many white men in the desert. She loved a white man when she was a baby. The
  thing was a curse... Listen, Bi Nai, and the Navajo will talk.</p>

  <p>"Many years ago the Spanish padres, the first white men, came into the
  land of the Indian. Their search was for gold. But they were not wicked men.
  They did not steal and kill. They taught the Indian many useful things. They
  brought him horses. But when they went away they left him unsatisfied with
  his life and his god.</p>

  <p>"Then came the pioneers. They crossed the great river and took the
  pasture-lands and the hunting-grounds of the Indian. They drove him backward,
  and the Indian grew sullen. He began to fight. The white man's government
  made treaties with the Indian, and these were broken. Then war came&mdash;
  fierce and bloody war. The Indian was driven to the waste places. The stream
  of pioneers, like a march of ants, spread on into the desert. Every valley
  where grass grew, every river, became a place for farms and towns. Cattle
  choked the water-holes where the buffalo and deer had once gone to drink. The
  forests in the hills were cut and the springs dried up. And the pioneers
  followed to the edge of the desert.</p>

  <p>"Then came the prospectors, mad, like the padres for the gleam of gold.
  The day was not long enough for them to dig in the creeks and the canyon;
  they worked in the night. And they brought weapons and rum to the Indian, to
  buy from him the secret of the places where the shining gold lay hidden.</p>

  <p>"Then came the traders. And they traded with the Indian. They gave him
  little for much, and that little changed his life. He learned a taste for the
  sweet foods of the white man. Because he could trade for a sack of flour he
  worked less in the field. And the very fiber of his bones softened.</p>

  <p>"Then came the missionaries. They were proselytizers for converts to their
  religion. The missionaries are good men. There may be a bad missionary, like
  Willetts, the same as there are bad men in other callings, or bad Indians.
  They say Shadd is a half-breed. But the Piutes can tell you he is a
  full-blood, and he, like me, was sent to a white man's school. In the
  beginning the missionaries did well for the Indian. They taught him cleaner
  ways of living, better farming, useful work with tools&mdash;many good
  things. But the wrong to the Indian was the undermining of his faith. It was
  not humanity that sent the missionary to the Indian. Humanity would have
  helped the Indian in his ignorance of sickness and work, and left him his
  god. For to trouble the Indian about his god worked at the roots of his
  nature.</p>

  <p>"The beauty of the Indian's life is in his love of the open, of all that
  is nature, of silence, freedom, wildness. It is a beauty of mind and soul.
  The Indian would have been content to watch and feel. To a white man he might
  be dirty and lazy&mdash;content to dream life away without trouble or what
  the white man calls evolution. The Indian might seem cruel because he leaves
  his old father out in the desert to die. But the old man wants to die that
  way, alone with his spirits and the sunset. And the white man's medicine
  keeps his old father alive days and days after he ought to be dead. Which is
  more cruel? The Navajos used to fight with other tribes, and then they were
  stronger men than they are to-day.</p>

  <p>"But leaving religion, greed, and war out of the question, contact with
  the white man would alone have ruined the Indian. The Indian and the white
  man cannot mix. The Indian brave learns the habits of the white man, acquires
  his diseases, and has not the mind or body to withstand them. The Indian girl
  learns to love the white man&mdash;and that is death of her Indian soul, if
  not of life.</p>

  <p>"So the red man is passing. Tribes once powerful have died in the life of
  Nas Ta Bega. The curse of the white man is already heavy upon my race in the
  south. Here in the north, in the wildest corner of the desert, chased here by
  the great soldier, Carson, the Navajo has made his last stand.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, you have seen the shadow in the hogan of Hosteen Doetin. Glen
  Naspa has gone to her grave, and no sisters, no children, will make paths to
  the place of her sleep. Nas Ta Bega will never have a wife&mdash;a child. He
  sees the end. It is the sunset of the Navajo... Bi Nai, the Navajo is
  dying&mdash;dying&mdash;dying!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV.</a> &mdash; WILD JUSTICE</h2>

  <p class="first">A CRESCENT moon hung above the lofty peak over the valley
  and a train of white stars ran along the bold rim of the western wall. A few
  young frogs peeped plaintively. The night was cool, yet had a touch of balmy
  spring, and a sweeter fragrance, as if the cedars and pinyons had freshened
  in the warm sun of that day.</p>

  <p>Shefford and Fay were walking in the aisles of moonlight and the patches
  of shade, and Nas Ta Bega, more than ever a shadow of his white brother,
  followed them silently.</p>

  <p>"Fay, it's growing late. Feel the dew?" said Shefford. "Come, I must take
  you back."</p>

  <p>"But the time's so short. I have said nothing that I wanted to say," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Say it quickly, then, as we go."</p>

  <p>"After all, it's only&mdash;will you take me away soon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, very soon. The Indian and I have talked. But we've made no plan yet.
  There are only three ways to get out of this country. By Stonebridge, by
  Kayenta and Durango, and by Red Lake. We must choose one. All are dangerous.
  We must lose time finding Surprise Valley. I hoped the Indian could find it.
  Then we'd bring Lassiter and Jane here and hide them near till dark, then
  take you and go. That would give us a night's start. But you must help us to
  Surprise Valley."</p>

  <p>"I can go right to it, blindfolded, or in the dark... Oh, John, hurry! I
  dread the wait. He might come again."</p>

  <p>"Joe says&mdash;they won't come very soon."</p>

  <p>"Is it far&mdash;where we're going&mdash;out of the country?"</p>

  <p>"Ten days' hard riding."</p>

  <p>"Oh! That night ride to and from Stonebridge nearly killed me. But I could
  walk very far, and climb for ever."</p>

  <p>"Fay, we'll get out of the country if I have to carry you."</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the cabin Fay turned on the porch step and, with her
  face nearer a level with his, white and sweet in the moonlight, with her eyes
  shining and unfathomable, she was more than beautiful.</p>

  <p>"You've never been inside my house," she said. "Come in. I've something
  for you."</p>

  <p>"But it's late," he remonstrated. "I suppose you've got me a cake or pie
  &mdash;something to eat. You women all think Joe and I have to be fed."</p>

  <p>"No. You'd never guess. Come in," she said, and the rare smile on her face
  was something Shefford would have gone far to see.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, for a minute."</p>

  <p>He crossed the porch, the threshold, and entered her home. Her dim, white
  shape moved in the darkness. And he followed into a room where the moon shone
  through the open window, giving soft, mellow, shadowy light. He discerned
  objects, but not clearly, for his senses seemed absorbed in the strange
  warmth and intimacy of being for the first time with her in her home.</p>

  <p>"No, it's not good to eat," she said, and her laugh was happy. "Here
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she abruptly ceased speaking. Shefford saw her plainly, and the
  slender form had stiffened, alert and strained. She was listening.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear anything," he whispered back.</p>

  <p>He stepped softly nearer the open window and listened.</p>

  <p>Clip-clop! clip-clop! clip-clop! Hard hoofs on the hard path outside!</p>

  <p>A strong and rippling thrill went over Shefford. In the soft light her
  eyes seemed unnaturally large and black and fearful.</p>

  <p>Clip-clop! clip-clop!</p>

  <p>The horse stopped outside. Then followed a metallic clink of spur against
  stirrup&mdash;thud of boots on hard ground&mdash;heavy footsteps upon the
  porch.</p>

  <p>A swift, cold contraction of throat, of breast, convulsed Shefford. His
  only thought was that he could not think.</p>

  <p>"Ho&mdash;Mary!"</p>

  <p>A voice liberated both Shefford's muscle and mind&mdash;a voice of
  strange, vibrant power. Authority of religion and cruelty of will&mdash;
  these Mormon attributes constituted that power. And Shefford suffered a
  transformation which must have been ordered by demons. That sudden flame
  seemed to curl and twine and shoot along his veins with blasting force. A
  rancorous and terrible cry leaped to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Ho&mdash;Mary!" Then came a heavy tread across the threshold of the outer
  room.</p>

  <p>Shefford dared not look at Fay. Yet, dimly, from the corner of his eye, he
  saw her, a pale shadow, turned to stone, with her arms out. If he looked, if
  he made sure of that, he was lost. When had he drawn his gun? It was there, a
  dark and glinting thing in his hand. He must fly&mdash;not through cowardice
  and fear, but because in one more moment he would kill a man. Swift as the
  thought he dove through the open window. And, leaping up, he ran under the
  dark pinyons toward camp.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake had been out late himself. He sat by the fire, smoking his pipe.
  He must have seen or heard Shefford coming, for he rose with unwonted
  alacrity, and he kicked the smoldering logs into a flickering blaze.</p>

  <p>Shefford, realizing his deliverance, came panting, staggering into the
  light. The Mormon uttered an exclamation. Then he spoke, anxiously, but what
  he said was not clear in Shefford's thick and throbbing ears. He dropped his
  pipe, a sign of perturbation, and he stared.</p>

  <p>But Shefford, without a word, lunged swiftly away into the shadow of the
  cedars. He found relief in action. He began a steep ascent of the east wall,
  a dangerous slant he had never dared even in daylight, and he climbed it
  without a slip. Danger, steep walls, perilous heights, night, and black
  canyon the same&mdash;these he never thought of. But something drove him to
  desperate effort, that the hours might seem short.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE red sun was tipping the eastern wall when he returned to
  camp, and he was neither calm nor sure of himself nor ready for sleep or
  food. Only he had put the night behind him.</p>

  <p>The Indian showed no surprise. But Joe Lake's jaw dropped and his eyes
  rolled. Moreover, Joe bore a singular aspect, the exact nature of which did
  not at once dawn upon Shefford.</p>

  <p>"By God! you've got nerve&mdash;or you're crazy!" he ejaculated,
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Then it was Shefford's turn to stare. The Mormon was haggard, grieved,
  frightened, and utterly amazed. He appeared to be trying to make certain of
  Shefford's being there in the flesh and then to find reason for it.</p>

  <p>"I've no nerve and I am crazy," replied Shefford. "But, Joe&mdash;what do
  you mean? Why do you look at me like that?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon if I get your horse that'll square us. Did you come back for
  him? You'd better hit the trail quick."</p>

  <p>"It's you now who're crazy," burst out Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Wish to God I was," replied Joe.</p>

  <p>It was then Shefford realized catastrophe, and cold fear gnawed at his
  vitals, so that he was sick.</p>

  <p>"Joe, what has happened?" he asked, with the blood thick in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better tell me?" demanded the Mormon, and a red wave blotted
  out the haggard shade of his face.</p>

  <p>"You talk like a fool," said Shefford, sharply, and he strode right up to
  Joe.</p>

  <p>"See here, Shefford, we've been pards. You're making it hard for me.
  Reckon you ain't square."</p>

  <p>Shefford shot out a long arm and his hand clutched the Mormon's burly
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Why am I not square? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Joe swallowed hard and gave himself a shake. Then he eyed his comrade
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you'd kill him. I reckon I can't blame you. I'll help you
  get away. And I'm a Mormon! Do you take the hunch?... But don't deny you
  killed him!"</p>

  <p>"Killed whom?" gasped Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Her husband!"</p>

  <p>Shefford seemed stricken by a slow, paralyzing horror. The Mormon's
  changing face grew huge and indistinct and awful in his sight. He was
  clutched and shaken in Joe's rude hands, yet scarcely felt them. Joe seemed
  to be bellowing at him, but the voice was far off. Then Shefford began to
  see, to hear through some cold and terrible deadness that had come between
  him and everything.</p>

  <p>"Say YOU killed him!" hoarsely supplicated the Mormon.</p>

  <p>Shefford had not yet control of speech. Something in his gaze appeared to
  drive Joe frantic.</p>

  <p>"Damn you! Tell me quick. Say YOU killed him!... If you want to know my
  stand, why, I'm glad!... Shefford, don't look so stony!... For HER sake, say
  you killed him!"</p>

  <p>Shefford stood with a face as gray and still as stone. With a groan the
  Mormon drew away from him and sank upon a log. He bowed his head; his broad
  shoulders heaved; husky sounds came from him. Then with a violent wrench he
  plunged to his feet and shook himself like a huge, savage dog.</p>

  <p>"Reckon it's no time to weaken," he said, huskily, and with the words a
  dark, hard, somber bitterness came to his face.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;is&mdash;she?" whispered Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Shut up in the school-house," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Did she&mdash;did she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She neither denied nor confessed."</p>

  <p>"Have you&mdash;seen her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How did&mdash;she look?"</p>

  <p>"Cool and quiet as the Indian there... Game as hell! She always had stuff
  in her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Joe!... It's unbelievable!" cried Shefford. "That lovely, innocent
  girl! She couldn't&mdash;she couldn't."</p>

  <p>"She's fixed him. Don't think of that. It's too late. We ought to have
  saved her."</p>

  <p>"God!... She begged me to hurry&mdash;to take her away."</p>

  <p>"Think what we can do NOW to save her," cut in the Mormon.</p>

  <p>Shefford sustained a vivifying shock. "To save her?" he echoed.</p>

  <p>"Think, man!"</p>

  <p>"Joe, I can hit the trail and let you tell them I killed him," burst out
  Shefford in panting excitement.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I can."</p>

  <p>"So help me God I'll do it!"</p>

  <p>The Mormon turned a dark and austere glance upon Shefford.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't leave her. She killed him for your sake... You must fight for
  her now&mdash;save her&mdash;take her away."</p>

  <p>"But the law!"</p>

  <p>"Law!" scoffed Joe. "In these wilds men get killed and there's no law. But
  if she's taken back to Stonebridge those iron-jawed old Mormons will make law
  enough to&mdash;to... Shefford, the thing is&mdash;get her away. Once out of
  the country, she's safe. Mormons keep their secrets."</p>

  <p>"I'll take her. Joe, will you help me?"</p>

  <p>Shefford, even in his agitation, felt the Mormon's silence to be a consent
  that need not have been asked. And Shefford had a passionate gratefulness
  toward his comrade. That stultifying and blinding prejudice which had always
  seemed to remove a Mormon outside the pale of certain virtue suffered final
  eclipse; and Joe Lake stood out a man, strange and crude, but with a heart
  and a soul.</p>

  <p>"Joe, tell me what to do," said Shefford, with a simplicity that meant he
  needed only to be directed.</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together. Get your nerve back," replied Joe. "Reckon you'd
  better show yourself over there. No one saw you come in this morning&mdash;
  your absence from camp isn't known. It's better you seem curious and shocked
  like the rest of us. Come on. We'll go over. And afterward we'll get the
  Indian, and plan."</p>

  <p>They left camp and, crossing the brook, took the shaded path toward the
  village. Hope of saving Fay, the need of all his strength and nerve and
  cunning to effect that end, gave Shefford the supreme courage to overcome his
  horror and fear. On that short walk under the pinyons to Fay's cabin he had
  suffered many changes of emotion, but never anything like this change which
  made him fierce and strong to fight, deep and crafty to plan, hard as iron to
  endure.</p>

  <p>The village appeared very quiet, though groups of women stood at the doors
  of cabins. If they talked, it was very low. Henninger and Smith, two of the
  three Mormon men living in the village, were standing before the closed door
  of the school-house. A tigerish feeling thrilled Shefford when he saw them on
  guard there. Shefford purposely avoided looking at Fay's cabin as long as he
  could keep from it. When he had to look he saw several hooded, whispering
  women in the yard, and Beal, the other Mormon man, standing in the cabin
  door. Upon the porch lay the long shape of a man, covered with blankets.</p>

  <p>Shefford experienced a horrible curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Say, Beal, I've fetched Shefford over," said Lake. "He's pretty much cut
  up."</p>

  <p>Beal wagged a solemn head, but said nothing. His mind seemed absent or
  steeped in gloom, and he looked up as one silently praying.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake strode upon the little porch and, reaching down, he stripped the
  blanket from the shrouded form.</p>

  <p>Shefford saw a sharp, cold, ghastly face. "WAGGONER!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Lake.</p>

  <p>Waggoner! Shefford remembered the strange power in his face, and, now that
  life had gone, that power was stripped of all disguise. Death, in Shefford's
  years of ministry, had lain under his gaze many times and in a multiplicity
  of aspects, but never before had he seen it stamped so strangely. Shefford
  did not need to be told that here was a man who believed he had conversed
  with God on earth, who believed he had a divine right to rule women, who had
  a will that would not yield itself to death utterly. Waggoner, then, was the
  devil who had come masked to Surprise Valley, had forced a martyrdom upon Fay
  Larkin. And this was the Mormon who had made Fay Larkin a murderess. Shefford
  had hated him living, and now he hated him dead. Death here was robbed of all
  nobility, of pathos, of majesty. It was only retribution. Wild justice! But
  alas! that it had to be meted out by a white-soled girl whose innocence was
  as great as the unconscious savagery which she had assimilated from her
  lonely and wild environment. Shefford laid a despairing curse upon his own
  head, and a terrible remorse knocked at his heart. He had left her alone,
  this girl in whom love had made the great change&mdash;like a coward he had
  left her alone. That curse he visited upon himself because he had been the
  spirit and the motive of this wild justice, and his should have been the
  deed.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake touched Shefford's arm and pointed at the haft of a knife
  protruding from Waggoner's breast. It was a wooden haft. Shefford had seen it
  before somewhere.</p>

  <p>Then he was struck with what perhaps Joe meant him to see&mdash;the
  singular impression the haft gave of one sweeping, accurate, powerful stroke.
  A strong arm had driven that blade home. The haft was sunk deep; there was a
  little depression in the cloth; no blood showed; and the weapon looked as if
  it could not be pulled out. Shefford's thought went fatally and irresistibly
  to Fay Larkin's strong arm. He saw her flash that white arm and lift the
  heavy bucket from the spring with an ease he wondered at. He felt the strong
  clasp of her hand as she had given it to him in a flying leap across a
  crevice upon the walls. Yes, her fine hand and the round, strong arm
  possessed the strength to have given that blade its singular directness and
  force. The marvel was not in the physical action. It hid inscrutably in the
  mystery of deadly passion rising out of a gentle and sad heart.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake drew up the blanket and shut from Shefford's fascinated gaze that
  spare form, that accusing knife, that face of strange, cruel power.</p>

  <p>"Anybody been sent for?" asked Lake of Beal.</p>

  <p>"Yes. An Indian boy went for the Piute. We'll send him to Stonebridge,"
  replied the Mormon.</p>

  <p>"How soon do you expect any one here from Stonebridge?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, mebbe by noon."</p>

  <p>"Meantime what's to be done with&mdash;this?"</p>

  <p>"Elder Smith thinks the body should stay right here where it fell till
  they come from Stonebridge."</p>

  <p>"Waggoner was found here, then?"</p>

  <p>"Right here."</p>

  <p>"Who found him?"</p>

  <p>"Mother Smith. She came over early. An' the sight made her scream. The
  women all came runnin'. Mother Smith had to be put to bed."</p>

  <p>"Who found&mdash;Mary?"</p>

  <p>"See here, Joe, I told you all I knowed once before," replied the Mormon,
  testily.</p>

  <p>"I've forgotten. Was sort of bewildered. Tell me again... Who found
  &mdash;her?"</p>

  <p>"The women folks. She laid right inside the door, in a dead faint. She
  hadn't undressed. There was blood on her hands an' a cut or scratch. The
  women fetched her to. But she wouldn't talk. Then Elder Smith come an' took
  her. They've got her locked up."</p>

  <p>Then Joe led Shefford away from the cabin farther on into the village.
  When they were halted by the somber, grieving women it was Joe who did the
  talking. They passed the school-house, and here Shefford quickened his step.
  He could scarcely bear the feeling that rushed over him. And the Mormon
  gripped his arm as if he understood.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, which one of these younger women do you reckon your best
  friend? Ruth?" asked Lake, earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Ruth, by all means. Just lately I haven't seen her often. But we've been
  close friends. I think she'd do much for me."</p>

  <p>"Maybe there'll be a chance to find out. Maybe we'll need Ruth. Let's have
  a word with her. I haven't seen her out among the women."</p>

  <p>They stopped at the door of Ruth's cabin. It was closed. When Joe knocked
  there came a sound of footsteps inside, a hand drew aside the window-blind,
  and presently the door opened. Ruth stood there, dressed in somber hue. She
  was a pretty, slender, blue-eyed, brown-haired young woman.</p>

  <p>Shefford imagined from her pallor and the set look of shock upon her face,
  that the tragedy had affected her more powerfully than it had the other
  women. When he remembered that she had been more friendly with Fay Larkin
  than any other neighbor, he made sure he was right in his conjecture.</p>

  <p>"Come in," was Ruth's greeting.</p>

  <p>"No. We just wanted to say a word. I noticed you've not been out. Do you
  know&mdash;all about it?"</p>

  <p>She gave them a strange glance.</p>

  <p>"Any of the women folks been in?" added Joe.</p>

  <p>"Hester ran over. She told me through the window. Then I barred my door to
  keep the other women out."</p>

  <p>"What for?" asked Joe, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Please come in," she said, in reply.</p>

  <p>They entered, and she closed the door after them. The change that came
  over her then was the loosing of restraint.</p>

  <p>"Joe&mdash;what will they do with Mary?" she queried, tensely.</p>

  <p>The Mormon studied her with dark, speculative eyes. "Hang her!" he
  rejoined in brutal harshness.</p>

  <p>"O Mother of Saints!" she cried, and her hands went up.</p>

  <p>"You're sorry for Mary, then?" asked Joe, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"My heart is breaking for her."</p>

  <p>"Well, so's Shefford's," said the Mormon, huskily. "And mine's kind of
  damn shaky."</p>

  <p>Ruth glided to Shefford with a woman's swift softness.</p>

  <p>"You've been my good&mdash;my best friend. You were hers, too. Oh, I
  know!... Can't you do something for her?"</p>

  <p>"I hope to God I can," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>Then the three stood looking from one to the other, in a strong and subtly
  realizing moment drawn together.</p>

  <p>"Ruth," whispered Joe, hoarsely, and then he glanced fearfully around, at
  the window and door, as if listeners were there. It was certain that his dark
  face had paled. He tried to whisper more, only to fail. Shefford divined the
  weight of Mormonism that burdened Joe Lake then. Joe was faithful to a love
  for Fay Larkin, noble in friendship to Shefford, desperate in a bitter strait
  with his own manliness, but the power of that creed by which he had been
  raised struck his lips mute. For to speak on meant to be false to that creed.
  Already in his heart he had decided, yet he could not voice the thing.</p>

  <p>"Ruth"&mdash;Shefford took up the Mormon's unfinished whisper&mdash; "if
  we plan to save her&mdash;if we need you&mdash;will you help?"</p>

  <p>Ruth turned white, but an instant and splendid fire shone in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Try me," she whispered back. "I'll change places with her&mdash;so you
  can get her away. They can't do much to me."</p>

  <p>Shefford wrung her hands. Joe licked his lips and found his voice: "We'll
  come back later." Then he led the way out and Shefford followed. They were
  silent all the way back to camp.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega sat in repose where they had left him, a thoughtful, somber
  figure. Shefford went directly to the Indian, and Joe tarried at the
  camp-fire, where he raked out some red embers and put one upon the bowl of
  his pipe. He puffed clouds of white smoke, then found a seat beside the
  others.</p>

  <p>"Shefford, go ahead. Talk. It'll take a deal of talk. I'll listen. Then
  I'll talk. It'll be Nas Ta Bega who makes the plan out of it all."</p>

  <p>Shefford launched himself so swiftly that he scarcely talked coherently.
  But he made clear the points that he must save Fay, get her away from the
  village, let her lead him to Surprise Valley, rescue Lassiter and Jane
  Withersteen, and take them all out of the country.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake dubiously shook his head. Manifestly the Surprise Valley part of
  the situation presented a new and serious obstacle. It changed the whole
  thing. To try to take the three out by way of Kayenta and Durango was not to
  be thought of, for reasons he briefly stated. The Red Lake trail was the only
  one left, and if that were taken the chances were against Shefford. It was
  five days over sand to Red Lake&mdash;impossible to hide a trail&mdash; and
  even with a day's start Shefford could not escape the hard-riding men who
  would come from Stonebridge. Besides, after reaching Red Lake, there were
  days and days of desert-travel needful to avoid places like Blue Canyon,
  Tuba, Moencopie, and the Indian villages.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to risk all that," declared Shefford, desperately.</p>

  <p>"It's a fool risk," retorted Joe. "Listen. By tomorrow noon all of
  Stonebridge, more or less, will be riding in here. You've got to get away to-
  night with the girl&mdash;or never! And to-morrow you've got to find that
  Lassiter and the woman in Surprise Valley. This valley must be back, deep in
  the canyon country. Well, you've got to come out this way again. No trail
  through here would be safe. Why, you'd put all your heads in a rope!... You
  mustn't come through this way. It'll have to be tried across country, off the
  trails, and that means hell&mdash;day-and-night travel, no camp, no feed for
  horses&mdash;maybe no water. Then you'll have the best trackers in Utah like
  hounds on your trail."</p>

  <p>When the Mormon ceased his forceful speech there was a silence fraught
  with hopeless meaning. He bowed his head in gloom. Shefford, growing sick
  again to his marrow, fought a cold, hateful sense of despair.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai!" In his extremity he called to the Indian.</p>

  <p>"The Navajo has heard," replied Nas Ta Bega, strangely speaking in his own
  language.</p>

  <p>With a long, slow heave of breast Shefford felt his despair leave him. In
  the Indian lay his salvation. He knew it. Joe Lake caught the subtle spirit
  of the moment and looked up eagerly.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega stretched an arm toward the east, and spoke in Navajo. But
  Shefford, owing to the hurry and excitement of his mind, could not translate.
  Joe Lake listened, gave a violent start, leaped up with all his big frame
  quivering, and then fired question after question at the Indian. When the
  Navajo had replied to all, Joe drew himself up as if facing an irrevocable
  decision which would wring his very soul. What did he cast off in that
  moment? What did he grapple with? Shefford had no means to tell, except by
  the instinct which baffled him. But whether the Mormon's trial was one of
  spiritual rending or the natural physical fear of a perilous, virtually
  impossible venture, the fact was he was magnificent in his acceptance of it.
  He turned to Shefford, white, cold, yet glowing.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega believes he can take you down a canyon to the big river
  &mdash;the Colorado. He knows the head of this canyon. Nonnezoshe Boco it's
  called&mdash;canyon of the rainbow bridge. He has never been down it. Only
  two or three living Indians have ever seen the great stone bridge. But all
  have heard of it. They worship it as a god. There's water runs down this
  canyon and water runs to the river. Nas Ta Bega thinks he can take you down
  to the river."</p>

  <p>"Go on," cried Shefford breathlessly, as Joe paused.</p>

  <p>"The Indian plans this way. God, it's great!... If only I can do my end!
  ... He plans to take mustangs to-day and wait with them for you to-night or
  to- morrow till you come with the girl. You'll go get Lassiter and the woman
  out of Surprise Valley. Then you'll strike east for Nonnezoshe Boco. If
  possible, you must take a pack of grub. You may be days going down&mdash; and
  waiting for me at the mouth of the canyon, at the river."</p>

  <p>"Joe! Where will you be?"</p>

  <p>"I'll ride like hell for Kayenta, get another horse there, and ride like
  hell for the San Juan River. There's a big flatboat at the Durango crossing.
  I'll go down the San Juan in that&mdash;into the big river. I'll drift down
  by day, tie up by night, and watch for you at the mouth of every canyon till
  I come to Nonnezoshe Boco."</p>

  <p>Shefford could not believe the evidence of his ears. He knew the
  treacherous San Juan River. He had heard of the great, sweeping, terrible red
  Colorado and its roaring rapids.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it seems impossible!" he gasped. "You'll just lose your life for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"The Indian will turn the trick, I tell you. Take my hunch. It's nothing
  for me to drift down a swift river. I worked a ferry-boat once."</p>

  <p>Shefford, to whom flying straws would have seemed stable, caught the
  inflection of defiance and daring and hope of the Mormon's spirit.</p>

  <p>"What then&mdash;after you meet us at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco?" he
  queried.</p>

  <p>"We'll all drift down to Lee's Ferry. That's at the head of Marble Canyon.
  We'll get out on the south side of the river, thus avoiding any Mormons at
  the ferry. Nas Ta Bega knows the country. It's open desert&mdash;on the other
  side of these plateaus. He can get horses from Navajos. Then you'll strike
  south for Willow Springs."</p>

  <p>"Willow Springs? That's Presbrey's trading-post," said Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Never met him. But he'll see you safe out of the Painted Desert... The
  thing that worries me most is how not to miss you all at the mouth of
  Nonnezoshe. You must have sharp eyes. But I forget the Indian. A bird
  couldn't pass him... And suppose Nonnezoshe Boco has a steep-walled, narrow
  mouth opening into a rapids!... Whew! Well, the Indian will figure that, too.
  Now, let's put our heads together and plan how to turn this end of the trick
  here. Getting the girl!"</p>

  <p>After a short colloquy it was arranged that Shefford would go to Ruth and
  talk to her of the aid she had promised. Joe averred that this aid could be
  best given by Ruth going in her somber gown and hood to the school-house, and
  there, while Joe and Shefford engaged the guards outside, she would change
  apparel and places with Fay and let her come forth.</p>

  <p>"What'll they do to Ruth?" demanded Shefford. "We can't accept her
  sacrifice if she's to suffer&mdash;or be punished."</p>

  <p>"Reckon Ruth has a strong hunch that she can get away with it. Did you
  notice how strange she said that? Well, they can't do much to her. The bishop
  may damn her soul. But&mdash;Ruth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Lake hesitated and broke off. Not improbably he had meant to say that
  of all the Mormon women in the valley Ruth was the least likely to suffer
  from punishment inflicted upon her soul.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, it's our only chance," went on Joe, "unless we kill a couple of
  men. Ruth will gladly take what comes to help you."</p>

  <p>"All right; I consent," replied Shefford, with emotion. "And now after she
  comes out&mdash;the supposed Ruth&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"You can be natural-like. Go with her back to Ruth's cabin. Then stroll
  off into the cedars. Then climb the west wall. Meanwhile Nas Ta Bega will
  ride off with a pack of grub and Nack-yal and several other mustangs. He'll
  wait for you or you'll wait for him, as the case may be, at some appointed
  place. When you're gone I'll jump my horse and hit the trail for Kayenta and
  the San Juan."</p>

  <p>"Very well; that's settled," said Shefford, soberly. "I'll go at once to
  see Ruth. You and Nas Ta Bega decide on where I'm to meet him."</p>

  <p>"Reckon you'd do just as well to walk round and come up to Ruth's from the
  other side&mdash;instead of going through the village," suggested Joe.</p>

  <p>Shefford approached Ruth's cabin in a roundabout way; nevertheless, she
  saw him coming before he got there and, opening the door, stood pale,
  composed, and quietly bade him enter. Briefly, in low and earnest voice,
  Shefford acquainted her with the plan.</p>

  <p>"You love her so much," she said, wistfully, wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do. Is it too much to ask of you to do this thing?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Do it?" she queried, with a flash of spirit. "Of course I'll do it."</p>

  <p>"Ruth, I can't thank you. I can't. I've only a faint idea what you're
  risking. That distresses me. I'm afraid of what may happen to you."</p>

  <p>She gave him another of the strange glances. "I don't risk so much as you
  think," she said, significantly.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She came close to him, and her hands clasped his arms and she looked up at
  him, her eyes darkening and her face growing paler. "Will you swear to keep
  my secret?" she asked, very low.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I swear."</p>

  <p>"I was one of Waggoner's sealed wives!"</p>

  <p>"God Almighty!" broke out Shefford, utterly overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's why I say I don't risk so much. I will make up a story to
  tell the bishop and everybody. I'll tell that Waggoner was jealous, that he
  was brutal to Mary, that I believed she was goaded to her mad deed, that I
  thought she ought to be free. They'll be terrible. But what can they do to
  me? My husband is dead... and if I have to go to hell to keep from marrying
  another married Mormon, I'll go!"</p>

  <p>In that low, passionate utterance Shefford read the death-blow to the old
  Mormon polygamous creed. In the uplift of his spirit, in the joy at this
  revelation, he almost forgot the stern matter at hand. Ruth and Joe Lake
  belonged to a younger generation of Mormons. Their nobility in this instance
  was in part a revolt at the conditions of their lives. Doubt was knocking at
  Joe Lake's heart, and conviction had come to this young sealed wife, bitter
  and hopeless while she had been fettered, strong and mounting now that she
  was free. In a flash of inspiration Shefford saw the old order changing. The
  Mormon creed might survive, but that part of it which was an affront to
  nature, a horrible yoke on women's necks, was doomed. It could not live. It
  could never have survived more than a generation or two of religious
  fanatics. Shefford had marked a different force and religious fervor in the
  younger Mormons, and now he understood them.</p>

  <p>"Ruth, you talk wildly," he said. "But I understand. I see. You are free
  and you're going to stay free... It stuns me to think of that man of many
  wives. What did you feel when you were told he was dead?"</p>

  <p>"I dare not think of that. It makes me&mdash;wicked. And he was good to
  me... Listen. Last night about midnight he came to my window and woke me. I
  got up and let him in. He was in a terrible state. I thought he was crazy. He
  walked the floor and called on his saints and prayed. When I wanted to light
  a lamp he wouldn't let me. He was afraid I'd see his face. But I saw well
  enough in the moonlight. And I knew something had happened. So I soothed and
  coaxed him. He had been a man as close-mouthed as a stone. Yet then I got him
  to talk... He had gone to Mary's, and upon entering, thought he heard some
  one with her. She didn't answer him at first. When he found her in her
  bedroom she was like a ghost. He accused her. Her silence made him furious.
  Then he berated her, brought down the wrath of God upon her, threatened her
  with damnation. All of which she never seemed to hear. But when he tried to
  touch her she flew at him like a she-panther. That's what he called her. She
  said she'd kill him! And she drove him out of her house... He was all weak
  and unstrung, and I believe scared, too, when he came to me. She must have
  been a fury. Those quiet, gentle women are furies when they're once roused.
  Well, I was hours up with him and finally he got over it. He didn't pray any
  more. He paced the room. It was just daybreak when he said the wrath of God
  had come to him. I tried to keep him from going back to Mary. But he went...
  An hour later the women ran to tell me he had been found dead at Mary's
  door."</p>

  <p>"Ruth&mdash;she was mad&mdash;driven&mdash;she didn't know what she
  &mdash;was doing," said Shefford, brokenly.</p>

  <p>"She was always a strange girl, more like an Indian than any one I ever
  knew. We called her the Sago Lily. I gave her the name. She was so sweet,
  lovely, white and gold, like those flowers... And to think! Oh, it's horrible
  for her! You must save her. If you get her away there never will be anything
  come of it. The Mormons will hush it up."</p>

  <p>"Ruth, time is flying," rejoined Shefford, hurriedly. "I must go back to
  Joe. You be ready for us when we come. Wear something loose, easily thrown
  off, and don't forget the long hood."</p>

  <p>"I'll be ready and watching," she said. "The sooner the better, I'd
  say."</p>

  <p>He left her and returned toward camp in the same circling route by which
  he had come. The Indian had disappeared and so had his mustang. This
  significant fact augmented Shefford's hurried, thrilling excitement. But one
  glance at Joe's face changed all that to a sudden numbness, a sinking of his
  heart.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Look there!" exclaimed the Mormon.</p>

  <p>Shefford's quick eye caught sight of horses and men down the valley. He
  saw several Indians and three or four white men. They were making camp.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" demanded Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Shadd and some of his gang. Reckon that Piute told the news. By to-
  morrow the valley will be full as a horse-wrangler's corral... Lucky Nas Ta
  Bega got away before that gang rode in. Now things won't look as queer as
  they might have looked. The Indian took a pack of grub, six mustangs, and my
  guns. Then there was your rifle in your saddle-sheath. So you'll be well
  heeled in case you come to close quarters. Reckon you can look for a running
  fight. For now, as soon as your flight is discovered, Shadd will hit your
  trail. He's in with the Mormons. You know him&mdash;what you'll have to deal
  with. But the advantage will all be yours. You can ambush the trail."</p>

  <p>"We're in for it. And the sooner we're off the better," replied Shefford,
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"Reckon that's gospel. Well&mdash;come on!"</p>

  <p>The Mormon strode off, and Shefford, catching up with him, kept at his
  side. Shefford's mind was full, but Joe's dark and gloomy face did not invite
  communication. They entered the pinyon grove and passed the cabin where the
  tragedy had been enacted. A tarpaulin had been stretched across the front
  porch. Beal was not in sight, nor were any of the women.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," said Shefford, suddenly. "Where am I to meet the Indian?"</p>

  <p>"Climb the west wall, back of camp," replied Joe. "Nas Ta Bega took the
  Stonebridge trail. But he'll leave that, climb the rocks, then hide the
  outfit and come back to watch for you. Reckon he'll see you when you top the
  wall."</p>

  <p>They passed on into the heart of the village. Joe tarried at the window of
  a cabin, and passed a few remarks to a woman there, and then he inquired for
  Mother Smith at her house. When they left here the Mormon gave Shefford a
  nudge. Then they separated, Joe going toward the school-house, while Shefford
  bent his steps in the direction of Ruth's home.</p>

  <p>Her door opened before he had a chance to knock. He entered. Ruth, white
  and resolute, greeted him with a wistful smile.</p>

  <p>"All ready?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Are you?" he replied, low-voiced.</p>

  <p>"I've only to put on my hood. I think luck favors you. Hester was here and
  she said Elder Smith told some one that Mary hadn't been offered anything to
  eat yet. So I'm taking her a little. It'll be a good excuse for me to get in
  the school-house to see her. I can throw off this dress and she can put it on
  in a minute. Then the hood. I mustn't forget to hide her golden hair. You
  know how it flies. But this is a big hood... Well, I'm ready now. And
  &mdash;this 's our last time together."</p>

  <p>"Ruth, what can I say&mdash;how can I thank you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want any thanks. It'll be something to think of always&mdash;to
  make me happy... Only I'd like to feel you&mdash;you cared a little."</p>

  <p>The wistful smile was there, a tremor on the sad lips, and a shadow of
  soul-hunger in her eyes. Shefford did not misunderstand her. She did not mean
  love, although it was a yearning for real love that she mutely expressed.</p>

  <p>"Care! I shall care all my life," he said, with strong feeling. "I shall
  never forget you."</p>

  <p>"It's not likely I'll forget you... Good-by, John!"</p>

  <p>Shefford took her in his arms and held her close. "Ruth&mdash;good-by!" he
  said, huskily.</p>

  <p>Then he released her. She adjusted the hood and, taking up a little tray
  which held food covered with a napkin, she turned to the door. He opened it
  and they went out.</p>

  <p>They did not speak another word.</p>

  <p>It was not a long walk from Ruth's home to the school-house, yet if it
  were to be measured by Shefford's emotion the distance would have been
  unending. The sacrifice offered by Ruth and Joe would have been noble under
  any circumstances had they been Gentiles or persons with no particular
  religion, but, considering that they were Mormons, that Ruth had been a
  sealed-wife, that Joe had been brought up under the strange, secret, and
  binding creed, their action was no less than tremendous in its import.
  Shefford took it to mean vastly more than loyalty to him and pity for Fay
  Larkin. As Ruth and Joe had arisen to this height, so perhaps would other
  young Mormons, have arisen. It needed only the situation, the climax, to
  focus these long-insulated, slow- developing and inquiring minds upon the
  truth&mdash;that one wife, one mother of children, for one man at one time as
  a law of nature, love, and righteousness. Shefford felt as if he were
  marching with the whole younger generation of Mormons, as if somehow he had
  been a humble instrument in the working out of their destiny, in the
  awakening that was to eliminate from their religion the only thing which kept
  it from being as good for man, and perhaps as true, as any other
  religion.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly he turned the corner of school-house to encounter Joe
  talking with the Mormon Henninger. Elder Smith was not present.</p>

  <p>"Why, hello, Ruth!" greeted Joe. "You've fetched Mary some dinner. Now
  that's good of you."</p>

  <p>"May I go in?" asked Ruth.</p>

  <p>"Reckon so," replied Henninger, scratching his head. He appeared to be
  tractable, and probably was good-natured under pleasant conditions. "She
  ought to have somethin' to eat. An' nobody 'pears&mdash;to have remembered
  that&mdash;we're so set up."</p>

  <p>He unbarred the huge, clumsy door and allowed Ruth to pass in.</p>

  <p>"Joe, you can go in if you want," he said. "But hurry out before Elder
  Smith comes back from his dinner."</p>

  <p>Joe mumbled something, gave a husky cough, and then went in.</p>

  <p>Shefford experienced great difficulty in presenting to this mild Mormon a
  natural and unagitated front. When all his internal structure seemed to be in
  a state of turmoil he did not see how it was possible to keep the fact from
  showing in his face. So he turned away and took aimless steps here and
  there.</p>

  <p>"'Pears like we'd hev rain," observed Henninger. "It's right warm an' them
  clouds are onseasonable."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Shefford. "Hope so. A little rain would be good for the
  grass."</p>

  <p>"Joe tells me Shadd rode in, an' some of his fellers."</p>

  <p>"So I see. About eight in the party."</p>

  <p>Shefford was gritting his teeth and preparing to endure the ordeal of
  controlling his mind and expression when the door opened and Joe stalked out.
  He had his sombrero pulled down so that it hid the upper half of his face.
  His lips were a shade off healthy color. He stood there with his back to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Say, what Mary needs is quiet&mdash;to be left alone," he said. "Ruth
  says if she rests, sleeps a little, she won't get fever... Henninger, don't
  let anybody disturb her till night."</p>

  <p>"All right, Joe," replied the Mormon. "An' I take it good of Ruth an' you
  to concern yourselves."</p>

  <p>A slight tap on the inside of the door sent Shefford's pulses to
  throbbing. Joe opened it with a strong and vigorous sweep that meant more
  than the mere action.</p>

  <p>"Ruth&mdash;reckon you didn't stay long," he said, and his voice rang
  clear. "Sure you feel sick and weak. Why, seeing her flustered even me!"</p>

  <p>A slender, dark-garbed woman wearing a long black hood stepped uncertainly
  out. She appeared to be Ruth. Shefford's heart stood still because she looked
  so like Ruth. But she did not step steadily, she seemed dazed, she did not
  raise the hooded head.</p>

  <p>"Go home," said Joe, and his voice rang a little louder. "Take her home,
  Shefford. Or, better, walk her round some. She's faintish... And see here,
  Henninger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Shefford led the girl away with a hand in apparent carelessness on her
  arm. After a few rods she walked with a freer step and then a swifter. He
  found it necessary to make that hold on her arm a real one, so as to keep her
  from walking too fast. No one, however, appeared to observe them. When they
  passed Ruth's house then Shefford began to lose his fear that this was not
  Fay Larkin. He was far from being calm or clear-sighted. He thought he
  recognized that free step; nevertheless, he could not make sure. When they
  passed under the trees, crossed the brook, and turned down along the west
  wall, then doubt ceased in Shefford's mind. He knew this was not Ruth. Still,
  so strange was his agitation, so keen his suspense, that he needed
  confirmation of ear, of eye. He wanted to hear her voice, to see her face.
  Yet just as strangely there was a twist of feeling, a reluctance, a sadness
  that kept off the moment.</p>

  <p>They reached the low, slow-swelling slant of wall and started to ascend.
  How impossible not to recognize Fay Larkin now in that swift grace and skill
  on the steep wall! Still, though he knew her, he perversely clung to the
  unreality of the moment. But when a long braid of dead-gold hair tumbled from
  under the hood, then his heart leaped. That identified Fay Larkin. He had
  freed her. He was taking her away. Then a sadness embittered his joy.</p>

  <p>As always before, she distanced him in the ascent to the top. She went on
  without looking back. But Shefford had an irresistible desire to took again
  and the last time at this valley where he had suffered and loved so much.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI.</a> &mdash; SURPRISE VALLEY</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM the summit of the wall the plateau waved away in red
  and yellow ridges, with here and there little valleys green with cedar and
  pinyon.</p>

  <p>Upon one of these ridges, silhouetted against the sky, appeared the
  stalking figure of the Indian. He had espied the fugitives. He disappeared in
  a niche, and presently came again into view round a corner of cliff. Here he
  waited, and soon Shefford and Fay joined him.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, it is well," he said.</p>

  <p>Shefford eagerly asked for the horses, and Nas Ta Bega silently pointed
  down the niche, which was evidently an opening into one of the shallow
  canyon. Then he led the way, walking swiftly. It was Shefford, and not Fay,
  who had difficulty in keeping close to him. This speed caused Shefford to
  become more alive to the business, instead of the feeling, of the flight. The
  Indian entered a crack between low cliffs&mdash;a very narrow canyon full of
  rocks and clumps of cedars&mdash;and in a half-hour or less he came to where
  the mustangs were halted among some cedars. Three of the mustangs, including
  Nack- yal, were saddled; one bore a small pack, and the remaining two had
  blankets strapped on their backs.</p>

  <p>"Fay, can you ride in that long skirt?" asked Shefford. How strange it
  seemed that his first words to her were practical when all his impassioned
  thought had been only mute! But the instant he spoke he experienced a relief,
  a relaxation.</p>

  <p>"I'll take it off," replied Fay, just as practically. And in a twinkling
  she slipped out of both waist and skirt. She had worn them over the short
  white- flannel dress with which Shefford had grown familiar.</p>

  <p>As Nack-yal appeared to be the safest mustang for her to ride, Shefford
  helped her upon him and then attended to the stirrups. When he had adjusted
  them to the proper length he drew the bridle over Nack-yal's head and, upon
  handing it to her, found himself suddenly looking into her face. She had
  taken off the hood, too. The instant there eyes met he realized that she was
  strangely afraid to meet his glance, as he was to meet hers. That seemed
  natural. But her face was flushed and there were unmistakable signs upon it
  of growing excitement, of mounting happiness. Save for that fugitive glance
  she would have been the Fay Larkin of yesterday. How he had expected her to
  look he did not know, but it was not like this. And never had he felt her
  strange quality of simplicity so powerfully.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been here&mdash;through this little canyon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, lots of times."</p>

  <p>"You'll be able to lead us to Surprise Valley, you think?"</p>

  <p>"I know it. I shall see Uncle Jim and Mother Jane before sunset!"</p>

  <p>"I hope&mdash;you do," he replied, a little shakily. "Perhaps we'd better
  not tell them of the&mdash;the&mdash;about what happened last night."</p>

  <p>Her beautiful, grave, and troubled glance returned to meet his, and he
  received a shock that he considered was amaze. And after more swift
  consideration he believed he was amazed because that look, instead of
  betraying fear or gloom or any haunting shadow of darkness, betrayed
  apprehension for him&mdash;grave, sweet, troubled love for him. She was not
  thinking of herself at all&mdash;of what he might think of her, of a possible
  gulf between them, of a vast and terrible change in the relation of soul to
  soul. He experienced a profound gladness. Though he could not understand her,
  he was happy that the horror of Waggoner's death had escaped her. He loved
  her, he meant to give his life to her, and right then and there he accepted
  the burden of her deed and meant to bear it without ever letting her know of
  the shadow between them.</p>

  <p>"Fay, we'll forget&mdash;what's behind us," he said. "Now to find Surprise
  Valley. Lead on. Nack-yal is gentle. Pull him the way you want to go. We'll
  follow."</p>

  <p>Shefford mounted the other saddled mustang, and they set off, Fay in
  advance. Presently they rode out of this canyon up to level cedar-patched,
  solid rock, and here Fay turned straight west. Evidently she had been over
  the ground before. The heights to which he had climbed with her were up to
  the left, great slopes and looming promontories. And the course she chose was
  as level and easy as any he could have picked out in that direction.</p>

  <p>When a mile or more of this up-and-down travel had been traversed Fay
  halted and appeared to be at fault. The plateau was losing its rounded,
  smooth, wavy characteristics, and to the west grew bolder, more rugged, more
  cut up into low crags and buttes. After a long, sweeping glance Fay headed
  straight for this rougher country. Thereafter from time to time she repeated
  this action.</p>

  <p>"Fay, how do you know you're going in the right direction?" asked
  Shefford, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I never forget any ground I've been over. I keep my eyes close ahead. All
  that seems strange to me is the wrong way. What I've seen, before must be the
  right way, because I saw it when they brought me from Surprise Valley."</p>

  <p>Shefford had to acknowledge that she was following an Indian's instinct
  for ground he had once covered.</p>

  <p>Still Shefford began to worry, and finally dropped back to question Nas Ta
  Bega.</p>

  <p>"Bi Nai, she has the eye of a Navajo," replied the Indian. "Look! Iron-
  shod horses have passed here. See the marks in the stone?"</p>

  <p>Shefford indeed made out faint cut tracks that would have escaped his own
  sight. They had been made long ago, but they were unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"She's following the trail by memory&mdash;she must remember the stones,
  trees, sage, cactus," said Shefford in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Pictures in her mind," replied the Indian.</p>

  <p>Thereafter the farther she progressed the less at fault she appeared and
  the faster she traveled. She made several miles an hour, and about the middle
  of the afternoon entered upon the more broken region of the plateau. View
  became restricted. Low walls, and ruined cliffs of red rock with cedars at
  their base, and gullies growing into canyon and canyon opening into larger
  ones&mdash;these were passed and crossed and climbed and rimmed in travel
  that grew more difficult as the going became wilder. Then there was a steady
  ascent, up and up all the time, though not steep, until another level, green
  with cedar and pinyon, was reached.</p>

  <p>It reminded Shefford of the forest near the mouth of the Sagi. It was so
  dense he could not see far ahead of Fay, and often he lost sight of her
  entirely. Presently he rode out of the forest into a strip of purple sage. It
  ended abruptly, and above that abrupt line, seemingly far away, rose a long,
  red wall. Instantly he recognized that to be the opposite wall of a canyon
  which as yet he could not see.</p>

  <p>Fay was acting strangely and he hurried forward. She slipped off Nack-yal
  and fell, sprang up and ran wildly, to stand upon a promontory, her arms
  uplifted, her hair a mass of moving gold in the wind, her attitude one of
  wild and eloquent significance.</p>

  <p>Shefford ran, too, and as he ran the red wall in his eager sight seemed to
  enlarge downward, deeper and deeper, and then it merged into a strip of
  green.</p>

  <p>Suddenly beneath him yawned a red-walled gulf, a deceiving gulf seen
  through transparent haze, a softly shining green-and-white valley, strange,
  wild, beautiful, like a picture in his memory.</p>

  <p>"Surprise Valley!" he cried, in wondering recognition.</p>

  <p>Fay Larkin waved her arms as if they were wings to carry her swiftly
  downward, and her plaintive cry fitted the wildness of her manner and the
  lonely height where she leaned.</p>

  <p>Shefford drew her back from the rim.</p>

  <p>"Fay, we are here," he said. "I recognize the valley. I miss only one
  thing&mdash;the arch of stone."</p>

  <p>His words seemed to recall her to reality.</p>

  <p>"The arch? That fell when the wall slipped, in the great avalanche. See!
  There is the place. We can get down there. Oh, let us hurry!"</p>

  <p>The Indian reached the rim and his falcon gaze swept the valley. "Ugh!" he
  exclaimed. He, too, recognized the valley that he had vainly sought for half
  a year.</p>

  <p>"Bring the lassos," said Shefford.</p>

  <p>With Fay leading, they followed the rim toward the head of the valley.
  Here the wall had caved in, and there was a slope of jumbled rock a thousand
  feet wide and more than that in depth. It was easy to descend because there
  were so many rocks waist-high that afforded a handhold. Shefford marked,
  however, that Fay never took advantage of these. More than once he paused to
  watch her. Swiftly she went down; she stepped from rock to rock; lightly she
  crossed cracks and pits; she ran along the sharp and broken edge of a long
  ledge; she poised on a pointed stone and, sure-footed as a mountain-sheep,
  she sprang to another that had scarce surface for a foothold; her moccasins
  flashed, seemed to hold wondrously on any angle; and when a rock tipped or
  slipped with her she leaped to a surer stand. Shefford watched her
  performance, so swift, agile, so perfectly balanced, showing such wonderful
  accord between eye and foot; and then when he swept his gaze down upon that
  wild valley where she had roamed alone for twelve years he marveled no
  more.</p>

  <p>The farther down he got the greater became the size of rocks, until he
  found himself amid huge pieces of cliff as large as houses. He lost sight of
  Fay entirely, and he anxiously threaded a narrow, winding, descending way
  between the broken masses. Finally he came out upon flat rock again. Fay
  stood on another rim, looking down. He saw that the slide had moved far out
  into the valley, and the lower part of it consisted of great sections of
  wall. In fact, the base of the great wall had just moved out with the
  avalanche, and this much of it held its vertical position. Looking upward,
  Shefford was astounded and thrilled to see how far he had descended, how the
  walls leaned like a great, wide, curving, continuous rim of mountain.</p>

  <p>"Here! Here!" called Fay. "Here's where they got down&mdash;where they
  brought me up. Here are the sticks they used. They stuck them in this crack,
  down to that ledge."</p>

  <p>Shefford ran to her side and looked down. There was a narrow split in this
  section of wall and it was perhaps sixty feet in depth. The floor of rock
  below led out in a ledge, with a sheer drop to the valley level.</p>

  <p>As Shefford gazed, pondering on a way to descend lower, the Indian reached
  his side. He had no sooner looked than he proceeded to act. Selecting one of
  the sticks, which were strong pieces of cedar, well hewn and trimmed, he
  jammed it between the walls of the crack till it stuck fast. Then sitting
  astride this one he jammed in another some three feet below. When he got down
  upon that one it was necessary for Shefford to drop him a third stick. In a
  comparatively short time the Indian reached the ledge below. Then he called
  for the lassos. Shefford threw them down. His next move was an attempt to
  assist Fay, but she slipped out of his grasp and descended the ladder with a
  swiftness that made him hold his breath. Still, when his turn came, her
  spirit so governed him that he went down as swiftly, and even leaped sheer
  the last ten feet.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega and Fay were leaning over the ledge.</p>

  <p>"Here's the place," she said, excitedly. "Let me down on the rope."</p>

  <p>It took two thirty-foot lassos tied together to reach the floor of the
  valley. Shefford folded his vest, put it round Fay, and slipped a loop of the
  lasso under her arms. Then he and Nas Ta Bega lowered her to the grass below.
  Fay, throwing off the loop, bounded away like a wild creature, uttering the
  strangest cries he had ever heard, and she disappeared along the wall.</p>

  <p>"I'll go down," said Shefford to the Indian. "You stay here to help pull
  us up."</p>

  <p>Hand over hand Shefford descended, and when his feet touched the grass he
  experienced a shock of the most singular exultation.</p>

  <p>"In Surprise Valley!" he breathed, softly. The dream that had come to him
  with his friend's story, the years of waiting, wondering, and then the long,
  fruitless, hopeless search in the desert uplands&mdash;these were in his mind
  as he turned along the wall where Fay had disappeared. He faced a wide
  terrace, green with grass and moss and starry with strange white flowers, and
  dark- foliaged, spear-pointed spruce-trees. Below the terrace sloped a bench
  covered with thick copse, and this merged into a forest of dwarf oaks, and
  beyond that was a beautiful strip of white aspens, their leaves quivering in
  the stillness. The air was close, sweet, warm, fragrant, and remarkably dry.
  It reminded him of the air he had smelled in dry caves under cliffs. He
  reached a point from where he saw a meadow dotted with red-and-white-spotted
  cattle and little black burros. There were many of them. And he remembered
  with a start the agony of toil and peril Venters had endured bringing the
  progenitors of this stock into the valley. What a strange, wild, beautiful
  story it all was! But a story connected with this valley could not have been
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>Beyond the meadow, on the other side of the valley, extended the forest,
  and that ended in the rising bench of thicket, which gave place to green
  slope and mossy terrace of sharp-tipped spruces&mdash;and all this led the
  eye irresistibly up to the red wall where a vast, dark, wonderful cavern
  yawned, with its rust-colored streaks of stain on the wall, and the queer
  little houses of the cliff-dwellers, with their black, vacant, silent windows
  speaking so weirdly of the unknown past.</p>

  <p>Shefford passed a place where the ground had been cultivated, but not as
  recently as the last six months. There was a scant shock of corn and many
  meager standing stalks. He became aware of a low, whining hum and a fragrance
  overpowering in its sweetness. And there round another corner of wall he came
  upon an orchard all pink and white in blossom and melodious with the buzz and
  hum of innumerable bees.</p>

  <p>He crossed a little stream that had been dammed, went along a pond, down
  beside an irrigation-ditch that furnished water to orchard and vineyard, and
  from there he strode into a beautiful cove between two jutting corners of red
  wall. It was level and green and the spruces stood gracefully everywhere.
  Beyond their dark trunks he saw caves in the wall.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the fragrance of blossom was overwhelmed by the stronger
  fragrance of smoke from a wood fire. Swiftly he strode under the spruces.
  Quail fluttered before him as tame as chickens. Big gray rabbits scarcely
  moved out of his way. The branches above him were full of mockingbirds. And
  then&mdash;there before him stood three figures.</p>

  <p>Fay Larkin was held close to the side of a magnificent woman, barbarously
  clad in garments made of skins and pieces of blanket. Her face worked in
  noble emotion. Shefford seemed to see the ghost of that fair beauty Venters
  had said was Jane Withersteen's. Her hair was gray. Near her stood a lean,
  stoop- shouldered man whose long hair was perfectly white. His gaunt face was
  bare of beard. It had strange, sloping, sad lines. And he was staring with
  mild, surprised eyes.</p>

  <p>The moment held Shefford mute till sight of Fay Larkin's tear-wet face
  broke the spell. He leaped forward and his strong hands reached for the woman
  and the man.</p>

  <p>"Jane Withersteen!... Lassiter! I have found you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, who are you?" she cried, with rich and deep and quivering voice.
  "This child came running&mdash;screaming. She could not speak. We thought she
  had gone mad&mdash;and escaped to come back to us."</p>

  <p>"I am John Shefford," he replied, swiftly. "I am a friend of Bern Venters
  &mdash;of his wife Bess. I learned your story. I came west. I've searched a
  year. I found Fay. And we've come to take you away."</p>

  <p>"You found Fay? But that masked Mormon who forced her to sacrifice herself
  to save us!... What of him? It's not been so many long years&mdash;I remember
  what my father was&mdash;and Dyer and Tull&mdash;all those cruel
  churchmen."</p>

  <p>"Waggoner is dead," replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Dead? She is free! Oh, what&mdash;how did he die?"</p>

  <p>"He was killed."</p>

  <p>"Who did it?"</p>

  <p>"That's no matter," replied Shefford, stonily, and he met her gaze with
  steady eyes. "He's out of the way. Fay was never his wife. Fay's free. We've
  come to take you out of the country. We must hurry. We'll be tracked&mdash;
  pursued. But we've horses and an Indian guide. We'll get away... I think it
  better to leave here at once. There's no telling how soon we'll be hunted.
  Get what things you want to take with you."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;Mother Jane, let us hurry!" cried Fay. "I'm so
  full&mdash;I can't talk&mdash;my heart hurts so!"</p>

  <p>Jane Withersteen's face shone with an exceedingly radiant light, and a
  glory blended with a terrible fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Fay! my little Fay!"</p>

  <p>Lassiter had stood there with his mild, clear blue eyes upon Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I shore am glad to see you&mdash;all," he drawled, and extended his hand
  as if the meeting were casual. "What'd you say your name was?"</p>

  <p>Shefford repeated it as he met the proffered hand.</p>

  <p>"How's Bern an' Bess?" Lassiter inquired.</p>

  <p>"They were well, prosperous, happy when last I saw them... They had a
  baby."</p>

  <p>"Now ain't thet fine?... Jane, did you hear? Bess has a baby. An', Jane,
  didn't I always say Bern would come back to get us out? Shore it's just the
  same."</p>

  <p>How cool, easy, slow, and mild this Lassiter seemed! Had the man grown
  old, Shefford wondered? The past to him manifestly was only yesterday, and
  the danger of the present was as nothing. Looking in Lassiter's face,
  Shefford was baffled. If he had not remembered the greatness of this old
  gun-man he might have believed that the lonely years in the valley had
  unbalanced his mind. In an hour like this coolness seemed inexplicable
  &mdash;assuredly would have been impossible in an ordinary man. Yet what hid
  behind that drawling coolness? What was the meaning of those long, sloping,
  shadowy lines of the face? What spirit lay in the deep, mild, clear eyes?
  Shefford experienced a sudden check to what had been his first growing
  impression of a drifting, broken old man.</p>

  <p>"Lassiter, pack what little you can carry&mdash;mustn't be much&mdash; and
  we'll get out of here," said Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I shore will. Reckon I ain't a-goin' to need a pack-train. We saved the
  clothes we wore in here. Jane never thought it no use. But I figgered we
  might need them some day. They won't be stylish, but I reckon they'll do
  better 'n these skins. An' there's an old coat thet was Venters's."</p>

  <p>The mild, dreamy look became intensified in Lassiter's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did Venters have any hosses when you knowed him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He had a farm full of horses," replied Shefford, with a smile. "And there
  were two blacks&mdash;the grandest horses I ever saw. Black Star and Night!
  You remember, Lassiter?"</p>

  <p>"Shore. I was wonderin' if he got the blacks out. They must be growin' old
  by now... Grand hosses, they was. But Jane had another hoss, a big devil of a
  sorrel. His name was Wrangle. Did Venters ever tell you about him&mdash; an'
  thet race with Jerry Card?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred times!" replied Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Wrangle run the blacks off their legs. But Jane never would believe thet.
  An' I couldn't change her all these years... Reckon mebbe we'll get to see
  them blacks?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I hope&mdash;I believe you will," replied Shefford,
  feelingly.</p>

  <p>"Shore won't thet be fine. Jane, did you hear? Black Star an' Night are
  livin' an' we'll get to see them."</p>

  <p>But Jane Withersteen only clasped Fay in her arms, and looked at Lassiter
  with wet and glistening eyes.</p>

  <p>Shefford told them to hurry and come to the cliff where the ascent from
  the valley was to be made. He thought best to leave them alone to make their
  preparations and bid farewell to the cavern home they had known for so
  long.</p>

  <p>Then he strolled back along the wall, loitering here to gaze into a cave,
  and there to study crude red paintings in the nooks. And sometimes he halted
  thoughtfully and did not see anything. At length he rounded a corner of cliff
  to espy Nas Ta Bega sitting upon the ledge, reposeful and watchful as usual.
  Shefford told the Indian they would be climbing out soon, and then he sat
  down to wait and let his gaze rove over the valley.</p>

  <p>He might have sat there a long while, so sad and reflective and wondering
  was his thought, but it seemed a very short time till Fay came in sight with
  her free, swift grace, and Lassiter and Jane some distance behind. Jane
  carried a small bundle and Lassiter had a sack over his shoulder that
  appeared no inconsiderable burden.</p>

  <p>"Them beans shore is heavy," he drawled, as he deposited the sack upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Shefford curiously took hold of the sack and was amazed to find that a
  second and hard muscular effort was required to lift it.</p>

  <p>"Beans?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Shore," replied Lassiter.</p>

  <p>"That's the heaviest sack of beans I ever saw. Why&mdash;it's not possible
  it can be... Lassiter, we've a long, rough trail. We've got to pack
  light&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wal, I ain't a-goin' to leave this here sack behind. Reckon I've been all
  of twelve years in fillin' it," he declared, mildly.</p>

  <p>Shefford could only stare at him.</p>

  <p>"Fay may need them beans," went on Lassiter.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because they're gold."</p>

  <p>"Gold!" ejaculated Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Shore. An' they represent some work. Twelve years of diggin' an'
  washin'!"</p>

  <p>Shefford laughed constrainedly. "Well, Lassiter, that alters the case
  considerably. A sack of gold nuggets or grains, or beans, as you call them,
  certainly must not be left behind... Come, now, we'll tackle this climbing
  job."</p>

  <p>He called up to the Indian and, grasping the rope, began to walk up the
  first slant, and then by dint of hand-over-hand effort and climbing with
  knees and feet he succeeded, with Nas Ta Bega's help, in making the ledge.
  Then he let down the rope to haul up the sack and bundle. That done, he
  directed Fay to fasten the noose round her as he had fixed it before. When
  she had complied he called to her to hold herself out from the wall while he
  and Nas Ta Bega hauled her up.</p>

  <p>"Hold the rope tight," replied Fay, "I'll walk up."</p>

  <p>And to Shefford's amaze and admiration, she virtually walked up that
  almost perpendicular wall by slipping her hands along the rope and stepping
  as she pulled herself up. There, if never before, he saw the fruit of her
  years of experience on steep slopes. Only such experience could have made the
  feat possible.</p>

  <p>Jane had to be hauled up, and the task was a painful one for her.
  Lassiter's turn came then, and he showed more strength and agility than
  Shefford had supposed him capable of. From the ledge they turned their
  attention to the narrow crack with its ladder of sticks. Fay had already
  ascended and now hung over the rim, her white face and golden hair framed
  vividly in the narrow stream of blue sky above.</p>

  <p>"Mother Jane! Uncle Jim! You are so slow," she called.</p>

  <p>"Wal, Fay, we haven't been second cousins to a canyon squirrel all these
  years," replied Lassiter.</p>

  <p>This upper half of the climb bid fair to be as difficult for Jane, if not
  so painful, as the lower. It was necessary for the Indian to go up and drop
  the rope, which was looped around her, and then, with him pulling from above
  and Shefford assisting Jane as she climbed, she was finally gotten up without
  mishap. When Lassiter reached the level they rested a little while and then
  faced the great slide of jumbled rocks. Fay led the way, light, supple,
  tireless, and Shefford never ceased looking at her. At last they surmounted
  the long slope and, winding along the rim, reached the point where Fay had
  led out of the cedars.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega, then, was the one to whom Shefford looked for every decision
  or action of the immediate future. The Indian said he had seen a pool of
  water in a rocky hole, that the day was spent, that here was a little grass
  for the mustangs, and it would be well to camp right there. So while Nas Ta
  Bega attended to the mustangs Shefford set about such preparations for camp
  and supper as their light pack afforded. The question of beds was easily
  answered, for the mats of soft needles under pinyon and cedar would be
  comfortable places to sleep.</p>

  <p>When Shefford felt free again the sun was setting. Lassiter and Jane were
  walking under the trees. The Indian had returned to camp. But Fay was
  missing. Shefford imagined he knew where to find her, and upon going to the
  edge of the forest he saw her sitting on the promontory. He approached her,
  drawn in spite of a feeling that perhaps he ought to stay away.</p>

  <p>"Fay, would you rather be alone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>His voice startled her.</p>

  <p>"I want you," she replied, and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>Taking it in his own, he sat beside her.</p>

  <p>The red sun was at their backs. Surprise Valley lay hazy, dusky, shadowy
  beneath them. The opposite wall seemed fired by crimson flame, save far down
  at its base, which the sun no longer touched. And the dark line of red slowly
  rose, encroaching upon the bright crimson. Changing, transparent, yet dusky
  veils seemed to float between the walls; long, red rays, where the sun shone
  through notch or crack in the rim, split the darker spaces; deep down at the
  floor the forest darkened, the strip of aspen paled, the meadow turned gray;
  and all under the shelves and in the great caverns a purple gloom deepened.
  Then the sun set. And swiftly twilight was there below while day lingered
  above. On the opposite wall the fire died and the stone grew cold.</p>

  <p>A canyon night-hawk voiced his lonely, weird, and melancholy cry, and it
  seemed to pierce and mark the silence.</p>

  <p>A pale star, peering out of a sky that had begun to turn blue, marked the
  end of twilight. And all the purple shadows moved and hovered and changed
  till, softly and mysteriously, they embraced black night.</p>

  <p>Beautiful, wild, strange, silent Surprise Valley! Shefford saw it before
  and beneath him, a dark abyss now, the abode of loneliness. He imagined
  faintly what was in Fay Larkin's heart. For the last time she had seen the
  sun set there and night come with its dead silence and sweet mystery and
  phantom shadows, its velvet blue sky and white trains of stars.</p>

  <p>He, who had dreamed and longed and searched, found that the hour had been
  incalculable for him in its import.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII.</a> &mdash; THE TRAIL TO NONNEZOSHE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Shefford awoke next morning and sat up on his bed of
  pinyon boughs the dawn had broken cold with a ruddy gold brightness under the
  trees. Nas Ta Bega and Lassiter were busy around a camp-fire; the mustangs
  were haltered near by; Jane Withersteen combed out her long, tangled tresses
  with a crude wooden comb; and Fay Larkin was not in sight. As she had been
  missing from the group at sunset, so she was now at sunrise. Shefford went
  out to take his last look at Surprise Valley.</p>

  <p>On the evening before the valley had been a place of dusky red veils and
  purple shadows, and now it was pink-walled, clear and rosy and green and
  white, with wonderful shafts of gold slanting down from the notched eastern
  rim. Fay stood on the promontory, and Shefford did not break the spell of her
  silent farewell to her wild home. A strange emotion abided with him and he
  knew he would always, all his life, regret leaving Surprise Valley.</p>

  <p>Then the Indian called.</p>

  <p>"Come, Fay," said Shefford, gently.</p>

  <p>And she turned away with dark, haunted eyes and a white, still face.</p>

  <p>The somber Indian gave a silent gesture for Shefford to make haste. While
  they had breakfast the mustangs were saddled and packed. And soon all was in
  readiness for the flight. Fay was given Nack-yal, Jane the saddled horse
  Shefford had ridden, and Lassiter the Indian's roan. Shefford and Nas Ta Bega
  were to ride the blanketed mustangs, and the sixth and last one bore the
  pack. Nas Ta Bega set off, leading this horse; the others of the party lined
  in behind, with Shefford at the rear.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega led at a brisk trot, and sometimes, on level stretches of
  ground, at an easy canter; and Shefford had a grim realization of what this
  flight was going to be for these three fugitives, now so unaccustomed to
  riding. Jane and Lassiter, however, needed no watching, and showed they had
  never forgotten how to manage a horse. The Indian back-trailed yesterday's
  path for an hour, then headed west to the left, and entered a low pass. All
  parts of this plateau country looked alike, and Shefford was at some pains to
  tell the difference of this strange ground from that which he had been over.
  In another hour they got out of the rugged, broken rock to the wind-worn and
  smooth, shallow canyon. Shefford calculated that they were coming to the end
  of the plateau. The low walls slanted lower; the canyon made a turn; Nas Ta
  Bega disappeared; and then the others of the party. When Shefford turned the
  corner of wall he saw a short strip of bare, rocky ground with only sky
  beyond. The Indian and his followers had halted in a group. Shefford rode to
  them, halted himself, and in one sweeping glance realized the meaning of
  their silent gaze. But immediately Nas Ta Bega started down; and the
  mustangs, without word or touch, followed him. Shefford, however, lingered on
  the promontory.</p>

  <p>His gaze seemed impelled and held by things afar&mdash;the great yellow-
  and-purple corrugated world of distance, now on a level with his eyes. He was
  drawn by the beauty and the grandeur of that scene and transfixed by the
  realization that he had dared to venture to find a way through this vast,
  wild, and upflung fastness. He kept looking afar, sweeping the
  three-quartered circle of horizon till his judgment of distance was
  confounded and his sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the
  next. Then he withdrew his fascinated gaze to adopt the Indian's method of
  studying unlimited spaces in the desert&mdash;to look with slow, contracted
  eyes from near to far.</p>

  <p>His companions had begun to zigzag down a long slope, bare of rock, with
  yellow gravel patches showing between the scant strips of green, and here and
  there a scrub-cedar. Half a mile down, the slope merged into green level. But
  close, keen gaze made out this level to be a rolling plain, growing darker
  green, with blue lines of ravines, and thin, undefined spaces that might be
  mirage. Miles and miles it swept and relied and heaved to lose its waves in
  apparent darker level. A round, red rock stood isolated, marking the end of
  the barren plain, and farther on were other round rocks, all isolated, all of
  different shape. They resembled huge grazing cattle. But as Shefford gazed,
  and his sight gained strength from steadily holding it to separate features
  these rocks were strangely magnified. They grew and grew into mounds,
  castles, domes, crags&mdash;great, red, wind-carved buttes. One by one they
  drew his gaze to the wall of upflung rock. He seemed to see a thousand domes
  of a thousand shapes and colors, and among them a thousand blue clefts, each
  one a little mark in his sight, yet which he knew was a canyon. So far he
  gained some idea of what he saw. But beyond this wide area of curved lines
  rose another wall, dwarfing the lower, dark red, horizon&mdash;long,
  magnificent in frowning boldness, and because of its limitless deceiving
  surfaces, breaks, and lines, incomprehensible to the sight of man. Away to
  the eastward began a winding, ragged, blue line, looping back upon itself,
  and then winding away again, growing wider and bluer. This line was the San
  Juan Canyon. Where was Joe Lake at that moment? Had he embarked yet on the
  river&mdash;did that blue line, so faint, so deceiving, hold him and the
  boat? Almost it was impossible to believe. Shefford followed the blue line
  all its length, a hundred miles, he fancied, down toward the west where it
  joined a dark, purple, shadowy cleft. And this was the Grand Canyon of the
  Colorado. Shefford's eye swept along with that winding mark, farther and
  farther to the west, round to the left, until the cleft, growing larger and
  coming closer, losing its deception, was seen to be a wild and winding
  canyon. Still farther to the left, as he swung in fascinated gaze, it split
  the wonderful wall&mdash;a vast plateau now with great red peaks and yellow
  mesas. The canyon was full of purple smoke. It turned, it gaped, it lost
  itself and showed again in that chaos of a million cliffs. And then farther
  on it became again a cleft, a purple line, at last to fail entirely in
  deceiving distance.</p>

  <p>Shefford imagined there was no scene in all the world to equal that. The
  tranquillity of lesser spaces was not here manifest. Sound, movement, life,
  seemed to have no fitness here. Ruin was there and desolation and decay. The
  meaning of the ages was flung at him, and a man became nothing. When he had
  gazed at the San Juan Canyon he had been appalled at the nature of Joe Lake's
  Herculean task. He had lost hope, faith. The thing was not possible. But when
  Shefford gazed at that sublime and majestic wilderness, in which the Grand
  Canyon was only a dim line, he strangely lost his terror and something else
  came to him from across the shining spaces. If Nas Ta Bega led them safely
  down to the river, if Joe Lake met them at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco, if
  they survived the rapids of that terrible gorge, then Shefford would have to
  face his soul and the meaning of this spirit that breathed on the wind.</p>

  <p>He urged his mustang to the descent of the slope, and as he went down,
  slowly drawing nearer to the other fugitives, his mind alternated between
  this strange intimation of faith, this subtle uplift of hid spirit, and the
  growing gloom and shadow in his love for Fay Larkin. Not that he loved her
  less, but more! A possible God hovering near him, like the Indian's
  spirit-step on the trail, made his soul the darker for Fay's crime, and he
  saw with light, with deeper sadness, with sterner truth.</p>

  <p>More than once the Indian turned on his mustang to look up the slope and
  the light flashed from his dark, somber face. Shefford instinctively looked
  back himself, and then realized the unconscious motive of the action. Deep
  within him there had been a premonition of certain pursuit, and the Indian's
  reiterated backward glance had at length brought the feeling upward.
  Thereafter, as they descended, Shefford gradually added to his already
  wrought emotions a mounting anxiety.</p>

  <p>No sign of a trail showed where the base of the slope rolled out to meet
  the green plain. The earth was gravelly, with dark patches of heavy silt,
  almost like cinders; and round, black rocks, flinty and glassy, cracked away
  from the hoofs of the mustangs. There was a level bench a mile wide, then a
  ravine, and then an ascent, and after that, rounded ridge and ravine, one
  after the other, like huge swells of a monstrous sea. Indian paint-brush vied
  in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus. There was no sage.
  Soapweed and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and there lent the green
  to that barren; and it was green only at a distance. Nas Ta Bega kept on a
  steady, even trot. The sun climbed. The wind rose and whipped dust from under
  the mustangs.</p>

  <p>Shefford looked back often, and the farther out in the plain he reached
  the higher loomed the plateau they had descended; and as he faced ahead again
  the lower sank the red-domed and castled horizon to the fore. The ravines
  became deeper, with dry rock bottoms, and the ridge-tops sharper, with
  outcroppings of yellow, crumbling ledges. Once across the central depression
  of that plain a gradual ascent became evident, and the round rocks grew
  clearer in sight, began to rise shine and grow. And thereafter every slope
  brought them nearer.</p>

  <p>The sun was straight overhead and hot when Nas Ta Bega halted the party
  under the first lonely scrub-cedar. They all dismounted to stretch their
  limbs, and rest the horses. It was not a talkative group, Lassiter's comments
  on the never-ending green plain elicited no response. Jane Withersteen looked
  afar with the past in her eyes. Shefford felt Fay's wistful glance and could
  not meet it; indeed, he seemed to want to hide something from her. The Indian
  bent a falcon gaze on the distant slope, and Shefford did not like that
  intent, searching, steadfast watchfulness. Suddenly Nas Ta Bega stiffened and
  whipped the halter he held.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>All eyes followed the direction of his dark hand. Puffs of dust rose from
  the base of the long slope they had descended; tiny dark specks moved with
  the pace of a snail.</p>

  <p>"Shadd!" added the Indian.</p>

  <p>"I expected it," said Shefford, darkly, as he rose.</p>

  <p>"An' who's Shadd?" drawled Lassiter in his cool, slow speech.</p>

  <p>Briefly Shefford explained, and then, looking at Nas Ta Bega, he
  added:</p>

  <p>"The hardest-riding outfit in the country! We can't get away from
  them."</p>

  <p>Jane Withersteen was silent, but Fay uttered a low cry. Shefford did not
  look at either of them. The Indian began swiftly to tighten the
  saddle-cinches of his roan, and Shefford did likewise for Nack-yal. Then
  Shefford drew his rifle out of the saddle-sheath and Joe Lake's big guns from
  the saddle-bag.</p>

  <p>"Here, Lassiter, maybe you haven't forgotten how to use these," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The old gun-man started as if he had seen ghosts. His hands grew clawlike
  as he reached for the guns. He threw open the cylinders, spilled out the
  shells, snapped back the cylinders. Then he went through motions too swift
  for Shefford to follow. But Shefford heard the hammers falling so swiftly
  they blended their clicks almost in one sound. Lassiter reloaded the guns
  with a speed comparable with the other actions. A remarkable transformation
  had come over him. He did not seem the same man. The mild eyes had changed;
  the long, shadowy, sloping lines were tense cords; and there was a cold, ashy
  shade on his face,</p>

  <p>"Twelve years!" he muttered to himself. "I dropped them old guns back
  there where I rolled the rock... Twelve years!"</p>

  <p>Shefford realized the twelve years were as if they had never been. And he
  would rather have had this old gun-man with him than a dozen ordinary
  men.</p>

  <p>The Indian spoke rapidly in Navajo, saying that once in the rocks they
  were safe. Then, after another look at the distant dust-puffs, he wheeled his
  mustang.</p>

  <p>It was doubtful if the party could have kept near him had they been
  responsible for the gait of their mounts. The fact was that the way the
  called to his mustang or some leadership in the one rode drew the others to a
  like trot or climb or canter. For a long time Shefford did not turn round; he
  knew what to expect. And when he did turn he was startled at the gain made by
  the pursuers. But he was encouraged as well by the looming, red, rounded
  peaks seemingly now so close. He could see the dark splits between the
  sloping curved walls, the pinyon patches in the amphitheater under the
  circled walls. That was a wild place they were approaching, and, once in
  there, he believed pursuit would be useless. However, there were miles to go
  still, and those hard-riding devils behind made alarming decrease in the
  intervening distance. Shefford could see the horses plainly now. How they
  made the dust fly! He counted up to six&mdash;and then the dust and moving
  line caused the others to be indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>At last only a long, gently rising slope separated the fugitives from that
  labyrinthine network of wildly carved rock. But it was the clear air that
  made the distance seem short. Mile after mile the mustangs climbed, and when
  they were perhaps half-way across that last slope to the rocks the first
  horse of the pursuers mounted to the level behind. In a few moments the whole
  band was strung out in sight. Nas Ta Bega kept his mustang at a steady walk,
  in spite of the gaining pursuers. There came a point, however, when the
  Indian, reaching comparatively level ground, put his mount to a swinging
  canter. The other mustangs broke into the same gait.</p>

  <p>It became a race then, with the couple of miles between fugitives and
  pursuers only imperceptibly lessened. Nas Ta Bega had saved his mustangs and
  Shadd had ridden his to the limit. Shefford kept looking back, gripping his
  rifle, hoping it would not come to a fight, yet slowly losing that
  reluctance.</p>

  <p>Sage began to show on the slope, and other kinds of brush and cedars
  straggled everywhere. The great rocks loomed closer, the red color mixed with
  yellow, and the slopes lengthening out, not so steep, yet infinitely longer
  than they had seemed at a distance.</p>

  <p>Shefford ceased to feel the dry wind in his face. They were already in the
  lee of the wall. He could see the rock-squirrels scampering to their holes.
  The mustangs valiantly held to the gait, and at last the Indian disappeared
  between two rounded comers of cliff. The others were close behind. Shefford
  wheeled once more. Shadd and his gang were a mile in the rear, but coming
  fast, despite winded horses.</p>

  <p>Shefford rode around the wall into a widening space thick with cedars. It
  ended in a bare slope of smooth rock. Here the Indian dismounted. When the
  others came up with him he told them to lead their horses and follow. Then he
  began the ascent of the rock.</p>

  <p>It was smooth and hard, though not slippery. There was not a crack.
  Shefford did not see a broken piece of stone. Nas Ta Bega climbed straight up
  for a while, and then wound around a swell, to turn this way and that, always
  going up. Shefford began to see similar mounds of rock all around him, of
  every shape that could be called a curve. There were yellow domes far above,
  and small red domes far below. Ridges ran from one hill of rock to another.
  There were no abrupt breaks, but holes and pits and caves were everywhere,
  and occasionally, deep down, an amphitheater green with cedar and pinyon. The
  Indian appeared to have a clear idea of where he wanted to go, though there
  was no vestige of a trail on those bare slopes. At length Shefford was high
  enough to see back upon the plain, but the pursuers were no longer in
  sight.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega led to the top of that wall, only to disclose to his followers
  another and a higher wall beyond, with a ridged, bare, wild, and scalloped
  depression between. Here footing began to be precarious for both man and
  beast. When the ascent of the second wall began it was necessary to zigzag
  up, slowly and carefully, taking advantage of every level bulge or
  depression. They must have consumed half an hour mounting this slope to the
  summit. Once there, Shefford drew a sharp breath with both backward and
  forward glances. Shadd and his gang, in single file, showed dark upon the
  bare stone ridge behind. And to the fore there twisted and dropped and curved
  the most dangerous slopes Shefford had ever seen. The fugitives had reached
  the height of stone wall, of the divide, and many of the drops upon this side
  were perpendicular and too steep to see the bottom.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega led along the ridge-top and then started down, following the
  waves in the rock. He came out upon a round promontory from which there could
  not have been any turning of a horse. The long slant leading down was at an
  angle Shefford declared impossible for the animals. Yet the Indian started
  down. His mustang needed urging, but at last edged upon the steep descent.
  Shefford and the others had to hold back and wait. It was thrilling to see
  the intelligent mustang. He did not step. He slid his fore hoofs a few inches
  at a time and kept directly behind the Indian. If he fell he would knock Nas
  Ta Bega off his feet and they would both roll down together. There was no
  doubt in Shefford's mind that the mustang knew this as well as the Indian.
  Foot by foot they worked down to a swelling bulge, and here Nas Ta Bega left
  his mustang and came back for the pack-horse. It was even more difficult to
  get this beast down. Then the Indian called for Lassiter and Jane and Fay to
  come down. Shefford began to keep a sharp lookout behind and above, and did
  not see how the three fared on the slope, but evidently there was no mishap.
  Nas Ta Bega mounted the slope again, and at the moment sight of Shadd's dark
  bays silhouetted against the sky caused Shefford to call out:</p>

  <p>"We've got to hurry!"</p>

  <p>The Indian led one mustang and called to the others. Shefford stepped
  close behind. They went down in single file, inch by inch, foot by foot, and
  safely reached the comparative level below.</p>

  <p>"Shadd's gang are riding their horses up and down these walls!" exclaimed
  Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Shore," replied Lassiter.</p>

  <p>Both the women were silent.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega led the way swiftly to the right. He rounded a huge dome,
  climbed a low, rolling ridge, descended and ascended, and came out upon the
  rim of a steep-walled amphitheater. Along the rim was a yard-wide level, with
  the chasm to the left and steep slope to the right. There was no time to
  flinch at the danger, when an even greater danger menaced from the rear. Nas
  Ta Bega led, and his mustang kept at his heels. One misstep would have
  plunged the animal to his death. But he was surefooted and his confidence
  helped the others. At the apex of the curve the only course led away from the
  rim, and here there was no level. Four of the mustangs slipped and slid down
  the smooth rock until they stopped in a shallow depression. It cost time to
  get them out, to straighten pack and saddles. Shefford thought he heard a
  yell in the rear, but he could not see anything of the gang.</p>

  <p>They rounded this precipice only to face a worse one. Shefford's nerve was
  sorely tried when he saw steep slants everywhere, all apparently leading down
  into chasms, and no place a man, let alone a horse, could put a foot with
  safety. Nevertheless the imperturbable Indian never slacked his pace. Always
  he appeared to find a way, and he never had to turn back. His winding course,
  however, did not now cover much distance in a straight line, and herein lay
  the greatest peril. Any moment Shadd and his men might come within range.</p>

  <p>Upon a particularly tedious and dangerous side of rocky hill the fugitives
  lost so much time that Shefford grew exceedingly alarmed. Still, they
  accomplished it without accident, and their pursuers did not heave in sight.
  Perhaps they were having trouble in a bad place.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was waning. The red sun hung low above the yellow mesa to
  the left, and there was a perceptible shading of light.</p>

  <p>At last Nas Ta Bega came to a place that halted him. It did not look so
  bad as places they had successfully passed. Yet upon closer study Shefford
  did not see how they were to get around the neck of the gully at their feet.
  Presently the Indian put the bridle over the head of his mustang and left him
  free. He did likewise for two more mustangs, while Lassiter and Shefford
  rendered a like service to theirs. Then the Indian started down, with his
  mustang following him. The pack-animal came next, then Fay and Nack-yal, then
  Lassiter and his mount, with Jane and hers next, and Shefford last. They
  followed the Indian, picking their steps swiftly, looking nowhere except at
  the stone under their feet. The right side of the chasm was rimmed, the curve
  at the head crossed, and then the real peril of this trap had to be faced. It
  was a narrow slant of ledge, doubling back parallel with the course already
  traversed.</p>

  <p>A sharp warning cry from Nas Ta Bega scarcely prepared Shefford for hoarse
  yells, and then a rattling rifle-volley from the top of the slope opposite.
  Bullets thudded on the cliff, whipped up red dust, and spanged and droned
  away.</p>

  <p>Fay Larkin screamed and staggered back against the wall. Nack-yal was hit,
  and with frightened snort he reared, pawed the air, and came down, pounding
  the stone. The mustang behind him went to his knees, sank with his head over
  the rim, and, slipping off, plunged into the depths. In an instant a dull
  crash came up.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was imminent peril for the horses, more in the yawning
  hole than in the spanging of badly aimed bullets. Lassiter drew Jane up a
  little slope out of the way of the frightened mustangs, and Shefford, risking
  his neck, rushed to Fay. She was holding her arm, which was bleeding.
  Unheeding the rain of bullets, he half carried, half dragged her along the
  slope of the low bluff, where he hid behind a corner till the Indian drove
  the mustangs round it. Shefford's swift fingers were wet and red with the
  blood from Fay's arm when he had bound the wound with his scarf. Lassiter had
  gotten around with Jane and was calling Shefford to hurry.</p>

  <p>It had been Shefford's idea to halt there and fight. But he did not want
  to send Fay on alone, so he hurried ahead with her. The Indian had the horses
  going fast on a long level, overhung by bulging wall. Lassiter and Jane were
  looking back. Shefford, becoming aware of a steep slope to his left, looked
  down to see a narrow chasm and great crevices in the cliffs, with bunches of
  cedars here and there.</p>

  <p>Presently Nas Ta Bega disappeared with the mustangs. He had evidently
  turned off to go down behind the split cliffs. Shefford and Fay caught up
  with Lassiter and Jane, and, panting, hurrying, looking backward and then
  forward, they kept on, as best they could, in the Indian's course. Shefford
  made sure they had lost him, when he appeared down to the left. Then they all
  ran to catch up with him. They went around the chasm, and then through one of
  the narrow cracks to come out upon the rim, among cedars. Here the Indian
  waited for them. He pointed down another long swell of naked stone to a
  narrow green split which was evidently different from all these curved pits
  and holes and abysses, for this one had straight walls and wound away out of
  sight. It was the head of a canyon.</p>

  <p>"Nonnezoshe Boco!" said the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, go on!" replied Shefford. "When Shadd comes out on that
  slope above he can't see you&mdash;where you go down. Hurry on with the
  horses and women. Lassiter, you go with them. And if Shadd passes me and
  comes up with you&mdash;do your best... I'm going to ambush that Piute and
  his gang!"</p>

  <p>"Shore you've picked out a good place," replied Lassiter.</p>

  <p>In another moment Shefford was alone. He heard the light, soft pat and
  slide of the hoofs of the mustangs as they went down. Presently that sound
  ceased.</p>

  <p>He looked at the red stain on his hands&mdash;from the blood of the girl
  he loved. And he had to stifle a terrible wrath that shook his frame. In
  regard to Shadd's pursuit, it had not been blood that he had feared, but
  capture for Fay. He and Nas Ta Bega might have expected a shot if they
  resisted, but to wound that unfortunate girl&mdash;it made a tiger out of
  him. When he had stilled the emotions that weakened and shook him and reached
  cold and implacable control of himself, he crawled under the cedars to the
  rim and, well hidden, he watched and waited.</p>

  <p>Shadd appeared to be slow for the first time since he had been sighted.
  With keen eyes Shefford watched the corner where he and the others had
  escaped from that murderous volley. But Shadd did not come.</p>

  <p>The sun had lost its warmth and was tipping the lofty mesa to his right.
  Soon twilight would make travel on those walls more perilous and darkness
  would make it impossible. Shadd must hurry or abandon the pursuit for that
  day. Shefford found himself grimly hopeful.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he heard the click of hoofs. It came, faint yet clear, on the
  still air. He glued his sight upon that corner where he expected the pursuers
  to appear. More cracks of hoofs pierced his ear, clearer and sharper this
  time. Presently he gathered that they could not possibly come from beyond the
  corner he was watching. So he looked far to the left of that place, seeing no
  one, then far to the right. Out over a bulge of stone he caught sight of the
  bobbing head of a horse&mdash;then another&mdash;and still another.</p>

  <p>He was astounded. Shadd had gone below that place where the attack had
  been made and he had come up this steep slope. More horses appeared&mdash; to
  the number of eight. Shefford easily recognized a low, broad, squat rider to
  be Shadd. Assuredly the Piute did not know this country. Possibly, however,
  he had feared an ambush. But Shefford grew convinced that Shadd had not
  expected an ambush, or at least did not fear it, and had mistaken the
  Indian's course. Moreover, if he led his gang a few rods farther up that
  slope he would do worse than make a mistake&mdash;he would be facing a double
  peril.</p>

  <p>What fearless horsemen these Indians were! Shadd was mounted, as were
  three others of his gang. Evidently the white men, the outlaws, were the ones
  on foot. Shefford thrilled and his veins stung when he saw these pursuers
  come passing what he considered the danger mark. But manifestly they could
  not see their danger. Assuredly they were aware of the chasm; however, the
  level upon which they were advancing narrowed gradually, and they could not
  tell that very soon they could not go any farther nor could they turn back.
  The alternative was to climb the slope, and that was a desperate chance.</p>

  <p>They came up, now about on a level with Shefford, and perhaps three
  hundred yards distant. He gripped his rifle with a fatal assurance that he
  could kill one of them now. Still he waited. Curiosity consumed him because
  every foot they advanced heightened their peril. Shefford wondered if Shadd
  would have chosen that course if he had not supposed the Navajo had chosen it
  first. It was plain that one of the walking Piutes stooped now and then to
  examine the rock. He was looking for some faint sign of a horse track.</p>

  <p>Shadd halted within two hundred yards of where Shefford lay hidden. His
  keen eye had caught the significance of the narrowing level before he had
  reached the end. He pointed and spoke. Shefford heard his voice. The others
  replied. They all looked up at the steep slope, down into the chasm right
  below them, and across into the cedars. The Piute in the rear succeeded in
  turning his horse, went back, and began to circle up the slope. The others
  entered into an argument and they became more closely grouped upon the narrow
  bench. Their mustangs were lean, wiry, wild, vicious, and Shefford calculated
  grimly upon what a stampede might mean in that position.</p>

  <p>Then Shadd turned his mustang up the slope. Like a goat he climbed.
  Another Indian in the rear succeeded in pivoting his steed and started back,
  apparently to circle round and up. The others of the gang appeared uncertain.
  They yelled hoarsely at Shadd, who halted on the steep slant some twenty
  paces above them. He spoke and made motions that evidently meant the climb
  was easy enough. It looked easy for him. His dark face flashed red in the
  rays of the sun.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment Shefford decided to fire. He meant to kill Shadd,
  hoping if the leader was gone the others would abandon the pursuit. The rifle
  wavered a little as he aimed, then grew still. He fired. Shadd never
  flinched. But the fiery mustang, perhaps wounded, certainly terrified,
  plunged down with piercing, horrid scream. Shadd fell under him. Shrill yells
  rent the air. Like a thunderbolt the sliding horse was upon men and animals
  below.</p>

  <p>A heavy shock, wild snorts, upflinging heads and hoofs, a terrible
  tramping, thudding, shrieking melee, then a brown, twisting, tangled mass
  shot down the slant over the rim!</p>

  <p>Shefford dazedly thought he saw men running. He did see plunging horses.
  One slipped, fell, rolled, and went into the chasm.</p>

  <p>Then up from the depths came a crash, a long, slipping roar. In another
  instant there was a lighter crash and a lighter sliding roar.</p>

  <p>Two horses, shaking, paralyzed with fear, were left upon the narrow level.
  Beyond them a couple of men were crawling along the stone. Up on the level
  stood the two Indians, holding down frightened horses, and staring at the
  fatal slope.</p>

  <p>And Shefford lay there under the cedar, in the ghastly grip of the moment,
  hardly comprehending that his ill-aimed shot had been a thunderbolt.</p>

  <p>He did not think of shooting at the Piutes; they, however, recovering from
  their shock, evidently feared the ambush, for they swiftly drew up the slope
  and passed out of sight. The frightened horses below whistled and tramped
  along the lower level, finally vanishing. There was nothing left on the bare
  wall to prove to Shefford that it had been the scene of swift and tragic
  death. He leaned from his covert and peered over the rim. Hundreds of feet
  below he saw dark growths of pinyons. There was no sign of a pile of horses
  and men, and then he realized that he could not tell the number that had
  perished. The swift finale had been as stunning to him as if lightning had
  struck near him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it flashed over him what state of suspense and torture Fay and
  Jane must be in at that very moment. And, leaping up, he ran out of the
  cedars to the slope behind and hurried down at risk of limb. The sun had set
  by this time. He hoped he could catch up with the party before dark. He went
  straight down, and the end of the slope was a smooth, low wall. The Indian
  must have descended with the horses at some other point. The canyon was about
  fifty yards wide and it headed under the great slope of Navajo Mountain.
  These smooth, rounded walls appeared to end at its low rim.</p>

  <p>Shefford slid down upon a grassy bank, and finding the tracks of the
  horses, he followed them. They led along the wall. As soon as he had assured
  himself that Nas Ta Bega had gone down the canyon he abandoned the tracks and
  pushed ahead swiftly. He heard the soft rush of running water. In the center
  of the canyon wound heavy lines of bright-green foliage, bordering a rocky
  brook. The air was close, warm, and sweet with perfume of flowers. The walls
  were low and shelving, and soon lost that rounded appearance peculiar to the
  wind-worn slopes above. Shefford came to where the horses had plowed down a
  gravelly bank into the clear, swift water of the brook. The little pools of
  water were still muddy. Shefford drank, finding the water cold and sweet,
  without the bitter bite of alkali. He crossed and pushed on, running on the
  grassy levels. Flowers were everywhere, but he did not notice them
  particularly. The canyon made many leisurely turns, and its size, if it
  enlarged at all, was not perceptible to him yet. The rims above him were
  perhaps fifty feet high. Cottonwood-trees began to appear along the brook,
  and blossoming buck-brush in the corners of wall.</p>

  <p>He had traveled perhaps a mile when Nas Ta Bega, appearing to come out of
  the thicket, confronted him.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" called Shefford. "Where're Fay&mdash;and the others?"</p>

  <p>The Indian made a gesture that signified the rest of the party were beyond
  a little way. Shefford took Nas Ta Bega's arm, and as they walked, and he
  panted for breath, he told what had happened back on the slopes.</p>

  <p>The Indian made one of his singular speaking sweeps of hand, and he
  scrutinized Shefford's face, but he received the news in silence. They turned
  a corner of wall, crossed a wide, shallow, boulder-strewn place in the brook,
  and mounted the bank to a thicket. Beyond this, from a clump of cottonwoods,
  Lassiter strode out with a gun in each hand. He had been hiding.</p>

  <p>"Shore I'm glad to see you," he said, and the eyes that piercingly fixed
  on Shefford were now as keen as formerly they had been mild.</p>

  <p>"Gone! Lassiter&mdash;they're gone," broke out Shefford. "Where's Fay
  &mdash;and Jane?"</p>

  <p>Lassiter called, and presently the women came out of the thick brake, and
  Fay bounded forward with her swift stride, while Jane followed with eager
  step and anxious face. Then they all surrounded Shefford.</p>

  <p>"It was Shadd&mdash;and his gang," panted Shefford. "Eight in all. Three
  or four Piutes&mdash;the others outlaws. They lost track of us. Went below
  the place&mdash;where they shot at us. And they came up&mdash;on a bad
  slope."</p>

  <p>Shefford described the slope and the deep chasm and how Shadd led up to
  the point where he saw his mistake and then how the catastrophe fell.</p>

  <p>"I shot&mdash;and missed," repeated Shefford, with the sweat in beads on
  his pale face. "I missed Shadd. Maybe I hit the horse. He plunged&mdash;
  reared&mdash;fell back&mdash;a terrible fall&mdash;right upon that bunch of
  horses and men below... In a horrible, wrestling, screaming tangle they slid
  over the rim! I don't know how many. I saw some men running along. I saw
  three other horses plunging. One slipped and went over... I have no idea how
  many, but Shadd and some of his gang went to destruction."</p>

  <p>"Shore thet's fine!" said Lassiter. "But mebbe I won't get to use them
  guns, after all."</p>

  <p>"Hardly on that gang," laughed Shefford. "The two Piutes and what others
  escaped turned back. Maybe they'll meet a posse of Mormons&mdash;for of
  course the Mormons will track us, too&mdash;and come back to where Shadd lost
  his life. That's an awful place. Even the Piute got lost&mdash; couldn't
  follow Nas Ta Bega. It would take any pursuers some time to find how we got
  in here. I believe we need not fear further pursuit. Certainly not to-night
  or to- morrow. Then we'll be far down the canyon."</p>

  <p>When Shefford concluded his earnest remarks the faces of Fay and Jane had
  lost the signs of suppressed dread.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, make camp here," said Shefford. "Water&mdash;wood&mdash;
  grass&mdash;why, this 's something like... Fay, how's your arm?"</p>

  <p>"It hurts," she replied, simply.</p>

  <p>"Come with me down to the brook and let me wash and bind it properly."</p>

  <p>They went, and she sat upon a stone while he knelt beside her and untied
  his scarf from her arm. As the blood had hardened, it was necessary to slit
  her sleeve to the shoulder. Using his scarf, he washed the blood from the
  wound, and found it to be merely a cut, a groove, on the surface.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing," Shefford said, lightly. "It'll heal in a day. But
  there'll always be a scar. And when we&mdash;we get back to civilization, and
  you wear a pretty gown without sleeves, people will wonder what made this
  mark on your beautiful arm."</p>

  <p>Fay looked at him with wonderful eyes. "Do women wear gowns without
  sleeves?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"They do."</p>

  <p>"Have I a&mdash;beautiful arm?"</p>

  <p>She stretched it out, white, blue-veined, the skin fine as satin, the
  lines graceful and flowing, a round, firm, strong arm.</p>

  <p>"The most beautiful I ever saw," he replied.</p>

  <p>But the pleasure his compliment gave her was not communicated to him. His
  last impression of that right arm had been of its strength, and his mind
  flashed with lightning swiftness to a picture that haunted him&mdash;
  Waggoner lying dead on the porch with that powerfully driven knife in his
  breast. Shefford shuddered through all his being. Would this phantom come
  often to him like that? Hurriedly he bound up her arm with the scarf and did
  not look at her, and was conscious that she felt a subtle change in him.</p>

  <p>The short twilight ended with the fugitives comfortable in a camp that for
  natural features could not have been improved upon. Darkness found Fay and
  Jane asleep on a soft mossy bed, a blanket tucked around them, and their
  faces still and beautiful in the flickering camp-fire light. Lassiter did not
  linger long awake. Nas Ta Bega, seeing Shefford's excessive fatigue, urged
  him to sleep. Shefford demurred, insisting that he share the night-watch. But
  Nas Ta Bega, by agreeing that Shefford might have the following night's duty,
  prevailed upon him.</p>

  <p>Shefford seemed to shut his eyes upon darkness and to open them
  immediately to the light. The stream of blue sky above, the gold tints on the
  western rim, the rosy, brightening colors down in the canyon, were proofs of
  the sunrise. This morning Nas Ta Bega proceeded leisurely, and his manner was
  comforting. When all was in readiness for a start he gave the mustang he had
  ridden to Shefford, and walked, leading the pack-animal.</p>

  <p>The mode of travel here was a selection of the best levels, the best
  places to cross the brook, the best banks to climb, and it was a process of
  continual repetition. As the Indian picked out the course and the mustangs
  followed his lead there was nothing for Shefford to do but take his choice
  between reflection that seemed predisposed toward gloom and an absorption in
  the beauty, color, wildness, and changing character of Nonnezoshe Boco.</p>

  <p>Assuredly his experience in the desert did not count in it a trip down
  into a strange, beautiful, lost canyon such as this. It did not widen, though
  the walls grew higher. They began to lean and bulge, and the narrow strip of
  sky above resembled a flowing blue river. Huge caverns had been hollowed out
  by some work of nature, what, he could not tell, though he was sure it could
  not have been wind. And when the brook ran close under one of these
  overhanging places the running water made a singular, indescribable sound. A
  crack from a hoof on a stone rang like a hollow bell and echoed from wall to
  wall. And the croak of a frog&mdash;the only living creature he had so far
  noted in the canyon&mdash;was a weird and melancholy thing.</p>

  <p>Fay rode close to him, and his heart seemed to rejoice when she spoke,
  when she showed how she wanted to be near him, yet, try as he might, he could
  not respond. His speech to her&mdash;what little there was&mdash;did not come
  spontaneously. And he suffered a remorse that he could not be honestly
  natural to her. Then he would drive away the encroaching gloom, trusting that
  a little time would dispel it.</p>

  <p>"We are deeper down than Surprise Valley," said Fay.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Here are the pink and yellow sago-lilies. You remember we went once to
  find the white ones? I have found white lilies in Surprise Valley, but never
  any pink or yellow."</p>

  <p>Shefford had seen flowers all along the green banks, but he had not marked
  the lilies. Here he dismounted and gathered several. They were larger than
  the white ones of higher altitudes, of the same exquisite beauty and
  fragility, of such rare pink and yellow hues as he had never seen. He gave
  the flowers to Fay.</p>

  <p>"They bloom only where it's always summer," she said.</p>

  <p>That expressed their nature. They were the orchids of the summer canyon.
  They stood up everywhere starlike out of the green. It was impossible to
  prevent the mustangs treading them under hoof. And as the canyon deepened,
  and many little springs added their tiny volume to the brook, every grassy
  bench was dotted with lilies, like a green sky star-spangled. And this
  increasing luxuriance manifested itself in the banks of purple moss and
  clumps of lavender daisies and great clusters of yellow violets. The brook
  was lined by blossoming buck-rush; the rocky corners showed the crimson and
  magenta of cactus; ledges were green with shining moss that sparkled with
  little white flowers. The hum of bees filled the air.</p>

  <p>But by and by this green and colorful and verdant beauty, the almost level
  floor of the canyon, the banks of soft earth, the thickets and the clumps of
  cotton-woods, the shelving caverns and the bulging walls&mdash;these features
  gradually were lost, and Nonnezoshe Boco began to deepen in bare red and
  white stone steps, the walls sheered away from one another, breaking into
  sections and ledges, and rising higher and higher, and there began to be
  manifested a dark and solemn concordance with the nature that had created
  this rent in the earth.</p>

  <p>There was a stretch of miles where steep steps in hard red rock alternated
  with long levels of round boulders. Here one by one the mustangs went lame.
  And the fugitives, dismounting to spare the faithful beasts, slipped and
  stumbled over these loose and treacherous stones. Fay was the only one who
  did not show distress. She was glad to be on foot again and the rolling
  boulders were as stable as solid rock for her.</p>

  <p>The hours passed; the toil increased; the progress diminished; one of the
  mustangs failed entirely and was left; and all the while the dimensions of
  Nonnezoshe Boco magnified and its character changed. It became a
  thousand-foot walled canyon, leaning, broken, threatening, with great yellow
  slides blocking passage, with huge sections split off from the main wall,
  with immense dark and gloomy caverns. Strangely, it had no intersecting
  canyon. It jealously guarded its secret. Its unusual formations of cavern and
  pillar and half-arch led the mind to expect any monstrous stone-shape left by
  an avalanche or cataclysm.</p>

  <p>Down and down the fugitives toiled. And now the stream-bed was bare of
  boulders, and the banks of earth. The floods that had rolled down that canyon
  had here borne away every loose thing. All the floor was bare red and white
  stone, polished, glistening, slippery, affording treacherous foothold. And
  the time came when Nas Ta Bega abandoned the stream-bed to take to the
  rock-strewn and cactus-covered ledges above.</p>

  <p>Jane gave out and had to be assisted upon the weary mustang. Fay was
  persuaded to mount Nack-yal again. Lassiter plodded along. The Indian bent
  tired steps far in front. And Shefford traveled on after him, footsore and
  hot.</p>

  <p>The canyon widened ahead into a great, ragged, iron-hued amphitheater, and
  from there apparently turned abruptly at right angles. Sunset rimmed the
  walls. Shefford wondered dully when the India would halt to camp. And he
  dragged himself onward with eyes down on the rough ground.</p>

  <p>When he raised them again the Indian stood on a point of slope with folded
  arms, gazing down where the canyon veered. Something in Nas Ta Bega's pose
  quickened Shefford's pulse and then his steps. He reached the Indian and the
  point where he, too, could see beyond that vast jutting wall that had
  obstructed his view.</p>

  <p>A mile beyond all was bright with the colors of sunset, and spanning the
  canyon in the graceful shape arid beautiful hues of a rainbow was a
  magnificent stone bridge.</p>

  <p>"Nonnezoshe!" exclaimed the Navajo, with a deep and sonorous roll in his
  voice.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII.</a> &mdash; AT THE FOOT OF THE RAINBOW</h2>

  <p class="first">THE rainbow bridge was the one great natural phenomenon, the
  one grand spectacle, which Shefford had ever seen that did not at first give
  vague disappointment, a confounding of reality, a disenchantment of contrast
  with what the mind had conceived.</p>

  <p>But this thing was glorious. It silenced him, yet did not awe or stun. His
  body and brain, weary and dull from the toil of travel, received a singular
  and revivifying freshness. He had a strange, mystic perception of this rosy-
  hued stupendous arch of stone, as if in a former life it had been a goal he
  could not reach. This wonder of nature, though all-satisfying, all-fulfilling
  to his artist's soul, could not be a resting-place for him, a destination
  where something awaited him, a height he must scale to find peace, the end of
  his strife. But it seemed all these. He could not understand his perception
  or his emotion. Still, here at last, apparently, was the rainbow of his
  boyish dreams and of his manhood&mdash;a rainbow magnified even beyond those
  dreams, no longer transparent and ethereal, but solidified, a thing of ages,
  sweeping up majestically from the red walls, its iris-hued arch against the
  blue sky.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega led on down the ledge and Shefford plodded thoughtfully after
  him. The others followed. A jutting corner of wall again hid the canyon. The
  Indian was working round to circle the huge amphitheater. It was slow,
  irritating, strenuous toil, for the way was on a steep slant, rough and loose
  and dragging. The rocks were as hard and jagged as lava. And the cactus
  further hindered progress. When at last the long half-circle had been
  accomplished the golden and rosy lights had faded.</p>

  <p>Again the canyon opened to view. All the walls were pale and steely and
  the stone bridge loomed dark. Nas Ta Bega said camp would be made at the
  bridge, which was now close. Just before they reached it the Navajo halted
  with one of his singular actions. Then he stood motionless. Shefford realized
  that Nas Ta Bega was saying his prayer to this great stone god. Presently the
  Indian motioned for Shefford to lead the others and the horses on under the
  bridge. Shefford did so, and, upon turning, was amazed to see the Indian
  climbing the steep and difficult slope on the other side. All the party
  watched him until he disappeared behind the huge base of cliff that supported
  the arch. Shefford selected a level place for camp, some few rods away, and
  here, with Lassiter, unsaddled and unpacked the lame, drooping mustangs. When
  this was done twilight had fallen. Nas Ta Bega appeared, coming down the
  steep slope on this side of the bridge. Then Shefford divined why the Navajo
  had made that arduous climb. He would not go under the bridge. Nonnezoshe was
  a Navajo god. And Nas Ta Bega, though educated as a white man, was true to
  the superstition of his ancestors.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega turned the mustangs loose to fare for what scant grass grew on
  bench and slope. Firewood was even harder to find than grass. When the camp
  duties had been performed and the simple meal eaten there was gloom gathering
  in the canyon and the stars had begun to blink in the pale strip of blue
  above the lofty walls. The place was oppressive and the fugitives mostly
  silent. Shefford spread a bed of blankets for the women, and Jane at once lay
  wearily down. Fay stood beside the flickering fire, and Shefford felt her
  watching him. He was conscious of a desire to get away from her haunting
  gaze. To the gentle good-night he bade her she made no response.</p>

  <p>Shefford moved away into a strange dark shadow cast by the bridge against
  the pale starlight. It was a weird, black belt, where he imagined he was
  invisible, but out of which he could see. There was a slab of rock near the
  foot of the bridge, and here Shefford composed himself to watch, to feel, to
  think the unknown thing that seemed to be inevitably coming to him.</p>

  <p>A slight stiffening of his neck made him aware that he had been
  continually looking up at the looming arch. And he found that insensibly it
  had changed and grown. It had never seemed the same any two moments, but that
  was not what he meant. Near at hand it was too vast a thing for immediate
  comprehension. He wanted to ponder on what had formed it&mdash;to reflect
  upon its meaning as to age and force of nature, yet all he could do at each
  moment was to see. White stars hung along the dark curved line. The rim of
  the arch seemed to shine. The moon must be up there somewhere. The far side
  of the canyon was now a blank, black wall. Over its towering rim showed a
  pale glow. It brightened. The shades in the canyon lightened, then a white
  disk of moon peered over the dark line. The bridge turned to silver, and the
  gloomy, shadowy belt it had cast blanched and vanished.</p>

  <p>Shefford became aware of the presence of Nas Ta Bega. Dark, silent,
  statuesque, with inscrutable eyes uplifted, with all that was spiritual of
  the Indian suggested by a somber and tranquil knowledge of his place there,
  he represented the same to Shefford as a solitary figure of human life
  brought out the greatness of a great picture. Nonnezoshe Boco needed life,
  wild life, life of its millions of years&mdash;and here stood the dark and
  silent Indian.</p>

  <p>There was a surge in Shefford's heart and in his mind a perception of a
  moment of incalculable change to his soul. And at that moment Fay Larkin
  stole like a phantom to his side and stood there with her uncovered head
  shining and her white face lovely in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"May I stay with you&mdash;a little?" she asked, wistfully. "I can't
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"Surely you may," he replied. "Does your arm hurt too badly, or are you
  too tired to sleep?""</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's this place. I&mdash;I&mdash;can't tell you how I feel."</p>

  <p>But the feeling was there in her eyes for Shefford to read. Had he too
  great an emotion&mdash;did he read too much&mdash;did he add from his soul?
  For him the wild, starry, haunted eyes mirrored all that he had seen and felt
  under Nonnezoshe. And for herself they shone eloquently of courage and
  love.</p>

  <p>"I need to talk&mdash;and I don't know how," she said.</p>

  <p>He was silent, but he took her hands and drew her closer.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so&mdash;so different?" she asked, bravely.</p>

  <p>"Different?" he echoed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You are kind&mdash;you speak the same to me as you used to. But
  since we started you've been different, somehow."</p>

  <p>"Fay, think how hard and dangerous the trip's been! I've been worried
  &mdash;and sick with dread&mdash;with&mdash;Oh, you can't imagine the strain
  I'm under! How could I be my old self?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't worry I mean."</p>

  <p>He was too miserable to try to find out what she did mean; besides, he
  believed, if he let himself think about it, he would know what troubled
  her.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I am almost happy," she said, softly.</p>

  <p>"Fay!... Aren't you at all afraid?"</p>

  <p>"No. You'll take care of me... Do&mdash;do you love me&mdash;like you did
  before?"</p>

  <p>"Why, child! Of course&mdash;I love you," he replied, brokenly, and he
  drew her closer. He had never embraced her, never kissed her. But there was a
  whiteness about her then&mdash;a wraith&mdash;a something from her soul, and
  he could only gaze at her.</p>

  <p>"I love you," she whispered. "I thought I knew it that&mdash;that night.
  But I'm only finding it out now... And somehow I had to tell you here."</p>

  <p>"Fay, I haven't said much to you," he said, hurriedly, huskily. "I haven't
  had a chance. I love you. I&mdash;I ask you&mdash;will you be my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, simply, but the white, moon-blanched face colored
  with a dark and leaping blush.</p>

  <p>"We'll be married as soon as we get out of the desert," he went on. "And
  we'll forget&mdash;all&mdash;all that's happened. You're so young. You'll
  forget."</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten already, till this difference came in you. And pretty soon
  &mdash;when I can say something more to you&mdash;I'll forget all except
  Surprise Valley&mdash;and my evenings in the starlight with you."</p>

  <p>"Say it then&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>She was leaning against him, holding his hands in her strong clasp,
  soulful, tender, almost passionate.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't help it... I'm to blame... I remember what I said."</p>

  <p>"What?" he queried in amaze.</p>

  <p>"'YOU CAN KILL HIM!'... I said that. I made you kill him."</p>

  <p>"Kill&mdash;whom?" cried Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Waggoner. I'm to blame... That must be what's made you different. And,
  oh, I've wanted you to know it's all my fault... But I wouldn't be sorry if
  you weren't... I'm glad he's dead."</p>

  <p>"YOU&mdash;THINK&mdash;I&mdash;" Shefford's gasping whisper failed in the
  shock of the revelation that Fay believed he had killed Waggoner. Then with
  the inference came the staggering truth&mdash;her guiltlessness; and a
  paralyzing joy held him stricken.</p>

  <p>A powerful hand fell upon Shefford's shoulder, startling him. Nas Ta Bega
  stood there, looking down upon him and Fay. Never had the Indian seemed so
  dark, inscrutable of face. But in his magnificent bearing, in the spirit that
  Shefford sensed in him, there were nobility and power and a strange
  pride.</p>

  <p>The Indian kept one hand on Shefford's shoulder, and with the other he
  struck himself on the breast. The action was that of an Indian, impressive
  and stern, significant of an Indian's prowess.</p>

  <p>"My God!" breathed Shefford, very low.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what does he mean?" cried Fay.</p>

  <p>Shefford held her with shaking hands, trying to speak, to fight a way out
  of these stultifying emotions.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega&mdash;you heard. She thinks&mdash;I killed Waggoner!"</p>

  <p>All about the Navajo then was dark and solemn disproof of her belief. He
  did not need to speak. His repetition of that savage, almost boastful blow on
  his breast added only to the dignity, and not to the denial, of a
  warrior.</p>

  <p>"Fay, he means he killed the Mormon," said Shefford. "He must have, for
  <i>I</i> did not!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" murmured Fay, and she leaned to him with passionate, quivering
  gladness. It was the woman&mdash;the human&mdash;the soul born in her that
  came uppermost then; now, when there was no direct call to the wild and
  elemental in her nature, she showed a heart above revenge, the instinct of a
  saving right, of truth as Shefford knew them. He took her into his arms and
  never had he loved her so well.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, you killed the Mormon," declared Shefford, with a voice that
  had gained strength. No silent Indian suggestion of a deed would suffice in
  that moment. Shefford needed to hear the Navajo speak&mdash;to have Fay hear
  him speak. "Nas Ta Bega, I know I understand. But tell her. Speak so she will
  know. Tell it as a white man would!"</p>

  <p>"I heard her cry out," replied the Indian, in his slow English. "I waited.
  When he came I killed him."</p>

  <p>A poignant why was wrenched from Shefford. Nas Ta Bega stood silent.</p>

  <p>"BI NAI!" And when that sonorous Indian name rolled in dignity from his
  lips he silently stalked away into the gloom. That was his answer to the
  white man.</p>

  <p>Shefford bent over Fay, and as the strain on him broke he held her closer
  and closer and his tears streamed down and his voice broke in exclamations of
  tenderness and thanksgiving. It did not matter what she had thought, but she
  must never know what he had thought. He clasped her as something precious he
  had lost and regained. He was shaken with a passion of remorse. How could he
  have believed Fay Larkin guilty of murder? Women less wild and less justified
  than she had been driven to such a deed, yet how could he have believed it of
  her, when for two days he had been with her, had seen her face, and deep into
  her eyes? There was mystery in his very blindness. He cast the whole thought
  from him for ever. There was no shadow between Fay and him. He had found her.
  He had saved her. She was free. She was innocent. And suddenly, as he seemed
  delivered from contending tumults within, he became aware that it was no
  unresponsive creature he had folded to his breast.</p>

  <p>He became suddenly alive to the warm, throbbing contact of her bosom, to
  her strong arms clinging round his neck, to her closed eyes, to the rapt
  whiteness of her face. And he bent to cold lips that seemed to receive his
  first kisses as new and strange; but tremulously changed, at last to meet his
  own, and then to burn with sweet and thrilling fire.</p>

  <p>"My darling, my dream's come true," he said. "You are my treasure. I found
  you here at the foot of the rainbow!... What if it is a stone rainbow
  &mdash;if all is not as I had dreamed? I followed a gleam. And it's led me to
  love and faith!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">HOURS afterward Shefford walked alone to and fro under the
  bridge. His trouble had given place to serenity. But this night of nights he
  must live out wide-eyed to its end.</p>

  <p>The moon had long since crossed the streak of star-fired blue above and
  the canyon was black in shadow. At times a current of wind, with all the
  strangeness of that strange country in its hollow moan, rushed through the
  great stone arch. At other times there was silence such as Shefford imagined
  dwelt deep under this rocky world. At still other times an owl hooted, and
  the sound was nameless. But it had a mocking echo that never ended. An echo
  of night, silence, gloom, melancholy death, age, eternity!</p>

  <p>The Indian lay asleep with his dark face upturned, and the other sleepers
  lay calm and white in the starlight.</p>

  <p>Shefford saw in them the meaning of life and the past&mdash;the
  illimitable train of faces that had shone the stars. There was a spirit in
  the canyon, and whether or not it was what the Navajo embodied in the great
  Nonnezoshe, or the life of this present, or the death of the ages, or the
  nature so magnificently manifested in those silent, dreaming waiting walls
  &mdash;the truth for Shefford was that this spirit was God.</p>

  <p>Life was eternal. Man's immortality lay in himself. Love of a woman was
  hope&mdash;happiness. Brotherhood&mdash;that mystic and grand "Bi Nai!" of
  the Navajo&mdash;that was religion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX.</a> &mdash; THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO</h2>

  <p class="first">THE night passed, the gloom turned gray, the dawn stole cool
  and pale into the canyon. When Nas Ta Bega drove the mustangs into camp the
  lofty ramparts of the walls were rimmed with gold and the dark arch of
  Nonnezoshe began to lose its steely gray.</p>

  <p>The women had rested well and were in better condition to travel. Jane was
  cheerful and Fay radiant one moment and in a dream the next. She was
  beginning to live in that wonderful future. They talked more than usual at
  breakfast, and Lassiter made droll remarks. Shefford, with his great and
  haunting trouble ended for ever, with now only danger to face ahead, was a
  different man, but thoughtful and quiet.</p>

  <p>This morning the Indian leisurely made preparations for the start. For all
  the concern he showed he might have known every foot of the canyon below
  Nonnezoshe. But, for Shefford, with the dawn had returned anxiety, a restless
  feeling of the need of hurry. What obstacles, what impassable gorges, might
  lie between this bridge and the river! The Indian's inscrutable serenity and
  Fay's trust, her radiance, the exquisite glow upon her face, sustained
  Shefford and gave him patience to endure and conceal his dread.</p>

  <p>At length the flight was resumed, with Nas Ta Bega leading on foot, and
  Shefford walking in the rear. A quarter of a mile below camp the Indian led
  down a declivity into the bottom of the narrow gorge, where the stream ran.
  He did not gaze backward for a last glance at Nonnezoshe; nor did Jane or
  Lassiter. Fay, however, checked Nack-yal at the rim of the descent and turned
  to look behind. Shefford contrasted her tremulous smile, her half-happy
  good-by to this place, with the white stillness of her face when she had bade
  farewell to Surprise Valley. Then she rode Nack-yal down into the gorge.</p>

  <p>Shefford knew that this would be his last look at the rainbow bridge. As
  he gazed the tip of the great arch lost its cold, dark stone color and began
  to shine. The sun had just arisen high enough over some low break in the wall
  to reach the bridge. Shefford watched. Slowly, in wondrous transformation,
  the gold and blue and rose and pink and purple blended their hues, softly,
  mistily, cloudily, until once again the arch was a rainbow.</p>

  <p>Ages before life had evolved upon the earth it had spread its grand arch
  from wall to wall, black and mystic at night, transparent and rosy in the
  sunrise, at sunset a flaming curve limned against the heavens. When the race
  of man had passed it would, perhaps, stand there still. It was not for many
  eyes to see. Only by toil, sweat, endurance, blood, could any man ever look
  at Nonnezoshe. So it would always be alone, grand, silent, beautiful,
  unintelligible.</p>

  <p>Shefford bade Nonnezoshe a mute, reverent farewell. Then plunging down the
  weathered slope of the gorge to the stream below, he hurried forward to join
  the others. They had progressed much farther than he imagined they would
  have, and this was owing to the fact that the floor of the gorge afforded
  easy travel. It was gravel on rock bottom, tortuous, but open, with
  infrequent and shallow downward steps. The stream did not now rush and boil
  along and tumble over rock-encumbered ledges. In corners the water collected
  in round, green, eddying pools. There were patches of grass and willows and
  mounds of moss. Shefford's surprise equaled his relief, for he believed that
  the violent descent of Nonnezoshe Boco had been passed. Any turn now, he
  imagined, might bring the party out upon the river. When he caught up with
  them he imparted this conviction, which was received with cheer. The hopes of
  all, except the Indian, seemed mounting; and if he ever hoped or despaired it
  was never manifest.</p>

  <p>Shefford's anticipation, however, was not soon realized. The fugitives
  traveled miles farther down Nonnezoshe Boco, and the only changes were that
  the walls of the lower gorge heightened and merged into those above and that
  these upper ones towered ever loftier. Shefford had to throw his head
  straight back to look up at the rims, and the narrow strip of sky was now
  indeed a flowing stream of blue.</p>

  <p>Difficult steps were met, too, yet nothing compared to those of the upper
  canyon. Shefford calculated that this day's travel had advanced several
  hours; and more than ever now he was anticipating the mouth of Nonnezoshe
  Boco. Still another hour went by. And then came striking changes. The canyon
  narrowed till the walls were scarcely twenty paces apart; the color of stone
  grew dark red above and black down low; the light of day became shadowed, and
  the floor was a level, gravelly, winding lane, with the stream meandering
  slowly and silently.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Indian halted. He turned his ear down the canyon lane. He had
  heard something. The others grouped round him, but did not hear a sound
  except the soft flow of water and the heave of the mustangs. Then the Indian
  went on. Presently he halted again. And again he listened. This time he threw
  up his head and upon his dark face shone a light which might have been
  pride.</p>

  <p>"Tse ko-n-tsa-igi," he said.</p>

  <p>The others could not understand, but they were impressed.</p>

  <p>"Shore he means somethin' big," drawled Lassiter.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what did he say?" queried Fay in eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Nas Ta Bega, tell us," said Shefford. "We are full of hope."</p>

  <p>"Grand Canyon," replied the Indian.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked Shefford.</p>

  <p>"I hear the roar of the river."</p>

  <p>But Shefford, listen as he might, could not hear it. They traveled on,
  winding down the wonderful lane. Every once in a while Shefford lagged
  behind, let the others pass out of hearing, and then he listened. At last he
  was rewarded. Low and deep, dull and strange, with some quality to incite
  dread, came a roar. Thereafter, at intervals, usually at turns in the canyon,
  and when a faint stir of warm air fanned his cheeks, he heard the sound,
  growing clearer and louder.</p>

  <p>He rounded an abrupt corner to have the roar suddenly fill his ears, to
  see the lane extend straight to a ragged vent, and beyond that, at some
  distance, a dark, ragged, bulging wall, like iron. As he hurried forward he
  was surprised to find that the noise did not increase. Here it kept a strange
  uniformity of tone and volume. The others of the party passed out of the
  mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco in advance of Shefford, and when he reached it they
  were grouped upon a bank of sand. A dark-red canyon yawned before them, and
  through it slid the strangest river Shefford had ever seen. At first glance
  he imagined the strangeness consisted of the dark-red color of the water, but
  at the second he was not so sure. All the others, except Nas Ta Bega, eyed
  the river blankly, as if they did not know what to think. The roar came from
  round a huge bulging wall downstream. Up the canyon, half a mile, at another
  turn, there was a leaping rapid of dirty red-white waves and the sound of
  this, probably, was drowned in the unseen but nearer rapid.</p>

  <p>"This is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado," said Shefford. "We've come out
  at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco... And now to wait for Joe Lake!"</p>

  <p>They made camp on a dry, level sand-bar under a shelving wall. Nas Ta Bega
  collected a pile of driftwood to be used for fire, and then he took the
  mustangs back up the side canyon to find grass for them. Lassiter appeared
  unusually quiet, and soon passed from weary rest on the sand to deep slumber.
  Fay and Jane succumbed to an exhaustion that manifested itself the moment
  relaxation set in, and they, too, fell asleep. Shefford patrolled the long
  strip of sand under the wall, and watched up the river for Joe Lake. The
  Indian returned and went along the river, climbed over the jutting, sharp
  slopes that reached into the water, and passed out of sight up-stream toward
  the rapid.</p>

  <p>Shefford had a sense that the river and the canyon were too magnificent to
  be compared with others. Still, all his emotions and sensations had been so
  wrought upon, he seemed not to have any left by which he might judge of what
  constituted the difference. He would wait. He had a grim conviction that
  before he was safely out of this earth-riven crack he would know. One thing,
  however, struck him, and it was that up the canyon, high over the lower
  walls, hazy and blue, stood other walls, and beyond and above them, dim in
  purple distance, upreared still other walls. The haze and the blue and the
  purple meant great distance, and, likewise, the height seemed
  incomparable.</p>

  <p>The red river attracted him most. Since this was the medium by which he
  must escape with his party, it was natural that it absorbed him, to the
  neglect of the gigantic cliffs. And the more he watched the river, studied
  it, listened to it, imagined its nature, its power, its restlessness, the
  more he dreaded it. As the hours of the afternoon wore away, and he strolled
  along and rested on the banks, his first impressions, and what he realized
  might be his truest ones, were gradually lost. He could not bring them back.
  The river was changing, deceitful. It worked upon his mind. The low, hollow
  roar filled his ears and seemed to mock him. Then he endeavored to stop
  thinking about it, to confine his attention to the gap up-stream where sooner
  or later he prayed that Joe Lake and his boat would appear. But, though he
  controlled his gaze, he could not his thought, and his strange, impondering
  dread of the river augmented.</p>

  <p>The afternoon waned. Nas Ta Bega came back to camp and said any likelihood
  of Joe's arrival was past for that day. Shefford could not get over an
  impression of strangeness&mdash;of the impossibility of the reality presented
  to his naked eyes. These lonely fugitives in the huge-walled canyon waiting
  for a boatman to come down that river! Strange and wild&mdash;those were the
  words which, inadequately at best, suited this country and the situations it
  produced.</p>

  <p>After supper he and Fay walked along the bars of smooth, red sand. There
  were a few moments when the distant peaks and domes and turrets were
  glorified in changing sunset hues. But the beauty was fleeting. Fay still
  showed lassitude. She was quiet, yet cheerful, and the sweetness of her
  smile, her absolute trust in him, stirred and strengthened anew his spirit.
  Yet he suffered torture when he thought of trusting Fay's life, her soul, and
  her beauty to this strange red river.</p>

  <p>Night brought him relief. He could not see the river; only the low roar
  made its presence known out there in the shadows. And, there being no need to
  stay awake, he dropped at once into heavy slumber. He was roused by hands
  dragging at him. Nas Ta Bega bent over him. It was broad daylight. The yellow
  wall high above was glistening. A fire was crackling and pleasant odors were
  wafted to him. Fay and Jane and Lassiter sat around the tarpaulin at
  breakfast. After the meal suspense and strain were manifested in all the
  fugitives, even the imperturbable Indian being more than usually watchful.
  His eyes scarcely ever left the black gap where the river slid round the turn
  above. Soon, as on the preceding day, he disappeared up the ragged,
  iron-bound shore. There was scarcely an attempt at conversation. A
  controlling thought bound that group into silence&mdash;if Joe Lake was ever
  going to come he would come to- day.</p>

  <p>Shefford asked himself a hundred times if it were possible, and his answer
  seemed to be in the low, sullen, muffled roar of the river. And as the
  morning wore on toward noon his dread deepened until all chance appeared
  hopeless. Already he had begun to have vague and unformed and disquieting
  ideas of the only avenue of escape left&mdash;to return up Nonnezoshe Boco
  &mdash;and that would be to enter a trap.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a piercing cry pealed down the canyon. It was followed by echoes,
  weird and strange, that clapped from wall to wall in mocking concatenation.
  Nas Ta Bega appeared high on the ragged slope. The cry had been the Indian's.
  He swept an arm out, pointing up-stream, and stood like a statue on the iron
  rocks.</p>

  <p>Shefford's keen gaze sighted a moving something in the bend of the river.
  It was long, low, dark, and flat, with a lighter object upright in the
  middle. A boat and a man!</p>

  <p>"Joe! It's Joe!" yelled Shefford, madly. "There!... Look!"</p>

  <p>Jane and Fay were on their knees in the sand, clasping each other, pale
  faces toward that bend in the river.</p>

  <p>Shefford ran up the shore toward the Indian. He climbed the jutting slant
  of rock. The boat was now full in the turn&mdash;it moved faster&mdash;it was
  nearing the smooth incline above the rapid. There! it glided down&mdash;
  heaved darkly up&mdash;settled back&mdash;and disappeared in the frothy,
  muddy roughness of water. Shefford held his breath and watched. A dark,
  bobbing object showed, vanished, showed again to enlarge&mdash;to take the
  shape of a big flatboat&mdash;and then it rode the swift, choppy current out
  of the lower end of the rapid.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega began to make violent motions, and Shefford, taking his cue,
  frantically waved his red scarf. There was a five-mile-an-hour current right
  before them, and Joe must needs see them so that he might sheer the huge and
  clumsy craft into the shore before it drifted too far down.</p>

  <p>Presently Joe did see them. He appeared to be half-naked; he raised aloft
  both arms, and bellowed down the canyon. The echoes boomed from wall to wall,
  every one stronger with the deep, hoarse triumph in the Mormon's voice, till
  they passed on, growing weaker, to die away in the roar of the river below.
  Then Joe bent to a long oar that appeared to be fastened to the stern of the
  boat, and the craft drifted out of the swifter current toward the shore. It
  reached a point opposite to where Shefford and the Indian waited, and, though
  Joe made prodigious efforts, it slid on. Still, it also drifted shoreward,
  and half-way down to the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco Joe threw the end of a rope
  to the Indian.</p>

  <p>"Ho! Ho!" yelled the Mormon, again setting into motion the fiendish
  echoes. He was naked to the waist; he had lost flesh; he was haggard, worn,
  dirty, wet. While he pulled on a shirt Nas Ta Bega made the rope fast to a
  snag of a log of driftwood embedded in the sand, and the boat swung to shore.
  It was perhaps thirty feet long by half as many wide, crudely built of
  rough-hewn boards. The steering-gear was a long pole with a plank nailed to
  the end. The craft was empty save for another pole and plank, Joe's coat, and
  a broken- handled shovel. There were water and sand on the flooring. Joe
  stepped ashore and he was gripped first by Shefford and then by the Indian.
  He was an unkempt and gaunt giant, yet how steadfast and reliable, how grimly
  strong to inspire hope!</p>

  <p>"Reckon most of me's here," he said in reply to greetings. "I've had water
  aplenty. My God! I've had WATER!" He rolled out a grim laugh. "But no grub
  for three days... Forgot to fetch some!"</p>

  <p>How practical he was! He told Fay she looked good for sore eyes, but he
  needed a biscuit most of all. There was just a second of singular hesitation
  when he faced Lassiter, and then the big, strong hand of the young Mormon
  went out to meet the old gunman's. While they fed him and he ate like a
  starved man Shefford told of the flight from the village, the rescuing of
  Jane and Lassiter from Surprise Valley, the descent from the plateau, the
  catastrophe to Shadd's gang&mdash;and, concluding, Shefford, without any
  explanation, told that Nas Ta Bega had killed the Mormon Waggoner.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I had that figured," replied Joe. "First off. I didn't think so
  ... So Shadd went over the cliff. That's good riddance. It beats me, though.
  Never knew that Piute's like with a horse. And he had some grand horses in
  his outfit. Pity about them."</p>

  <p>Later when Joe had a moment alone with Shefford he explained that during
  his ride to Kayenta he had realized Fay's innocence and who had been
  responsible for the tragedy. He took Withers, the trader, into his
  confidence, and they planned a story, which Withers was to carry to
  Stonebridge, that would exculpate Fay and Shefford of anything more serious
  than flight. If Shefford got Fay safely out of the country at once that would
  end the matter for all concerned.</p>

  <p>"Reckon I'm some ferry-boatman, too&mdash;a FAIRY boatman. Haw! Haw!" he
  added. "And we're going through... Now I want you to help me rig this
  tarpaulin up over the bow of the boat. If we can fix it up strong it'll keep
  the waves from curling over. They filled her four times for me."</p>

  <p>They folded the tarpaulin three times, and with stout pieces of split
  plank and horseshoe nails from Shefford's saddle-bags and pieces of rope they
  rigged up a screen around bow and front corners.</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega put the saddles in the boat. The mustangs were far up
  Nonnezoshe Boco and would work their way back to green and luxuriant canyons.
  The Indian said they would soon become wild and would never be found.
  Shefford regretted Nack-yal, but was glad the faithful little mustang would
  be free in one of those beautiful canyons.</p>

  <p>"Reckon we'd better be off," called Joe. "All aboard!" He placed Fay and
  Jane in a corner of the bow, where they would be spared sight of the rapids.
  Shefford loosed the rope and sprang aboard. "Pard," said Joe, "it's one hell
  of a river! And now with the snow melting up in the mountains it's twenty
  feet above normal and rising fast. But that's well for us. It covers the
  stones in the rapids. If it hadn't been in flood Joe would be an angel
  now!"</p>

  <p>The boat cleared the sand, lazily wheeled in the eddying water, and
  suddenly seemed caught by some powerful gliding force. When it swept out
  beyond the jutting wall Shefford saw a quarter of a mile of sliding water
  that appeared to end abruptly. Beyond lengthened out the gigantic gap between
  the black and frowning cliffs.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" ejaculated Joe. "Drops out of sight there. But that one ain't much.
  I can tell by the roar. When you see my hair stand up straight&mdash;then
  watch out!... Lassiter, you look after the women. Shefford, you stand ready
  to bail out with the shovel, for we'll sure ship water. Nas Ta Bega, you help
  here with the oar."</p>

  <p>The roar became a heavy, continuous rumble; the current quickened; little
  streaks and ridges seemed to race along the boat; strange gurglings rose from
  under the bow. Shefford stood on tiptoe to see the break in the river below.
  Swiftly it came into sight&mdash;a wonderful, long, smooth, red slant of
  water, a swelling mound, a huge back-curling wave, another and another, a sea
  of frothy, uplifting crests, leaping and tumbling and diminishing down to the
  narrowing apex of the rapid. It was a frightful sight, yet it thrilled
  Shefford. Joe worked the steering-oar back and forth and headed the boat
  straight for the middle of the incline. The boat reached the round rim,
  gracefully dipped with a heavy sop, and went shooting down. The wind blew wet
  in Shefford's face. He stood erect, thrilling, fascinated, frightened. Then
  he seemed to feel himself lifted; the curling wave leaped at the boat; there
  was a shock that laid him flat; and when he rose to his knees all about him
  was roar and spray and leaping, muddy waves. Shock after shock jarred the
  boat. Splashes of water stung his face. And then the jar and the motion, the
  confusion and roar, gradually lessened until presently Shefford rose to see
  smooth water ahead and the long, trembling rapid behind.</p>

  <p>"Get busy, bailer," yelled Joe. "Pretty soon you'll be glad you have to
  bail&mdash;so you can't see!"</p>

  <p>There were several inches of water in the bottom of the boat and Shefford
  learned for the first time the expediency of a shovel in the art of
  bailing.</p>

  <p>"That tarpaulin worked powerful good," went on Joe. "And it saves the
  women. Now if it just don't bust on a big wave! That one back there was
  little."</p>

  <p>When Shefford had scooped out all the water he went forward to see how Fay
  and Jane and Lassiter had fared. The women were pale, but composed. They had
  covered their heads.</p>

  <p>"But the dreadful roar!" exclaimed Fay.</p>

  <p>Lassiter looked shaken for once.</p>

  <p>"Shore I'd rather taken a chance meetin' them Mormons on the way out," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Shefford spoke with an encouraging assurance which he did not himself
  feel. Almost at the moment he marked a silence that had fallen into the
  canyon; then it broke to a low, dull, strange roar.</p>

  <p>"Aha! Hear that?" The Mormon shook his shaggy head. "Reckon we're in
  Cataract Canyon. We'll be standing on end from now on. Hang on to her,
  boys!"</p>

  <p>Danger of this unusual kind had brought out a peculiar levity in the
  somber Mormon&mdash;a kind of wild, gay excitement. His eyes rolled as he
  watched the river ahead and he puffed out his cheek with his tongue.</p>

  <p>The rugged, overhanging walls of the canyon grew sinister in Shefford's
  sight. They were jaws. And the river&mdash;that made him shudder to look down
  into it. The little whirling pits were eyes peering into his, and they raced
  on with the boat, disappeared, and came again, always with the little, hollow
  gurgles.</p>

  <p>The craft drifted swiftly and the roar increased. Another rapid seemed to
  move up into view. It came at a bend in the canyon. When the breeze struck
  Shefford's cheeks he did not this time experience exhilaration. The current
  accelerated its sliding motion and bore the flatboat straight for the middle
  of the curve. Shefford saw the bend, a long, dark, narrow, gloomy canyon, and
  a stretch of contending waters, then, crouching low, he waited for the dip,
  the race, the shock. They came&mdash;the last stopping the boat&mdash;
  throwing it aloft&mdash;letting it drop&mdash;and crests of angry waves
  curled over the side. Shefford, kneeling, felt the water slap around him, and
  in his ears was a deafening roar. There were endless moments of strife and
  hell and flying darkness of spray all about him, and under him the rocking
  boat. When they lessened&mdash;ceased in violence&mdash;he stood ankle-deep
  in water, and then madly he began to bail.</p>

  <p>Another roar deadened his ears, but he did not look up from his toil. And
  when he had to get down to avoid the pitch he closed his eyes. That rapid
  passed and with more water to bail, he resumed his share in the manning of
  the crude craft. It was more than a share&mdash;a tremendous responsibility
  to which he bent with all his might. He heard Joe yell&mdash;and again
  &mdash;and again. He heard the increasing roars one after another till they
  seemed one continuous bellow. He felt the shock, the pitch, the beating
  waves, and then the lessening power of sound and current. That set him to his
  task. Always in these long intervals of toil he seemed to see, without
  looking up, the growing proportions of the canyon. And the river had become a
  living, terrible thing. The intervals of his tireless effort when he scooped
  the water overboard were fleeting, and the rides through rapid after rapid
  were endless periods of waiting terror. His spirit and his hope were
  overwhelmed by the rush and roar and fury.</p>

  <p>Then, as he worked, there came a change&mdash;a rest to deafened ears
  &mdash;a stretch of river that seemed quiet after chaos&mdash;and here for
  the first time he bailed the boat clear of water.</p>

  <p>Jane and Fay were huddled in a corner, with the flapping tarpaulin now
  half fallen over them. They were wet and muddy. Lassiter crouched like a man
  dazed by a bad dream, and his white hair hung, stained and bedraggled, over
  his face. The Indian and the Mormon, grim, hard, worn, stood silent at the
  oar.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was far advanced and the sun had already descended below the
  western ramparts. A cool breeze blew up the canyon, laden with a sound that
  was the same, yet not the same, as those low, dull roars which Shefford
  dreaded more and more.</p>

  <p>Joe Lake turned his ear to the breeze. A stronger puff brought a heavy,
  quivering rumble. This time he did not vent his gay and wild defiance to the
  river. He bent lower&mdash;listened. Then as the rumble became a strange,
  deep, reverberating roll, as if the monstrous river were rolling huge stones
  down a subterranean canyon, Shefford saw with dilating eyes that the Mormon's
  hair was rising stiff upon his head.</p>

  <p>"Hear that!" said Joe, turning an ashen face to Shefford. "We'll drop off
  the earth now. Hang on to the girl, so if we go you can go together... And,
  pard, if you've a God&mdash;pray!"</p>

  <p>Nas Ta Bega faced the bend from whence that rumble came, and he was the
  same dark, inscrutable, impassive Indian as of old. What was death to
  him?</p>

  <p>Shefford felt the strong, rushing love of life surge in him, and it was
  not for himself he thought, but for Fay and the happiness she merited. He
  went to her, patted the covered head, and tried with words choking in his
  throat to give hope. And he leaned with hands gripping the gunwale, with eyes
  wide open, ready for the unknown.</p>

  <p>The river made a quick turn and from round the bend rumbled a terrible
  uproar. The current racing that way was divided or uncertain, and it gave
  strange motion to the boat. Joe and Nas Ta Bega shoved desperately upon the
  oar, all to no purpose. The currents had their will. The bow of the boat took
  the place of the stern. Then swift at the head of a curved incline it shot
  beyond the bulging wall.</p>

  <p>And Shefford saw an awful place before them. The canyon had narrowed to
  half its width, and turned almost at right angles. The huge clamor of
  appalling sound came from under the cliff where the swollen river had to pass
  and where there was not space. The rapid rushed in gigantic swells right upon
  the wall, boomed against it, climbed and spread and fell away, to recede and
  gather new impetus, to leap madly on down the canyon.</p>

  <p>Shefford went to his knees, clasped Fay, and Jane, too. But facing this
  appalling thing he had to look. Courage and despair came to him at the last.
  This must be the end. With long, buoyant swing the boat sailed down, shot
  over the first waves, was caught and lifted upon the great swell and impelled
  straight toward the cliff. Huge whirlpools raced alongside, and from them
  came a horrible, engulfing roar. Monstrous bulges rose on the other side. All
  the stupendous power of that mighty river of downward-rushing silt swung the
  boat aloft, up and up, as the swell climbed the wall. Shefford, with
  transfixed eyes and harrowed soul, watched the wet black wall. It loomed down
  upon him. The stern of the boat went high. Then when the crash that meant
  doom seemed imminent the swell spread and fell back from the wall and the
  boat never struck at all. By some miraculous chance it had been favored by a
  strange and momentary receding of the huge spent swell. Then it slid back,
  was caught and whirled by the current into a red, frothy, up-flung rapids
  below. Shefford bowed his head over. Fay and saw no more, nor felt nor heard.
  What seemed a long time after that the broken voice of the Mormon recalled
  him to his labors.</p>

  <p>The boat was half full of water. Nas Ta Bega scooped out great sheets of
  it with his hands. Shefford sprang to aid him, found the shovel, and plunged
  into the task. Slowly but surely they emptied the boat. And then Shefford saw
  that twilight had fallen. Joe was working the craft toward a narrow bank of
  sand, to which, presently, they came, and the Indian sprang out to moor to a
  rock.</p>

  <p>The fugitives went ashore and, weary and silent and drenched, they dropped
  in the warm sand.</p>

  <p>But Shefford could not sleep. The river kept him awake. In the distance it
  rumbled, low, deep, reverberating, and near at hand it was a thing of mutable
  mood. It moaned, whined, mocked, and laughed. It had the soul of a devil. It
  was a river that had cut its way to the bowels of the earth, and its nature
  was destructive. It harbored no life. Fighting its way through those dead
  walls, cutting and tearing and wearing, its heavy burden of silt was death,
  destruction, and decay. A silent river, a murmuring, strange, fierce,
  terrible, thundering river of the desert! Even in the dark it seemed to wear
  the hue of blood.</p>

  <p>All night long Shefford heard it, and toward the dark hours before dawn,
  when a restless, broken sleep came to him, his dreams were dreams of a river
  of sounds.</p>

  <p>All the beautiful sounds he knew and loved he heard&mdash;the sigh of the
  wind in the pines, the mourn of the wolf, the cry of the laughing-gull, the
  murmur of running brooks, the song of a child, the whisper of a woman. And
  there were the boom of the surf, the roar of the north wind in the forest,
  the roll of thunder. And there were the sounds not of earth&mdash;a river of
  the universe rolling the planets, engulfing the stars, pouring the sea of
  blue into infinite space.</p>

  <p>Night with its fitful dreams passed. Dawn lifted the ebony gloom out of
  the canyon and sunlight far up on the ramparts renewed Shefford's spirit. He
  rose and awoke the others. Fay's wistful smile still held its faith. They ate
  of the gritty, water-soaked food. Then they embarked. The current carried
  them swiftly down and out of hearing of the last rapid. The character of the
  river and the canyon changed. The current lessened to a slow, smooth, silent,
  eddying flow. The walls grew straight, sheer, gloomy, and vast. Shefford
  noted these features, but he was listening so hard for the roar of the next
  rapid that he scarcely appreciated them. All the fugitives were listening.
  Every bend in the canyon&mdash;and now the turns were numerous&mdash; might
  hold a rapid. Shefford strained his ears. He imagined the low, dull, strange
  rumble. He had it in his ears, yet there was the growing sensation of
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Shore this 's a dead place," muttered Lassiter.</p>

  <p>"She's only slowed up for a bigger plunge," replied Joe. "Listen! Hear
  that?"</p>

  <p>But there was no true sound, Joe only imagined what he expected and hated
  and dreaded to hear.</p>

  <p>Mile after mile they drifted through the silent gloom between those vast
  and magnificent walls. After the speed, the turmoil, the whirling, shrieking,
  thundering, the never-ceasing sound and change and motion of the rapids
  above, this slow, quiet drifting, this utter, absolute silence, these eddying
  stretches of still water below, worked strangely upon Shefford's mind and he
  feared he was going mad.</p>

  <p>There was no change to the silence, no help for the slow drift, no
  lessening of the strain. And the hours of the day passed as moments, the sun
  crossed the blue gap above, the golden lights hung on the upper walls, the
  gloom returned, and still there was only the dead, vast, insupportable
  silence.</p>

  <p>There came bends where the current quickened, ripples widened, long lanes
  of little waves roughened the surface, but they made no sound.</p>

  <p>And then the fugitives turned through a V-shaped vent in the canyon. The
  ponderous walls sheered away from the river. There was space and sunshine,
  and far beyond this league-wide open rose vermilion-colored cliffs. A mile
  below the river disappeared in a dark, boxlike passage from which came a
  rumble that made Shefford's flesh creep.</p>

  <p>The Mormon flung high his arms and let out the stentorian yell that had
  rolled down to the fugitives as they waited at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco.
  But now it had a wilder, more exultant note. Strange how he shifted his gaze
  to Fay Larkin!</p>

  <p>"Girl! Get up and look!" he called. "The Ferry! The Ferry!"</p>

  <p>Then he bent his brawny back over the steering-oar, and the clumsy craft
  slowly turned toward the left-hand shore, where a long, low bank of green
  willows and cottonwoods gave welcome relief to the eyes. Upon the opposite
  side of the river Shefford saw a boat, similar to the one he was in, moored
  to the bank.</p>

  <p>"Shore, if I ain't losin' my eyes, I seen an Injun with a red blanket,"
  said Lassiter.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lassiter," cried Shefford. "Look, Fay! Look, Jane! See! Indians
  &mdash;hogans&mdash;mustangs&mdash;there above the green bank!"</p>

  <p>The boat glided slowly shoreward. And the deep, hungry, terrible rumble of
  the remorseless river became something no more to dread.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX.</a> &mdash; WILLOW SPRINGS</h2>

  <p class="first">TWO days' travel from the river, along the saw-toothed range
  of Echo Cliffs, stood Presbrey's trading-post, a little red-stone square
  house in a green and pretty valley called Willow Springs.</p>

  <p>It was nearing the time of sunset&mdash;that gorgeous hour of color in the
  Painted Desert&mdash;when Shefford and his party rode down upon the post.</p>

  <p>The scene lacked the wildness characteristic of Kayenta or Red Lake. There
  were wagons and teams, white men and Indians, burros, sheep, lambs, mustangs
  saddled and unsaddled, dogs, and chickens. A young, sweet-faced woman stood
  in the door of the post and she it was who first sighted the fugitives.
  Presbrey was weighing bags of wool on a scale, and when she called he lazily
  turned, as if to wonder at her eagerness.</p>

  <p>Then he flung up his head, with its shock of heavy hair, in a start of
  surprise, and his florid face lost its lazy indolence to become wreathed in a
  huge smile.</p>

  <p>"Haven't seen a white person in six months!" was his extraordinary
  greeting.</p>

  <p>An hour later Shefford, clean-shaven, comfortably clothed once more, found
  himself a different man; and when he saw Fay in white again, with a new and
  indefinable light shining through that old, haunting shadow in her eyes, then
  the world changed and he embraced perfect happiness.</p>

  <p>There was a dinner such as Shefford had not seen for many a day, and such
  as Fay had never seen, and that brought to Jane Withersteen's eyes the dreamy
  memory of the bountiful feasts which, long years ago, had been her pride. And
  there was a story told to the curious trader and his kind wife&mdash;a story
  with its beginning back in those past years, of riders of the purple sage, of
  Fay Larkin as a child and then as a wild girl in Surprise Valley, of the
  flight down Nonnezoshe Boco an the canyon, of a great Mormon and a noble
  Indian.</p>

  <p>Presbrey stared with his deep-set eyes and wagged his tousled head and
  stared again; then with the quick perception of the practical desert man he
  said:</p>

  <p>"I'm sending teamsters in to Flagstaff to-morrow. Wife and I will go along
  with you. We've light wagons. Three days, maybe&mdash;or four&mdash;and we'll
  be there... Shefford, I'm going to see you marry Fay Larkin!"</p>

  <p>Fay and Jane and Lassiter showed strangely against this background of
  approaching civilization. And Shefford realized more than ever the loneliness
  and isolation and wildness of so many years for them.</p>

  <p>When the women had retired Shefford and the men talked a while. Then Joe
  Lake rose to stretch his big frame.</p>

  <p>"Friends, reckon I'm all in," he said. "Good night." In passing he laid a
  heavy hand on Shefford's shoulder. "Well, you got out. I've only a queer
  notion how. But SOME ONE besides an Indian and a Mormon guided you out!... Be
  good to the girl... Good-by, pard!"</p>

  <p>Shefford grasped the big hand and in the emotion of the moment did not
  catch the significance of Joe's last words.</p>

  <p>Later Shefford stepped outside into the starlight for a few moments' quiet
  walk and thought before he went to bed. It was a white night. The coyotes
  were yelping. The stars shone steadfast, bright, cold. Nas Ta Bega stalked
  out of the shadow of the house and joined Shefford. They walked in silence.
  Shefford's heart was too full for utterance and the Indian seldom spoke at
  any time. When Shefford was ready to go in Nas Ta Bega extended his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-by&mdash;Bi Nai!" he said, strangely, using English and Navajo in
  what Shefford supposed to be merely good night. The starlight shone full upon
  the dark, inscrutable face of the Indian. Shefford bade him good night and
  then watched him stride away in the silver gloom.</p>

  <p>But next morning Shefford understood. Nas Ta Bega and Joe Lake were gone.
  It was a shock to Shefford. Yet what could he have said to either? Joe had
  shirked saying good-by to him and Fay. And the Indian had gone out of
  Shefford's life as he had come into it.</p>

  <p>What these two men represented in Shefford's uplift was too great for the
  present to define, but they and the desert that had developed them had taught
  him the meaning of life. He might fail often, since failure was the lot of
  his kind, but could he ever fail again in faith in man or God while he had
  mind to remember the Indian and the Mormon?</p>

  <p>Still, though he placed them on a noble height and loved them well, there
  would always abide with him a sorrow for the Mormon and a sleepless and
  eternal regret for that Indian on his lonely cedar slope with the spirits of
  his vanishing race calling him.</p>

  <p class="first">WILLOW SPRINGS appeared to be a lively place that morning.
  Presbrey was gay and his sweet-faced wife was excited. The teamsters were a
  jolly, whistling lot. And the lean mustangs kicked and bit at one another.
  The trader had brought out two light wagons for the trip, and, after the
  manner of desert men, desired to start at sunrise.</p>

  <p>Far across the Painted Desert towered the San Francisco peaks, black-
  timbered, blue-canyoned, purple-hazed, with white snow, like the clouds,
  around their summits.</p>

  <p>Jane Withersteen looked at the radiant Fay and lived again in her
  happiness. And at last excitement had been communicated to the old
  gun-man.</p>

  <p>"Shore we're goin' to live with Fay an' John, an' be near Venters an'
  Bess, an' see the blacks again, Jane... An' Venters will tell you, as he did
  me, how Wrangle run Black Star off his legs!"</p>

  <p>All connected with that early start was sweet, sad, hopeful.</p>

  <p>And so they rode away from Willow Springs, through the green fields of
  alfalfa and cotton wood, down the valley with its smoking hogans and
  whistling mustangs and scarlet-blanketed Indians, and out upon the bare,
  ridgy, colorful desert toward the rosy sunrise.</p>

  <h2><a id="epi"
     name="epi">EPILOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the outskirts of a little town in Illinois there was a
  farm of rolling pasture-land. And here a beautiful meadow, green and red in
  clover, merged upon an orchard in the midst of which a brown-tiled roof
  showed above the trees.</p>

  <p>One afternoon in May a group of people, strangely agitated, walked down a
  shady lane toward the meadow.</p>

  <p>"Wal, Jane, I always knew we'd get a look at them hosses again&mdash;I
  shore knew," Lassiter was saying in the same old, cool, careless drawl. But
  his clawlike hands shook a little.</p>

  <p>"Oh! will they know me?" asked Jane Withersteen, turning to a stalwart man
  &mdash;no other than the dark-faced Venters, her rider of other days.</p>

  <p>"Know you? I'll bet they will," replied Venters. "What do you say,
  Bess?"</p>

  <p>The shadow brightened in Bess's somber blue eyes, as if his words had
  recalled her from a sad and memorable past.</p>

  <p>"Black Star will know her, surely," replied Bess. "Sometimes he points his
  nose toward the west and watches as if he saw the purple slopes and smelt the
  sage of Utah! He has never forgotten. But Night has grown deaf and partly
  blind of late. I doubt if he'd remember."</p>

  <p>Shefford and Fay walked arm in arm in the background.</p>

  <p>Out in the meadow two horses were grazing. They were sleek, shiny, long-
  maned, long-tailed, black as coal, and, though old, still splendid in every
  line.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember them?" whispered Shefford.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I only needed to see Black Star," murmured Fay, her voice quivering.
  "I can remember being lifted on his back... How strange! It seems so long
  ago... Look! Mother Jane is going out to them."</p>

  <p>Jane Withersteen advanced alone through the clover, and it was with
  unsteady steps. Presently she halted. What glorious and bitter memories were
  expressed in her strange, poignant call!</p>

  <p>Black Star started and swept up his noble head and looked. But Night went
  on calmly grazing. Then Jane called again&mdash;the same strange call, only
  louder, and this time broken. Black Star raised his head higher and he
  whistled a piercing blast. He saw Jane; he knew her as he had remembered the
  call; and he came pounding toward her. She met him, encircled his neck with
  her arms, and buried her face in his mane.</p>

  <p>"Shore I reckon I'd better never say any more about Wrangle runnin' the
  blacks off their legs thet time," muttered Lassiter, as if to himself.</p>

  <p>"Lassiter, you only dreamed that race," replied Venters, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bern, isn't it good that Black Star remembered her&mdash;that she'll
  have him&mdash;something left of her old home?" asked Bess, wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Indeed it is good. But, Bess, Jane Withersteen will find a new spirit and
  new happiness here."</p>

  <p>Jane came toward them, leading both horses. "Dear friends, I am happy. To-
  day I bury all regrets. Of the past I shall remember only&mdash;my riders of
  the purple sage."</p>

  <p>Venters smiled his gladness. "And you&mdash;Lassiter&mdash;what shall you
  remember?" he queried.</p>

  <p>The old gun-man looked at Jane and then at his clawlike hands and then at
  Fay. His eyes lost their shadow and began to twinkle.</p>

  <p>"Wal, I rolled a stone once, but I reckon now thet time Wrangle
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lassiter, I said you dreamed that race. Wrangle never beat the blacks,"
  interrupted Venters... "And you, Fay, what shall you remember?"</p>

  <p>"Surprise Valley," replied Fay, dreamily.</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;Shefford?"</p>

  <p>Shefford shook his head. For him there could never be one memory only. In
  his heart there would never change or die memories of the wild uplands, of
  the great towers and walls, of the golden sunsets on the canyon ramparts, of
  the silent, fragrant valleys where the cedars and the sago-lilies grew, of
  those starlit nights when his love and faith awoke, of grand and lonely
  Nonnezoshe, of that red, sullen, thundering, mysterious Colorado River, of a
  wonderful Indian and a noble Mormon&mdash;of all that was embodied for him in
  the meaning of the rainbow trail.</p><br>
