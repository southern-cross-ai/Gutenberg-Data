<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>01. &mdash; HORATIO'S CONFESSION OF HOPE</h2>

<h3>ON A QUEENSLAND STATION</h3>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Brisbane Courier</i>, 13 December 1873</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
EVERYBODY says that I was made a regular fool of, so I suppose
that I was. Anyhow, I will tell all about it, and leave the
reader to judge for himself.</p>

<p>I was a new chum when the following events happened, and I
resided on Idolvale Station, where I was supposed to be acquiring
what is known as "colonial experience." Old Wiggins was the owner
of said Idolvale, and a decent enough old fellow he was. Mrs
Wiggins was boss (I trust I am not obscure). Miss Wiggins, aged
five and twenty, more or less, was second boss. I beg to state
that all names of persons, places, and everything else are of
course fictitious. I might be getting my head punched if I am not
careful.</p>

<p>I paid old Wiggins the sum of one hundred pounds per annum, in
return for which he kindly allowed me to help milk the cows in
the morning, tail cattle when required, and do a little amateur
fencing. On the other hand, I had the pleasure of being
introduced to all visitors, under the sounding title of Mr
Horatio Spoffy, of turning over the leaves of Miss W's music, and
putting her up on her horse when she went out for her evening
ride. I intend to make this as short as possible, so shall
introduce to you only the real actors in the amusing episode,
please therefore to take the usual number of station hands on a
good sized cattle station, neighbours, etc., as so much left to
the imaginative powers of the reader.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiggins was a woman who always had a grievance; now it was the state of her health, then Mr. Wiggins' backslidings, now the
dullness of bush life; but her favorite subject was the scarcity
of good domestic servants. I am a young man of singularly
prepossessing appearance, and noble, open manner, attracted, I
suppose, by this, Mrs. W. was good enough to make me a receptacle
of the many troubles of her life, and almost persuaded me into
the belief that she was really and truly a bona-fide martyr. She
also in confidence told me what an amiable creature Caroline was,
what a model daughter, etc, for all of which I, of course, felt
duly honored.</p>

<p>Knowing as I did Mrs. Wiggins' pet grievance, I had grown
accustomed to the constant change of cooks and housemaids, and
therefore felt no surprise when one day, in the course of
conversation, Mrs. Wiggins announced the expected advent of a new
housemaid that evening. Little did I think how that arrival
forebode sorrow for me; the coming events cast no shadow before
it.</p>

<p>I stood at the piano that night, in my usual graceful
attitude, and listened to Miss W, as, with languishing eyes, she
sang, "Oh! stay with me, my darling, stay," when a knock was
heard at the door, and a voice informed Old Wiggins, who was
sleeping the sleep of the just in his arm chair, that "Soopgot,
the carrier, had come."</p>

<p>Old W. arose, growling like the typical bear of being
disturbed from his slumbers; as he departed, said Mrs. Wiggins,
"James, if the new servant is there, send her up to me."</p>

<p>James went, and shortly afterwards a light foot-step came
along the hall, and in answer to Mrs. Wiggins' "come in," there
appeared a slender figured girl, with a face like a Madonna,
downcast brown eyes and pretty, pouty lips.</p>

<p>"Folding her pale hands so meekly," whilst Mrs. Wiggins put her
through her facings, she answered all queries in a low, but firm
voice. Mrs. W having finished entreating some person or persons
unknown to stay with her for the term of their natural lives,
wheeled round on the music stool, and stared at the newcomer as
though she were a horse brought in for inspection. I, artful dog,
picked up a piece of music, and over the top of that took a sly
glance at her.</p>

<p>"She seems a respectable sort of girl," said Mrs. W, after
dismissing Jessie, that being the name she confessed to.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Miss, "but very plain, don't you think so Mr
Spoffy?"</p>

<p>I, arch hypocrite, replied that "I had scarcely looked at her."
(Hadn't I though?) I fell head ever heels in love with her before
she had shut the door.</p>

<p>Old Wiggins came back. Miss expressed her opinion vocally that
"He would come back, she knew he would."</p>

<p>Bed time arrived in due course, and I went to bed only to
dream that I was drafting on the main camp, and trying to cut
Jessie out from amongst a mob of Carolines, when just as I had
succeeded, she turned into a bullock, charged, and knocked me
into a water hole. I awoke to find my head in the wash hand
basin, and my heels on the pillow. I mention this dream because
it was in some sort prophetic.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days, Mrs. W. stated her opinion that
the new maid was a perfect treasure. We had had a good many
treasures at the start, so that I did not lay much stress on
that. All the males around about, of high and low degree, were
agreed on the one point, that she was the prettiest little girl
to be seen anywhere, for what human heart that beat beneath his
waistcoat (a shirt I should say, for waistcoats are not much worn
in the bush) could withstand those eyes, and oh! such ankles.</p>

<p>All the other women, of course, said that she is nothing at
all to look at, in fact, made her out to be positively ugly.</p>

<p>Two months had nearly passed, and considering the difficulties
incidental to our respective positions, and the holy dread I had
of incurring the resentment of either Mrs. or Miss Wiggins,
managed to push my acquaintanceship with pretty Jessie, towards,
as I thought, a favorable termination. She and the sweetest of
smiles to me in return for elegant compliments that I paid her,
and accepted the presents I made her with murmured thanks and an
upward look of gratitude that rendered me a hopeless lump of
humanity for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Young Clockett, the owner of the next station, was always over
at Idolvale now, and even old Mackintosh, from Bugaboo might be
seen coming in that direction far more often than business
required.</p>

<p>In fact, it was quite the fashion about that particular
portion of the district for the young fellows to chaff one
another about Mother Wiggins' pretty housemaid. Jessie accepted
all their attentions presents as matter of course, she gave all
for a fair field and no favor, and taught her many admirers to
behave respectfully. In fact, young De Nekty, who was in the
civil service in &mdash;&mdash; just fancied himself as a
lady-killer, and was stopping on a visit at Idolvale, coming down
as one morning, and finding Jessie alone dusting the rooms, tried
to take a kiss, and had a vase broken over his head in return,
and was informed in addition that "he was the essence of a cad,"
which however, he wasn't for he took it in very good part, and
told Mrs. Wiggins that he broke the vase, averting thereby the
wrath of that lady.</p>

<p>Now Clockett had a stockman, a quiet sort of fellow called
Jack Devitt; he came to Clockett's about a month previously,
looking for work, which he obtained, and turning out a very good
hand, was retained permanently. The only account he gave of
himself was that he had been unfortunate on the diggings, and
wished to make a small rise in order to try his luck again. A
very quiet fellow was master Jack, and though civil spoken
enough, had an air of independence about him that made you
somehow feel that there was more about the fellow than he chose
to let you see.</p>

<p>I always thought that Jack had seen Jessie before somewhere
for the first time that he came over to Idolvale, I thought she
was going to faint when she saw him, but he took no notice of
her, and in fact accrued quite indifferent to the charms of the
household beauty. The account Jessie gave of herself was that she
had come to &mdash;&mdash; as a barmaid, but not liking the life,
had taken the first situation that offered, which proved to be
Mrs. W.'s.</p>

<p>As to where she came from before that, or anything about her
past life, nobody over succeeded in eliciting any information
from her.</p>

<p>I was riding through the bush with Jack one day during the
muster, and in my superior, condescending manner chaffed him
about the girl. Ignoring altogether my allusion to himself, Jack
quietly replied, "Don't let that girl make a fool of you, Mr
Spoffy; she is a conceited little flirt."</p>

<p>I laughed, though I must confess rather foolishly. The idea!
Horatio Spoffy, who had broken hearts in England, being made a
fool of by a little colonial servant girl. Ha ha!</p>

<p>One more little episode, and I come to the final denouement:
Mrs. Wiggins was, or feigned to be, quite unconscious of the
admiration Jessie was exciting in the inflammable breasts of
surrounding makes. The fact was, Jessie was such an admirable
servant that Mrs. W., who could appreciate comfort as well as most
people, was not at all inclined to part with her. However, one
unfortunate morning old W. put his foot into in, and thereby
brought Jessie into the old lady's bad books. I had finished my
breakfast before work in the milking-yard, and was sitting in the
verandah, when I heard Mr. Wise slippered feet come into the
breakfast-room just behind me. He rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Jessie, bring me my boots, please."</p>

<p>The obedient handmaiden appeared with them in due course, and
stooped to place them on the ground before his arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Why Jessie, girl, how fresh you look this morning," I heard
the old fellow say, and, looking round saw him administer a
paternal pat on the blooming cheek of the neat-handed Phyllis.
Somebody else saw the innocent action too!</p>

<p>"Mr. Wiggins! James!" sounded in an awful voice from the door,
"how dare you! Leave the room instantly, you impudent,
bold-faced hussy," said Mrs. Wiggins, turning on Jessie.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Wiggins. I would not have been in his shoes at
that moment for a trifle. "Don't attempt to excuse your conduct,"
said Mrs. W., "I saw you myself. You an old man with a faithful
wife! Oh! and a loving daughter! Oh! Oh! kissing that abandoned
creature."</p>

<p>It was too much, she should have kept to the truth the worm
turned.</p>

<p>"I did not kiss her, Caroline, nor think of doing so; I merely
patted her cheek quite innocently, and&mdash;and&mdash;if I had
kissed her, she is better worth, kissing than ever you were."</p>

<p>Under cover of this broadside, Wiggins fled the field, and Mrs
W. fell into hysterics on the sofa, with a shriek.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
A shriek that echoed through the joisted roof,<br>

And up the hills it rang with horrid clatter<br>

The kangaroos who browsed there, far aloof,<br>

Jumped, crying, "What's the matter!"</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was a balmy evening in May, some short time after the
before-mentioned incident, that I resume my narrative. How the
old couple made it up, I know not; this only do I know, that Mrs
and Miss W. sported now and resplendent jewellery, and Mr. W.
never, never by any chance looked towards Jessie. It was a balmy
evening' as I said before; the golden king of day sank behind the
distant hills, throwing a last lingering, glorious look over the
fair plains, smiling like a black gin over a fig of tobacco, so.
I was standing in the verandah, twisting up a cracker, admiring
the fit of a new pair of moleskins and thinking, with a conscious
smile, of the impression they would make on Jessie's susceptible
heart. Wiggins was expatiating to Mackintosh on the merits of a
newly-purchased Hereford bull. Clockett, who had ridden over on
some lame excuse, made the striking and original remark that he
saw the mailman coming that being the first speech he had favored
us with since saying, "How do you do?"</p>

<p>Mailbag brought in and opened. Letters all round. One for me,
to the effect that old uncle Benjamin had shuffled off this
mortal coil, and left me about eight thousand pounds. He was a
kind old fellow, and I did really feel sorry to hear of his
death, and rather inclined to take Miss W. up short, when with
outstretched band and beaming eyes, she said, "Oh, Mr. Spoffy, how
I do congratulate you."</p>

<p>But I am going ahead of my story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiggins, having overlooked the directions of Wiggins'
letters, and seeing no female handwriting amongst them, permitted
him to read in peace, Mackintosh, finding everybody rather
absent-minded, said good-bye, and rode off. The ladies, having
asked Mr. Clockett to accompany them for a drive which he
declined, saying that he was in a desperate hurry to get home,
departed for their constitutional on wheels.</p>

<p>Clockett, who had suddenly forgotten his haste, muttered
something about going to look at the plan of the stables (to know
every slab in them), and was strolling off when Wiggins, starting
out of a reverie into which he had fallen since reading his
letters, said, "If you I are going to the back, Clockett, here is
a letter for Jessie, you can give to her or one of the servants
as you pass. Spoffy, just take a turn with me, will you?"</p>

<p>Linking his arm in mine, who strolled about, without his
speaking a word, for some time. At last he said, "I want you to
be up before daylight to-morrow, and go down the paddock and
catch Tartar for me. I am going to B&mdash;&mdash; to-morrow, and
do not want the old woman to know till I am gone."</p>

<p>I felt rather surprised, and I suppose showed it, for after a
bit he went on:</p>

<p>"You know, Spoffy, I got into G. and Westlands some time ago,
and what with commission, interest, and all the many ways these
fellows have of swelling the account, together with my own
expenses, fencing, etc, I am rather behind hand. They are going
to put the screw on, I hear by this post; and unless I can raise
the money before next week, it will be all up with Idolvale. Now,
if the old woman know that I was going down to B&mdash;&mdash; in
a hurry, she would give me no peace till I gave her the reason
and I don't want her to know until I am obliged to toll for I may
make it all right yet."</p>

<p>I felt sorry for the old boy, and had my newly-acquired
capital been in my pocket in hard cash, should doubtless have
pressed him to accept it. Fortunately it was not, and remembering
that some time must necessarily elapse before I could touch it, I
wisely contented myself with promising to hold my tongue, and
have his horse up ready in the morning.</p>

<p>We went back to the house; Wiggins plunged into a little don
he called his office I turned into the dining-room, where there
seemed to be a low murmur of voices going on. Pre-occupied as I
was, as I entered I had a confused notion of seeing Jessie fly
out of the room in tears, and Clockett standing at the table
looking rather foolish.</p>

<p>"Been taking a stroll with the old man?" he said, and seemed
busy putting something into his pocket that looked like a
cheque-book. "Well, good-bye for the present," he went on,
holding out his hand. "When shall I see you over at my
place?"</p>

<p>"Stay to dinner," I said.</p>

<p>"No, thanks; I must be off. Jack has left&mdash;did I tell
you?"</p>

<p>"No; thought he suited you A.1."</p>

<p>"So he did; very good man. But he got some money from
somewhere, and wouldn't stop. Broken down swell, I think.
Good-bye, old follow."</p>

<p>He left the room, but it must have been nearly half an hour
before I saw him cantering across the plain.</p>

<p>The coast being pretty clear, I thought it would be a fine
opportunity to have a flirtation with Jessie; so strolled towards
the back regions, chuckling as I thought what a successful dog I
was amongst the petticoats. The first thing I saw on getting into
the passage and a charming picture it made was Jessie's lithe
figure leaning against the pantry door, her pretty face buried in
her pocket handkerchief. I am no stronger than the rest of my sex
where a woman's tears are concerned, and was by her side in an
instant, beseeching her to tell me the cause of her trouble,
whilst my arm stole insidiously round her waist. She sobbed out
for a few seconds; then drawing herself away she said, "I did not
think that you would have taken advantage of my being in grief to
insult me, Mr. Spoffy."</p>

<p>"I insult you, Jessie? I am so sorry as I can be for you. Tell
me what it is."</p>

<p>She had ceased crying, but looked steadily away from me, and
her frame seemed convulsed with emotion.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Jessie," I pleaded.</p>

<p>"I cannot," she said. "My troubles are my own."</p>

<p>"But perhaps I can assist you."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Try me," I said. I had taken her hand, and its warm clasp
acted like a galvanic battery. "Is it money you want?"</p>

<p>She snatched away her hand. "Money! and from you?"</p>

<p>"And why not, Jessie? I love you. Do, thou, let me help
you."</p>

<p>"You love me! Yes! I am pretty girl, and a servant, so you
think that you can make a fool of me! and also broke out sobbing
again.</p>

<p>"Indeed! indeed, Jessie, I love you truly and honorably. Oh,
believe me!"</p>

<p>Her tear-stained cheeks and enchanting ways put me quite
beside myself.</p>

<p>"Dare I hope that you mean it?" and she turned two swimming
eyes up to mine.</p>

<p>"I am true, Jessie; I am!" I said, nearly ready to cry
myself.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you all." Just then the whole of the buggy
were heard, bringing the ladies back from their drive. "I must
go," said Jessie; "but meet me here to-night." I got a hurried
kiss somewhere on the top of her head, and she was gone.</p>

<p>Oh! how long it seemed to bedtime that night. Wiggins was
nearly as absented as myself, and answered several times at
random.</p>

<p>"Papa is in love, I think&mdash;" said Missey, glancing archly at
me, and emphasizing the "love;" "&mdash;and you, too, Mr. Spoffy,"
she concluded, giggling.</p>

<p>Mrs. W. glanced scornfully at her helpmate, who was doing his
best to keep trouble from her door, and snorted
contemptuously.</p>

<p>The clock struck ten. Mrs. W. yawned, and announced her
intention of retiring. Miss W. dutifully followed suit. My
prayers for their sound slumbers followed also. Half-past ten,
Wiggins said "Good-night," to which he whispered, like a second
Charles, the mystic word, "Remember!"</p>

<p>I was getting impatient, and taking off my boots, stole to the
trysting place. I had to wait some time before a white-robed
figure came gliding noiselessly along, and my shy little Jessie
nestled for a moment in my arms, and then drew away.</p>

<p>"It is very wrong, I know, to meet you like this alone at
night; but I am so unhappy."</p>

<p>An emphatic hand squeeze was my answer.</p>

<p>"Your sympathy I may have," she went on.</p>

<p>"Tell me, darling, all your trouble," I said.</p>

<p>In a low voice, Jessie told her simple tale. A widowed mother,
an invalid sister, a long-standing debt, and a hard creditor,
who, unless paid off, would sell the small farm on which they
resided, leaving them homeless.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clockett caught me crying over the letter," said Jessie,
"and would insist on hearing all about it. He would have given me
some money, too, but I could not take it from him," and she gave
a great sob. Fancy this tale told in the dead stillness of the
night, to a young fellow of one-and-twenty, by a velvet checked
girl, with her hair hanging down her back, and crying her heart
out on your shoulder! This was the second tale of money
embarrassment poured into my ear. But how different the narrator
one young and winsome the other old and prosaic.</p>

<p>"Jessie, you will let me give you the money."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no."</p>

<p>"But you must be reasonable now; surely you would rather be
indebted to me than see your poor mother turned out of her home?
How much is it?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-five pounds," came a low voice.</p>

<p>I had a balance at the bank of one hundred and odd pounds and
bidding Jessie wait till I came back, I stole to my room, and got
my check book.</p>

<p>"Come into the dining-room;" and like, two ghosts we crept
in. Jessie cautiously lit a candle, and stood with her arm
lovingly through mine, whilst I drew out a cheque for one hundred
pounds. When I handed it to her she glanced at the amount.</p>

<p>"You are a dear old fellow," she said, in quite an altered
voice, throwing her arms round my neck and giving me an earnest
kiss. The next moment I was alone.</p>

<p>I must say I thought that an hour or two's mild spooning would
not have come amiss after transacting business; but Jessie's
modesty fired up at the bare thought of stopping up with me after
the others were all in bed, so with solemn promises of meeting
again, I had to content myself.</p>

<p>I went to bed, but slept not. The house seemed full of
mysterious voices and subdued whispers. Several times I could
have sworn to hearing a stifled laugh from somewhere. But at 4
o'clock, when I got up to further old Wiggin's departure,
everything was quiet.</p>

<p>Wiggins was standing at the door with his boots in his hand
when I got back with his horse, and daylight was peeping gray and
ghost-like over the distant trees.</p>

<p>"I shall be back the day after to-morrow," he said. "I have
left a letter in your room for you to give Mrs. Wiggins.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>About one o'clock that morning Miss Wiggins came tripping into
the room.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Spoffy. Have you seen papa any where?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Wiggins; but will you give this note to Mrs
Wiggins?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why, it's pa's writing!" and she flew out of the room
like a startled kangaroo rat.</p>

<p>Very soon afterwards Mrs. W. bustled in.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wiggins says that he has had to leave home this morning
to arrange some very important business in B&mdash;. Do you know
anything more, Mr. Spoffy?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Wiggins," I commenced.</p>

<p>But she went on, "Why, how is this? No breakfast laid. Call
that lazy girl up directly."</p>

<p>"Jessie! Jessie!" resounded through the house, but no
answering "Yes, marm." I began to feel very queer.</p>

<p>"Her room is empty," said missy, coming back.</p>

<p>"Mary!" screamed Mrs. Wiggins. The cook appeared.</p>

<p>"Where is Jessie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mam."</p>

<p>"But you do know you must know!" asserted Mrs. Wiggins,
vehemently.</p>

<p>"I know no more than that dog where she is. All I know is that
she said late last night that she was going for a pleasure trip
down to B&mdash;&mdash;, and that Mr. Clockett and Mr. Spoffy were
going to shout!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiggins stared at me with dilated eyes, whilst my brain
seemed in a whirl.</p>

<p>"They have gone together!" she yelled, in a voice like a
bo'sun; "and you helped them! Deceived! Abandoned!" and without
the slightest warning she fainted, and fell against me. We should
both have fallen prostrate, but for a convenient chair into which
we tumbled. Of the scene that ensued I cannot write
distinctly.</p>

<p>It was a babel of crying, talking, abusing, scolding, me and
every time that I attempted flight I was brought back with, "Do
not desert us, Mr. Spoffy, in our affliction."</p>

<p>Of course I endeavored to make Mrs. Wiggins understand the real
cause of her husband's absence, but it was all in vain.</p>

<p>"Embarrassed circumstances I never heard of before," she said.
"And where is Jessie, Mr. Spoffy; girls don't go for pleasure
trips by themselves. Oh!" and she clenched her hands and tooth,
"if I could just drop upon them I'd spoil their pleasure trip!"
And no doubt she would.</p>

<p>As for my share in the explanations, I confess that, in face
of those two tearful, injured women, I denied all knowledge of
Jessie's remark about Clockett and I having shouted. What else
could I do alone in the house with two women who only wanted an
object on which to expend the vials of their wrath? Luther or
Cranmer would have denied had they stood in my bluchers.</p>

<p><br>
TWO days passed, and such days! Everybody went staggering
about their work as though the finest joke in existence had
happened. Clockett never showed up. Somebody carried the news
over there, and after receipt of it he was said to have d&mdash;d
everything an inch high and an hour old, and led all hands on the
station the lives of dogs.</p>

<p>No news came to us of the absent. Nothing was found in
Jessie's room but some worthless articles of clothes and a
letter, which, however, throw no light on the subject. It ran as
follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Dolly</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">You may plunge for a hundred between the two,
but no more and no matrimony. I mean it.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">J.D.</span></p>

<p><br>
THE second day passed, but no Wiggins. Until now my belief in
his innocence had been strong; but now&mdash;. Wild speculations
began to course through my brain. Every time I looked at the butt
of my cheque-book, my hopes of Wiggins grew fainter. I had been
thrown over for an ugly old married man, and made to pay the
expenses of their trip to B&mdash;. There was madness in the
thought, added to the impossibility of believing that such a girl
as Jessie could act so, and I was in a maze of perfect
perplexity. Mrs. Wiggins and her daughter never ceased to abuse
Jessie, and say what a blessing it was to have such a friend as I
was, at such a trying time. This at last reached such a pitch
that I determined to stop it by confessing my backsliding as
regarded the guilty fair one. But my awe of Mrs. Wiggins was so
great, and I commenced in such a confused manner, that she
imagined I was declaring my passion for her daughter, and
accepted me forthwith!</p>

<p>After that, I remember things but in a confused manner, until
the return of Wiggins, which event happened nearly a week after
his hasty departure. That I remember well. The innocent,
guileless manner in which he rode up to the door; the look, the
indescribable look upon Mrs. W.'s face; the way in which Miss
Wiggins hung upon my neck, and entreated her dear Horatio to be
calm.</p>

<p>He spoke first; the betrayer spoke: "Well, old girl, I
surprised you the other morning; but I have made it all
right."</p>

<p>"Don't touch me! Don't come near me! Go back to your Jessie,
you disgraceful old sinner!"</p>

<p>Which opened the widest&mdash;Wiggins' mouth or eyes&mdash;I
know not.</p>

<p>"Whatever do you mean?" he managed to gasp.</p>

<p>"How dare you show your vile, guilty face before your
outraged, injured, abused wife, and bereaved daughter, you awful
old scoundrel!"</p>

<p>This calmed Wiggins somewhat; he gave his wife a reproachful
look, and turned to me. "Do you know what she means, Spoffy?"</p>

<p>"Be calm, dear," whispered Miss W. I had not the slightest
intention of being anything else, for I felt sure that Wiggins
was innocent.</p>

<p>"Jessie has run away, and we thought you had taken her," was
what I said.</p>

<p>"Gone! has she? That was her, then, I saw in B&mdash;, with
Clockett's stockman, Devitt. And you, Caroline, were so foolish
as to imagine that a man of my years, with enough troubles,
heaven knows, would go feeling after a girl about the country,
merely because she has brown eyes and a pretty figure. After
being my wife for thirty years, you thought no better of me than
that! For shame! Not another word. Do you hear? Come in, and I
will tell you what I have been doing."</p>

<p>If he had been the Iron Duke himself, his voice and manner
could not have been more determined. Mrs. Wiggins saw that he
meant it, and obeyed at once.</p>

<p><br>
"SO you want Caroline, you young dog!" he said, facetiously, a
few hours afterwards. "You are the very fellow I would have
chosen."</p>

<p><br>
I WAS walking down Q&mdash;&mdash; street, in B&mdash;&mdash;
sometime afterwards, plunged in gloomy thought, when I saw Jack
Devitt in the flesh walking towards me. He was well dressed, and
quite a different looking individual to Clockett's
rough-and-ready stockman. I felt very indignant when the fellow
came up and offered to shake hands.</p>

<p>"What's the row?" he said, laughingly. "Is it because I was
working as a stockman you won't know me?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Devitt," I said, "you might be a stockman and a
gentleman both, but not gentleman and a swindler."</p>

<p>"Come, be civil," he said, flushing up. "I don't want to have
a row with you. I suppose you were touched; but how did I swindle
you?"</p>

<p>"You helped Jessie to do it, at any rate."</p>

<p>He laughed so loud and long that the passersby stopped to look
at him.</p>

<p>"The wicked little devil!" was all that I could make out.
"Come in here, and I will tell all I know," he said, when he
stopped laughing.</p>

<p>We went into the parlor of a neighboring hotel.</p>

<p>"Try some P.B.; you will stand it better. Now then: Twelve
months ago I had a few hundreds, and am sorry to say was knocking
them down in Melbourne in the approved style, during which
performance I became acquainted with Jessie, as you know
her&mdash;Dolly Vardon, as she was called then. The money was
soon gone, and I cleared out for the diggings, No luck there and
after working until I was penniless, I started looking for work,
and took a job of stock riding with Clockett, as you know.
Hearing the fellows talking about Wiggins' pretty servant girl, I
went over on some excuse to see her. Imagine my amazement when I
saw my demure Dolly playing the part she was then engaged in! She
was frightened, I can tell you, under a belief that I would tell
tales about her but it was too good a joke to spoil, and I kept
quiet. She meant to marry either you or Clockett; but I would not
stand that, and told her so, for which both of you owe me some
thanks. For also had you both caught, you can't deny."</p>

<p>I groaned in spirit.</p>

<p>"What brought her up there, I cannot tell; but she was
heartily sick of it before she had been there long. Perhaps she
had a longing after me, after all; but that is neither here nor
there. To cut it short, seeing that I put a veto I on her
matrimonial schemes, and hearing that I had come in for a little
money, which she hoped to share, she asked me to lend her a
horse, and bring her down to town. I did so, as it suited me to
leave just then but, on arriving here, gave her plainly to
understand that I was not to be caught. So she took her departure
for Melbourne, dressed in the deepest and most becoming mourning.
She told the passengers on board that she was an orphan going
tomorrow strange and distant relations in Victoria. All the males
married and single were eager to console her, and all the women
to throw her overboard. I believe she ultimately entangled a rich
old contractor, and is now, I believe, Mrs. O'Rowney, and a house
in Melbourne."</p>

<p>"Then all that yarn about her invalid sister and mother, was,
of course, fudge; but I need not ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not altogether; I believe she has got a mother in the
position described, and, schemer as she is, I believe that half
the money she got out of you and Clockett was sent to her."</p>

<p>"That is the hardest of all to believe," I said, rising to
go.</p>

<p>"Sounds tough, does it not?" said Jack, and we parted.</p>

<p><br>
THE MAIL has arrived, and with it a letter saying that a later
will of Uncle Benjamin's has been found, cutting me out. Mrs
Wiggins says that unless I can explain that mysterious money
affair in connection with Jessie, she cannot consent to my
marriage with her daughter. I have only twenty pounds in the
world, and I start for the Palmer to-morrow, where there are no
man catchers at present. I am free! Hurrah!</p>

<p>And wiser&mdash;I hope.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>02. &mdash; THE LADY ERMETTA; OR, THE SLEEPING SECRET</h2>

<p class="chaphead">
A Sensational Novelette in Three Parts,<br>
With an Orthodox Christmas Introduction</p>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, 25 December 1875</h3>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was Christmas Day, and I, the wearied super of a cattle
station far out in the back country, was swinging idly in a
hammock, in an iron-roofed verandah, where the thermometer stood
at a hundred and ten; and imagining that I was keeping a merry
Christmas. Not a sound, save the indistinct hum of insect life,
was to be heard; all hands on the station, having succumbed to
the influence of colonial rum and pudding, were asleep; and I lay
and perspired, and smoked, and thought&mdash;of what? That is a
question that will be answered directly. With my hands clasped
under the back of my head, one foot projecting over the side of
the hammock, and occasionally touching the verandah post in order
to keep myself swinging, I began gradually to lose full
consciousness of surrounding objects. I knew that it seemed to be
getting hotter and hotter, that the iron roof overhead appeared
to be assuming a molten appearance; that I was getting too lazy
to keep myself rocking, that my eyelids were growing heavy, and
that I should soon give it up and fall asleep, when I heard a
deep, deep sigh close to me. I turned&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Saw throned on a flowery rise,<br>

One sitting on a crimson scarf unrolled.</p>

<br>

<p>Well, not exactly.</p>

<p>This was a man, and he was sitting in one of the squatter
chairs leaning against the slabs, and a curious looking figure he
was to see in such a situation. I knew him at once; he was the
Genius of Christmas. There he was, holly wreath, white beard,
laughing countenance, and all the attributes complete. I said,
"Good day, old man&mdash;how are you?" for I felt astonishingly
bold somehow. He was reading in a large book, the print of which
seemed possessed with life, and to be constantly moving and
changing; but when I made this remark he raised his head, and
gazed at me with "a countenance more in sorrow than in anger,"
but did not speak.</p>

<p>"I know who you are," I went on; "you're the Genius of
Christmas."</p>

<p>"I am," he said.</p>

<p>"And you're going to show me all manner of pictures and scenes
of human life, and I shall awake by-and-by and find that it has
all been a dream; and I shall be very good and charitable all the
rest of my life."</p>

<p>"Not you," said the Spirit; "you couldn't be charitable if you
tried."</p>

<p>"Spirit," I said, "that's very hard, why could I not be
charitable if I tried?"</p>

<p>"When you couldn't show mercy to a poor old ghost who's been
harped upon, and written about, and carolled over,&mdash;there,
I'll say no more; but man's inhumanity to me makes a Christmas
Spirit mourn."</p>

<p>"Spirit," I said, "you mistake, surely, I who esteem and
venerate the Christmas season."</p>

<p>"You do, do you? Now, answer me truly, were you not trying to
compose a Christmas tale as you lay in that hammock?"</p>

<p>"I confess it, I was."</p>

<p>"And you say you venerate me; pretty veneration I call that,
but I'll be revenged. I'll stand it no longer. I'll read
Christmas poetry to you for the next three hundred and sixty-five
days."</p>

<p>"Spirit, do not judge me unheard; be calm."</p>

<p>"Be calm! Who could be calm under such provocation? Listen! We
are seven,&mdash;that's Wordsworth isn't it,&mdash;never mind, as
I said before, we are seven; seven spirits, one for each day in
the week. I'm Saturday. When Christmas Day falls on a Saturday,
as it does this year, I have to attend to it. Now every leap year
one of us has to do double duty, and as next year is a leap year
I am told off for the extra day's work; but there is a chance for
any of us to get out of this extra work, thus,"&mdash;he went on
as though quoting from some rule or regulation,&mdash;"If a
Spirit when in the execution of its duty, can find a place upon
earth inhabited by Christian, or supposedly Christian people,
where no Christmas Literature is to be found upon Christmas Day,
he shall be able to claim exemption from extra duty on leap-year,
and the Spirit following him shall do his work."</p>

<p>"Spend your Christmas here," I cried, starting from the
hammock. "Search the house from garret to basement (it was only a
two-roomed hut), and see if you can find a Christmas magazine or
paper."</p>

<p>"That Christmas story," the Spirit sternly replied, "That
Christmas story, which shall never see the light, by its mere
presence in your idiotic skull has spoilt my chance of a holiday,
and I wanted to put Sunday into it"&mdash;the long faced
sanctimonious hypocrite. "But I will be revenged, revenged!"</p>

<p>"Spirit," I cried, casting myself at its feet and clutching
its robe, "have mercy; I am not strong-nerved. I could not bear
to be transported to regions of ice and snow, and see poor people
kind and generous to one another, and pretty girls playing at
blindman's-buff, and all the many signs you would show
me&mdash;have mercy!"</p>

<p>"Can you ask it knowing that during the whole of the past year
I have wandered to and fro seeking for a place wherein to rest on
this twenty fifth day of December? I marked this spot, noted the
dense stolidity, not to say stupidity, visible in your face, and
I said here is a place where I shall be safe; nicely situated in
a warm comfortable climate, mails always a month late; here I am
secure for my holiday. This morning I took a turn through Europe,
Asia, Africa, and America, just to see that everything was going
on all right, come here to finish my day quietly and peace fully,
in the virtuous frame of mind that a Spirit feels in who has done
his duty, and I find, what! That you&mdash;a being than whom a
generation of apes could not produce a greater fool&mdash;have
dared to compose a Christmas Story; that you have committed two
pages of it to paper, and it is even now lying there in your
bedroom. Can you deny it?"</p>

<p>I could only bow my head in guilty assent.</p>

<p>"But vengeance can still be mine&mdash;yes, Vengeance!
Vengeance!! Vengeance!!!" Here his voice rose to such a shriek
that I expected to see the stockman and cook come rushing in to
see what was up; but no help came to me, and he raged on.</p>

<p>"I will read to you, commencing with your own wretched two
pages, all the Christmas literature that has been published in
the world this season!" Uttering this awful sentence he leaned
back in the chair, and glared furiously at me.</p>

<p>"Mercy, mercy," I said faintly.</p>

<p>"No mercy, I know it not; I reckon it will just comfortably
occupy us until the end of next year to get through it all."</p>

<p>"Spirit!" I cried, "I have sinned, but I repent; I will be a
new man, Christmas shall be to me a season of mourning and
desolation; spare me." Its only answer was to open its book and
commence reading.</p>

<p>As though its first word was a blow, I fell back spell-bound
and motionless, and there I lay whilst the Genius began to read
my now detested production of two pages. First he read it in an
ordinary colloquial tone, then he gabbled it over, next he sung
it, then he tried to chant it. Then he read it in a facetious
manner, stopping to laugh every now and then; then he read it in
a dismal manner, pretending to cry; then he tried to make blank
verse of it, and I tried to stop my ears, but all in vain; over
and over again he read the horrid sentences I knew so well, until
at last he seemed out of breath, and stopped.</p>

<p>"How do you like it," he said, "will you ever do it
again?"</p>

<p>"Never, never," I groaned. He chuckled, and turning again to
his book, the pages of which produced anything he liked without
his having to turn over the leaves, he inflicted the following
story upon me:&mdash;</p>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

<p class="first">
CALM in the serene solemnity of their solitude; grand in the
outstretched vastness of their extent, and golden in the
Pactolean wealth of their beauty, lie the sands of Plimlivon. But
what huge, gloomy object is that, the rugged outlines of which
mar the tranquil beauty of their level expanse? Like the
fossilised form of some gigantic inhabitant of a world long
forgotten, or like a Brobdignagian bandbox labelled, "This side
up, with care," stands a mighty isolated rock, and casts upon the
otherwise unflecked extent of stainless sand around it, a shadow,
weird, gloomy, and mysterious. Why does that rock&mdash;that
grim, portentous sentinel, challenging the gladsome sunlight,
with its ominous "<i>Qui vive</i>," stand there and throw its
gruesome shade over sand-grain and pebble that would else be
revelling in the glorious radiance of day? Say, why does the
shadow of some awful secret crime fall across the otherwise
unblotted course of a fair, fresh life, and turn the rich colors
of the flowers of life into the sombre hues and tints of death? I
know not, gentle reader, but that rock stands there because I
intend to use it in the third and last chapter.</p>

<h3>1. &mdash; THE SECRET</h3>

<p class="first">"MY daughter," said the Marquis of Marborough.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father," replied the Lady Ermetta, who was of a most
dutiful disposition, and when she did not say 'No said 'Yes' with
undeviating regularity.</p>

<p>"The hour has now arrived when I feel it incumbent on me to
reveal to you the secret&mdash;the secret upon which hinges your
future welfare and happiness, and is also the central point of
interest in this story in which we are two of the principal
characters. Therefore, arm yourself with fortitude, and prepare
to hear it as becomes a heroine."</p>

<p>"Very well, my father," returned the dutiful girl, "but will
you kindly tell me exactly what to do."</p>

<p>"Clasp your hands convulsively, lean forwards attentively, and
with an expression of anxious horror on your beautiful features,
exclaim, 'Speak, speak, my father; I can bear the worst!'"</p>

<p>The Lady Ermetta followed his directions to the eighth part of
an affygraffy.</p>

<p>"You know, my child, that in the third and last chapter you
are to be married, as becomes a heroine; and you also know that
Baron Gadzooks is the bridegroom elect. But you do not know that
a dark secret hangs over his birth, a secret which I am now about
to reveal, therefore listen attentively."</p>

<p>"I am all ears," said the lovely girl.</p>

<p>"My dearest, that is a most irrational remark; now, really,
how can you be all ears?"</p>

<p>The Lady Ermetta blushed to the tips of the articles in
question, and muttered something that sounded like a request for
her father to go and put his boots on.</p>

<p>"Silence, Ermetta!" said her father sternly, "such conduct is
unbecoming in the heroine of a novel. Now, listen to me&mdash;The
Baron was changed at birth."</p>

<p>"Then Baron Gadzooks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is somebody else."</p>

<p>"And somebody else?"</p>

<p>"Is the Baron. You now comprehend the situation."</p>

<p>"Not altogether, my father, you have neglected to inform me
who somebody else is."</p>

<p>"That, my dear child, is a question that even the author could
not answer."</p>

<p>"Then supposing that I marry the Baron, I in fact marry
'somebody else,' and as you say that 'somebody else' is the
Baron, why of course my husband will be the Baron."</p>

<p>"How the deuce is that?" said the Marquis; "let's see. If you
marry the Baron&mdash;but you can't marry the Baron, because he's
not the Baron&mdash;he was changed at birth."</p>

<p>"He's somebody else."</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly."</p>

<p>"Then, as he is not the Baron, somebody else is the
Baron."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Then, again, if I marry Gadzooks, I marry 'somebody else,'
and somebody else, you say, papa, is the Baron," said the Lady
Ermetta, triumphantly. "Come now," she added rather maliciously,
"I think you are a little irrational now."</p>

<p>"Really Ermetta, you will look at the matter from only one
point of view; don't you see that he's not the right somebody
else. There are any amount of somebodies else; but let me tell
you all about it. This important secret came out in a
conversation that was overheard to pass between two servants. One
was the nurse of the then infant Gadzooks, the other was a fellow
servant. The nurse was heard to make the following remark about
her youthful charge:&mdash;'The blessed dear was a layin' in my
arms as quiet as a lamb, and smiling like a cherrup, when he
changed all of a sudden, and has been that cross and frakshus
ever since that I ain't had a minnit's peace with him.' The
person who overheard this startling disclosure was a devoted
friend of the family; he acted with decision and promptitude. The
servants were first got rid of&mdash;one was strangled, the other
hung. He then took the secret, hushed it into a sound sleep,
wrapped it carefully in tissue paper, and put it into a box."</p>

<p>"Then where is the danger to come from?"</p>

<p>"Here lies the danger. When that devoted friend put the secret
into the box he made a fatal mistake&mdash;he put it into the
wrong box, and the secret might awake and find itself."</p>

<p>"In the wrong box! How truly awful."</p>

<p>"It is indeed; it might awake at the very moment of your
marriage, and forbid the ceremony to proceed. There's no knowing
to what lengths a secret that's been kept asleep, in the wrong
box for many years might proceed when once awakened."</p>

<p>The Lady Ermetta sobbed deeply. "I can never give up
Gadzooks," she said, "I have never seen him, for he has not been
introduced personally into this story yet, but I feel that he has
my poor heart."</p>

<p>"Restrain your feelings, my child; picture to yourself what
would be the result if the secret should awake after your
marriage, and announce to an astonished world that you had
married somebody else; why you might almost be tried for
bigamy."</p>

<p>"Have you the secret, my lord?"</p>

<p>"I have; the two boxes are in my study, but calm your
agitation, for you know that Squire Hardpuller will soon be here,
and should you bring yourself to think of giving up Gadzooks,
why, he is rich, and I do not object to the idea of having him
for a son-in-law." So saying, the Marquis left Ermetta to her
tears and lamentations.</p>

<h3>2.&mdash; THE SECRET DIES</h3>

<p class="first">
NOW that she was alone, Lady Ermetta gave full vent to her
grief. "I can never give him up," she murmured, between her
convulsive sobs; "I feel that he is entwined around the very
tendrils of my existence. We were to have been married in the
third chapter, and now&mdash;this is the second, and we are to be
separated. And what separates us? A secret! A secret that sleeps.
Sleeps, why should it awake, why should it not die:" and uttering
these last words in the strange hissing tone used by people who
have determined on perpetrating some crime, Ermetta raised her
head and stared into vacancy, with a cold hard look stealing over
her sweet face.</p>

<p>The tears soon ceased to flow, her hands clenched themselves
tightly, and she who might but just now have stood for a statue
of the weeping daughter of Tantalus, was transformed into Lady
Macbeth, demanding the daggers.</p>

<p>Muttering sternly, "It shall be so," she left the apartment
with a step befitting a representative of that strong-minded
woman.</p>

<p>Let us watch her as she enters her father's study, where the
light falls but dimly through the deep-set windows, as though
winking at the deed about to be done. Watch her as she kneels
before two quaintly carved ebony boxes, and applies her ear to
the keyhole of each in turn. Watch her as the look of
gratification steals over her face on detecting, in one, a low
but perfectly distinct and regular respiration, the ghost of a
feeble snore. Watch her as she applies the key to the lock, lifts
the lid, and takes out the secret&mdash;takes it out gently and
carefully, with the tender touch of a woman, so as not to disturb
the slumber that has lasted now so long. Watch her, the guilty
thing, as she starts at hearing the sound of voices in the hall,
and, concealing the secret in her pocket, passes from the room to
hasten to receive her expected visitor. As yet the deed is not
done. As yet she can gaze out of those clear blue eyes with a
soul unstained by actual murder. But how long will her innocence
last; even now as she stands by the window in the morning room
where she intends to receive her would-be suitor, the weird, wild
look that must have been ever on the faces of the Di Medici and
Brinvilliers is visible. She has deposited the secret (still
asleep) on a chair, and she abides her time.</p>

<p>He comes. The door opens, and Squire Hardpuller is announced.
She greets him with a winning smile that makes his heart bound
again; poor man, he little thinks that she is bent upon making
him accessory to her deed of death. Skillfully she backs him on
to the chair of doom. Blandly she bids him be seated. Cordially
she welcomes him. Will he look behind him? Will he apologise, and
remove the innocent secret slumbering upon the seat of the chair?
No, Ermetta, your eyes have him spell bound. What man could look
away when you smilingly desired him to take a seat? You
have&mdash;alas! for beauty, for youth, for guileless innocence,
and sweet simplicity&mdash;you have made a murderer of him. He is
a heavy man, and he sits down on the secret. It is done, and
fiends may chuckle ha! ha! Now to keep him there.</p>

<p>Squire Hardpuller was a sporting character; he had been
introduced into a great many novels, and was always looked upon
as a great bore by the other characters, on account of his
endless stories of horses, dogs, runs, and other sporting
anecdotes. In the present case nobody could have answered
Ermetta's purpose better; once fairly started upon his favorite
and only topics, he prosed on contentedly for over two hours;
then, blushing to find that his visit had trespassed on her time
to such a length, he rose and made his adieux. She beamed on him
to the last with her siren-like smile, and then, when he had
gone, the re-action set in, and she who had listened unmoved for
two mortal hours to a lot of sporting anecdotes, quailed before a
dead secret. But such is human nature. She went to the chair in
which he had sat; she lifted up the tissue paper containing the
secret; with one white hand she held it to her ear, and with the
other held her breath.</p>

<p>Not a sound, not the faintest suspicion of sound was to be
heard. For nearly ten minutes did that high-bred resolute girl
strain every nerve tighter than wire in a sheep-fence, but all
was still. The secret, then, was dead. For a moment the rush of
feeling overpowered her, then curiosity came to her aid; she
would open the paper and see the secret. She had never seen a
secret; she had often heard one. Nay, she had read a book called
the "<i>Dead Secret</i>;" now she held one in her hand, she would
see it.</p>

<p>She was about to unfold the covering of tissue paper, when a
shadow fell across her, and somebody knocked at the window. She
looked up startled. The car of a balloon was dangling in front of
the glass, and seated in it was her father. She went to the
window and opened it.</p>

<p>"Come, my child," he said, "the third chapter is at hand, and
we must be at the appointed place. Step in." Putting her hand on
the sill, Ermetta sprang lightly into the car of the balloon,
which immediately commenced to ascend. She at once communicated
the important event that had just taken place to her father, and
carrying them with it the balloon soon became a mere speck in the
blue regions of the infinite.</p>

<p>But a close observer, one of unequaled vision, might have
detected a small minute object come fluttering down from the
empyreal vastness. Down it descended, gyrating hither and
thither, the sport of every wandering zephyr. They tossed it
mockingly about, played with it, then let it fall lower and
lower, until the broad bosom of the pitying earth received and
sheltered it. It was the corpse of the poor murdered secret. And
the shadow of the rock, on the sands of Plimlivon, is darker, and
deeper than ever.</p>

<h3>3. &mdash; BARON GADZOOKS</h3>

<p class="first">
BARON GADZOOKS was walking up and down on the sands of
Plimlivon. He looked out to sea, and tapped his teeth with the
top of his pencil; in his hand he held a note-book. He was
composing a poem. Presently he commenced to read it over.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Exsuffolating memory, get thee hence,<br>

Nor seek to melodise the scathful past;<br>

When rampant Ruin, drunk at my expense,<br>

Rose, and the empty bottle at me cast.</p>

<br>

<p>"That's rather good," he said, thoughtfully; "the simile in
the last line particularly, the empty bottle, stands for the
dregs of life."</p>

<p>That rounded throat, that wealth of tumbled hair: That mouth
so rose-like, kissable, and tender, She'd glue to mine, as if she
didn't care If suffocation should ensue and end her.</p>

<p>"Hem! that ought to fetch her," he went on; "quite in the
modern style; now for some thing hot and strong."</p>

<p>Must I forget all these; if so, then let me Be chained within
a sea of fire volcanic.</p>

<p>"What will rhyme with 'let me?' Let's see. Wet me, pet me, bet
me, get me, net me;" and the Baron cast his eyes upwards, for
inspiration, and caught sight of a speck in the canopy of heaven
overhead that made him shout "Ball-o-o-n!" Then suddenly
remembering that he was one of the principal characters in a
novel, and as such bound to act with propriety, he blushed, sat
down, and commenced to pick his teeth with one of his gilt spurs.
On second thought, however, he started up again, frowned
fiercely, and in deep tragedy tones said:&mdash;"Ha! ha! they
come." Then he picked up a telescope that had been left behind by
a party of excursionists, because they knew that it would be
wanted for my plot, and, applying it to his eye, gazed at the
rapidly increasing speck.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he muttered, "I see her, there&mdash;now she winks;
now&mdash;yes, she's about to blow her nose. Angelic being! But
hold! What's this?"</p>

<p>The noise of horses galloping at top speed had struck upon his
listening ear. Nearer they came, and two horsemen appeared
tearing along the level sand. And hark! the beat of paddles. Over
the surface of the hitherto tenantless deep glided a mighty
steamer, with crowded decks, the captain standing on the bridge,
and shouting, "Full speed ahead! full speed astern!" alternately.
A shrill whistle drew the Baron's attention again inland. A
traction engine, dragging a long string of carriages, appeared,
full of characters out of all sorts of novels, who had got in for
the sake of a ride. Amazement held the Baron dumb, so he said
nothing.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer everything came, everybody cheering and
waving another man's hat. At once the occupants of the balloon
stepped upon <i>terra firma</i>; the two horsemen, one being
Squire Hardpuller, alighted from their panting steeds; the train
disgorged its occupants, and the people from the steamer sprang
into the sea and waded on shore.</p>

<p>They all approached and surrounded the Baron; they waited for
him to speak, but he was silent.</p>

<p>"Read the will," said a tall man who looked like a lawyer.</p>

<p>"I have no will," said the Baron, "or I should not be
here."</p>

<p>"Then reveal the secret," said another.</p>

<p>"Unfold the plot," exclaimed a third.</p>

<p>"Open the red box," said a fourth.</p>

<p>"Produce the real heir," said a fifth.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my children," said a sixth.</p>

<p>"Last dying speech and confession," said a seventh.</p>

<p>Then spake the Lady Ermetta: "Baron, papa has consented; the
Bishop is ready, and here are the witnesses."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the witnesses!" shouted everybody.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said the astounded Baron, "I know now what you
mean. I was only introduced in this chapter; how the deuce am I
to know what's been done in the other two chapters?"</p>

<p>"He jibs!" said the Lady Ermetta, "and I have sinned in vain."
She would have fainted, but nobody seemed inclined to catch her,
so she didn't.</p>

<p>The Marquis then advanced, and in his usual dignified tone
said, "Are there any bad characters present?"</p>

<p>Nobody was fool enough to answer yes.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Marquis, turning to the Baron, "I am afraid
that you must be the bad character of this story, and if so,
Poetical Justice demands that you must be punished."</p>

<p>"This is hard," said the Baron, whose high bred composure did
not desert him under these trying circumstances. "I came out here
simply because I was informed that I was wanted for the proper
completion of the plot, and now I am to be made a scapegoat
of."</p>

<p>"There is some show of reason in what you say," said the
Marquis; "so one more chance shall be given you."</p>

<p>"Are there any bad characters present?" he again asked in a
louder voice. As before, nobody was fool enough to answer
yea.</p>

<p>"If there are any bad characters present," he went on, "let
them step forward and be hung instead of this innocent
nobleman."</p>

<p>At these awful words three bad characters, who had been hiding
behind the big rock, waiting for a chance to commit a murder, or
some thing of that sort, tried to sneak away unseen.</p>

<p>Squire Hardpuller, who had been anxiously looking out for an
opportunity to cry tally-ho! and thereby identify himself as a
sporting character, saw them, and immediately cried, "Stole away!
yoicks! yoicks! away!"</p>

<p>With one consent the whole assemblage joined in the cry, and
rushed in pursuit, with the exception of the Marquis and his
daughter.</p>

<p>The Lady Ermetta had big feet and thick ankles, which she was
frightened of showing if she ran, and the Marquis thought it
beneath his dignity to go out of a walk.</p>

<p>"Ermetta," said the Marquis gravely; "we are flummoxed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they'll come back," said Ermetta.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said the Marquis, looking after the fast
vanishing multitude. He was deceived, however. Nerved by despair,
the three bad characters ran well, and now doubled back and came
once more to the isolated rock on the sands.</p>

<p>Instantly new life seemed to enter into Ermetta; she whispered
something to her father, who shook his head, and said, "too
late," but suffered his daughter to lead him behind the rock.</p>

<p>Breathing heavily&mdash;with their pursuers, headed by
Hardpuller and Gadzooks, close upon their heels&mdash;the three
bad characters approached;&mdash;they passed and made for the
sea. As Gadzooks, in hot haste, pressed after them, running close
by the fatal rock, a foot clad in a French kid boot, and a very
substantial white-stockinged ankle, was thrust forth from behind
it, right in front of him; he tripped, he fell; and the next
moment the Marquis was holding him down.</p>

<p>"Poetical Justice!" he cried. "Poetical Justice!" echoed
Ermetta, who limped a little, for the Baron in falling had
inadvertently kicked her on the shin, and she didn't like to rub
it before so many people.</p>

<p>Everybody halted, glad of a spell, and the bad characters swam
out to sea.</p>

<p>"Where's the Bishop?" said the Marquis.</p>

<p>"Here," cried his lordship, coming forward hot and perspiring.
"Look sharp, or the end of the chapter will be here," said the
Marquis. Gadzooks was dragged to his feet, and held firmly, in
spite of his struggles and protestations.</p>

<p>"Quick, or we shall be too late," reiterated the Marquis.</p>

<p>"Never mind, papa, we have got him fast, and I can be married
in the Epilogue."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my child, epilogues are only to tell the reader
what he knows already."</p>

<p>The Bishop gabbled over the service&mdash;
"keep-thee-only-unto-her-as-long-as-ye-both-shall-live?"</p>

<p>"I will!" yelled everybody, drowning the voice of the wretched
Gadzooks, who said, "I won't."</p>

<p>Away went the Bishop again, etc., etc.</p>

<p>"I will!" said Ermetta; and she meant it</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" said the Marquis; "she's off my hands!"</p>

<p><br>
YEARS have passed, and the rising tide has washed away the
footsteps that were imprinted that morning on the sands of
Plimlivon. But that lonely rock still holds its steadfast watch,
and the shadow it casts is deeper and darker than ever. But the
shadow on the heart of the stricken Gadzooks is deeper and darker
still.</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>

<p class="first">
NOW, during the reading of the latter portion of the foregoing
story, a gleam of hope had shot across my brain. As soon,
therefore, as the Spirit had finished, I proceeded to put it into
practice.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that!" said the Spirit.</p>

<p>"I like it immensely," I replied; "really you can't think what
a jolly year I anticipate; it will be all beer and skittles."</p>

<p>The Spirit, I thought, looked slightly crestfallen.</p>

<p>"You've no idea," I went on, "how dull it is up here; and now
to have you to read these charming little stories to
me&mdash;really, old fellow, it will be delightful."</p>

<p>"Don't be so sure of that," he answered. But I fancied that he
seemed staggered.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, opening his book again; "for the next, one of
the real old sort&mdash;'How the King got his own again.'"</p>

<p>"'Twas Christmas Eve, and a bitter cold one to boot. What of
that? It but made the crackling log fire seem the warmer and
snugger. 'Be-shrew me!' said mine host of the Holly Bush, as he
stood with his back to it, warming his portly calves; 'but if
sad-colored garments and cropped heads are to be the fashion of
the day, we shall scarce know Merry England.'"</p>

<p>He had got thus far before I could well stop him; then I
interrupted him as blandly and politely as I could, "Excuse me;
one moment. That promises to be a most interesting tale, but you
will be tired and hoarse if you go on reading without pause. Now
just to give you a spell I'll sing you a song."</p>

<p>"A what!" he said.</p>

<p>"A song&mdash;a carol. A Christmas carol."</p>

<p>"You daren't," he said; but the blow had gone home I could
see.</p>

<p>"No trouble at all, my dear fellow, just the reverse, and it's
one of my own composing too," I added boldly, for I thought that
I could see victory ahead. I have no more voice than an alligator
with a cold in its head, and scarcely know one tune from another,
but without more ado I struck up:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Come, your hands entwine, for this toast is mine,<br>

A health to Christmas bold.<br>

Round his head the leaves of the holly shine,<br>

In his arms he does earth enfold.</p>

<br>

<p>"Patience! Grant me patience," muttered the Spirit; but he
seemed to clench his teeth firmly, as if with a determination to
sit it out. I went on, and hurled the next verse at him like a
boomerang:&mdash;</p>

<p>When over the ground he spreads around The snow that he so
does love, The robin comes out, and he looks about&mdash;</p>

<p>With one wild yell of anguish that made every sheet of iron in
the roof ring like a bullock bell, the Spirit of Christmas
started from the chair.</p>

<p>"Man! man! You have conquered. I forego my revenge. That robin
is too much for me. Live unharmed by me; but," and here his voice
softened into a tone of beseeching pathos, "as you have some
charity in your disposition, as you may stand in need of
consideration and forbearance yourself some day, do not add to
the heavy woes of a tortured Spirit by casting your additional
stone. Do not ever again attempt to write a Christmas story."</p>

<p>I was deeply touched, there was such a look of heartfelt
anguish on his face.</p>

<p>"You promise?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then, we part friends; but, ah! that robin," and, waving me a
parting salute, he stepped out into the glaring sunshine, and
passed away.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>03. &mdash; THE SHADOW OF A SHADOW</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 21 September 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
THE moon shone brightly through the many chinks of the old
hut, in the walls of which were several gaps caused by the slabs
having fallen down. Two travellers who were camped on the hard
earthen floor for the night were suddenly aroused by a wailing
sound that seemed to pass by their resting place like the sigh of
a breeze.</p>

<p>Both raised themselves on their elbows and listened. The wail
came round once more, and as it swept by a passing gloom seemed
to glide through the hut, as though the moon's light had been
eclipsed for one brief instant...</p>

<p>The men were silent. Rising with one accord, they went to one
of the gaps and looked out, for the sound was approaching once
more. It came, it passed, and for an instant there was again a
shade of gloom, and both men afterwards swore positively to
seeing a plainly-defined shadow cross the broad path of
moonlight. Not a shadowless man, but a shadow without the
necessary substance to cast it.</p>

<p>The wail died down in the distance, and the men broke their
silence.</p>

<p>'Rum sort o' thing, Jim. See that shadder?'</p>

<p>'My oath I did. And did yer hear what the thing cried
out?'</p>

<p>'Sounded to me as if it was calling out, "Blind, blind."'</p>

<p>'Just what I took it to be.'</p>

<p>'Blame these old huts,' said the first speaker, as they
returned to their blankets. 'A fellow never knows what he's going
to get. If they're not chockful of fleas, why, it's ghosts as
come moanin' around.'</p>

<p>When the men reached the next township, some thirty odd miles
away, they told their tale. They were two fencers who had just
finished a contract and were well known in the district as
steady, decent men, not by any means given to romancing.</p>

<p>The story seized on the superstitious feelings of the
townsmen, of which every man has a more or less sized share, the
oldest inhabitant failing to recall any tragic story connected
with the old hut and several excursions were made to test the
truth of it by daring spook-hunters. They all, with one
exception, came back unsuccessful, the exception being a party of
three, who, having loaded themselves up inside and out with
whisky, returned with a richly-embroidered yarn of ghosts,
devils, imps, and hobgoblins, sufficient to satisfy the yearnings
of the wildest imagination.</p>

<p>In due time the story was forgotten, save by one man, who,
having a theory of his own, had carefully noted the date of the
vision of the shadow, and on the following year departed without
beat of drum one morning of that date.</p>

<p>Although the moon's age was slightly different, it was old
enough to give a good light, and the night was clear and still,
and the inquirer after the supernatural slept restlessly, as a
man would do who had exchanged a comfortable bed for a blanket on
a hard floor. He was awakened by footsteps, not by the mysterious
sounds heard by the former temporary occupants. A man's figure
appeared at the doorless aperture, peered in, then entered.</p>

<p>'Who's that?' demanded the first tenant.</p>

<p>'Hell!' replied a voice, somewhat cracked and shaky. 'Who's
that yourself? I'm not frightened of you, darn you.'</p>

<p>The ghost-seeker struck a match, and saw before him an old
swagman, with a white, tobacco-stained beard, having the usual
swag over one shoulder. He blinked at the sudden flare of light,
then remarked:</p>

<p>'Dossing here, old man? What brought you out here? Don't look
as though you were in the bluey line.'</p>

<p>'No; I came here to find out if this hut's haunted as they say
it is.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that blessed yarn got in the papers, and as I was coming
around this way, I thought I'd just go out of my road a bit to
have a look myself; so I'll keep you company.'</p>

<p>And he threw his swag on the ground. At that moment a wail of
downright agony, a cry of 'Blind! blind!' rang through the forest
without, startling both the men in the hut.</p>

<p>On it came, and with it the gruesome darkening of the
moonlight. The ghost-seeker had not recovered himself
sufficiently to look out for the moving shadow the others averred
they had seen; but on the second approach of the ghostly voice,
now wailing loudly, as though knowing that there were listeners
to shriek its torments to, he went to the open door and stepped
out. There was no doubt of it&mdash;a shadow did cross the open
space in front of the old hut. A shadow, it seemed to the
watcher's excited fancy, like that of a man, stumbling along,
holding both hands to his eyes.</p>

<p>He waited for the third repetition, and just as the weird
shadow became visible he felt himself thrust on one side, and the
old sundowner pushed past him, saying, 'He's come for me. I must
go after him, and see what came of him.'</p>

<p>He went on and followed the invisible presence, and the
ghost-seeker felt himself constrained to follow too and see the
end. On through the silent forest they went, the viewless leader,
the muttering old man, and the entranced spectator. On, on, a
zig-zag course they kept, until at last they stopped.</p>

<p>The old man looked about still talking to himself, saying:</p>

<p>'He must'a bin about here, must'a bin here as he died.'</p>

<p>The supernatural voice had ceased, and presently the old man
squatted down on the ground, with his back against a tree, and
the other stooped over him and urged him to get up and
return.</p>

<p>'I'm a-going to stop here,' he replied. 'Come daylight, p'raps
I'll find him.' This was all that could be got out of him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the other asked, 'What do you know about this?'</p>

<p>'Know about it? Why, I knows all about it. Just you listen and
I'll tell yon. You can't see in the dark, but I'm a boko'
(one-eyed) 'and it was Bill Simmons as made me so. It was nigh
upon thirty years ago, and I could make good wages anywhere, and
one night we was having a bit of a jamboree, and Bill was there,
and he was one of the nastiest-tempered fellows in his drink as
ever you came across. Bill got on to me, and presently he got my
monkey up, and I gives him the lie straight out.</p>

<p>'"Say that again," he shouts; "call me a blooming liar again,
and I'll split y'r skull open."</p>

<p>'Of course, I ups and calls him no end of a thundering liar,
and what does the cur do but let drive at me with one of them
big, heavy tumblers. It caught me fair in the eye, and smashed
all to bits, and a piece of it cut right into my eyeball.</p>

<p>'The other fellows bandaged me up, and took me to the doctor,
and he said I must go to the hospital; and they took me there.
Some of 'em went for Bill, but he never seemed sorry; said it
served me jolly well right for calling such names, and he'd never
given any provocation, and paid out a lot of slack of that kind.
I had to stop weeks in the hospital, and while I was there he
cleared out of the district: and you bet he didn't give any
address where to find him. When I came out, t'other eye was a bit
bandy&mdash;doctor says as how it was for sympathy. Queer sort of
sympathy, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>'Well, all my bad luck set in then. First of all, a young
woman as was going to marry me went back on me&mdash;says as how
she never could abide a man with one eye; didn't seem natural
like. Beside, that dead eye of mine would give her the
jim-jams&mdash;always reminded her of an old horse her father had
who took fright at some washing hanging out and smashed the cart.
I told her as how I didn't intend to take fright at no washing;
but she wouldn't have it at any price, and I got left. A few of
the people who knew what a good workman I had been gave me an odd
job, but it was poor truck, and gradually I had to drift about,
travelling, getting anything I could do. So years went on, and I
never clapped my one eye on Bill Simmons, until one blazing hot
day I come to that old hut where you was camped. It was sound
enough then, and there was a shepherd there with a flock of
sheep. But there was no sheep about when I came there&mdash;only
a man with his eyes tied up lying groaning on the bunk, and my
colonial! if it wasn't Bill Simmons, blind as a bat with sandy
blight. I knowed him by his snarly voice, with which he cussed me
for letting the light in.</p>

<p>'"I say, damn you, whoever you are," he said, "will you go
into the head station and tell 'em as I'm stone blind with the
sandy, and 'the sheep's all over the country, and they must send
out and get 'em together 'fore the dogs get among 'em?"</p>

<p>'"No, I'm hanged if I will," says I. "My name's Jim Donnelly,
who you made a boko of years ago with chucking a glass at him,
and you just about ruined me, you cur."</p>

<p>'"Jim Donnelly, are you?" he said. "Yes, I am, and you can
just lie on your bunk and swear until somebody comes out from the
station. If you wasn't as you are I'd take it out of your
hide."</p>

<p>'He lay quiet for a bit; then he said: "I'm sorry, Jim
Donnelly," in a humble kind of voice, and I thought he was going
to cry small; but he burst out as savage as a meat-axe, "as I
didn't knock both of your cussed, squinting eyes out when I was
at it!"</p>

<p>'This got my hair off at once. "You'll repent those words,
Bill," I says.</p>

<p>'"I repent 'em! When I get right I'll follow you up and just
wallop the soul out of your carcass."</p>

<p>'Well, he kept on raving and abusing of me, and I got madder
and madder as I thought of all the years of my life wasted
through that wretch lying there blaspheming at me; but I kept
cool. I cooked myself a feed of the best in the hut. How he did
swear when he heard me opening his pickles and jam.</p>

<p>'When I'd finished, I says, 'Now, Bill Simmons, you want
bringing down off your perch a bit&mdash;a peg lower will suit
you,' so I went over to him and just took the bandage off his
eyes. What a scream he gave, just like the way that ghost
shrieked.</p>

<p>'"You've blinded me," he cried, putting his hands up to his
eyes; but there was a. devil in me, and I only laughed at him. I
took all the things out of the hut, as I thought he could find
and make fresh bandages of, and emptied all the water away; then
I went and sat down on the bundle and smoked his tobacco until
sundown.</p>

<p>"He'd stopped raving after a bit, and when it was dark I heard
him calling in a very pitiful voice 'Jim Donnelly! Jim! for the
Lord's sake bring me a little water to wash my eyes, the lids is
all glued together."</p>

<p>I would not answer him, though I felt sorry, so after a while
he fell to cursing me agin, and presently he got up and I heard
him groping his blind way out. He'd got his boots off, and was
feeling for the track to the waterhole with his naked feet. He
passed close to me, but I made never a move, although I was
beginning to think better of it, and making up my mind that I
would doctor his eyes up again and leave him.</p>

<p>'"Blast you, Jim Donnelly," he kept saying as he stumbled
along. 'May a blind shadder haunt you all your days.'</p>

<p>By and bye he gets off the track, and then he comes to grief
agin a stump, and gets so outrageous mad over this that he
muddled himself up together, and finally got on a sheep track and
started to follow that I calls out to I him as he's wrong, but he
was so busy swearing that he didn't hear me, so after letting him
go on a bit I started after him meaning to bring him back, but
being boko of one eye and not seeing well out of the other, I
come to grief myself over a stump, and bringing my head agin a
tree, and lay there stunned like for a bit. When I picked myself
up Bill Simmons was nowhere in sight and I never set eyes on him
again, no more did anybody else, although I looked high and low.
He must have lost himself altogether, and wandered in the blazing
sun next day till he died of thirst, and being without a hat.</p>

<p>'I heard of this yer yarn about, them fencer chaps seeing a
shadder at this hut as called out it was blind, so I thought I'd
just check up to see if Bill had been found; that's to say his
bones or whatever left of him. Now, as it's pretty well daylight,
we'll have a look round for 'em, they're dead sure to be about
here somewheres.'</p>

<p>The two looked for the bones of Bill without success, until
the sun got high, then the ghost seeker tried to induce Donnelly
to return to the hut, but without avail. The old fellow announced
his intention of staying there until he found Bill's bones or
died there.</p>

<p>When the ghost-seeker got back to the township, and told of
the success of his adventure he became a temporary hero, much to
the jealousy of the oldest identity, who now professed to have
remembered all about the mysterious disappearance of Bill
Simmons, and predicted that the dead body of Donnelly would be
found beside the bones of the lost man.</p>

<p>It wasn't, however, for when some curious people went out they
found neither the old sundowner nor the swag he had left in the
hut; nor has the wailing shadow ever been heard again, nor the
bones of the bad-tempered Bill Simmons found.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>04. &mdash; A GRUESOME SHIPMATE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 6 October 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
'WHAT do you make of it?' said the skipper, as he took his
glasses from his eyes, and turned to the chief mate, who had been
inspecting the object in sight through a telescope as big as a
small sized cannon. The chief mate, who had been resting his
weapon on a boat, straightened his back, and replied:</p>

<p>'An abandoned junk, I take it.'</p>

<p>'Maybe somebody dying on board. Won't be far out of our
course, at any rate, to go and see. Keep her for the junk, Mr.
Stewart, and call me when we are close to it.'</p>

<p>The sea was oily and calm; there was a nasty looking haze low
down on the horizon, and, although there were no clouds, there
was a constant distant rumble of thunder.</p>

<p>In about an hour the steamer was within hail of the derelict,
which turned out to be a Malay proa. No sign of life was visible,
and the captain looked uneasily round at the growing haze and the
apparently deserted proa.</p>

<p>Just then a figure was visible on the forward part of the
proa. It had a cap on, which, it waved.</p>

<p>'It's a blackfellow of some sort&mdash;a d&mdash;d ugly one,'
said the captain, lowering his glasses. 'Get the boat away, Mr.
Stewart, and board her;' then he added as an afterthought, 'Take
your revolver and a couple of rifles.'</p>

<p>The boat got away quickly, and pulled smartly to the proa. The
mate clambered on board, followed by the quartermaster and the
Chinese <i>Serang</i>.</p>

<p>The next instant the watching passengers and crew heard a cry
of alarm. What followed next they could not make out; but the end
was that the <i>Serang </i>seemed to be bundled overboard by a
strange figure in an American military service cap. Then there
was rapid firing on board, the <i>Serang</i> was fished out of
the water by the boat-keepers, and a dead silence ensued.</p>

<p>It was broken by sounds like the blows of an axe, and
presently the mate and quartermaster appeared, carrying an inert
figure between them, and passed it into the boat.</p>

<p>The steamer had meanwhile drifted nearer the derelict, and the
mate, making a trumpet of his hands, hailed, 'Shall I scuttle
her?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but be quick!' returned the captain.</p>

<p>The mate and quartermaster disappeared, but In a very short
time reappeared and hurried into the boat, which immediately
pulled off. The captain went to the gangway when the boat
approached, and the doctor came forward to receive the survivor
who turned out to be an emaciated Malay boy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the proa was settling slow, and as the crew were
hauling the boat up to the davits, a cry arose that she was
sinking. At that instant the figure with the cap appeared on the
wallowing proa. It waved the cap wildly, and then plunged
overboard and commenced to swim towards the steamer.</p>

<p>'Don't let it come on board,' shrieked the mate, 'we have seen
enough of its devilish work.'</p>

<p>Snatching up one of the rifles, which had not yet been
returned to the stand, he fired at the swimmer.</p>

<p>'What the devil is it?' demanded the captain.</p>

<p>'One of those wild men of Borneo. Those monster apes. It
murdered the crew of the proa.'</p>

<p>The being was now near the side, and several of the passengers
called to the captain to pick it up. For answer, he stepped
forward with the rifle, took deliberate aim, and fired. The thing
gave a human-like shriek, threw up one hand, and sank, its body
turning over with the wash of the screw, which had commenced to
revolve. The cap could be seen floating in the wake of the
steamer until it was lost to sight.</p>

<p>At the same time the proa disappeared.</p>

<p>There was silence on board for a few minutes, then the
captain, gave some quick, hurried orders, and before half an hour
had passed the typhoon had burst, and was howling and shrieking
at the steamer's heels.</p>

<p><br>
THE mate's story ran: They boarded the proa, and to their
horror found the dead bodies of the Malay crew, four in all,
lying on the deck. All appeared to have been strangled. The
bodies were decomposing, and the stench awful. While they were
examining the bodies, the ourang outan sprang amongst them, and,
seizing the <i>Serang</i>, threw him overboard, half killed by
its grip The mate and quarter-master then fired on the animal,
and the thing retreated wounded. They then heard a feeble
knocking down below, and on going down found the Malay boy they
had rescued, barricaded behind some cases and dunnage of one sort
or another.</p>

<p>The rest of the story the others knew. The typhoon had blown
itself out without injury to the steamer, before the Malay boy,
Ali Sadoo, was able to tell his story.</p>

<p>'The ourang-outang was being taken to the Rajah, or Sultan, of
one of the small islands of the archipelago. When taken on board
it was tame and quiet, and, in fact, in the Bornean village where
it was obtained he was noted for his good and quiet behavior. So
it was docile during a greater part of the voyage, and it was
allowed to roam about the proa as it liked; in fact, it did a lot
of work&mdash;it would lay on to a rope, or do anything of that
sort. Now they had on board several jars of native spirit they
were taking down as cargo. Three of the crew and Ali Sadoo were
good Mahomedans, who would not touch it, but the fourth was a
Manilaman&mdash;a Filipino&mdash;and he it was who brought the
American service cap on board.</p>

<p>He soon broached the cargo, and finding that none of the
others would join him, in a drunken fit be took the ourang-outang
down, and gave it some liquor. This went on for a day or two, and
suddenly, one evening, when the men were lounging on the deck,
and it was a dead calm, the ourang-outan appeared, mad with
drink.</p>

<p>In its arms it carried the mutilated body of the dead
Filipino. On its head it wore the American cap the man had worn.
It hurled the corpse amongst the affrighted, unarmed men, and
then commenced a hideous massacre which the boy did not witness,
for he crept below and barricaded himself in to the best of his
ability. There he remained until, half dying, he heard the shots
on deck, and managed to make his presence known.</p>

<p>While lying there, he heard the ourang-outan come down and
drink at the jars, and once it smashed one, in a fierce outburst
of rage.</p>

<p><br>
'AH!' said one of the passengers, when the steamer reached
Singapore, 'I can never forgive you, captain, for shooting that
highly intelligent animal. Think what an example he would have
been for a temperance lecturer to carry round with him. Think of
the interests of science and cold water.'</p>

<p>The captain laughed grimly.</p>

<p>'If I had thought of that I would have taken him aboard and
kept him chained up till I met a temperance lecturer who wanted a
frightful example. Would you have taken the risk?'</p>

<p>'On the whole,' said the passenger, 'I think he is best where
he is now. You didn't take any risks, and you were quite
right.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>05. &mdash; MATTHEWSON'S INVISIBLE PIG</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 13 August 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
'DID I ever tell about Matthewson's invisible pig? asked Jim
of me one day.</p>

<p>'No, is it worth hearing or not?'</p>

<p>'Well, that depends on whether you choose to believe it to be
a true story or only a yarn. I assure you that it's as true as
gospel; but there have been some people who have had the cheek to
say it's not true, Sammy Greenup amongst them&mdash;'</p>

<p><br>
NOT the Greenup who sold his farm because he believed the
world was coming to an end. But a brother of his, and the very
biggest-sized liar in the district; got a yarn he tells about a
knock-kneed duck, and swears that it's a fact. I'd be ashamed to
tell such a thing.</p>

<p>Matthewson had a prize sow, which he was very proud of, and
some say that he thought more of her than he did of his wife and
family. Anyway, he made an awful fuss about her. Well, she had a
fine litter of young pigs, and Matthewson went about as proud as
a dog with a new gilt tail, calculating what he'd make by these
pigs, and boring the soul out of everybody to come and look at
them.</p>

<p>I went, and a fine lot of young suckers they were, but
Matthewson needn't have made such a song about it; other people
had pigs as well as he. Well, we were looking at the piggies, and
Matthewson had just gone into a calculation as to what money he
would make out of them when I heard a little squeak behind
me.</p>

<p>I looked round, couldn't see anything, and thought I must have
made a mistake, and went on listening to Matthewson, who was just
buying a new farm with the pig money, when I heard a squeak
again.</p>

<p>I turned round sharp once more&mdash;nothing there.</p>

<p>'I wish you'd listen to me, Jim, instead of turning round and
starting in that loony kind of way,' says Matthewson. Just then
there was a little, grunt right at my heels, and it felt like
something sniffing at them. I turned round like a shot. Nothing
there again.</p>

<p>'At it again,' he says. 'You've been drinking, Jim Parkes, and
got the jumps.'</p>

<p>'You're an everlasting teetotaller,' I said. 'But there's
something grunting and squeaking about my heels; can't you hear
it?'</p>

<p>'No, I can't,' he said; 'and you put me out in my
calculations.'</p>

<p>I tried to listen steadily, but that grunting and squeaking
kept on, and I had to back kick once or twice.</p>

<p>'Jim,' he said, 'you tire me with your goings on. I've got a
nip or two inside; come in and get one if you want to steady your
nerves, but own up like a man.'</p>

<p>'Matthewson,' I replied, 'I won't refuse your offer, for
there's something going on I don't understand; but you know well
enough I'm not a bcozer.'</p>

<p>'No, Jim, and I'll admit it; but you're very jumpy for all
that.'</p>

<p>We went inside, and I had some whisky, and sat down and
listened quietly to Matthewson developing into a millionaire, but
all the time I was turning the occurrence over in my mind.</p>

<p>When we went outside again we had another look at the pigs,
and I listened, and presently heard a grunt and a squeal where
there was no pig at all to be seen. Then the truth flashed on
me.</p>

<p>'Matthewson,' I said, 'that old sow's a ventriloquist.'</p>

<p>'Jim Parkes,' he exclaimed, 'I won't allow anyone, not even
you, to call my prize sow names. She's no more a ventriloquist
than you are.'</p>

<p>'I didn't miscall your sow at all, but she's a ventriloquist
for all that. Ever since I've been here I've been hearing grunts
and squeals where it isn't natural for them to come from, so if
she isn't a ventriloquist, and doing it for a lark, what's
up?'</p>

<p>'Your nervous system is all upset, Jim. That's what's up.'</p>

<p>'My nerves are as good as ever, but you're as deaf as a post,
or you'd have heard the noises.'</p>

<p>Then Matthewson got downright mad, for he really was a little
deaf, but would never admit it, and didn't like it mentioned. We
got to words, and I went away.</p>

<p>Matthewson went about telling everybody how I was jealous of
his sow, and said she was a ventriloquist, out of pure spite and
envy. And the neighbors sympathised with him, and he got worse
than ever about his sow and her litter. By and bye, a nephew of
Matthewson's came up to recruit. He'd been an a bad spree, and
his people sent him up to his uncle's to get round.</p>

<p>Well, he used to go down and look at the pigs and compare
himself to the prodigal son, for he was in the repentant stage
and very shaky, and one day he heard the grunting at his heels
and couldn't see anything. So he ran, hard as he could lick, up
to the house, and had a fit.</p>

<p>Even this did not satisfy Matthewson that there was something
queer about his sow; but he packed the nephew home, and said he
wouldn't take charge of lunatics any more. However, the yarn got
about, and people began to poke fun at his old sow, and he laid
it all down to me. Said that everyone knew I was always blowing
about what I knew about ghosts, and if there was anything wrong
about the sow I must have bewitched her, and he'd have the law of
me and get heavy damages.</p>

<p>Seeing how things stood, I was rather surprised to see him
coming up to my place one day.</p>

<p>'Jim Parkes,' he said, 'you're not the one to bear malice; and
for what I may have said about you I ask your pardon. There is
something queer about those young pigs. It's not the sow; she's
as good as gold, and her character hasn't a stain upon it; it's
one of the young ones that's wrong.'</p>

<p>'What's up?' I asked.</p>

<p>'You thought the mother was a ventriloquist,' he went on, 'and
I admit now you had some cause for your belief; but it wasn't
her. Now come over and find out with me what it is, and beg her
pardon.'</p>

<p>Of course I went back with Matthewson to investigate. We had a
bit of a job. They were all comfortably asleep, but we roused
them up, and chivied them round a bit, for by this time they were
pretty strong, on their legs, and after a while I says to
Matthewson, 'How many grunters have you?'</p>

<p>'Eight, by rights.'</p>

<p>'There's nine; but one of 'em's invisible.'</p>

<p>Matthewson stared at me for a long time before he could take
it in, but when something ran between his legs with a squeal, and
he couldn't see it, he was satisfied.</p>

<p>'What shall I do?' says he. 'I've never done nothing to
deserve this.'</p>

<p>'Why, you everlasting fool,' I said, 'it's a rare piece of
luck. Why, an invisible pig's a rarity.'</p>

<p>'I suppose it is,' he replied, after thinking a bit. 'Anyhow,
I never heard of the breed before. What's it called?'</p>

<p>'You jolterhead! It's never been heard of before. You can take
the pig to any country in Europe, and get thousands for it.
People will pay to see him.'</p>

<p>'They will, will they, Jim? Pay to see an invisible pig that
nobody can see. How do you make that out?'</p>

<p>'Well, it was just a figure of speech. The pig's worth more
than all the others put together and the sow thrown in.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps she may have an invisible litter next time, and that
would mean something big. But I'd nave to keep the breed to
myself, or they'd get too common.'</p>

<p>Matthewson was always thinking of money&mdash;nothing else
seemed to interest him much.</p>

<p>'How am I to secure them?' he says. 'I can't ear-mark or brand
them. And everybody will claim them.'</p>

<p>He was getting quite silly over it, so I amused myself with
hunting the invisible animal about to make sure of his presence.
It was not long before the yarn was all over the place, and
people came from all parts to hear the pig grunt. This worried
the old sow considerably, but she had to put up with it, and
Matthewson got that conceited he could scarcely put his hat on.
He had a photograph taken of himself with the invisible pig on
his lap.</p>

<p>Of course, he hadn't any pig on his lap In reality, and nobody
never caught that pig, but it pleased people to think so, and the
photograph sold. Clergymen came, heaps of 'em. They all said it
was a wonderful manifestation of Divine Providence and a
testimony of the truth of the doctrines of their particular
church, and asked Matthewson for a subscription. But he never
gave them anything. Said they must excuse him because the
responsibility of the thing was wearing him to the grave, and he
didn't think he'd have enough money left to pay for his
funeral.</p>

<p>As that pig grew up he was a very devil for mischief. Mrs.
Matthewson and the girls said that life wasn't worth living. It
was nothing but shrieking and equalling all over the house, with
the invisible pig rooting unexpectedly round their ankles. They
couldn't keep him out anyhow, for when they'd shut all the doors
and congratulate themselves on being safe for a bit, they'd find
they'd shut the invisible pig in with them, instead of
outside.</p>

<p>Several learned and scientific men came down to inquire into
the matter, and whenever they met they came to high words. Most
of them refused to believe it, and said it was a clever piece of
jugglery and ventriloquism; but some wrote long articles on it,
and explained it to their satisfaction. A lady medium said that
it was a spirit called Major Mompus, whom she knew well, and she
would make him materialise himself for 50.</p>

<p>But Matthewson wouldn't allow it&mdash;said that it wouldn't
pay; the pig would only be an ordinary pig then. Other mediums
came, and they all said: it was a spirit of their acquaintance,
and wanted to know how Matthewson did it so well. But he wouldn't
tell them, for a very good reason, because he had nothing to
tell.</p>

<p>I puzzled my brains about it a good bit. I thought at times
that it must be some kind of ghost trick or other, and presently
I noticed that the pig always kept very quiet when I was up at
Matthewson's. I put this down to fancy, and got Mrs. Matthewson
to take notice for me whether he was more frisky when other,
people were about than when I was, and she did, and confirmed my
views on the subject.</p>

<p>It's some sprightly old ghost, I thought, having a game. And
when I saw that the old sow never noticed the invisible pig's
presence or absence I was sure that I was right.</p>

<p>I mentioned this fact to Matthewson, but he got quite cross
about it; and when I hinted that I'd undertake to expose the old
fraud of a ghost he burst out: 'Now look here, Jim Parkes, I'll
have none of your interfering. Who asked you to shove your oar
in? Is it your invisible pig or mine? Answer me that, now.'</p>

<p>I got riled, and replied, 'As for that, that invisible pig
don't belong to anybody. If he's yours, catch him.'</p>

<p>'I could catch him quick enough if I wanted to, and I'll
trouble you to let my property alone.'</p>

<p>'I don't know if it as your property. Anyway, that old sow's
not its mother.'</p>

<p>'Taking that old sow's character away again. I might have
known what you were after. I'll bet you the next litter she has
are all invisible. Come now.'</p>

<p>I laughed at him, but he annoyed me, all the same, and I
determined to have a try, in spite of Matthewson. But the pig
stuck close to the place, and I could never get a chance at him.
I saw that I'd been a fool to quarrel with Matthewson, so I
determined to make it up with him.</p>

<p>You may say that I had no business to interfere in the matter.
If Matthewson chose to have an invisible pig about his place,
surely it was his business. But you know how it is with me when
there's anything ghostly about&mdash;I must have my finger in the
pie.</p>

<p>So I laid my plans.</p>

<p>First I went to Matthewson and apologised for being so hot the
other day, and that I'd changed my opinion on the subject. I
remanded him that I first found out that he had an invisible pig.
I said I had thought of a way by which I could prove that it was
the old sow's pig, and not a common ghost; and that if I could do
that, why, his fortune was made.</p>

<p>Matthewson was touched at this, and we shook hands. We went up
to the pig-yard and leaned on the logs, looking at them.</p>

<p>'What's that strange grunter you have?' I said suddenly.</p>

<p>'There's no stranger there,' says Matthewson.</p>

<p>'Yes there is,' said I; 'a razor-backed, long-legged brute's
got in from somewhere.'</p>

<p>Matthewson looked, but couldn't see anything strange, and he
began to grow uneasy.</p>

<p>'You're kidding me,' said he; 'you're gammoning. I've no
long-legged, razor-backed animal.'</p>

<p>'By Jupiter, then, I can see the invisible pig at
last&mdash;and a mangy, brute it is!'</p>

<p>As I said this there was a squeal from the little pigs, and I
knew I was right, and that it was some old screw of a ghost up to
his larks.</p>

<p>Matthewson looked very downcast.</p>

<p>'If you can see him really, and he's such a mongrel, why, he
can't be the old sow's,' he said, dejectedly.</p>

<p>Matthewson wouldn't go back on his prize sow.</p>

<p>I put my leg over the logs, and went into the yard, pretending
I could see the pig all the time. Just then something ran between
my legs, and down I went in the dirty litter.</p>

<p>'What did you do that for?' said Matthewson.</p>

<p>'That darned pig disappeared again, and ran between my legs,'
I said, getting up, sulkily. But I wasn't sulky in reality, for I
felt that that pig knew who I was, and meant what he did.</p>

<p>Matthewson laughed like anything.</p>

<p>That settled it. A man who could laugh at his friend being
capsized in a pigyard was not deserving of consideration.
Matthewson might want to keep that invisible pig going, but
henceforth it was war to the knife between the pig and I. Still
the pig had the best of it, for I could only get near him with
the assistance of Matthewson, and he did not altogether trust
me.</p>

<p>'This makes things doubtful,' I said to him when I was once
more outside the pig-pen. 'We must keep quiet about it. If the
pig is really such a brute as the thing I saw, he couldn't be the
offspring of your well-bred sow, could he?'</p>

<p>'Seems not,' he said, 'but you won't say a word to
anybody.'</p>

<p>'Not a word. But if I were you, I'd sell that sow. You'd get a
big price for her, as the mother of invisible pigs.'</p>

<p>'I might, certainly; but, strictly speaking, I don't see much
market value in invisible pigs. You can't kill and eat them, and
what else are pigs good for?'</p>

<p>'That's the bow you and your brother had the dispute
over.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Poor Harry he used to have queer notions. Would have it
that sow was his, because he lent me the money to buy her, and I
didn't paid it back Before he died. Some people have queer ideas
about money matters.'</p>

<p>'They have,' I said.</p>

<p>Now not far from me was a lazy galoot of a fellow who had a
wife and a large family all lazier than himself. He kept pigs,
mostly in the house. They were bred like racers, and lived
principally on empty jam tins and broken crockery. I went down to
him and borrowed a young pig. Before daylight I had him in
Matthewson's pen.</p>

<p>Matthewson overslept himself that morning. He had been
dreaming of pig all night, when the redheaded man, who was
knockabout, rushed in and said that he had seen the invisible
pig, Matthewson was up like a shot, and ran to the pen.</p>

<p>There sure enough was the steeplechaser I'd put in there. I
managed to be about pretty early that morning, and Matthewson
seeing me in the paddock, coo-eed to me to come up. Up I went end
found Matthewson and his red-headed man gazing, struck dumb, at
the pig.</p>

<p>'He's a beauty!' I said.</p>

<p>Just as I spoke there was a row in the pen. The real invisible
pig seized the invisible impostor, and a curious fight
ensued.</p>

<p>The visible pig could feel the other, but he couldn't see him,
and though he fought and squealed and did his best, he got spots
knocked off him. The invisible pig had him by the ear, and was
dragging him round the yard, the others all singing out pen and
ink. It was the most curious sight you ever saw to see that pig
hauled along by nothing, protesting all the time.</p>

<p>There was a lump of a sapling lying by the fence, and picking
it up and judging just where the invisible pig must be, I landed
him one on the back that must have astonished him. He let go with
a loud squeal, and the other pig jumped the logs, capsized the
red-beaded man, who was standing with his mouth open, and fled
home.</p>

<p>'You've killed my pig, and by Jingo you'll pay for him.'</p>

<p>'Where's his dead body, anyhow?' I asked.</p>

<p>There were high words, and Matthewson and I quarrelled again
over the blessed pig.</p>

<p>That night I was woke up by a noise in 'my' room, grunting and
squealing, and enough row for forty pigs. I guessed it was the
invisible pig, and sang out to it.</p>

<p>'Who are you?'</p>

<p>'I'm Matthewson's brother,' came back a human voice.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you?'</p>

<p>'I was just paying off that brother of mine for cheating me
out of that sow, and what you wanted to interfere for I don't
know.'</p>

<p>'What did you upset me for?'</p>

<p>'You began It. You think too much of yourself, Jim Parkes. Who
are you after all?'</p>

<p>'I'm not invisible, at any rate.'</p>

<p>'Well, I am. I thought it would scare that brother of mine off
the place, and, Instead of that, the old fool's as proud as
anything about it. How can I get even with him?'</p>

<p>I thought a bit. I knew there had been sharp practice between
the brothers over that sow, but there seemed no sense in the
ghost of Harry playing the fool.</p>

<p>'What do you want to do?'</p>

<p>'I want him to sell that sow. It makes me rank sick to watch
him coddling her, and talking about her, add carrying on so. I
can't get my proper wast.'</p>

<p>'How did you suppose you could do it by coming back as an
invisible pig? Why did you not come in your own shape, and scare
the soul out of him till he sold the sow, and gave the money away
in charity?'</p>

<p>'I must give up this pig racket, I see.'</p>

<p>'Not yet; come and see me to-morrow night; I might think of
something.'</p>

<p>I went to sleep again, and the next day went over to
Matthewson's.</p>

<p>'Pig come back?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, but you've injured him severely, I can tell it by his
squeal. Sounds all out of tone. What sort of a game was it to
belt an invisible pig with a sapling?'</p>

<p>'Well, the beggar capsized me, didn't be?'</p>

<p>'Served you right for calling him names. But just listen to
that squeal&mdash;hasn't got half the music in it that it
had.'</p>

<p>I couldn't tell any difference in it; tout Matthewson thought
he could. However, it gave me an idea.</p>

<p>That night I told the ghost of Harry. Matthewson what to do,
and he gave me a sample of his powers.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards, Matthewson came down to me, and said
he, 'That there invisible pig's mighty queer. He's making the
most outrageous noises possible; and I can't see him or catch him
to find out what's the matter with him.'</p>

<p>I went back with Matthewson; and of all the rows you ever
heard that pig was making the most diabolical. It was like a mad
foghorn phasing a railway whistle. You couldn't get away from it
if you stuffed your ears full, and put your head in a Bucket of
water.</p>

<p>'He's got some sort of a fit now,' said Matthewson, in a
hollow tone of voice. 'Times he's not so bad; times he's
worse.'</p>

<p>Well, this went on till Matthewson got thin and haggard. He
couldn't sleep for listening to the moaning of the pig.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't mind if I could see him, and doctor him, but to
hear that animal suffering tortures, and not be able to physic
him. It's killing me, Jim.'</p>

<p>'Do you think me and the girls' like it any better than you
do?' put in Mrs. Matthewson, and I could see that Matthewson was
suffering.</p>

<p>'Better get rid of the sow; then the pig will go with her,' I
suggested.</p>

<p>He shook his head dismally, and I saw that if Harry kept it up
properly, he'd give in. Harry did keep it up. His groans and
cries were the terror of the neighborhood, and Matthewson used to
walk about bewailing the fact of not being able to doctor the
pig.</p>

<p>At last his wife would stand it no longer, and he tried to
sell the sow. But no one would buy her along with that horrible
fog-horn. At last a dealer came along, and as the ghost had the
sense to keep quiet, he managed to get rid of her for about half
her value. But it broke his heart, fairly broke his heart. And
when the dealer came by again, and said he'd had no trouble with
any noise, it was the last straw. He took to his bed.</p>

<p>But he never knew that it was the ghost of his dead brother
that drove him to an early grave. All through liking to get the
best of everybody, too. It's a bad failing for a man to have,
though permissible in horse-dealing.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>06. &mdash; FOUR JUNCTION CREEK</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 27 November 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
DIGGS was my partner for many years. Not a bad fellow, but apt
to grow peppery over trifling matters. I remember the first time
we were discussing buying the station, the question arose as to
what the name of the firm should be&mdash;Diggs and Feeling, or
Feeling and Diggs.</p>

<p>We both would be on equal terms financially, so we found if
very hard to decide, and nearly fell out over it. Diggs said I
was obstinate in the matter, and I thought him the same. At last
we determined to refer to Bagot&mdash;Bagot would be our neighbor
if we bought the station we were thinking of investing
in&mdash;so we did so.</p>

<p>Bagot put his considering cap on as we sat smoking on his
broad verandah and waiting for the oracle to speak. A long wait
it was, and we both followed Bagot's example of emptying our
glasses of rum and water twice, before he spoke. A bright idea
came into his head, for he was something like that unknown
character of Shakespeare's, the husband of Juliet's
nurse&mdash;'Ah! a merry man.' He laughed heartily, and said:</p>

<p>'I've got it.'</p>

<p>'Possibly,' I remarked, 'but we haven't.'</p>

<p>'Call the firm Feeling and Diggs, and make your station brand
D.F.'</p>

<p>'Why this combination?' said Diggs, after a pause. 'Well, the
initials of Diggs and Feeling, as the firm's signature, would
stand for d&mdash;d fools, but on the cattle they'd stand for
d&mdash;d fat.'</p>

<p>Diggs and I looked at each other; it seemed a way out of the
difficulty, and we accepted it on the spot, which mightily
pleased old Bagot. He told his version of the story all over the
district, and became the acknowledged wit in consequence. We
didn't mind. We bought the station, and I am happy to say got on
very well for some years, and the DF brand was very popular.</p>

<p>Then an episode I am about to relate broke up the peaceful
life we were leading, and finally led to breaking up the
partnership of Feeling and Diggs.</p>

<p>It was not the fault of either of us&mdash;simply an unhappy
conjunction of circumstances. The head station, when we took the
station over, was in a very inconvenient place for working the
run, and after some years, when the house and yard began to show
signs of decay, we determined to shift it to another site.</p>

<p>The site we chose was an old station site, much more favorable
in every way, and we wondered why it had ever been deserted. None
of the men about could tell us, not even old Bagot. But one night
a hoary old traveller came along, and from what he said in the
men's hut one of them came over to us in the morning, and
informed us that 'old Captain,' as the swagman was called, could
tell us all about the old homestead at Four Junction Creek.</p>

<p>So we called him over, and promised him a day's spell and some
tucker if he would tell us all he knew. He was a queer-looking
old fellow, with a white beard, badly stained with tobacco.</p>

<p>''Four Junction Creek was where old Smithfield&mdash;he who
took this place up first&mdash;was murdered by two of his
men.'</p>

<p>'Well, but,' said Diggs, 'that's no reason. I know of lots of
stations with graves on them, all over the country.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but ye don't know a case like this, for the troopers
happened to come that very night. The sergeant, he was a very
queer sort of cuss, and to save the trouble of carting them two
hundred miles as prisoners, he shot them both out of hand. Then
he swore, and his men swore, that they resisted, and fired at the
police.'</p>

<p>'I suppose they're pretty well rotten and decayed by this
time,' I said.</p>

<p>'I've more to tell you,' returned the old man. 'The one who
set them on to do the work was the biggest devil of the lot, and
that one was Smithfield's young wife. A handsome handful she was!
She walked out of the house on to the verandah and watched the
shooting. Then she called to the sergeant, 'Am I the next?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, Mrs. Smithfield?' said the sergeant, who
knew her, but nothing of her deviltry.</p>

<p>'That I had as much to do with it as anybody.'</p>

<p>'Then, if you make a confession like that, It's my plain duty
to make you my prisoner,' and he advanced towards her.</p>

<p>'No man will do that,' and therewith she put a pistol to her
head&mdash;one that she had held behind her all the
time&mdash;and shot herself.'</p>

<p>'Oh! I thought you were going to say shot the sergeant,' I
remarked.</p>

<p>'No, shot herself; there was no earthly use in shooting
anybody else,' said the old man, in annoyed tones. 'You see, that
made the party complete&mdash;old Smithfield, who was murdered;
the two murderers, who were executed; and the woman, who
committed suicide. A regular happy party to make a fresh start in
a new existence.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Diggs. 'That doesn't tell us why the homestead
was deserted for this place I suppose they were buried and done
with.'</p>

<p>'Oh! were they?' chuckled the old man with a ghastly laugh.
'Were they? Did you expect that those four could lie quiet, cheek
by jowl, like four little kids who'd been drowned in a Sunday
school picnic? My! you're soft. Old Smithfield's nephew came in
for the station, and up he came from the south to take delivery
and possession. Which, he did, and got things all licked into
shape when the trouble commenced. All four of 'em began to walk,
and old Smithfield began to have his innings.</p>

<p>'Man! to hear the yells, and the shrieks, and the groans, of
'em. To see old Smithfield with, the blood on his white hair,
where he had been chopped down by the axe, running after his
wicked wife. Through the house, through the walls, through the
table, beds, chairs, anything. Why, it was enough to make anyone
desert the place, wasn't it?'</p>

<p>'Depends on who they were,' said Diggs, who was a confirmed
sceptic.</p>

<p>'Does it?' said the old man, with a grunt. 'At any rate the
young fellow found that he couldn't keep a man on the place, for
it was not alone in the house, but outside as well, where old
Smithfield used to chase those two murderers and chop them about
with the axe, they groaning horrid all the while.'</p>

<p>'What did he want to do it for? His axe was not a real axe,
and he never hurt anybody.'</p>

<p>'I like your way of looking at it, as if the old fellow was
not due for his revenge. Anyhow, he did it. His nephew could not
sell the station with all that racketing going on, and so he
moved over, here. Now just tell me, will you? You seem to know so
much about it, what would you have done in Smithfield's
place?'</p>

<p>'Why,' answered Diggs, who was the man addressed, 'I'd have
washed the blood off my head, and tidied myself up, and if I felt
obliged to walk, of which I don't see the necessity, I'd have
done it in a quiet, decent manner, and not have gone ramping and
killing through another man's house, for you must admit that
after Smithfield was killed the house no longer belonged to
him.'</p>

<p>'So that is your way of looking at it, is it?' replied the old
man.</p>

<p>'It is,' returned Diggs, who seemed to take an interest in the
matter. I didn't speak myself. The old man amused me with his
thorough belief in the matter. The old fellow thanked us for the
spell and the tucker, and toddled off to the men's hut, where he
camped for the remainder, of the day.</p>

<p>'What do you think of him?' asked Diggs.</p>

<p>'Some looney old shepherd who has lost his wits. But we'll go
out to-night and camp on the site, and lay out our plans.'</p>

<p>It was a lovely spot for a homestead at Four Junction Creek,
and very central in every way. Diggs and I decided on the
respective buildings, with a due regard to my partner's
approaching marriage. We were not disturbed by anything during
the night, and laughed at the old man's story, which, we
presumed, he had learned by heart, and repeated at every station
for a dole of rations.</p>

<p><br>
ALL the time the removal and building were going on we were
kept hard at work, and never saw anything of old men with blood
stained hair on their heads and axes in their hands, careering
through the place.</p>

<p>At last it was all finished, and Diggs departed to bring home
a bride.</p>

<p>I was sitting in the cool of the evening on the verandah
smoking a meditative pipe, when an old fellow walked up, and,
bidding me good evening, ascended the verandah and took one of
the canvas chairs.</p>

<p>'I seem to remember your face,' I said, 'but I can't place
it.'</p>

<p>'Smithfield is my name. I saw you and your partner last year
at your old place.'</p>

<p>'The devil you did! I don't remember your name there.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I told you the story of this place, if you
remember.'</p>

<p>'Remember!' I cried, starting up. 'Are you the old
swagman?'</p>

<p>'I am, and I was so struck by your partner's advice that I
adopted it, and I think I shall be very much more
comfortable.'</p>

<p>'Then that murder and suicide story was a fact?'</p>

<p>'Actual fact; and I am thankful to you for not disturbing my
grave.'</p>

<p>'We saw a grave, and of course respected it.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and I promise in return to behave myself, and not play
any more fool's tricks.'</p>

<p>'What shall I call you if you turn up when there's anybody
here?'</p>

<p>'Whitefield will do; now I think I'll go back and turn in. I
just called to see if you were frightened, and don't intend to
bother you very much. Good night.'</p>

<p>'Good night, Mr. Whitefield,' I said, in reply, as he stepped
from the window, and went back to his grave.</p>

<p>He kept his word, and a more quiet, genial companion than that
ghost, on his occasional visits, I never met. Old Bagot took a
great liking to him. In due course Diggs came back with Mrs.
Diggs, and I warned Whitefield to keep away for a bit, so that I
could have an opportunity of putting Diggs up to his visits, and
he did so.</p>

<p>Diggs looked rather startled when I told him of Mr.
Whitefield's visits, but I assured him his behavior was most
discreet; he need not see much of the new 'missus.' Besides I
urged he had given up his howling, tearing tricks just to oblige
us, and had therefore a claim on our hospitality. He saw it in
this light after a bit, especially as he was the author of the
advice, so Whitefield resumed his visits, and all things went
smooth. Mrs. Diggs wondered much that she saw nothing of that
nice old gentleman, Mr. Whitefield, in the daytime; but Diggs
explained that his duties kept him busy.</p>

<p>Then came the great catastrophe that severed our
partnership.</p>

<p>Whitefield usually sat quietly on the verandah, not saying
much, but enjoying the company. This night, for some reason, Mrs.
Diggs asked him to come inside. He came, and stayed about an
hour, and then rose to go, and, forgetting my repeated warnings,
walked straight through the wall, instead of going through the
doorway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Diggs saw it, but thought her eyes must have deceived
her, when the wretched ghost, utterly forgetting himself, walked
back through the wall, and apologised, and went out through the
proper mode of exit. Mrs. Diggs sat down in shrieking hysterics,
and I gave Diggs a clear field to recover her. He had a terrible
job, I believe, being new at that sort of thing, but at last
succeeded in stilling her wild outcries to be 'sent back to her
mother,' and got her to bed.</p>

<p>It broke us up. She could not be persuaded to stop, and Diggs
and I had to agree to sell the station and relinquish
partnership. He took her down, and we sold the place very well.
Smithfield only turned up once, he felt so much ashamed of
himself. I refrained from reproach, for I knew he was as truly
sorry as any ghost could be.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>07. &mdash; MY SOCIALIST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 10 April 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
I KNEW that Sir Denvil Dancer was a fool&mdash;it did not take
long to find that out; but for all that, he was a baronet, and
when a fellow is travelling with his family on board a P-and-O
steamer it looks well to know, and be on familiar terms with a
baronet. It impresses your fellow-passengers; not that I am aware
that there is any benefit to be derived from that, but it is the
correct thing to do&mdash;to impress your fellow-passengers, and
regard everyone else as though they had lately been shot up out
of a volcano. Well, Sir Denvil Dancer had allowed me to become
intimate with him on the voyage out&mdash;allowed me to
monopolise him, in fact, and dearly have I paid for that
condescension.</p>

<p>We arrived in Sydney, and Sir Denvil Dancer went to the club,
and my wife and I returned to our olive branches and our home.
But Sir Denvil was not ungrateful. He came put and had dinner
with us once or twice, and finally departed on his fatuous,
globe-trotting way to Noumea, by the M.M. steamer.</p>

<p>More than two months had passed, when one day a vagrant
individual presented himself at my house, and demanded in broken
English to see me. After much hesitation he was ushered into the
room I call my study, though I generally use it to go to sleep
in.</p>

<p>I was told of his presence, and went there. He was seedy, but
not with the seediness of an English, vagabond. He was
picturesque and theatrical. He looked like, the man who comes on
the stage in rags. But he was very dirty, there was no mistake
about that.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet when I entered, and uttering some remark
about 'Sir Denveel Dansah,' presented me with a letter from that
esteemed member of the aristocracy. I asked him to be seated
whilst I read the epistle. It ran thus:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Bagshot,</span></p>

<p class="letter">
The bearer&mdash;M. Louis Derona&mdash;is, unfortunately,
under a cloud for some political offence that we should think
nothing of. I have told him to call on you, if he manages to
reach Sydney and that you will gladly befriend him for my sake.</p>

<br>

<p>Then followed the usual good wishes and compliments to self
and wife.</p>

<p>Now, have you ever noticed how a fool always gets the best of
you? A man may go through life as a drivelling idiot; but he
always complacently gets someone else to hold the baby. One of
the best characters in the world, to assume is that of a
fool&mdash;he always gets the best of it.</p>

<p>My friend Sir Denvil Dancer did not put himself out of the way
to assist M. Louis Derona, under a political cloud! Oh! no. He
passed him on to me. I had scarcely finished reading the letter,
when my uninvited guest sprang up, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is what you call all right, then? You are my dear
Backshot, the friend of Sir Dansah?' How he rolled out that
horrible 'Dansah.'</p>

<p>I admitted that I was Bagshot, and immediately his arms were
round my neck. I disentangled myself, and we got seated again,
and a happy thought struck me. I offered him a cigar, and rang
for some refreshments. At any rate, that would keep his arms away
from me. He accepted a cigar with gratitude, and when the spirits
were brought in I expected to see him greedily swallow half a
tumbler full; but no. He poured himself out a very little brandy,
and filled his tumbler up with water; but his eyes glistened at
the biscuits in the jar. Sir Denvil's friend Derona was evidently
half-starved.</p>

<p>I sat down thoroughly puzzled. Was he an escapee? I did not
think so. But what was I to do with him? The poor devil, whoever
he was, had come to me, evidently in bitter want, on the strength
of the confounded Baronet's letter, and I couldn't well turn him
out in the street.</p>

<p>I would consult with my wife. I knew, of course, what she
would say beforehand; but still it was necessary to tell her. The
fellow, as I said before, was a picturesque blackguard, and would
pass muster with women. I made some excuse, and went in search of
her. She said exactly what I anticipated; said that she always
thought Sir Denvil was a horrid, selfish cad; she never approved
of my making friends with him, and, finally, she would see this
man, and get rid of him pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Full of this design, she proceeded to my study. Derona sprang
up again at her appearance. And was this the charming Mme.
Backshot whom his friend Sir Dansah raved about? Might he, most
respectfully, salute madame's hand? And madame gave him her hand,
and sat down and asked this poor, starving, hungry-eyed devil if
he had had a pleasant voyage? and did he like Noumea as a place
of residence?</p>

<p>Well, there's no counting on a woman! What with the biscuits
and the weak brandy and water, and the sight of a petticoat,
Derona plucked up wonderfully, and when my wife rose to go, and,
by mental telegraphy indicated that she wished to speak with me,
he darted to the door, and held it open for her, with a low
bow.</p>

<p>'We must ask him to stay to dinner,' said my wife, coming with
a letter of introduction from Sir Denvil, you know.'</p>

<p>I murmured a few words concerning her saying something about
getting rid of him, but she took me up at once.</p>

<p>'Nonsense! The man is quite different to what you described
him. He must he somebody, for Sir Denvil to have done so much for
him&mdash;'</p>

<p>Here I coughed loudly.</p>

<p>'You heard how he spoke of him as his good and generous
friend?' she said, indignantly.</p>

<p>'Has imaginative manner; he called you the charming Mme.
Bagshot.'</p>

<p>'If, instead of trying to be satirical, you thought I of
something sensible, it would be more to the purpose.'</p>

<p>'Very well, I will try and find out who he is and what he
wants.'</p>

<p>'The Duneauves were over in New Caledonia lately,' said my
wife. 'Ask him if he met them.'</p>

<p>'Look here,' I said, exasperated; 'the poor w retch is a
starved stowaway, I take it. He is probably a released prisoner,
without money or friends, who came across Dancer, and he, like
the dog he is, instead of paying his passage to Marseilles, which
he could easily have dome, gave him a letter to me. If there's
nothing criminal about the fellow I'll see what the Consul here
and some of his own countrymen will do to get him a passage. I'll
invite him to dinner, tout don't torment him by asking him how he
liked the climate of Noumea.'</p>

<p>I left before my wife had time to formulate a fitting answer,
and joined Derona. His story was very much what I had guessed. A
penniless man, released from prison, he had appealed to Sir
Denvil, and "the fool" had scored by sending him on to me with
his blessing and the letter.</p>

<p>He had got across by same connivance of a friend in the
engine-room, and wandered about Sydney, foodless and shelterless,
for two days before some friendly person, to whom he showed the
address on the letter, directed him to my house.</p>

<p>I had formed a plan concerning him, and by a few adroit
questions managed to find out that his offence was really a mere
political one that British law would not condescend to notice. He
was a boyish fellow, whom the mere talking to, and the effect of
sitting in a decent room, had restored to self-confidence and
harmless audacity.</p>

<p>Mr. Dick's advice to Miss Trotwood was strong within
me&mdash;'I should wash him.' I determined to do so. It was still
early in the day, so I took my new friend into town, and by the
evening, I had made him a different man. He was a well-made
fellow, easy to fit, and the ready-made clothes sat on him as if
built by a first-class tailor. As we passed a florist's window I
saw him look longingly therein, and I gratified him by adding the
desired flowers. He was magnificently and childishly happy. His
hair cut short, beard pointed and moustache waxed, the adored
frock coat on his back, a glass of absinthe in his digestive
organs, I took back a prince, whom I had received as a houseless
vagrant.</p>

<p>It was worth the money to see how he flashed forth at the
dinner-table. The repression of three years had to find vent, and
always he wound up with a reference to his good, his admirable
friend, Sir Dansah.</p>

<p>I carried out my little programme, and was met with a generous
response. Derona was taken up and helped. It was some time before
the M.M. steamer left, and at his earnest request took him one
evening to the talk-shop in Macquarie-street. Never did I see a
man so interested in the dreary twaddles of the ordinary
politician. Suddenly he gripped my arm fiercely and looking up I
saw his gaze fixed intently on the speaker who at that moment had
the ear of the House.</p>

<p>It was a harmless speech, and made by the harmless leader of
the Opposition; but it excited Derona so that I was glad to get
him outside.</p>

<p>'Ah!' he aid; 'why had I not a bomb to cast at that
oppressor's feet and shatter the tyrant!'</p>

<p>'What's the matter? He was only advocating a tax on
coffee.'</p>

<p>'That is everything, my friend. Nobody but a tyrant would tax
anything. Here, now,' he went on, 'is an honest man of work,'
stopping a passing mechanic.</p>

<p>'Do you like being taxed, my friend?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm hanged if I do,' replied the astonished man.</p>

<p>'That is so. We are of one mind. Down with taxation. Down with
the tyrant.'</p>

<p>And he shook the dumbfounded artisan by the hand.</p>

<p>'I live but for one thing,' he continued, as I got him away,
'and that is to see my good and generous friend, Sir Dansah take
has seat in your Common House.'</p>

<p>Luckily I thought of the Domain, and its orators on Sunday
afternoon, and that fairly enchanted him. To see him stand in a
Napoleonic attitude, with his arms, folded, and a fierce frown on
his face, was worth money.</p>

<p>Finally the time dawned for the steamer to leave, and he came
to have a farewell dinner with us. He asked me, as a favor, to
let him propose the health of our dear but absent friend, Sir
Dansah! And he cried over my wife's hand when he said good-bye;
but he never thanked me.</p>

<p>His countrymen came to see him off when the steamer started,
and he hung over the rail as she was warped out, and shouted
affectionate messages to his dear Sir Dansah, and made a
spectacle of me and himself. Then the steamer disappeared round
the point, and I went home to meditate on snobbishness and its
reward.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
OUR next visitor was Sir Dancer himself, going round the world
the other way in his slow, stupid, unseeing manner. I came home
one afternoon, and found him explaining to my wife how Derona had
aroused his sympathy by his helpless condition, and he had gone
out of his way to serve him, and a heap of other fat lies that my
wife either believed, or pretended to believe. But there. I give
women up.</p>

<p>Sir Denvil dined with us once or twice, and then left for San
Francisco, still in his selfish, phlegmatic way, playing the
fool; and I naturally thought that I had seen the end both of him
and Derona, but I had not.</p>

<p>Derona arrived in France safely, and wrote to me, saying that
he had joined the staff of a southern newspaper, and after a
month or two began to send me copies, which, as I am a wretched
hand at attempting to read French, were not of much good to me.
My wife, however, seemed to like to get them&mdash;it gave us a
sort of travelled air with the postman, I suppose.</p>

<p>Presently one came with a marked paragraph. I puzzled that
out, and found that it referred to the 'celebrated English
philanthropist, Sir Denvil Dancer, Baronet,' arriving somewhere
or departing somewhere, or doing something. Then came another,
and I found that referred to the wedding of that celebrated
philanthropist and renowned traveller, etc., which that
infatuated fool, Derona, had come across in some obscure English
county paper.</p>

<p><br>
A YEAR passed, and Sir Denvil and his wife came to Sydney on
one of the baronet's periodical excursions, by which he sustained
the reputation of being a scientific traveller. Lady Dancer was a
tall, fine woman, infinitely superior to her husband, who was
fatter and more foolish than ever, and they had scarcely left
before, to our astonishment, Derona put in an appearance.</p>

<p>He was in great feather, had come out to see about some
antimony mines reported to exist in New South Wales, partly for
his paper, and partly for some capitalists. He was as big a foe
of taxation in any form as ever&mdash;I believe he thought it a
hardship to have to pay his railway fare. He was moved to tears
when he heard that, he had just missed his distinguished
benefactor, as he now termed him.</p>

<p>However, Sir Denvil was coming back, and Derona vowed to be
down in Sydney to meet him, and he did, the antimony mines having
been disappointing, to put it mildly. To hear him explain to Lady
Dancer how her husband had heard of his languishing in chains,
and had travelled all the way out to New Caledonia to use his
influence to release him was very amusing. And Lady Dancer found
it so, for she laughed heartily at the relation, and evidently
knew too much about her husband to believe a word of it.</p>

<p>Derona came to me a day or two afterwards, and in broken tones
assured me that he knew his esteemed friend was not happy in his
marriage.</p>

<p>'That woman,' he said, 'is cold, unsympathetic; she does not
appreciate and admire the noble qualities of Sir Dansah.'</p>

<p>I told him that I thought Lady Dansah did exactly estimate the
qualities of Sir Denvil, and was a woman in a thousand. But he
would not have it. Sir Denvil should have married somebody light,
sympathetic, spiritual, who would have led him on to becoming
Lord Mayor, which was the highest dignity my friend could think
of just then.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he had a brilliant notion.</p>

<p>'I will release my friend, even as he released me. See! I will
make love to her, and run away with her!'</p>

<p>This was said in such preposterously innocent good faith that
I had to look grave to keep myself from laughing outright in his
face. He mistook my expression, for he went on.</p>

<p>'Ah! you condemn, you disapprove. But what care I for right or
wrong, or what you call morality!'</p>

<p>'My dear Derona,' I said, 'perhaps I care as little about
morality as you do; but I, know if you attempt to make love to
Lady Dancer she will probably take you by the ear and lay into
you with a whip herself.'</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and went away, evidently revolving
schemes for the happy release of his esteemed friend Sir Dansah,
who had just the capable sort of wife to suit such a dull-brained
clod.</p>

<p>I did not witness the catastrophe, but Lady Dancer told me
about it.</p>

<p>'Jim literally drowned the poor man,' she said. 'I can never
bear to see him again; I shall dream of it always.'</p>

<p>This is what happened. Sir Denvil, his wife, and Derona were
out in a boat in the harbor. Whose fault it was I don't know.
Derona was dilating on the beauties of social equality, and
suppose Dancer was asleep, when they were run down by one of the
small steamers, and found themselves afloat in the water.</p>

<p>Lady Dancer could swim, and fortunately got hold of one of the
sculls. Derona, like most Frenchmen, had received a good athletic
training, and was a strong swimmer; but poor Sir Denvil could
just paddle feebly. Derona would have gone first to Lady Dancer's
assistance, but she called to him that she was quite safe till
the boat came, so he turned his attention to the struggling,
gasping baronet. Now the easiest way to support a man, if he has
presence of mind, is to let him rest his hands lightly on your
shoulders, which leaves your own hands free to swim with; if he
hasn't got presence of mind you had best grab him behind somehow,
to avoid his grabbing you.</p>

<p>Derona probably thought that Sir Denvil was fully possessed of
his wits; that such a great and good man could not get paralysed
with funk; he therefore got the baronet to rest his hands oh his
shoulders for support till help came. Now resting, and putting
your whole weight on, are two very different things, and when the
pudgy frightened man got his hands on Derona's shoulders he
downed him under water immediately.</p>

<p>It must have been a horrible sight for Lady Dancer, who had
drifted too far away to render assistance. Vainly she shrieked to
her husband, whose head was visible, to let go, but he was deaf
with fright.</p>

<p>Once Derona managed to get to the surface, but he could not
free himself from that desperate, tenacious, drowning clutch, and
went under again. Even then, if the boat from the steamer had
gone to the men first, they might both have been saved, but
naturally they made to pick up the woman, and when they finally
pulled the unfortunate Derona and his admired friend out of the
water, one was past recovery.</p>

<p>They coaxed back life in the baronet, but the other poor,
foolish, gallant soul had fled. Lady Dancer kept her word; she
returned to England by herself, and I understand they have since
lived apart.</p>

<p>Sir Denvil Dancer doesn't seem to mind, however; he has to act
up to the part of a fool, it suits him so well.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>08. &mdash; THE ABDUCTION OF NETTLETOP</h2>

<h3><i>Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, 9 October
1907</h3>

<p class="first">
THE three men sat on the top-rail of the horse yard, enjoying
the mixed delight of a Sunday morning smoke and a good horse
yarn. A black-boy was permitted to cockatoo as well; but he was a
superior boy from the Dawson River, in Queensland, who had been
in the native police in the old days, and always spoke of the
other blacks about the place as 'niggers.'</p>

<p>It being Sunday, only a few horses were in the yard for
special purposes, but they were sufficient to serve as a text,
and that was all that was wanted.</p>

<p>The super and a young jackeroo might be seen in idleness on
the station homestead verandah; and though they would, in their
hearts, have dearly liked to have sunk all social distinctions
and joined the gossiping party, and aired their experiences of
horses and their ways, still, the unwritten law of station
etiquette must be observed, no matter how a man's soul may lust
after the dear delight of a good blow.</p>

<p>Australia has her full share of fine, enjoyable
mornings&mdash;some residents even say that she has occasionally
more than her share&mdash;but on this Sunday there had been a
sufficiency of rain for all pastoral purposes, and life was worth
living and man felt like a man towards his fellow worm.</p>

<p>Harry Braybridge, the super, was a good-tempered young fellow,
who got along smoothly with his men, and Brinkingdale, though but
a far-back cattle station, had no fly of large dimensions in its
local honey pot.</p>

<p>Just now Braybridge was lazily thinking in a dreamy sort of
way, of how bewitching and charming the figure of a certain girl
of his acquaintance looked in a riding habit. Sparks, the
jackeroo, was reflecting with complacency that his moustache was
really sprouting at last. One of the yarning stockmen was
meditating with pride on the last jocularity he had got off; and
the cook in the kitchen, who was an artist in his way, was
cogitating over the respective merits of a bun-loaf and a
fat-cake for Sunday's dinner, when Braybridge started up with
an exclamation that astonished everybody.</p>

<p>The peace of the quiet morn was rudely disturbed, for his
sudden ejaculation had been loud enough and hot enough to put
everybody's seraphic calm to flight. Braybridge had been
pleasantly and idly dreaming, as aforesaid, of the rounded
contours of a girl whom he was beginning to admire very much, of
her graceful seat on a horse, and then, by an easy transition, of
how well she would look on Nettletop&mdash;then, with a start and
the loud outcry that had so upset the erstwhile Sabbath
calm&mdash;'Where is Nettletop? When did I see him last?'</p>

<p>And with a jump and a roar Braybridge plunged off the
verandah, and hurried up to the yard to question the men on the
matter. It was very strange, nobody could exactly call to mind
when they had seen Nettletop last. He was the pride of
Brinkingdale, who was destined to carry the station colours to
victory in the next race meeting.</p>

<p>All agreed that it was about a week ago, but nothing more
definite, and as such a state of anxiety was insupportable, two
men and the black boy were at once bidden to go down the big
horse paddock after the missing animal, and make sure that he was
safe. Dinner time arrived, and the meal, greatly to the disgust
of the cook, who, like most artists, had a tender soul, was not
appreciated.</p>

<p>Time drew on, the men returned, and to the astonishment and
dismay of every one were willing, individually or separately, to
asseverate on a sackful of Bibles, if necessary, that Nettletop
was not visible above ground within the bounds of the big horse
paddock.</p>

<p>This was a staggerer. It was too late to start out again on a
forlorn hope, even if anyone could suggest where to go; there was
nothing for it but to seek, an uneasy couch, after sitting up
debating the possibilities and impossibilities of every phase of
the question. Nettletop was gone, of that there was no doubt. It
was a long time before the races, and the horse had only been
turned out to stretch his shapely legs for a bit, no one dreaming
but what he was as safe as the proverbial house.</p>

<p>Braybridge, whose temperament was what is called mercurial,
alternating between hope and despair, went to bed with but one
thought in his brain&mdash;Nettletop, the rising star of hope,
was gone.</p>

<p>The next morning, everybody on Brinkingdale rose feeling that
a subtle atmosphere of impending gloom overhung the station. The
cook's temper, always regretfully short, was that morning worn
into rags and tatters, by the unusually well-behaved milkers
refusing to give their milk down freely, and indulging in several
other little idiosyncrasies that no rightly-disposed milker
should ever Indulge in.</p>

<p>Braybridge himself, on the testimony of Sparks, got out of bed
on the wrong side, although from the arrangement of the furniture
it was a physical impossibility so to do. The stockman condensed
the general feeling in a few words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I feel just as though I had been on the tear last night, and
hadn't a pick-me-up to settle my nerves this morning.'</p>

<p>The morning was devoted to another fruitless search for the
missing horse, and the day passed without further elucidation of
the mystery of Nettletop's disappearance.</p>

<p>On the following morning, however, Braybridge roused himself like
the infuriated Achilles. Sitting still would do no good, nor would
pottering about after tracks that, when found, proved to be those of a
horse with a clean bill of health; no, he must bestir himself in the
matter if he ever wished to see Nettletop again. He sallied forth to
inform the police, offer a reward, and give a description of the horse,
and let the other neighbouring stations know that they might keep a
look-out for his missing property. For Nettletop was his own ewe lamb,
and not station property.</p>

<p><br>
FIVE AND TWENTY miles from Brinkingdale was a sheep station
called Red Plains, owned by Beveridge, a man of means, who
resided on it with his two sons and one daughter. His wife was a
chronic invalid, and the reins of domestic government were in the
capable hands of Miss Beveridge, who, truth to tell, was the
young lady with the trim figure who haunted Harry Braybridge's
waking dreams.</p>

<p>Red Plains was on his road to the police station, and from the
fair lady in question, who was as good a horse-lover as she was a
bonnie girl, Braybridge was sure of much kindly sympathy, as well
as indignation at the theft.</p>

<p>He stayed that night at Red Plains, and received the tenderest
commiseration from Miss Beveridge, together with the outspoken
vituperation of her young brother, Jim; who vowed that the
American custom of hanging horse thieves would alone satisfy the
outraged laws of the land.</p>

<p>Considering that Jim was but a boy of 18, and had always had a
sneaking regard for bushranging literature, this fiery
denunciation rather surprised Braybridge. But he was still more
surprised when Jim, at the suggestion of his sister, offered to
ride with him next day to the police station, saying that the
inspector in charge was an old friend of his father's and would
put himself out of his way to interest himself in the matter.</p>

<p>So the next morning Braybridge left, feeling that the loss of
a hundred Nettletops was well repaid by the interest in his
misfortune evinced by Miss Beveridge.</p>

<p>'Going to have any horses in, Jim?' said Braybridge, as they
rode on, referring to the coming race meeting.</p>

<p>'Just one for the sake of the station's name; but he has
turned out a duffer. We haven't got a flyer like your's.'</p>

<p>'Like mine was,' returned the other, dolefully.</p>

<p>'Oh, cheer up,' said Jim, 'he'll turn up all right, yet.'</p>

<p>He heaved a dolorous sigh. 'I should have liked your sister to
have tried him,' he said. 'Nettletop would have made a perfect
lady's hack.'</p>

<p>'I'll tell her,' said Jim.</p>

<p>'Oh,' replied poor Braybridge, who was rapidly getting down in
the dumps again, 'it's too late now.'</p>

<p>'Better late than never,' said Jim, with cheerful
irrelevance.</p>

<p>Arrived at the township, they interviewed the police
inspector, who promised all due aid and assistance; and,
furthermore, had a private and apparently most important
interview with Jim.</p>

<p>'We've made a bit of a private racecourse,' said Jim, as they
rode back to Red Plains, the following afternoon, 'but our colt
turned out such a crawler that I don't suppose it will be used
unless you like to have a flutter with Nettletop&mdash;when you
get him back, I mean.'</p>

<p>'It's confidential information that I am disclosing to you,'
said the inspector, 'but it is as true as gospel, and as I
thought that we could manage it quietly amongst ourselves, I am
taking you into my confidence, and have not brought any of my men
with me.'</p>

<p>The inspector was out at Birkingdale, talking to Braybridge
with a glass of whisky and water and a preternaturally quiet
face.</p>

<p>'Going to have another go at the place, are they? And we'll
lie in wait and catch them red-handed. Jove, it's just the chance
I want.</p>

<p>'Let me get my hands on the chap who stole Nettletop, and he
won't want to steal another horse for some time.'</p>

<p>The inspector had come out to Brinkingdale with the
information that he had heard that the horse thieves meditated
another swoop, and was making arrangements with Braybridge to lay
a trap for them and catch them in the act. The next afternoon,
about 4 o'clock, was to be the critical time, which, the
inspector informed Braybridge, he had found out through one of
the gang having turned King's evidence, and the preparations for
the surprise party were made accordingly.</p>

<p>The inspector and Braybridge and the black boy were to secrete
themselves outside the fence at a particular spot where the fence
ran through a belt of scrub; and the other men were to be on
watch about the sliprails and secure them, after the thieves had
passed through, and so pound them In the paddock.</p>

<p>The thieves in the paddock were going to muster the horses up,
and pass those they had selected through a panel, where the wire
had been cut, to the two principals in waiting.</p>

<p>'By the Lord Harry, it they haven't got a cheek, to expect, to
do this in broad daylight!' sputtered Harry savagely.</p>

<p>'Looks as if they were not much afraid of your catching them,'
said the chuckling inspector.</p>

<p>'Nor the police, either,' returned Braybridge, viciously.</p>

<p>All went well, and the Inspector and his two attendants were
safely and closely secreted in the patch of scrub to await
events. The officer produced, with some ostentation so Braybridge
thought, a pair of handcuffs and a regulation revolver. He handed
another pair of bracelets to him, saying:</p>

<p>'You know the knack of slipping them on, and you've your own
revolver?'</p>

<p>Braybridge nodded, and then commenced the weary, nervous
expectancy of waiting.</p>

<p>'That fellow come up,' said the black-boy quietly.</p>

<p>They peered cautiously out of their leafy screen. Two riders
were approaching, and three horses, one being led. Were his eyes
deceiving him? Had madness suddenly assailed him?</p>

<p>The two riders were Miss Beveridge and her young brother Jim.
And the led horse was the long-sought Nettletop.</p>

<p>He would have risen and made his presence known, but the stern
hand of the policeman withheld him. The pair rode up to the fence
and dismounted. Jim went up to a panel and pressed the wire down,
then he slipped out his stirrup-leathers and strapped the top and
bottom wires together, making it low enough for any horse to
almost step over.</p>

<p>But Nettletop when led up to it obstinately refused so to do.
The strain of some wire-hating ancestor asserted itself, and he
declined to enter.</p>

<p>'Put my saddle on,' said Miss Beveridge, who was watching the
struggle.</p>

<p>'Don't come a cropper,' said Jim, with all the calm
nonchalance of a brother, as he changed his sister's saddle on to
Nettletop.</p>

<p>'Not if you brush it up well,' she replied, and Jim, breaking
down the needful boughs, concealed the hateful wires with a
clumsy baulk. He gave his sister a hand up, and taking a short
canter she put Nettletop at the boughs, and he cleared the
obstruction like a bird. Once more he was at home in his own
familiar paddock.</p>

<p>Miss Beveridge took her saddle off, handed it across the fence
to Jim, then, as she slipped the bridle off the horse's head took
his nose in both her hands, gave him a kiss on the tip of it, and
said: 'Good-bye, old fellow. Mind and win the race for
Harry.'</p>

<p>Nettletop galloped off with an ungrateful snort, and the
concealed party broke from their ambush.</p>

<p>'Stand, in the King's name!' sang out the laughing
inspector.</p>

<p>'It's a hoax, I see,' said Braybridge, 'but I'd have it all
over again to feel as jolly as I do at this moment.'</p>

<p>'Yes, we wanted to try the two horses on the measured course,
on the quiet, and see what chance our horse had,' explained Jim,
'and we hadn't a show.'</p>

<p>'I wish I had been the horse just now,' whispered Harry, as he
put Miss Beveridge up on her own horse. 'But he shall win that
race, or I'll break my neck.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>09. &mdash; JOBBLESTONE'S CURRY</h2>

<h3><i>Mercury</i>, Hobart, 11 July 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
I HAVE always looked up to and admired the people of good
birth and standing, and in consequence when I found myself
wrecked on a desert island with an aristocratic widow and the
highly-descended Mr. Jobblestone, I naturally took up an inferior
position.</p>

<p>I will not go into the story of the wreck; suffice it to say
that with my assistance the aristocratic widow got ashore; and
Jobblestone was washed ashore also. Of the rest of the
passengers, officers and crew of the steamer, I confess I do not
know. I imagine they got away in the boats, and in the confusion
my companions and myself were left behind. It was a small island
in the Pacific, uninhabited, but with plenty of coconut trees,
bearing fruit, growing on it, and, as I afterwards found out,
turtles, fish, and shellfish in the sur-rounding waters.
Moreover, when day-light broke, we saw that the hull of the
steamer had been driven well ashore, and at low tide could be
easily reached; so her cargo was available for use.</p>

<p>The day was fine, and the sea going down, and the outlook was
not so bad. I managed to regain the deck of the wrecked steamer,
and obtained from the widow's cabin some necessary articles for
her to make her toilet after the night's adventures. Jobblestone
wished to go, but the widow would not hear of it, so he allowed
me to go and fetch him also a dry suit out of his cabin.</p>

<p>The widow adjourned to the opposite side of the island when I
returned, and Jobblestone and I changed our clothes, and
discussed the situation. He agreed that I should keep a signal
fire burning day and night, with the aid of timbers from the
wreck; that I should bring as many stones ashore as possible, in
case of the wreck breaking up; fruit I should build a shelter
ashore for the widow; and that he should constitute himself
chief adviser and superintendent. Knowing his birth and breeding,
I consented&mdash;for, as I said before, I felt honoured by
performing any small services for a distinguished gentleman far
above me in a social position. That was a failing, a weakness, of
mine; but it is effectually cured.</p>

<p>So I worked hard while Jobblestone talked to the aristocratic
widow, and told her how Jobblestone was a corruption of
Joppastone in consequence of one of his ancestors, a Crusader,
having been hit on the head with a stone at the taking of Joppa.
The widow, the Hon. Mrs. Carbuncle, approved of the rustic
shelter I constructed for her, also of the dishes I cooked, the
fish I caught, and the coconuts I obtained. As for Jobblestone,
he did nothing but give good advice.</p>

<p>"I am going to try some curried turtle," said I to him one
day. "I think it would make a good dish; so I'll go on board the
wreck and have a hunt amongst the ship's stores for some curry
powder."</p>

<p>Jobblestone looked uncomfortable. "I wouldn't if I were you,"
he said. "I don't think that the Honourable Mrs. Carbuncle, likes
curry."</p>

<p>I asked her the question.</p>

<p>"I adore it," she replied; "simply adore it. And what is more,
I am a very good hand at making it. At least my dear late husband
always thought and said so. Jackson, find me some curry powder,
and I will kill time making curries. We have everything here that
is wanted, including coconut."</p>

<p>Jobblestone said nothing, but I noticed that he was deadly
pale. He wandered away from us, and stood musing on the coral
sand. I passed him as I went to the wreck. He had been tracing
some-thing on the sand, which he tried to efface as I approached;
but I saw what it was. He had written three words:</p>

<p>"Curry, currie, curree." What it meant I know not; but he was
ghastly to look at. I went on board and started to search. It was
long before I was successful; but at last I found what I sought a
small case of curry powder. It was branded on the outside, "One
dozen bottles of Jobblestone's Marvellous Curree Powder."</p>

<p>I started as read. Was the man an impostor? His sudden pallor,
the coincidence of name, and the writing on the sand, all, all
were evidence against him. Instead of his ancestors being valiant
Crusaders, they&mdash;or at least a recent one, if not the man
himself&mdash;made and sold curry powder. I would expose him, for
I felt that the devotion of a lifetime had been thrown away. I
carried the case ashore and opened it; then took out a bottle and
gave it to Mrs. Carbuncle. She did not look at the label, for she
was busy chopping up turtle meat, and coconut and other things. I
said nothing, but assisted her in the cookery until the dish was
ready and the rice properly cooked. Then we called Jobblestone,
who, in company with an evil conscience, was wandering aloof. He
came and with a sickly smile said that he did not like curry.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mrs. Carbuncle. "I have made this myself. You
must eat some. I insist."</p>

<p>He took a plate of it, with a bad grace, and we all fell to.
It was a capital curry. As a judge of curries, I say with a clear
conscience that it was the best curry I ever tasted.</p>

<p>"That is excellent curry powder," said the widow; "let me see
who is the maker of it." She took up the bottle and read,
"Jobblestone's Marvellous Curree Powder."</p>

<p>"What a strange coincidence! No relation of yours, Mr.
Jobblestone, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Jobblestone rose to his feet and hurled his plate far from
him. "Madam," he said, "it is my unhappy father. Listen! While I
was wandering down on the beach I saw in the distance a fleet of
war canoes approaching. In half an hour they will be here, and we
shall be there," and he pointed upwards. "Under the circumstances
I will reveal my guilty secret. My father was a poor man, but, I
hope, honest, for he knew how to make good curry powder, and did
not deceive the public. But his curry powder did not sell, and we
boys had to eat it all. We had curry for breakfast, dinner, and
tea. We had little else to eat; in fact, nothing with which to
gratify the pangs of hunger but curry. My father was
conscientious, and knowing that the curry powder was good,
determined that it should not be wasted. If the public would not
buy it, we must eat it. Can you wonder that I loathe the sight of
curry. But a change came. My father had tried to sell his curry
powder under different names. I admit that the idea occurred to
me of selling curry&mdash;curree. The idea took with the public,
and my father died rich, leaving the bulk of his fortune to me,
on consideration that the business was carried on. It is being
carried on by my brothers, but I wander over all the world
telling the name of curry, but even on this desolate isle my fate
has found me out."</p>

<p>"Then your ancestor was not a Crusader?" said Mrs.
Carbuncle.</p>

<p>"He might have been anything for all that I know, or care. But
the enemy approaches."</p>

<p>"In the first place Jobblestone," I said, "you just go and do
some work; go and hold them in conversation for a while."</p>

<p>"I will," he said meekly; "but I fear my eloquence will be
thrown away." But he went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carbuncle and I set to work and carried the whole of the
turtle. Fortunately, a breeze sprang up and delayed their
landing, and by that time we had every available utensil filled
up with fragrant curry. The fleet of canoes resolved itself into
two, and the savages, ten in number, landed. Some were returned
islanders, and could talk a little English. We offered them
curry, and they fell upon it tooth and nail&mdash;mostly tooth.
Now was our chance. We ran down to the canoes and launched them.
Jobblestone would have stepped into the same one that we were in,
but Mrs. Carbuncle sternly pointed to the other, and said, "No,
impostor; henceforth I know you not."</p>

<p>Fortunately a trading schooner hove in sight, and we were soon
picked up. On hearing our story, the captain put back to the
island, salvaged the cargo, and offered the islanders the option
of going back as labourers to Queensland, or remaining, without
anything to eat. They all went, and the captain made a good thing
out of that cruise.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mrs. Carbuncle, who was as big an impostor as
Jobblestone, but a very good cook, forgave him, and married him.
As for me, my reverence for high-born people is shattered for
ever, since that little adventure.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>10. &mdash; A RESURRECTION</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 15 July 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
A TYPHOON was howling astern, and we were doing our level best
to keep, ahead of it; also we had but the faintest possible
notion of where we were, except that it was somewhere off the
north coast of Borneo, so that things were particularly exciting.
Our engines were first-class, nearly as good as our engineers,
otherwise we should have been pooped over and over again; but as
yet we had escaped with flooded cabins and saloon.</p>

<p>The cook was a Chinaman, and a martinet, and kept his boys
going under the greatest provocation, and only said 'What for?'
when he was chucked bodily, by a sea, into the galley on top of
one of the boys, who unwillingly, but kindly, saved him from
being roasted on the stove by falling underneath.</p>

<p>The cabin boys, too, right down to the lowest number, worked
well, and we were anticipating getting out of the trouble with
safety, when an obvious list became observable in the steamer
late one night. In twelve hours the list was more than
obvious&mdash;it became mighty uncomfortable, and it was patent
that our cargo had shifted.</p>

<p>Things began to look ominous, when the weather made a pretence
of breaking, and cleared sufficient to show us a group of
islands. We were in time to stand off, and then took the
opportunity of running under lee of the group, and found
ourselves in comparatively tranquil water, with our decks swept
almost clean of everything by the seas which broke and tumbled
over us as we changed our course. Worst of all, the captain was
swept off the bridge, and although he fortunately did not go
overboard, he had three of his ribs broken, and his leg also
broken.</p>

<p>While the doctor and one or two volunteers looked after him,
the chief got the vessel into an anchorage; and afterwards the
chief engineer and his crowd went over the engines to see if they
had not received any injury from the constant racing which they
had inevitably undergone. We had been bound from Singapore to
Hongkong, but the typhoon had blown us right away out of our
course, and we had only the most forlorn idea as to the identity
of the group under which we had sheltered.</p>

<p>There were only five of us passengers on board, and one woman,
who was getting a passage to Hongkong by acting as stewardess;
but as we had no lady passengers her billet was a sinecure. When
the next morning broke, the storm had blown itself out, leaving,
of course, a big sea on; but overhead the sky was blue, and
summer like.</p>

<p>The group we were under appeared to consist of a good number
of islands of the usual type of those seas fringed with bamboo
and mangroves, and with a scattered village arid patches of
cultivation visible on the nearest one.</p>

<p>'When the sea goes down, we'll send ashore and get some fowls
and eggs,' said the second officer, who was standing amongst us
while we were examining the group.</p>

<p>'Take my advice and do nothing of the sort, said one of the
passengers, an elderly man of reserved manner, who had joined us
at Singapore.</p>

<p>We looked at him inquiringly, and he went on, 'I used to know
the ways of all these islanders about these seas, and I don't
suppose they have changed very much since my time. They'll come
on soon enough with their eggs and poultry, and come aboard if we
are fools enough to let them, and have their knives at our
throats in no time. I'll go with the chief and speak to the
captain if you like, and tell him what I think. Is he well
enough, doctor?'</p>

<p>'No, he is feverish. Tell the chief all you know; he's in
charge.' Paine, which was the name of the hitherto silent
passenger, went forward, leaving us remarking on the singular
change in his manner. We saw him and the chief officer in earnest
discussion; then one of the quartermasters was summoned, and he
and another, went down and brought up the rifles from the stand,
and commenced examining them.</p>

<p>Before we went down to breakfast all the Europeans on board
had a revolver on, and a rifle apportioned to him.</p>

<p>'The fact of the matter is this,' said Paine, as we sat at
breakfast; 'the list we have got will make these fellows imagine
that we are either broken down or hard and fast on a bank, and
they'll come round, and under pretence of boarding us for trade,
rush the steamer and murder us. They're real beauties about
her&mdash;half Malay and half devil.'</p>

<p>When we got on deck a screen had been stretched round the
poop, and the awnings were being replaced. Already some canoes
were coming off, and the way they weathered the still turbulent
sea was something wonderful to witness. They were halted, and
told, to stand off, when they came near enough; but they held up
drenched fowls and bunches of bananas as proof of their desire to
trade, and pretended not to understand.</p>

<p>However, a rifle shot made them understand, and they stopped
and commenced sounding with immense long bamboos they had with
them. Evidently, as Paine had said, they were under the
impression that we were aground.</p>

<p>They were anything but handsome fellows, and had long hair
tied back, and hanging down. Their canoes were very 'leaky, and
'one of them was; incessantly employed a baling nut.</p>

<p>The crew went to work's shifting cargo and trimming the ship,
and gradually we got used to the presence of these islanders,
who, with the dogged persistency of the savage, hung around and
occasionally vainly appealed to the two quartermasters who stood
in charge at either gangway.</p>

<p>It must have been nearly eleven o'clock, and we were sitting
on deck yarning and smoking, when there was the report of a
revolver distinctly heard arising from the saloon.</p>

<p>We all went below in a body, and found the stewardess emerging
from her cabin trailing out one of the long bamboos we had seen
the islanders using as sounding poles and which now, it appears,
had a hook on the thin end of it.</p>

<p>The stewardess, when the revolvers were served out, also put
in a claim for one and received one. She was sitting in her
cabin, when to her astonishment a bamboo came through the
porthole, and, as if endued with life, began to wander around
seeking to get the hook, with which it was armed, entangled in
something it could lug out through the port hole.</p>

<p>The stewardess had had some experience in Eastern waters, and
had heard of this harpoon trick; she grasped the bamboo with one
hand and with the other fired her revolver out of the port hole.
This startled the man holding it, and he let go, and she hauled
it in as a trophy of victory. After congratulating her on her
presence of mind, we went on deck again, and found the chief mate
doing a war dance on the quartermasters for allowing a canoe to
sneak up alongside.</p>

<p>There was a very vigilant lookout kept all the remainder of
that day. The crew worked hard, and the sea, too, was rapidly
going down, and we anticipated being under way again by the
morning.</p>

<p>'I thought so,' remarked Paine, about three o'clock; 'we are
in for it with a vengeance this evening.'</p>

<p>I followed the old man's glance, and saw canoes coming from
several points. Evidently a local fiery cross had been sent
round, and allies were hastening from many quarters. It would
take time to make the cargo secure and weigh anchor, and it was
evident that before we could get away the canoes would surround
us.</p>

<p>Paine went forward, and had a yarn with the chief officer and
the chief engineer; then he came back. I noticed as he came along
that there was quite a young look on the man's face, and a fire
in his eye that seemed to tell of a natural love of fighting.</p>

<p>'I'll take charge aft,' he said, in a loud and decided tone;
'I've had a scrap with these coves before.' And we thought it
quite natural that he should; it appeared the man's proper
place.</p>

<p>'Now, these fellows must be cleared out first,' he went on,
'and when the others come up you will have to keep under cover,
and shoot straight, for they will have firearms with them.'</p>

<p>He advanced to the gangway, and hailed the nearest canoe.
However, probably rendered confident by the near approach of
reinforcements, the men refused to move, and one of them called
out something in return. Paine seemed to understand its purport,
for he immediately raised his Martini and fired and the fellow
went headlong over.</p>

<p>'No, no. That's murder!' said a trembling voice beside me, and
looking round I saw a young fellow who was going up as a
missionary to some station In China.</p>

<p>'You had better go below,' said a woman's voice. 'I'll take
your place,' and, to my astonishment, the young fellow took the
advice, and the stewardess, revolver in hand, stepped
forward.</p>

<p>'He has never seen a man shot before,' I said in apology for
him.</p>

<p>'Well, I have,' she returned, 'But I wish these Martinis were
not too heavy for me to use.'</p>

<p>'Bravo!' said my next neighbor, a returning tea merchant.
'We'll beat them off, never fear.'</p>

<p>The boats which had so long surrounded us drew back, on the
man being shot, but the others were close at hand, and their
numbers were considerable. It was a long fight, but if it had not
been for Paine I verily believe they would have got a footing on
the vessel. He was like a darting flame about, and although an
old man in appearance seemed quite a young man again. Every shot
he fired told, and when one canoe was sunk alongside by a heavy
weight, and half a dozen miscreants scrambled on board, he
grappled the leader and fairly threw him back into the sea.</p>

<p>That was the end of it. By this time the stokers had steam up,
the engineers had hot water and steam both trained on the canoes;
and they gave up the attempt to board us, and retreated. But when
I turned round from looking at them I saw Paine lying on the
deck, and the stewardess sitting there at his head with It upon
her lap. In that last grapple he had received a knife thrust from
his foe which was now letting his life out.</p>

<p>The doctor came, but the wound was mortal, and he could do
nothing. Paine was quite resigned, but said that he wanted the
chief officer. That individual left his duties to the second and
came. Whatever was said was whispered in the officer's ear, and
the latter seemed to understand his wishes. Then his mind began
to wander, and he began to talk of strange things, interspersing
his wanderings with scraps of native tongues.</p>

<p>The doctor told us not to move him, and he lay there, with,
his head on the woman's lap, for she obstinately refused to move,
and he babbled himself to his death. Forward the anchor was
coming up, the donkey engine was rattling, and on deck was the
bustle of the ship going on.</p>

<p>Paine raised his head and gazed at the scene.</p>

<p>'Not a bad death for a sailor,' he said to me, as I knelt
beside him. 'And with my head on a brave woman's lap, too! More
than I deserved! Yard arm, or back against a wall was what I
expected!'</p>

<p>Then his eyes glazed, his head fell; back, and life was
over.</p>

<p><br>
TALKING to the chief officer, who was an old friend of mine,
he told me a strange story.</p>

<p>That man,' he said, 'has been dead for years. At least, he was
supposed to have jumped off a Spanish gunboat when in irons, and
gone to the bottom. How it was managed I do not know; but
evidently the yarn is not true, and he escaped somehow, and has
been living in strict retirement ever since. There is no doubt
that he is the right man, I am sure of it; for he gave me
directions about some property in Hongkong. I'll tell you the
name of his partner, and then you'll, know who this man was,' and
he mentioned the name of a notorious scourge of the South
Seas.</p>

<p>'Well!' concluded the mate, 'We gave him a sailor's burial
yesterday, and if he was a desperate villain in his time he was a
splendid fighter.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. &mdash; REFORMATION OF MIVERSON'S PARROT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 13 Mar 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THAT parrot of Miverson's was an example&mdash;a shocking
example; a bird without moral principles or decency of conduct.
This troubled Miverson, who had a sneaking regard for
respectability in spite of his occupation, which was that of a
publican. He had owned the parrot from the time it was a crooning
nestling, and he had purchased it off a blackfellow. It turned
out a wonderful talking bird, and though Miverson tried his best
to keep its tongue in the ways of virtue, the customers and
others led it astray, and it habitually indulged in 'language.'
It was a corella, with an extravagantly hooked beak, and blue
wattles round its eyes, and when excited it could look more
devilish than a nightmare. At last, in spite of Miverson's
efforts, it took to drink.</p>

<p>Rum was its favorite beverage, and if rum was not forthcoming'
when demanded, the place was rendered unbearable with its
devilish yells and cries. It would go to sleep at dark very
drunk, and pass the night muttering strange oaths, and falling
off its perch at intervals. In the morning it would have a head
on it. It was touching to see it standing against the side of its
cage waiting, with its poor sore head resting on the bare, until
some kind soul opened the door of the cage, when it could get
out, clamber on to the bar, and dip its hot beak into something
strong.</p>

<p>The oldest topers used to say that to see that bird throw its
head back and take down its first swallow of rum with a grateful
sigh in the morning was enough to draw tears from a tiger
snake.</p>

<p>Miverson got an idea that the bird's falling away was laid to
his score, and being a good-intentioned man it grieved him very
much. He had been offered large sums for the bird, but refused
them&mdash;first, because he had grown fond of the reprobate, and
next, the bird brought in a good deal of custom.</p>

<p>It was only the small nucleus of a township on the bank of a
river crossing, where Miverson had established his household
gods, but there was a good deal of traffic on the road, and
Miverson's parrot became known far and wide. The opposition house
had vainly endeavored to get up a counter attraction, but without
avail, and any attempt to injure the bird would have raised the
country against the perpetrator of the outrage.</p>

<p>So Miverson's grew and flourished. It was a crowded time at
Miverson's one day. Two or three teams were camped at the river
crossing, and the coach had broken down, and most of its
passengers had to stop overnight, and chose Miverson's. The coach
had brought up news of the Melbourne Cup and the victory of the
favorite, and great was the rejoicing&mdash;so great that it
promised to drink Miverson's dry.</p>

<p>But Miverson's saw it out, and next day the renovated coach
departed, the teams moved on, and stagnation reigned where riot
had just been. Only in Miverson's cash-box was a solid and
satisfactory memento of the late invasion.</p>

<p>Polly Miverson had a very bad head, and he deserved it. The
excitement of the many visitors, and the mixing of drinks, had
been too much for him. He had to use his claw very, very gingerly
indeed when he wanted to scratch his head. He sat on his perch
morosely, regarding the only guest in the place, and occasionally
bidding that individual to go to Sheol.</p>

<p>The only guest was leaning back in the rough chair made of a
sack, and meditatively smoking. He was about 30 years old, not
bad-looking, but with two fatal defects: His eyes were set deep,
and close together, and his beard and whiskers grew unevenly, and
in patches. He was dressed in the usual bush style, so that it
was hard to say what his social rank was. He had been there some
three days spelling his horse, he said, on his way to the little
seaport where the steamers called.</p>

<p>For some strange reason the parrot, who was usually hail
fellow well I met with everybody, refused all friendship with
him, and heartily cursed him whenever he came I near him.</p>

<p>The evening closed in wet and gloomy, and the inhabitants of
the little cluster of houses by the side of the river betook
themselves to bed early. Ah Sin, the Chinese cook at Miverson's,
had gone with some other of his countrymen to have a quiet
all-night gamble at the gardener's. The knockabout man, who had
won 2 over the Cup, and got happy, had gone to rest in a retired
lean-to against the stable; Miverson was making up his books, and
the and the solitary lodger were alone in the house.</p>

<p>The traveller yawned over a tattered yellowback. Once or twice
he wandered to the bar and invited the landlord to drink with
him, but Miverson was a temperate man, and did not respond very
genially, being anxious to get his work done and retire to bed.
At last the man went to his room, mine host shut his books, and
closed the bar, and all was dark and silent save for the heavy
downpour of rain upon the roof.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when the traveller, who had not
undressed, stole out of his room and listened attentively. All
was still but for the steady patter. The man, who had surveyed
his ground before, unclosed the back door and sneaked out. The
room where the landlord slept opened out of the bar. To reach it
from inside the bar door and bedroom door would have to be broken
open, and the man thought that the roughly-shuttered window
opening into the back verandah would prove the easiest mode of
entrance. Twice he had been within an ace of bailing Miverson up
behind the bar when he called him out to have a drink; but a man
had been hanged at Brisbane not many years before for failing to
stick up a bank properly, and his courage had failed him.</p>

<p>Softly he crept round to the window, and commenced operations.
Everything was in his favor&mdash;the falling rain, and the dark
night, broken only now and again by a flash of lightning. He
worked noiselessly, and soon worked the bolt of the ill-fitting,
shutter back with his sheath-knife and had the shutter open.</p>

<p>All was easy now. Miverson had been kept up all the night
before by his noisy guests and slept heavily. The cash-box, as
the man knew, was in a box under the bed&mdash;one that could be
carried out and opened at leisure. He got skilfully and
noiselessly into the room. Soft as a cat he felt for the box,
listening to the heavy breathing of the sleeper as he did so, and
had taken the box out and made one step towards the window when a
sleepy voice said somewhat huskily:</p>

<p>'You damned thief!'</p>

<p>The parrot, who always slept in the room, was I only muttering
in his uneasy dreams, but it was enough to startle the nerves of
the intruder. With a start he nearly dropped the box, but managed
to let it on to the ground with a good deal of noise.</p>

<p>'Who's there?' cried Miverson, sitting up. A quavering flash
of lightning illuminated the room, and the men saw each other,
and the thief saw that Miverson's hand was under the pillow as if
feeling for a revolver. There was no time to be lost. His life
was forfeit, and drawing his sheath-knife the robber sprang on
his opponent and stabbed recklessly and furiously. Scream after
scream suddenly came from the startled bird. When a parrot is
properly scared at can make as much noise as a terrified woman,
and mad with the rage of murder and baffled purpose, the thief
tore the cage open and dragged the shrieking bird out to silence
it. In the darkness he did not get hold of it property, and the
bird, savagely biting, escaped from him and flew through the open
window, still screaming like an avenging fiend, and disappeared
in the storm.</p>

<p>Impelled by wild fear, the man followed, and when help arrived
they only found the bleeding body on the bed. Some life was left
in it, which was nursed back before morning, and they took down
what they thought would prove his dying deposition. It did not,
however.</p>

<p>Miverson eventually recovered, to live a life-long invalid. In
the morning the river was flooded, and all the anxious tracking
that was undertaken by black and white did not reveal any clue as
to the course taken toy the murderer. Two of the searchers, a
black and a white one, were, busy scouring the bush, when they
were startled by the same wild screams that had rung out and
frightened the sleepers. The parrot came to them. They took it
home, but from that time the bird, although it recovered from its
fright, never spoke, and refused all offers of its once favorite
refreshment. Whether the would-be murderer escaped or died in the
bush, the people of the little cluster of settlement never knew
for long years.</p>

<p>Miverson had a brother down south who came up, and looked
after the business until he was able to leave, when he sold cut
and left the district, taking the parrot who had saved his money.
With him, and the superstitious people persisted in the story
that the mark of the murderous hand upon his breast never died
out.</p>

<p>Every time the bird moulted it was renewed, so they
avowed.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
MISS Dare, the daughter of one of the wealthiest men about
Brookstone, was locally considered equal to any professional
beauty that the world could bring forward. Unfortunately, she was
of the same opinion herself in consequence of the spoiling
process she had undergone, which rendered her a rather
disagreeable person, not very popular amongst the other girls. In
reality she was a pretty woman, with a weak, silly head.</p>

<p>She was an only daughter; and old Dare, who had been one of
the original settlers of Brookstone, was believed to be able to
leave her something warm. Consequently she was much courted, and
led to imagine that she had the Australian world at her feet.</p>

<p>Brookstone was in a state of mild excitement just at this
time. Reefing had been discovered in the neighborhood, and the
traffic in shares had for a time run high. Finally it settled
down into one or two paying mines, and several doubtful ones.</p>

<p>To one of these doubtful ones came a new manager, who was
going to make things hum generally. He talked glibly, and with
much apparent knowledge, of the wonderful new process about to be
started, of the elaborate machinery about to be erected, of the
mistakes made by former managers by which one of the best-paying
mines in Australia had been left undeveloped, and of the great
future that lay ahead.</p>

<p>Shares rose, and amongst those to invest largely was old Dare.
Dare was noted as a cautious man, and others followed his
example; so that things looked up with the 'Purse of Fortune.'
Dare and Hollingshed, the new manager, became what is known as
thick as thieves, and the now popular Hollingshed rode and drove
with Miss Dare when not engaged in his mining duties, to the
envy, hatred, and malice of all the other suitors. There were not
wanting seme to say that the wonderful new process was only a
very old one, better known as blow, unlimited blow; but these
were said to be men who had failed in getting cheap shares. At
last it was rumored that Hollingshed had carried off the beauty
and heiress&mdash;he was engaged to Miss Dare.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mine exhibited no very great progress in the
shape of development. It was bruited about everywhere that the
proprietors were only waiting for the arrival of the new and
expensive machinery from England, and some visitors from
Melbourne and a champagne chivoo on the ground served to fully
restore public confidence.</p>

<p>The marriage day was fixed, and there was to be a great
celebration on the occasion, as the local paper said of 'Mr.
Hollingshed, the popular manager of the "Purse of Fortune," and
the lovely and accomplished daughter of our esteemed, townsman
Mr. John Dare becoming united.'</p>

<p>The day approached as days generally do if one waits long
enough, and amid much health-drinking, congratulation, and all
the rest of it the daughter of our esteemed townsman was married
to the popular manager. The happy couple were to go to Sydney for
their honeymoon, and by the time they returned the 'new and
expensive machinery' would be on the ground, and the golden
stream would commence to flow.</p>

<p>'Don't be surprised, my dear fellow,' said the manager to the
editor of the local paper in strict confidence, 'if there should
be a fall in 'Fortunes.' Our people want to get as many shares as
they can into their own hands. They are going to put a lot of
shares on the market to bring down the price a bit, and then buy
in again. An old dodge, you know. Don't you be frightened, but
just hold on like grim death.'</p>

<p>'Trust me,' said the editor, with a wink born of
champagne.</p>

<p>Then they started to drive thirty miles to the town, where
they would take the train for Sydney, and papa Dare was to join
them in a day or two. The new Mrs. Hollingshed found her husband
in high spirits as they drove along the country road. They had
arranged to stop for an hour or two at a pretty little township
nestling in a farming district, about half way.</p>

<p>There was a decent sort of public house there, where the bride
had stayed once before, and found everything very comfortable.
They drove into the stable yard, and the horses were taken out
and given a feed. The bride went to her room with a maid, and
Hollingshed strolled into the quiet bar for a drink, the
breakfast champagne requiring a little freshening up after the
drive. It was a peaceful little place, more like a country inn in
Europe than in a bush township in New South Wales. A sleek cat
was asleep on the counter, a white parrot dozing in a cage, and a
pleasant-faced girl came forward to serve him.</p>

<p>'Have you some good whisky?' asked the mining manager, with
his persuasive, killing smile.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' replied the girl, putting the required article
down. Hollingshed helped himself, and commenced a conversation in
the intervals of lighting a cigar. Suddenly the quiet was broken
by a succession of piercing shrieks. The parrot was clinging to
the bars of his cage as though he would tear them apart. His
wings beating furiously the while, he poured forth shrill screams
mingled with oaths and curses. So violent was its rage that its
body seemed suddenly animated by a devil.</p>

<p>Aghast the girl stared at him, murmuring, 'Uncle Dick's dumb
parrot!'</p>

<p>Hollingshed dropped his cigar, and looked with a white face at
the accusing bird. His hand trembled as he clutched the bar, and
he cried out as if in spite of himself, 'Miverson's parrot!'</p>

<p>What passed through his mind? He saw a blood-stained figure
prone on the bed, illumined by a flash of white light. He saw a
barefooted, hunted fugitive fleeing through the bush amid storm
and tempest, with the same shrieks ringing in his ears. He saw
the same starved wanderer alone, shrinking from the night and the
blackness, and always pursued by a white, shrieking spirit with a
bloody brand on its breast. He saw the same wanderer come to an
out station with a pitiful tale of losing his horse and
everything he had in the flood, and being taken in and fed! Now,
when he saw money before him, and had just married, was it all to
be dashed from his grasp by an accusing and avenging sprite in
the shape of a wretched bird?</p>

<p>The mad, blind rage he felt once more came over him. He would
have sprung on the bird, and torn it to pieces, but another voice
was heard. In the doorway behind the bar stood a stooping figure,
pale and thin, the ghost of Miverson.</p>

<p>'Uncle! uncle!' cried the girl. 'Your parrot's gone mad!'</p>

<p>The bird ceased its clamor when it heard its master's voice;
but still flapped its wings and beat against the wires.</p>

<p>'The parrot suddenly shrieked out at this gentleman,' the girl
explained to her uncle.</p>

<p>The ghost of Miverson directed his lack-lustre gaze on their
visitor. Four long years had passed since the two men had
confronted each other. The recognition was mutual. Miverson's
eyes blazed up.</p>

<p>'You villain! At last! at last!' he cried. 'Lucy! quick! Call
your father!'</p>

<p>Hollingshed stood his ground. Flight would have been fatal;
his best game was to treat the whole thing with contempt.</p>

<p>'That's the man who tried to rob and murder me,' said Miverson
to his brother when he came.</p>

<p>'Why, that's the manager of the new mine up at
Brookstone.'</p>

<p>'So I am,' broke in Hollingshed, 'what's up with this old
lunatic?'</p>

<p>'That's him right enough,' said another voice, that of the old
knockabout whom Miverson had brought down with him out of
charity.</p>

<p>The police station was but a few steps away, and Hollingshed
found himself in an awkward fix. His bluff about being a mining
manager did not arouse much sympathy as a guarantee of
respectability. Miverson Brothers were well known and respected;
the case had been much talked of at the time, and the policeman
had the details that were forwarded of the missing man at the
time. He felt justified in arresting him on suspicion.</p>

<p>When the bride descended she found that the bridegroom was in
custody. As he had left the bar in company with the policeman the
girl looked at the cage and gave a cry. The parrot was lying on
its back, stone dead.</p>

<p>A great surprise awaited the people of Brookstone. The shares
of the 'Fortune' certainly fell, and they did not recover again.
The shares put upon the market belonged to Dare, Hollingshed, and
his partner&mdash;a seedy agent in Melbourne. The new and
expensive machinery, needless to say, did not turn up. No more
did our esteemed townsman, John Dare, in Brookstone. His property
was mortgaged to the hilt, and he left his creditors lamenting.
Hollingshed was passed over to the Queensland police, tried, and
got seven years. The poor beauty of the district will, doubtless,
get a divorce under the act.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. &mdash; RECORD OF A HOMICIDE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 30 July 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
'THIS is a lively lookout,' said Barnlow to his partner as
they sat in the verandah, and meditatively smoked while they
watched a red hot sun go down. 'Cook down with Gulf fever,
Thomson with sandy blight, and you've got the blue devils.
Nothing to eat but salt beef and the usual accompaniments, and
nothing to do till we get some rain.'</p>

<p>'Which apparently is as far off as ever. Why don't you run
over and see Burrows, he's always good company for a day or
two.'</p>

<p>'I've a jolly good mind to; but it looks mean to go away, and
leave you all alone.'</p>

<p>'Don't mind me; I'm more used to it than you. Get away
to-morrow in the cool, and come back at the end of the week.
I'll doctor the fellows.'</p>

<p>Barnlow looked half persuaded.</p>

<p>'We can't both go, and if you won't, I will, I think.'</p>

<p>'That's right. I'll amuse myself blessing the clerk of the
weather and the mortgagees. We've about come to the end of our
tether; and I expect the bank will send a man up soon.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and the day after we give delivery, it will rain cats
and dogs, and there'll be three good seasons straight on
end.'</p>

<p>Langdon grunted assent, and Barnlow, who seemed to have
cheered up somewhat under the prospect of a visit to their
neighbor, whose spirits were notoriously irrepressible, went out
to give the sick cook his quinine, and doctored the other man's
eyes.</p>

<p>A black gin appeared with their tasteless fare of dried salt
beef, bread, and tea, placed it on the table, and lit a kerosene
lamp. The mosquitoes came in with a rush, and Langdon got wearily
up, and went into their living room. Barnlow soon returned with
the welcome intelligence that the cook was better, and thought he
would be able to get about to-morrow.</p>

<p>The two sat down to their meal, and two or three hungry dogs
looked in at the door, and seemed to reproachfully intimate that
it was a long while since last killing time.</p>

<p>'You will, be able to manage if you kill tomorrow, if Jack can
knock about?' asked Barnlow.</p>

<p>'Yes. Wellington and I can manage whether or no.'</p>

<p>Wellington, which was the heroic name bestowed on the black
boy, just then pattered along the verandah with his bare
feet.</p>

<p>'Mine think it Marmee come up,' he said.</p>

<p>Wellington had been in the native police, and Marmee is the
usual term they apply to their officers.</p>

<p>'All right,' said Barnlow, as they rose from the table; 'you
tell Bathsheba to put the billy on, and make some more tea.'</p>

<p>Wellington, who was the worser half of Bathsheba, the gin who
acted as temporary cook, retired, and the two men went outside to
await the coming of the sub-inspector. He rode up with one boy
with him, and was greeted by the partners; as a welcome
guest.</p>

<p>'Come in, Whitlaw; the boys will look after the horses, though
you might as well put them in the yard for all the feed there is
about,' said Barnlow.</p>

<p>'Where are you off to?' asked Langdon.</p>

<p>'Up to see Burrows; he made me promise a month or two ago to
come up and stay a week. You fellows coming?'</p>

<p>'Barnlow will go over with you to-morrow; I can't get
away.'</p>

<p>'Come on man, Burrows will be fearfully disappointed; he's had
a case of whisky planted somewhere for the last three months;
that is, if he has not broken his solemn vow, and broached
it.'</p>

<p>'You can get through it without me; or you're not Gulf men.
What's the news? Seen anybody lately?'</p>

<p>'Not a soul. People don't knock about much when there's
neither grass nor water.'</p>

<p>'Hanged if there will be anybody left to knock about, soon,'
said Barnlow, 'if this weather keeps on much longer.'</p>

<p>Here Bathsheba came in with a fresh supply of tea, and Whitlaw
sat down at the table, and commenced to eat.</p>

<p>'By Jove, I quite forgot,' he said, jumping up again. 'I
brought some papers over with me, they're pretty old, but that
can't be helped.'</p>

<p>He went into the verandah, and took some newspapers from his
saddle pouch. He sat down, and chatted with Barnlow, while
Langdon opened, and looked at the papers.</p>

<p>'Seems to have been plenty of suicides lately; there's a deuce
of a lot about some Melbourne one.'</p>

<p>'Yes; it's highly sensational. Fellow with plenty of coin, and
happily married, as far as is known, blew his brains out. Last
man expected.'</p>

<p>'Couldn't have had many to blow out,' said Barnlow. 'Now if he
had to run a cattle station up here, through two droughts with
the bank writing to you every mail, to reduce your overdraft,
there would be nothing to wonder at. But in Melbourne, with
plenty of coin, I don't see the necessity.'</p>

<p>'It's an old affair revived it seems,' said Langdon. 'Somebody
says he has seen the man since, and that he never committed
suicide at all.'</p>

<p>'What's the lunatic's name?'</p>

<p>'Whitby.'</p>

<p>'Then who was the man who blew his brains out?'</p>

<p>'That's what they want to find out,' said Whitlaw. 'The body
had been lying in a patch of scrub outside Melbourne somewhere on
some vacant ground. It was identified by the general appearance,
clothes, and contents of the pockets. The face was frightfully
disfigured. Now, after the body has been buried three weeks, an
intimate friend of Whitby's swears positively that he saw the
supposed suicide alive and well. That he tried to interview him,
but the fellow got away.'</p>

<p>'When did this happen?'</p>

<p>'Nearly three months ago, by the dates.'</p>

<p>The men talked and killed, mosquitoes viciously for some time,
and then sought refuge in their nets to toss through the hot,
windless night.</p>

<p>In the morning everybody was awake early, and they were soon
off, to take advantage of all the cool they could get.</p>

<p>Shortly after 12 o'clock Langdon and Wellington came back with
a few head of cattle, and yarded them. Langdon lay down on his
bunk, and picked up one of the papers brought by Whitlaw the
night before. He ran his eyes carelessly over it, when a
paragraph that had escaped him suddenly awoke him out of the
listlessness that oppressed him.</p>

<p>'That Sensational Suicide' it was headed. 'It is not generally
known,' it ran on, 'that the name of the alleged suicide, whose
identity is causing so much sensational interest was formerly
Seymour. Just before coming to Victoria he inherited considerable
property conditionally on taking the name of Whitby. This fact,
which has not been made public before, may, perhaps, lead to some
clues as to the true nature of this extraordinary affair. At
present the mystery is as unfathomable as ever. The exhuming or
the body led to nothing, and we are no nearer finding out whether
it was an unaccountable murder or an equally unaccountable
suicide.'</p>

<p>Langdon got up, and walked out on the verandah with the paper
in his hand. Seymour! Could it possibly be the same man? The name
was a pretty common one. He looked again to see if the initials
had been given anywhere. Yes; there they were&mdash;C.F. Whitby,
that would be formerly C.F. Seymour, or Charles Fairfield
Seymour. The man he hated so, and with such just cause.</p>

<p>He walked up and down, pondering it all over. This man had
once been his close friend, until he came to know the hidden
villainy of his nature&mdash;came to feel the almost reasonless
malignity of his actions. Dark hints and suspicions used to be
current that Seymour must be irresponsible. That no man could act
the open-hearted, generous friend like he did, and yep could at
the same time be a relentless enemy from mere perverse impish
deviltry. All the black stories that had been whispered about
Seymour came back to his memory, and proved to him beyond doubt
that it was the same man, and that this was some devilish plot of
his warped brain that ordinary men could not conceive
possible.</p>

<p>He felt convinced that it was not suicide, but some ghastly,
treacherous murder, and that this mad homicide was at large
chuckling over the idea of being thought dead.</p>

<p>Who was his wife? Was it possible that his arts had succeeded,
and that the woman who should have been his own wife had married
Seymour? Seven years ago exactly&mdash;seven years that very
month&mdash;he and she had parted, sundered by some secret
treachery that he could not fathom. Since then he had cut himself
off from all associations with the past, and lived the rough
pioneering life or the north. Seymour must have married the girl
he still loved, and this atrocious act was a scheme of lingering
hatred and vengeance against both.</p>

<p>He looked through the papers carefully to see if there was any
reference to the supposed widow; but, beyond a statement that she
was living in strict seclusion, there was none. Langdon spent a
restless afternoon thinking&mdash;thinking of all the
possibilities of the future, if Seymour, of Whitby, was really
dead things might disentangle themselves.</p>

<p>The loss of the station would not leave him altogether
penniless, and he would learn from his old sweetheart what the
truth really had been. If Whitby was alive, why, there was
trouble ahead.</p>

<p>Just before sundown he went up to the yard to kill. As he
pulled the trigger, and the beast dropped he could not help
thinking that it was a pity that it was not Seymour's devilish,
scheming brain that got the bullet.</p>

<p><br>
THE unexpected thunderbolt fell. The bank foreclosed, and
Barnlow agreed to manage for them. This suited Langdon exactly,
and it was not long before he was on-board a steamer, speeding
south.</p>

<p>The two stood talking in the house to which the supposed widow
had retired. All the black cunning and villainy that had parted
them had been cleared away, and they could now speak freely.</p>

<p>'Lawrence,' she said, 'I am convinced that he is alive, and
watching me to torture me in some way. If you only knew what I
have been through. From almost the moment we were married he
showed his real character, and threw off that veneer he could
assume so easily, and which deceived everybody. How he used to
torture me! Any pet animal, or pet bird of mine, he would take
and deliberately torment and kill before my eyes. He told me that
he only sought me in marriage because he could make my life
wretched, and perhaps send you to the dogs. All the venomous hate
of his nature seemed concentrated on us two and his brother.'</p>

<p>'I didn't know he had a brother.'</p>

<p>'Yes, a year younger and as bad as himself. Lawrence, I firmly
believe that was the brother whose body was found.'</p>

<p>'Did he murder him, do you think?'</p>

<p>'Heaven knows. They were both mad&mdash;the worst kind of
madmen, who could hide their madness and walk about amongst their
fellow-men and play their wicked pranks with impunity. Sometimes
he could not keep his madness under, and would break and destroy
and shatter things when the fit came on. He never touched me
strange to say. I think he knew that if he laid his hand on me
the fury of his hate would overpower him and he could not have
helped murdering me.'</p>

<p>'Have you any children?' asked Langdon.</p>

<p>'One boy. Thank God, he died when he was 3 years old.'</p>

<p>Langdon looked inquiringly at her.</p>

<p>'He was an idiot. Can you wonder at it. If he had lived, his
wretched life would have been passed in restraint.'</p>

<p>'What happened the last time you saw him?'</p>

<p>'He had just had one of his violent fits of rage. I had locked
myself in my room. Presently he came and demanded admittance. His
voice sounded more composed, and I opened the door. He looked at
me viciously for some time. Then he said: "I'm going out. I must
kill something to-night. If I stop here I might kill you, and I
don't want to yet. Not yet; you've not been wretched enough, yet.
Besides, I want to Kill Langdon first. Perhaps I might kill
myself; I don't know. If I don't come back you'll know that I
have taken my own life." He rambled on like this for some time,
always talking about killing something. He often went on this way
when he was sure we were alone, because he knew how it frightened
me. You know how rational and quiet he could always be when
others were within hearing. I did not put much stress on his
words, as I was only anxious he should go before he worked
himself up to another dangerous fit. At last he went down to the
hall, put on his overcoat and hat, lit a cigar, and went quietly
out with a smiling face. I have not seen him alive since.'</p>

<p>'And that body?'</p>

<p>'Had on the clothes, and as far as one could judge, resembled
him. But, Lawrence, he never killed himself. It's some cunning
trick. He wants to keep me in uncertainty and doubt. Perhaps
thinks that I may forget, and believe him dead; then he will
suddenly appear again, and crush me.'</p>

<p>'Have you seen his brother?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he is very like Fairfield, both in appearance and voice.
But he is not so restless, and, he drinks.'</p>

<p>'And you say they hated each other.'</p>

<p>'I don't know about Herbert. They both had the same madness of
abusing everybody and everything, but when we were alone
Fairfield used to give vent to terrible expressions of hate
against Herbert, although when together he was as smiling and
pleasant as he used to be to everyone. Often I thought that I
might be able to get him confined, but no one would have believed
me. No one. How could they be expected to.'</p>

<p>'How are you off?' 'Fortunately, I have my own money, which he
could not touch. As for his property, his lawyers are looking to
that.'</p>

<p>'If he is alive, do you think that he murdered this
brother?'</p>

<p>'I must think so.'</p>

<p>'Where was he supposed to be?'</p>

<p>'In West Australia. But his movements were uncertain.'</p>

<p>They, were standing by the French light opening on the garden,
and the dusky shadows were gathering fast. He took her hand to
say farewell.</p>

<p>'I see nothing for it but to wait; he'll betray himself before
long, or if he is really dead his brother may turn up. For myself
I shall go up country again. We had better be apart.'</p>

<p>She lifted a sad, wistful face towards his. In the dim
twilight he could see the tears in her eyes, and he bent his head
downward and kissed her. Suddenly she started back with a faint
shriek.</p>

<p>'Look there! Look there! What is that?'</p>

<p>He wheeled round, but the garden seemed tenantless and
silent.</p>

<p>'What was it?' he asked.</p>

<p>'A man's figure. It stood there on the grass for a moment, and
seemed to dance and jump with joy.'</p>

<p>She had covered her face with her hands, and was trembling
violently.</p>

<p>Langdon went and searched the garden, but without avail.</p>

<p>'Was it Fairfield?' he asked, when he came back.</p>

<p>'I don't know; it was like a devil rejoicing over some
wickedness.'</p>

<p>'Is it safe for you here?'</p>

<p>'I think I'll go to a friend's house to-night; there are only
two women in the house.'</p>

<p>'Do so; write to me. But I won't see you again until I have
found this mystery out It is better and safer for you.'</p>

<p>Langdon went home convinced that the supposed suicide had
actually been a diabolical fratricide. The madman's brain had
evolved what he thought an exquisite scheme of cruelty, which his
old sweetheart could not well put in plain words. Thinking him
dead, they might come together again, and marry. Then he would
appear on the scene.</p>

<p>Whether the murder of his brother had been planned or
circumstances had played into Whitby's hands could not then be
determined. He must run him to earth, if he was to have any
future peace&mdash;hunt him down, and consign him either to the
gallows or the criminal lunatic asylum. Several times he cast
wary looks behind him. If the figure Mrs. Whitby had seen in the
garden was in truth her husband, he might be following him with
homicidal intent; but he reached his hotel in safety.</p>

<p><br>
SIX months passed slowly. Langdon had gone back to the bush
again, having fruitlessly wasted some time in trying to satisfy
himself as to whether Whitby was alive or dead. Both to him and
the police it was still a matter of doubt. Business had taken
Langdon once again to the Gulf country of Northern Queensland,
and having some time at his disposal he employed it in paying a
visit to his old friend and partner Barnlow, now managing their
old station for the bank.</p>

<p>There was a short cut across country, which would lessen the
journey a good deal, and he took it, anticipating striking a
waterhole near the boundary of their former run, where he could
camp for the night. It was a lonely lagoon surrounded by poor,
scrubby country, and had a bad name from two teamsters having
been murdered by the blacks there in the early days. An old road,
now disused for years, ran by it.</p>

<p>Langdon reached the spot just as the sun set, and saw to his
surprise a light smoke rising on the opposite side. Blacks he
thought, and rode to the edge to give his horses a drink, keeping
his eyes about him as they put their heads down. The blacks were
no longer considered dangerous, but as yet they could not be
thoroughly trusted.</p>

<p>He saw a bough-shed, and by its appearance judged that it was
the work of some wandering white traveller, who had chosen this
secluded spot to spell in for a few days. His horses having drank
their full, he, rode round, and approached the bough-shelter. He
dismounted, and walked up to it. Someone was inside, so engrossed
in writing, stooping over his knees, and scribbling by the fading
light, that he did not see his visitor.</p>

<p>'Good evening,' said Langdon.</p>

<p>The occupant started, and gave a loud cry of startled terror,
then jumping to his feet stared at Langdon with blazing eyes. It
was Whitby without doubt&mdash;Whitby with his insanity now fully
developed, and past all disguising, lurking here in concealment
like a hunted beast.</p>

<p>Before Langdon could, make a move the maniac sprang at him
with a snarl of rage. Down they went&mdash;Langdon fighting for
his life, and the other with a madman's strength. Grappling and
struggling they rolled down the bank into the lagoon, and Langdon
got the upper hand, and desperately tried to hold the other's
head under the water. They splashed and fought amongst the
clinging leaves by the water lilies, but Langdon managed to
retain his advantage, and at last the other, half drowned and
beaten, ceased to resist.</p>

<p>Langdon dragged him to the bank, and let him lie there; while
he regained his own breath. But the maniac did not stop quiet
long. Suddenly he sprang up, and evading his enemy's grasp, fled
down the edge of the lagoon into the darkling shadows of the
scrub. Pursuit was useless, nor was Langdon in a position to
pursue.</p>

<p>He caught his horses, and determined to ride on to the
station, fourteen miles away, and procure help. He was about to
mount when he remembered the occupation of the man when he
arrived, and went into the bough-shed, and picked up the book
from the ground. It was a fair-sized <i>'Lett's Diary</i>,' and
probably contained some horrible secrets set down by the madman's
hand. He mounted and rode, away, hearing as he did a long, dismal
howl arise behind him; but whether it came from the throat of a
human being or a wild dog he could not say.</p>

<p>It was midnight when he rode up to the station, and a sleepy
voice called out from the interior and demanded to know who it
was. Barnlow's surprise was great at greeting his old friend, and
he hastily helped him to unsaddle.</p>

<p>'Whitlaw's here,' he said; 'seems quite a coincidence. By the
way, will you have a nip, old fellow; we haven't finished it all,
thank goodness?'</p>

<p>'Will I have a nip? Yes; about five fingers! I've been
half-murdered at the old road lagoon, and am wet through.'</p>

<p>Barnlow hurried his preparations, and Whitlaw came out to
welcome him. When Langdon had got into dry things he told his
wondering listeners his story: 'I must read this before I can
sleep. Heaven knows what crime he has since committed to be
hiding there,' he said as he finished his tale.</p>

<p>'Strikes me,' returned Whitlaw, 'that he was on the lookout
for you. He probably does not know that the station has changed
hands, and came up here to watch for you.'</p>

<p>'That must be it.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you are going to sit up, call us before daylight,
and we'll make an early start. It's evidently my duty, even
without special orders, to capture homicidal maniacs who are
wandering about loose.'</p>

<p>They went to bed and left Langdon to his task of deciphering
the madman's diary.</p>

<p>It took Langdon the remaining hours of the night to decipher
the diary, which had evidently been written at various times, and
in various degrees of legibility. The confession, for it was
nothing else, ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
AS long as I can remember I have felt a hatred to every living
thing in the world. As a child I used to vent it on all things
that came in my power. Kittens and puppies and all the pets that
children generally have had to be kept out of my reach, for I
always hated them in some way. My mother could not conceal her
horror of me, and as I grew up, and understood things, I began to
see that people avoided me, and I overheard them say I was
mad.</p>

<p>Then I began to think and talk with my brother about this. He
was of the same temper as myself, and we hated each other; but I
felt that he was with me against the rest of the world. We saw
that we must hide the feelings we entertained, or there was
danger of our being put in confinement. So from that out we were
cunning enough to keep our hatred of things to ourselves. One
person we never deceived, and that was our mother.</p>

<p>Our father died when we were boys. I and my brother stole into
the room where his dead body lay during the absence of everybody.
He had often chastised me for my cruelty, and I mocked him as he
lay there motionless&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why don't you get up and punish me!' I said as I struck the
dead face again and again, and my brother laughed.</p>

<p>A scream of horror disturbed us, and looking round we saw our
mother staring at us. From that day she kept her room until death
came after years of lingering illness. Her last words, an urgent
prayer that we should not be allowed to come near her dead body.
One day my brother and I were walking by the side of a canal,
when a boy came along the towing path, a little fellow, whistling
as he came along. We accosted him, and began to tease him. He
took it very good-naturedly until I proposed to throw him in the
water. Then he was frightened.</p>

<p>'Doant 'ee do it, masters!' he pleaded; 'I bain't able to
swim.'</p>

<p>We threw him in, and delightedly watched his struggles as he
drowned. Once he nearly gained the bank: but I pushed him out
again, and he sank. His body was found, but it was thought that
he had fallen in. When my brother was of age he was a year
younger than I the property that we inherited was divided between
us, and we went our different ways.</p>

<p>I had now succeeded in concealing my real feelings towards my
fellow-creatures, and found most exquisite joy in acting the
hypocrite, and only giving vent to my passion when it was quite
safe to do so.</p>

<p>I met Margaret Campbell and Langdon on the same day. The girl
attracted me strangely, and first made me think of marriage. I
saw there was a great capacity for suffering in her nature, and
it occurred to me that a wife whom I could torture with impunity
in my own way, and before whom I need not go to the trouble of
hiding my real nature, would be a great pleasure. But it was
evident that an engagement was pending between her and Langdon,
and I saw that I could have a great deal of diversion in breaking
it off. I was much troubled by a girl at the time.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of a widow who lived in that part of the
country, and being without protection, her mother being an
invalid, she had easily been fooled and made my victim. Now she
had become troublesome. I received a desperate letter from her,
threatening suicide if I would not save her from disgrace. I made
an appointment to meet her, and her body was found in the river a
day or two afterwards, and in her pocket was the incriminating
letter; but it was addressed to Langdon, not to me.</p>

<p>The plan succeeded admirably. The rumor soon reached Miss
Campbell that Langdon was morally responsible for the girl's
suicide. The fools thought it was suicide; but the girl might
have been alive now if she had consented to act as my tool in the
matter. But it was better as it was. She would never be able to
betray me, dead; while she might have repented if alive.</p>

<p>Naturally I was very indignant at Langdon being
accused&mdash;vowed it was a plot to ruin him, and defended him
in the most generous way&mdash;so much so that he himself
suspected my genuineness in the matter. I protested too much, and
from what he heard&mdash;for, of course, many inquisitive, prying
busybodies knew that I was in the habit of meeting the
girl&mdash;I think the whole plot became patent to him, and very
foolishly he declared his open belief that I was the guilty
party. Nor did he hesitate to express his doubts about it being a
case of suicide.</p>

<p>Of course, he could not prove anything in support of his
wicked charges, and everybody was indignant with the black
ingratitude of his conduct. Miss Campbell was especially
disgusted with him, and Langdon left England. Now was my
opportunity, and I advanced my cause so well that we were
married. Before our honeymoon was over I had told her of the
cunning contrivance by which I had blackened and banished
Langdon.</p>

<p>This was the commencement of our married bliss. Then there was
that brat. How I did love to make that imp shriek and rave in its
idiot fury, while she begged and entreated me to desist! The
whelp died, and the mother was relieved. Then I remembered
Langdon, and I determined to come out to Australia in the hope of
meeting him, as I heard that that was the country he had gone
to.</p>

<p>I took a house in Melbourne, and as, fortunately, just before
I left England a relation died, and left me a sum of money
provided I assumed his name, it was under a different name I was
known in this country. This suited me, as Langdon would not
recognise it. But I could hear nothing of him.</p>

<p>Who should I meet in Australia but my brother, who had been
wandering in many parts of the world. He came to see us several
times, and one, evening, when my wife happened to remark upon the
resemblance between us, a glorious thought flashed through my
brain. I did not see the beauty of the scheme at first, but
gradually it dawned upon me better, than I had at first
conceived.</p>

<p>Some days afterwards I put it into execution.</p>

<p>I went out with Herbert to a lonely piece of scrub on some
waste ground. I told him what my scheme was, and he was delighted
at the idea&mdash;that is, at the way I put it to him. I told him
that it had long been my purpose to commit suicide; that my
constant fear was that in some unguarded moment I should do
something which would bring me to the gallows, and that I had
determined to take my own life. I proposed to him that, taking
advantage of our close resemblance, we should exchange clothes,
and then I would shoot myself. He could go back and personate
me.</p>

<p>He grasped the idea in all its ingenuity, and agreed to it at
once. He had no pity for me, the brute, so I had none for him. He
talked of the fun he would have acting as myself.</p>

<p>'Don't trouble, old fellow,' he said; 'I'll sustain the
reputation of the family!'</p>

<p>We went into all the details of the matter, and arranged
everything to our mutual satisfaction. How I enjoyed the fool's
prattle! He little thought what was coming! We changed our
garments, and Herbert kept recalling old times.</p>

<p>'How that boy gasped and choked in the canal! But you might
have let him out, Fairfield.'</p>

<p>'Oh, come now!' I answered. 'It was your proposal.'</p>

<p>'Yes. But I never killed a girl like you did.'</p>

<p>'I expect you have, if the truth were known.'</p>

<p>'Well, it does not matter now. Are you ready?'</p>

<p>'Directly! You're in a mighty hurry!'</p>

<p>'Don't shoot yourself in the face. I saw a man shot there in
Africa, and he didn't look pretty.'</p>

<p>'Whereabouts was it?' I had taken out my revolver, and was
carelessly handling it.</p>

<p>'Just there,' he said, indicating the bridge of his nose. 'The
bullet traveled upwards through his brain.'</p>

<p>'Like that,' I replied, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Naturally, he didn't answer, but fell dead, and put the
revolver Into his hand, which still moved convulsively, and left
him. I went to his hotel, paid his account, everybody taking me
for Herbert, and went away to wait until the body was found. I
had talked to Margaret about suicide before leaving her, and
there was no question of my death when the corpse was at last
discovered. Like a fool, I went back to Melbourne again without
taking the trouble at disguising myself in any way, and met a
friend, but though I managed to avoid him. I have seen by the
papers he recognised me. I must take greater care. It wouldn't do
to be hanged for Herbert.</p>

<p>At last Langdon has turned up, and my plot works. It was a
clever plot, after all. I saw them standing together at the
window, and he kissed her. They will marry; and then? I have
found out where Langdon is. He has a station in the north of
Queensland. He must have gone there, for I have not seen him
since. If he does not come quick I must pay him a visit. I can't
wait long, or I shall kill her; I know it.</p>

<p>This is a nice quiet place. A man can be free here, and shout
with joy, without people saying he is mad. It was hard work to
get here quietly without being suspected. It was awful on that
steamer with the song of the machinery going all night. Beating
out a rhyme that never stopped; that made you listen, listen, and
think of all the things you could do. But Langdon must be killed
first. To-morrow I will go to the station. How Margaret will cry
when I go down and tell her he is dead, dead, and I shall stamp
and spit on his face tomorrow....</p>

<p><br>
THIS was the end of the mad, rambling record, and Langdon did
not know but what every word, was true. He rose and went on the
verandah. The stars were paling in the east, and it was time to
call the others. They rose hastily, and after a hurried breakfast
started on the man hunt. They went straight to the lagoon, as it
was the nearest point where they could pick up the tracks. It was
deserted, but it was evident from the tracks that the madman had
a couple of horses with him, though Langdon had not seen them the
night before.</p>

<p>The tracks were soon found, and with the black trooper Don,
and Barlow's boy, Wellington, riding ahead a little apart from
each other, they were followed without a break for about ten
miles. Then ahead of them loomed a dark belt of brigalow scrub,
and above, the crests of the trees could be seen a line of red
rock.</p>

<p>'Is he going at random, or making for anywhere?' asked
Barnlow.</p>

<p>'Making for somewhere seemingly. I know that dyke; there's a
tableland on top, but I doubt if the horses can get up,' returned
Whitlaw.</p>

<p>The tracks led them right to the foot of the conglomerate
wall, and-there they lost them.</p>

<p>They dismounted, and there being a little water in a
rock-hole, they were able to eat something. The boys searched
about, and presently announced that to the left there was a
ravine, up which the tracks went.</p>

<p>'Looks like making for a known point. I wonder how long he's
been hanging about the district,' said Whitlaw.</p>

<p>'Can't tell from that diary; there are no dates,' answered
Langdon. He had confided to his companions, the main facts of the
record he had read the previous night.</p>

<p>They were soon off again, and riding in single file up the
ravine, wherein there was a beaten pad.</p>

<p>'A black's track,' said Whitlaw, when they at last reached the
tableland of level ground, of which the precipitous wall formed
the edge. 'Don! You knowem this fellow track?'</p>

<p>'One time big corroboree make him,' replied the boy.</p>

<p>'Ah! I remember now. They had a big cattle slaughter about two
years ago, and we found a lot of them assembled for a big
jamboree of some sort. The place is over here somewhere, but we
came to it from a different direction. That lunatic must have
made friends with the niggers while he has been at that
lagoon.</p>

<p>'Blackfellows' track sit down?' he asked the boy. Don said
that there had been two blacks with the white man for some miles.
On they went, but sundown found them still on the level scrubby
tableland. Wellington said there was a creek a little bit off
their track, and to it they went, and were lucky in finding water
and feed.</p>

<p>'What mad motive can the man have in his brain?' remarked
Barnlow, as they smoked in camp.</p>

<p>'Heaven knows! He is aware that he will be hunted, and has
some insane idea that the blacks will shelter him&mdash;perhaps
thinks he can incite them to mischief,' answered Langdon.</p>

<p>'He's wrong there. They've had the fear of the Lord put into
them too well,' said the sub-inspector. 'We must try and get hold
of some of the niggers; they might catch him for us.'</p>

<p>In the morning they soon came across more tracks of blacks
tending the same way, and presently they heard the chop of a
tomahawk in the scrub. They halted, and Don and Wellington went
ahead on foot. They were absent some time, and presently returned
with a couple of bucks.</p>

<p>The madman was with the blacks; the camp was at the other
edge of the tableland, about five miles away. They were going to
kill one of the white man's horses to-night and have a big feed.
They didn't want the white man with them&mdash;they were afraid
of him. He kept talking to himself. But he had promised them the
horse, and after they had eaten it they intended to get him to go
away.</p>

<p>'I want to capture him alive,' said Whitlaw.</p>

<p>'And I want to shoot him out of hand!' put in Langdon.</p>

<p>Whitlaw grinned meaningly. 'Perhaps we can manage both,' he
said.</p>

<p>A consultation took place. It was arranged that Don and
Wellington should strip and join the blacks. Then they could
induce a good number of strong bucks to help seize the madmen
during the progress of the horse feast The whites would remain in
concealment, as if they showed up Whitby would at once take
flight.</p>

<p>The camp of the blacks was between a scrubby gully and the
descent from the tableland. At that place the wall was steep and
precipitous, a sheer fall of nearly a hundred feet. There was a
spring at the head of the gully, and in the scrub the three men
concealed themselves. The horse had been killed and dismembered
before they reached their hiding-place, and the many fires
illuminated a strange and savage scene, Don and Wellington
looking just as wild as their temporary associates.</p>

<p>Whitby was sitting, or rather squatting, by himself, seemingly
enjoying the surroundings. At times he talked loudly to himself,
but the blacks did not heed him&mdash;they were too busy
devouring the half-cooked flesh.</p>

<p>Presently the natives got up, and began to assemble in groups,
as the gins commenced a monotonous chant, keeping time by beating
sticks together. The men formed in two lines for a corroboree.
Some were painted, some were not. It was agreed that during the
performance the signal should be given to secure Whitby, but he
anticipated matters!</p>

<p>At sight of the flitting, circling figures a frenzy seemed to
seize him, and he rose suddenly to his feet, and dashed in
amongst them, shouting at the top of his voice. So scared were
the blacks that they scattered apart, and left him alone.</p>

<p>The madman, now possessed by a legion of devils, commenced to
rave and declaim. He appeared to be addressing imaginary figures,
but his words were so rapid and incoherent that his listeners
could not follow them. Presently he jumped into one of the fires,
and commenced kicking the live coals and brands about, raving
frantically all the time. The blacks were afraid to approach him,
and even Don and Wellington were as scared as the others.</p>

<p>'He'll get away,' whispered Langdon to Whitlaw. 'Shall I shoot
him?'</p>

<p>'No, I must make an effort to arrest him, else I shall get
hauled over the coals. Wait a little.'</p>

<p>The madman still kept up his demoniac capers, and the men
watched, hoping that he would soon fall with exhaustion. He was
evidently growing weaker and fainter, and at last he sank down,
panting hoarsely, and frothing at the mouth. The devil within him
had spent itself at last.</p>

<p>'Now for it!' cried Whitlaw, rushing forward with the
handcuffs in his hand, followed by the others. Don and Wellington
sprang to help, but the blacks stood stupidly staring.</p>

<p>But the frantic wretch was not to be taken so easily. He was
on his feet like a wild cat. In the flickering light he
recognised Langdon, and a cry like a savage beast's came from
him. Whitlaw, who was first, was dashed aside like a child; but
Langdon instinctively raised his revolver and fired at the
hideous being, who, with his blazing eyes and dripping mouth,
looked like nothing human.</p>

<p>Whitby received the bullet; but annihilation alone would have
stopped his rush. He sprang on Langdon and hurled him violently
to the ground; but the others tore him off as fighting dogs are
torn apart, Struggling and biting, he got away from them, and ran
straight for the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>Suddenly he disappeared, as if by magic.</p>

<p>'Over the cliff!' cried Barnlow, and they went and peered
over, but could not at first see or hear, anything. A moan of
mortal agony, however, arose from the ground at their very feet,
and one of the blacks came forward and' pointed out what bad
happened.</p>

<p>A narrow cleft fissured, the rock for some distance from the
brow of the cliff, and into this crack the madman had fallen.
Down he had crashed about thirty or forty feet, when the
narrowing: sides of the fissure gripped and held him&mdash;held
him pinioned beyond release to endure a living death.</p>

<p>Barnlow turned back and went to where Langdon was still lying.
He got water and strove to revive him. The sub-inspector stood
and looked at the crack in the ground, from which pitiable moans
and whimpers ascended. There was only one thing to do. The man
was dying by inches, and there was no chance of getting him
out.</p>

<p>'Shoot me, oh shoot me!' groaned the voice, the agony
seemingly having restored his reason. Whitlaw spoke a few words
to his boy; then he, too, turned away.</p>

<p>The report of a Martini rang out on the night; and Langdon,
looking stupidly round, said, 'What the deuce are they firing
at?'</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a> 13. &mdash; THE ISLAND OF SCORIAE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 26 June 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
'YES, It's a man in a canoe,' said the one who was looking
through the big telescope.</p>

<p>'He's dead, at any rate, or surely he'd make some movement,'
replied the other, who was holding a field glass to his eye.</p>

<p>The course of the steamer had been changed, and she was
rapidly approaching the subject of speculation; the boat swung on
the falls a short distance above the surface of the water: the
crew in their places, all ready to be lowered.</p>

<p>It was a hot, calm day, and the steamer would do most of the
work better and quicker than many would. The motionless
canoe&mdash;for they could see now it was a sort of
canoe&mdash;was getting close; the telegraph rang, the engine
ceased to throb, and in a minute or two the boat was off, and a
few strokes brought her alongside the curious-looking craft.</p>

<p>The doctor had gone off in the steamer's boat, and presently
the second officer hailed the ship to say that the man had still
some life in him, and they would be on board with him
directly.</p>

<p>The boat came alongside; the man had been lifted out of the
canoe into it, and the doctor remained with him supporting him as
the boat rose up to the davits. With great care the wasted,
sun-blackened figure was lifted on the deck and laid under the
shade of the awning. Suddenly he opened his eyes, and, dim though
they were, he seemed to recognise where he was, and what had
happened.</p>

<p>'My boat! My boat!' he said in English faintly, and struggled
feebly to rise. The doctor guessed his meaning; and spoke to the
captain.</p>

<p>'Strange to say the boat, or canoe, that had been left when
they took the man out, had drifted into the ship, and was now
close alongside.'</p>

<p>The captain said something about the vessel's attraction, and
told the second officer to get rope and tackle on the old
catamaran and haul her aboard, but to take everything but first.
Then he went back to the survivor with the doctor, and they
watched his removal.</p>

<p>The interrupted voyage was soon renewed, and the captain had
finished entering it in his log, when Cliffe, the doctor, came
in.</p>

<p>'How far's the nearest land?' he asked.</p>

<p>The captain unrolled the chart, and took a compass and swept a
radius round his last pencil mark.</p>

<p>'Strange to say, for these seas, 150 miles all round would not
land us anywhere. The nearest islands are some of the islands in
the Sulu Archipelago, on ahead.'</p>

<p>Cliffe stood beside him; he and the captain had been friends
for some time, apart from their present situation. 'Impossible to
believe. If that man had come from any land in that canoe-thing,
how long would he have taken to do 150 miles and over?'</p>

<p>'Can't say, haven't looked at the thing.'</p>

<p>'Come and see it.'</p>

<p>They descended to the deck, and approached the Noah's Ark,
which had been laid on the hatch. It was certainly a
queer-looking craft; like a huge clumsy canoe, dug out, or
burnt-out of a tree trunk of giant girth. But then the material
was not wood. It clinked like metal, or slag of some sort. The
captain regarded it curiously.</p>

<p>'Was it heavy?' he asked the second officer.</p>

<p>'Not particularly.'</p>

<p>'Anything in it?'</p>

<p>'Only some parcels done up In what looked like the legs of a
pair of trousers and the sleeves of a coat. No paddles or
sails.'</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>'They're his,' he said. 'Run up, stop her, and then heave the
lead, I quick,' said the captain. The officer, rather amazed, ran
up to carry out the order. The captain and doctor followed more
slowly.</p>

<p>'How's the man getting on?' he asked, as he unrolled his
chart.</p>

<p>'He'll be right enough, although he ought to be as dead as a
door nail. I put him to sleep.'</p>

<p>The captain was standing listening with his forefinger on the
chart. Then came the voice of the quartermaster, followed by the
startled voice of the mate, repeating the cry of 'Fifty
fathoms!'</p>

<p>Cliffe, who had been watching the direction of his companion's
finger, turned' his face up with a scared look. There should have
been no bottom properly speaking, as the Admiralty chart made it
over a thousand fathoms.</p>

<p>'Pick up some of the bottom, if you can, Mr. Greaves,' said
the captain, quietly. Then there was silence while a tallowed
lead was sent down.</p>

<p>'Looks like black coral,' said Mr. Greaves, coming up with the
lead in his hand. The captain and doctor examined it. Some
curious looking stuff had been picked up, looking, as the officer
said, something like fragments of black coral.</p>

<p>'Keep another lead going, and go half speed,' said the
captain. 'Cliffe, you get these cinders off the lead and clean
them, will you. I want to have another look at that old
junk.'</p>

<p>The lead showed fifty, sixty, seventy fathoms as they went on,
then suddenly there was no bottom, and shortly the steamer was
again at full speed.</p>

<p>'Queer start this,' said Haughton, the captain, as he compared
the stuff he had gathered on the floor of the canoe with the
stuff that bad come off the lead.</p>

<p>The steamer was not a regular passenger steamer, and on this
occasion she had only a couple of passengers on board in the
shape of two Portuguese merchants from Singapore, so there was no
fuss made, and the friends had leisure to discuss the affair
without interruption.</p>

<p>'Where did the man come from? That's the question,' returned
Cliffe.</p>

<p>'He didn't come 150 miles in that tank without paddles, sails,
or provisions. He would have been roasted.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe he was on it more than forty-eight hours, but
I think he must have suffered a good bit before. What the devil
is the thing made of?'</p>

<p>'I can't make out, but it once was wood, and wood that doesn't
grow in these seas. I hope your man won't die before he
awakes.'</p>

<p>'You bet, I will look after him. But what do you make of this
stuff from the sounding lead being the same as that you got out
of the canoe?'</p>

<p>'That they came from the same place.'</p>

<p>'The bottom of the sea?'</p>

<p>'Not quite, but it's the bottom now, whatever it was when he
left it. In return, what do you make of our getting bottom where
there ought to have been a thousand fathoms?'</p>

<p>'Been some sort of a heave-up down below.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, and thanks to the depth at which it occurred it
was not felt about here so much as it might have been.'</p>

<p>Towards evening the patient awoke, much restored but Cliffe
thought it wise not to allow him to excite himself by telling his
story for a while. He asked for his parcels, which were given him
unopened, and he took a little food and went off to sleep again.
Next morning he was strong enough to talk.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE CASTAWAY</h3>

<p class="first">
'I HAD been in Borneo collecting natural history specimens,
and hearing a good deal about Celebes, I agreed with some natives
who were in Borneo on a trading voyage to take me with item when
they returned. There were four of us on board; the two brothers
from Macassar, who owned the proa, and a Dyak. I, of course, was
only a passenger. We got caught in terrible weather, and were
driven clean out of our course. One of the brothers was washed
overboard, and when the weather broke we were dismasted and
helpless. The weather, I tell you, had been such as I had never
experienced even in these seas. I tried to get things patched up,
and an attempt was made to rig something up; but I found it was
useless. The Macassar man had gone cranky, as they're fond of
doing, and before long he and the Dyak started a fight. He knifed
the Dyak and then came for me; but luckily I had my revolver, and
he thought it better to go overboard, which he did, and I was
left alone with the other fellow. Very unreliable men to deal
with are men from Macassar, when anything goes a bit bandy.</p>

<p>'The other fellow died, and I put his body overboard, and
tried to get some sort of sail spread, and figure out where I
was&mdash;I imagined somewhere in the middle of the Celebes Sea,
and I also imagined I might pull up the Philippines if I had no
luck; and nothing picked me up before.</p>

<p>'It was the second night after I been alone that I ran
aground. You may well stare; but it was a fact.</p>

<p>'At dark, there was no land visible; but here I was, awakened
by getting in amongst rollers and the proa being thrown bodily on
to what sounded like a reef or spit coral. There was a kind of
mist about, and I could make nothing out as to where I was or
what sort of a place I had got on to. I concluded that it must
have been all to glory in my calculation, for I knew there could
be no uncharted coral reef where I imagined myself to be. The
roller that had pitched the proa ashore had been a good, strong
one, and the proa was light, and we were pretty well high; and
dry. I took the end of rope and got down. Before me was a dark,
flat mass, and on either side the white dance of the rollers. I
didn't like the appearance of things. The ground, or whatever it
was, felt hot through my canvas shoes, and there was a nasty,
steamy, treacherous vapor about. I decided that the best thing to
do was to stop on board till daylight.</p>

<p>'When day broke the white mist was like a fog, but when the
sun rose it lifted, and I had a chance of seeing my position. It
was anything but cheerful one. Before me stretched a rising slope
of black cinders&mdash;scoriae, in fact&mdash;and that was all
there was to be seen, for it extended beyond my vision right and
left, ringed by the white-crested rollers. That was not quite
all, for jets and puffs of steam were rising here and there. I
knew what had happened. I had drifted on to an upheaved island,
probably one that had risen during the bad weather we had just
experienced. There was nothing comforting about it. To the
officers of a surveying man-of-war the sight would have been more
interesting than it was to me. I wanted an island with something
living on it, not an expanse of half-cold cinders that would take
centuries to become inhabitable. I determined to explore it, any
way. It would be an exceptional adventure. I took the bit of an
anchor out of the proa and carried it ashore and made her fast,
got a bottle of water, and started. By this time the mist had
cleared. It was hot, and the stuff was fatiguing to walk oh; so I
went slow. But still I was pretty well pumped when I got to the
top of the rise.</p>

<p>'Lord! I had no idea that the place was such a size! I was on
a tableland stretching far away, and covered with all manner of
strange-looking objects. Give me a drink, doctor, will you,
please?'</p>

<p>'I gassed at these a long time before approaching them. They
looked like ruins, but all was black, silent, and lifeless, so I
advanced. I gave one backward glance at my proa, took a swig out
of my bottle, and then walked forward on that strange plain! They
were ruins, ruins of an ancient prehistoric town that had gone
down to the bottom of the sea in some unknown past, and remained
there, preserves until it was again upheaved. The volcanic dust
and cinders had choked the habitation, covered the inhabitants
and hardened above them, but it had been a civilised city. I was
there a week, and I will show you what I found.'</p>

<p>Then parcels were produced and opened. They contained
bracelets and other ornaments of gold and silver, beautifully
chased and worked, some studded with gems, weapons and
instruments of steel, iron and brass, domestic utensils made of
copper, figures of men and women worked in metal, and showing a
high degree of art, assimilating somewhat to the Japanese style;
and one strangely-shaped object which he held out to them
triumphantly. The article in question was clogged with the
half-ossified stuff that covered it, so that the captain did not
at first recognise its shape. Suddenly he perceived what it
was.</p>

<p>'Good Gracious, man! It's a revolver.'</p>

<p>'Yes it is. Nothing new under the sun, you see. It's not a
modern one.'</p>

<p>Both men examined it carefully, but it bore no resemblance in
shape to the modern weapon, although the working principle seemed
the same.</p>

<p>They put it aside for after examination.</p>

<p>'Tell us about the city?' said the doctor.</p>

<p>'The city must have been an immense octagon in shape. At all
the angles stood huge figures, as gigantic as those on Easter
Island, but of infinitely better workmanship, buried to the waist
in ashes and cinders, solidified almost to rock. The houses must
have been low and massive, seemingly, built by people who were
aware that they lived on an unstable land.</p>

<p>'All remains&mdash;human, animal, and vegetable&mdash;were
buried beneath my reach. The articles I had managed to secure, I
found half exposed, or on shelves and places above the level of
the fall of ashes and cinders. Now, the boat that you found me in
was one of many down at a certain part of the city that I suspect
must, at one time, have been part of the harbor. Some were much
larger than others, and larger than this one you have on
board.'</p>

<p>'What do you think they were made of?'</p>

<p>'I think they were originally built of wood, and subjected to
some chemical process. I went round the island, or at least, far
enough to see its circumference, and I should put it down as
being about thirty miles round&mdash;that is, it had risen that
much out of the sea. But the original land may have been part of
a continent. Probably was.</p>

<p>'I used to return at night to the proa, for the nights were
uncomfortably warm on the island of Scoriae, as I christened
it, and the immediate neighborhood of the sea was pleasanter.
Fortunately, my provisions held out, and there were one or two
inert springs on the island, the water of which, when allowed to
cool, had only a slight mineral taste.</p>

<p>'I kept an anxious look out once or twice a day from the
highest point, but though I saw the smoke of several steamers,
they all passed without seeing the new upheaval. One evening when
standing at the edge of the plateau, I saw that the proa was in
white water. What could have happened? She was firm as a rock;
she could get go to the sea, the sea must have come to her. My
island was subsiding!</p>

<p>'Desperately, I was about to start and rush for my only hope,
the proa, when I saw that I was too late; she lay over with a
list, and the waves were already rioting over her. She would
sink, water-logged, with the island. I looked around; there was
no motion; but the circle of surf was slowly but surely,
diminishing.</p>

<p>'The old boats occurred to me, and I fled to them, and
selected this one, as probably, being the highest up and standing
upright, it might float. I collected the different things I had
found, and got into the ancient boat, and awaited life or death.
The waters came on and on, but it was nearly midnight before they
reached me. I was afraid that the closing in of the breakers
would cause a turmoil, in which my craft would upset; but
fortunately most of this dispersed and quieted down before the
island sank to my level. I floated buoyantly over the Island of
Scoriae. I know little more, beyond the burning, pitiless sun,
the heated vessel that seemed doomed to be my floating coffin,
and the thought that it would have been better to have gone down
with the island and had it all over. You know the rest.'</p>

<p>The relics were again examined and admired, and being safely
done up, were, put in the strong-room by the captain. One of the
Portuguese merchants seemed particularly, struck, with the
appearance of the strange craft that lay on the deck, and several
times he was seen to smile. But he said nothing, neither to his
countryman nor Captain Haughton.</p>

<p>The rescued man was well and strong by the time they arrived
at Hongkong. The doctor had rigged him out, and he begged the
captain and his friend the doctor to accept some things from his
store, which would repay them for their kindness. Amongst other
things, the captain accepted what they took to be an ancient
revolver, he having taken a great fancy to the curio. On reaching
Hongkong the captain found an Imperative telegram awaiting him,
ordering him off to Shanghai at once.</p>

<p>That night the rescued man came off in a sampan with coolies,
and removed his ark. He gave them an address where they would
find him on their return. Captain Haughton duly returned in the
course of a few weeks, but the rescued man was not at the address
he had given, nor had he appeased there.</p>

<p>The captain, on his way back to, his ship, met the Portuguese
merchant, who returned to take tiffin with him and Cliffe.</p>

<p>'It is very strange,' he said, during the meal, 'but I have
received very peculiar news from Macassar, where I once had a
business. You know that in Celebes there are many native rajahs
reputed to possess much wealth. One of these, a rajah of the
Maudars, lately lost some of his treasures. He kept them
concealed in an ancient sepulchre, where the rajahs were buried.
The treasure was also very ancient, the spoils of centuries, and
the place of concealment was in the outer coffin of a very
celebrated rajah who had been embalmed and placed in several
coffins. You may imagine that the outer one was of considerable
size. The thieves were disturbed, but they escaped with much
booty, and the outside coffin of the dead and gone rajah. They
reached their proa and got to sea, and it is reported that one
was a white man.'</p>

<p>Haughton looked at Cliffe.</p>

<p>'Of what were these coffins made?'</p>

<p>'Of a timber peculiar to Celebes. As it ages it hardens, until
it becomes like tough metal! light and buoyant. I've seen several
of them; the last time was on the deck of this steamer.'</p>

<p>The captain and doctor rose and went to their cabins. They
returned with the articles presented Up their grateful guest.</p>

<p>'Are these likely to have been part of the rajah's ancient
loot?' asked Cliffe.</p>

<p>'Very likely; I should say certainly. This, for instance; is a
very ancient Portuguese pistol. I once dealt in antiquities. It
was a clumsy thing, worked with a wheel; and about the of the
first pistols ever invented. This has been lost in some limestone
creek,' and partly petrified over with some deposit&mdash;no, it
has nothing to do with a prehistoric revolver.'</p>

<p>'But,' said he captain eagerly, 'How about the soundings?'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said, the Portuguese merchant politely, 'I am not a
mariner, I cannot, possibly offer an opinion. But, knowing these
seas, it is not beyond possibility that English, Dutch, and
French survey boats may have left a fifty-fathom bank
unmarked.'</p>

<p>'Why did, you not give us a hint when you recognised
the&mdash;coffin?'</p>

<p>'Was it any business of mine? And besides, captain, the man
has not swindled you; those relics are valuable enough.'</p>

<p><br>
'YOU know, Cliffe,' said the captain afterwards: 'I'd just
been reading up submarine eruptions and things, until I got it on
the brain. When you suggested that the man never got there in
that coffin from any known land, I jumped to the idea of an
unknown shoal or reef, and ordered the soundings.'</p>

<p>'But how about the man getting the idea?'</p>

<p>'If you remember, we were talking of it beside his bunk, when
he must have been shamming insensibility. What a glorious liar
the fellow must be to reel it off like that. I respect him.'</p>

<p>'What became of the real proa?'</p>

<p>'That,' said the captain, 'is one of the stories of the sea
that for many reasons are never told.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>14. &mdash; THAT FOOL JONES</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 22 April 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
SENSIBLE people said Jones was a fool. Flippant people also
said laughingly that Jones was a fool, adding, besides, some few
remarks about old fools being the worst; and even the general
ruck of people who did not take any interest in Jones or his
belongings said, when they heard the details, that Jones was a
fool. This was hard upon Jones. He had simply pleased himself, as
he had a perfect right to do, and yet the whole scattered,
population of the district in which he lived took it upon
themselves to dub him a fool.</p>

<p>All that Jones had done, in his comparatively old age, was to
marry a young widow, and a pretty young widow as well.
Considering that half, or the whole of the young fellows in the
neighborhood would have been only too glad to marry her, the
reason why Jones should be considered a fool seem rather
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>But the reasons given why Jones was a fool were many and
various. She would get tired of him, and run away with some
younger man. She would spend his money like water, and bring him
to poverty, and his grey hairs in sorrow to the grave; and all
the other things which giddy young wives are supposed to do to
old and doting husbands.</p>

<p>But sweet-faced Mary Jones did none of these things. She
looked after the domestic affairs of her husband's homestead
staidly, and properly. She showed no sign of a wish for gaiety,
nor a spendthrift dissipation. Her elderly husband grew young
again beneath her smiles, and seemed to value them more than
anything, until the astonished residents on the various stations
and selections round about had to confess that, after all, Jones
had not been such a fool as they thought.</p>

<p>And so things went on peacefully, quietly, and I prosperously.
And Mary Jones never thought of any looming thundercloud about to
burst over her head. But there was one, although she was innocent
of its origin. Jones had met Mary at a boarding house in Sydney,
and considering how many widows there are sailing under false
colors in Sydney, it certainly was a rash thing for Jones to
accept her story on trust, and marry her. But Mary was a bona
fide widow, and the old fool Jones was quite right in trusting
her and her story.</p>

<p>And her story was that she did not want to say much about her
husband, and Jones, concluding, therefrom that he had been a bad
lot, did not press the matter. Jones was sitting upon the
verandah in the cool of the evening, putting a lash on a
stockwhip, and Mary was sitting beside him. They had no children,
although three years had passed, and this had drawn the old
husband and young wife nearer together. It was about an hour
before sunset and the evening, was calm and peaceful. A man was
seen riding up the home paddock, a stranger to the place. He hung
his horse up at the hitching tree, and walked up to the
verandah.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Mr. Jones.'</p>

<p>'Evening, Sam,' returned Jones, recognising the man, who kept
a small public house, and the changing place for the coaches,
about three miles away. 'The coach left a lady at our place. She
has come up to see Mrs. Jones. Could you send the buggy over for
her, sir?'</p>

<p>'Tea, certainly; I'll see about it at once.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, Mr. Jones; I wish you would.'</p>

<p>How's that, Sam?' asked Jones quickly.</p>

<p>Sam looked down at his feet 'You see, sir, I she's come up
from Sydney, and 'we're not altogether used to the ways of the
place down there.'</p>

<p>Sam said this as though the local surroundings were instinct
with innate virtue. Then he beckoned to Jones, and in a hoarse
whisper, which could be heard a mile off, but was intended to be
quiet and discreet, he continued:</p>

<p>'You see, she I says she's Mrs. Jones's sister-in-law, and
she's just about as drunk as drunk can be. Coachman I glad to get
rid of her, for she was using the most I awful language, and he
had a lot of passengers I aboard. Lord! look at Mrs. Jones!'</p>

<p>Swiftly turning round, Jones saw that his wife had fallen back
in her cane chair in a faint.</p>

<p>He got the water bag, and moistened his handkerchief. 'Run,
Sam, like a good fellow, and tell Mat to get the horses harnessed
up!' Sam departed, and Jones set himself to work to revive his
wife. Gradually she came to, and after a deep sign or two, she
said&mdash;'Fred, must you let that woman come here?'</p>

<p>'I see nothing else to do. She can't stop where she is, and
we'll try and get her right, and pack her back again. She is your
sister-in-law, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes; from the description of her, I should think so; that
man's sister. Don't go for her yourself, Fred; send Mat.'</p>

<p>'But if she is as Sam says, I must go, dear.'</p>

<p>'What does it matter?' said his wife, with more passion than
he had ever heard before in her voice. 'Sam has seen her. The
coachman saw her; what does it matter? Besides, I must tell you
something.'</p>

<p>The rattle of the buggy was heard approaching, and Jones went
to the edge of the verandah, and called to the driver&mdash;'Mat!
I want you to go over to Sam's place, and bring back a lady who's
been left there by the coach!'</p>

<p>Mat drove off, and Jones went back to his wife.</p>

<p>'Fred, there's really no harm in what I am going to tell; no
harm of mine, only being such a fool as not to tell you before.
But I couldn't, I couldn't. I must now: That man died in prison;
he is buried in the Rookwood Cemetery, in the portion set apart
for convicts. Before he got into prison he led me a life of
misery, which afterwards, when poverty overtook us, he, at the
instigation of his sister, tried to turn into one of shame, and I
fled in horror from them.'</p>

<p>She hid her face in her husband's shoulder while she told this
part of her story, and when she felt his arm tighten around her
she went on with more confidence.</p>

<p>'I had a good old friend, a sort of aunt by name only, and I
went to her, and a day or two afterwards my husband was arrested,
and I was free. He died in gaol, and relieved me from the hateful
tie. Oh! surely, he was the vilest man who ever breathed, and
this woman who is coming is the vilest of women. It was she who
made that horrible proposition to him. Oh! Fred! Fred! what have
I brought upon you!'</p>

<p>'We'll worry through, little woman; you needn't see her. I'll
fix things up.</p>

<p>'See her! I must see her. How can I leave you to bear it all,
alone? No, I must take my share.'</p>

<p>They talked until the lights of the buggy were seen coming
across the paddock. The buggy drove up to the stable, and Mat's
voice was heard crying out, 'Here, hold on, missus!' The woman
had made an attempt to jump out as soon as the buggy stopped, and
catching her skirt in the step, had fallen on her face. She
stumbled up again as Jones approached, and remarked,
interspersing her words with foul oaths&mdash;'This is a pretty
way to welcome a lady, isn't it? Throw her on her face in the
road!'</p>

<p>Jones said quietly, 'Are you Miss Benison? If so come inside
and have some tea. Then you can have a rest.'</p>

<p>'Tea, you old fool,' she returned. 'I've something better than
tea here,' and fumbling in the bosom of her dress she drew forth
a flask, and, taking out the stopper, put it to her lips; she
tilted her head back, and drained the last drops that were left,
then with a drunken laugh threw the empty flask away.</p>

<p>'She's been swiping at that all the way. Blessed if I haven't
been frightened of my life,' said Mat.</p>

<p>Jones took the woman by the arm and led her away, Oh, the
horror of it? Her hat was awry, her dress disarranged, her face
red, bloated, and leering. And waiting in the verandah was his
quiet, pretty Mary, with her face blanched white with disgust.
She stumbled up the steps of the verandah, and wanted to embrace
Mary with maudlin effusion but she shudderingly put her off.
Somehow or other they got her to her room, and she subsided into
drunken slumber.</p>

<p>No need to tell of the days that followed. They linger still
in the memories of Jones and his wife as a fearful nightmare. The
woman managed to get liquor through some unprincipled man on the
station, but Jones could not determine who. She had money with
her, and this happened when he had refused to give her more
liquor. She was cunning, with the cunning of madness, and just as
sleepless as a maniac. One evening in her mad range she told Mary
that her husband was still alive. There had been two Benisons in
the gaol, and the one that was buried was not her husband.</p>

<p>'Ah' she screamed in her drunken fury. 'Bigamy, that's the
word, and that's what you'll go to gaol for, my prim and proper
lady. I never committed bigamy, bad as I am,' and she staggered
away to her room, leaving two horror-struck people behind
her.</p>

<p>'Fred,' whispered his wife. 'This cannot be true. The governor
showed me the named full in the gaol books&mdash;John Aubrey
Benison. There could not be two of the same Christian names.'</p>

<p>'It's a wicked, drunken lie,' he said, and soothed her as best
he could.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was seriously upset He could not leave his
wife alone on the station with a woman who might at any moment
develop symptoms of insanity, and go down and investigate this
hideous assertion. No, he must stay and bear his burden, and a
burden it was. He was the scorn and the pity of 'the place.</p>

<p>A night or two after this the woman got up, and wandering
about the place fell off the verandah, and they picked her up
senseless. They put her in bed, and Mary, stopped with her. The
doctor came, but could do nothing, and for days she lay
unconscious, while Mary, and her husband took it in turns to
watch. At last she opened her eyes, still dim and bloodshot, but
conscious, and she lay like that for hours, not speaking, only
following Mary about with her eyes wherever she went. At last she
spoke.</p>

<p>'Mary, I am dying. But you have been very good to me. I have
something to tell you.' She paused from weakness, then she went
on. 'There's a plot against your husband to get money out of him
under the assertion that your first husband is still alive. It's
all a lie. He's dead and rotten safe enough. They're old friends
of my brother's who've hatched it, and one of 'em will be up here
soon. I came on first to see how the land lay; but the drink's
killed me, and I'm not sorry.'</p>

<p>Then quietly, without another word, the woman passed the
border.</p>

<p>She had been lying in her quiet grave at the station for some
time, when one day a stranger came riding up to the station, and
asked for Mr. Jones. In return Mr. Jones went out to see him,
refraining from asking him in, as his character was written on
his face.</p>

<p>'I come from a firm of lawyers in Sydney,' said the man.
'There is an unfortunate mistake in the matter of your
marriage&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Wait a bit,' said Jones. He approached the stranger's horse,
tied the reins to the stirrup iron, and started the steed down
the paddock.</p>

<p>'What the&mdash;'</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence. Next minute Jones was laying
the stockwhip he carried in his hand into him. In vain he roared
and sought shelter. Even when he got on the roof of the stable
the lash followed him.</p>

<p>At last Jones desisted, called him down, and dispatched him
with a parting kick. And that was the last Mr. and Mrs. Jones
ever saw of any remains of her unfortunate and unhappy past.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. &mdash; A SUBSTANTIAL GHOST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 22 July 1899</h3>

<p class="first">'I WON'T have it,' said the shepherd.</p>

<p>It was in the old days of shepherds and ration-carriers,
before wire fences stretched their webs over the country.</p>

<p>'Won't have what?' said the ration-carrier sulkily as he
dismounted. The rations for the brigalow hut had to be brought on
horseback, as there was a particularly piece of rough country to
cross, and the usual ration cart was liable to be knocked about a
bit if it ventured on the track.</p>

<p>Therefore the shepherd who lived and worked at the brigalow
hut had his rations brought to him on horseback, and as it was
generally late before the hut was reached, the ration-carrier
always stepped the night. On this occasion Ned Byrne, the man
with the rations, muttered sulkily to himself as he undid the
pack and unsaddled, something about having to stop with a loony
all night for Donstan, the then shepherd, was notorious for being
just about ten times as cranky as most shepherd put together.</p>

<p>'What is it you won't hive?' he asked testily alter the horses
had been hobbled, rations post away, and he had picked a
firestick out of the fire and lit his pipe with it.</p>

<p>Donstan had been putting the tea things on the table, a loin
of mutton was sizzling in the camp oven, and a
comfortable-looking currant damper reposed an the table; and Ned
Byrne thought it would not be such an uncomfortable camp after
all.</p>

<p>Donstan stood by the rude table a sheath-knife in his hand,
tapping the table with it as he spoke. He was a shout, sturdy
man, with a white beard, well-trimmed for a shepherd of those
days, and looked what he really was, a broken-down gentleman with
a story, but in the opinion of the station folks he was simply an
extra shingle shorter than the rest of the shepherds. It may be
noticed all the shepherds stationed at the brigalow hut were
addicted to mania more or less.</p>

<p>Donstan stood there tapping the knife on the table in a
nervous manner. 'What is it I won't have?' he repeated.</p>

<p>'Well, I won't have that white-faced Chinaman with the hole in
his forehead corning out of that brigalow scrub every night, and
knocking at the door.'</p>

<p>Byrne looked at him in amazement, and began to wish he had not
turned his horses out. A ride some in the dark would be nothing
out of the way, but this was too much altogether out of the
way.</p>

<p>Donstan went on quite quietly.</p>

<p>'There is no particular reason why he should take such trouble
to come and knock at my door. I did not make the hole in his
forehead.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't suppose you did,' said Ned, to break the
uncomfortable silence that ensued after this statement.</p>

<p>Donstan laughed uneasily, and put down the knife, much to
Ned's relief.</p>

<p>'I've been talking nonsense?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' replied Byrne, anxious to please him. 'Very dry
weather, as you were saying.'</p>

<p>Donstan took the lid off the camp oven and lifted out the loin
of mutton, and finished the other preparations for the meal. He
now seemed to have become quite himself again, and invited Ned to
commence in quite a different manner. Ned, much relieved, sat
down and began to play a very good knife and fork, inwardly
hoping that Donstan would not have any more uncomfortable fits of
the sort. Nor did he, and they turned into their two bunks at the
proper time, having passed quite a cheerful evening. Ned was
awakened in the middle of the night by his companion talking.</p>

<p>He listened, and distinctly heard what sounded like three loud
knocks at the door. Donstan got out or bed, and Byrne, uncertain
what was going to happen, get out as well. The shepherd,
muttering to himself, opened the door, and made a headlong rush
outside, striking at something with a weapon he had in his hand,
and which Byrne saw, to his dismay, was a sword. It was
moonlight, but the ration carrier could see no one there, and the
lunatic was apparently striking wildly at nothing. Presently he
came back, still talking; and Ned prudently drew back.</p>

<p>'You saw him, the wretch, didn't you?' he demanded of Ned when
he had shut the door again. Byrne was just going to reply 'No,'
when he remembered having been told that one should always humor
a mad person, so he answered: 'Oh, yes, quite distinctly. You cut
him about terribly! I don't think he'll trouble you again.'</p>

<p>'It was the Chinaman with the hole in his forehead. You saw
him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, an ugly wretch he was; like his impudence knocking at a
man's door as though the whole place belonged to him.'</p>

<p>Ned got under his blanket again, but assuredly aid not sleep,
keeping a wary eye upon Donstan, who, however, appeared to sleep
calmly, until daylight; then he got up, and let the sheep out of
the yard, while Byrne went for his 'horses, not sorry to find
himself alive.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Donstan did not betray any symptoms of mania,
and as Ned rode home, he reflected whether, alter all, Donstan
had not been playing a joke to frighten him.</p>

<p>'But where did the knocking come from?' and that thought made
him pull up and ponder. It had certainly been without any doubt
that the knocking came from outside, and not from inside, Ned's
bushmanship was too keen to admit any doubt on that subject; so
he rode in with the burden of unexplained mystery on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Arrived at the station, a bright idea struck him. Instead of
talking about the thing in the men's hut, he would go and confide
in the super. Sinclair was a youngish man, but he had won all
their hearts by the accurate knowledge he had displayed of
station matters, and, moreover, by the sunniest of tempers, and
the most even disposition, that made him laugh under the most
depressing conditions, and keep other people's spirits up.</p>

<p>When Ned told him his tale, Sinclair's face grew grave, and he
remarked, 'Don't say anything to any one on the station, or we
will have some fool going out, and driving the man rank crazy, by
playing foolish jokes.</p>

<p>'He's the best shepherd we've had out at the brigalow hut for
a long time, and has lost less sheep. Keep your tongue between
your teeth, and I'll try and find this puzzle out.'</p>

<p>One night, when the moon was at the full, shortly after
Byrne's experience at the brigalow hut, Sinclair called him, and
told him to get a couple of horses, and come with him to the
shepherd's hut. Ned did not mind when in company, and, besides
that, was anxious to find some clue to the mystery of the knocks,
so he readily rode out that night.</p>

<p>Arrived at the neighborhood of the hut, they tied the horses
to trees, and approached it on foot. All seemed silent, the sheep
were in the yard sleeping quietly, and the accustomed smell of
the yard was rising strong. Sinclair thought as he looked that
the scene was one of perfect peace and quiet, and apart from all
ghostly associations.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ned touched his arm. From the shadow of the brigalow
scrub, from which the hut took its name, a white form was
stealing. Both men saw it plainly. It was a Chinaman in white
garments, and he stole up to the hut, and gave the three ghostly
knocks that Byrne remembered so well. What followed?</p>

<p>The door opened, Donstan issued, and commenced the wild attack
with the sword that Ned had witnessed before. But this time, it
ended differently. Donstan, in his mad fury, fell over a stump,
and lay senseless, the figure of the Chinaman disappeared.
Sinclair hurried forward, and Byrne, awakening from his stupor of
fright, followed him.</p>

<p>Donstan was insensible. He did not appear to have hurt himself
seriously, but he had received a mental shock of some sort that
had rendered him a babbling idiot for a time.</p>

<p>Sinclair had him conveyed to the station, and sent a
hard-headed Scotchman to take his place.</p>

<p><br>
DONSTAN, on his recovery to consciousness, which took place
the day afterwards, confided to Sinclair a story which, to some
extent, explained the mystery of the brigalow hut.</p>

<p>'We had been repulsed from the Peii Ho Forts in China, and a
Chinese merchant, who was a bit of a traitor, came on board, and
suggested that he could show a way of landing, by which the forts
could be taken in the rear. A party of us were sent to
investigate the matter, and I, a middy at the time, was taken by
the Chinese, and kept prisoner until the end of the war. Even
then, I would have been kept hidden, unless I joined one of their
secret societies, and took all the oaths. I consented, and
joined. I don't know to this day what was their reason for making
me do this, but I have cause to think they mistook me for another
officer, against whom they had a bad grudge. When I got back
again amongst my own people, I forgot most of their mummery, and
on one occasion had to give evidence against some pirates we had
captured, who were duly hanged. This was expressly against the
oath I had taken, these pirates being members of the society I
had been forced to Join. From that day tut, my life has been a
torture to me.</p>

<p>'I had to leave the navy on account of what was thought to be
my eccentric conduct, and this has dogged me ever since, and
dragged me down to what I am now. I suppose I have been quite
crazy at times, and it was, I believe, in one of these mad fits
that it is asserted that I attacked a Chinaman on a small
goldfield, and killed him with a driving pick. I do not believe
that I did it. The man was killed in a quarrel with his own
countryman, but owing to my total lapse of memory for a time, I
could not prove where I had been. I escaped, however, with a
short detention in an asylum. Since then this Chinaman with the
hole in his forehead has persistently haunted me.'</p>

<p>'Ned,' said Sinclair, after he had heard the story, 'let us go
out and see how Mac is getting on.'</p>

<p><br>
IT was evening when they reached the brigalow, and Mac was
just putting the hurdles up.</p>

<p>'The very man I wanted to see, Mr. Sinclair. Just come with
me.'</p>

<p>They followed him into the hut, and there found a Chinaman
securely tied up with straps and a dog chain.</p>

<p>'I could not go in to tell ye of it, but this heathen came,
and woke me up knocking at the door last night. When I opened it
he gave a kind of shriek, but before he could run I had him by
the windpipe, and when I had well-nigh choked him I tied him as
you see. I couldn't leave the sheep to go in, and I thought I'd
keep him so till Ned came. He's one of those bodies from the old
diggings, and can speak English as well as possible, but he won't
say a word. Wake up, John!' and Mac gave the sullen man a good
kick, but he only grunted in return.</p>

<p>'So that's the ghost!' said Sinclair, and told Mac how poor
mad Donstan had been tormented.</p>

<p>'How did he slip away the night I was here?' said Ned.</p>

<p>'Oh, just dodged aside and let the lunatic go hacking away at
a spectre of his own fancy. But it must be a wonderful society to
be able to pass this game on from one to another. However, we'll
make my gentleman trot into the station, and Donstan shall decide
what to do with him.'</p>

<p>The effect was magical, and eventually Donstan, convinced of
his illusion, regained his mental health. As they could not well
prosecute the Chinaman for merely knocking at a door, he had to
be let go with a caution, enforced with a stockwhip.</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>16. &mdash; ACCURSED COIN</h2>

<h3><i>Australasian</i>, Melbourne, 18 June 1892</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
A BROAD-BOWED, high-pooped ship is lying hove-to off the
western coast of New Holland, A.D. 1629. It has been a busy
morning on board, for Francis Pelsart has been hanging the
mutinous members of the crew of his wrecked vessel&mdash;the
<i>Batavia</i>&mdash;and only two are left, and they are to be
dealt with after a different fashion. A boat puts off, and pulls
shoreward; in it, heavily ironed, are the last couple of the
misguided followers of Jerome Cornelis.</p>

<p>It is a calm day, and the seamen have no difficulty in finding
a landing-place. The prisoners are ordered out of the boat, and
on the beach their irons are knocked off. A bag of biscuits and a
keg of water are put on shore. Not a word passes, for the two
culprits know full well that the alternative is to swing from the
yard-arm. The boat is pushed off, and pulls back to the ship.</p>

<p>The men sit sullenly down and watch. They can see the boat
hoisted on board; they can even hear the chorus of the sailors
as they make all sail. The light wind is favourable, and
gradually the <i>Nardam</i> grows smaller and smaller, sinks
below the horizon, vanishes, and they are alone on the unknown
continent of New Holland.</p>

<p>The marooned men interchange a few words; one shoulders the
keg, the other the bag of biscuits; then they make their way
across the sand to the higher ground that juts on the beach. They
disappear in the low scrub, and no white man ever sees them
again.</p>

<p><br>
FIFTEEN years afterwards three vessels anchor off the same
place. Several boats are soon out, and while some make for the
rocky I islets that are visible, two row to the shore, and an
armed party of men land and proceed to form a small encampment.
The leader is a swarthy sailor-like man, whose name is destined
to be linked with Australia, one Abel Tasman. He gives his
orders, and small parties of men spread over the country in
different directions. They return by evening, reporting no
success. A watch is set and the captain returns to the ship.</p>

<p>The boats from the reef come back empty handed. The chest
containing many thousands of <i>rix</i>-dollars thrown over from
the <i>Batavia</i> is still at the bottom of the
sea&mdash;undiscoverable. Next morning, on going ashore, Tasman
finds that some natives have ventured to approach the camp. He
feeds them and tries to question them concerning the two white
men. After some trouble they understand him, and an old
white-haired man leads them to a tall tree, and makes signs to
them to dig. They do so, and in a shallow grave soon unearth a
skeleton. The blackfellow imitates a blow and pats his head; they
look and find that the skull has been fractured. Then the native
points to the north and walks a step or two, indicating the way
the other man has taken.</p>

<p>Tasman notes it all down, and gives orders to strike the camp.
The party embark the boats, still searching about the islands,
are recalled, the <i>Limmen</i> and her two consorts make sail,
and the lonely coast is left once more to its native
inhabitants.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
A YOUNG and pretty girl is sitting on a cane chair in the
broad verandah of a station homestead. Her book is lying unread
on her lap, and she is leaning back, with hands clasped behind
her head, dreaming a girl's day-dream, before her is spread as
charming a view as could be found anywhere in broad
Australia.</p>

<p>Down the gentle slope towards the winding river, gleaming here
and there between the trees that fringe its banks, are garden and
vineyard, and cultivated pod; docks, green with lucerne and young
maize; beyond the rising ground is dotted with clumps of shady
timber, and in the background is a low range of hills. But she is
not conscious of the familiar sight until her attention is drawn
to a horseman approaching the house. Rising, she goes to the edge
I of the verandah, and when the rider sees her he waves his hat,
to which she replies with a little flutter of a white
handkerchief.</p>

<p>It is not hard to guess they are lovers when they meet.</p>

<p>"All out for a drive," she says, in answer to his inquiries
after the remainder of the family. "I stayed at home
because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;You thought I might come."</p>

<p>The girl laughs and denies the charge.</p>

<p>"My cousin Fred has come back," he says, after a short
interval of lovers' foolish talk.</p>

<p>"I know," she replies; "I was over at the Danbys' yesterday,
and met him there."</p>

<p>"He never told me," he returns in a slightly surprised voice,
little guessing that the faint blush was caused by the fact that
her wayward fancy was dwelling on Fred Marshall at the very
moment when became in sight.</p>

<p>Charley Marshall and Agnes Macdonald had been engaged for over
a year, and had been unacknowledged sweethearts for a year before
that It was all very prosaic. Charley was an excellent fellow, a
good all-round man, but wedded to his station, which he was
slowly working out of debt; his father had left a heavy mortgage
on it, which delayed their marriage. His highest ideal was to
breed good stock and live a quiet country life, with on
occasional trip to Sydney or Melbourne.</p>

<p>Fred, on the contrary, had roamed all over the world. He had
lived with the Dyaks in Borneo and searched for diamonds in South
Africa. He was reported to have made money on distant goldfields.
He could talk well and modestly of what he had seen and done,
and, moreover, had evidently been impressed by tier. To a girl
fond of reading, with a deep tinge of romance in her nature,
there was an attraction in all this, none the less strong for
owning a touch of disloyalty.</p>

<p>The sun was within an hour of setting before Charley said the
lost good-bye, and started for his own place, about seven miles
away. Dinner over, during which his cousin had been unusually
silent, Fred and he lit their pipes and made themselves
comfortable on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Charley," said his cousin at last, "I may as well tell you
now what brought me back to Australia. Will you be able to leave
the station for a month or two?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a few weeks."</p>

<p>"Right; then yon shall come with me, and I hope to put a
thousand or two in your pocket."</p>

<p>Charley watched a long puff of smoke he exhaled, and in it he
saw a vision of his speedy marriage with Agnes.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?'</p>

<p>"To Western Australia, and on a most romantic expedition. Dot
I will tell you the whole yarn. You know I was knocking about in
the Straits for a number of years, and made one or two trips to
the I island of Flores, to hunt up a supposed gold-field, of
which; however, I could get no trace. I got great friends with an
old Rajah there, a very cute, sensible, old fellow; far too cute
to let me get hold of any information about the old goldfield;
but otherwise he was kindness itself. He was greatly interested
in Australia, and told me that his ancestors had been, yearly, to
their fishing grounds on the north coast almost as far back as
their history went. He could read English, and had got several
books about Australia; he was quite an exceptional old
fellow.</p>

<p>"'Some of our people found a Dutchman there over two hundred
years ago:' he said once.</p>

<p>"'What became of him?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'They brought him here, and lie lived here for many years,
and died here.'</p>

<p>"'Couldn't he get to his country men in Java':' I asked.</p>

<p>"'So far as I can make out from the old stories, he had some
very good reason for not wanting to; he must have been an escaped
murderer, I think.'</p>

<p>"Of course, I am putting the old boy's words into good English;
and, to make a long story short, the Rajah finally showed me an
old parchment manuscript, apparently written in old-fashioned
Dutch, he said he could make nothing of it, that I was the first
person he had shown it to; and that it was supposed to have been
written by the Dutchman who had been found on the Australian
coast. Finally I persuaded him to give it to me and some old
coins that the man had had. I thought I had got hold of something
new about the past history of Australia, and when I was in
Batavia I hunted up some of the old manuscripts there, and after
much trouble made a very free translation of what was written.
Come inside and read it."</p>

<p>Fred went to his room and returned with a paper which he gave
Charley, and smoked silently while the other read.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
I, Gillies Claus, and another man, Pieter Meybeck, were left
on the west coast of New Holland by Captain Pelsart. We made
friends with the savages, and managed to live with them for some
time. One day when out in a canoe amongst the islands where we
were wrecked I saw, just beneath low water, one of the treasure
chests from the <i>Batavia</i>. I told Pieter, and after some
trouble, for he had given up all hope, persuaded him to assist me
in bringing the contents ashore. This took some time, for it was
full of <i>rix</i>-dollars, and the canoes used by the Indians
are very frail.</p>

<p class="quote">
Pieter had made up his mind to die there, but I could not
help hoping that some other ship might come that way and take us
off. I therefore hid the money in a cave. Soon after this Pieter
and I quarrelled, and he thrust at me with one of the Indians'
spears; I struck him with a club and he died, and I buried him.
At last; finding that no ships came, and as I could now go naked
like the Indians, and live like them, I made up my mind to work
my way up north from one tribe of savages to another, and perhaps
I could get to some civilised people.</p>

<p class="quote">
I don't know how long I was travelling; it must have been
nearly two years, for sometimes I stayed months with a tribe. I
took two hundred of the dollars with me, and through all my
wanderings managed to keep them.</p>

<p class="quote">
At last, one day, when I went down to the shore, I saw a proa
at anchor. They were fishing for sea-slugs, as I afterwards
found. I made signals, and presently some of them came ashore. I
gave the <i>Serang</i> some of the dollars, and explained that I
was a white man. He recognised the money and took me on board. I
went in the proa to a town in one of the islands of the Indies,
and was handed over to the chief. I found that they traded with
Batavia: but I had no wish to go there to be hanged, and as they
treat me well, I have remained here.</p>

<p class="quote">
I have tried to persuade them to go with me and get the
hidden money, but they have some superstition against sailing
down the west coast of New Holland that I cannot overcome.</p>

<p class="quote">
The cave is about five miles back from the beach at the foot
of a small hill. You get to the cave by going down a hole
alongside a big, shady tree with a bulgy trunk. The money is in
the third cave. I have everything I want, and do not care about
it now, but I should like to see a priest before I die, for I
have many crimes on my soul.</p>

<p><br>
FRED rose when he saw that his cousin had finished reading,
and silently put down three broad silver pieces on the table.
Charley picked them up and looked at them. "How many of these are
supposed to be in the cave?"</p>

<p>"According to one of the old documents I hunted up in Batavia,
the chests contained each twenty thousand. According to another,
fifteen thousand."</p>

<p>"And you think you could find the place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with a little trouble. The site of the wreck of the
<i>Batavia</i> has long been identified; the country is all
settled, and we will turn prospectors for lead; some lodes have
been discovered about there. Will you come t I will pay all
expenses."</p>

<p>"Yes, in three weeks' time."</p>

<p>The cousins said "Good night," and were separating, when
Charley suddenly said, "Why did you not mention meeting Miss
Macdonald the other night? Do you not know that we are engaged to
be married.</p>

<p>"What! to that pretty girl I met at the Danbys'? You are a
lucky fellow, Charley!" and Fred went into his room, and shut the
door.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THREE weeks can work a wondrous change in a girl's heart;
particularly in a young girl who has led an uneventful existence
and first finds out the difference between a placid affection and
a sudden o'ermastering passion.</p>

<p>Fred was a constant visitor at the Macdonalds'; and Agnes soon
found herself gradually slipping away from her betrothed, fight
against it as she would, and surrendering herself more and more
to the attractive influence of his cousin. Charley guessed
nothing of it. He was busy at his work, and attributed the
altered manner of his betrothed to his approaching departure,
when she bade him a calmly affectionate farewell he little
thought that only a short hour before she had been weeping
passionately In Fred's embrace, and sobbing incoherently.</p>

<p>"I have only one thing to hope for. That is, that only one of
you may come back; perhaps I may learn to forget..."</p>

<p>"Am I not to come back?" whispered Fred.</p>

<p>"Oh no! You must come!" she cried; and then, breaking from his
arms, she said, "Let me go! I don't know what I am saying.
Good-bye, good-bye!" and fled from the room.</p>

<p><br>
THE cousins, on arrival in Western Australia, soon procured
horses and an outfit, and, under the pretence of looking for a
galena lode that they had heard of, made their way to the
neighbourhood of the place where Fred had located the cave. Nor
had they much trouble in finding the cave itself. A few days
search discovered the large shady tree with the bulgy trunk, now
in extreme old age. It was a kind of bottle-tree of great size an
girth, but there was no sign of any hole at its foot. Further
search, however, revealed a slab of limestone that gave forth a
hollow sound indicating a cavity beneath. They soon prised up the
slab, and revealed a small shaft-like hole slanting towards the
ridge. Lighting the candles they had provided, they scrambled
down about eight or ten feet, and found them selves in a
good-sized cave with a sandy floor, and a few stalactites
pendant. The air was good, and it was evident that the outer air
penetrated through some cracks in the roof.</p>

<p>"The third cave," said Fred. "This will be the first,"</p>

<p>They examined the walls, and found a narrow cleft through
which a man could squeeze. This brought them into another cave,
in which the air was close and oppressive. The candles emitted
but a feeble light, and the darkness surrounding them seemed
almost palpable in its blackness.</p>

<p>In this cave there were more stalactites, and in the silence
they heard the occasional drip of water. Feeling carefully round
the wall, they made the circuit of the cave without discovering
any opening. They tried again without success, only finding in
one place a number of loose slabs and boulders, as though a slip
or fall had taken place; that was all. The perspiration was now
streaming down them, and the air was so stifling that they agreed
to return and continue the search in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The second visit they brought more candles and examined the
walls most carefully; this time they were rewarded. At the spot
where the boulders were they discovered an opening only between
two and three feet in height.</p>

<p>"This must be it," said Fred; "but we shall have to crawl on
our bellies to get through."</p>

<p>The passage extended some four or five yards and it was by no
means a pleasant feeling to drag oneself along beneath the
overhanging rock, that at times seemed perilously low. Their
candles, too, went out, and it was with panting lungs and beating
hearts that they at last found themselves able to stand
upright.</p>

<p>To their pleasurable surprise, the air in this cave was better
than in the one they had just quitted, proving that there was
some opening at the other end.</p>

<p>"This is the third cave," said Fred, when he had recovered his
breath; "now for it." He struck a match and lit the candles. They
burnt well, and by their light they saw the coins they were in
search of, piled up on some slabs of limestone.</p>

<p>Charley sat down, feeling suddenly faint. Surely it must be a
dream; the whole thing had been so easily and quickly
accomplished that it was incredible. Fred approached and
inspected the hoard. They were piled neatly up, as the dead and
gone mutineer had left them, having evidently amused himself by
arranging the coins and counting them.</p>

<p>Charley now approached, and they speculated oil the best
manner of getting the money out of the cave. "A very few trips
through that passage would satisfy me," said Charley; "is there
no other way?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking," returned Fred, "that if one of us stopped in
here, and the other in the second cave, we could draw one of the
pack bags backwards and forwards. The one in here could till the
bag, and the other draw it through into the outer cave."</p>

<p>"That would do first-rate; our reins and surcingles will be
long enough to pull the bag backwards and forwards. Now let us
get above again; I long for the fresh air."</p>

<p>They retraced their steps, and determined to postpone
commencing work until the morrow, both men passed a sleepless
night, Fred was haunted by the words Agnes had uttered, scarcely
comprehending their import, "I hope that only one of you may come
back."</p>

<p>In their absence would her fickle fancy revert to Charley
again? He knew that, away from him and his influence, she would
think with regret of her old sweetheart, and yes, it would be
much better if only one came back.</p>

<p>Charley's thoughts had also been strangely troubled. The sight
of the silver had awakened hitherto unknown feelings in his
breast. His share would almost redeem the mortgage, but,
supposing he had the whole; supposing an accident happened to
Fred? He sat up, with his heart beating wildly, and looked up at
the calm stars. What could he be thinking of?</p>

<p>"Fred!" he cried, leaping to his feet; "let's saddle up and
get out of this. D&mdash;n the silver! Let it rot there. It's
cursed."</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter? Got a nightmare?" said Fred,
sitting up.</p>

<p>"No; but I would rather let that money moulder there than go
back in that cave for it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man. You're off colour. Go to sleep, we have hard
work before us tomorrow," and his cousin turned his back to him
as lie lay down again.</p>

<p>There was little conversation the next morning. They tossed up
who should go into the inside cave, and it fell to Fred. They
rigged up two leathern pack-bags with the tent-line, reins, etc.,
so that they could be drawn out full and pulled back empty, and
then started to work. Fred disappeared under the low arch and
Charley remained outside.</p>

<p>The work went on quickly, and all the time that Charley stood
in the suffocating atmosphere of the second cave something seemed
whispering in his car, "Supposing anything happened to
Fred&mdash;supposing he could not get out from that
cave&mdash;supposing something blocked up the passage?"</p>

<p>At last he could stand it no longer; he felt he must fight
this tempting devil somehow. More that half the coins had been
pulled through, and as the heap beside him grew bigger he knew
that in the end he must succumb, and that his cousin would never
leave the cave again.</p>

<p>"Fred!" he shouted through the low passage.</p>

<p>"Ullo!" came back the answer.</p>

<p>"Will you change places for a bit? I cannot stand this bad air
any longer."</p>

<p>"Right you are. I was just thinking of it."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Fred head appeared, and he dragged himself
through the aperture. Charley gave a gasp of relief; the tempter
had been exorcised. He crawled through, and the work went on.
Presently his cousin shouted to him, "How much more is
there?"</p>

<p>"Only one bag," he replied as he filled it. There was no
answer; and when he had put the remaining coins in the bag he
gave the signal to pull, there was no response. "Fred has gone
for a breath of air," he thought, and, lying down, proceeded to
wriggle under the arch. He reached the end, and his blood ran
cold with horror; Fred had blocked up the exit, even as he had
dreamt of doing.</p>

<p>He shouted and shouted, but the only answer he got was a dull
noise, as though more boulders were being piled on. Lying prone
on his stomach, he could exert no strength to push at the
obstruction, even if that would have availed him. He was buried
alive.</p>

<p>He felt he would faint if he remained there any longer, and
crawled back into the cave, where he threw himself, in the
bitterness of death, on the sandy floor.</p>

<p><br>
"HE will never come out of that," thought Fred, as he rolled
the last stone into its place; then staggered out in the fresh
air. "Oh God, what have I done for the sake of a girl who doesn't
know her own mind."</p>

<p>He remained seated for some time, then rose and looked around.
It was still early in the morning, and the day was calm and
sunny. His first fit of remorse had passed away, and an obstinate
devil had taken its place.</p>

<p>"I will have a rest, and then get the coin up here," he
thought, as he laid himself down under the shade of the mighty
tree, and wearied by the sleepless night and the morning's work,
fell asleep almost at once.</p>

<p><br>
MEANTIME Charley after the first feeling of terror had worn
off, determined to make some effort to escape It had flashed
across him that he might find the opening by which the air was
admitted that rendered the cavern wholesome.. He extinguished the
candles and waited patiently for his eyes to get accustomed to
the darkness. After a while he thought he could distinguish a
faint ray of light, and he carefully made his way towards it. It
was some distance above his head, but the wall was sloping and
broken and he managed to climb up to it.</p>

<p>There was an opening, and it was big enough for him to crawl
into. He squeezed and dragged himself along, the sharp edges of
the limestone cutting and wounding him, until at last, as he
forced himself, gasping, through a narrow crevice, he saw
distinctly daylight ahead of him. He got to it at last and found
himself, exhausted and worn out, beneath a crack through which he
could see the blue sky. But the crack was but a narrow slit
through which a child could not pass; on either side were rocks
weighing probably tons and tons, that dynamite could scarcely
move. It was but a mockery after all. He lay there some time,
then, actuated by a desire to be as near the open air as
possible, climbed up the incline that led to the slit.</p>

<p>He put his hand through it; on one side smooth rock, on the
other a narrow knife-like edge. Was it possible it was only a
thin slab of limestone on that side? He got a firmer footing, put
his back under it, and gave a mighty heave. It gave, rose, and he
stood upright, and threw it down ringing on the smooth rock
beside it; and leapt on to the earth's free surface once more. He
was on the opposite side of the ridge to where they were camped,
and he made his way over the low crest towards it.</p>

<p>There was no one in the camp; Fred was probably below,
securing the money. Charley descended. No one in the first cave;
no one in the second; but the stones that blocked the entrance of
the narrow passage had been rolled away. Charley felt his heart
thrill with pleasure. His cousin had come back to release him
after all. He stooped and listened, and heard Fred calling his
name in the third cave.</p>

<p>"Here I am," he shouted.</p>

<p><br>
FRED woke up out of his sleep with a sudden start, the cold
perspiration on his forehead. What had happened! He had left his
cousin to die a lingering death in the dark. He would never sleep
again, he knew and felt. Was Agnes Macdonald worth the torture he
should evermore feel?</p>

<p>Without stopping to think, he jumped down the hole and made
his way into the cave. Working like a fiend, he tore down the
boulders he had piled up, and crawled through as soon as the
opening was large enough.</p>

<p>"Charley! Charley!" he shouted, "it was only a stupid joke of
mine, but I fell asleep, or I would have been back before."</p>

<p>There was no answer to his cries, and he searched frantically
around, expecting to find his cousin lying senseless. Again he
shouted, and a voice, seemingly from the ground, said, "Here I
am!"</p>

<p>It came through the low passage he had just traversed.</p>

<p>"Fred," said Charles Marshall, as they stood at the top of the
hole, "shall we do as I said last night&mdash;leave this cursed,
blood-stained silver to rot where it is? I was nearly playing the
same stupid joke on you that you did on me. There is nothing to
forgive between us."</p>

<p>Fred held out his hand; they filled up the hole with boulders,
replaced the slab of limestone, confident that the next
thunderstorm would hide all trace of their visit. Then they rode
away, and left the mutineer's hoard to the darkness where it had
been hid so long.</p>

<p><br>
ONLY one cousin returned to New South Wales. Fred had business
elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is presumed that occasionally husband and wife can keep
secrets from each other. For to this day Agnes Marshall does not
know of her husband's imprisonment in the cave. Nor does Charley
know that it was not on account of the treasure that Fred shut
him up there.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>17. &mdash; A TALE OF VANDERLIN ISLAND</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 11 Aug 1894</h3>

<h3>Collected in "My Only Murder and Other Tales," 1899</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
On Maparunga, the Canoe-Maker; and What he Did Not Know.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
MAPARUNGA was noted amongst his tribe as a clever fashioner of
canoes. His people were sea-coast blacks of Carpentaria, having
their abode principally on the Sir Edward Pellew Group of
Islands. The canoes used by this people were not the common kind
of rude and hasty manufacture. They were far more cunningly
contrived. Sheets of pliable bark were cut to a particular
pattern so that when pieced together they fitted harmoniously
into the shape of a really presentable little craft. These strips
of bark had to be sewn to each other with currajong string and
the seams next rudely caulked; then, when an outrigger had been
fixed on, she was ready for inter-island navigation, and could
stand some rough weather, too.</p>

<p>Now, Maparunga was a born shipwright in his humble, aboriginal
way, and could manage a canoe after building it, and, moreover,
could conceal it in so dexterous a manner beneath the mangroves,
or up an inlet, as to look like part of its surroundings. This
accomplishment was one often needed in the flight or pursuit of
native warfare, when to swim across a creek swarming with sharks
and alligators meant certain death. As yet the whites of this
generation had not troubled the waters surrounding this lonely
group. In the days probably of Maparunga's great-grandfather a
bluff-bowed ship had come there and stayed some time, the crew
boating about, sounding, and using strange instruments. Finally,
they had gone away with, if the natives only knew it, their
island homes neatly charted and named by that captain who earned
a deathless name for himself. Only the long, red island of
Vanderlin retained the name given by the old Dutch sailor who saw
it from a distance and called it Cape Vanderlin.</p>

<p>But Dutch and English had gone and their coming been forgotten
in one generation, for black tradition lives but from father to
son. Even the dusky Malays who once sailed their proas to the
coast fishing for <i>bche-de-mer</i>, and who fought with the
aborigines, had ceased their visits for many years, and were
almost forgotten. So Maparunga, the canoe-maker, had never seen
anyone but men of his own race. True, he had heard dimly of the
whites from the natives of the mainland, but they came not
through the broad fringe of mangrove swamps and slimy, oozy
creeks; nor from the sea as Flinders had come; and Maparunga knew
nothing of ships, save the light, frail vessels he built so
well.</p>

<p>Maparunga had his camp in the inlet that bites into the middle
of Centre Island. The camp was on a beach of pure, white sand
laved by a sea of brilliant blue, so clear that fish and plants a
fathom or so deep looked as though one could lean over the canoe
side and grasp them. Behind were low, abrupt hills, rock-crowned,
with jungle half-way up their sides out of which shot up here and
there a tall and beautiful palm.</p>

<p>The sun was declining, and Maparunga's attention was drawn to
the approach of his gin laden with the afternoon's hunting
spoils. As he licked his lips in anticipation, a shrill call from
the highest of the rocks behind him made him jump up and look. A
blackfellow&mdash;Nimpoo, of his own tribe, and a friend of
his&mdash;stood there beckoning eagerly, and Maparunga hastened
through a native path in the jungle, up to the boulder-strewn
summit, and joined the other. There Nimpoo grasped his shoulder
and pointed northward, and away past the jutting-out reef of
Craggie Island, on which the white surf never stops from
breaking, they saw a strange and wonderful thing.</p>

<p>It was a great sea beast with white wings coming steadily on
between Craggie Island and Vanderlin as though it was going to
run right on to the black bank of mud and mangrove that marked
the mainland.</p>

<p>Then Maparunga called to his wife, and she and his children
and all in the camp covered up the fires with sand and ran into
the jungle; and all the blacks watched the strange beast until
it came right opposite to where they were, but much closer to the
red rocks of Vanderlin Island, and then, the strange thing from
the wide sea where canoes cannot go far, shut up its wings and
stopped, and the blacks watched it until the sun sank behind them
over the top of West Island, where there is always good water and
sometimes good roots to eat.</p>

<p>"When it is dark it will come over and eat us up," said the
wife of Maparunga. "I shall stop in the scrub all night."</p>

<p>And the others all said the same except Nimpoo and Maparunga.
They, too, watched with the others until two lights burned on the
beast, and that was all they could see of it. Then Maparunga and
Nimpoo got a canoe and went in the darkness to look at the beast
with wings. But they did not paddle straight across, for they
were cautious, as all of their race. They went across the open
sea between them and South West Island; on by the dark mangroves
and black shadows where there are so many creeks, where at night
the alligators splash and grunt in the mud. Still keeping their
eyes on the two lights burning on the beast, Maparunga, the
canoe-maker, and Nimpoo, his friend, paddled on, not frightened
at the strange noises they heard to their right, for they were
used to them. At last they reached the southern end of Vanderlin
Island, and crept on close in shore until they were opposite the
beast, then they stopped and listened, and heard men's voices,
and both guessed at once that it was a great big canoe and no
beast, for, though they could not understand what was spoken,
they knew they were men like themselves that they heard. Softly
they paddled out, for it was a dark night, and went round and
round the big canoe, and heard men talking loudly, as men talk
before they fight. Then they went straight back, across the open
water, and not round the long way by the mangrove shore; for they
were much braver men now that they had found out what it was.</p>

<p>For a long half century, ever since the <i>Endeavour</i> had
weighed her anchor, the silent group had been unvisited and
unseen by Europeans. Now, a schooner had come down through the
lifeless Carpenterian sea; wherein there is never a sail, and
seldom a bird; and anchored under Vanderlin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
What Maparunga Saw on the Island of Vanderlin</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
WHEN the two natives arrived at their camps, they reassured
the others, but told them to keep close, for the men might be bad
men. Then, they took some food in the canoe and started back in
the darkness to the island of red rocks. When they reached there,
Maparunga, who was so skilful, hid the canoe so that no one could
find it, and the two went high among the rocks, ate their food,
and waited.</p>

<p>When the light came and the sun rose behind Vanderlin, they
saw men on the big canoe moving about, and presently a little
canoe, like their own, only bigger, fell into the water, and
men&mdash;more than they knew how to count, came down the side of
the big canoe into the small one. Four of them&mdash;they could
count that number&mdash;sat by themselves, and four others, all
alike, sat down one after the other, and, putting out long
paddles, made the canoe move to the land.</p>

<p>Right below where the natives were hidden was a sandy beach,
and to this the canoe came, turned round, and the four men who
sat together got out, but the others stopped in the canoe. The
four men walked off together a little way along the sand, and
then they parted, and two walked away from the other two, but
only for a short distance. After a very little while one man
again walked away from each of the two, and left them standing
turned partly away from each other. Suddenly, the two men turned
their heads round, lifted one arm, and there was such lightning
and thunder came out of their hands that Maparunga and Nimpoo
were too frightened to look; but they both heard a shriek like a
gin's come across the sea from the big canoe.</p>

<p>When they looked up again one man was lying on the sand, with
blood coming from him like a native who is speared, but the
others all stood upright. Then two men went and looked at the one
fallen down; then they came back to the man who stood quietly
there, and said something to him, to which he bent his head.
Next, they turned away and went back to the canoe; here one of
the men who had waited put some things on the sand, and then four
men came and carried the dead man away, and they all went back in
the little canoe to the big one. The man who was left behind
watched them go, standing quite still until the big canoe put up
her white wings and moved away towards the sea where there is no
one living. Then he lifted one hand, shook it, calling out aloud,
and turning away put both hands before his eyes.</p>

<p>Maparunga and Nimpoo, watching the big canoe, saw something
white fall from it into the sea. The big canoe turned round
partly, a little canoe dropped into the water quickly, men jumped
in, paddled off and, picking the white thing out of the sea
again, took it back to the big canoe, and the big canoe went on,
on, out of sight. Now, although Maparunga and Nimpoo saw this,
the man did not, for when they turned to look at him again he was
sitting on a rock with his head still buried in his hands.</p>

<p>This is the end of what Maparunga and Nimpoo saw on the Island
of Vanderlin; only that the white man left behind made friends
with them, and lived with their tribe for many years teaching
them good things, until one day old Maparunga, the clever maker
of canoes, told him of the white thing he and Nimpoo saw fall
from the big canoe. Then the white man got very sad, and when
they heard from other tribes that more white men were living on
the mainland beyond the mangroves, he got them to take him up the
salt-water river to some friendly tribes who knew the whites, and
who took him on to his own people, for he never came back. But to
the day of his death old Maparunga, the clever maker of canoes,
looked out each morning to see a big canoe with wings coming from
the sea where no man lives, bringing his white friend back
again.</p>

<p><br>
"IN a certain year, which I need not particularise, I, Lloyd
Broughton, then newly-married, started on a long voyage in a
schooner-rigged yacht, owned by two intimate friends of mine. On
board were the two brothers Grenow, the owners of the yacht, my
wife and her brother. We were out many months and visited Java,
and touched at several other islands in the Coral Sea. Then, as
my wife was anxious to see real savage, uncivilised country, we
made south to the north coast of Australia, which we understood
to be then unsettled. This led us to the scene of my crime and
its expiation. If ever I loved a human being I loved my young
wife. But I am, or was, of a morbidly jealous nature; one of the
wretched self-tormentors of this world who seek out doubts to
construe and torture them into confirmation of their own vile and
degrading suspicions. If any man who reads this does not know who
jealousy destroys a man's best impulses and changes his nature,
let him humbly thank his Maker.</p>

<p>"Being so long on board together, this hateful thing within me
led me to suspect that my wife's affections had been transferred
to the younger Grenow. Now, as I, a dying man, solemnly declare,
there never was the slightest reason for such a wicked thought.
And I am confident to the day of her death that my unhappy wife's
affection for me was unaltered; even after my crime of murdering
the innocent man whom I wrongly suspected.</p>

<p>"Seeing then that no one but myself could have suspected the
delusion that I at last believed to be the truth, my fatal
outbreak of rage and wrath excited an almost equal storm of
indignation in the other three men. We were just then sighting
some part of the South Coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, a group
of islands called the Sir Edward Pellew Group. I had conceived
the wild idea that our purpose in visiting that lonely, unknown
part was to leave me on shore&mdash;desert me, in fact, as
opportunity offered. Nobody but a man goaded by jealousy, who is,
after all, a madman, could have believed such a thought could be
harboured in the breasts of my wife or my friends. In the end I
was left&mdash;but, justly.</p>

<p>"My rage was so violent that they at last thought me mad, and
were about to confine me, when I grew quite calm and insulted the
younger Grenow so grossly and vilely that I awakened in him, his
brother, and my wife's brother, a mortal hatred equal to my own.
That night we anchored close to a long, low island, with red,
bare rocks on it. Our arrangements were made, and the conditions
have been faithfully kept by all but me. I am murderer and
perjurer&mdash;both.</p>

<p>"We were to proceed ashore and fight at sunrise, the
conditions agreed to being that, after the duel, the survivor
stayed on the island alone, bound never to return to Europe if he
lived. This was what I insisted on in order that if I fell my
adversary should not return in the yacht with my wife.</p>

<p>"We landed, and I shot Grenow through the heart at the first
fire. I wonder his brother did not shoot me, but the conditions
were honourably observed on their side, and I was left alive on
the uninhabited island of Vanderlin.</p>

<p>"No sooner was the deed done and I alone, than the devil that
had tempted me deserted me. At once remorse opened my eyes to the
hideous crime of which I had been guilty. I had aspersed the fame
of the woman I loved best on earth, murdered my friend, reduced
myself to the condition of a worse than outcast Cain.</p>

<p>"From the depths of my anguish I was roused by the timid
approach of two natives; they were friendly, and for years I
lived with their tribe expiating my offence in the miserably
degraded life of a savage.</p>

<p>"I taught then what I could, toying to do something in return
for my wasted life; but O, the hideous agony of those years of
lonely remorse! One day old Maparunga, one of my rescuers, told
me that he saw a white object drop from the side of the yacht and
it was immediately rescued by a boat. At once the conviction
flashed across me&mdash;a conviction I now know to be
true&mdash;that my poor wife, hearing of my fate, had sprung
overboard to try to swim to join me.</p>

<p>"From that moment I could rest no more; I must go back, in
spite of my vow, make full confession of the injustice of my
accusations, and die. I was no longer fit to live, even amongst
savages.</p>

<p>"Hearing that white men were settling on the mainland I
persuaded the blacks to take me to another friendly tribe, and so
finally joined my countrymen. In time I worked to the more
settled parts and earned enough to pay my passage to London. Here
I found some friends who remembered me, and from them I learned
that I was too late; my wife died of grief before the yacht
reached home. I was doomed not even to make such wretched
expiation as I tried to, I contrived to let the elder Grenow know
of my return, and he at once demanded the fulfilment of the
conditions&mdash;namely, that if the survivor broke his oath and
returned he should either give himself up a self-confessed
murderer, or kill himself. Since then he has sent me word to keep
my wretched life, but this I do not want. I am writing this to
send him as a proof of the wicked injustice of my charge against
his brother."</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>18. &mdash; BREWSTER'S AFFLICTED DOG</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 Dec 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
'I ONLY found out what ailed the dog by accident,' said Jim.
'You see, it was this way. The dog was not an ordinary dog, but
it possessed another identity, a what-do-you-call-it? An astral
body, or something of that sort. Quite unexpectedly this poor
dog's being would be projected into space somewhere, and then the
form that was left could do nothing but sit on end and howl until
the spirit returned. This was rough on the dog, and also on
Brewster, for he was continually having to fight people for
kicking his dog because the brute howled so. Sometimes, too, the
astral dog would come back and sit down and jeer at his own body
and refuse to go inside, and that body could do nothing in return
but howl; so the dog lived in considerable hot water.</p>

<p>'Now, there happened to be on the station a young fellow,
horse-breaking, who was just the ordinary kind of bush hand,
without a spark of imagination, and he and Brewster were always
at loggerheads about the afflicted dog. His name was Cotten, and
he particularly disliked being kept awake by the howls of the
dog. One night the dog was perfectly quiet, strange to say,
and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How did you find out about the dog's astral body, Jim?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'Well this way&mdash;it was the only theory that seemed
feasible, and, as the dog never contradicted it, I came to the
conclusion that it was true. However, the dog, although the
actual cause of the trouble, was not the chief actor in it.
Cotten and Brewster had to go out together early that morning
after the quiet night I spoke about, and Brewster hunted high and
low for his afflicted dog and found him not. He accused Cotten of
having made away with the animal, and they came to high words,
and called each other the usual number of scarlet liars. They
went away together still quarrelling; but only one came back, and
that was Cotten. He told a fairy tale that when they were out
together they saw two dogs racing through the scrub. The first
one didn't try to dodge trees or anything, but seemed to let the
trees pass through his body; the other one in pursuit had to slew
about all roads, and lost, ground.</p>

<p>'"There's my dog!" cried Brewster, and started after him as
hard as he could lick. Cotten was not such a fool as to go
pelting through a thick gidea and brigalow scrub after another
man's dog, so he waited where he was, but Brewster did not come
back, so he came home. Next morning we turned out to look for
Brewster, and, true enough, we found him with a broken leg.</p>

<p>'He was very bad for some time, but at last he began to pull
around; but Cotten had to keep away from him, the sight of him
excited him so. He declared that Cotten had been up to some
tricks with his dog, and blamed him for his broken leg.</p>

<p>'Now, I believe Cotten was quite right in what he saw, or said
that he saw, and could no more have invented the yarn than he
could have flown; as I said, he hadn't a spark of
imagination&mdash;he couldn't even tell a decent lie without
being found out. The afflicted dog turned up about a week after
the accident, miserably poor and thin; but he seemed to have no
life in him, and there was a vacant look in his eyes, and, in my
opinion, his astral body bad succeeded in giving him the slip for
good.</p>

<p>'Brewster gradually got better, and at last was able to hop
about on crutches. Certainly, he confirmed what Cotten had
related, but, at the same time, he seemed to think that Cotten
had cast some unholy spell on the dog, which, at any rate, proved
that Brewster had imagination, for the idea, of Cotten knowing
anything about "unholy spells" was too immense. The only thing
Cotten knew about "spells," that I can think of was when he
wrote a letter once a year, and used to put his head down on the
table, and stretch his tongue out and curl it round, while he
asked somebody if r-a-n-e-s spelt reins.'</p>

<p>'Oh, hang it, Jim! What the deuce has Cotten's spelling to do
with Brewster's dog?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, I admit But, at any rate, the dog pined away and
died&mdash;that is to say, that empty frame of the dog died; and
then the tragedy happened.</p>

<p>'You see, Brewster's leg had not set well, and he was bound to
limp for the rest of his life, and that made him cranky,
and&mdash;between ourselves&mdash;a bit off his chump, and this
dislike of Cotten had become a regular craze, until at last the
place became unbearable, and the owner told them that, one must
leave. Brewster was the best man of the two before this
accident, but what with that and his cranky temper he was mot
much good, so he had to go.</p>

<p>'You can imagine that this did not improve his feelings
towards Cotten, and when he had his cheque and his horses were
brought in, he broke out and threatened Cotten, who sat with has
mouth open all the time, not half understanding what it was all
about. He was very bitter, and just as he was riding away he
forgot himself and whistled to his dog, not remembering that the
dog was dead.</p>

<p>'The Chinese cook swore that when Brewster whistled, a dog,
just like his, came from somewhere and trotted off at the horse's
heels. None of the rest of us saw it.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear you admit that, Jim.'</p>

<p>'Brewster went away and five days afterwards Cotten's horse
came home without Cotten on his back. Of course, we ran the
tracks back until dark without success, and had to give it up
until the next morning. For although we tried tracking with
firesticks and matches we made no fist of it, and had to give it
up. There was, of course, no suspicion of foul play, for Cotten
had been riding a green colt; and anything might have happened.
We camped where we were, and to the middle of the night we were
aroused by a most doleful howl.</p>

<p>'"Hang the dingos!" said one fellow.</p>

<p>'"Dingos?" said another; "them's no dingos; that's Brewster's
dog!"</p>

<p>'We all of us listened intently. Sure enough, when the howl
went up again, we all recognised it as the howl of Brewster's
dog. The dog we knew had been dead for weeks. I tell you it was a
very unpleasant camp for the rest of the night. In the morning we
started off on the tracks at the first glimmer, and about 10
o'clock we found poor Cotten dead as a herring.</p>

<p>'What's worse, though, he had been killed. It was no accident.
There had been a fight and Cotten had been stabbed with a sheath
knife.</p>

<p>'Of course everybody said "Brewster!" and with good reason, as
it afterwards turned, out.</p>

<p>'One of us went back for the tray buggy the rations were
carried on, and Cotten's body was taken in and the police sent
for.</p>

<p>'Of course they could do nothing but agree with us that it was
probably Brewster; but the question was to find Brewster.</p>

<p>'Now, you may think us very stupid, but none of us thought of
connecting the howling of that dog that night with the
disappearance of Brewster, and it was not till a dog came and
howled round the quarters all one night that we thought anything
about it. Then Dick Mathers said to me at breakfast, "Do you
remember that dog howling that night we were tracking
Cotten?"</p>

<p>'"Of course I did."</p>

<p>'"Well, it's my opinion that it was the same dog as was round
here last night. Do you think, if we could get leave to go out
and camp there, we could fix that spot?"</p>

<p>'"I am pretty well sure of it."</p>

<p>'"Then, let's go."</p>

<p>'To make a long story short we went, and while we were trying
to get the right direction, there came the howl again. There was
a very fair moon, so Dick and I started after it, and presently,
at a bit of an opening, we came to the spot. A dog was
certainly sitting there howling, but he seemed to vanish as we
came up; but there was something else that did not vanish, and
that was the body of Brewster, hanging to a tree.'</p>

<p>Jim paused, and I was just going to say good night, when he
spoke again.</p>

<p>'I just want to ask you a question. There's that there astral
dog still wandering about somewhere, and I want to know what's
become of him? The other dog is a skeleton long ago, so he can't
get back there. Has he got to wander around forever?'</p>

<p>'He shouldn't have been such a fool as to project himself out
of the other body,' I said. 'It's his look-out anyhow. I suppose
the story is true?'</p>

<p>'Quite true,' said Jim, as he went off into the sleep of
innocence.</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>19. &mdash; JIMBRAS OF WEST AUSTRALIA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 13 Feb 1897</h3>

<p class="cp">
<i>Jimbras, bunyips,  and the like were some of the mythical
creatures widely<br>
believed, in the 19th century, to exist in the vast, unexplored
outback. &mdash;TW.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE things here related happened in West Australia, many years
ago, in the early days of the gold discoveries. I have constantly
expected to hear more of the matter since, but have not done so,
but it will come some day.</p>

<p>Camels were not so common then as they are now, and my mate
and I had pushed out prospecting with horses, which were used to
the country, and in excellent condition. We got well out into the
interior, having been lucky in getting water, but not very lucky
in prospecting. One afternoon we came on a little family of
blacks camped at a bit of a rock-hole, and managed to make
friends with them. There was a white-headed old man, two gins,
and three or four kids. When they got used to us we tried to get
something out of them about the country ahead, but were not very
successful. The old man, whose name was Boodgin, gave us to
understand that there was water and hills up to the north-east,
but was urgent in explaining to us not to go there. He kept on
repeating the word "Jimbra," "Jimbra," but we could not
understand him. He seemed much hurt at his failure to explain
himself, seizing us by the arms, and squeezing them, grinning
horribly the while.</p>

<p>We concluded that jimbra meant some sort of animal, but could
not place it anyhow. Next morning the old man took us to the top
of the rock mound, and showed us the hills he had spoken of far
off to the north-east. They looked only a short day's journey, so
after giving the blacks some trifling presents, we started. It
was mostly desert country, until we reached the neighborhood of
the hills, when we struck a creek, and a most encouraging change
took place. Following the channel, it at last led us into a
little pocket amongst the ridges, fairly grassed and timbered.
Here we found a small soak, or spring, sufficient for our wants.
We had not seen any sign of blacks, so camped with great
satisfaction, for we had not expected to get half such a good
camp. In the middle of the night I awoke, and the air being a
trifle chilly, I got up and put the fire together. The flames
blazed up cheerily, and I lit my pipe and squatted beside it,
half asleep and half awake.</p>

<p>Suddenly across the fire I saw a face&mdash;a black face, but
not the face of a blackfellow. What the exact difference was I
could not then tell, for I was too much taken by surprise, but it
was more revolting and horrifying than any face I had ever seen,
but it was still human. Then it flashed across me that it was
there for no good, but as I grabbed for my revolver the thing
vanished in the darkness, and I heard its quick retreating
footsteps. I did not fire for fear of hitting one of the horses,
not knowing exactly where they were. I roused up my mate,
Bergholm, and told him of my adventure, which he scarcely
believed until morning broke, and we looked up the tracks, and
they were those of a man.</p>

<p>The horses were all well, and as we ate our breakfast we made
our plans for the day, which included looking up our nocturnal
visitor. Taking two riding horses, we proceeded to inspect the
pocket wherein we found ourselves. It was a wonderful little
patch of country to exist in such an isolated manner in the midst
of the desert, and what made it more remarkable was the luxuriant
way in which the trees grew on the banks of the creek&mdash;they
were as close together as if they were on some coast creek in a
temperate climate.</p>

<p>We found two or three likely patches for prospecting, and
presently, towards the middle of the day, returned to our camp to
follow up the track of our intruder. It did not go far, only to
the bank of the creek, where it strangely disappeared, and
nothing could we further find of it, although we were both fair
trackers.</p>

<p>During our inspection of the valley we had noticed native
tracks, but no sign of any camp. In the afternoon I proposed we
should go up one of the highest hills and see, if possible, how
far the good country extended. Selecting one with a good spur, up
which we could ride or lead our horses, we started. The last part
was rather rough, and we had to lead our horses up to the crest.
From the top we had a fine view, the range, which was surrounded
by the good country, seemed quite isolated, and we could see the
distant desert seemingly all round it. Various other gullies like
the one we were camped in, ran down to the different points of
the compass, and, in fact, the place seemed like an island in a
sea of aridity.</p>

<p>After noting all we could we descended, and had reached that
part of the spur where we could ride again, when suddenly a huge
boulder came bounding down the hill straight after us. We were
just mounting, and the blessed thing shot past us like a steam
engine, luckily not giving us a chance to try and dodge it or we
should have probably got right in its road. We pushed on as fast
as we could, but another came thundering down, though wide of the
mark. When we got in a moderately safe place we stopped and
looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Is that your friend of last night?" said Bergholm.</p>

<p>"He'd better not show himself any more," I returned, "or he'll
get a bullet through him on spec."</p>

<p>We rode home feeling rather uncomfortable&mdash;it was not
pleasant to have such neighbors. On our way back we were riding
by the bank of the creek underneath the trees I spoke of, when
suddenly there was a sharp crack overhead, and a dead limb of the
tree we were under came crashing down. Our horses had naturally
started of their own accord at the rending, breaking noise above
their heads, and the limb fell clear of us. We stared in wonder
at each other, but it was impossible to say whether the
occurrence was natural or not. The limb was dead and ripe for
falling, and we could detect no trace of any one up in the tree;
but, taken in conjunction with the boulders, it was a very
similar coincidence.</p>

<p>We made up a roaring fire and kept it going all night, keeping
watch by turns. Nothing happened, but some distance away we found
many native tracks, as though somebody had been prowling about.
In the morning we went to one of the places we had noticed the
day before, and did a little prospecting. We got a small show in
a reef, but nothing very wonderful, and about midday I went back
to camp to get the midday meal ready, leaving Bergholm pottering
about the reef.</p>

<p>I was riding quietly, and when I got close to the camp, I
suddenly saw there was somebody there. I pulled up, and watched.
It was a naked black, a hideous-looking being. Shock-headed, with
no forehead, and projecting jaw, long arms and body and short
legs, he was the type of all that was fearsome and revolting. He
was wandering through the camp picking up things, and seemingly
trying them with his teeth; some he twisted and threw away. I had
come up under cover of a bit of scrub, and was pretty close.
Remembering the boulders, the dead limb, and witnessing the
destruction of our property in this manner, I did not hesitate in
getting out my rifle and firing at the brute.</p>

<p>I hit him in the body, and he fell, but jumped up again, and
bit at the wound like a hurt dog, and then took to his heels, and
ran to the creek with astonishing speed, I after him. He reached
the bank first, but the loss of blood was too much for him, and
he fell, gasping. I cautiously got off, and approached him,
keeping my rifle ready. He glared at me out of his small red
eyes, and made an effort to rise, but it was in vain. While I was
looking at him wonderingly, Bergholm came galloping up to see
what I was firing at.</p>

<p>"Good God! what a monster!" he exclaimed, and at the moment I
fairly screamed with pain. Incautiously I had stood too near the
monster, and, throwing out one hand, it caught me round the
ankle.</p>

<p>Never did a man feel such a grip of physical force. The
relentless crushing of machinery is all that I can compare to it.
The agony was so awful, as though the bone was being pulverised
beneath the pressure, that I blew the brute's brains out with my
rifle, and dropped almost fainting.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together after a bit, and we examined the
monster closely, and measured him. The thickness of his body was
enormous, and the length of arms, his legs were short, and did
not display the abnormal strength of his arms. His head was human
in shape, and that was all you could say, for otherwise it was
that of a brute.</p>

<p>I examined my ankle, and though there was nothing actually
broken; it was still almost numb with pain, and I could only
stand with Bergholm's help.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a nice crowd we have got amongst," he said. "If
this is your friend of the other night, I suppose his sisters and
his cousins and his aunts will be inquiring after him."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so. Let's get back to camp, and see what damage
he has done."</p>

<p>It was fearful pain having to limp to the camp, but I did it
somehow. It was in great disorder; our quart pots were squeezed
flat by the creature's grip, a pack-saddle torn up, and the iron
twisted as one might twist a piece of wire.</p>

<p>"It's lucky he didn't find one of us in the camp," said
Bergholm. "Well, he's not done very much damage after all; let's
have some grub and discuss the best thing to do."</p>

<p>"By Jove, these must be Jimbras that old man was so anxious to
warn us about," I said.</p>

<p>As if in answer to what I said, a shrill cry arose behind me,
and, looking round, we saw a white haired old nigger making signs
to us.</p>

<p>"By Jove, it's that old Boodgin come after us," said Bergholm,
and beckoned to him. Whether the old man had really followed us
to see how we were getting on, or in the hopes of getting a few
pickings in case we had been killed I am unable to say, but he
was very glad to see us, and mighty hungry and thirsty, too.</p>

<p>"Jimbra!" he exclaimed when he saw I was crippled. I nodded,
and after we had finished eating Bergholm took him down to the
dead body. They returned after some time, Bergholm looking rather
upset.</p>

<p>"We're in a nice fix," he said, "that is if we stop here.
These Jimbras are a nice crowd; they live mostly in the trees, it
seems, and have the strength of about ten men. They catch these
poor devils of niggers when they camp here, and how do you think
they kill them? Why get them against a tree, and put their arms
round and crush them. Pfaugh! there are bones against every tree
along there."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Well, we can go straight away, but there's a good show, and I
don't believe in being frightened away by a lot of man-monkeys.
We might camp out side, and keep watch. Old Boodgin says they
don't venture out where the trees are small and far apart. We
could carry water out and bring the horses in to feed, and old
Boodgin to keep watch while we work."</p>

<p>"That'll do; its a pity to leave this place without giving it
a good try; and if there was a rush set in I'm afraid the
jimbras would have to go. I must try and get my leg right as soon
as I can."</p>

<p>"Boodgin says that these gullies are full of them, and that
they must eat one another."</p>

<p>Just then there was a fierce yell from the creek, and we both
saw a jimbra come swiftly down one of the trees, and disappear
under the bank, having apparently gone to the body. Next minute
it appeared coming desperately towards us.</p>

<p>"Good God! it's a woman!" said Bergholm, "we must shoot
her."</p>

<p>It seemed a fearful thing to pull trigger on a woman, but she
was mad with rage at the death of her mate, and it was her life
or one of ours.</p>

<p>"Together," I said, and the two bullets stopped her half way.
It was not safe policy to fire together, but neither Bergholm nor
I wanted to know whose bullet it was.</p>

<p>Her cry seemed to have raised the jimbras in all directions,
for now they answered all round, and nearly twenty must have
appeared from all quarters approaching us.</p>

<p>"Fire to wound them," said Bergholm, and when they came within
shot I did so, and it was good policy, for the wounded ones
snarled and shrieked, and the others came round to look at the
wounds, and altogether it was the most horrid sight one ever saw.
They soon had enough of it; and retired discomfited; and we
proceeded to follow out Bergholm's suggestion.</p>

<p>Old Boodgin was greatly elated at seeing these terrible
enemies put to flight, and he was of great use to us finding the
nearest available camp which, in his opinion, was safe from the
jimbras. We kept a couple of horses tethered, for naturally the
main body made back to the better grass in the pocket, and it
would not do to venture in there on foot after them.</p>

<p>And so for some days we kept at work, but such a ghastly
experience I never had. I forget to say that the same night the
two bodies of the male and female jimbras were both devoured,
picked clean to the bones. Grim, cruel faces would suddenly peer
out of the foliage overhead, a hideous figure making threatening
gestures in the distance; but we had given them too good a
lesson for them to come near us. We visited most of the other
gullies, and, sooth to tell, got little for our pains. There was
gold there, but we got no show worth speaking of. We scarcely
gave the place a fair trial, for those awful jimbras got on our
nerves, and haunted us day and night. They never touched our
horses, I think they must have got fooling round one, a noted
kicker, and he had established a funk.</p>

<p>My ankle got a little easier, and I could walk a bit, when one
day we were working at the reef, old Boodgin, as usual, on the
look-out, when Bergholm got a bit of stone in one eye. He tried
to get it out by bathing it in a quarter pot, but it did not come
out, and thoughtlessly he started down to the creek to bathe it.
Old Boodgin had been looking another way, and only turned round
as Bergholm's head disappeared. Instantly he went almost frantic,
dancing and yelling, which awoke me to the sense of the danger,
and I, too, shouted to Bergholm to come back. For answer there
came a wild scream for help, and snatching up my rifle I ran as
hard as I could to the bank, accompanied by Boodgin.</p>

<p>Too late. A huge jimbra had caught Bergholm, thrown him
across his shoulder like a child, and was running at full speed
across the creek. I could not fire at his body for fear I should
hit my mate, and although I fired at the creature's legs, my hand
shook so through running with my lame leg across the hot and
heavy sand that I missed him, and he reached the further bank
unhurt, and disappeared among the tree trunks. I could follow him
by Bergholm's cries, and the jimbra soon began to climb a thickly
foliaged tree.</p>

<p>Try as I would I could not get a shot at him as he ascended,
until at last, with a mighty spring, he bounded on to the next
tree, one of the tallest gums in that part of the creek. Now I
saw him distinctly, but a successful shot would bring them both
down, and the fall would be fatal to Bergholm.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to my horror, the brute, seemingly hanging on by his
feet and one hand, held his victim out by the back of the neck,
shaking him as if in sport over the drop. As he turned back to
the tree I saw Bergholm clasp the trunk desperately with his arms
and legs.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I yelled, and fired, but my unsteady hand only
inflicted a sharp flesh wound; fortunately, it was the best thing
that could have happened. Leaving hold of his prey for a moment
he roared and shook his huge hand at me below, as I jammed in
another cartridge. In doing this he exposed the whole of his
great breast, and the next minute the bullet went through it. He
dropped like a stone, leaving Bergholm clinging despairingly to
the trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was a limb not far below him, and be
managed to slip down into the fork, where he could rest. His
position was still critical. How I was to get him down the long
naked trunk, after being half squeezed to death by those arms,
now helpless enough I did not know. Although I couldn't catch
sight of the brutes, I knew many of the tribe had been attracted
by the firing, and were watching around unseen. What to do I knew
not.</p>

<p>Presently old Boodgin touched me, and made motions like the
chopping of a tomahawk, and then pointed to himself. I guessed
what he meant. He would cut steps after the manner of a
blackfellow, and go up and help Bergholm down. It was just the
thing; and then I felt cold, very cold. The tomahawk was at the
reef. How could it be got? The reef was very probably held by the
jimbras, and I could not leave my watch over Bergholm to go and
disperse them and get the tomahawk. Then Boodgin did a very brave
thing. He motioned that he would go and get the tomahawk.</p>

<p>I hesitated. I could go half way and protect him; no jimbras
could reach Bergholm in that time, and if the camp was clear
Boodgin might be quick enough to get there and back before the
brutes could descend. I made him understand that I would come
half way, and we started. Being a myall nigger I could not trust
him with a revolver, otherwise there would not have been so much
danger.</p>

<p>Arrived half way Boodgin darted off like a startled wallaby,
and I went back, only just in time. A jimbra had just jumped on
to the gum tree, intending to bring Bergholm down. He was plain
potting for me, and two shots brought him headlong in the creek
beside his comrade. In a minute or two I heard brave old Boodgin
running and panting, For a wonder they had not visited the camp,
being too much engaged, I suppose, in the capture of
Bergholm.</p>

<p>I made Boodgin understand to cut the notches deeper, and not
so far apart as usual. I was greatly afraid that they would
spring on him when he was passing the place where the two had
already sprung, and made him understand to cut the notches on the
opposite side of the tree. He had brought me Bergholm's rifle
from the camp, so that I had-two instantaneous shots handy. It
was a weary time watching Boodgin's progress, and it must have
been terribly hard for him, but he was tough, When he approached
the ticklish spot I thought I detected a movement in the foliage
of the next tree, so fired on chance. I brought down my man. He
hung by one arm, and I let him hang, for he kept any more away
until Boodgin was up above, Then I dropped him, to lie alongside
the others.</p>

<p>When Boodgin reached Bergholm he found him in great pain from
the terrible squeezing he had undergone, but cheered up by the
presence of somebody he mustered up what strength he had left to
make an effort to descend. Boodgin descended first, placing
Bergholm's feet in the notches he had cut, and slowly and
painfully they at last reached the ground.</p>

<p>The jimbras still kept themselves concealed with wonderful
art, and after much pain and trouble we reached the reef. The
jimbras had gone there as soon as Boodgin had paid his flying
visit, and destroyed everything, but that didn't matter much. Our
horses had fled away a short distance; they took everything with
supreme indifference. Bergholm could scarcely ride to camp, but
by making slow progress I managed to get him there, and much
relieved I felt.</p>

<p>Bergholm was wild for vengeance. The horror of that moment
when the jimbra held him out from the tree would remain for ever
in his memory, and he longed to clear the whole lot out. I was
for leaving the place at once, and at last persuaded Bergholm to
consent. I had had quite enough of the jimbras, and the gold
prospect was nothing very promising.</p>

<p>We took a last look round the place before leaving, when
Bergholm got better, partly in hopes of having a shot at our
foes; but they kept well hidden. The bones of those in the
creek showed that a hideous feast had been enjoyed, and at the
tree-butts we saw the bones of many more crushed victims.</p>

<p>We managed to reach old Boodgin's camp, and camped there a
bit. I cut out a collar for him to wear out of a salmon tin, so
that he might be recognised as a friendly nigger by any whites
who came after us. We left the old fellow enough presents to make
him the millionaire of his tribe.</p>

<p>Whites may have found their way out since we were there, but
if so I fancy they must have missed seeing Boodgin and gone to
their fate. I forgot to say that I scrawled a message to any
whites that came that way, telling of the jimbras, and left it
with Boodgin to show them.</p>

<p>Our story received no credence, of course, when we returned
but Bergholm and I will carry the marks to our grave.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. &mdash; A SINGULAR HALLUCINATION</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 17 July 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
HE was indifferently well dressed, and always seemed to have a
handful of silver in his pocket when he paid for his drink; but
the strangest thing of all was in the way he took his drink. His
hand was perpetually shaking, to such an extent that sometimes
the attempt to get it to his lips was hopeless. This failure
would quite unnerve him, and he would go out, leaving it on the
bar counter. When he succeeded in getting it to his mouth he
bolted the fluid as though frightened it would he snatched from
him, then with a sigh of relief replaced the glass.</p>

<p>In company with a friend I generally visited the hotel he
frequented about the same hour that he put in an appearance, and
naturally our attention was attracted to this case of chronic
'jumps.' It is a singular fact in the problem of drink that a man
suffering badly from the effects of it can lift anything to his
mouth but a glass of spirits. Some unaccountable revulsion seems
to set in and relax the sinews, even to dropping the glass. My
friend and I put this down as a very bad case, and took some
notice of him, without making it remarkable. We put him down as a
professional failure of some sort, who had enough means left to
drink himself to death. He always wore a singularly high collar,
and often' a scarf around his neck. And he had a very suspicious
way of looking furtively round him, which was not at all genial.
He never spoke to anyone, and walked out as soon as he got his
liquor safely stowed away inside him.</p>

<p>It was some months after I first noticed him that I was
staying at a marine suburb of Brisbane. I was sitting on the
beach trying hard to think of nothing, when I noticed a familiar
figure approaching, and on its coming closer I recognised the
mysterious shaky stranger of the hotel. We had never spoken, but
meeting on this retired spot seemed a sufficient excuse for us to
exchange a nod of recognition, and he sat down beside me and
entered into a conversation on different topics. He was just as
shaky as ever, and his hand rattled the mouthpiece of his pipe
against his teeth when he put it into his mouth. At last he
gained confidence enough to tell me the following story:</p>

<p>'I am a surgeon by profession, and at one time was in fairly
good practice, which I lost under peculiar circumstances.
Fortunately, I have some independent means, so can live without
following it, which, now that I have lost my nerve, would be
impossible.</p>

<p>'I had a close friend, who married a pretty and clever woman,
but I was sorry to see that their married life was not a
particularly happy one, and that my friend, whose name was
Hastings, took to taking more than was good for him. At that
time, as my profession necessitated, I was a very temperate man,
with a trained nerve. Incompatibility of temper was, I suppose,
the original trouble; there was not the least suspicion of
infidelity on either side, but they were unfitted and unsuited
for mutual life. I am certainly not in favor of a law rendering
divorce too easy, but it seems a pity that two people who have
married under a mistake as to each other's dispositions should
not be able to rectify that mistake without committing some
social crime on a large scale. Well, Hastings took to tippling,
and his wife to scolding, and their future was a poor lookout. I
stuck to him, for he had been an exceedingly good fellow, and was
so still if he could be rescued from his surroundings, and much
the same could be said of her. With the right man she doubtless
would have made a model wife, but as it was, the latent evil in
both was developed by their marriage.</p>

<p>'One night Hastings called to see me, and I at once saw that
he had been on a long debauch, although, being a man of strong
physique, it made no great outward sign upon him. Mentally it was
quite different, and I entertained some doubts of his sanity, at
least upon one point. He wanted to know if I could perform a
surgical operation on his arms, so, that while he could still
write, and eat and drink, he yet could not use them with any
degree of strength; in fact, he wanted to know whether, by any
operation on the muscles or sinews, I could partly, paralyse him.
I treated the idea lightly, told him that it was an
impossibility, and attempted to turn the subject, but without
avail. He left me gloomy and discontented, and I hoped that it
was only the after effects of liquor, but still I felt very
uneasy. One would have thought that a separation by mutual
consent would have somewhat ended the unhappiness, but both had
now become morbid in their resentment of each other, and would
not seek peace for themselves, if that way would also give peace
to the other. So it kept on, and gradually I saw less of them,
for it was an unhappy home to visit, and a visitor only made
things worse.</p>

<p>'Hastings kept on drinking, and his temper gradually lost all
check, and from being a popular man with many friends he became
shunned and disliked. Months passed, and I had seen very little
of either for some time, when Mrs. Hastings came to consult me
professionally. She was greatly changed, both physically and
mentally I had put her husband down as verging on insanity, and I
did the same to her. The verdict I had to pronounce was one that
would have affrighted most women, but it seemed to give her a
sort of fiendish joy. She was suffering from what would end in a
painful death, though possibly a timely operation would prolong
her life. She had cancer of the breast, and I guessed the cause,
although she did not tell me in plain words Now I understand the
meaning of the mad suggestion he had made to me in the past. He
had struck her. This is what it had ended in after all; struck
her what would prove to be a murderous blow. And he had foreseen
it coming.</p>

<p>'"For every pang I suffer, he will suffer ten," she said as
she left.</p>

<p>'He did, too, and smothered it with drink.</p>

<p>'I did not perform the operation that was at last necessary,
but she died from it, and in the moments of consciousness that
preceded death she asked to be left alone with her husband. What
she said to him, how she cursed him, I never knew in exact words;
but from what I gathered afterwards, it was the most appalling
concentration of hatred that ever came from a dying woman's lips
addressed to the man who once had loved her, and had killed her
by an agonising death.</p>

<p>'The day after her burial a hasty messenger came clattering to
my door, and I went at once to see Hastings, who had cut his
throat.</p>

<p>'To say he had cut his throat is to put it mildly; rather, he
had attempted to cut it about a dozen times. Each time his
trembling and ineffectual hand had failed to inflict more than a
superficial wound, and though he had lost blood he had not
succeeded in making a dangerous wound, unless the state of his
blood brought on complications. Fortunately, the servant had come
straight to me, and the matter was hushed up without the police
knowing anything about it. I stitched him up and looked after him
myself until he was better, and somewhat restored to reason.</p>

<p>'I had a nice time whilst he was in delirium but especially
one night. Then he told me of his wife's dying moments, and how
she vowed she would, carry her prayers with her Into the next
world; his hands should be palsied and refuse to do their office;
and that the hand that struck her might never carry food or drink
to his mouth unless it was nerved by drink. Then he had told her
that he dreaded the madness that was growing on him, and had
begged me to, cripple his arms so that they would not obey him
and how I had refused to attempt it. Then she cursed me as well,
and upon my soul I was so worked upon by having to watch this
lunatic that I began to feel as frightened as he did.</p>

<p>'Well, I nursed Hastings back to life, and he took to drink
worse than ever. True enough his hand shook so that he could not
lift anything to his lips until he had drunk enough to steady his
nerves every morning. Then it came out to me. I found myself
nervous and queer one morning, and for the first time in my life
took some whisky for a pick-me-up. My hand shook so that I
hastily replaced the glass, for fear of dropping it. Again and
again I tried. The thing was so unusual that I could not believe
it. Then I suddenly recalled what Hastings had told me. I shook
worse than ever at the thought of such an improbable thing, but
it was true. When after some trouble I managed to get some spirit
swallowed.</p>

<p>'I never got over that. I sold my practice before I had to
give it up, for I foresaw the end, and that it would give me up
if I had to keep my nerve up with whisky continually.</p>

<p>'Hastings made many more attempts to cut his throat and always
failed, and was at last confined to an asylum. But I heard he was
released about a year ago. I suppose he'll succeed at last.'</p>

<p><br>
THE man arose, and without another word started; for home. I
rose and followed him.</p>

<p>He was still only just ahead of me when I turned into the
hotel I was staying at. I had a suspicion and asked a man I knew
who was standing on the verandah who my late acquaintance
was.</p>

<p>'That man,' said he. 'Oh, that's Hastings. Always tight; and
occasionally shut up for his own safety.</p>

<p>'Is he a doctor?'</p>

<p>'He was, I believe; but nobody would trust him now.'</p>

<p>'Did his wife die of cancer, and did he try to cut his
throat?'</p>

<p>'Never knew he had a wife, and certainly he couldn't cut his
throat if he tried, his hand's too shaky.'</p>

<p>'Well, he's a first-class novelist.'</p>

<p>But all the same, Mr. Hastings did successfully cut his throat
that very night; and at the inquest the medical evidence showed
that the throat of the deceased bore numerous old scars of former
attempts in the same direction.</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>21. &mdash; DOPPER'S LEGACY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 15 Aug 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Mowbrays of Pentavon Station were well known throughout
the district in which they resided the eldest family there.</p>

<p>Tom Mowbray, the grandfather of the present owner of the
station, had been amongst the first pioneers, and the venerable
gum-tree bearing his initials, rudely chopped out with a
tomahawk, was still reverently respected, though many a man with
an eye for timber had cast longing eyes on it.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the present owner and his father had had the
task of living down the evil reputation left behind by old Tom;
but they had inherited a good solid fortune to enable them to do
it, and thus had seen the descendants of their ancestor's
fellow-pioneers gradually pass forth from their lands, won from
the wilderness, leaving them in the possession of banks and
companies.</p>

<p>Old Tom Mowbray had been known as the hardest working and
hardest-hearted man of his day. Certainly, his pay was sure, but
it was extremely small, and if a blackfellow could do the work
for a small fee of tobacco and rations, no free white man need
expect the job. All manner of grisly tales were told about him,
more or less true, but it had been a matter of faith with his
descendants to glorify the old fellow's memory, and these legends
were only whispered.</p>

<p>Publicly, he was always spoken of in an after-dinner-speech
kind of manner as one of those gallant, dauntless pioneers who
had led the vanguard of civilisation into the wilderness, and
made Australia what it was, etc., <i>ad nauseam</i>.</p>

<p>There was, however, one tradition concerning this hero of the
old days that was currently and persistently believed in. That
was to the effect that one of his assigned servants of old Tom's
had a strange and secret influence over him. Tom Mowbray, it was
said, was in this man's power, and hated him accordingly. It was
not hinted at that Mowbray finally got rid of him by violence,
but certain it was that a stormy scene was overheard between the
two men; that Dopper (the assigned servant) was sent to the
magistrates for a severe flogging on a charge of assault and
insubordination, and narrowly escaped being sent back to the
chain gang.</p>

<p>Dopper took to the bush, and no man saw him again, although it
was said that his hand was visible on several daring robberies
that took place afterwards. Some six months after the
disappearance of Dopper the Pentavon homestead was broken into
during the absence of the family, and from that day old Tom was a
different man. What wrought the change no one knew, nor did he
ever tell; but he shrank from everybody, the sound of an
approaching horse tread made him start nervously, he grew thin
and haggard, and ever tote suspicious eyes seemed dreading the
approach of an enemy.</p>

<p>One evening he told his son that on the morrow he would tell
him something that it was necessary for him to know in the event
of anything happening to his father. The son saw nothing unusual
in his manner. The old man retired to the room he occupied alone,
but he did not appear at breakfast the next morning. His son,
then a man of 25, and virtually manager of the place, went to his
room and found him seated in his arm-chair with blood dripping
from his mouth, still alive and conscious, but nearly speechless.
In his hand a piece of paper was tightly grasped, and the feebly
beckoned to his son to stoop dawn. His voice seemed to bubble
through the blood that welled up in his throat and appeared to be
choking him; but all young Mowbray could make out from has
halting speech before death silenced it
was&mdash;'Keep&mdash;this, other&mdash;half. Give nothing
up&mdash;Swear, swear. Who shows&mdash;it.'</p>

<p>This unintelligible muttering was no further explained by any
subsequent discovery. No marks of violence were found; and the
paper, when taken from his stiffening band, was torn across, and
no trace could be found of the corresponding half, by which a key
to the meaning might have been found. The paper was settled and
crumpled, and appeared as though it had been torn during a
struggle. The fragment ran, in good, legible writing:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter" style="margin-right:45%; text-align:right">
at once make over<br>

night at my<br>

e when the<br>

d grindstone<br>

<span class="smcap">G. Eustace.</span></p>

<p><br>
THE strictest search did not reveal the absent piece, and no
efforts at supplying the words furnished any clue. The only thing
that made it of any importance were the broken words he had
muttered. The paper in appearance had been torn for some time,
months perhaps. Other papers were strewn around, as though the
old man had been going through them, preparatory to the
disclosure he was to have made to his son in the morning. Death
had been occasioned, in all probability, by some mental shock,
and old Tom Mowbray went to sleep for ever under the soil he had
won with his own hand.</p>

<p>Nothing happened during the reign of Oscar Mowbray, and his
son Sidney inherited the family mystery with the broad lands of
the station. Sidney was unmarried and about 27 years of age when
the mystery of the torn letter was at last solved.</p>

<p>Naturally, the district was considerably altered since old
Tom's day. A town had, sprung up not ten miles away, and a
railway joined it with the metropolis. The old homestead had
given place to a modern building, surrounded with lawn, orchard,
and garden, and many a square mile off freehold called Mowbray
owner.</p>

<p>One day stranger called to see Sidney. He presented a letter
from a well-known firm of solicitors, which said that the bearer,
Roderick Eustace, had important business with Mr. Mowbray which
it would be well to look into. The name did not at first strike
Sidney, as the affair of the torn letter had almost faded from
his memory; but it was quickly renewed in the course of the
conversation which ensued.</p>

<p>The visitor was a good-looking young fellow somewhere about
Mowbray's own age; self possessed, well-mannered, with something
of the air of a sailor about him.</p>

<p>'I may as well come to the object of my visit at once, Mr.
Mowbray. I presume you are satisfied by that letter that I have
the right to ask the question I am about to. Have you a torn
letter in your possession which was found in your grandfather's
hand at the time of his death?'</p>

<p>In an instant the story told him by his father, and the name
of Eustace, flashed through Mowbray's mind.</p>

<p>'I still have the letter,' he said in reply. 'I presume from
the similarity of names that you know something about it?'</p>

<p>'I did not until the other day, but I think I can find the
missing part if you allow me to copy it.'</p>

<p>Mowbray hesitated, and referred to the stranger's
credentials.</p>

<p>'I scarcely know,' he returned at last, 'how to answer you.
Your name and the letter you have brought me assure me somewhat
that you do not ask out of idle curiosity. You have a
motive?'</p>

<p>'A motive that may greatly affect my future.'</p>

<p>'Wait for me,' said Mowbray.</p>

<p>Left alone, the stranger went to the French light and stepping
on the verandah, gazed over the beautiful scene of peace and
plenty that smiled under the brilliant sun.</p>

<p>'A good place to own,' he muttered, 'and confounded hard lines
to have to part with it.'</p>

<p>Mowbray returned with a cash-box, which he unlocked, and
taking out the fragment, read it over carefully; then handed it
to the stranger. He in his turn read it somewhat eagerly, then
gave it back to the owner.</p>

<p>'It is what I seek,' he said. 'Can I copy it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, on condition that you inform me what is the results of
your investigation. They may be of interest to me.'</p>

<p>'Doubtless; and be sure, Mr. Mowbray, that you shall hear from
me when I have compared it with the other half.'</p>

<p>Mowbray invited his visitor to stay for dinner and sleep there
the night, but after a short hesitation Eustace excused himself,
and after copying the letter, took his departure.</p>

<p>On arrival at the township he went to the principal hotel,
and entering a private sitting room, was greeted by a young and
handsome girl, sufficiently like him to indicate the relationship
of brother and sister.</p>

<p>'Have you got it?' she eagerly asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, a copy of it. Where is the other piece?'</p>

<p>She left the room and presently returned the corresponding
portion. For half an hour they pored over the papers, making
notes as they proceeded. On the conclusion of their investigation
they looked at each other questioningly.</p>

<p>'I think it will be easy to find the place,' said the man at
last.</p>

<p>'What sort of person is this Mr. Mowbray?' asked his
sister.</p>

<p>'I took a liking to him. He appears to be perfectly
straightforward and bears a good reputation about here. A fine,
manly sort of fellow.'</p>

<p>The girl mused. 'I should like to see the place,' she said,
'We can easily take a drive through and see it. He wanted me to
stay to dinner and sleep there, but I couldn't, of course, do
that.'</p>

<p>A few weeks elapsed before Mowbray heard anything more of, or
from, his late visitor, Then he received a letter from the same
firm of solicitors notifying that they had a communication of
importance for him, and begging his attendance in Sydney.</p>

<p>Mowbray proceeded at once, and learned from the lawyers that
they were acting on behalf of Mr. Victor Eustace, who claimed the
whole of the property as legitimate heir of his grandfather,
Thomas Mowbray. But they thought matters could be arranged, Mr.
Eustace being willing to treat amicably. Mowbray thought he must
be the sport of a dream, and repudiated the whole thing as an
imposture. Did they infer that his grandfather had never been
married to his grandmother?</p>

<p>Not at all; but he had a wife living at the time, was the
answer.</p>

<p>A meeting was arranged for the next morning, and Mowbray,
after a sleepless night, met Eustace and his sister in the
presence of one of the legal firm.</p>

<p>'Mr. Mowbray,' said Eustace, 'you were open enough with me,
and I shall be glad indeed if we can settle this matter on a
mutually, satisfactory basis. First and foremost, I will give you
a copy of the complete letter. Here it is.'</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">You will at once make over the station and all
your property to me on peril of being exposed and turned out by
me or any descendants. I have regained the proofs, and have
bestowed them safely where you will never find them. If you like
to manage things quietly, meet me to-night at my old hut. I will
be there when the shadow touches the old grindstone tree.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">G. Eustace.</span></p>

<br>

<p>Mowbray looked at the other with an astonished smile.</p>

<p>'Is this the substance of your claim to all I possess?' he
added somewhat superciliously. Eustace drew forth another piece
of paper with oblong holes cut in it.</p>

<p>'This is the key,' he said; 'and when you have used it I have
a story to tell you.'</p>

<p>Following directions, Mowbray placed, the paper with the holes
over the letter, and copied the words visible through them. They
came out thus:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Station and property, the proof find at my old hut when
the shadow touches the old grindstone tree.</p>

<br>

<p>'I suppose you know the little knoll still called 'Dopper's
Hut?'</p>

<p>'Of course I do.'</p>

<p>'That is the place meant. Dopper, as he was called, was your
grand-father's brother-in-law; his sister my grandmother.'</p>

<p>'I presume that owing to my allowing you to copy the half of
the paper found in my grandfather's hand you got the clue to the
hiding-place of these so-called proofs, and obtained them?'</p>

<p>'Quite so. The important words "my" and "grindstone" gave the
locality. Now, if you like I will tell you some family
history.'</p>

<p>Eustace spoke lightly, as though winning or losing a
magnificent property were an every day occurrence; but his hearer
felt by no means so comfortable as he proceeded.</p>

<p>'Mowbray,' commenced Eustace, 'I scarcely think that either
you or I have much cause to be proud of our mutual ancestor
Thomas Mowbray. He was a bigamist and a murderer.'</p>

<p>Mowbray started up in rage.</p>

<p>'Keep quiet; be was my grandfather as well as yours, and I am
by no means proud of the fact.'</p>

<p>'He left a good property, however, which you seemingly hanker
after.'</p>

<p>'And which you and your fattier have illegally enjoyed; but we
shall gain nothing by sparring at each other&mdash;suffer me to
tell my tale. Thomas Mowbray and my great-uncle, George Eustace,
or Dopper, were great friends. Their station in life was
equal&mdash;that is to say, that they were both as poor as rats.
My grandmother had some money left her by an aunt, on which she
was able to live and sometimes assist her brother. Mowbray
married her. Things did not improve, and both my grandfather and
grand-uncle got into bad company and bad ways. Without mincing
matters, they became criminals. They were surprised one night
when they had forcibly entered one of the old-fashioned county
banks common in those days. Mowbray escaped with some of the
plunder. Eustace was taken. There had been a scuffle, and such
things were then hanging matters. How Eustace escaped the gallows
I know not. Mowbray always assured him that it was through a
judicious expenditure of the portion of the stolen money saved by
him. This was a lie, and with the same falsehood he persuaded his
wife to advance her little capital for the defence of her
brother. Eustace was transported. Mowbray, with the two stolen
sums of money&mdash;for his wife's had been obtained under false
pretences&mdash;sailed secretly for Australia,
leaving&mdash;amiable man that he was&mdash;his wife and infant
daughter to live or die as Providence determined. A free man with
some ready cash, he soon got on, and, having decided to cut the
painter for good, married again, and became a responsible and
highly respected member of the community.</p>

<p>'After his bigamous marriage, we may presume that he grew
cautious, and thenceforth acted with passable honesty. Meantime
his old friend and scapegoat had suffered all the penalties of
those days, until, as some kind of tardy acknowledgment, Mowbray
got him assigned to him, and he lived a tolerably easy life on
the station.</p>

<p>'It was a strange position. Mowbray was frightened of
Dopper&mdash;the alias my great-uncle went under&mdash;and Dopper
was anxious to preserve the semi-state of freedom he enjoyed. He
recognised the fact that if it came to open war he, as a convict,
would probably get the worst of it. However, he bided his time.
He managed, after many years, to get a letter conveyed to
England, in which he asked his sister to forward him copies of
all papers necessary to prove her legal standing as Mowbray's
wife. He did not know if she was living or dead when he addressed
the letter to the old village, where she was well known; but,
after some time, she received it.</p>

<p>'She was old. She had gone through trouble, poverty, and slow
starvation. Her daughter had married a good man&mdash;a distant
cousin of the same name, "Eustace"&mdash;our father. He was a
kindly-hearted man, and cared for his wife's mother. She was
comfortable, and at peace. Still, as her brother hinted that the
possession of these copies might alleviate his position, she sent
them. For herself, she did not seek to rake up the unhappy past
and bring shame on the innocent children.'</p>

<p>Eustace paused, and Mowbray remarked,</p>

<p>'That argument does not appear to influence you.'</p>

<p>'To a certain extent it does, as I will presently explain.
However, through some mischance the packet fell into my
grandfather's hands. There was a violent scene, and Mowbray sent
his servant and ex-friend to the flogger. Dopper took to the
bush, and Mowbray never knew peace again. Then Dopper broke into
the station homestead, regained the documents, which Mowbray had
with one of those unaccountable oversights not destroyed. And
that act sealed the fate of both men.</p>

<p>'That letter&mdash;the pieces of which we have just put
together&mdash;was written, of course, by Dopper to my
grandfather, and the appointment was kept. When the shadow of the
hut touched the old grindstone-tree the two men met, and,
according to the only witness, who dared not give
evidence&mdash;for his own neck was forfeit&mdash;the mutual and
long-nursed hatred broke forth at once.</p>

<p>'Mowbray defied the convict, and holding the letter in his
clenched hand shook his fist in the other's face, and swore that
he would drag him single-handed to the gallows. A fierce struggle
ensued, in which the letter was torn. The watcher, who was
Dopper's companion, and also an outlaw, was hastening to the
rescue, when Dopper fell, stabbed; and Mowbray hearing the
advancing footsteps, fled for his life. Dopper was dying: He had
just time to give some directions to his mate, and that was all.
His body was buried by the other man; and six months afterwards
old Mowbray followed him, dying, as his mate did, with the blood
bubbling from between his lips and the corresponding half of the
torn letter in his stiffening grasp.</p>

<p>'Dopper's mate&mdash;a fallen gentleman&mdash;was able to
carry out his last instructions, after much difficulty and
trouble. The torn half of the letter, the key, and some other
papers, eventually found their way into my mother's hands,
together with a statement of the scene that occurred at Dopper's
death, which, of course, has no legal value.</p>

<p>'What freak made Dopper include the secret of the hiding-place
of the papers in the letter addressed to my grandfather I cannot
say. Probably for the same reason he appointed the meeting at the
very place where they were buried. Doubtless he intended to leave
more definite, instructions had not death cut him short. Mowbray
evidently guessed that the claimant would possess the torn half
of the letter.</p>

<p>'My father would take no action in the matter. He had no wish
to open up such an evil scandal; and my mother agreed with
him.'</p>

<p>'You intend, then, to prosecute what you consider your
rightful claim?'</p>

<p>'That depends upon you. I have no wish to be exacting; and I
probably would have let it pass as my father did but that I have
had severe losses, and I am anxious to restore to my sister her
portion of my father's fortune which has been lost. For myself, I
have my profession of the sea.'</p>

<p>'But these proofs are mere copies, of no value by your own
showing.'</p>

<p>'Quite true; but they saved me all trouble in hunting up the
original entries. Dopper's hut stands no longer; but the old tree
to which the grindstone was affixed is still there, and I had not
much difficulty in locating the hut, as one of the corner-posts
is still in existence.'</p>

<p>'But why this affected mystery about the shadow? Why not have
said at the foot of the grindstone tree?'</p>

<p>'A bit of superfluous cunning. I was bothered at first, then I
guessed that it should have read, 'The old grindstone tree's,'
meaning the tree's shadow. This would bring it to the opposite
side of the tree. I searched there and found an old gun barrel,
plugged at one end. In it were the papers.'</p>

<p>'Can I see you to-morrow at the same hour?' said Mowbray
abruptly, getting up. 'I have much to think over.'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' returned Eustace, 'believe me an amicable
adjustment will he better for us both.'</p>

<p>Mowbray had indeed much to think of. True, he himself did not
bear the stain of illegitimacy, even if Eustace's story was true,
but he had been brought up with a due appreciation of his own
importance, and the blow to his pride was terrible. Then, too,
the somewhat cavalier manner of the sailor irritated him. Always
accustomed to hear his grandfather spoken of with respect, to
hear him referred to as a criminal of the lowest type, guilty of
nearly every crime in the calendar, was not exactly pleasant.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the bright and beautiful face of Miss Eustace
came between him and his gloomy thoughts, and when it did he felt
his burden somewhat lighter. There seemed only the slightest
chance for him to fight the claim successfully, and that was the
contention that the Mowbray of Eustace's story was not identical
with Mowbray of Pentavon Station, but he felt that this was but a
slender reed to lean upon.</p>

<p>The next morning brought the appointed meeting.</p>

<p>'Mr. Eustace,' he said, taking the initiative; 'I will to-day
place the case in the hands of my solicitors, and get their
opinion. I have no doubt they will advise me to fight, but I do
not say that I shall follow that advice, although my purse being
longer than yours, I should probably tire you out. If you can
convince me that you are in a position to prove the identity of
the Mowbray you claim as grandfather, and the one I have
inherited the property from, and your other proofs are
forthcoming, and found to be genuine, I shall not contest your
claim.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear it. We can let sleeping dogs lie. Your name
is Mowbray, mine is Eustace. All I shall take will be enough to
restore the fortune my sister and myself have lost through an
unlucky venture. The station&mdash;and landed property can remain
yours.'</p>

<p>'I shall take nothing. It is all yours, or all mine.'</p>

<p>As Mowbray spoke he caught Miss Eustace looking at him with
admiration plainly expressed on her face.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Mr. Mowbray, but that is outright nonsense. I only
want what I have said; your action would make all public and the
unsavory reputation of our common grandfather be trailed in the
mud.'</p>

<p>Mowbray winced, but answered firmly, 'I know that, but once I
believe in the justice of your claim, believe me that will be no
obstacle.'</p>

<p>'It will take time to adjust things,' said the sailor, 'and
during the delay I hope that my sister and I may induce you to
change, your mind.'</p>

<p>Mowbray rose, and the girl frankly held out her hand to him
and gave him a hearty pressure.</p>

<p>'I trust with my brother that we may get you to think
differently, but I honestly confess that in your place I should
feel as you do. And I believe my brother thinks the same.'</p>

<p>Eustace laughed. 'Jessie, you are romantic,' he said,</p>

<p><br>
'I WISH it had been a different sort of man we had to deal
with,' she said, after Mowbray had left.</p>

<p>'So do I, but we must persuade him out of it somehow.'</p>

<p>Time passed and the friendship between the strangely matched
opponents grew deeper; but Mowbray showed no sign of changing his
determination. Not even the passion springing up in his breast
for his supplanter's sister could induce him to listen to
argument. It was all his, or none of it, was the stand he
took.</p>

<p>Jessie Eustace saw nothing but complications ahead; she felt
that a mutual affection was ripening between them, but that
Mowbray would never speak, never accept the easy way out of the
difficulty, if the lawyers advised compromise. She began to wish
their claim might turn out valueless.</p>

<p>At last the case was complete. Mowbray's solicitors advised
him to agree to a compromise, as his only chance was to weary his
opponent out by successive and expensive appeals.</p>

<p>Mowbray came to see the brother and sister that night. It was
a chilly night, and they were seated near the fire discussing the
vexed question. Mowbray still being resolved to change the
subject, he asked to see the musket barrel in which the papers
had been concealed.</p>

<p>Eustace produced it. The top of the barrel had been sawn off
to admit of inspecting the inside.</p>

<p>'How did you guess the papers were inside?' asked Mowbray.</p>

<p>'The plug being so firmly jammed in I was led to think that
the barrel must have been used for security and concealment.'</p>

<p>'An old Tower musket, by the look of it, big nipple, stopped
up as well.'</p>

<p>He handed it back to Eustace, seated in front of the fire, who
began to reiterate his arguments as to an equal division of the
estate. As he spoke he carelessly tapped the top bar of the grate
with the butt end of the barrel.</p>

<p>'Don't do that,' exclaimed Mowbray, 'you never
know&mdash;'</p>

<p>His words were interrupted by a loud explosion, and the sailor
fell from his chair with a ball through his breast. The gun
barrel had been loaded, the cap had rotted off, but the
fulminating powder still remained in the nipple, and the idle
tapping had exploded it. Dopper's legacy!</p>

<p><br>
WHAT ARGUMENT could not effect, Mowbray consented to do to
ease the death bed of his new found cousin, the bright young
sailor for whom life was just opening, with a rosy future in
view.</p>

<p>Whether it was inadventure, or Dopper had purposely loaded the
musket in case that if Mowbray found the plant he might
accidentally get the benefit of the charge, no one could say. But
it did its work too well. It need scarcely be written that the
property was finally united by the marriage of Mowbray and Jessie
Eustace, and the memory of the victim to the inheritance was
always kept green.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. &mdash; THE INVISIBLE HORSEMAN</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 7 March 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THE moon was full and about half-way to the zenith, and the
tall trees on either hand threw black shadows across the bridle
track I was riding alone. The shadows were abrupt and strongly
marked. Presently I heard the sound of a horse's footfall
following me, and glanced round to see who it was who was
overtaking me. To my surprise, I could see no one, although the
footfall had sounded quite close, and appeared to be travelling
swiftly. Twice this occurred, and I began to fancy that I was
encouraging a hallucination, when the station lights came in
sight, and I rode gladly on, for a nasty superstitious feeling
was beginning to creep over me.</p>

<p>The station was owned by a widow&mdash;doubly
bereaved&mdash;for six months after the death of her husband her
only son, a promising young fellow of about 18 or 19, was killed
by his house falling on him only three miles from the station. I
was living on a neighboring station, so rode up to the bachelors'
quarters as a matter of course, and unsaddled and turned my horse
out. A hearty welcome, a nip of Mackay, and a rough but plentiful
feed, soon drove all thoughts of the supernatural out of my
brain. I told the boys, however, what queer fancies had come into
my head on the road, and I was astonished to see that they took
it gravely said&mdash;</p>

<p>'That sound has been heard before,' said Doyle, the oldest r
man there. 'It was on just such a moonlight night as this that
young Murdoch was killed, and at the very place where you heard
the footfall. He was cantering along, with the Mack boy riding
behind, when his horse tripped and rolled right over on top of
him. Killed him instantly.'</p>

<p>'And is it only on moonlight nights like this that he
walks?'</p>

<p>'So they say; but that is not all the yarn. It was on that
same night that Mis.. Murdoch&mdash;you know what a severe woman
she is&mdash;found out that pretty little Maggie, the girl she
brought up with her as half-servant, half-companion, was likely
to become a mother. She got in a terrible state, and when Maggie,
in her shame and terror, confessed that young Murdoch was the
man, she nearly went mad. Late as it was, she had the horses put
in the buggy, and told me to drive Maggie over to the
township&mdash;she would not have her on the place another night.
I protested, but it was useless, and when we got about three
miles away, for that bridle track is a short cut on to the road,
there was the dead body of the man who had sworn to marry her and
save her good name, lying in the moonlight on the dusty
track.</p>

<p>'I don't want to go through that scene over again, I can
assure you. The black boy had ridden in and raised an alarm, and
some men came out to bring the body in. I managed to quieten the
girl somewhat and pushed on to the township; but next morning she
was in a raging fever, and what with that and having a dead child
born prematurely, poor Maggie nearly died too. She recovered,
however, and went away somewhere&mdash;nobody knew where. Ever
since the clatter of a horse can be heard coming along that
bridle track on moonlight nights. I don't know whether Mrs.
Murdoch has heard of it or not, but I expect she has.'</p>

<p><br>
MRS. MURDOCH soon left the station which had such bitter
memories for her. Doyle and the other fellows had wandered off
one by one, until at last there were none of the old hands left.
The superintendent had occasion to hire a married couple, and
procured one in the neighbouring township. The man was a surly
ill-conditioned lout, whilst the woman was neat and tidy, with
the remains of past prettiness on her sad and worn face; they
were without children.</p>

<p>They had not been there long before it was found out that he
was in the habit of beating his wife, and being tackled by one of
the other men about it, he showed up a cur. But this did not help
the poor woman, who probably received extra punishment on the
quiet in consequence of the man's interference. The story of the
ghostly footfall had of course been handed down, and it was
noticed that often of a moonlight night the poor silent woman
would steal out and walk along the ghost's pad, as it was
called.</p>

<p>One night, when it was almost as clear as day, one of the men,
smoking in the verandah of the men's hut, saw the woman steal out
along the ghost's pad. Shortly afterwards he noticed the husband
slink after her, and, fearing he meant mischief, the man who was
the same one who had interfered before, went after him. The woman
was standing looking expectantly along the road, when her husband
went up to her, and, putting his hand on her shoulder, told her
roughly to go home. She shrank away from, him and he lifted his
fist. At that moment the watcher heard the approach of the
invisible horse and rider. Whether the woman really saw anything
or not it was not possible to tell; but she lifted her hands up
and her face was transformed with joy. As for the husband he gave
one glance in that direction, then took to his heels and ran
home.</p>

<p>After that the woman, was free to wander out to the ghost's
pad whenever she liked, but it did not alter her husband's
behavior to her when on the station. It was about 12 o'clock one
night when the whole homestead was awakened by a shriek of mortal
terror. It came from the room off the kitchen where the couple
slept. Hastening there they found the woman with her face bruised
and bleeding from a blow, standing half-dressed in the middle of
the room and the man extended on the floor senseless.</p>

<p>The tale told by the woman was that her husband had quarrelled
with and struck her. That then something, she knew not what, had
come between them, and her husband had fallen to the floor,
uttering the cry they had heard.</p>

<p>When the man came to his senses he could tell nothing,
excepting that he admitted having struck his wife and being
immediately felled by what, he said, was a red hot fist. Strange
to say, there was now visible a distinct burn on his temple where
he said he had been struck. The story was very strange. The poor
woman had not the strength to strike such a blow, and the man
could not have inflicted it himself. The mystery was never
solved, but the man became different after that; less violent,
but more taciturn and sullen. Some months after that a distant
shot heard in the middle of the night roused one or two sleepers
whose rest was light, but nobody took the trouble to rise and
investigate the matter. In the morning the husband waited on the
super, and told him that he had accidentally shot his wife
during the night.</p>

<p>His story ran that he had followed his wife, suspecting that
these visits of hers to the ghost's pad were only a screen for
covering an illicit love affair. He saw his wife seated on a log
beside a young man or boy, who had his arm round her waist. That
he took aim and fired at this man, and that the bullet passed
through the man and struck his wife.</p>

<p>The body of the one-time pretty Maggie was found at the place
he described, and buried by the side of young Murdoch. And from
that date the tramp of the ghostly horse was heard no more. The
author of her death persisted in his story up to the minute that
the bolt was drawn and he dropped into eternity. He avowed that
the youth embracing his wife was no being of this earth, for the
charge had no effect on him at all. And the doctor who had
examined the corpse of the murdered woman told a strange story
that few could believe.</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>23. &mdash; AT FEVER CAMP</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 26 Oct 1901</h3>

<p class="first">
FEVER Camp was the bank of a swollen flooded river, and all
around the country was a quagmire that, in the slang of the bush,
would 'bog a duck.'</p>

<p>There were three men in the Fever Camp and all three of them
were suffering more or less, mostly, more, from the malarial
fever that haunted the bush in the earlier days of North
Queensland settlement. They had finished all the quinine, and
there was no possibility of getting any more until there was a
break in the weather. Occasionally one of the three had a good
day, that is, a day when he did not feel so much like a frozen,
toasted scarecrow as usual, and then that lucky man got up and
cooked some food.</p>

<p>At other times their only recreation, apart from groaning, was
retailing their symptoms to one another. One man had a full
advantage over the others, which he did not hesitate to meanly
take advantage of. He had had the fever on the West Coast of
Africa, and he insisted on retailing the symptoms he had
experienced there, in addition to what he then felt.</p>

<p>Reynolds, one of the men, had a good, day, and he was standing
before the fire under the shelter they had built over it,
encouraging the fire to burn by the application of some twigs. He
had a blanket round his shoulders, and was debating in his own
mind whether he felt, cold or hot. The fire at last ceased
smoking sulkily, and commenced to blaze. Reynolds gave a sigh of
relief and stepped outside, as it had ceased raining for a
wonder.</p>

<p>Looking up at the sky, he caught sight of a patch of blue,
across which the clouds were scudding at a tremendous rate. The
clouds, too, were higher, and the surrounding haze had
disappeared&mdash;a change had taken place.</p>

<p>'Come out, you fellows,' he said; 'it's going to break up at
last.'</p>

<p>One after another two hollow-eyed skeletons crawled out of the
tent, and gazed around with heavy eyes; at the same moment the
sun, looking a little watery, and the worse for wear, peeped out,
and blinked at them. If they had not been so weak they would have
given it a cheer.</p>

<p>Said Carthew, the man who had been on the West Coast of
Africa, 'I wonder where the horses are? Who heard the bells
last?'</p>

<p>'I did, last night,' replied Reynolds. 'They're up the river.
I expect they'll stick there; the banks are sandy, and sounder
than the other country.'</p>

<p>'Really, I feel as though I could eat something,' said
Maxwell, the third man, 'anything cooked?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' returned Reynolds, 'I was just going 'to put the billy
on.'</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour the three men were making a fairly
successful attempt at a meal, the first they had taken together
for many days. The sun made gallant attempts to shine, and the
hurrying clouds were fast taking on a denser and more solid
appearance, as though they had bottled up the residue of their
watery contents for another opportunity. As evening drew on there
shone forth a fiery red sunset, and Reynolds, looking out of the
tent some hours after dark, announced a clear starlit sky.</p>

<p><br>
NEXT MORNING was clear, bright, and beautiful, and but for the
muddy river flowing along a tanker, and the sheets of water
standing on the level country, no one would have thought that it
had been raining and storming for the last week. Reynolds and
Carthew both felt better, but Maxwell was still very low.
Reynolds said he would go a little way up the river and see if he
could see anything of the horses, so sauntered away soon after
breakfast.</p>

<p>After a mile or two, he began to feel languid, and sat dawn on
a log to rest. The sub was growing hot, the moist ground getting
steamy, and he had overrated his strength. He sat idly upon the
log watching the water flowing past, and wondering stupidly at
the debris that glided like a constantly-moving panorama before
him.</p>

<p>Presently a strange object, amidst the flotsam of the flooded
river, fixed his attention, and he aroused himself from his
half-stupor, and earnestly regarded it. It was the body of a man.
Thoroughly aroused, he hurried down to the edge of the water, the
better to see it. He was too weak to go into the water after it;
if the current took him off his legs he would be drowned, he felt
sure. A swirl of the stream sent the ghastly object nearly within
his reach, and in his eagerness to reach it he got into deep
water. Choking and struggling, he fought his way desperately back
to the bank, and pulled himself out, trembling and panting.</p>

<p>'That was a near go.' he said. 'Why, I've no more strength
than a sick cat' He looked around for the body; it had floated
past, but down below there was a projecting point, and above this
there was a by-wash, and towards this haven of refuge the corpse
was steering.</p>

<p>When, still weak and trembling, Reynolds reached the point, he
found the object in still water, awaiting him. With the help of a
long stick he guided it to where the bank sloped gradually, and
after much trouble got it ashore.</p>

<p>The body must have been in the water some three days, and was
the corpse of a tall, middle-aged man, with a big, fair beard.
While Reynolds was regarding it, the horse bells suddenly rang
out on the bank above him, and going up to the top be found the
horses he was in search of camped in a patch of scrub, and he was
not long driving them back to the camp. There he told his tale,
and Carthew caught a horse, and they went back together; Maxwell
being too ill to leave the camp.</p>

<p>The two men, by the utmost exertion of what poor strength the
fever had left them, got the body on to the top of the bank, to a
place where they could bury it.</p>

<p>The man was dressed in the usual bush rig; his clothes and
boots were good, and he had a good watch in his watch pouch. It
had stopped at 4 o'clock. In his other pouch there was a pipe,
knife, and tobacco, and he had a revolver pouch on, but there was
no revolver in it. On his temple there was an ugly bruise, which,
from the discoloration, must have been made some time before
death.</p>

<p>They had finished their examination, and had taken off the
man's belt, with the pouch on, when Carthew drew attention, to
the tightly-clenched hands of the deceased, and they opened the
sodden fingers. In one hand were same twigs and sticks, in the
other a crumpled and soaked letter.</p>

<p>Carthew spread it out gingerly and carefully in the sun.</p>

<p>'When it dries we may make something out of it, but I am
afraid it has been in the water too long.'</p>

<p>They had laid the body out as decently as possible, and were
about to return to the camp on get tools to dig a grave, when
Reynolds suddenly clutched Carthew's arm.</p>

<p>'Isn't he like Maxwell?' he said. 'By Jove, the likeness is
wonderful. Perhaps it's only the beard. Better not say anything
to him while he's ill&mdash;it might be a relation.'</p>

<p>Reynolds nodded, and they went back to the camp; Carthew
taking the half-dried letter with him. They had a meal, and
discussed the probabilities of the man's habitation.</p>

<p>'There's a crossing twenty miles tip,' said Reynolds. 'He
might be a traveller who tried to swim across, and got kicked by
his horse.'</p>

<p>'What had he got the letter in his hand for? A traveller
wouldn't do that. Any stations up the river?'</p>

<p>'Yes, two, on opposite sides of the river&mdash;one ten miles
above the crossing and one fifteen. Above the top one the range
comes in,' replied Reynolds.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Carthew, 'it's not a pleasant job, but we must
bury the poor fellow, and get it over. I can spare a blanket to
sew him up in.'</p>

<p>'Sorry I can't give you a hand,' said Maxwell, 'but I haven't
the strength of a staggering bob.'</p>

<p>'We can manage, old man; it would only upset you.' And the two
men went down to the river again.</p>

<p>They could not bury the poor wretch very deep, they were too
fagged out, but they piled logs above, the shallow grave to keep
it from desecration by the wild dogs; then utterly wearied out
they returned to camp.</p>

<p><br>
IT was nearly a week before the three men could leave the
fever camp and travel slowly up the river to the crossing. During
the time they had been detained Carthew had made an attempt to
decipher the letter. It was in a woman's hand, and, as far as he
could make out an invitation to someone to come and see her, for
somebody else would be absent. The names were a smear, and, the
whole thing a puzzle, too; it bore the appearance of a guilty
assignation.</p>

<p>The crossing consisted of an embryo township of two pubs, a
blacksmith's shop, and a habitation for a police trooper. Under
the bright sunshine, down the fast-drying road, a young man rode
the morning after the three travellers had arrived. He was such a
good-natured, fresh, and innocent-looking young fellow that it
was no wonder he was popular in the district. He dismounted at
the best of the two pubs.</p>

<p>'Good morning Mr. Goring,' said the landlord. 'Maxwell's body
has been found.'</p>

<p>'Impossible,' said Goring, with a start 'Where was it
found?'</p>

<p>'Floating down the river. Some travellers, who were camped
down the river, found it, and buried it. One of them is going
back now with Walters, the trooper, to identify and examine it.
They say there was a nasty bruise on the forehead.'</p>

<p>Goring drank his whisky slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>'I must go with them,' he said, 'I am a J.P., and was his
friend and neighbor.'</p>

<p>Once more the unhappy corpse that bad been the sport and
plaything of the flooded river was brought into the glaring light
of day, and fully identified as William Maxwell, the manager of
Bovis Downs, the station ten miles above the crossing. Carthew,
for half a dozen good reasons, had not mentioned the letter.</p>

<p>Goring was visibly affected at the sight of his old friend and
neighbor, and expressed his relief when the body was decently
re-interred in a deeper grave. Carthew made some excuse to ride
ahead the following morning, for the distance had compelled the
party to camp at the fever camp that night. He went straight up
to the room where Maxwell was in bed.</p>

<p>'Can you manage to get up, old man?'</p>

<p>'I'll try, what for?'</p>

<p>'I want you to come in to the bar directly, when I give a
signal. It's only an experiment. I'll tell you all about it
presently.'</p>

<p>Maxwell languidly got up and dressed himself, and Carthew
returned to the bar. The others had returned, and were in the bar
drinking.</p>

<p>Goring was talkative, and excited. He was leaning hack against
the counter talking to Walters and Carthew, when suddenly his
face turned livid, and he put out his hand in a trembling manner
and gave a frightened shriek.</p>

<p>'By God, earth and water won't hold him! It was an accident, I
swear. He struck at me first. Keep him from me, men!'</p>

<p>And he slipped down in a convulsive fit, overcome by a
terrible shock.</p>

<p>Maxwell, gaunt and hollow-eyed, looking the very image of the
corpse, had entered the bar at the signal from Carthew.</p>

<p>When Goring came to himself, Walters arrested him for the
murder of William Maxwell, but his nerve were shaken, and he made
a full confession, which saved his life.</p>

<p>Young, foolish, and of a boastful nature, he had drifted into
an intrigue with Maxwell's wife. On the day of Maxwell's death
she bad sent a letter across the flooded river by a native,
telling him that Maxwell would be away at the crossing that
night. Whether Maxwell suspected them or not was never known, but
instead of going to the crossing Maxwell rode down the opposite
side of the river soon after the letter, and hailed for the
boat.</p>

<p>Goring, who was preparing to leave, went over himself with the
boat. Maxwell seemed friendly enough, and said he wanted to see
him on business, so he entered the boat, and they started back,
Maxwell pulling.</p>

<p>Now, out of boyish bravado and vanity, what must Goring do but
take out Mrs. Maxwell's letter and commence to read it before her
husband's face. Of course he did not expect that Maxwell would
recognise the handwriting at the distance they were apart, but
the situation appealed to his youthful conceit. Maxwell did
recognise the writing, and in an instant the letter was snatched
from Goring's hand, and he started up to find himself, confronted
by a stronger man than, himself, in a furious rage.</p>

<p>Goring had a loaded thong in his hand, and in blind terror he
struck at Maxwell and hit him in the temple. Maxwell reeled and
fell overboard, nearly capsizing the boat, and when Goring
recovered his wits he was no longer in sight.</p>

<p>Caught by snags, and detained in eddies, sheltered at times in
quiet back waters, and at times exposed to the full force of the
riotous flood, the corpse, still clutching the damning letter,
had drifted down to near the fever camp, until Reynolds had seen
and rescued It. Carthew's suspicions had been aroused by the
letter. Blurred and blotched as it was, he had made out enough to
show him its purport, and he naturally arrived at the conclusion
that a woman would not make such an appointment with her own
husband. The name was too smeared to decipher, but there was only
one man, and that man was Goring.</p>

<p>The two Maxwells were cousins, but were not aware of each
other's whereabouts. The guilty man's story was believed, and he
got off lightly, but as when once more a free man Mrs. Maxwell
found him out, and never left him alone afterwards, perhaps the
scaffold would have been the most merciful punishment of the
two.</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>24. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE GORGE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 4, 11 Feb 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE sombre shadow of the gorge we were riding through rather
weighed upon our spirits. It may have been that, or perhaps the
uncanny echo that waited on every word we uttered was the reason
that we did not speak to each other.</p>

<p>It was in the Macdonnell Ranges, and we were following a gorge
that seemed likely to lead us in the direction we wanted to go.
Like many of the gorges of that region, the sides were more
abrupt than are usually found I amongst the hilly country of
Central Australia, and it seemed as though it would turn out a
gorge that would carry us easily, through the particular range
the rugged sides of which had frowned on us all the morning. It
got narrower as we proceeded, and on either side were detached
boulders that had fallen at one time or another from the sides.
Sometimes they had rolled right to the middle of the gorge, and
we had great difficulty in getting the pack-horses past.</p>

<p>'I hope we'll get out of this soon,' said Erskine to me in a
low voice, 'We need not expect a bite of feed anywhere about
here, and the horses did not have much between their ribs last
night.'</p>

<p>I pulled out my watch, for the gorge was now so narrow and the
sides so high that we could not see the sun. It was nearly three
o'clock, and, like Erskine, I sincerely hoped that we would soon
get on to less barren country. But it got rougher and rougher,
until it seemed that our onward way would soon be blocked
altogether, and we should have to retrace the long, weary way we
had already come.</p>

<p>At last, our way seemed barred altogether, at least against
progress with our horses, and we got off to examine the
obstructions, and see if we could remove them. They certainly
looked as though they had been placed there by artificial means,
and, leaving the boy to look after the horses, Erskine and I
clambered over the rocks and went on a few yards to see how it
was ahead. For a short while it was no better; then it suddenly
became clear, the gorge opened out, and evidently there was an
improvement in the country. We looked about, but could see no
tracks. Whoever had blocked up the passage had not been there
lately.</p>

<p>We came back slowly, and came to the conclusion that by
removing some of the worst boulders, which we might do by a
lever, we could get the horses through one by one. But where to
get a lever; the gorge was guiltless of timber, save for some
gnarled shrubs. We looked up and down the gorge in vain, no
timber was in sight anywhere.</p>

<p>I turned my attention to the boulders and saw something
strange about the one immediately in front of us. It was locked
in position by a good sized stone.</p>

<p>'Erskine,' I said, 'if we could shift that stone the boulder
would roll away of itself.'</p>

<p>'By Jove, it's been done that way on purpose; fixed so that
one man can shift the boulder if needed.'</p>

<p>'I don't quite see how one man could do it,' I replied.</p>

<p>Erskine regarded the stone with great earnestness. 'I think
the slightest jar would shift that rock, and there's something
about here to do it with.'</p>

<p>He began to search around, and the black boy and I followed
his example. True enough we found a long, heavy sapling concealed
amongst the rocks. Erskine poised it, and found that one man
could manage it. He chose his position, and gave the stone chock
a hard jarring thrust. It sprang out from under the boulder, and
the rock released from the check rolled on one side of it's own
weight. The first barrier was removed, but another and exactly
similar one lay next.</p>

<p>'Hold on a minute,' I said, 'This is all very well, but what
does it lead to? Whoever put these rocks in position did not want
any visitors. How many men did it take to chock these boulders
up?'</p>

<p>Erskine looked at them. 'Three could do it with good
handspikes.'</p>

<p>'Shall we go ahead?'</p>

<p>'I think so, there are only two more.'</p>

<p>In five minutes they were shifted with the same ease as the
first, and leading our horses through one by one we were soon
riding on again. Very quickly the gorge developed into an open
valley, and grass and timber began to put in an appearance. Still
there were no tracks nor signs of those who had blocked up the
gorge. Presently a watercourse began to form, and when others
came in it assumed the appearance of a good-sized creek. 'If we
get water we ought to camp,' I said. 'Then we shall have a clear
day ahead tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Erskine agreed, and within a mile we came upon a hole in the
sandy bed of the creek in which there was a very good supply of
water. Here with much satisfaction we turned out, but on
Erskine's suggestion we did not put the bells on the horses, as
we did not know whom we had for neighbors.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly, although we did not sleep very
sound, but everything was all well, and we were away from camp
soon after sunrise.</p>

<p>'How long do you think those stones have been there without
being moved?' I said as we rode along.</p>

<p>'A good while,' answered Erskine. 'I doubt If they have been
moved at all since they were fixed up.'</p>

<p>'How do you account for that?'</p>

<p>'Just as you suggested. The people who did It blocked the
place against possible visitors. They may have another way out
for themselves. I suppose they have found something good here and
don't want to be disturbed. May be gold, may be rubies.'</p>

<p>'You think it was whites then who did it?'</p>

<p>'Certain. Did you ever know blacks do such a thing?'</p>

<p>We rode on for five miles, keeping a good look out. The
country had opened out considerably, and we were riding through
a basin of open forest country which by the look of the ranges
closing in ahead was not of any great extent. The creek, however,
had rapidly attained a considerable size, and was well watered,
but, strange to say no tracks of natives nor signs of recent
encampments were anywhere visible. Soon rocky bars began to cross
the bed of the creek, and the ranges, rough and rugged, loomed
close ahead. There was no sign of a gap or gorge through which
the creek could issue out of the pocket, and we were wondering
what would become of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly and unexpectedly the question was answered. Erskine,
who was ahead, pointed to a light like that of a plain visible
ahead; then we saw the sheen of water, and the bed of the creek
suddenly became shallow, and finally lost, and we found ourselves
on the edge of the most dismal half-swamp, half-lake that I ever
saw. The shore was mud and shallow water, a few tussocks of wiry
reeds grew around, and a fringe of dead trees also bordered this
marsh. The range rose abruptly on the opposite side about half a
mile away, rugged, bare, and steep; and the marsh itself was
about a mile long, encircled, excepting where the range formed on
one side, by the ragged reeds and skeleton trees. From pleasant,
open forest country we suddenly emerged on to the dismal shore of
what seemed a marsh of death and decay.</p>

<p>'So that's what becomes of the creek,' I said. 'It drains into
this lovely swamp.'</p>

<p>'Seems like it,' said Erskine. 'There's not much catchment
area, so the soakage and evaporation account for any overflow;
but I never came across a basin shut in like this one is without
egress or ingress, except that gorge we came through.'</p>

<p>'And what's become of the men who blocked it up?' I said.</p>

<p>'Seem to have flown away. Devil a track of anything white or
black have I seen yet.'</p>

<p>'Which way?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Doesn't matter; whichever way our horses heads are, I
supposed. "Lay on, Macduff!"'</p>

<p>I followed the edge of the dreary swamp around, and Erskine
droned behind, and drove the spare horses with the blackboy.
Gradually we worked round the edge of the water to the range; but
still saw nothing of any tracks or camp. Presently, on one of the
dead trees standing at the edge of the sullen water I saw what
looked like a rope depending from one of the upper boughs. I rode
up to it, and, sure enough, it was a rope. But at the foot of the
tree lay a dank heap of rottenness and bones.</p>

<p>We got off our horses and looked at it. It was the remains of
a man, and a man who had been hanged. The rope had parted through
weather and decay, and the wretched thing had fallen to the
ground, and had lain there in the filthy ooze until only the
bones and rotting rags remained to tell us that it had been a
white man. The noose of the rope was still around the scattered
vertebrae of the neck, and beyond that another knotted piece of
rope told that the man's hands had been tied. The execution,
murder, or whatever it was, had been carried out with due
observance. It was no suicide.</p>

<p>The blackboy got a sheet of bark, and on it we put the
remains, and removed them to drier ground. There seemed no
article of any sort to determine who the poor thing was&mdash;no
watch, knife, or even a belt buckle remained; only the skull
grinned at us as if laughing at our attempts to find out who he
was.</p>

<p>'This licks creation,' said Erskine. 'What do you make of
it?'</p>

<p>'Only that there's been some sort of a tragedy here, and that
we'd better go round to the mountain, and then back up the creek
and get a decent camp, and turn out. We'll have to spend a day or
two here, and I'm hanged if I like this dismal swamp to camp
alongside.'</p>

<p>'Right you are,' said Erskine. 'I don't like the place any
better than you seem to do.'</p>

<p>We rode on round the edge of the lake to where it washed
against the foot of the range, and progress was stopped, but,
could see nothing to cast any light on the hanged man. Turning,
we went back, and, retracing our way a short distance into
favorable country, camped on the creek. It was still early in the
afternoon, and after we had turned out and fixed our camp our
talk naturally fell on the strange discoveries of the day.</p>

<p>'We might as well go and bury that unfortunate,' said Erskine,
as the sun began to sink. 'It is not more than a mile straight
across.'</p>

<p>I nodded acquiescence, and, with such tools as we could
muster, we started on our mission, leaving Paddy the blackboy to
mind camp. Presuming that the heap of bones and nameless
substance of some sort that represented defunct humanity was a
white man and a Christian, we buried him with what maimed rites,
we could remember, and then went back to camp.</p>

<p>'Where's Paddy?' said Erskine, looking round.</p>

<p>'Gone after 'possums, I suppose,' I answered, 'You never can
trust a blackboy to stop in camp by himself.'</p>

<p>Sundown came, but Paddy did not appear. Erskine made up the
fire and we had our meal as darkness fell, but still no sign of
the boy. We were discussing his strange disappearance, when
suddenly out of the darkness came a scared and frightened
Paddy.</p>

<p>'Man come up!' was all he could say for some time. At last,
when he had got his wind and had recovered a little courage, we
got a curious story out of him.</p>

<p>He asserted that after we left to bury the hanged man, a
strange white man had come to the camp. What the white man did or
said we could not properly discover, but apparently he had
frightened Paddy out of his senses, and he had cut and run for
it. He stated that the man pursued him, but he got away and hid
until dark; then he mustered up courage to return. The yarn was
altogether wild and improbable, or at least would have been so
but for our discovery of the body and the other singular
surroundings we had happened on. That the boy had got a good
fright was evident; but his story was so incoherent, that we
could not well comprehend it.</p>

<p>He described the man as partly dressed in rags, with a wild
demeanor, and eyes like a snake's.</p>

<p>'We'd better keep watch to-night,' said Erskine. 'Perhaps that
genius will pay us a visit.'</p>

<p>We kept watch, but the night passed untroubled. Only the
plover's melancholy cry came to us from the distant marsh.</p>

<p>In the morning Paddy showed us unmistakably the tracks of our
visitor. We had no desire to move our camp, but the blackboy
turned nearly white when we proposed leaving him alone in camp
while we pursued our investigations round the other side of the
lake. Finally Erskine volunteered to stop, for it certainly did
not seem safe to leave the camp and horses unguarded, with an
apparent lunatic knocking about. Paddy, it was evident, would
have cleared out and planted as soon as we were out of sight, so
I took him with me.</p>

<p>The end lake much resembled the one we had already gone round,
but there was no human body about. When we got to the range,
Paddy drew my attention to a cave, or what looked like the
entrance to a cave, some distance up. I got off, and, telling
Paddy to mind the horses, climbed up what appeared to be a
well-beaten path towards it. I reached the spot and looked in. It
was dark, and to enter one would have to stoop considerably.</p>

<p>I was just about to go in, when a yell of fright from below
startled me. I looked down. Paddy had scrambled on his horse and
was in full flight, my nag racing after him, while, pursuing both
was a half-naked figure, with long beard and hair, racing nearly
as fast as the horses. I was about to descend when It struck me
that the den of the creature must be in the cave and now that he
was not likely to return for sometime it would be a good chance
to examine it. Paddy would so to camp, and Erskine would dame
back to look for me, if the lunatic did not account for both. I
drew my revolver, and went into the cave. It was dark and
evil-smelling, so I struck a match, and by its flickering
light I saw that it was used as a habitation.</p>

<p>I had but glanced around when I was attacked and borne down by
the spring of a large dog, who commenced to worry my throat. If
It had not been for having my revolver in my hand I should never
have got up again. As it was, I fired three shots into the brute
before his grip relaxed, and I got up more or less damaged. I had
no mood for further explorations. I staggered out weak and
bleeding, and sat down to get my strength back. Then, after a
while, I got up and went down and bathed my wounds in the
lake.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE hurts were painful, but neither deep nor dangerous, and a
good washing would probably remove all possible venom of the
dog's teeth, so when I had washed them I went out on the bank,
and considered the position. It was possible that Erskine would
learn from the terrified Paddy where I was, and come to look for
me. It was equally possible that Paddy would be too frightened to
say anything, or that the lunatic would be too much for both.</p>

<p>I reloaded my revolver, and determined to start and walk; I
had great faith in Erskine as being an all-round man, but what
effect an excited nigger, chased by an equally, or more, excited
lunatic would have on his nerves, I could not say. Probably, he
would shoot the pair of them on spec; but he might get taken by
surprise, and fall a victim to the lunatic. Therefore, although
not much enamored of walking, I started back for camp at the best
pace my wounds allowed me.</p>

<p>I had gone about three miles, when to my great relief I saw
Erskine coming along towards me leading my horse.</p>

<p>'What's up?' he asked when we met.</p>

<p>'Paddy came home like a madman, your horse galloping after
him.'</p>

<p>'Anybody behind them?' I queried.</p>

<p>'No, not to my knowledge, but Paddy must have had the devil
behind him to judge from his looks.'</p>

<p>'Well, he looked very much like the devil, but as far as I
could see, he was a human devil.'</p>

<p>'You saw him then?'</p>

<p>'Yes. That's the only thing I did see, except when I went into
the old scoundrel's camp the dog tackled me, and got me
down.'</p>

<p>I showed him my wounded hands and arms.</p>

<p>'He'd got a dog, had he?' replied Erskine. 'What became of
him?'</p>

<p>'I shot him.'</p>

<p>'Let's go back and look at the cave. The dog's dead, and there
are two of us, so one can stop and look out for the madman.'</p>

<p>'And Paddy,' I said. 'Trust Paddy for looking after himself.
You bet he's up a hollow log by this time.'</p>

<p>I got on my horse and rode back to the range, and not feeling
very adventurous after my encounter with the dog, I stopped below
to guard the horses while Erskine entered the cave. He had been
gone about twenty minutes when I heard him calling to me.</p>

<p>'Will you come up?' he said, 'or shall I come down to you;
perhaps you're shaky still?'</p>

<p>He came quickly down to me.</p>

<p>'There's gold and rubies up there, a dead dog, and a dead
female. You can account for the dead dog; but how about the dead
woman?'</p>

<p>'How long has she been dead?'</p>

<p>'Goodness knows. She is a dried up mummy, and the gold and
rubies are strewn all over her. You can tell she is a woman by
the dress she wears. She's got up in state, and evidently the dog
guarded her body while the lunatic went wandering about.'</p>

<p>'Here's the lunatic coming back,' I said.</p>

<p>Sure enough the desperate-looking wretch came back, wild-eyed
as ever, but he would not approach us, but remained at a
distance, crying out to us to know if we were white or not.</p>

<p>It was long before Erskine could get near him and tell him
that we were willing to be friends, but at last he succeeded.
Then the haggard spectre approached.</p>

<p>'Come,' he said, 'and I will show you my home.'</p>

<p>Muttering to himself he led the way to the cave, seemingly
unconscious that we knew of it. I tied the horses up and
followed. As soon as lie entered, his eyes, better accustomed
than ours to the semi-dusk, detected the dead body of the dog. He
gave a wild shriek:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Plutus, you are dead; who has killed you?' looked round, and
fell in an epileptic fit on the earth.</p>

<p>We did what we could for him, but that was little. Presently
the convulsions subsided, and he fell into an unconscious state.
Then Erskine and I looked round the cave. On a slab of granite
lay, as he said, the body of a woman, shrivelled to a mummy. She
was dressed in an old dress, and on her lifeless breast lay a
little heap of gold nuggets and dust, and some dull, uncut
rubies. Not the common water-worn ones of interior Australia, but
stones which looked as though, like diamonds, they awaited the
mechanic's art to blossom out in their full lustre.</p>

<p>A movement of the man recalled our attention to him. He was
coming back to consciousness, and his eyes had regained their
sanity. But the man seemed dying. He looked round at us several
times as we wiped away the bloody ooze from his lips; then spoke
slowly, and with difficulty, and the tale he told was this:</p>

<p>'We came here, my mate and I&mdash;Franks was his name. I
hanged him out there on a dead tree in the lake.'</p>

<p>'Hanged him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I hanged him by myself, but first I had beaten him and
stunned him. Never mind, I hanged him all right. Why did I hang
him? Because the dead woman told him secrets she did not tell to
me. We found the dead woman here, at least. Plutus, my dog, found
her in this cave when he was hunting about. He found her, and
always stayed with her. She was like this when we found her, the
gold and rubies on her breast. After we had exhausted our wonder
and surprise, we talked long about it; and decided that there
were some ancient workings about, where some race of old had
worked, and this woman was some dead priestess of theirs.
Therefore, we must find these old workings. Then we blocked up
the passage.</p>

<p>'We looked for them for months, until we both got gloomy and
tired, and then strange things happened. The ghosts of the dead
came out of the lake, and told us how the flood in the past had
overwhelmed them and their works. Franks fell to coming to the
cavern and talking to the dead woman, and she told him things,
but me she would never speak to. So I determined to kill him, and
then for want of somebody else, she would speak to me. We fought,
and I beat him senseless. Then I took him round the lake so that
he could not come and speak to the dead woman, and hung him on
the tree while his senses were dead; and Plutus I watched me and
howled. But the woman never spoke to me, and I got so lonely that
I tried to find the gorge to get out again and find the horses we
had left. But I could never find it. The blacks must have closed
it up somehow. Then I remember no more, only that I lived here
with Plutus.'</p>

<p>This was the substance of his story, and Erskine and I had
before us the strange evidence of the mummified corpse, the gold
and rubies, and the stagnant lagoon, besides the dead man and the
dog. He never rallied, and our coining seemed to have snapped the
thread of his mad life.</p>

<p>We buried him and the dog beside the body of his mate, whom he
had murdered. As for the mummy, we left it in its sepulchre, the
cave, as fittest. But I the rubies and gold we took. We searched
throughout that strange basin, but found nothing more, and could
only believe that there was some strange tincture of truth in the
madman's yarn, and that some ancient race had lived and been
entombed in that strange valley, and the rotting waters of the
lake alone remained to mark their grave.</p>

<p>This happened in the early days of the overland line, and
none, as far as I know, have found the place since.</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>25. &mdash; THE PROGGLETON CUP</h2>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, 15, 22, 29 June 1878</h3>

<h3>1. &mdash; THE START</h3>

<p class="first"> "I THINK I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr.
Mascham before!"</p>

<p>Certainly she had that pleasure; I for one had not forgotten
it. And this is how it came about.</p>

<p>I like to lie in bed of a morning, consequently it generally
happens that I put in a late appearance at the breakfast table.
Where I am a privileged guest&mdash;as at Cumbeannah&mdash;I
don't object to this, in fact rather prefer it, for I hold that
it is much nicer to drop into the middle of a
conversation&mdash;to find one ready to hand than to waste time,
and good remarks probably, in vain attempts to start one. And
then if your bedroom window opens on to the garden, how
delightful to lie, and sleepily gaze at the blossoms peeping in
at you; perhaps a dewy rose-bud, with a fragrant good morning
breathing in every petal, or a spray of honeysuckle making as
though it would like to come in if only it were not too bashful.
It seems like repining at the goods the gods provide, not to
indulge in a dreamy half-hour between sleeping and waking, before
deciding to get up and encounter the prosaic outer world once
more.</p>

<p>It was at Cumbeannah, my partner Wilmot's station, that I had
been indulging in my favorite weakness on the morning on which my
story opens, and was late at breakfast as usual. There was a
small party of us there having a very jolly time of it. Wilmot's
idea of making up a lively party was original; his plan was to
get together as good a lot as possible, then dash an utterly
incongruous element right into the midst. The incongruous element
in this case was Proggleton&mdash;Proggleton, the Victorian
capitalist, who had been investing largely in western country,
and was now having a look round generally, and blowing the merits
of Victoria with a trumpet of great power and volume of
sound.</p>

<p>Queenslanders could only hide diminished heads when he
commenced to perform upon his favorite instrument But I must
apologise to the ladies, and beg Proggleton to fall back for a
minute, whilst I introduce them. First, there was Mrs.
Wilmot.</p>

<p>Gentle reader, please imagine the most amiable and most
lovable little woman of your acquaintance, and there you have
her. Nest came Miss Cassandra Mundersen, an elderly maiden sister
of Mrs. Wilmot; severe, especially upon her own sex, and with an
unmitigated down upon pretty girls. Then the two Misses Minchin,
Vanessa and Rhoda, passably good-looking, passably accomplished,
and carrying on alarmingly with Proggleton. Next, our beauty,
Miss Delhanty, good-looking&mdash;in fact, almost handsome but
undeniably stupid, running the two very hard for Proggleton.</p>

<p>Proggleton-n-n! I should like to give forth his name like a
bugle-call, but print won't do it! An unsanctified beast! He had.
been&mdash;well, there were half-a-dozen stories about his first
start in life, but that was nothing. He might have been a
hangman's apprentice, and then not a bad fellow&mdash;so long as
he did not talk shop. But what we (the male element) objected to
in Proggleton was not what he had been but what he was at the
period of my story.</p>

<p>Wilmot admitted that in this instance the dash of
incongruity was perhaps a little too strong; but he held out that
Proggleton was a rare study, that compensated for many
annoyances. The worst of Proggleton was the fact that he was
trying to correct his social education, and also to make
atonement to the letter <i>h</i> for his former ill-treatment of
it. I will say that for him, that he worked diligently to remedy
these deficiencies, and in both instances was partially
successful. Only partially! that was where the sting came in;
for, one minute he would be distressingly, oh, so distressingly
polite, and the next, blusteringly, oh so blusteringly, boorish:
you never knew where to have him. And his <i>h</i>'s took a mean
advantage of him at times, when he would at once go back and make
sure of them, which was amusing at first but aggravating after a
short while.</p>

<p>With the exception of Mrs. Wilmot&mdash;who gave him his fair
share of attention as his hostess, and no more&mdash;the women
went for Proggleton, and wore the Proggleton colors to a woman:
he was single! and so were they. Wilmot called it the race for
the Proggleton Cup, and used to say, "Wait! wait! I've got a dark
horse, who will force the pace directly."</p>

<p>This dark horse, I found out from Mrs. Wilmot, was a Mrs.
Peechy&mdash;a young widow, governess at the next station,
Mundarabba, who was expected over daily, in company with her two
young charges, aged respectively twelve and fourteen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmot would afford me no information about the personal
appearance of this mysteriously dark horse, saying I must judge
for myself; but from Wilmot's remark I concluded that she was
something striking.</p>

<p>There was another expected guest who delayed putting in an
appearance, and this was Master Jack Avington, an old friend of
Wilmot's and mine, who had ruined his liver in India, and was
trying to rectify it in Queensland.</p>

<p>Well, to get back to this eventful morning again; on entering
the breakfast room I saw that the seat next to mine was occupied
by an unfamiliar morning toilette, that there were two strange
girlettes at the table, and that when Mrs. Wilmot said "Mr.
Mascham, Mrs. Peechy," a pair of soft brown eyes looked up at me
as gravely as the eyes of a born coquette could look, and a
gentle voice said, "I think I have had the pleasure of seeing Mr.
Mascham before."</p>

<p>I can take a hint; and that look said, "No reminiscences at
present," as plainly as the tongue could have done; so I sank
down murmuring something about "feeling flattered at being
remembered," and commenced my breakfast and the solution of the
following enigma at the same time:&mdash;Why should Mrs. Peechy
require silence on the subject of the whereabouts of our former
acquaintanceship when we had simply been travelling companions
for a couple of days?</p>

<p>Unconsciously I listened to Proggleton telling some of his
European experiences to Miss Vanessa Minchin, commencing, "When I
was at 'ome." Here the strange presence of Mrs. Peechy put him
out, and he lost an <i>h</i>; he went back for it, however, like
a man, and went on, "When I was at <i>h</i>ome&mdash;"</p>

<p>I heard no more, for it suddenly flashed across me that Mrs.
Peechy did not call herself Mrs. Peechy formerly, but Miss
Probit.</p>

<p>Even so. It was twelve months ago, and she might easily have
married and buried a husband in that time, and be on the war path
again. Women are very quick in these little matters
sometimes.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which we met were as follows, if the
reader will allow me to run away from breakfast
again:&mdash;Ramshackle is a small bush township in
Queensland&mdash;anywhere you like; I won't be confined to
localities&mdash;consisting of a public-house, store blacksmith's
shop, saddler's shop, carriers' families, and goats. Cobb's
coaches made it a terminal point of one of their lines, and
bringing you from a railway station in a day and a half left you
to your fate and fighting rum, in Ramshackle.</p>

<p>I rode up to this pastoral municipality (a contradictory
denomination, but let it pass) one day, intending to leave my
horses, and proceed coastwards by coach. I had scarcely
dismounted when a buggy, driven by a stern-looking gray whiskered
old gentleman, and containing one lady passenger sitting behind,
dashed up and pulled in, right at my horses' heels. The lady got
up to descend, the grim driver looked neither to the right hand
nor to the left, but straight between the horses' heads; and,
being so close, I stepped up and offered my assistance.</p>

<p>An accurately-gloved hand was placed for a moment in mine,
very well-made figure balanced itself easily on the wheel, and
then came lightly to earth beside me. By this time a rising young
Queenslander had gone to the horses' heads, so the veteran got
down, and, still maintaining the same unbroken silence, marched
into the sitting-room of the public-house and rang a fierce peal
on the little hand-bell. The lady seemed rather undecided, and I
certainly felt so: first she looked at a corpulent portmanteau in
the buggy, then she glanced through her veil at me, and very
bright eyes looked. I took the hint, also the portmanteau,
travelling bag, shawls, too, and carried them on to the verandah.
Out marched the white moustache, walked past both of us, looking
apparently into space; reascended the buggy, gave young
Queensland a cut with the whip in return for holding the horses,
and disappeared at a hand gallop.</p>

<p>But for the substantial presence of the lady, the corpulent
portmanteau, and the travelling wraps, I should have put it all
down as an optical delusion. Apparently an elder sister of young
Queensland now appeared to show the forlorn fair one a room, and
favoring me with a gracious bow she disappeared, and I was left
to go back to my interrupted task of unstrapping my valise. This
accomplished, and my horses confided to the original young
Queensland to take to the paddock.</p>

<p>I went into the public house, and after the manner of my
countrymen had some bad brandy and water on the strength of my
perplexed mental condition. The maid of the inn looked full of
profound importance when laying the tea things in the little
sitting-room that the inn boasted; the boy's boots she wore
stumped and creaked twice as loudly as usual, as though they
would proclaim some dreadful secret if not well watched. In fact
the air of awful mystery that appeared to hang about the place
was more befitting a haunted castle on the Rhine than a
three-year old township in Queensland.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I was not at all sorry to see the
late arrival come out of her room, without her hat and veil, and
give me a chance of verifying the opinion I had formed that she
was a very pretty woman. I was quite right; she was very pretty,
and, what's more uncommon, was capitally dressed. She had bright
brown eyes, plenty of good hair, and cheeks and chin that fitted
on to her white throat as though they belonged to it&mdash;not as
though they had been put there by mistake. Add to all a
remarkably graceful carriage that was evidently studied, but none
the less pleasing, and she was decidedly a remarkable sort of
woman to meet up the country.</p>

<p>She chatted well and easily about the topics of the day during
our meal, although our ministering attendant still contrived to
throw a dash of gloom over the banquet. However, I learnt that we
were to be fellow-passengers in the coach that left in the
morning, and I retired to rest on a bed 18 inches broad and 5
feet long, congratulating myself on my luck in having such a
pleasant companion to go down with.</p>

<p>One strange thing I noticed, that throughout the whole evening
the fair unknown never afforded me the slightest hint as to her
name or residence, although on finding that we were to be thrown
together for the next two days I had at once introduced
myself.</p>

<p>As for the mysterious handmaiden, she said, "I don't know,
sir," to any questions I put to her, so that I was altogether
floored. The <i>incognita</i> was up betimes, and, unlike all but
the very youthful of her sex, looked as well in the early morning
as at any other time; so after having had the felicity of helping
her up on to the box-seat, and taking my place beside her, we
lost sight of Ramshackle just as the sun rose.</p>

<p>What a change came over my companion; as the last galvanised
iron roof-top was shut out by a clump of brigalow, she became as
confidential as heart could wish! That was her uncle who had
driven her up to the township; such an old darling, but in great
grief about his only son, who had done something&mdash;something
wild (here my fair informant got rather vague and very red),
and&mdash;and she had gone up to the station to obtain his
forgiveness, and, having made his peace, was going back to send
the prodigal home rejoicing. She was so glad that really the
inconveniences of the journey were as nothing.</p>

<p>I remarked that she must have had a little trouble with her
uncle, as he had an extremely determined look about the face. No,
I misunderstood it&mdash;he was the kindest, best of men; but
they had agreed not to speak at parting, lest emotion might
overpower one of them; they had said good-bye before starting
from the station, so that what I took for ill-temper was only
deep-seated grief&mdash;too deep for words.</p>

<p>So with this thought "we skipped our dear uncle," and
following the advice of the immortal Walrus "talked of many
things." We were the only passengers; the driver's soul was
centred in saying "Hi! get along up, down there!" to his horses;
so it was a delightful <i>tte--tte</i> the whole way down. My
charming companion seemed to have seen plenty of the world, and I
began to wish we could drive on together for a week at least.</p>

<p>Having to help a lady in and out of a coach five or six times
a day must of necessity force the intimacy very quickly, not to
mention the hundred and one little wants that have to be attended
to, and which give the gentle one an sir of proprietorship in you
that she is seldom slow to take advantage of. By the time we
readied the flourishing seaport of&mdash;anywhere Miss Probit had
got into a pretty way of ordering me about that completely did
for me; I was almost gone, but not quite.</p>

<p>No! not quite, but the last night nearly finished me. The
steamer was to leave on Monday morning, and we got in on Sunday
evening. There was nobody to meet Miss Probit at the railway
station&mdash;her brother whom she expected could not have
received her telegram; so I had to procure the young lady rooms
at a quiet hotel, and as it was Sunday evening she expressed a
great wish to go to church. Of course I could do no less than
escort her there, and to see the look of pious devotion that came
into that Madonna face was worth watching.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Pensive nun! devout and pure,<br>

Sober, steadfast, and demure.</p>

<br>

<p>How could a man help falling in love with her? Why, when with
clasped hands she gazed reverently up at the clergyman during the
sermon, even he was affected, and preached quite a poetical
sermon about "Angels upon earth in the guise of women," etc., and
finally, when the benediction was pronounced, she drew a deep
sigh and looked around with startled doves' eyes, as though she
had been away somewhere in Paradise, and was astonished to get
back to earth again.</p>

<p>So we said good-bye in the private sitting-room of the select
family hotel (vide advertisement), and her voice faltered as she
thanked me for what she called my care and attention; we would
soon meet again, she was sure; and she gave me a look that nearly
made me own up to a hopeless passion. "Good-bye, good-bye, my
kind&mdash;friend!" and with tear-blinded eyes she left the room.
And now&mdash;that we did meet again&mdash;it was evidently to be
on the coolest terms of intimacy.</p>

<p>Who can understand a woman? Of course I did not expect she
would jump up in a dramatic manner, crying "My friend! my
guardian I do I see you at last? It is too much," etc. But why
this stern silence? Not even the most distant allusion to the
many adventures we had on the road down, not the faintest
suspicion of a smile.</p>

<p>I engaged Proggleton in a fierce argument, and vanquished him.
I flirted desperately with Miss Delhanty, who was trying to pique
Proggleton. I felt very bitter, and smoked a wrathful and moody
cigar on the verandah when breakfast was over. I was alone, I
thought, and would have liked to have said "ha! ha!" in a
fiendish manner&mdash;if I had ever been acquainted with a fiend,
so that I could imitate him; but my education had been neglected
in that respect, so I could only puff volumes of smoke into the
passion-fruit.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mascham," said a well-known voice, "do, do let me
apologise for my apparent forgetfulness just now; but if you knew
how&mdash;how&mdash;" By this time a soft warm little hand was
squeezing mine penitently, and I was protesting&mdash;"Really,
Miss Probit&mdash;I mean Mrs. Peechy&mdash;there is nothing to
a&mdash;apologise for."</p>

<p>"But there is. I must explain that not for worlds would I have
it known that I was at all mixed up in that sad affair of my
brother's."</p>

<p>"Your cousin's, was it not, Mrs. Peechy?"</p>

<p>"I mean my cousin of course. You, I am sure, will respect my
confidence; I feel so safe in your hands; with anybody else it
would be different. I would not dare to ask them; but with
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>So a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, was ratified
forthwith, and in discussing several things appertaining thereto
I forgot to ask Mrs. Peechy how it was that she had changed her
name to quickly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peechy was a great addition to our party, and, as Wilmot
said, she would force the pace with a vengeance. Proggleton was
greatly struck, and the Minchin and Delhanty party came on with a
rush, but had to fall back again. I felt rather jealous of
Proggleton at times; but the way in which she used to mimic him
when we were by ourselves was sufficient to put my mind at ease.
Mrs. Peechy could sing very well but could not play, and was
dependent on the other ladies for an accompaniment. She had a
fresh strong voice, and great confidence: if&mdash;to use a
favorite Americanism of the present day&mdash;if she did not
exactly fetch the note she went after, she brought down something
very near it. But the other girls invented another source of
annoyance.</p>

<p>As I said before, Mrs. Peechy could not play, and when, with
apparently the best intentions in the world, one of the opposite
faction would sit down to accompany her, just when the songstress
wad soaring amongst her clearest notes and warbling in her most
expressive manner&mdash;crash would come some horrible discord in
the accompaniment, and then the fair pianist would stop abruptly
and apologise so sorrowfully&mdash;it was so stupid of her; she
knew she could not play such a difficult accompaniment; she ought
never to have tried; and the smiling young widow would look like
a fair saint undergoing martyrdom, but blessing her persecutors
to the last; leaving me lost in admiration at the wonderful
self-control of women. We had to thank the restraints of modern
civilisation that there were not "wigs on the green" many a night
in that drawing-room.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Peechy had a tower of refuge in Miss Cassandra: she
fought fair; there was a good deal of the masculine element about
the "Oracle," as Wilmot used sometimes to call her, from a habit
she had of delivering her opinions in three short pithy
sentences&mdash;and she scorned taking petty advantages; so if
she played she played conscientiously, and we got some very good
music in the evenings.</p>

<p>But Proggleton was the grandest study at this time; he so
evidently felt that he had perfect command of the position, and
had only to throw his highly-scented handkerchief whenever he
chose and wherever he chose. Not Malvolio himself behaved more
fantastically at times than did this impersonation of capital.
And then the hidden virtues that the women discovered in him! He
was such a sterling fellow! Really, after all, intrinsic worth
was far before mere outward refinement; he was so genuine, so
frank, so different from the stereotyped people you met every
day; so everything&mdash;but rich. The dear girls all protested
in one breath that his wealth was his least charm. Not but what
they were informed often enough of his store of
treasure&mdash;laid up certainly where moth and rust do corrupt
(but fashion changes too quickly now-a-days for moth to trouble,
and rust does not sully gold)&mdash;but very tantalising for all
that Proggleton the victorious, the irresistible, spared no
opportunity of boasting of his financial transactions, and spoke
as carelessly of thousands as Wilmot and I would of shillings.
The social atmosphere was charged with a kind of monetary
electricity that became often so oppressive that we used to feign
business out on the run to get a little fresh air.</p>

<p>"I wish Jack would turn up," said Wilmot one day, as we were
returning homewards from one of these excursions; and it really
seemed as if his words had invoked a spirit, for the sharp canter
of a horse sounded suddenly close behind, and the missing
Avington pulled up between us.</p>

<p>"Talk of the devil," I said, not very politely, as I shook
hands with him; "and why did you not let us know you were
coming?"</p>

<p>"And what detained you?" added Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Business! Business! most important business!" returned Jack,
with a laugh. "But really I did write, only I must have got ahead
of my letter, for when I got to Willis' I found that you had not
sent anything&mdash;either buggy or horse&mdash;to meet me, so
borrowed this animal, and came on."</p>

<p>"Well, your presence is earnestly desired: we are at war, old
man. You have doubtless read a good deal lately about labor and
capital being antagonistic; here you will see it exemplified, and
you must join the ranks as a combatant. Wilmot and I at present
represent labor, Proggleton personifies capital."</p>

<p>"Proggleton, I know him; at least, met him once. Victorian
man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"He is an interesting product of that modest little
colony."</p>

<p>"I can reach his weak point; he's fine fun."</p>

<p>"But the women are all on the capital side, or on the side of
capital, whichever you like, Jack."</p>

<p>"All of them? One ally in that quarter would be
invaluable."</p>

<p>"Oh! Alice of course is strictly neutral," said Wilmot; "but
there's Mrs. Peechy; you might call her undecided."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peechy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; governess from Mundarabba; she's here with the
youngsters."</p>

<p>"Young, good looking?" queried Jack.</p>

<p>"Both," I replied; and as we were now close to the station
little more was said. I was wondering what sort of an impression
our widow would produce upon the new arrival; but was hardly
prepared to see her give a very evident start at the sight of
him&mdash;a start she cleverly covered by pretended terror of a
lizard that just then ran across the verandah.</p>

<p>"I thought it was a snake, Mrs. Wilmot; and it went straight
for the children; it gave me such a start!" she said with a
pretty blush. Jack's face betrayed nothing.</p>

<p>It might have been fancy on my part, but I felt sure she was
looking at Avington and not at the lizard when that scared look
crossed her face. Our old friend was a glorious acquisition; the
conversation grew quite healthy again. Proggleton fought hard,
but was continually getting worsted. Jack would lead him into a
discussion and get him excited; the inevitable consequence would
be the defection of an <i>h</i>; then, while Proggleton was back
looking for the delinquent, Jack would quietly pass the argument
over his head to somebody else, and when our millionaire came up
to time again with the culprit letter he would find himself quite
left behind in the conversation.</p>

<p>But Proggleton bore it, and bore it quietly to my surprise. He
and Mrs. Peechy were very confidential just at this
time&mdash;much to my chagrin&mdash;and I think she must have
given him a hint that open hostility would not avail against an
enemy who was so cunning of fence.</p>

<p>But now a strange event happened that added considerably to my
perplexity, and deepened the mystery that seemed to enshroud this
too confoundedly good-looking widow&mdash;at least I began to
find her so. But it must be reserved for the next chapter in this
small romance.</p>

<h3>2. &mdash; FORCING THE PACE</h3>

<p class="first">
THE third night after Jack's arrival it was full moon, and,
enticed by the beauty of the night, we sat smoking on the
verandah until the small hours were almost upon us. Wilmot
retired first, followed by Avington&mdash;the ladies having been
gone for some time. I commenced another cigar, and after favoring
Proggleton with monosyllabic answers for some time had the
satisfaction of seeing that worthy take his departure, and leave
me the sole occupant of the verandah.</p>

<p>There was not a cloud visible, nor a breath of wind stirring,
yet the night was comparatively cool; so calm was it that the
flowers in the garden seemed really sleeping, and you could
almost imagine that they would wake with a little start if you
went and touched one of them. I think I must have been asleep
too, as my cigar was out, and on looking at my watch found it was
half-past two o'clock, when the sound of voices aroused me. Just
for a second I heard them, some little distance away, and
seemingly speaking in an undertone, but the night was so wondrous
still that the slightest sound was audible.</p>

<p>After listening some time I could hear nothing more, so
concluded that it was some of the men talking in one of the huts
a short distance away. Throwing my lifeless cigar on to the
grass, I was on the point of rising when I became aware of the
fact that somebody was walking towards the house. Wondering much
who it could be at such a time, I remained quiet. This late
visitor approached the gate of the garden, and after a minute's
hesitation, and apparent examination of the premises, entered and
came to the front of the house.</p>

<p>Seated as I was in the shadow of the verandah, and partly
hidden by a passion-fruit vine, I was invisible; but the
intruder, standing on the little lawn in the white moonlight, was
as plainly to be made out by me as if it had been the brightest
noon. He was a stranger, a young-looking man, dressed like any
ordinary traveller or sojourner in bushland, carrying in one hand
a riding whip, in the other a white pocket-handkerchief; this
last he displayed in a very ostentatious manner, almost as though
it were a signal he was waving. Concluding that it must be
somebody who had business on the place, but was unwilling to
disturb all the household at such an unseasonable hour, I was
about to make my presence known, when another actor appeared on
the stage.</p>

<p>This person came out of the house and advanced to the middle
of the verandah; this person was a woman, but so muffled up in a
long wrapper as to be almost disguised; this person made angry
gestures to the man outside to go away, and, throwing a piece of
crumpled paper towards him, vanished back into the house as
silently as she had appeared. This person&mdash;unless my brain
was wandering&mdash;was Mrs. Peechy.</p>

<p>I don't think any of the other ladies could have achieved the
graceful sweep with which she turned&mdash;fortunately away from
the direction where I was seated, an interested, if bewildered,
spectator. The stranger picked up the piece of paper, looked at
it closely by the moonlight, and walked away.</p>

<p>Should I follow him? Out?</p>

<p><i>Cui bono</i>! He would hardly tell me his business, and
although in one sense I had a right to ask it, in another I had
not; for evidently Mrs. Peechy had some sort of knowledge of him,
and if she chose to transact business at half-past two in the
morning, why who can baulk a fair lady's inclinations? Certainly
it was not an amorous assignation: the coldest lover would hardly
have gone away contented with such a hasty and distant interview,
particularly when there was apparently no fear of
interruption.</p>

<p>Thinking that Mrs. Peechy would in all probability be awake,
and remembering with what awful distinctness sound is conveyed
through a silent house at night, I&mdash;not wishing her to know
that I had witnessed her strange interview&mdash;took off my
boots, and stole to bed like a ghost. But I had noted the man's
face well, and, having a little talent for sketching, I drew his
likeness from memory in my sketch-book the next morning, and
succeeded rather happily so far as I could remember. He was a
good-looking fellow, with a certain flash air about him; looked
as if he was a constant attendant at race meetings and other
places where horsey men most do congregate.</p>

<p>Who so fresh and <i>debonnaire</i> at the breakfast table the
next morning as the smiling young widow? Apparently not a thought
or care had put a mark on the eyelids that enshrined those bright
eyes, or traced a line on that smooth forehead. Proggleton was in
great force; she was especially gracious to him that morning,
and, in spite of all the doubts that harassed me, I was
proportionately jealous.</p>

<p>Being in this spiteful frame of mind, I took a very mean
revenge, that makes me blush to remember. We happened to be alone
in the drawing-room shortly after breakfast, and I drew her
attention to a book of engravings. She walked right into my
trap.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wilmot says that you sketch, Mr. Mascham. I should so
like to see your sketches; will you show me some of them." This
in her archest manner. Muttering some feeble protests, I produced
the little book and handed it to her. She commenced turning over
the leaves, commenting in the usual style of a lady critic:</p>

<p>"And this is Cumbeannah from the plain! Oh! what a dear little
cow! How nicely you have this, but," etc. She was now almost at
the page on which I had that morning sketched the likeness of her
nocturnal visitor, and the next instant turned the leaf. The
fidelity of the sketch to the original was guaranteed, for she
turned white to the lips, and I felt as mean as a man could feel
at seeing it, and knowing that I had caused it.</p>

<p>She quickly recovered her courage, and, making no attempt to
disguise that she had been hard hit, closed the book, and,
handing it back to me, looked straight into my eyes coolly and
boldly. "Do your wont," that look seemed to say: "I will explain
nothing; I defy and disdain you!"</p>

<p>Under her gaze the thought crossed me, how unwarrantably cruel
I bad been to let her know that I had witnessed her interview
that morning; to have seen which any of the laughing girls on the
verandah would have given me one of their pretty little ears.</p>

<p>I took the book back, and her hand with it.</p>

<p>"Trust me," was all I could say for apology, but she seemed to
understand that I meant that her secret was safe, for she pressed
my hand, and genuine tears of wounded pride came into her eyes as
she turned away. I put the sketch-book carefully under look and
key, and joined Wilmot, Avington, and Proggleton, who were
talking on the verandah, feeling that in more ways than one I had
made a false step.</p>

<p>Jack was just commencing an old Indian yarn, apropos of
something that I had not heard.</p>

<p>"Well he was about the coolest fellow I ever met. Once he
received what he considered a very impertinent letter from a firm
in business, under the name of Peake and Allen, actually
requesting payment of their account which had only been
outstanding three years. He was of course very indignant at such
presumption, and replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen,&mdash;I am astonished and grieved in no slight
degree at the tone of your letter, especially as the fact of your
not having been paid rests entirely with yourselves. Some years
ago I determined to pay off my debts alphabetically, and had you
started in business as Allen and Peake, instead of Peake and
Allen, your account would long since have been settled. As it is,
I am afraid you will have to wait some little time, as I have not
yet succeeded in liquidating further than the letter B. And at
that letter I believe he stuck."</p>

<p>"And I suppose took care never to deal with a firm whose name
might endanger his assets," said Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Did I ever tell you about Macgruffin's widow?" asked
Proggleton.</p>

<p>"No! I should like to hear it," said Avington with suspicious
warmth. "Do any of you know Macgruffin? As if any of us would
know a man with such a name!"</p>

<p>Now, as Proggleton is not a very euphonious appellation, this
was a trifle rude, but you must have noticed, dear reader, that a
man under the influence of the tender passion is very often
rude.</p>

<p>"Well, Macgruffin was a fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I presume," said Avington blandly, "but I thought you were
going to tell us about his widow. If the man was alive it must
have been his wife."</p>

<p>"No, it was another man's wife who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what business had he with another man's wife?"</p>

<p>"No, no, another man's widow."</p>

<p>"But I thought you said it was Macgruffin's widow?"</p>

<p>"Wait till you hear," protested Proggleton. "We used to call
her Mac's widow because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure she was a widow?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sure?&mdash;of course. Macgruffin's widow was the name she
went by."</p>

<p>"Then what was her real name?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh do get on," said Wilmot, "I'm so interested."</p>

<p>"But they keep interrupting me," replied the millionaire, who
was getting excited.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mr. Proggleton?" said Mrs. Wilmot, who
just then joined us.</p>

<p>"Mr. Proggleton is going to tell us an amusing story, and we
were delaying him till you were here to hear it," returned
Jack.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said our fair hostess, "if Mr.
Proggleton will allow me to make one of his audience."</p>

<p>But that gentleman had turned sulky, and declined to satisfy
our curiosity. It had just dawned across him that Jack had been
bantering him, and the Padisha-like airs that he had been giving
himself lately had elevated him to such a height in his own
imagination that he could not brook such treatment, and stalked
away to find consolation at the hands of Miss Vanessa
Minchin.</p>

<p>The girls had got their riding-habits on, and we were about
starting for a ride as soon as Mrs. Peechy put in an appearance.
This she did almost directly, and looked so well in the dress
that so very few women can wear with impunity that Proggleton
immediately deserted Miss Vanessa&mdash;much to that young lady's
disgust, and pushed forward to assist Mrs. Peechy to mount
Greatly to his surprise, his services were declined, Avington
being the lucky man selected for the duty. This surprised me, for
Jack and the widow had not become very intimate during his short
stay. However, the fair ones having been safely got to horse, we
started.</p>

<p>Proggleton was rather out of temper, for I had taken his place
with the lately-deserted Vanessa. Her sister Rhoda and the
Delhanty were riding one on each side of Wilmot, and, to judge by
their merry laughter, being most successfully entertained by him.
Avington and Mrs. Peechy had dropped some what behind, so he was
for a time an unhappy odd man until Miss Delhanty beckoned him to
join her in a canter.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed my companion about half-an-hour after we
had started, "how slowly Mr. Avington and Mrs. Peechy are
riding." I looked around, and certainly the pair in question did
not seem in any hurry to diminish the distance that separated
them from the rest of the party&mdash;seemed rather bent on
increasing it.</p>

<p>"Piqued by Jack's indifference, and trying to bring him in
captive," was the mental conclusion I arrived at, so dismissed
the subject from my mind and devoted myself to the sprightly
Vanessa, who was really a very nice girl&mdash;apart from the
common failing of her sex,&mdash;and for that she had to blame
the accident of her birth.</p>

<p>"Are you a good actor?" said Miss Vanessa suddenly, as if
inspired by a hasty thought.</p>

<p>"Not particularly so," I replied; "but why do you ask? What
recent act of hypocrisy have you detected me in?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean socially speaking; you are not at all a good
actor there," and she glanced archly back at the pair behind us
as though to point the thrust.</p>

<p>"What I mean is in private theatricals. As you know, we are
all going over to Munderabba for the races they are about to get
up there, and this morning were talking of trying something of
the sort at night, if you gentlemen will put your services at our
disposal."</p>

<p>"Mine you may be sure are always at your disposal."</p>

<p>"Don't mistake me for Mrs. Peechy. But do you think that Mr.
Proggleton could act?"</p>

<p>"Yes; act the part of a bear," I said savagely.</p>

<p>"That's rude. He's a very nice fellow, and why you should all
pretend to run him down I can't understand."</p>

<p>"He's such a favorite amongst you ladies that we are jealous
of him."</p>

<p>"I really believe that is the reason, although you only spoke
in jest. But to return to our former subject: Will you act?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I am wanted, and you are going to be one of the
company."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peechy is, which will be a greater attraction for
you."</p>

<p>"And who are the others?"</p>

<p>"Well, we reckoned on you, Mr. Avington, and Mr. Proggleton.
My sister does not care about acting, and Miss Delhanty could not
remember ten words of a part."</p>

<p>"But will none of the others at Munderabba be available?"</p>

<p>"No; we shall have no opportunity to rehearse with them, so we
must get-our material here."</p>

<p>"Well, I am always at your command, and I can answer, I think,
for Mr. Avington. Mr. Proggleton will doubtless be only too glad;
there's a character in 'She Stoops to Conquer' would suit him
admirably."</p>

<p>"Spiteful again. How jealous you must be of his favor with
Mrs. Peechy."</p>

<p>"At any rate Jack is in a good place in that race at
present."</p>

<p>"Yes, they seem to have a very engrossing topic behind there.
Let us canter on, then perhaps they will follow."</p>

<p>There was to be a display of social fireworks at Munderabba,
the station where Mrs. Peechy had charge of the education of the
rising generation. Picnic races were to be the order of the day,
and we were all going over in a body.</p>

<p>Our neighbors there, Mr. and Mrs. Blackstock, were a very
worthy couple, with a tendency to put on "side;" but it was a
harmless failing, and we all liked them very much. Mrs.
Blackstock always had a pet subject for the time being, to bore
people with, and just now it was her astonishing good luck in
obtaining the services of Mrs. Peechy to educate her
daughters.</p>

<p>True, it was a pity that the widow could not play; but still
her daughters were very young, and in everything else Mrs. Peechy
was far above the average; and as for her French, her accent was
of the purest. As neither Mrs. Blackstock nor her husband
understood a word of French, I was rather puzzled to know how
they had determined the purity of Mrs. Peechy's accent.</p>

<p>But what had evidently been the substantial foundation upon
which Mrs. Blackstock had erected her temple of admiration of
Mrs. Peechy was the aristocratic nature of the testimonials she
had produced&mdash;brought with her from England. They had, to
use an Americanism, quite "fetched" Mrs. Blackstock. First there
was one from Baron Blumenthal, written in such marvellously bad
English, and in such a scrawling hand, that nobody could read it.
Next, the Countess of Turnberry's handwriting bore witness to the
pain with which the countess had parted with Mrs. Peechy. There
were several more, all titled names, that Mrs. Blackstock showed
me one day in a fit of confidence; but one signed "Jean Vicomte
d'Abord" attracted my attention, because I felt certain that I
had seen the handwriting before&mdash;when or where I could not
recall, but I was convinced that I knew it; however I said
nothing, but quite agreed with Mrs. Blackstock as to the high
value of the treasure she possessed.</p>

<p>Men are curiously constituted in one particular&mdash;that is,
that let a woman once establish herself in your fancy, and no
amount of mystery enshrouding the object of devotion will shake
your fealty. A sort of innate loyalty to the clay-fashioned idol
of one's own making keeps one from accepting anything except the
most unmistakable testimony. So it was with me at this time; the
widow had thrown the spell of her brown eyes over me; and, though
I felt that there must be something very strange in her
antecedents, I still used to admit to myself at times that it was
on the cards that I might make a fool of myself.</p>

<p>Our rehearsal now became the amusement of everybody. We had
Wilmot as prompter and general stage manager, and the ladies who
were not going to act as an audience. Miss Vanessa, being a
clever girl, came out very well, but as for Mrs. Peechy&mdash;she
was the admiration of everybody.</p>

<p>Her impersonation of character was certainly good, but her
knowledge of stage business was the great secret of her success.
She made every point tell, and knew exactly where to place
herself so as to make them of the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>But Proggleton was immense! Avington and I entered into a
solemn compact to fool him to the top of his bent, and we
succeeded to perfection. We did it of malice aforethought, and
the womenfolk aided and abetted&mdash;doubtless with ulterior
motives, but still in a manner that kept the Victorian in a state
of self-complacency it would have been hard to shake the
foundation of.</p>

<p>In the last scene of the little comedy we were rehearsing he
had to fight a duel with Avington, and in this situation he
really fancied himself. He used to march to his place as though
he was the ghost of Hamlet's father amalgamated with Lord
Chesterfield, and extend his arm with a look of gallant
determination on his face that fairly convulsed poor Jack, and
put him <i>hors de combat</i> before the fatal shot was fired.
However, it all went down splendidly; the women kept their
countenances to perfection, and Proggleton became convinced that
he had missed his vocation in not taking to the stage earlier in
life.</p>

<p>It was a very fair race between Vanessa and the widow at this
period; as Wilmot expressed it, the betting was level, and he'd
put his money on either horse. But I must say that my feelings at
the time were not enviable. I have already taken the reader into
my confidence as to the true state of my inclinations; but I was
sedulously striving to keep my partner and Avington in the dark.
They both thought that I had a fancy for a desperate flirtation
with the widow; but neither gave me credit for the deeper
emotions that were plaguing me. And so the time drew on for the
races at Munderabba, only one noticeable event occurring in the
meantime. In the duel scene we had to use revolvers, they being
the only stage property available.</p>

<p>One afternoon soon after lunch we strolled out a short
distance from the house, and were amusing ourselves with a little
pistol practice; presently the ladies joined us, and some of them
expressed a desire to try their bands at shooting. Miss Delhanty
was the first to take pistol in hand, and, with many affected
little screams and starts, put us all in mortal terror of our
lives until Wilmot steadied her wrist, and the revolver and a
shriek were discharged together.</p>

<p>Miss Vanessa, supported by Proggleton, made a very fair shot
at a big gum tree, which was tied by Mrs. Peechy, and, as none of
the others wished to distinguish themselves as marksmen, Miss
Vanessa and Mrs. Peechy had another trial of skill.</p>

<p>Really it was, above all, a capital study to note the two
women; and, in the cynical frame of mind I then was, I enjoyed it
immensely. Both were so conscious of their good looks, and
adopted so many little artifices to heighten them.</p>

<p>To see the fair Vanessa lift the pistol, glancing archly along
the barrel with a roguish smile like a modern Cupid taking aim at
one of his mother's doves; then lower the weapon again,
complaining in a playfully pettish manner&mdash;with a
comprehensive look all round that was meant to finish everybody
within killing range&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, it is no good my firing; I am sure I can't hit anything;
or I shall shoot somebody, I know I shall."</p>

<p>Then Proggleton tried a compliment about her eyes, and
shooting people, in which he got very much mixed, so that nobody
could possibly make head or tail of it; but doubtless Vanessa
thought that the intention was good at any rate, for, re-assured
by it, she took aim anew, and, more by good luck than management,
put a bullet right into the mark she was aiming at. And then with
what a little laugh of satisfaction she surrendered the pistol to
her rival, who took it with the most loving smile that ever
beamed on a woman's face; although I have not the slightest doubt
that she would have put the deadly bullet it contained into a
carefully selected spot in the well-fitting dress of the lady
handing it to her, and have slept the sound slumber of triumphant
innocence after it. Mrs. Peechy took the revolver and looked very
confidently along the barrel.</p>

<p>"By Jove," whispered Jack to me with a chuckle, "if we would
only all clear out and leave those two together they'd measure
off twelve paces and settle the thing quietly without any
seconds."</p>

<p>The widow, knowing that the attitude she was standing in
displayed her lithe figure to perfection, remained with arm
outstretched and her well-poised head slightly thrown back,
taking a quiet steady aim while a man might count thirty; then
she fired. Those who had sharp eyes could see the bark fly close
to where Vanessa's bullet had entered. Avington went over to the
tree. It was a very pretty shot, having struck within an inch of
the other ball&mdash;the mark she had aimed at.</p>

<p>"Allow me to compliment you on your skill, Mrs. Peechy," said
Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Was it really a good shot, Mr. Wilmot?" she returned in an
amusingly ingenuous tone.</p>

<p>"A very good shot with such an uncertain weapon as a
revolver."</p>

<p>"But it was quite an accident, quite. I never fired a pistol
before in my life." When a lady chooses to make a statement of
the foregoing order, who shall refuse to give it credence? But I
know I never saw Jack Avington look so grave in all my life, and
yet somehow I found it impossible to catch his eye.</p>

<h3>3. &mdash; THE FINISH</h3>

<p class="first">
PROGGLETON, the Proggleton of every-day life, was irritating,
exasperating, and aggravating enough, goodness knows; but
Proggleton on the racecourse at Munderabba, arrayed in a silk
jacket&mdash;like Joseph's coat of many colors&mdash;elate with
the prospect of carrying off the Ladies' Bag, the great event of
our little meeting, basking in the smile of the widow and the
maiden&mdash;generally speaking more blatant and self-asserting
than ever&mdash;what was he but a thing to be remembered for
years in bad dream; he was a fit of indigestion incarnate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peechy had made his jacket, Miss Vanessa his cap; he had
lost gloves to the ladies and had won small money bets from the
rest of us, so that nothing was wanting to complete his
satisfaction. Had he lost a bet of ten shillings the thought of
it would have hung like gloomy shadow over the rest of the day's
pleasure, and completely ruined it.</p>

<p>The races promised to be a success. In addition to our
somewhat large party from Cumbeannah, the other stations round
about had contributed contingent, and matters were getting off
very smoothly.</p>

<p>One of the chance visitors attracted my notice from his
resemblance to the nocturnal visitor to Cumbeannah; in fact so
closely did he resemble the individual in question that I felt I
could safely put him down as the man. Young Blackstock introduced
him as Mr. Probit, and, from what I could gather, his
acquaintanceship with him must have been of very recent date.
Beyond the fact that he was there, and had been staying in the
neighboring township for the last week or two, nobody seemed to
know anything about him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peechy had preceded us to Munderabba by a couple of days,
in order to assist Mrs. Blackstock in her house-hold preparations
for the entertainment of her guests, so that it was impossible to
judge upon what footing the widow, and the mysterious stranger
had first met, but on the course they seemed rather
distant&mdash;at least on the lady's side.</p>

<p>The Ladies' Bag was the race about to come off, and Avington,
Proggleton, and I were all going to ride for the prize, which of
course contained contributions from all the fair ones of the
district. Wilmot had given Jack and the Victorian the pick of the
horses on Cumbeannah, to ride over and enter for any of the races
if so minded; and the millionaire, with his usual luck, had
secured the smartest horse we had on this place, so that lie
stood a very favorable chance of carrying off the victory. There
were about ten entries altogether, and only for Proggleton's bad
riding the race would have been a foregone conclusion. As it was,
it was well contested by three&mdash;Avington, Blackstock, and
Proggleton. I was about twenty yards behind them, and the rest
nowhere, when they passed the winning-post.</p>

<p>From my position I could not see who was the winner, but what
I saw was Jack's horse stumble and fall as he was pulling him in,
and when I got up Master Avington was picking himself up with a
broken collar-bone. A sapling cut close to the ground in clearing
the course had caused the mishap, which fortunately was no worse,
as had it happened during the race the rider's neck would most
likely have suffered.</p>

<p>Avington got any amount of sympathy of course, and, after
fixing him with a figure-eight bandage and sling, he watched the
rest of the proceedings In state, surrounded by an attentive bevy
of self-constituted nurses. But he had won the race, much to
Proggleton's disgust, who was third, Blackstock being second,
only a head behind Jack. Proggleton turned very sulky
immediately. I am not sure but that he felt rather rejoiced at
Jack's mishap, and looked upon it as a judgment upon him for
daring to beat such an important individual as himself. Miss
Vanessa tried to console him, and seemingly succeeded so well
that she flattered herself that she had scored a point; but then
the widow showed out equally well in her gentle attentions to the
disabled winner, so that even a rival had to confess the power of
such an exhibition; and perhaps after all she scored as many as
the artless Vanessa.</p>

<p>But the last race was over, the private matches decided, and
we all adjourned to the station, when a new difficulty arose.
Jack's accident threw our private theatricals out of gear: who
was to take his place? Proggleton was awfully put out at the idea
of all his rehearsals being wasted, and got sulkier than ever.
But an unexpected volunteer put in an appearance: no other person
than the mysterious Mr. Probit. He said that he had acted the
part before, and, give him time to read it over once or twice,
thought he could manage to get through with it. Need I say that
his offer was joyfully accepted? The girls had killing dresses
prepared for the occasion, and it would have been a thing to be
deeply deplored that they should not have had the opportunity of
displaying them.</p>

<p>It was a calm night, and we had fixed the verandah up as a
stage, the audience being seated in the open air. This was Mrs.
Peechy's idea, and met with universal approbation. Behold us all
then at 8 o'clock taking final looks at our parts, and feeling as
though we should like to back out at the very last moment.
Proggleton was very nervous indeed.</p>

<p>"I feel as though I could not remember a word," he said to me,
piteously. "I know that new fellow will put me out; I had got
used to Avington, and he would prompt me a little; but now I'm
awfully nervous."</p>

<p>I comforted the despondent amateur as well as I could; but I
did not feel so very confident myself, particularly when the
curtain drew up and I had to face the audience with a soliloquy
to start with. But I got through it, and when Mrs. Peechy came on
the stage we got on swimmingly, and the first scene closed amid
loud applause&mdash;the new actor, Mr. Probit, turning out a
first-rate acquisition. Proggleton managed to stumble over his
part in the next scene, was cleverly picked up by the widow, and
put on his feet by Miss Vanessa; and the first act was over.</p>

<p>Proggleton wiped his perspiring brow and fortified himself
with some brandy and water whilst the ladies were making some
change in their dresses for the next act. Probit was standing
idly toying with the revolvers that were to form the firearms in
its duel scene in the third set, and I was looking at him and
wondering who the deuce he was. Was he the cousin that Mrs.
Peechy bad interceded for with her stern looking uncle? If so,
why not acknowledged as such? Why set as strangers towards each
other? Had his sin against society been of so deep a dye that he
could not be reinstated? or what was the meaning of it. Certainly
if he had been a relation of mine I should have been very glad to
have had an excuse to shunt him, for he was anything but good
form; at least that was the idea that struck me in my then savage
state of mind.</p>

<p>I was interrupted in my train of thought by a remark of
Proggleton's&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are those things loaded?"</p>

<p>"I believe not: but I'll put the blank charges in," returned
Probit.</p>

<p>They were Tranter revolvers of the old-fashioned style, and
were to be loaded with powder for the duel scene, in which Probit
took Avington's place, The remark had scarcely been made when
Miss Vanessa tripped lightly into the room, and going up to
Proggleton, asked him coquettishly to button her glove for her;
and of course he was only too glad; and of course she slowly
strolled away off the stage, and he, in duty bound, followed,
just as Mrs. Peechy came in and was about to make the same
request to him if she had not been forestalled, Failing him, she
turned to me, but I was sulky, and, after buttoning the glove as
required, fought shy of any little flirtation, and pretended to
be absorbed in looking over my part for the next scene, and, with
it in my hand, I went off just as Mrs. Peechy was addressing some
remark to the mysterious Probit, which I did not catch.</p>

<p>I strolled once up the verandah and back again. Somehow the
scene that I saw on my return has always been fixed on my memory.
As I said before, the stage occupied the centre part of the
verandah, and the audience ware sitting on chairs put out on the
lawn in front. The verandah being temporarily enclosed with
calico, the stage only occupying about 15 feet or so, there was
of course a wide space on each side. I was walking up and down
one of these wide spaces, the widow was on the part forming the
stage, and the rest were on the other and of the verandah. Mrs.
Peechy was standing near the table whereon the pistols were
lying, looking fixedly and fiercely away from me at&mdash;There
were two figures standing at the far end, in partial shade, and
remarkably close to each other, a decidedly lover-like position
in fact; but she was not looking at them with such a vindictive
look in her brown eyes; there was a man standing half-way, a man
looking moodily down, and kicking one foot impatiently against
the verandah post, whilst his hand twisted his manuscript part
about. Probit and the widow was looking at him, or I was much
mistaken. I turned and walked back. When I reached the end the
bell rang for us to commence the second act, and the mock comedy
took the place of the real one.</p>

<p>After the second act was over I had not to appear again, so
took my place amongst the audience, between Jack&mdash;who was
furnished with an easy chair&mdash;and Mrs. Wilmot We wars all
watching anxiously for Proggleton's appearance in his pet
situation, and when he did come on we greeted him with a round of
applause that made him beam with self-complacency. The quarrel
commenced, Probit acting really well. In due time the pistols
were produced and the ground measured; two quick reports, one
much louder than the other, and Probit fell&mdash;everybody said
in a most ungainly and unnatural manner. It might have been so,
but still when Wilmot and I went on to the stage he was as dead
as a man could well be, for Proggleton had shot him through the
heart.</p>

<p>Amidst the scene of dismay and excitement that ensued I can
distinctly remember two things: I never saw a woman more calm or
self-possessed than Mrs. Peechy was; and I never saw a man with a
look of greater horror on his face than Jack Avington&mdash;but
then perhaps he had not quite got over his fall.</p>

<p>Poor Proggleton, I did feel for him. When he kept piteously
explaining to everybody that he could not possibly be aware that
the pistol was loaded, he was an abject spectacle. He evidently
thought that he would be hanged, and every bit of windy conceit
and self-sufficiency vanished at once under the thought of such
an impending doom.</p>

<p>When we got things a little quieter, and began to enquire into
the affair, it really was a most inexplicable accident. The
unfortunate man had loaded the revolvers himself; I saw him doing
it, so did Proggleton, and, to the best of her belief, so did
Miss Vanessa Minchin; so also did Mrs. Peechy; he was doing it
when I buttoned her glove for her.</p>

<p>How could it have happened? It was a perfect mystery that no
one could solve, and the unhappy victim, whom no one knew, was
buried before it was solved. Was it ever solved? Partly,
perhaps.</p>

<p>A magisterial enquiry was held as to the cause of death, and
Proggleton was acquitted of all blame; but the shock had done our
friend good, and when he took his leave of us he was a
milder-mannered man than when I first introduced him to
the reader.</p>

<p>And the Proggleton Cap was still unwon: Vanessa had played
every card in her hand, but she had not the nerve of her rival;
when everybody was helpless and worse than useless, the widow had
come to the fore. Mrs. Blackstock might retire to her room and
become invisible, indulging in wild lamentations that such a
thing should have happened in her house. Old Blackstock might
indulge in unlimited nips with, and tearful partings from his
guests; but the widow took the reins of government into her
hands, and elicited everybody's admiration by the way in which
she handled the team.</p>

<p>Wilmot and I remained behind to render what assistance we
could, and, when a day or two afterwards we rode over to
Cumbeannah, we found everyone still full of the sudden
catastrophe that had put a stop to our merrymaking. Proggleton
was on the eve of departure, only awaiting our return to start to
the congenial climate of that little colony that bean the name of
our Queen. Jack was low-spirited and reserved&mdash;something
more than the fall had evidently upset him. Mrs. Wilmot looked
rather fagged and bored, and a decided change had come over our
little party of a week ago. Proggleton left Combeannah, and as an
active character he disappears from this narrative. That he did
not propose to Hiss Vanessa before leaving was evident: first,
because of the peculiarly snappish temper that young lady evinced
towards every woman she came In contact with; and, secondly,
because of the more than amiable manner she developed towards
Jack and me, the only two eligibles left within range.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the accident at Munderabba, old
Blackstock drove over with Mrs. Peechy to call on Mrs. Wilmot,
Jack was still wearing his arm in a sling, and resolutely kept it
there, so that he was not able to benefit by taking the hand the
fair lady so kindly extended to him. Mrs. Peechy was
leaving&mdash;was going south as soon as Mrs. Blackstock was
quite recovered from the shock to her nervous system caused by
the sudden death of Probit I heard the news without any feeling
of sorrow; my passion, or rather infatuation, had received a
sudden check&mdash;as sudden as the unfortunate man who succumbed
to Proggleton's bullet; in fact, I was rather glad to hear that
she was going, and looked on at the loving farewells extended to
the ladies on Cumbeannah with perfect equanimity. Vanessa and the
widow parted like heart-broken sisters; I don't mean to say that
some of the stern joy that warriors feel in foemen worthy of
their steel was not in that embrace, but the outward and visible
sign was one of deep and tender sorrow. And whilst, they were
wiping tearless eyes and watching the disappearance of the buggy,
the widow's character suffered severely, yon can easily
imagine.</p>

<p>Then the paternal Minchin came for his daughters and Miss
Delhanty, and we were left alone with the events of the past to
talk about.</p>

<p>In about a month Jack's arm, or rather shoulder, was quite
well, and at about the same time a notice in the Melbourne
<i>Argus</i> informed us that Mrs. Peechy had won the Proggleton
Cup, her marriage with Proggleton being chronicled therein.</p>

<p>"Come for a stroll, old man; I want to speak to you," said
Jack, after we had discussed the above item of news. "Do you know
what Mrs. Peechy, as she chose to call herself, was when I first
knew her."</p>

<p>"No, but I always thought you were old friends or
acquaintances, whichever you like to call it."</p>

<p>"Yes, so we were. Of course I never said anything even to you,
because it was a woman's secret, and as such sacred; but now it
can do no harm, and there is another subject I want to talk to
you about Mrs. Peechy was a clever little second rate actress in
Brussels."</p>

<p>"Which accounts for her knowledge of French and singing,
without any other accomplishment."</p>

<p>"Yes, and that poor devil who was shot at Cumbeannah was her
husband."</p>

<p>"I half guessed something of the sort, but not quite that How
did you know it?"</p>

<p>"I met a fellow some eighteen months ago who told me the
story, not thinking that I should see the end of it. This young
Probit's father had a station; being a very strict and severe man
with his children, as a natural consequence the boys all went to
the bad as soon as they got out on the world, and the eldest one
married our friend the late governess at Munderabba. Old Probit
was in England at the time, and when he came back and found that
Us son had taken unto himself a wife without his sovereign leave
or pleasure, and that moreover the said wife had nothing but her
face as a fortune, he was pretty disgusted. There was no
particular reason for his cutting up so very rusty about it, for
the girl was quite good enough; in fact, too good for the
unfortunate fellow; but he was one of those domineering old fools
who want everything done according to their orders. So rows very
soon commenced on the station. You can fancy that the widow, as
we thought her, was not the sort of person to be sat upon with
impunity; she has a very pretty notion of taking her own part;
doubtless also she began to find station life, with a fool for a
husband, rather monotonous. Anyhow, things came to a climax at
last, and they agreed to separate, the old man offering to give
her a certain sum of money on condition that she took another
name. She jumped at the offer and came away." (I thought of
Ramshackle, and the parting there.)</p>

<p>"Young Probit took to drinking after his wife was gone, and
finally his father hunted him. I suppose he has been wandering
aimlessly about the country ever since, till his unlucky fate
drove him here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was hard-up, and thought to get some money from
his wife?"</p>

<p>And I told Jack about the scene I had witnessed at Cumbeannah
in the early morning.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Avington, "I begin to see things clearer now. I
remember my informant told me that he thought he had degenerated
into a third-rate bookmaker, or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"But, Jack, do you think she was seriously in earnest, or only
going in to cut the other women out? I mean at the start."</p>

<p>"Heaven knows! Trusting to the chapter of accidents."</p>

<p>"Accident! Was it an accident?" Jack looked at me when I made
this remark, and I saw that the same awful thought had struck
him.</p>

<p>"No; it can't be. Surely she had no hand in it?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of it before, because I did not know that she
had such weighty reasons for Probit's death. But if anybody
touched the pistols after be loaded them it was Mrs. Peechy."</p>

<p>"Did you see her touch them?"</p>

<p>"No; but she was standing by herself at the table where they
were lying."</p>

<p>"This must be a secret between us; it can do no good now.
Whether shot by accident or on purpose, the man is dead. She is
married again, and a deuced deal too good for the man who has
her."</p>

<p>"Queer morality, Master Jack; but what magnificent pluck that
woman mutt have. If she did put the bullet in the pistol, and
make that brute commit a murder, just remember how perfectly calm
she was. She was the only woman there who showed any
self-possession at ail."</p>

<p>"The more I think of it, the more satisfied I am that she did
do it. The pistols were different sizes, and it would have been
easy for her to ensure Proggleton getting the one loaded with
ball. It was a sudden thought, and but for that unlucky spill I
got that fellow might have been alive now."</p>

<p>"Oh dear; I ought to be very thankful to Proggleton, for, but
for him, I might have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all, old man," said Jack, taking my arm. "Her secret
was safe with me only so long as the ordinary run of mortals were
concerned. A fellow must draw the line somewhere, and with regard
to her I drew it at you. She might hare thrown the hatchet
anywhere else with impunity."</p>

<p>"And she did. But that murder was too awful. I hope it was an
accident. What made you look so cut up that night? You suspected
nothing then?"</p>

<p>"No; but the woman's callousness horrified me. I knew it was
her husband who was killed."</p>

<p>"Jack, who was the Vicomte d'Abord?" I asked, as a sudden
thought struck me.</p>

<p>"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices, etc.," said
Jack. "I remember at a quiet little supper years ago, in that
jolly town&mdash;when you know it&mdash;called Brussels, Miss
Peechy announced her intention of leaving the stage and getting a
billet as governess somewhere. It was hailed as a good joke, and
we all wrote her recommendations on the spot I confess that I was
the Vicomte d'Abord."</p>

<p>"And what shall we do about this affair?"</p>

<p>"Do? What can we do? The man's dead. It's all surmise on our
part. She's won the cup; let her keep it. But my dear fellow,
don't you think it's a retribution on our Victorian friend? I
trust she won't get number three to put him out of the way for
her."</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>26. &mdash; THE MEDIUM</h2>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, 12 February 1876</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE end of a dry season; the roads foot deep in dust; the
grass, what was left of it, as brown as grass could be; the
waterholes dwindled down into puddles of liquid mud&mdash;in
fact, everything looking just as it always does after an
Australian drought, as though it only wanted a fire-stick put
into it to burn the whole concern up, and forestall the last
day.</p>

<p>It was just sundown one day, daring this desirable, period of
the year, when a traveller came cantering along the road leading
to the Stratford station. On he went, raising as much dust as a
marching regiment would in any other country, until he pulled up
at the slip rails, dismounted, let himself and hone in, and
wended his way up to the homestead.</p>

<p>The house he was approaching was the usual style of thing in
the bush: two or three rooms, and verandah, with smaller huts
scattered around. A very tall man was leaning against one of the
verandah posts, smoking. He turned as he heard the horse's tread,
and welcomed the horseman by the name of Jackson. They shook
hands, Jackson unsaddled his horse, and they went inside. The
tall man's name was Starr, and he was the owner of the place.
Jackson handed him a couple of letters, remarking as he did so
that he heard he was mustering, and had come down to look after
his cattle if it was the case.</p>

<p>"No," said Starr, as he broke the envelopes, "I was only
getting some fat cattle for Blatherskyte; I start to-morrow with
them."</p>

<p>"The beggars told me you were mustering down hen, so I've had
my ride for nothing. Luckily I am not very busy, for one can't do
much till we get some rain."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to see you down here. Tea will be in
directly."</p>

<p>"I will just rinse some of the dust off," said Jackson,
stepping into one of the bedrooms.</p>

<p>A trampling was just then heard outside. Starr went out, and
was immediately greeted by name by one of the newcomers&mdash;a
young and good-looking man. The other was dark-eyed, with a black
moustache, and rather a theatrical looting personage.</p>

<p>"Why, Starr, you an looking jollier than ever. I think you
have grown even taller since I last saw you."</p>

<p>"Glad to ate you back again, Harris," returned Starr as they
shook hands.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haughton," said Harris, indicating his companion.</p>

<p>Starr bowed, and Jackson made his appearance, giving his face
a finishing rub with a towel.</p>

<p>Harris and he were old friends, so his greeting done, and Mr.
Haughton having been presented for the second time, they went
inside.</p>

<p>"What is the news from Blatherskyte, Harris," said Starr, when
they were all seated at tea.</p>

<p>"Any amount of gold being got by some; nothing by others. Mr.
Haughton is one of the unlucky ones."</p>

<p>The other two glanced enquiringly at the stranger, who had
scarcely spoken as yet. He remarked that he had been up there for
the last six months, that he went on to the field with money, and
had now scarcely enough left to carry him off; so his luck had
not been in.</p>

<p>"Everybody drunk last night," said Harris, taking up the
thread. "We were going to have a concert, but the singer got too
drank to sing, and the audience to listen&mdash;so that it was a
failure as far as the melody of the affair went. You are going up
to-morrow, did you not say, Starr?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I start in the morning, with some bullocks, and expect
to get in some time during the nest day. Any water at the
twenty-mile creek?"</p>

<p>"Yes, enough to do you, and that is about all. When will you
be back?"</p>

<p>"I intend to come straight back the day after I get in. I am
going down to Imberwalla, to take down some gold I want to get
rid of."</p>

<p>"You will be worth sticking up."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall; for old Jawdon, the butcher, owes me for half
of the last draft, which I shall get this time. I shall have
about seven hundred, mostly in gold."</p>

<p>"Well, that is not such a great sum, but many a man has lost
his life for less.</p>

<p>"I hope that is not going to be my case," replied Starr; and
after the usual bush talk about horses and cattle they rose from
the table.</p>

<p>"Where is your old hut-keeper?" said Jackson, after the things
were cleared away. "I had a row with him thin morning; he had
been here too long, and was getting cheeky, so he went this
morning. This man happened to be passing, and wanted a job, so he
got the place."</p>

<p>"I never did like that other fellow, he had an evil look about
him," remarked Harris.</p>

<p>"He was a very good cook," returned Starr. "Let us have a game
at whist," he said, rising. "Do you play, Mr. Haughton?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind taking a hand."</p>

<p>They sat down, Harris and Jackson against Starr and Haughton.
They played for some time, but after the first game or two all
the luck went over to Haughton and his partner. Harris, who was a
volatile sort of fellow, after a great deal of restlessness,
proposed changing the game to euchre. The game was changed, but
not the luck; Haughton and Starr still won. It was about ten
o'clock when they left off playing, the winnings then amounted to
a couple of pounds or so.</p>

<p>Haughton proposed to his partner 'that they should play
off&mdash;who took the lot. They did so, and Haughton won.</p>

<p>Starr rose, and, going into his room, brought out a couple of
pair of blankets.</p>

<p>"You will have to be contented with a shake down to-night, Mr.
Haughton; I have no spare bed to offer you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will do right enough," said the other, smilingly. "I
will sleep in the verandah; it is cooler."</p>

<p>He went outside, after bidding the others good night Jackson
was sitting on the table, playing at patience with the cards.</p>

<p>"Well, I intend starting early to-morrow, so shall say good
night," said Starr.</p>

<p>"All right; but don't go just yet; it's not so very late. I
have any amount of news to tell you, but I cannot get it all out
at once," returned Harris.</p>

<p>"Well, let us hear some of it."</p>

<p>"You know Rowdy Jack, who was horse breaking for you. He has
got board and lodging at the expense of the country for three
years."</p>

<p>"It is certainly news that he has got it, but none that he
deserved it, Anybody else come to grief?"</p>

<p>"Yes, two or three married."</p>

<p>"You call that coming to grief, do you?" said Jackson, putting
the fourth storey on a card house.</p>

<p>"In most cases I do," said Harris.</p>

<p>Jackson's card house came down with a run. "What do you know
about it," he said.</p>

<p>"I am a married man, and speak from experience."</p>

<p>"You married, Harris! You are only joking."</p>

<p>"No, unfortunately, I am not. You two fellows are old friends,
so I will tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"When I came out here ten yean ago a regular new chum, I went
up to live at Bloomfield's station, on the Wantagong. I had been
up there about two years, and being only a raw, foolish boy found
it very dull after the first novelty wore away. The place is all
cut up into farms now; it was pretty well selected on even when I
was there. I got very intimate with one of the selectors, an old
fellow named Delaney, who used to live upon his wits I suppose,
for it was very little I ever saw growing on his selection. I
said that I got intimate with him. I ought to have said with his
daughters. They were the attraction. The eldest I thought a
regular beauty. Looking back on her now with the utmost
detestation, I must admit she had remarkable good looks. She
possessed a great deal of tact, too, and concealed her defects of
manner and education admirably. I fell over head and ears in love
with her; she was two or three yean older than I was, and could
do anything she liked with me. One day I called just as the
priest, one Father Carroll, was leaving. I went in and found Mary
crying, sobbing at least. Of course I was up in arms directly,
and when we got by ourselves I insisted upon knowing the cause of
it After a great deal of feigned bashfulness and reluctance, she
told me that Father Carroll, whom the Lord confound, had been
warning her, telling her that my visits were becoming common
talk, that I was only trifling with her, meant nothing serious,
and all the many hints you can imagine. L am convinced now that
this was nothing else but lies from beginning to end. Father
Carroll, who was much respected in the neighborhood, knew too
much of her to talk in that strain; repentance was the subject he
would be most likely to choose for his homily. I confounded him
just now, for if his name had not been introduced I do not think
I should have been worked upon like I was. How I could I have
been such a mad infatuated fool is incredible to me now. But I
was only a boy, and she and the devil had regularly ensnared me.
I had a little money, not much; rumor had greatly magnified it,
and they thought they had a prize. Anyhow, to make short work of
it I married her that day week. I left the cottage immediately
after the priest had married us, and hastened home to prepare a
place to take my wife to. When within two miles of home I met a
man on horseback. He pulled up at we came together, and I
recognised a young fellow who had left the station shortly after
I arrived on it.</p>

<p>"'I was looking for you,' he said. 'They told me I should find
you down at old Delaney's. I am looking for some horses of mine
that are running down this way. Mr. Morgan (the superintendent)
told me that you knew where they were running." I was in a hurry,
but the horses were no distance away I knew, so I turned off to
show him the place. He commenced asking me about the people in
the neighborhood as we went along; he said that he had been in
Queensland ever since he left the station, and only came back two
or three days ago.</p>

<p>"'You have been down seeing the Delaney, girls,' he went on to
say; 'how is Mrs. Morgan?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Morgan," I said. "I don't know her."</p>

<p>"Why Mary Delaney, of course. Did you not know that she
consented to be Mrs. Morgan for six months or more? She might
have become Mrs. Morgan in reality, for she was making a regular
fool of him, but old Bloomfield in Sydney heard of it, and he saw
that he had either to lose her or his billet, so he sent her
away. That is not the first trial she has had of married life,
and her sisters, I suppose, are running the same track. They say
that you are down there pretty often.</p>

<p>"He had scarcely finished speaking when we caught sight of his
horses, and he started after them, leaving me to meditate on the
pleasant piece of information he had just imparted to me.</p>

<p>"I did not do anything sudden or rash, but rode quietly home.
Next morning I left the district, never to return. I wrote to her
a letter I do not think she would forget very easily, and have
made her an allowance&mdash;as much as I could afford&mdash;ever
since, on condition that she never called herself by may name or
attempted to join me. She consented perforce, for I went to New
Zealand, and remained there for three years."</p>

<p>"Have you heard of her lately; are you sure your information
was correct?" said Starr, after a pause. "I have; and her conduct
since my departure fully comes up to, nay exceeds, the character
I heard of her."</p>

<p>There was a pause of some minutes, during which the regular
breathing of the sleeper outside could be heard. Jackson's
attention was attracted by it.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" he said, in an undertone to Harris, indicating
the object of his remark by a move of the head.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I only met him a day or two ago, and we
travelled down together. He says that he has been in the
army."</p>

<p>"Looks more like a skittle-sharper," said Starr, rudely.</p>

<p>"Don't be spiteful now, because be won when you played off!"

<p>"Not I, bat I saw something that you fellows didn't see. The
stakes were not worth making a noise or a scene about, but the
cards know him as well as he knows them."</p>

<p>"What! did be cheat?" said Harris, turning as red as fire.</p>

<p>"Something very like it."</p>

<p>"Confound him for ever. To think of my baring brought him
here. Old Fitzpatrick introduced him to me; he seems to hare been
educated, and I supposed that he was as good as most of the other
men you meet. Of course, Harris, it is impossible to know what a
man is from just riding along a road with him. Good night," he
went on, shaking hands, "we shall have breakfast at sunrise
to-morrow, but you need not get up unless you are going to start
early too."</p>

<p>"I am off the first thing," replied Jackson. "And Harris, of
course you will come to my place to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I hare a good mind to wake Mr. Haughton up, and tell
him something that will stop him from proceeding with us
to-morrow. I feel almost as though I had been found out doing
something dirty myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said Starr, "it is not worth speaking about;
only don't play at cards with him any more."</p>

<p><br>
BY sunrise next morning breakfast had been despatched, and the
horses were ready, saddled. Haughton complained of an attack of
fever, and declined any breakfast. Starr and Jackson bade him
good morning, and made some ordinary remarks. Harris stalked by
him like a muzzled tiger past a shin of beef. Haughton took no
notice of his changed behaviour, though it was open enough. He
said that he would ride slowly and overtake them in an hour or
two if he felt better. The station was soon tenanted by the cook
and stockman only. Haughton's horses were in the yard, and about
an hour after the others had left, the men saw Haughton catch and
saddle them, then ride away along the same road taken by Jackson
and Harris.</p>

<p>They had pushed on, and by three o'clock arrived at Jackson's
station, Glenmore. Harris was easily persuaded to stop the next
day, the station of which he was superintendent being only
fifteen miles distant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haughton does not seem to be showing up," he said, as he
was preparing to start the following morning.</p>

<p>"No, he could not help noticing your behaviour towards him. I
will be down your way in a day or two&mdash;good bye."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
ON the second day after Harris' arrival at home, Jackson rode
up to the station, a black boy following him. Harris came out to
meet him, and was immediately struck by the grave expression of
his friend's face.</p>

<p>"Why, Jackson, you look serious enough for half-a-dozen
parsons; what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Starr has been murdered," returned Jackson, shortly.</p>

<p>"Good God! You can't mean it!" But Jackson's face assured him
that he did mean it.</p>

<p>"He was found dead at Yorick's Lagoon, shot through the head.
Here is his black boy, Dick, who found the body."</p>

<p>Harris turned to the boy. "Mr. Starr been killed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; ben shootem here," touching the top of his head.</p>

<p>"Had he been robbed too, Jackson?"</p>

<p>"There were no tracks of any other horse but his own within two
miles of the place; no signs of a struggle, and his body
appeared to be untouched by anybody after falling."</p>

<p>"And the gold?"</p>

<p>"No gold was found upon him. Some papers, two or three 1
notes, and some loose silver, were all the articles of valve on
his person. His hone was found with a mob of station horses, but
without the valise, which Dick says was on the saddle when he
left the Blatherskyte diggings. This is all I can learn from
Dick. If you can come we will start back at once. An inquest will
be held to-morrow or the day after; Williams has gone up to
Blatherskyte."</p>

<p>All that was elucidated at the Inquest was, that on Monday,
the 24th of January, James Starr had left Blatherskyte diggings
alone, leaving a stockman named Williams and the black boy, Dick,
to come on slowly. He was not again seen alive by anybody then
present.</p>

<p>Williams stated: That he was a stockman in the employ of the
deceased; assisted him to drive a mob of fat cattle to
Blatherskyte; that he left the diggings on the same morning,
though some hours later, than the deceased did; a storekeeper of
Blatherskyte, named Thompson, and the black boy, Dick,
accompanied him; went as far as the creek called the
"Twenty-mile," and camped there that night; arrived at Yorick's
Lagoon about twelve o'clock; saw the body of a man lying at the
edge of the water; the upper portion of his body was on a log;
went over to it and found it to be the body of his employer,
James Starr; a bullet wound was visible on the top of his head;
appeared to have been dead about twelve hours; the body was quite
stiff; deceased had some gold in a valise on the front of his
saddle when he left the diggings; did not know the amount; found
his horse close to the station, with some other station horses;
the saddle was on the horse, but no valise.</p>

<p>Thompson's testimony was to exactly the same effect. Jawdon, a
butcher of Blatherskyte, stated that he paid the deceased the sum
of one hundred and sixty ounces of gold, and a cheque for 155,
before he left the diggings; it was in payment for cattle sold
and delivered to him by the deceased; saw the deceased put it
into a valise and strap it on in front of his saddle; made some
remark at the time about the horse getting away with it on; Starr
left his place immediately afterwards; did not see him stop
anywhere as long as he was in sight; believed that he went
straight away. Williams, recalled, stated that after finding the
body the black boy, who was an excellent tracker, want round with
him to look for trades; no fresh tracks of either hone or man,
excepting the track of deceased and his horse; knew the track of
deceased's horse by his having been newly shod on the diggings,
and having a very peculiar shaped hoof; could swear to it; had
shod the same horse himself at various times; the track of
Starr's horse went straight to the place where the body lay, and
from then back to the road, and along it until the horse joined
the mob be was found with; the lagoon was a small piece of water,
about five miles from the station, close to the road; saw no
horses tracks on the other side of the lagoon; it was about
thirty to forty yards broad; cattle had been watering on the
opposite aide of the lagoon during the previous night; saw fresh
tracks of a large number; saw the tracks of Starr's horse all the
way along the road to Yorick's Lagoon; saw no other fresh tracks;
met no one on the road.</p>

<p>The medical testimony showed the cause of death to tare been a
bullet wound in the top of the head; bullet produced was a small
one, seemingly belonging to a very small bored rifle. Jackson and
Harris were examined, but of course their testimony threw no
light on the affair.</p>

<p>Suspicion first settled on Starr's discharged cook. He was
found at a public-house, some fifty miles from the scene of the
murder. Had gone there direct from the station, and had been
there ever since, "on the spree." Several witnesses could swear
to his presence there at all hours of the day and night. Haughton
was then enquired for, and found at Imberwalla. Proved to have
stopped at a shepherd's hut six miles beyond Glenmore station,
the night after he left Stratford; he accounted for not calling
at the station by mentioning the changed manner of Harris towards
him; arrived at Imberwalla three days afterwards; had to camp on
the road, on account of sickness; was still suffering from fever;
did not possess either a rifle or revolver; had not had one for
the last six months.</p>

<p>A verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons is
unknown was returned; but years passed and nothing ever
transpired. Dick went into the service of Harris, and one day
passing the scene of the tragedy he persuaded Harris to ride
over, and then made an explanation which seemed to have been
troubling him.</p>

<p>"You see, Mitter Starr bin get off to drink, lay down like it
there, doss up along a log. Some fellow been come up along on
other side, you see, where cattle track big fellow come up. That
fellow bin shoot em Mitter Starr when he bin stoop down drink.
Then go away along a cattle track. Cattle come up along at night,
look out water, put em out track all together."</p>

<p>Dick's conclusion struck Harris as being correct, but it went
no further towards pointing out the murderer.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
MORE than twenty years after the events of the chapter,
Jackson and Harris met in Sydney. They had not seen each other
for several years, both having left the district in which they
formerly resided.</p>

<p>"Jackson, you must come and stay with me for a while. I want
to introduce you to my wife. No! not the one I told you about She
it died, died from drink I believe. I heard she was dying, and
went to see her. If I had not seen it, I could not have believed
that a woman could alter so. I am not a hypocrite, Jackson, nor
are you, to I can say thank God she is dead without fear of your
pretending to be shocked. No! I can show you a wife I am proud
of."</p>

<p>Jackson stayed several days with Harris, whose wife certainly
merited her husband's praise. One evening the conversation turned
upon spirit rapping. Mrs. Harris remarked that some friends of
her's, who were devout believers in it, had pressed her strongly
to accompany them to a <i>seance</i> the next evening. She did
not at first mean to go, but on Harris and Jackson saying that
they would accompany her, they made up their minds to see the
wonder of spirit-land the next evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris' friends called at about three o'clock in the
afternoon, and the party, after proceeding down several rather
shabby streets, stopped at a more than rather shabby house.
Jackson whispered that he wondered the spirits did not select a
more fashionable, or at least cleaner, neighborhood to make their
communications in. After payment, they were shown into a
dimly-lighted room, where several other well dressed persons were
present. Some were seated round a table, others standing.</p>

<p>The medium and another person, who was not a medium at
present, only a disciple, were holding a conversation on
spirit-rapping for the good of the company. The medium was a
thin-faced, crafty-looking man, evidently in bad health. Not bad
looking, but still not exactly prepossessing. After a time, he
seated himself at the table, the disciple left the room, and
silence was demanded. The medium having explained the meaning of
the knocks, what one knock stood for, etc, put himself into
communication with the spirits. Several people asked questions of
deceased relatives, some trustingly and confiding, others
sneeringly. Sometimes the answers were strangely correct, to
judge from the countenances of the enquirers; others, and by far
the greater number, were evidently wrong.</p>

<p>Presently a conversation arose, which soon ended in a
discussion between believers and unbelievers. The medium then
took a pencil and paper, and stated that any of the company might
write a question on a piece of paper, fold it, and lay it on the
table; that his arm would be guided by the spirits to write the
answer, without having seen the question.</p>

<p>This was evidently the display of the evening, and the company
evinced a good deal of interest in the proceeding. As before,
some few of the answers seemed to be correct, and the majority
wrong. The spirits, to judge from the manner in which the medium
jerked his arm about, were fighting for possession of the
pen.</p>

<p>Harris and Jackson determined to ask a question out of fun.
Harris took out a note-book, wrote a question on a leaf, tore it
out, and then handed the book to Jackson. He took it, but did not
write anything. Harris walked up to the table and placed his
folded paper on it; at the same time looking half-laughingly,
half-enquiringly, into the face of the medium, immediately
afterwards though turning his gaze on to his wife. The medium's
sharp black eyes looked for a moment disconcerted, as they met
Harris' frank look, but they noted its after direction, and a
curious puzzled expression came into them.</p>

<p>The spirits at first did not seem inclined to answer the
question, but presently the mystic arm moved, and with a
doubtful, look, which soon changed into a triumphant one, the
seer handed the answer to Harris. It was a small piece of paper,
and there were only two words on it, but they were quite enough
to make Harris look at the medium with a scared face that was
quite, ludicrous; he drew back without speaking.</p>

<p>Jackson, who had been intently watching his friend's success,
wrote a question rapidly on a sheet of the note-book, tore it
out, folded it, strode forward, and laid it on the table. The
medium looked at Jackson, his lips moved, but no sound came. His
face grew very pale, and his gaze turned with a fixed look on the
folded paper; it deepened into such an expression of intense and
absolute horror as to startle the surrounding company. It was
evident to the most sceptical that there was no acting now. His
hand moved over the paper and formed a few hasty words, he folded
it, trembling as he did so, handed it to Jackson, and fell with a
deep groan on to the floor.</p>

<p>Jackson, nearly as startled and scared-looking as the
prostrate medium, put the paper into his pocket, and stooped over
the fallen man. The rest crowded round, the people of the house
were called, and they conveyed the pallid conjurer, now slowly
recovering from his swoon, out of the room.</p>

<p>The <i>seance</i> was broken up, and the company began to
disperse. Some expressed mat curiosity to see the answer which
had produced such a commotion. Jackson, however, did not satisfy
them. They looked for his question, but that and the former one
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Taken by the spirits," one devout believer suggested. In
reality quietly pocketed by Harris during the confusion
occasioned by the medium's collapse.</p>

<p>Harris, his wife, and Jackson, left their friends a short
distance from the spirit's residence and went home. Scarcely a
word passed between them on the way. Jackson appeared to be lost
in deep thought, The only remark he made:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see that fellow before, Harris?"</p>

<p>"Never that I know of," was the answer. Jackson was silent the
rest of the way.</p>

<p>When Jackson and Harris were alone in the room, Mrs. Harris
having gone upstairs to remove her bonnet, etc, Harris drew forth
the two questions, his own and Jackson's. He handed his to
Jackson. It was&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>If the spirit of my first wife is really present, let her
sign her name</i>."</p>

<p>"Here is the answer," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Mary Delaney</i>."</p>

<p>Jackson looked very scared and excited as he almost
whispered:</p>

<p>"Look at my question, then we will look at the answer."</p>

<p>Harris read&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Who was the murderer of James Starr</i>?"</p>

<p>Jackson opened the paper, the writing on which do one but the
unhappy seer had as yet seen. On it was written in a good, bold
hand, differing entirely from the writing on Harris'
paper&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Rudolph George Rawlings, known to you under the name of
Haughton</i>."</p>

<p>"It was him! I knew it!" exclaimed Jackson, in a voice which
brought Mm. Harris into the room in a fright.</p>

<p>"Who? Who?" cried Harris, nearly as excited as his friend.</p>

<p>"Haughton himself; I thought I knew him. No wonder he should
faint; he wrote and handed to me his own death warrant." Harris
still held the paper in his hand. "Look Jackson," he said, "it
is Starr's handwriting."</p>

<p>He went to a bookcase and took down a book, on the fly-leaf
was written "<i>T.C. Harris, from James Starr</i>." The
handwriting was identical.</p>

<p>"Let us go at once and get a warrant, and have him arrested,"
said Jackson, whose excitement could scarcely be controlled.</p>

<p>"We have no evidence to do so," replied Harris; "we are no
nearer towards doing justice on Starr's murderer than we were
before. This may carry conviction to you and me, but what
magistrate would issue a warrant on such a lame story? We can
inform the police that suspicious circumstances connect this
medium&mdash;who you may be sure is well known to them&mdash;with
the Haughton who was mixed up with Starr's murder. They may find
out some further evidence, but we are powerless."</p>

<p>A knock at the door. Mrs. Harris, who was listening with a
white face, went and opened it. The servant said that a woman
wanted most particularly to see Mr. Jackson. Harris looked at
him, then told the servant to show her up. She came in, a
faded-looking woman, who handed a slip of paper to Jackson. He
read on it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Come and see me before I die. R. Rawlings</i>."</p>

<p>He passed it over to Harris; his wife read it over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I will come with you," said Jackson to the woman.</p>

<p>"And so will I," said Harris.</p>

<p>She led them back to the house of the <i>seance</i>, to a room
with a miserable bed in it, wherein lay the man they had seen
acting the part of medium. He gazed wistfully at Jackson and
spoke very feebly, and in abrupt sentences.</p>

<p>"I am dying, but I will tell you how it was done."</p>

<p>The woman left the room, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"That night, which you remember as well as I, I went out on
the verandah to sleep. I did not go to sleep until long after you
all went to bed. I heard every word you said. I heard Harris tell
the story of his marriage, which enabled me to make the lucky
answer I did today. I knew you both directly you came in. I heard
Starr expose me about the cards in a contemptuous sort of way
that made me hate him. This led me on to recall your talk about
the gold. I determined to rob him, but I was a coward, and
assassinated him. I had not the courage even of a common
bushranger to stick him up. I knew the exact day he would be
back, as you knew. I feigned sickness the next morning, and only
went as far as the shepherd's hut. The next day I went on a short
distance past Harris' place and camped. That night after dark I
started back to Yorick's Lagoon.</p>

<p>"I meant to conceal myself behind the bushes growing on the
bank, and shoot him as he rode along the road, which, as you
know, is close to the lagoon. I reached the neighborhood of the
lagoon about daylight. My keeping off the road as much as
possible led to my coming in along the cattle track, on the side
of the lagoon opposite to the road. I had a short rifle in my
pack, the barrel taken off the stock, which was the reason you
did not notice it. I tied my horse up some distance off, and went
down the dusty cattle track to the water's edge on foot There I
waited the whole of the morning&mdash;how long it seemed! It was
about three o'clock when I saw Starr coming. I was about aiming
at him when he pulled up, got off and stooped down to drink. He
was right opposite to me, his horse drinking alongside of him,
his head down on the surface of the water. I was a dead shot, and
struck him right on the top of the head. He scarcely seemed to
move; his horse gave a slight start and snort, stretched his
neck, and snuffed once or twice at the body of its rider;
presently, finding itself free, began feeding, and after a few
minutes' nibbling at the grass, walked towards home.</p>

<p>"I was in doubt what to do, but determined to follow the horse
and obtain the valise. Should the gold not be in it, I would have
to return and search the body. During the latter part of my
watch, several mobs of cattle had come along the track I was
lying on, smelling me when they got close; they had run back
again. This gave me the idea of following the track back for a
couple of miles, trusting to the cattle to obliterate all marks
of my presence. Starr's horse seemed to be making straight home.
I determined to chance finding him somewhere along the road. I
followed the track out, took a circle round, and came on to the
road just as Starr's horse and some more he had picked up with
came along. He was quiet and easily caught The gold was in the
valise. The presence of the other horses prevented my track being
noticed, and by midnight I was back at my camp. At daylight I
looked along the road, and saw by the tracks that no one had
passed during my absence.</p>

<p>"I was safe. You know all about the inquest. I am ill of a
terrible disease which plagues me with fearful torments. I must
die in a day or two, perhaps to-night. Remorse now is useless,
but I tell you that I have known little peace since I shot Starr.
Leave me now, and don't attempt to preach to me."</p>

<p>Neither of the two friends felt either fitted or able to
attempt it, and seeing that their presence there availed nothing,
they left. But when they reached the foot of the stairs, Harris
called the woman, and, giving her money, told her to call and
inform him of the fate of Rawlings. She came next morning and
told them that he died a few hours after they left, never having
spoken again.</p>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>27. &mdash; JONSON'S FLEA-BITTEN GREY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 March 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
DO you remember that grey horse of Jonson's? <i>said Jim</i>.
Maybe it was not in your time; at any rate his was the only
ghost-horse I ever saw or spoke to. Moreover, he was a very
exceptional horse. In the first place he was said to be one
hundred years old. Now you know the average age of a horse I
suppose? This horse, this flea-bitten grey of Jonson's had just
succeeded to his hundredth birthday when Jonson came in to
possession of him.</p>

<p>Greys get flea bitten with age, and this horse was about the
worst flea-bitten horse you ever clapped your eyes on. In point
of fact, he need not have been called a grey at all, except as a
matter of courtesy, and you must be civil to a horse
occasionally. Now, as I stated before, when Jonson got this horse
he was just one hundred years old.</p>

<p>How do you know that? This way. Jonson's brother married Sally
Parsons; he was a man I never liked, because, although be was a
hard smoker, he never carried any matches with him. What has
Sally Parsons's husband to do with it? Come to think of it, I
don't know, I was only refreshing my memory a bit.</p>

<p>Jonson got the horse from his father, and his father got the
horse from his father, and as both of them each lived for fifty
years, that made 100, didn't it, when Jonson got the
horse&mdash;Anyhow, that's how he reckoned it.</p>

<p>When I knew Jonson he was boundary-riding, and, like these men
often do, he got gloomy and out of sorts; used to be always
talking to himself. Most of these fellows who live all alone get
queer that way. One day he came to me and said: 'Jim, what is the
best thing to do with that horse?'</p>

<p>'Keep him till he dies or sell him; his keep doesn't cost you
anything.'</p>

<p>'Now,' he replied, scarcely heeding me. 'I ask you, as a white
man, is it natural for a horse to live over 100 years. I tell you
it's preying upon me, and either that horse or myself must
succumb under the strain. Which is It to be?'</p>

<p>'Don't be a fool, Jonson,' I said. 'Go home and let the horse
be.'</p>

<p>He left me, remarking that there was bound to be trouble
between him and the horse soon, and I did not see anything more
of him for some time. About three weeks afterwards he came to me
again, and sat down by the fire; it was winter time.</p>

<p>'I had to do it,' he remarked, as he knocked his pipe out, 'I
tried all I knew to get that horse to talk, but it was no
good.'</p>

<p>'To get him to talk! Do horses generally talk, then?'</p>

<p>'No, not as a rule, but a horse 100 years old ought to be able
to. Just fancy all he could remember about the colony. Why he
would have made my fortune. Think I was going to lose that. Not
me.'</p>

<p>'So you killed him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it was necessary, there was nothing else to be
done.'</p>

<p>'Why necessary?'</p>

<p>'I keep telling you. That horse would not talk. He used to
grin at me, and try and express his ideas that way. But I
couldn't understand him. No, that horse mistook his vocation. He
was meant for a man.'</p>

<p>'Well, Jonson, you're simply a common-place kind of idiot. You
could have got a fiver for that horse, old as he was.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps I am. Never mind, that horse had to talk or die; and
he was obstinate&mdash;and died.'</p>

<p>Jonson got up, kicked my dog, and started home.</p>

<p>I knew what was the matter with him after I had meditated over
his case a bit. The ghost of his horse was haunting him, and
making things lively. Now listen, I love ghosts; they are
twelve-fig tobacco to me; so I thought I would go and camp with
Jonson for a few days, and find out what was really the matter.
Jonson had a dog, a bad dog in every day. He could eat strychnine
bait without a wink.</p>

<p>This dog and the flea-bitten grey had never been friends. The
dog considered the horse too old, and the horse thought the dog
too young. I have my suspicions that the dog prompted Jonson to
the killing of the horse, but I couldn't bring it home to him.
This dog was quite altered. He would constantly start and shiver,
and give little yelps and howls. Jonson used to kick him for it,
and when I found out the real cause I actually pitied the dog,
bad as he was.</p>

<p>The shade of that old horse used to come round and worry the
life out of that dog. He'd insist on his listening to his yarns,
and when the dog did not laugh in the right place, he'd suddenly
materialise himself, and kick the dog. The dog never had a
chance, for before he could get a bite in the horse was a ghost
again. One second he was a materialised horse, kicking a dog,
hard; the next he was a spectre, and it's no good biting a
spectre. What between, the materialised kicks outside and
Jonson's kicks inside, it was not a fair deal at all.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to interview this ghost and try and induce
him to stop his visits, for Jonson was getting decidedly loony.
So, one moonlight night I went outside about the time that Jonson
said the horse usually came. The ghost turned up to time, but for
a long time he would only grin at me, and go off into a horse
laugh. At last I asked him what the joke was.</p>

<p>'I'm laughing at that fool, Jonson,' he said. 'The ass thought
I was 100 years old when he killed me.'</p>

<p>'Well, everybody thought so,' I said, on behalf of Jonson.
'Didn't you belong to his grandfather?'</p>

<p>'Bah! I wasn't 20 when he killed me. Besides, Jonson never had
a grandfather.'</p>

<p>'But he must have had some sort of a grandfather,' I
suggested.</p>

<p>'Yes, if you put it that way, of course he had, but I don't
suppose he was anything to blow about, or that he ever owned a
horse in his life. But what do you want interfering here for? I'm
enjoying myself, which is more than I did when I was alive.'</p>

<p>'I tried my best to get Jonson to let you alone,' I replied.
'He was a bit off before, but if you keep this racket up I'm
quite sure he'll go clean cranky.'</p>

<p>'Serve him right; but can you suggest any other kind of
amusement?'</p>

<p>I thought for a bit, and then his kicking the dog put an idea
into my head. 'You could have had great fun on the road,' I said.
'You could materialise yourself and eat up the bread and sugar
and salt in the travellers' camps, and have all manner of high
jinks.'</p>

<p>'Never thought of it,' said the ghost. 'Tell Jonson I won't
worry him any more, but that I shall have an occasional kick at
that dog.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he gradually faded away.</p>

<p>I went back and told Jonson of my success. He was very
grateful; owned up that the ghost horse had been preying on his
nerves, and that he felt like a new man.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, the ungrateful brute turned dog on me in
the end.</p>

<p>I told you that Jonson's brother married Sally Parsons. I knew
she had something to do with the yarn, and this is where she
comes in. She and her husband were the first to see the horse.
They were driving home one night in a spring cart, and it was
bright moonlight. Jack Jonson had a drop or two in him, and he
suddenly saw two horses in front of him.</p>

<p>'Why, dash my buttons!' he said, 'I'm not so bad as all that.
Wake up, Sally!' for Sally was nodding.</p>

<p>Sally opened her eyes, but there was no horse there, and she
called him a drunken hog, and wished she'd never married him,
when she had plenty of better offers, and cried and went to sleep
once more. There was the horse again.</p>

<p>Jack Jonson rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>'Dash my buttons,' he said again, 'if it isn't Teddy's old
grey.'</p>

<p>As I say, he had a drop in him, and before that horse could
dematerialise himself he'd given him a stinging cut with the
whip. The old grey rattled his heels against the horse in the
shafts, and nearly knocked the whole caboodle over.</p>

<p>Sally woke up, and gave Jack a bit of her tongue for driving
over a stump, and they quarrelled all the way home, so much so,
that when Sally's baby was born, folks said it used to neigh
like a horse in its cradle.</p>

<p>This game continued, everybody driving along that, road on a
moonlight night would see two horses instead of one, or three
instead of two, as the case, might be. When they got home and
told the story to their wives they were accused of being mops and
brooms; and the whole of the married population in the district
were soon at loggerheads. How that wicked old ghost must have
chuckled.</p>

<p>Now, most of them recognised the spectral appearance as
Jonson's flea-bitten grey, and, in consequence, there was much
indignation against Jonson for killing the horse, which, as the
nuisance increased, came to a head, and a large number of people
interviewed Jonson, to inform him that he must either get rid of
the ghost or go himself.</p>

<p>Then it was that he played dog on me. He told them that it was
all my fault, and that I had invited the ghost of the old grey to
play these tricks, so they transferred their attentions to
me.</p>

<p>I did my best, I begged and entreated that old shade to give
up his tricks, but it was no use. He said he was enjoying
himself, and meant to keep it up; so I had to come away. I was
sorry, too, for it was a splendid district for ghosts. What
became of the dog? Oh, he died. Whether Jonson killed him or the
horse kicked him to death I don't know.</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>28. &mdash; THE DEAF COOK</h2>

<h3>A TRUE STORY</h3>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Goulburn Herald</i>, New South Wales, 3 August 1889</h3>

<p class="first">
THE ill-temper of cooks is proverbial, but for general
perverse crankiness the old-fashioned bush cook could be backed
at long odds against any or every class of workman. On a station
in the west of Queensland, then newly settled country, there was
a cook, who, in addition to possessing more than his share of bad
temper, was nearly as deaf as it was possible for man to be,
which added considerably to the standing annoyance and irritation
he was to everybody on the place.</p>

<p>However, men were not plentiful; he was undeniably a good
cook, clean and industrious, and all hands on the station did
their best to put up with his abominable tongue.</p>

<p>There was a boy of fourteen or fifteen engaged on the place,
who, possibly on account of the difference between youth and
crabbed age, was always in hot water with Jim the cook. The boy
had come to the station with a mob of store cattle, and being
smart and a light-weight, he had been kept on, and was rather a
favourite with everybody, the sole exception being the deaf
cook.</p>

<p>Even if Jim had been a man of good or genial temper, his
intense deafness would have been a source of aggravation to his
companions in the men's hut, but when he used his infirmity as
another weapon wherewith to annoy his fellow-men, matters were
made still more uncomfortable. Explanations were useless when a
row once commenced, as he affected never to hear them, and when
at last something was bellowed into his ear, would ask
indignantly what they were shouting for, as if he could not hear
plainly.</p>

<p>He was old and crippled, so nobody could well thrash sense
into him, and at last he was looked upon more and more as a
curiosity: a man with a moral warp in his nature, and a shingle
short, who was not altogether responsible for his actions.</p>

<p>The manager of the station&mdash;a good-natured
fellow&mdash;had taken a fancy to the boy Mat, as he was called,
and finding him intelligent, with hardly any education, made him
come up to him of an evening, and practise writing and reading, a
proceeding which still more increased the malignant dislike which
Jim felt for the boy.</p>

<p>Whitely, the manager, in conversation with his protg, drew
out his story, which was sufficiently commonplace. He belonged to
a country township in New South Wales, was the youngest of four,
had never seen his father, who he thought must have left his
mother when he was two or three years old. The boy always spoke
most affectionately of his mother, to whom he sent a considerable
portion of his earnings, and said that his brothers, who were at
bush work in different parts of the mother colony, did the same.
Great was the boy's pride at the improvement in his handwriting,
which was evinced by his addressing his own envelopes to his
home, instead of, as heretofore, asking Whitely to do it for
him.</p>

<p>One night the boy was sitting at the rough table with his arms
duly squared, and his paper pushed up close to the flickering,
sputtering slush-lamp, when Jim came to the table, and purposely
plumped his baking-dish of flour alongside him, so as to
discompose the lad.</p>

<p>Mat looked up at him and made some remark about the table
being big enough for both of them without disturbing him. Jim,
who could not hear what he said, guessed the purport, and
immediately returned:</p>

<p>"Ugh, you snivelling young beast; writing to your mammy, eh!
Here, send her some flour to make a cake for you," and he threw a
handful of flour over the letter which Mat had just been
regarding with such pride. In a second the boy jumped up, and
sent the slush-lamp full of hot fat into the cook's face.</p>

<p>Before Jim could retaliate the other two men in the hut
separated them, and both taking Mat's part, the cook had to rest
content with raving and cursing himself nearly into a fit, until
the men threatened seriously to run him out of the hut into the
waterhole if he didn't keep quiet.</p>

<p>It was summer-time on the great downs of the west, and the
next morning, before the sun had risen high enough to exert any
great heat, all hands on the station, with two exceptions, had
breakfasted and saddled up their horses preparatory to starting
out on a three-days' camp, a young "colonial experiencer," who
acted as storekeeper, and the deaf cook, being the only occupants
left to look after the place, as was the custom of those
days.</p>

<p>About mid-day on the third day, Mat came back with the two
pack-horses. He said that Mr. Whitely and the men would be home
some time that night, or early the next morning. The boy was
standing some short distance from the huts, unsaddling the
horses, the cook standing at the door of the kitchen, and the
young storekeeper, Peters, on the verandah of the larger of the
two buildings. Suddenly&mdash;as Peters, who told the story, said
afterwards&mdash;the whole air echoed with yells; and, as if by
magic, natives sprang up all around the place, and a shower of
spears came indiscriminately in amongst them all.</p>

<p>The horses bolted at once, and went careering across the
plain, distributing parts of the packs all over the place. Mat,
who was nearly knocked down by them, ran for the kitchen, but
before he got there the door was slammed and fastened, and he
beat vainly at it for admittance. The blacks were coming up fast,
and the poor boy turned them, still and drew his revolver and
fired at shouting to the cook to let him in.</p>

<p>Peters, who was a plucky young fellow, had got hold of a
double-barrelled shotgun, and fired with such good effect on the
advancing natives that he was able to keep them back, and run out
and help Mat into the hut where he and the manager lived.</p>

<p>Fortunately there were plenty of firearms and ammunition in
readiness, and during the next ten minutes things were made
pretty lively for the attacking party, the cook in the kitchen
making play with his revolver through the slabs. Mat had been
knocked about a little with waddies, but was not seriously
hurt.</p>

<p>Presently the blacks disappeared behind the kitchen, and as
the firing from there had ceased, it became evident that Jim's
ammunition had run out, and the natives now could come up safely
so long as they kept the kitchen between them and the hut. It was
not long before&mdash;watching and listening keenly as they were
for the chance of a shot&mdash;Peters and Mat heard the blacks
breaking into the kitchen from the back.</p>

<p>The two youngsters looked at each other and the same thought
must have been in the minds of both: Should they risk their lives
for the old brute who had deliberately fastened Mat out to take
his chance.</p>

<p>"No, by Jove, serve him well right," said Peters at last, as
if answering a query of his companion's.</p>

<p>Mat's voice was irresolute. "What will the others think if we
leave him, Mr. Peters?" he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, if we're alive to tell them, they'll say, 'Serve him
right, too,'" was the answer.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we have a try?" pleaded the boy, half opening the
door.</p>

<p>"Come on then," said Peters; "you go round one side, and I'll
go round the other."</p>

<p>They both started, but when they reached the opposite corners
of the kitchen they found they were too late; the blacks had
pulled out some of the slabs, and were dragging the deaf cook
out, beating him with their clubs whenever they got a chance.</p>

<p>The simultaneous discharge from the two corners startled them
so that they left their victim, and at the same moment some gins
in the background set up a shrill, wild jabbering, pointing
across the plain. In an instant the blacks fled, followed by
repeated shots from Peters and Mat.</p>

<p>Far away through the shimmering mirage the gins had caught
sight of the figures of approaching horsemen&mdash;Whitely and
his men returning sooner than they had expected. They were quite
ignorant of the state of affairs until they were close to the
station. On plain country sounds do not travel far, and at the
distance they were the blacks on foot could not be easily
discerned.</p>

<p>They found the two doing what they could for the wounded cook,
who had been sadly knocked about. A few hurried words explained
everything, and without dismounting Whitely and his men went off
in pursuit, for a lesson was necessary.</p>

<p>It was taught before sundown; there was a lagoon seven miles
from the station that for years afterwards was never used for
drinking purposes, by any human being, white or black.</p>

<p>The deaf cook's fate seemed very doubtful; during the night he
was delirious, and Peters volunteered to sit up with him; towards
morning however he spoke quite rationally, and, strangest thing
of all, his hearing was apparently restored to him. He answered
the questions Peters put to him without his having to raise his
voice at all.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by shutting young Hawkins out?" asked his
nurse, who was very sore on the subject.</p>

<p>"Young who?" said Jim.</p>

<p>"Mat," returned Peters. "Young hound," muttered the sick man;
"did the niggers get him?"</p>

<p>"No," was the indignant reply; "but only for him they'd have
got you, and I wish they had. I'm sorry I helped him."</p>

<p>"Hawkins! Mat! that's Matthew Hawkins," repeated the cook
unheedingly. "I never heard his name before."</p>

<p>"Suppose not; you've always been, or pretended to be, stone
deaf."</p>

<p>The wounded man put his hand up to his head in a dazed way,
and at last said to Peters, "he came up with the cattle from
Walringar, and he's got a mother there, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Peters.</p>

<p>The deaf cook gave a loud cry, turned his face to the wall,
and beat wildly with his hands against the slabs, unheeding the
rough splinters that pierced his flesh. Peters caught his wrist,
thinking he was growing delirious again.</p>

<p>Jim started up in the bunk, gazed at him with horror-struck
look, and, with an unearthly laugh, cried out, "why, he must be
my son, and that's where I left his mother years ago!"</p>

<p>The next moment he fell back dead.</p>

<p>To the relief of Peters, Whitely, who had been awakened by
their voices, came in to see what the matter was, and to him
Peters told the strange tale.</p>

<p>After investigation proved that it was quite true. The man's
temper, aggravated by his infirmity, led to his quarrelling with
and leaving his wife and children. His deafness prevented his
ever hearing Mat's surname, which was rarely used, and he was
within an ace of causing the death of his own son at the hands of
the blacks, for there could be no doubt that his fiendish temper
had prompted him to leave Mat outside at the mercy of the
natives.</p>

<p>Peters was exceedingly thankful that he had acceded to the
attempted rescue, as the poor boy had now nothing to reproach
himself with, with the exception of throwing the fat-lamp at his
unknown parent. The blacks had evidently been watching the place
for some time, and only for Mat's return would have caught the
two occupants quite off their guard, as they would have probably
been lying down reading or dozing.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a lucky thing for the hero of the yarn, for
fortune seemed to stick to him from that time, and he is now one
of the few men who have been successful in settling new country,
and the general verdict is that he deserves it.</p>

OF GEORGE VALLANCE</h2>

<h3>Reprinted in the <i>Evening News</i>, 15 December 1900, as

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="first">
ON the 26th of last January I left Toowoomba by the early
train. In the compartment in which I was seated there was only
one other passenger&mdash;an apparently elderly man, with gray
hair and beard, and wearing blue spectacles. Now I take great
interest in the scientific questions that of late years have been
agitating the learned and theological circles of the Old World;
and am always glad to meet anybody who is open to a little
discussion on the merits of the different theories. My
fellow-traveller somehow impressed me with the idea that he was
such a one. Hoping, therefore, to beguile the tedium of the
journey to Brisbane with a little instructive argument, I made a
few remarks on the ordinary topics of the day. He answered me in
grave quiet tones that seemed to betoken that he possessed the
inclinations I gave him credit for.</p>

<p>"By-the-by," I said, plunging at once into the middle of my
subject, "Do you believe in the proteinaceousness of all forms of
protoplasm?"</p>

<p>He gave an unaffected start of dismay, and gazed curiously at
me through his spectacles.</p>

<p>"I have not studied the subject sufficiently to give you a
decided answer," he said at last in a slightly constrained tone,
"but am rather inclined to take that view of the case."</p>

<p>"There I differ with you," I said eagerly. "Now take for
instance the effect produced by the action of galvanism as
applied to producing contraction of the component parts of the
fundamental substance. The very same effect can be produced upon
matter which contains only two of the elements common to both;
and chemical analysis as applied to the living subject."</p>

<p>"No you don't!" he cried, starting up and showing himself to
be a tall athletic man, much younger than I had supposed. "Not
alive! I defy you!"</p>

<p>"My dear sir," I stammered, "you must have completely
misunderstood me."</p>

<p>"I don't misunderstand you. You have tracked me down,
but"&mdash;and he seized me by the shoulder&mdash;"you'll never
live to boast of it. I'm going to throw you out of the door!"</p>

<p>We were half way down the range when he uttered this threat,
just crossing a viaduct, with the tops of tall gum trees far
below us.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to murder me?" I gasped, horror-stricken, for I
felt helpless in his strong hands.</p>

<p>"Self-defence," he replied coolly, as he opened the door; "you
are an agent of Allcut's, and, as such, deserve no mercy at my
hands."</p>

<p>"Allcut!" I cried; "never heard of the man before, and have no
more evil design against you 'than a helpless monad."</p>

<p>He seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>"I may be mistaken," he said; "I should not like to kill you
without reason, but I scarcely know whether to let you off or
not."</p>

<p>After blinking at me doubtingly, as if still debating the
feasibility of throwing me into the next gully we crossed,
he&mdash;to my great relief&mdash;closed the door, released my
shoulder, and sat down.</p>

<p>"I owe you an apology for my behaviour just now," he said
after a pause, during which he scrutinised me narrowly. "I
believe I was hasty; but your words were suspicious, as you would
admit if you knew all."</p>

<p>I mumbled something about its not being of any consequence,
although I still felt the effects of his grip on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," he went on, "if I'm found by certain
people my life will not be worth much, and naturally I am a
little suspicious."</p>

<p>I thought that throwing a man off a railway train was a little
hasty, but said nothing, as we just then plunged into a tunnel.
When we were in the middle of it, and in total darkness, my
companion laid his hand on my arm, and shouted in my ear:</p>

<p>"Properly speaking, I am a dead man!"</p>

<p>"Don't joke about such things," I said nervously, as I thought
what a nice situation I was in, shut up with a lunatic seemingly.
"Pooh! I don t mean that I'm a ghost, but by rights I ought to
be."</p>

<p>"Unless yon are a little more explicit," I said, "I am afraid
I cannot quite follow you."</p>

<p>"Will you swear not to reveal to any man for at least a
fortnight what I am going to tell you? By the end of that time I
shall be well out of harm's way."</p>

<p>"I will readily promise that."</p>

<p>"It's a long story, so don't grumble if you get bored."</p>

<p>The adventure that he then related to me I found so remarkable
that I requested him to allow me to take notes of it as he
proceeded. I do not therefore profess that I heard it in the same
unbroken manner in which it is given here, but in substance it is
the same.</p>

<h3>THE STRANGE ADVENTURE: PART 1</h3>

<p>NEVER mind how I came to be reduced to the state of poverty in
which New Year's day of 1869 found me, but poor I was, and as
destitute as man could be. I had neither money, nor home, nor
clothes worth speaking of. Cold, hungry, and houseless in London
during a bitterly hard winter, that was my then condition. Of
course I was gazing into a cookshop like the typical starving man
of fiction; and if this portion of my story seems rather
stereotyped I cannot help it; it is perfectly true.</p>

<p>"What a splendid physical development!" said a voice behind
me; "that is to say, if properly filled out. Allow me;" and the
speaker extended a gloved hand, and pinched my scantily-clothed
ribs in a critical manner. I turned round prepared to strike him,
for I did not believe in such a liberty; but he said hastily: "No
offence meant; pray pardon me, I mean you nothing but well."</p>

<p>I surlily damned him and his meaning too, and was moving away,
when he followed, and passed his arm under mine. He was dressed
in a fur-lined overcoat with the high collar turned up above his
ears; a round fur cap such as they wear in Germany was upon his
head; and all I could see of his face was a well-shaped aquiline
nose, and bright gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Now pocket your pride, and answer my questions," this cool
stranger said. "Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I can't deny it."</p>

<p>"Very hungry?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Had nothing to eat all day."</p>

<p>"Are you cold?"</p>

<p>"I look warm?" I asked ironically.</p>

<p>"Homeless?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And about the future?"</p>

<p>I jerked my arm away indignantly. "What business is it of
yours. Hang myself, drown myself, or starve I suppose."</p>

<p>"Will you come home with me to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; go with the devil if he asked me."</p>

<p>My companion without another word hailed a passing hansom, and
we got in and drove away. We stopped at a large house in
Malison-street, and, passing through double doors, I found myself
in a warm lighted hall. My new friend or patron&mdash;I may as
well mention his name&mdash;Professor Allcut&mdash;told a servant
to take me to a room, and furnish me with clothes. When I entered
the dressing-room I stood for a moment or two surveying my figure
in the glass and grimly contrasting it with the luxurious
surroundings.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards I looked into the same glass, and could
hardly persuade myself that it was the same figure I saw imaged
there. My disordered and neglected hair and whiskers had been
brought into order again by an accomplished valet, and my clothes
fitted to perfection. The gaunt ruffian who entered the room was
now&mdash;I flattered myself&mdash;a rather striking looking
gentleman. I followed the servant downstairs, and was ushered
into a drawing-room where I found Allcut in evening dress; a gray
haired man whose name was Dr. Irving; and two young and
remarkably handsome girls, whose names I need not mention.</p>

<p>Allcut introduced me to the others; and I was received with a
cordiality that was perhaps a trifle overdone. We soon went to
dinner, and to a man suddenly brought from hunger and desolation,
and placed in the situation I now found myself in, I need
scarcely say that everything acquired a double zest and flavor.
The dinner was excellent, the wines still better, and the company
best of all. Perhaps the manner of the two girls had not quite
sufficient of the reserve that "stamps the class of Vera de
Vere;" but I was in no mood for criticism, and by the time the
ladies left my late life seemed only a troubled nightmare.</p>

<p>We did not sit long, and I presently found myself installed
upon a couch next to one of my fair friends, the other playing a
low sweet sonata upon the piano. Almost directly we reached the
drawing-room, Allcut begged me to excuse Irving and him for a
short time, and I was left alone, and in perilous company. The
soft dreamy music; the unaccustomed influence of the wine and
dinner; the warm odorous atmosphere of the room; and the close
proximity of my two beautiful companions&mdash;for the couch was
drawn up cozily near to the piano&mdash;lulled me into a state of
ecstatic satisfaction with my lot that was simply beatitude. What
we talked about, I scarcely remember; my neighbor at the piano
occasionally throwing a sprightly remark into the rippling stream
of conversation I was carrying on with the other fair one, and
laughing in a tone as silvery as the music itself.</p>

<p>Quite an hour must have quickly glided away, when Allcut
re-entered and came and joined in the gay badinage we were
carrying on. Presently the girls moved away to the further end of
the room and he took the vacated place beside me.</p>

<p>"Life can be made very pleasant, can it not?" he asked with a
meaning smile. I assented moat emphatically. "And life&mdash;a
life such as you were living can be nothing but a prolonged
torture?"</p>

<p>Again my assent was undoubted.</p>

<p>"Which then is the best? A few years of enjoyment, with every
wish bearing fruition, every desire fulfilled, and every dream
realised with wealth to carry out schemes of benevolence and good
towards our fellow-men, to further the ends of science, and buy
the beautiful surroundings that gratify an innate love of
art&mdash;to have young and lovely companions of the other sex to
soothe with their presence, and in their caresses to forget the
past, or to remember it only sufficiently to make its memory lend
an added charm to the enjoyment of the present would not such
life, terminated by a death of glorious self-sacrifice, be better
than many weary years spent in fighting cold and hunger, and the
desolate horror of feeling yourself outcast and exiled from your
proper sphere. Weary years to linger through without hope or
solace, and at last to die, like&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pointed forward as he uttered the last words; and as by
enchantment the room and its voluptuous fittings disappeared, and
I was gazing once more on the bleak deserted street. The pavement
was encrusted with half-thawed discolored snow, and the drizzly
winter sleet beat upon a wretched form that crouched shivering
and moaning in a doorway. I recognised my own image. Aye, so real
was it that it seemed as though I could feel the bitter raw wind
racking my aching bones as I drew my soaked rags around my
starved and emaciated body&mdash;could feel the piercing cold
striking its relentless dreadful fangs deeper and deeper into my
cowering shrinking frame&mdash;experienced in my own person all
the unutterable agony of a protracted death from cold and hunger;
even as I watched the apparition of myself fall forward with a
feeble moan, and lie on the hard pavement, free at last from all
the ills that torture the wretched of this world&mdash;freed by
the blessed angel of Death.</p>

<p>Then the vision was gone. I was once more in the room, and oh
either side of me, bending down and looking tenderly and
enquiringly into my face, were the two girls. Allcut was standing
a few paces in front, and he spoke again in his deep rich
voice:</p>

<p>"You have your choice. I can give you life: a life such as you
are now enjoying, for a few years, and after that&mdash;death!
Or you can go forth again into the streets and linger
on&mdash;perhaps for but a few months; perhaps for double the
number of years you might have spent happily here, and
then&mdash;" He waved his hand towards the spot where I had seen
the late apparition. As he concluded, one of the girls sank down
on the couch beside me, and, resting her soft shapely hand on my
shoulder, glanced with lustrous eyes over the delicate down
fringe of the fan with which she coquettishly concealed the lower
part of her face.</p>

<p>"Stay with me," she murmured, bending nearer. "Stay with me,"
echoed the other as she struck a few melodious chords upon the
piano, and sang in her seductive voice the following words. The
two joining in the last line of each verse.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Seeks not the wearied bird refuge and cover?<br>

Hastes not the stag to the sheltering tree?<br>

Turns not the maid to the arras of her lover?<br>

Then why do you <i>doubt us</i>? O stay, love, with me!</p>

<p class="verse">
Dreamily, happily, hall we the morrow here;<br>

No frown on our features you ever shall see.<br>

No shadow of trouble; no want, and no sorrow here;<br>

Why do you doubt us? O stay, love, with me!</p>


<p><br>
The dying cadence of their blended voices put me past all
consideration; even if any such would have stayed me.</p>

<p>"My choice is made," I cried; "I stay!"</p>

<p>"Then follow me," replied Allcut. I turned regretfully from
the delightful smiles of the two syrens, and followed him into
another room&mdash;a library, where Irving was seated at a
table.</p>

<p>"He consents," said Allcut as we entered.</p>

<p>"Let me congratulate you upon your determination," replied
Irving, rising and addressing me.</p>

<p>"Will you explain the nature of the services we require from
Mr. Vallance?" said Allcut as we seated ourselves.</p>

<p>"You must know," began Irving, who remained standing, "that
for years my friend and I have devoted ourselves to the solution
of the greatest problem that can occupy the human understanding.
Need I say that it is the origin of life? Sometimes we have held
the secret apparently in view, but it has ever eluded us; and we
are still toiling steadily on hoping for the dawning of light.
Some of our greatest scientific truths have been learnt by the
aid of vivisection. And&mdash;as perhaps you know&mdash;in
plants, and the lowest order of apparently inanimate things, a
motive power of life has been proved to exist Could we assimilate
these particles of protoplasm with the microscopic germs of
existence contained in the blood, and distributed throughout the
body of living man, we should have picked the lock that has
defied thousands of generations to open&mdash;have established
truth, great, unassailable, Truth, upon an everlasting foundation;
have shattered at one blow the creeds and superstitions that
have enslaved men since the beginning; have elevated ourselves,
and you with us, into immortality. You, the heroic victim. We,
the pure philosophers who look indifferently upon pain and
suffering when they lead to light. We offer you five years of
uninterrupted worldly enjoyment We offer you every pleasure that
humanity values or that money can command. And in return we
ask&mdash;your life. At the expiration of the lustrum, on a
specified date, we require that you place your living body at our
disposal. If again driven forth into the streets, you will
probably die before five years have passed."</p>

<p>"And if I agree," I asked, "what death do you purpose that I
shall die when my day of forfeit comes?"</p>

<p>"I have said before&mdash;and I in no way wish or seek to hide
our purpose from you&mdash;that vivisection has lent marvellous
aids to science. That is the process we intend to employ upon
you."</p>

<p>"How long will this process last? I mean how long will you
take killing me?"</p>

<p>"We cannot say. No unnecessary pain will be inflicted; but it
would militate greatly against the success and accuracy of our
observations were we to deaden your sense of pain with narcotics
daring the progress of our operations. What we require is a human
body of fine physical organism, mentally cultivated, and in the
prime of life. In fact a good type of the highest form of life.
During the intermittent periods of tranquil observations that may
occur whilst the experiments are in force, you will be supplied
with every stimulating nourishment known to science, and be
carefully tended."</p>

<p>"Then I may be days dying?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you will be. The minute microscopic observations
that we intend to make upon the action of the internal organs of
generation during life will occupy a day or two. We must not
trust to induction for gaining our final knowledge; every step
must be proved with undoubted accuracy before the next is taken.
The crowning secret that will repay all our long labors we hope
to learn during your expiring moments. And the hour of your death
will be the date of the birth of true physiology. I have stated
the case without going into scientific particulars, which would
not enlighten you any more, as doubtless you have not studied the
subject. We await your answer."</p>

<p>I was staggered. Away from the unreal atmosphere of the room I
had just quitted, and here, before these grave unbending men, the
proposition assumed a far more serious hue.</p>

<p>"I need not say," put in Allcut as I pondered, "that if
posthumous fame is dear to you it will be yours. And what fame
will equal that awaiting us&mdash;the three discoverers of the
source of human existence, the foundation of life?"</p>

<p>I thought and thought. Many men endured quite as much pain so
I probably should have to suffer, and bore it unflinchingly.
Again, I might die before the allotted time expired. I turned the
proposal over and over in my mind, and&mdash;consented.</p>

<p>"Now," said Allcut, "this is the understanding between us: If
before the expiration of the five years you attempt to escape
from us, or to commit suicide, and fail, we are at liberty to at
once put our experiment in force. This is the penalty you must
agree to pay for any effort to evade your obligations. For the
rest, you will receive 15,000 to 20,000 yearly income during
the specified term, and this house is at your disposal, with the
exception of the laboratories. I will write out a simple
memorandum of our agreement, which we will all three sign; a mere
matter of form, as we could not of course enforce it
legally."</p>

<p>He wrote; they both signed; I added my signature, and sold
myself for 15,000 a year for five years.</p>

<p>"Now may I ask," I said, "how it is that, having all this
power and wealth at your disposal, you do not procure by force
the subject for your experiment, instead of paying such an
exorbitant sum for it?"</p>

<p>"It would be murder, which is totally repugnant to our
feelings, although you may not believe me when I say so."</p>

<p>"On the other hand," remarked Irving, "if we tempted some
dying patient from the hospital to sell to us his few remaining
hours of existence it would not aid us much. We want&mdash;as I
think I told you&mdash;a type, an average type that is, of the
highest form of human life. Yon are so physically; we can see
that at a glance. And that you are up to the mental average we
discovered during dinner."</p>

<p>"What prevents me from applying to the police for protection
when the time draws near?"</p>

<p>"It would be to our advantage if you did, as your life would
be forfeited at once by the terms of the bond you have signed. No
power you could marshal against us could save you. You would go
to a police-magistrate with this tale; be laughed at, or
arrested on suspicion of being a lunatic at large, and would be
back in our power very shortly. Try it!"</p>

<p>"One more question: The vision of my possible death that you
showed me just now&mdash;was it effected by natural means?"</p>

<p>"Of course; what other means are there? A mere mechanical
illusion, produced with the assistance of some new discoveries in
photography. You did not think, whilst posturing before your
glass, that your likeness was being taken. Now shall we rejoin
the ladies?"</p>

<p>We did so; and in half-an-hour I had quite forgotten my
strange agreement.</p>

<h3>THE STRANGE ADVENTURE: PART 2</h3>

<p class="first">
OF the events of the three years that followed my strange
agreement suffice is to say that I crammed as much excitement and
dissipation into them as I possibly could. And when this began to
pall I fell into a fit of gloomy despondency that made me
suddenly shun all society, break up my other establishments, and
retire to the house in Malison-street I thought of nothing else
but my approaching end, and how I could best avoid it. My dread
of my two purchasers was so great that I feared making the
slightest false step lest it should be a signal to them to claim
the fulfilment of the bond.</p>

<p>I had soon found out that their boast was true. My every
movement was known, and could have been checked at any time. It
had been one of the terms of my agreement that I was not to
communicate what had passed to anybody, and thus I was debarred
from seeking a confederate to aid me in escaping from my doom. I
tried to ingratiate myself with my bondmasters, and to take an
interest in their pursuits and studies.</p>

<p>I soon saw, however, that nothing would be gained by that
move: they were both as steeled against human feelings or
affections as if they had been inhabitants of the stars. Then I
took a morbid and sickly interest in attending anatomical
lectures and obtaining admission to the hospitals to witness
surgical operations. And so time sped on to the day of fulfilment
I saw no hope of escape save in suicide, and that I kept for a
last resource. And I was so well watched that I believe I could
not have successfully accomplished that.</p>

<p><br>
ABOUT a month before the bill drawn on my life was due, I was
sauntering moodily about the Park, when I saw before me a man
whose appearance suggested an idea that promised to elaborate
into something. He was evidently a poor devil of the Beau Tibbs
breed who spent his little all in buying cheap fashionable
clothes, and airing them upon his back, to the robbery of his
stomach. I did not doubt that he knew me, as my three years
career in the fastest of fast life would have made me a marked
man; especially with fellows of his stamp, who would consider it
indispensable to be able to recognise temporary lions. I
therefore deemed there would be no difficulty in making his
acquaintance; and, after a turn or two in order to think out the
plan that was beginning to assume shape in my brain, I went up
and accosted him.</p>

<p>As I expected, he was evidently beside himself with
gratification at my notice, and we walked up and down two or
three times discussing current topics of the time. I did not push
my acquaintance too openly at first, but after meeting him once
or twice more asked him to dinner at an hotel, and in fact played
much the same part with him that Allcut had formerly acted with
me. Only I carefully avoided taking him to Malison-street; and
took rooms at an hotel in order to work out my scheme. I knew I
was watched, but I did not care for emissaries, as long as Irving
and Allcut did not personally supervise my proceedings.</p>

<p>My new friend's name was Kingley, and of all the selfish
vulgar brutes I ever met he was the worst. All the better for my
purpose. Such an event as the close acquaintanceship of a rich
man had never occurred to him before, and he was evidently
determined to make the most of it; his absurd self-conceit
leading him to suppose that I was attracted by the social talents
he professed to possess.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, Kingley," I said one day after dinner as he
reclined smoking such a cigar as he could only have dreamt of
before, "I wonder a fellow like you never got married&mdash;a
girl with money, of course, I mean."</p>

<p>"Well, I have had one or two chances of that sort but couldn't
quite make up my mind; and now I'm rather sorry I let them slip;
mightn't get another."</p>

<p>"Really, apart from flattery, old fellow, a man with your
appearance should not say that."</p>

<p>"Oh, if the opportunity showed I could profit by it; but the
opportunity, as the devil said, that's all I want."</p>

<p>"Now I've been having that opportunity thrust down my throat
for the last six months, and would give as much to avoid it as
you would to meet it."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the way of things; you don't want money, and it's
offered to you."</p>

<p>"And supposing it were offered to you, what would you do?"</p>

<p>"Jump at it, my boy, like a bird."</p>

<p>"You see, I am in a fix altogether. It's an old family affair,
and until the last few months I was quite willing to carry out
the arrangement; but latterly I've met somebody else,
and&mdash;you understand."</p>

<p>"Yes; spoony in another quarter. Well, tell the parents or
guardians you won't."</p>

<p>"What excuse can I make after agreeing to everything and
having all the necessary documents drawn out: besides the lady
herself is to be considered in the matter, remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, the girl's nothing," said the brute; "hang her, she'll
get over it."</p>

<p>"Now I've a good idea but I can't carry it out alone; I want
your assistance."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Come here," I said, and I took him into my bed-room; we
stopped before the glass.</p>

<p>"What do you see?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Two devilish good-looking fellows," he replied.</p>

<p>I took a hair-brush and brushed my hair in the same manner as
my companion's.</p>

<p>"By gad," he said; "we are alike, there's no two ways about
it."</p>

<p>"Do you guess my idea now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not altogether."</p>

<p>"Take my place."</p>

<p>"And be married instead of you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Good looking?"</p>

<p>"As you'd see in a day's walk."</p>

<p>"Done with you, I say."</p>

<p>We went back to our cigars. And I proceeded to unfold my views
to my companion:</p>

<p>"Of course you will be married in my name, but that's
nothing&mdash;you are or will be just as much married as if you
had been married in your own: but to avoid all chance of
detection you must not substitute yourself for me until the last
moment, and the intervening time you can profitably employ in
practising a good imitation of my voice and manner."</p>

<p>"And you think I can carry it off all right?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it; besides you will lose nothing if you fail,
and are detected; I shall be the sufferer."</p>

<p>"And when is the marriage to come off?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow fortnight."</p>

<p>"So soon? no wonder you were ready for a desperate game. Now
confess," he said with more cunning than I gave him credit for;
"was it not with this idea in your head that you made my
acquaintance first?"</p>

<p>"Well, I admit that it was, but you can't grumble at that when
it brings you a rich wife and a pretty one."</p>

<p>"Not I, old fellow; it's a deuced lucky likeness for me."</p>

<p>We parted for the time. He went away doubtless to imitate my
gait, gestures, etc, before a glass; I to ponder over the more
difficult step that lay ahead of me&mdash;namely, introducing
Kingley into the house in Malison-street without the knowledge of
Irving or Allcut. I thought of many ways before a feasible plan
began to be shaped in my brain.</p>

<p>At last I hit upon one. I told Kingley that we must not be
seen together any more; that I would explain his course to him,
and then we need not meet again. This would not excite suspicion.
I drew out a plan of the house in Malison-street, and made him
perfect himself in it, as a mistake would be fatal. He was as
anxious to succeed as I was, having such a prize in view, and in
a short time he was proficient, and I felt sure could be depended
on. In fact all he had to do was to enter the house at a certain
hour, and walk up to my bed-room, decline all attendance, and go
to bed.</p>

<p>I posted him up in his proper conduct during the approaching
marriage, but this was only to deceive him; I, of course, knew he
would never require it. If Irving and Allcut thought they had me
safely in the house, the vigilance outside would be relaxed and I
might escape; the worst that could happen to my friend would be a
good fright, and the disappointment of not getting his bride. And
meanwhile I should be across the Channel. I had taken care,
having saved most of my income during the last two years, to
forward sums of money to different parts of the world in the hope
that I might be able to escape. Certainly I felt that I had
robbed the two philosophers of 100,000 or so should I escape;
but life! what will not a man do for that?</p>

<p>I next procured a bottle of laudanum and with a great show of
secrecy conveyed it to my room. I guessed what would be the
result: the contents were changed and an innocent sleeping
draught substituted.</p>

<p>Now came the critical day. The next morning at 6 o'clock I
was&mdash;so said the bond&mdash;to deliver over my body to its
purchasers. Allcut met me about 8 o'clock as I was descending the
stairs.</p>

<p>"To-morrow at 6, Mr. Vallance," he said, "we shall require you
to fulfil your part of the agreement."</p>

<p>I muttered a fierce oath, that only made him smile; it was
what he expected from me. Then, as if a sudden thought had struck
me, I turned and rejoined him.</p>

<p>"I'll dine with you to-night," I said.</p>

<p>He looked curiously at me, evidently puzzled, but merely said
he, should be most happy; and we joined Irving in the
dining-room. My arrangement with Kingley was that at eleven
o'clock he should meet me at an appointed place in a hansom cab,
and we would both drive around for about ten minutes; then up to
the house in Malison-street, where he would descend and bid me
good-night, taking care to show himself well. He would enter, and
I would drive away. I had put on one or two marked articles of
dress of which he had the duplicates, and I trusted to this, and
the resemblance between us, to shifting the spies that followed
me on to his track, and giving me six or seven hours start.</p>

<p>I think I forgot to tell you that one of the conditions of my
agreement was that I was not to leave England. Of course I would
remain in the cab, and intended to cut off my moustache and
whiskers, with a sharp pair of scissors I would take for the
purpose, during the preliminary drive.</p>

<p>I saw Kingley about 10 o'clock in the morning, and he had
seemed very nervous as the time approached; he also appeared to
have been having recourse to stimulants in order to keep his
courage up. Dreading that he might call one of the servants to
get him some brandy, after he got into the house, I told him he
would find a capital pick-me-up in my room labelled "Laudanum." I
was certain that an innocuous soporific had replaced the poison,
and a dose of it would keep him quiet until morning.</p>

<p>May I never eat such another dinner as that one I ate with my
two purchasers that night. And yet they were cordiality itself.
They evidently thought that I intended suicide; and so I did if
all else failed, but not in the way they thought. In my pocket
was a small revolver, and the first ball out of it was intended
for Allcut, if I got the chance.</p>

<p>Thus we dined, I knowing that my life was forfeit on the
morrow; that the well-trained servant behind me ministering to my
wants was watching every movement I made; that gold had
surrounded me with spies so that I could not move or speak
without the motion being noted; and that to escape this net woven
around me I had to depend on a very clumsy manoeuvre, assisted by
a still more clumsy confederate.</p>

<p>Now that the time had arrived for its performance, my
stratagem appeared a most flimsy one, doubtless already seen
through and laughed at: surely the sharp-sighted spies had
already noted the likeness between Kingley and me, and guessed
what my motive was in cultivating his acquaintanceship. Win or
lose, I must stand by it now.</p>

<p>Slowly the time crept on. At 10 o'clock, unable to control
myself, I left the room, and went down stairs to walk up and down
the street; anything to dull the sense of anxious expectancy I
was in.</p>

<p>At the head of the first flight of stairs leading from the
entrance hall a green baize door had been put up, to deaden all
sound from the lower part of the house. From the landing where
this was, a descent of about half-a-dozen steps led to the
laboratory, a detached-building erected by the two physiologists
after they purchased the house. As I put my foot on the landing
the green baize door opened, and my double appeared, intoxicated
evidently.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow," he said; "a little before my time, but I
suppose it's all right."</p>

<p>Behind me was Allcut's most trusted servant, witnessing this
fatal denouement. I need scarcely say that I felt that all was
lost.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you all the same," I said as a desperate resolve
crossed my mind; "go up to my room; it's all right; make yourself
at home."</p>

<p>"Make myself at home," he repeated as he went on; "So I will
if I don't lose myself."</p>

<p>"Open the door," I said carelessly to the servant.</p>

<p>The fool did so, or was about to do so, but as he necessarily
turned partly away to do it he gave me the opportunity I wanted.
My pistol shooting was perfection at close quarters, and I had
studied anatomy to some purpose: he fell on the floor shot
through the heart, without uttering more than a gasping sob.
Seizing him by the arms I dragged his body down the laboratory
stairs, and then listened. The beautifully fitted baize door
prevented the report being heard downstairs, where most if not
all the servants then were.</p>

<p>But what would be the result in the dining-room where I had
left Allcut and Irving? Kingley had kept on; I heard the
dining-room door open and Allcut's voice speaking to him. Thank
goodness, he had sufficient sense left to push surlily past, and
make for the bed-room; I could distinguish that much. Next moment
two of the servants ascended the stairs, evidently summoned by a
bell, which I could not hear on account of the baize door. One
came down again; the other no doubt was watching at my bed-room
door, where I was then supposed to be. The report, which was not
a loud one, had been heard in the dining-room, but Allcut, seeing
me as he thought re-ascending, did not trouble himself any more
about it, beyond letting a double watch upon me in my
bedroom.</p>

<p>But how was I to get away? There was only one mode of egress
beyond the ordinary one by the hall door&mdash;namely, through
the conservatory; but it was impossible for me to reach that
without being seen. The servant who admitted Kingley must have
imagined that I had gone out that way, which accounted for his
unquestioned entrance. If I went out by the door I should be
watched and tracked down; I was in a complete fix. Meanwhile the
body at my feet must be disposed of. I tried the laboratory door;
it was open. I took the corpse in and carried it to a case
wherein a skeleton had formerly been kept; before it hung a
curtain, but the tenant had been sent to a museum.</p>

<p>Fortunately the victim of misplaced confidence had bean lying
on a thick door mat, which had soaked up all the blood; this I
also put in the case, which resembled a wardrobe with a curtain
instead of a door. Hearing voices approaching, my only resource
was to get in myself as well, it being the only place of
concealment the room afforded. Irving and Allcut entered; I
watched through a slight rent in the curtain, revolver in
hand.</p>

<p>"Where is Hall, I wonder?" said Allcut. I was sitting on
him&mdash;Hall was the man I had shot.</p>

<p>"I told him he might go off duty to-night," said Irving.
"Brown and Williams are upstairs."</p>

<p>They entered into chemical experiments which were doubtless
interesting and instructive, but which I, sitting on a dead body
in a most uncomfortable position, did not appreciate. I could not
at first make up my mind as to a course of action, whether to
emerge from my place of concealment and run the risk of a fight,
or remain quietly and await the course of events; eventually I
decided on the latter. The two physiologists remained in the
laboratory all night; they were evidently preparing for their
crowning experiment upon my living body.</p>

<p>Six o'clock struck, the hour of doom; and five minutes
afterwards the two servants entered bringing in the inanimate
form of Kingley. He had taken the sleeping draught, and, coming
as it did on the top of the spirits he had swallowed, it had
rendered him completely insensible. This was a result I had not
calculated upon; what was I to do? Remain quiet and await the
result of circumstances; nothing like it.</p>

<p>The two servants divested Kingley of his clothes, and placed
him, face downwards, upon a marble slab in the middle of the
room. Iron clamps were fixed on it, so as to render it impossible
for the sufferer to move when once they were secured. One passed
round each ankle; one round the back of each knee, round his
waist, round his neck, and around each wrist. Having fastened him
down the two servants left the room. Then Irving and Allcut
approached. Irving drew down a flexible gas tube and arranged it
so that by means of a reflector an intense penetrating light
could be directed upon any portion of the subject; Allcut then
with a surgeon's knife quickly and skilfully cut out a piece of
flesh in the neighborhood of the spine.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, this treatment brought the
subject to his senses; he uttered a cry of pain, and doubtless
essayed to move, but that was impossible. Irving directed a spray
of some chemical mixture upon the sides of the incision made by
Allcut, that had the effect of stopping the flow of blood.
Meanwhile Kingley proceeded to give vent to the most awful cries
and yells of pain. He called on me, and prayed for release.
Irving and Allcut paid no more attention than if they had been
stone deaf. They proceeded methodically to make their microscopic
examinations, relieving one another at the task every now and
again. Presently fresh incisions were made on the corresponding
side, calling forth renewed shrieks from the unhappy
sufferer.</p>

<p>All that day it kept on, and I had to sit there, faint and
hungry, listening; to it. At times they would leave off and
recruit themselves with refreshment, some of which they
administered to Kingley, releasing his bead for the purpose. His
prayers and entreaties for mercy were agonising. Sometimes he
would blaspheme and execrate me for bringing him into the snare;
to this my two purchasers gave not the slightest heed, putting it
down, I suppose, as an attempt of mine to delude them.</p>

<p>By twelve o'clock that night the wretched subject presented a
fearful sight. His tortured quivering body was half cut away, and
yet done with such anatomical skill that no vital part had been
touched. He had fainted for a time, and an awful silence had
succeeded his moans and screams. Awful to me, for the uproar he
had made hid covered any noise I inadvertently caused at times.
Three o'clock, and a look of triumph beamed upon the faces of the
operators; they were evidently upon the eve of a discovery. Their
researches became more minute in the internal organs of the
victim, whose sobs of pain and hollow groans grew more
heartrending. Suddenly his broken prayers that they would kill
him, and torture him no longer, ceased. Both the physiologists
lifted their heads with an ejaculation of disappointment.
Dead!</p>

<p>"And the secret has once more escaped," said Irving, "on the
eve of discovery."</p>

<p>"This is not Vallance," said Allcut; "his constitution and
nerve would have lasted out longer."</p>

<p>"I have guessed so for some time," returned Irving. "However,
we have gained something, and, as Vallance cannot
escape&mdash;well, we shall have an opportunity of starting
further advanced than we were before."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Irving, "Vallance, I must say, showed great
ingenuity in providing a substitute. I suppose he did not tell
this fellow what he would have to undergo."</p>

<p>While speaking they had gone on dissecting the body of their
victim, drawing one another's attention to different points as
they did so. Then washing their hands, and leaving the ghastly
members of the late living healthy man upon the bloodstained
slab, they went out and locked the door after them.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say I felt remarkably happy! One thing I did
enjoy, however, the opportunity of stretching my cramped limbs.
Then I hunted up the refreshments, and satisfied the cravings of
hunger. It was not pleasant company to eat in, two dead
men&mdash;one beautifully cut up into small pieces; but the
prospect of becoming like him troubled me more than the ghastly
society I was taking my meal in.</p>

<p>As six o'clock struck I heard a hand on the door and hastily
regained my place of concealment. A man entered with a large
basket on his arm. I knew him by sight; he was a porter at one of
the hospitals I had formerly haunted. His purpose was obvious; to
remove the mangled remnants of my friend Kingley. The porter
proceeded to put the portions of the human body in his basket,
whistling carelessly as he did he; meanwhile I decided upon a
course of action. Having finished his task my visitor glanced
curiously round the room, and stood for some time examining some
colored anatomical engravings lying on a side table.</p>

<p>Taking an iron rod that had formerly supported the skeleton
whose place I had usurped, I stole noiselessly behind the
unsuspecting porter. I had no wish to kill him, only to stun him,
but am afraid that in my excitement I struck rather too hard;
however I never had an opportunity of hearing, so cannot say.
Having felled him I put on his outer clothing, dragged his body
into the cabinet to keep Hall company, took the remains of poor
deceived Kingley upon my head, and sauntered out whistling the
same air the porter had been solacing himself with. I found a
cart and horse in the street as I had expected, and drove off in
the cold winter twilight a free man.</p>

<p>I knew the routine at the hospital well; my former visits
stood me in good stead now. I therefore got rid of my burden
successfully, and plunged into the lowest suburb to be found in
London. I had money, having always carried a large sum in cash on
my person to be ready for an emergency. I lived for six months in
a quarter where the police never entered unless in a large force;
and then, thinking that the vigilance of the pursuit must have
relaxed, I shipped on board an outward-bound emigrant ship and
arrived in this colony before the mast. Queensland was one of the
places to which I had formerly forwarded money, and I found it
here safe and untouched. This has given me sufficient courage to
see if my other remittances are equally secure, and I am about
starting for&mdash;Is this Ipswich?&mdash;yes! Well, remember
your promise; I'm not a man to stand on trifles if you break it.
Good-bye.</p>
