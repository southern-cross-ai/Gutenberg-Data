<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="first">AS the shadows began to lengthen over Belmont&mdash;for the
cathedral chimes floating along the bosom of the waters proclaimed
the seventh hour&mdash;a long outrigged gig pair flashed round the
point into the level stretch of dead pool reaching right away to
the Wye Bridge. There was a pleasant smell of flowers lying upon
the sweet August air, a lowing of cattle, a reflection of many
boats in the track as the gig, propelled by four muscular arms,
slid on towards the town. There were only two men in the narrow
craft; and as they were double sculling, with long clean sweep,
making a musical click of oars in the rowlocks, there was not much
opportunity for conversation. The 'stroke,' a young fellow with
clear gray eyes and pleasant face, was clad in a suit of plain
white flannels; and perched upon the back of his head was a
light-blue cap&mdash;the badge of distinction sacred to those only
who have fought for the honour of the 'Varsity against their rivals
from the twin seat of learning, Oxford. Egbert&mdash;or as his
familiars called him&mdash;Bertie Trevor, the stroke in question,
had rowed 'four' in that year's Cambridge boat, and now, with his
friend Frederick Denton, was making a Wye boating tour from Hay to
Chepstow. Denton, a somewhat older man, sported the light-blue and
black of Caius College. He was not a blue, for two reasons: first,
because the severe training was not to his taste; and secondly, a
restless ambition and the result dependent upon a successful
university career had left him no time for such a serious and
practical business. A hard-working college tutor has no time for
the toil of pleasure.</p>

<p>They pulled on with regular sweeping rhythm till they were
almost within the bridge-shadows. An arrowy craft bearing a town
four rushed by with clean sweep and swirl upstream, a little knot
of admirers running along the bank in the wake of a flannel-clad
youth who was bent upon exercising an extraordinary ingenuity for
giving each of the unhappy crew the most apparently contradictory
directions. As they sped swiftly by Denton paused in his stroke and
looked over his shoulder at the thin line, like a gigantic spider,
fading in the golden track.</p>

<p>'That is what some people call pleasure,' he
observed&mdash;'sacrificing a perfect summer evening for the
satisfaction of sitting in a confined space for two hours to be
bullied by an implacable miscreant called a coach. Depend upon it
if it was called work, they wouldn't get a man to turn out.'</p>

<p>'I like their stroke,' Trevor replied. 'Well marked and lively,
and the last ounce pulled out.&mdash;What a grand stretch of water
this is, Denton!&mdash;two miles without a curve, and room for at
least five eights. If we only had such a river at Cambridge!'</p>

<p>A few more strokes and the landing stage was reached. A bronzed
Waterman, with visage tanned to the colour of Spanish mahogany,
awaited them on the barge: old 'Dick' Jordan, with his solitary
keen eye and everlasting pipe, best of men and bravest of watermen,
as every rowing man on the Wye can tell. He looked up into the
fading blue sky and prophesied, after the manner of his kind, a
fair day on the morrow.</p>

<p>'What time be you gentlemen going to start in the morning?' he
asked, addressing Trevor, whose light-blue cap he had immediately
spotted.</p>

<p>Trevor turned to his friend and asked what hour it was to
be.</p>

<p>'It depends altogether upon Phil, you know. He may get here
tonight, or not till to-morrow afternoon. We must leave it open,
Dick. Only, you had better have everything ready by ten,
o'clock.'</p>

<p>The two friends strolled together over the old&gt; stone bridge,
below which lay the cathedral and bishop's palace, with the trim
cloister gardens sloping down to the water-side. The clean city lay
very quiet in the evening. As they passed through the close, under
an avenue of ancient elms, there was a clamour of rooks in the
feathery branches, clear cut against the sky. Turning into Castle
Street, Denton came to a house at length, the door of which he
opened with a latchkey; for the twain had deemed it best to take a
lodging, instead of availing themselves of the accommodation of the
<i>Green Dragon</i>. In the hall were two small portmanteaus,
bearing the monogram P. D. in neat black letters. Denton's face
lighted with pleasure. In the joint sitting-room up-stairs there
were the remains of a meal, as if some one had recently partaken of
refreshment and on the table a card, upon which were written the
words, 'Back in half an hour.'</p>

<p>But the appointed time went on, and the expected guest had not
reappeared. Tea had been disposed of; the windows were thrown open,
and our friends sat over their pipes, looking out upon the Castle
Green, where the world of Hereford was taking its pleasure in the
cool summer evening.</p>

<p>'I wonder what has become of Decie?' Trevor observed. 'It's
nearly nine o'clock.'</p>

<p>'I hope he isn't going to make an ass of himself as he did in
the Easter "Vac,"' Denton said practically. 'You never saw such a
wet blanket; and a fellow who had just come into a clear three
thousand a year, too! And twelve months ago there wasn't a
cheerier, happier man in the 'Varsity.'</p>

<p>Trevor pulled at his pipe a few moments in reflective
silence.</p>

<p>'I noticed the change when we were at Cookham together at the
commencement of this "long" Colden had a houseboat there with a lot
of people in the party; and when Dixon and I agreed to join, Phil
cut it. After agreeing to join, too! Miss Rashleigh was one of
them; and, between ourselves, Decie would have jumped at the chance
of meeting her once.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Miss Rashleigh was there!' Denton replied reflectively. 'My
dear Bertie, did it ever strike you that that was the very reason
why Phil threw over Colden at the last moment? I daresay you won't
believe me, but it is the fact nevertheless.'</p>

<p>'We used to think Phil would have married her.'</p>

<p>'We were not the only people who thought so: anyway, there was
something between them. She is a nice girl; and I dare swear that
if anything was wrong, it wasn't her fault. Phil was poor enough
then; but she liked him better than any of us, all the same.
Everything seemed to go smoothly enough, till that unpleasant
affair over the diamond bracelet.'</p>

<p>'I never heard of it,' said Trevor. 'Where was that?'</p>

<p>'Well, perhaps I ought not to mention it; but I was under the
impression you knew. It was during the May races last
year&mdash;you didn't keep that term I recollect now. And they were
all up there&mdash;Colonel Scobell and his family, with Miss
Rashleigh, who is his niece, you know.&mdash;I was all the more put
out because the affair happened in my rooms. The Scobells had been
very kind to Decie the "long" before, and nothing would do but he
must give them a lunch; and my rooms, being some of the best in the
college, were borrowed for the purpose. Miss Rashleigh's diamond
bracelet, the last thing her mother gave her before she died, was
lost.'</p>

<p>'Seems strange to lose a thing like that in a man's rooms.'</p>

<p>'Precisely&mdash;that is the most unpleasant part of it. It was
only laid down for a moment in an inner apartment; and when Miss
Rashleigh went in, it was gone. No servant had been there&mdash;no
one but Decie and Gerard Rashleigh, her brother, you
know.&mdash;Anyway, it was never found.'</p>

<p>'What do you make of it?' Trevor asked cautiously. 'Valuable
trinkets like that don't disappear without aid. Still, at the same
time, it would be absurd to dream of Phil having a hand in it.'</p>

<p>Denton watched the smoke curling round his bead for a few
minutes. His next words startled Bertie out of his philosophic
calm: '<i>We</i> shouldn't; but there is no doubt Miss Rashleigh
did&mdash;and does.'</p>

<p>'My dear Fred, you rave! Philip Decie would cut off his right
hand first. Besides, with all his money'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, see how rash youth rushes to conclusions.&mdash;How long
is it since Philip's uncle died and left him a fortune?&mdash;Five
months. And up to that time, if you had searched the university of
Cambridge through, you would not have found a poorer undergraduate
than Decie.'</p>

<p>'But surely you don't think'&mdash;</p>

<p>Of course I don't; and if you suggest such a thing, I shall
assault and batter you in the first degree. But I know a little
more about women than you; and, to put it harshly, I have a strong
suspicion that Miss Rashleigh entertains the enlightened idea that
Phil stole her bracelet.'</p>

<p>'Only shows the sagacity of some women,' returned the
enlightened philosopher of twenty-three sapiently.&mdash;'Why, I
would trust my life to old Phil.&mdash;Great Scott! Denton, fancy
any one&mdash;any one being idiot enough to believe that Decie
could do such a blackguardly thing!'</p>

<p>Bertie laid aside his pipe in disgust, and regarded Hereford's
innocent citizens below as if they, with the rest of mankind, bad
done him a personal and irretrievable injury. But any reply of
Denton's was prevented by the entrance of the maligned hero in
question. There was nothing in either air or manner to denote the
blighted swain. Decie presented a picture of the typical Englishman
of twenty-five as he appears under the advantages conferred upon
most young men by a liberal education, and an acquaintance with the
refinements and amenities of life in the upper middle classes. Like
the others, he was clad in flannels and boating jacket, the
distinguishing badge of a Trinity man. With the exception of a
half-melancholy smile and a certain sombre light in the dark eyes,
sorrow or care had laid a light hand upon him.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to have kept you waiting,' said he, after the first
greeting; 'but the fact is I strolled into the <i>Dragon</i>
billiard-room, and the first man I saw there was Du Maurier.'</p>

<p>Denton coughed dryly, a sternutation which might have meant
anything, but which, as both Decie and Trevor were aware, simply
denoted Denton's dislike of the individual in question.</p>

<p>'What brings that desirable youth in these parts?' he asked. 'I
thought he usually spent his vacation at Monaco or Monte Carlo,
where fools with more money than brains most do congregate.'</p>

<p>'Appears he is staying in the neighbourhood,' Decie answered
briefly. 'Some friend who has taken a house down the river. The
Frenchman is not communicative, and I didn't press him, you may be
sure.'</p>

<p>'Well, it doesn't matter.&mdash;And now, anent to-morrow. I
suppose there is no reason why we shouldn't start at nine
o'clock?'</p>

<p>Phil nodded, without taking his pipe from his mouth. It was all
one to him what time they started, for, sooth to say, his first
enthusiasm in the trip had vanished, and he felt in no mood for
discussing details which once upon a time would have been a source
of interest and pleasure. Moreover, the meeting with Du
Maurier&mdash;a fascinating Gaul, who had, for certain diplomatic
reasons, deemed it advisable to become a Cambridge
undergraduate&mdash;had aroused within him the rankling soreness of
an old wound, which he flattered himself had long since entirely
healed. In spite of Denton's brusqueness and apparent want of
feeling, he was naturally of a tender sympathetic disposition, and
refrained from rallying Phil upon his preoccupation, a want of
attention for which the latter was truly grateful. So, upon the
whole, the long-expected meeting could not be pronounced a
brilliant success.</p>

<p>But when morning dawned, with a fair blue sky and a gentle
breeze rippling in the immemorial elms, it was not in the elastic
and buoyant nature of youth in the twenties to preserve the grave
decorum of misanthropy. The gig, provided with a pair of long light
oars, and short pole for stream-work, lay alongside the barge, her
bows filled with multitudinous packages, and covered with a
waterproof sheet calculated to afford a haven of shelter at nights.
A few minutes past ten they swung round, shooting the pointed stone
arches, floating past the palace and cloister gardens, down the
rippling stream, with the fair meadows sloping towards the valley
lying in the bosom of a ring of purple hills. Gradually they slid
down in the beautiful morning, along by fair homesteads and quaint
gabled farmhouses, through silent pools where the blue flash of the
kingfishers darted in zigzag flight, or over broad rippling streams
where the salmon nets hung drying on the willows. Decie and Trevor
were rowing; Denton lounging in the sternsheets, smoking lazily, or
making humorous remarks upon the fishermen as they passed.</p>

<p>'Every man has a vocation in life,' he observed sententiously,
'though fate so often ordains a round peg for a square hole. If I
hadn't been a hard-working university coach, I should have made a
perfect loafer.'</p>

<p>'To see you now, any one would think you were the idlest man
under the sun,' Bertie returned between the strokes; 'and yet you
profess to despise affectation. There isn't a more ambitious fellow
in Cambridge than you.'</p>

<p>'I don't know about that, though. It runs in too many grooves.
There is Barton, of Jesus, with a sole ambition to get his boat
head of the river again; Moffat, my old tutor, who is wild to
become Professor of some ology at Trinity; or young Rashleigh, the
cleverest pupil I ever had, whose ambition seems to be to get to
the dogs in the shortest possible space of time.&mdash;You remember
him, Phil?'</p>

<p>Phil, pulling bow-oar, with his face hidden from the speaker,
flushed with something more than the exertion he was undergoing,
replied through his set teeth that he did. And, considering that
the youth in question was only brother to the particular star of
poor Phil's slighted devotion, it is only too palpable that he
spoke the truth.</p>

<p>'I have not seen him for a long while,' he continued, fearful,
with all the painful self-consciousness of a lover, that his
silence would be read and misconstrued. We&mdash;we used to be
rather thick, you know. I&mdash;I have rather fancied that for the
last term or two he has fought shy of me.'</p>

<p>'He seemed to have drifted into a precious bad set,' said
Bertie, with all an athlete's contempt for the venial sins of
college life&mdash;'Everton and Leslie, and the card-playing,
tandem-driving division. Of course, it is no business of mine; but
knowing a little of Rashleigh's financial affairs, I don't see how
it can last.'</p>

<p>'It won't last,' Denton returned. 'There will be a scandal some
of these days, and exit Gerard Rashleigh and a few others who shall
be nameless. And yet,' continued the speaker regretfully, 'it's a
pity, a great pity&mdash;a lad like that with good feelings and
generous instincts, only wanting a kind, firm guide to turn out a
credit to himself and his college.'</p>

<p>'You are altogether mistaken, Denton. Young as he is, Rashleigh
is a hardened, unscrupulous scoundrel.'</p>

<p>Denton propped himself upon his elbow so that he could get a
better glance at the speaker's face. Phil's eyes were glowing with
passion, every feature blazing with indignation. As his glance fell
upon Denton's amazed countenance, he checked himself with a visible
effort and bit his lip.</p>

<p>'Now, that is the sort of house I should like to call mine,'
said the steersman, with an abrupt change in the conversation, as
he indicated a noble-looking residence rising out of a belt of
trees upon an abrupt eminence. If I have a weakness, it is for a
half-timbered house. I could close my eyes and dream aesthetic
dreams of future bliss, were I the owner of yon paradise.'</p>

<p>He closed his eyes as he spoke; while Trevor laughed at this
simulated ecstasy. It was not a particularly brilliant or humorous
remark, but anything was better than the awkward silence caused by
Decie's impulsive words. But in reality the wily Denton was lost in
no earthly paradise; he was racking his brains to discover the
mystery underlying Phil's emphatic utterance. The spectacle
presented at this point by an elderly gentleman in a tweed
shooting-cap and waders wielding a salmon rod at the head of a
broad stream was hailed by all three as a positive relief to the
feeling of constraint which had fallen upon them.</p>

<p>'If I was a betting man,' Bertie cried with suppressed
excitement, 'I should make a small wager that is Colonel
Scobell.'</p>

<p>Decie turned his eyes in the direction of the fisherman. A few
powerful strokes brought them nearer.</p>

<p>'It is the Colonel. What brings him here?' he said.</p>

<p>'Any sport, Colonel?' cried Trevor in his audacious
style.&mdash;'How do they die?'</p>

<p>Colonel Scobell, in the act of making a cast, paused, and got
his 'butcher' hopelessly entangled in the willows behind. Denton
steered the boat to the side; and the old Crimean hero stood knee
deep in the rushing stream, offering a sinewy brown hand to each of
the watermen in turn.</p>

<p>'You are a nice lot of fellows to come into my neighbourhood
without letting me know,' he exclaimed. 'Explain yourselves.'</p>

<p>'Now, mark the pride of the man!' said Denton oracularly. 'His
neighbourhood! Think of it! And only last year he had the audacity
to use the same expression, which&mdash;correct me if I am
wrong&mdash;included the whole of the Thames valley.'</p>

<p>The Colonel explained that he had taken for the summer months
the mansion which had so excited the last speaker's envy. It struck
the kind-hearted warrior, directly he had heard the wanderers'
plans, that it would be a good joke to take them all up to
Pencraig, as the house was termed, and keep them there for a few
days. And knowing from old experience that any argument with one of
the grandest of nature's gentlemen would be so much wasted time,
they accepted the offer with something akin to gratitude.</p>

<p>Without waiting for his rod, the Colonel led the way up the
rocky path, leaving Phil to arrange some little matters connected
with the boat. Ten minutes later, as he turned to follow, the
bushes parted, and a figure with nether limbs clad in
knickerbockers and a straw hat perched upon his head stood before
him. The newcomer eyed Decie with a peculiar glance, in which fear
and deference, defiance and mistrust, were strangely mingled. Phil
recoiled as one does instinctively from a noxious animal, though
the individual before him was neither unpleasant nor repulsive to
the view.</p>

<p>'What, in the name of all that's evil, brings you here?' he
cried.&mdash;'Look here, Rashleigh: I don't want to do anything
unpleasant, for the sake'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, drop that,' cried the other doggedly. 'The fact is I am
staying here with Scobell; and when I met the other fellows, I
thought I would run down and warn you I was here. You needn't make
it unpleasant for Beatrice, if you do for me.'</p>

<p>'Beatrice! Is she here too?'</p>

<p>'That's just what I came to tell you. If you mind'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of course I mind,' said Phil, with a deep sternness which would
have astonished Denton had he but seen it. 'Do you think I would
have come, had I known? If you had a spark of manliness, you could
put a stop to all this misery and trouble.'</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first">SOME men are naturally homely; others more prone to a wandering
life, and Colonel Scobell was one of the latter. He had a great
predilection for 'camping out,' to use his own term, which in his
case invariably meant taking a cosy country-house for the summer
months and immediately asking all of his acquaintances to fill it.
As the Colonel's good-nature was only exceeded by his
thoughtlessness, and that is saying a great deal, complications and
confusions were by no means a rarity. But blessed with a good wife
who understood his little weaknesses, these contretemps usually
ended happily.</p>

<p>Pencraig was a beautiful old house, of semi-Elizabethan
architecture, with plenty of large airy apartments, and an unknown
quantity of bedrooms. As the three voyagers stood upon the terrace,
they caught a glimpse of light draperies, and heard the ripple of
girlish laughter from a shady tennis lawn. The Colonel led the way
into a cool dim drawing-room, where they found Mrs Scobell deep in
the delightful chronicles of <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>.</p>

<p>'I have brought you some more visitors, Belle,' cried the
Colonel. 'A most fortunate thing I was down on the Rock Cottage
streams as they went by. Fancy not knowing we were in the
neighbourhood!'</p>

<p>Mrs Scobell, a rosy plump little lady, who had been a beauty in
her time, before a sturdy harum-scarum family had come to be the
joint plague and joy of her life, shook hands heartily. And she was
not the least less pleased to see her visitors, despite the fact
that she hadn't the smallest idea how they were going to be
accommodated.</p>

<p>'Thank goodness it is no worse,' she said. 'Oh, of course I
don't mean that you know, only the Colonel is so inconsiderate. It
is only last week that he went off fishing below Ross and brought
back no fewer than five with him, not one of whom he had seen
before. Of coarse, it seems very inhospitable, but I had to put two
in the billiard-room.'</p>

<p>'That Scotch fellow could tie a fly, though,' the Colonel
observed reflectively. 'He had a way of dressing "hackles" I never
saw before.'</p>

<p>'And that covers a multitude of sins,' said Denton, with a
laugh.&mdash;'But you can make yourself easy about that, Mrs
Scobell. I need not ask if you have a houseful. Any one here we
know?'</p>

<p>'I expect so. There is Miss Rashleigh and her brother; the
Moffat girls&mdash;five of them; and in fact several others. We are
very short of gentlemen.'</p>

<p>'Oh, come now,' the Colonel remonstrated. 'There are young
Rashleigh and myself, with our three friends here, to say nothing
of Du Maurier.'</p>

<p>Denton shot a significant glance at Bertie, who looked in his
turn towards Decie. Beyond a quick flush of colour in his cheeks
and a mechanical clenching of the right hand, he betrayed no sign.
It was a relief to the awkward silence when the luncheon bell
rang.</p>

<p>'We are in luck,' said Denton grimly, when the trio were
changing in the privacy of their apartment&mdash;a large room with
three beds set apart for bachelors and such erratic visitors.
'Rashleigh <i>and</i> Du Maurier! The Colonel isn't a gambling man,
Phil, I apprehend?'</p>

<p>'About the last man in the world to amuse himself that
way.&mdash;You are wondering what brings Du Maurier down here. No
good, you may be certain.'</p>

<p>In the dining-room the ample table was laid for eighteen, though
that unconventional, but none the less cosy meal, luncheon, as
interpreted in a country house, was apparently anything but well
patronised. The Colonel liked to see his young friends enjoying
themselves, and so long as dinner was not delayed, they could drop
in or out from luncheon as the spirit moved them. A group of merry
maidens, clad in flannel tennis costumes and striped jackets, and
carrying the warmth and excitement of the fascinating game in their
flushed faces, stood chattering before the cool fern-decked
fireplace as Denton with his gallant crew entered.</p>

<p>'My prayer has been answered,' cried the tallest of the group, a
dark vivacious-looking girl, rejoicing in the name of Gwendolyn
Moffat. 'I have prayed for some boating-men, and they have
come.&mdash;Mr Trevor, I have been here more than a fortnight and
never on the river once. And till I came here I was getting on
splendidly with my sculling.'</p>

<p>'Let's have a look at your knuckles,' said Bertie; 'that will
soon show.'</p>

<p>Miss Gwen held out a long white hand pure and stainless as
marble. But the light blue 'four,' not being gifted with a
sculptor's admiration of the beautiful, eyed the slim fingers
critically and from a purely athletic point of view.</p>

<p>'Oh, we'll soon alter that,' he said cheerfully.&mdash;'Don't
you remember what a state they were in last Easter after a
fortnight's coaching?&mdash;Come with me after luncheon. We've got
the old gig and a famous pair of sculls.'</p>

<p>Denton, cynic as he was, found himself in the toils of a sister
siren ambitious of aquatic honours, and in a few moments was making
arrangements for forming an amateur 'pair,' under the watchful eye
of himself and Bertie Trevor, with all the eagerness of a
schoolboy. So busily engaged were they, that no notice was taken of
the advent of a new-comer, another girl in tennis costume. But Phil
saw, and turned a little paler as his eyes encountered hers. She
came towards the gay group almost reluctantly. Decie bowed low, to
hide the flush of colour that would rise to his cheek. As she
turned away, standing by one of the open windows, he crossed over
to her.</p>

<p>Her fair sweet face was hidden from him, but she seemed to feel
his presence.</p>

<p>'Why did you come?' she asked, still gazing fixedly at the
landscape.</p>

<p>'I could not help myself.&mdash;No; do not misunderstand me. I
am not paying you an idle compliment. The simple truth is that I
did not know you were here. I will keep out of your sight as much
as possible.'</p>

<p>Beatrice Rashleigh made no reply for a moment; her face was very
white and set, had he but seen it; but Phil was not looking in her
direction, for the simple reason that he was afraid to do so.</p>

<p>'There is room enough here for both of us,' she said. 'Still, it
would be ridiculous to attract attention. Outwardly at least we can
be friends. I hope I have made my meaning plain enough?'</p>

<p>The words were very cold, though Decie could not guess what a
violent effort they cost the speaker. His mind was too full of
bitterness and despair to comprehend the feelings of another.</p>

<p>'Perfectly plain,' he replied. 'You may rest assured that I
shall not trouble you with my company. Still, we had better have a
complete arrangement. If you can spare me a few moments presently,
I shall be grateful.'</p>

<p>'It shall be as you wish; but only this once, understand.'</p>

<p>Miss Rashleigh quitted her position and took a seat at the
table. There was a vacant chair by her side, into which a late
corner presently glided. He was a young-old man, to coin an
expression&mdash;young in air and manner, and in the lower part of
his face, which was ornamented by an elaborately waxed moustache;
though his narrow receding forehead was lined and wrinkled, and his
densely black hair was growing somewhat thin&mdash;the only sign by
which, said Denton, Horace Du Maurier showed his fast life and
dissipated habits.</p>

<p>Decie experienced an inward spasm of relief, curiously mingled
with pain, as Beatrice rose from her seat and disappeared. He did
not, however, view with corresponding equanimity the speedy exit of
the fascinating Horace, or the little smile of meaning telegraphed
from face to face with that instinctive freemasonry, the secret of
which is known only to the gentler sex.</p>

<p>'I don't like that man,' Edith Moffat murmured, for Phil's ear
alone. She was the youngest of the family, only just out, and an
old friend and favourite of Decie's. 'What can Beatrice be thinking
about?'</p>

<p>'Oh, there is something between them, is there?' asked Phil
coolly. 'They were quite alone by this time. Down the winding path
towards the river, Denton and Trevor were just disappearing from
view, accompanied by the fair crew, for a long lazy afternoon on
the water. 'How long has it been going on?'</p>

<p>'Before we came here&mdash;when we were in town, I imagine. I
can't think what has come to Beatrice. And I am certain Mr Du
Manlier is not a gentleman. However, it has nothing to do with
me&mdash;it is <i>someone else's</i> business.&mdash;When are you
going to teach me that back-handed cut?'</p>

<p>Phil gave his solemn promise to lose no time in imparting the
dark secret; and content with this assurance, and, sooth to say,
finding her companion somewhat dull, Miss Edith departed.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later when, in crossing the terrace, he came
full upon the versatile Frenchman, smoking a scented cigarette, and
attired in a superb knickerbocker suit and velvet gaiters reaching
almost to the knee. Had he been a Cockney snob instead of a Gallic
cad, thought Phil bitterly, he would have found scant welcome at
Pencraig.</p>

<p>'I am going to show Miss Rashleigh some of the neighbouring
beauties,' he explained airily. 'It is a pleasure to point out to
her the beautiful&mdash;she has the soul.'</p>

<p>'She has a nice little fortune of her own, too,' said Phil
dryly.</p>

<p>Du Maurier shot a suspicious glance at the speaker out of his
glittering eyes&mdash;a glance Deciere turned with a smile of
contempt. The Frenchman flipped the ashes from his cigarette
languidly.</p>

<p>'You English take an interest in these sordid, these prosaic
details. We, on the other hand, ignore them. When we love, we love
madly.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;to command. A little money and a little love&mdash;an
admirable mixture, which is a credit to your disinterested
motives.'</p>

<p>'You speak in enigmas, <i>mon ami</i>,' Du Maurier returned
coldly. 'And I like not your tone. In all politeness, I offer you
the chance of explanation.'</p>

<p>Decie, though by no means phlegmatic in temperament, held his
rival in such profound contempt that all anger was swallowed up in
the prevailing emotion. As the Frenchman's valiant blood rose, so
much the cooler did Phil become.</p>

<p>'Now, all this histrionic business is very taking, no doubt,
with people who don't happen to know you. I do. And, without
egotism on my part, you will gain nothing by a quarrel&mdash;from a
physical point, that is. You have made up your mind that you love
Miss Rashleigh&mdash;for her money. I won't have it.'</p>

<p>'He will not have it!' returned the Frenchman, addressing a
gorgeous peacock sailing by in friendly rivalry. 'This dogmatic
gentleman will not have it. Horace, <i>mon cher</i>, you will
please take the back seat.'</p>

<p>'You will have to accept my terms all the same.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I shall have to accept your terms! And wherefore,
M'sieu?'</p>

<p>'Because, unless you cease this&mdash;this impertinence, you
will be under the painful necessity of depriving yourself of the
pleasure of Colonel Scobell's hospitality.'</p>

<p>The immaculate Horace came within measurable distance of losing
his studied calm altogether. Though a torrent of passion boiled in
his veins, there was nothing to indicate a consuming rage beyond a
pink spot burning upon his high cheekbones. But with the instinct
of a true adventurer, he scented danger; and, like the hunter,
braced his nerves for the fray.</p>

<p>'You take a high hand, my friend,' he lightly replied. '<i>Ma
foi</i>, you English have a strange way of doing things. I thank
you for warning me. But as your proverb says, "At that game, two
can play." And if I go to the excellent Colonel and say, "You have
a thief in the house!"'</p>

<p>Phil laughed aloud, so loud, that Miss Edith, waiting upon the
tennis lawn for the initiation into the mystery of the 'cut,'
wondered what excellent joke the pair had discovered.</p>

<p>'You would obtain Miss Rashleigh's permission first. Pah! you
are a shallower rogue than I took you for. I am certain you could
know nothing of that unless you had a hand in it. Besides, Colonel
Scobell would be much more likely to throw you out of the window
than believe such a tale. Why can't you take a hint?'</p>

<p>'And if I refuse this peremptory request?'</p>

<p>'Then I must speak more plainly. I want no scandal here, the
less that your name has become connected with Miss Rashleigh's. I
am not speaking without book, understand. I am going to tax your
excellent memory, which I have so often and fortunately seen
displayed at games of skill&mdash;and <i>chance</i>.'</p>

<p>During this speech, the Frenchman had shifted his ground
uneasily. The cool measured scorn in Phil's voice alarmed him more
than any outburst of violence could have done, there was such a
ring of assured certainty behind every word. He had betrayed
himself once, a <i>faux pas</i> he had no intention of
repeating.</p>

<p>'I will call your mind back to a year ago, when you did the
university the honour of enrolling yourself as a member. There is a
certain billiard-room in the High Street kept by a rascally Greek,
and officiated over by an equally rascally marker, a Frenchman like
yourself&mdash;in fact, your brother.' Phil uttered these words so
quickly and simply, that Du Maurier for a moment failed to
comprehend their import. His face was very white and set; he would
have spoken, had not Decie waved him aside.</p>

<p>'Yes; I see you remember. You will also recollect young Selby of
Trinity. As a source of income he was invaluable to you, I
understand. It was one night in the May term I allude to, that,
after making him extremely tipsy, you won from him something like
fifteen hundred at billiards. He tells me he has no recollection of
the event; but you say he gave you bills to that amount, which he
does not dispute, and that they were left with you to discount. As
Selby was a rich minor at that time, you had no difficulty in
passing them. But, like most other knaves, you overreached
yourself. A bill was presented by you the other day, and
discounted. Selby, somewhat dubious about the signature, handed it
to me. It was dated 5th March 1886, which was apparently correct.
But upon reading the red stamp in the corner, I found the singular
figures 18-1-87. To put it plainly, the thing is a forgery, for the
bill stamp is younger than the bill I need not explain further to a
man of your sagacity that this is why I do not consider you a fit
companion to cicerone Miss Rashleigh or any other <i>lady</i> round
the neighbourhood.'</p>

<p>Du Maurier moistened his dry lips and tried to swallow the
choking lump that would rise into his throat. His face presented a
singular appearance, like a dead white coal touched with low
gleaming points of flame. All his <i>savoir faire</i>, his easy
assurance, had disappeared; he looked what he was, a pitiful
detected swindler face to face with his accuser.</p>

<p>'You will not say anything of this?' he gasped.</p>

<p>'As my friend Selby does not wish to be written down an ass, I
shall say nothing. I owe you no malice. Only one stipulation I
certainly make, and that is&mdash;you leave Pencraig by the first
convenient train to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'I am in your hands,' the discomfited Horace replied. 'I must do
as you ask. Only, my friend, if you ever come across me again, look
to yourself.'</p>

<p>To this characteristic gasconade, Phil deigned no reply beyond a
look of supreme disdain. He was perfectly satisfied with himself,
and the way he had conducted the somewhat trying interview; for,
say what you will, it is no pleasant matter to accuse any one of a
mean and contemptible action, to say nothing of a crime.</p>

<p>The afternoon dragged on somewhat slowly till dinner-time
arrived. It was not a full-dress affair, though most of the ladies
were resplendent in shimmering draperies and shining arms. There
was no lack of conversation, with the exception of Decie and his
late antagonist, who were strangely silent&mdash;the latter, as
Phil did not fail to notice, paying more attention to the champagne
than thirst or the dictates of good breeding ordains.</p>

<p>'That class of fellow never can resist champagne' said Bertie
<i>sotto voce</i>, as he called Phil's attention to the Frenchman's
flushed cheeks and gleaming eyes. But Phil did not heed. He was
listening with all his ears to a song floating out from the
drawing-room, a song he well remembered, the refrain of which rang
in his heart like a I sharp pain. As he turned in the direction of
the salon, he encountered Beatrice Rashleigh walking towards the
garden. With the courage of despair, he turned and took his place,
by her side. They promenaded some distance in silence. A soft moon
rode high in the blue arch, shining upon the swift flowing river
and on the painful pallor of the girl's face.</p>

<p>'You had better say all you have to say,' she said. 'I did not
seek this interview.'</p>

<p>'I think it is my right,' said Phil gently. 'It is more than a
year ago since we parted with a tacit understanding. I loved you
then&mdash;I always shall. Unless you had a little affection for me
then, you must be the most selfish coquette that ever took delight
in breaking a man's heart.'</p>

<p>'You do me scant justice, Mr Decie. My friends do not find me
so.'</p>

<p>Beatrice stooped over a rose-tree, breaking off a fragrant
golden bud, and carried it to her face. It was not a pleasant or
soothing gesture, but her hands trembled so that she felt forced to
give them some occupation. But all this was lost upon Phil, who
read in it a callous coldness.</p>

<p>'I want you to tell me why you behaved so to me&mdash;indeed, I
will know. There is something more in your manner than
indifference&mdash;there is dislike, contempt. What have I done to
merit this?'</p>

<p>'What have you done!' Beatrice cried passionately. 'You have
bitterly deceived me. I liked and trusted you&mdash;nay, more, if
you will hear the truth, I loved you until that day&mdash;you, you
know of. Oh, Phil, Phil, why did you not come to me if you were in
trouble or distress, and tell me everything! Do you think that I
should have thought the less of you because such things do not come
within the unwritten laws of society? I would not have minded; I
would have helped you.'</p>

<p>'I daresay you would,' Phil returned forlornly, 'only I had no
occasion to ask for your help. I understand what you mean. How can
I help it? You think I&mdash;I stole your diamond bracelet!'</p>

<p>'How otherwise?' retorted Beatrice. She had recovered from her
momentary fit of emotion, and looked him in the face with hard
scornful eyes. 'You always made me your
<i>confidante</i>&mdash;even that silly escapade of yours when you
had to pawn your watch, I heard of from you. I have a good memory
for trifles. Do you remember the assumed name you used on that
occasion?'</p>

<p>'I am not so used to the inside of those places that I am likely
to forget,' said Phil bitterly. 'To be correct, it was Philip
Reid.'</p>

<p>Beatrice answered nothing, but taking from the bosom of her
dress a square yellow ticket, handed it to her companion. It bore
the name and address of a well-known Cambridge jeweller, and ran to
the effect that a certain diamond bracelet with ruby medallion had
been deposited with the person therein named, to secure the
repayment of a loan of thirty pounds advanced to Philip Reid.</p>

<p>Phil gazed at the shabby little pasteboard like a man in a
dream. The idea of his being guilty of such an act struck him dumb
with amazement.</p>

<p>'Beatrice,' he said solemnly, as soon as he found voice to
speak, 'on my word of honour, I know nothing of this. Still, the
proof is strong&mdash;undeniably strong. Will you try and trust me
once more?'</p>

<p>'What is it you want me to do?'</p>

<p>'Leave this in my hands for a little while. Will you?'</p>

<p>She turned away from him with a choking sob. All the harshness
and coldness had melted from her heart; she was for the moment a
gentle loving woman.</p>

<p>'Anything to clear this wretched mystery. If you can restore my
broken faith, it will be the happiest day I have known for eighteen
months.'</p>

<p>Without another word she turned away, leaving Phil to gaze after
her in rapt astonishment.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">ON the morning following, before Pencraig was awake, Colonel
Scobell had fished his favourite stream, aided and abetted by the
gardener's boy, a precocious youth, intended eventually for a
naturalist or a poacher, as the gods decreed, and succeeded in
catching three fish. The three shining monsters were carried up to
the house in triumph, and laid on a stone in the dairy, where a
well-attended levee was held till breakfast-time. So delighted was
the Colonel with this unique accomplishment, that in the exuberance
of his joy he proposed a picnic down the river in honour of the
occasion. Mrs Scobell, always most happy when her spouse was
pleased, fell in with this arrangement There was not a particularly
large gathering at the early breakfast, consisting of the Moffat
girls and our trio, concluding with Du Maurier, who had not yet
broken the direful tidings of his premature departure. Miss
Rashleigh did not put in an appearance.</p>

<p>'We will go to Ross by water,' Mrs Scobell explained. 'When we
reach there, we will decide what further to do.&mdash;Mr Denton, I
am told you are a capital hand at arranging these little matters.
Will you help me?'</p>

<p>Denton laid down his knife and fork, and regarded his hostess
with a look in which bewilderment and reproach were amusingly
blended. With Malvolio, he felt he had greatness thrust upon
him.</p>

<p>'My dear madam, some one has libelled me cruelly. Would you be
surprised to hear that I never attended such a function in my
life?'</p>

<p>'Oh, in that case we must go,' said the hostess good-naturedly.
'How many shall we be? There will be four of us&mdash;all you
girls, with Mr Du Maurier&mdash;no fewer than seventeen
altogether.'</p>

<p>'The invasion of Ross,' said Denton with a forlorn air. 'What a
sensation we shall create! The army of Pencraig, under the command
of Colonel Scobell.&mdash;Du Maurier, these knickerbockers of yours
will cause a <i>furor</i>.'</p>

<p>The gallant Frenchman smiled, but without his usual airy
assurance. He was by no means at ease, though he was somewhat
grateful to Denton for the opportunity afforded.</p>

<p>'It is a great disappointment, no doubt,' he said; 'but I shall
not be there. I have important business calling me to town, and I
shall be compelled to go to Hereford to-day. My charming hostess
will forgive this unavoidable termination to the pleasantest of
visits; but, ah! the stern calls of business; I shall be forced to
take my leave early tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Phil looked up at the speaker, whose eyes were fixed upon him in
a questioning manner, and nodded shortly. So long as the
fascinating Horace would not be present at the fête, it was a
matter of little moment whether he remained at Pencraig another
night or not. This decision was none the less satisfactory because
Phil had no intention of going himself. He had a little work to do,
and a great deal to think about. He also had a clue in his hands,
which, skilfully handled, would put an end to the painful coldness
between Beatrice and himself. As he sat upon the terrace smoking a
matutinal cigarette, Denton with a face of woe joined him.</p>

<p>'The die is cast!' he said. 'We are to go into Ross; though what
we are going to do there is a social problem beyond ordinary
understanding. I believe there is a fine church there, where we
shall spend the customary ten minutes. What follows, I shudder to
contemplate.'</p>

<p>'What a humbug you are!' Phil retorted. 'Just as if you won't
enjoy yourself as well as the rest of them. I know what the
programme will be, well enough. You will go down to Ross, taking
care that you and Bertie pull the gig pair with Gwen and Nellie
Moffat.'</p>

<p>'Not a bad idea,' said Denton, as if such a plan had been
furthest from his thoughts. 'We have only to drop a hint to some of
the women that the gig is not quite safe, and the thing is
done.&mdash;Now, as to yourself?'</p>

<p>'I shan't go&mdash;at least I don't think so. I&mdash;I have
some particular work to do. Only leave me that little oak dingey
for this afternoon. I dare-say I shall find time for a pull up to
Hoarwithy and back.'</p>

<p>Denton whistled softly; he was too much a man of the world to
inquire the reason for this unexpected determination.</p>

<p>'We shall be rather short of the nobler sex, in that case.
Rashleigh cannot favour us with his desirable company; we shall
mourn the absence of Horace the incomparable in silent
despair.&mdash;What's to be done?'</p>

<p>But the unexpected arrival of three Oxford undergraduates, who
had rushed over from Hereford owing to the collapse of a cricket
match, satisfactorily solved the problem. The party resolved itself
into a smaller one than had been at first anticipated, and as a
matter of fact the limited number of floating craft rendered this
imperative. It was past eleven before the three boats got under way
and slid gradually Out of sight round the Lend. Phil stood upon the
tiny wooden pier watching them, and smiling at the brilliant
diplomacy of Denton's, which had been attended by triumphant
success. He was not quite alone, for Miss Edith Moffat stood by his
side, an unmistakable pout disfiguring her pretty lips.</p>

<p>'It is too bad!' she exclaimed, with tears in her voice. 'I am
always left out.'</p>

<p>'Then why didn't you say you wanted to go?' asked Phil with
scant sympathy. 'There was plenty of room in our boat.'</p>

<p>An April smile darted across Miss Edith's piquant little face, a
saucy smile of meaning. 'There are <i>four</i> of them there, you
know. And besides I heard Mr Trevor say the boat was not quite
safe. Wasn't it brave of Nell and Gwen to risk such horrible
danger?'</p>

<p>'Very,' said Phil dryly. 'You are naturally a courageous family.
Still, if you can put up with such a commonplace cavalier as me, we
will have a long pull this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Delightful!&mdash;Only, there isn't a boat.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I took care of that. There is plenty of room in the little
dingey, if you only sit still, and exactly in the centre. You and I
will go as far as Hoarwithy directly after luncheon, and get back
in time for dinner.'</p>

<p>Miss Edith looked up at the deep blue sky above the larch
tassels, then down again to the swift running river, musical as it
rushed over the brown pebbles. She gazed seriously out of her great
eyes at her companion, as if she would read his thoughts.</p>

<p>'I wonder what you stayed behind for!' she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>'Now, I suppose that is what a woman would call
gratitude.&mdash;My dear Edie, have you so soon forgotten the moral
precepts of your schoolmistress? But seriously, I have something
important to do this morning. Don't ask me any questions, there is
a good child.'</p>

<p>'I am very sorry, Phil,' Miss Edith replied with humility. 'If
you would only let me help you a little. I&mdash;I understand that
you'&mdash;</p>

<p>'You are a good little girl, and I am very grateful.&mdash;No;
you can't help me, little one. I hope everything will come right in
a few days. When it does, you shall be the first to know.'</p>

<p>Philip Decie was not the kind of man to make a confidant of any
one; but the quick warm-hearted sympathy had touched him more
deeply than he cared to own. Moreover, it was not like confiding in
a stranger, for the girl had been an especial favourite of his ever
since he had first known her an imperious little beauty aged seven.
There had always been something in the frank innocence of her great
gray eyes that drew him towards her, child as she was, as one noble
nature is attracted by another. After this little interchange of
sympathy, it came almost like a shock to Phil when he encountered
Du Maurier strutting along the terrace, smoking one of his
everlasting scented cigarettes.</p>

<p>The Frenchman's colour rose as he saw Decie approaching. He bore
the air and manner of one who conquers his pride to ask a favour of
an unrelenting and implacable enemy.</p>

<p>'You will recollect our little conversation of last night?' he
asked.</p>

<p>'Um! I don't think it is likely either of us will forget it.
Still, your memory seems to have proved somewhat treacherous. I
made a certain stipulation as regards the duration of your stay
here.'</p>

<p>'Which is precisely what I am going to mention,' Du Maurier
exclaimed. 'I found it was impossible.'</p>

<p>'Impossible?' Phil returned, his face darkening. 'As for
that'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Nay; hear me out, my impetuous friend. It was impossible for me
to go today, for the simple reason that I had not the means of
taking myself away from here. Yesterday, I sent a telegram to a
friend, who can and will refuse me nothing'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Blackmail, probably,' Phil interrupted.&mdash;'Go on.'</p>

<p>'It matters not to you,' continued the Frenchman, with a flash
of his glittering eyes, 'so long as this remittance comes. I go
into Hereford this afternoon to get my letter, which shall wait for
me at the bureau. But to-morrow mid-day shall see me gone.'</p>

<p>'I do not wish to be hard upon you,' said Phil, with a slight
feeling of compunction. 'Neither did I seek this information.
Still, I am satisfied.'</p>

<p>Du Maurier watched his rival as he turned away. His long thin
fingers were tightly clenched, the cigarette in his mouth was
crushed between the even white teeth in silent impotent consuming
rage.</p>

<p>'<i>Ma foi</i>, but it is a fine thing to be one of these
English aristocrats,' he said with a deep respiration. 'So cool, so
contemptuous! I would give all I possess to have my gentleman on a
nice level strip of turf with twelve paces between us. Still, I
have my little revenge. La belle Rashleigh is proud; her
self-respect is wounded. If it is not Horace Du Maurier, it will
never be M'sieu Decie.&mdash;Ah! if it had not been for those
bills!'</p>

<p>The dark scowl upon the Frenchman's face gradually changed to a
sour smile. He rejoiced in a cat-like nature, only capable of those
petty meannesses which make up the <i>summum bonum</i> of some
men's lives. He looked at his watch, and finding it close upon
twelve, set out with apparent determination of purpose across the
fields. As he came into the high-road at some distance beyond,
there was another individual awaiting him&mdash;Gerard Rashleigh.
From the expression of the young undergraduate's face, the
interview was neither self-sought nor pleasing.</p>

<p>'Ah, I thought you would not keep me waiting,' said Du Maurier.
'One cannot be too careful in a house like Pencraig, where no place
is sacred against intrusion.&mdash;In one word, have you the
money?'</p>

<p>'Money? Where can I get it from? It was only yesterday morning
that you promised me another month.'</p>

<p>'Possibly, dear boy; only, this is a case what you call Hobson's
choice. Many things have happened since yesterday. Your friend
Decie&mdash;to put it plainly&mdash;insists upon my leaving
Pencraig to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'You don't mean that!' Rashleigh exclaimed, every vestige of
colour gone from his cheeks. 'Under the circumstances he would not
dare'&mdash;</p>

<p>'He has dared, all the same; and I shall have to obey. See how
one suffers for the little indiscretions of youth. It's hard upon
me.'</p>

<p>'What particular rascality has Decie got hold of?' Rashleigh
asked bluntly.</p>

<p>'I do not like that word, sir, and I will ask you to be careful.
Still, as the poet says, <i>Arcades ambo</i>'&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Id est</i>&mdash;blackguards both,' Rashleigh
finished.&mdash;'Oh, why be nice about expressions, particularly
when they are true! I wish to heaven I had never seen you. I
wish&mdash;But what is the use of wishing? I am anxious to pay you
this money; but I haven't got it, and that's the long and short of
it. Some day, I shall make a clean breast of the whole thing.'</p>

<p>But Du Maurier was too familiar with these transient fits of
repentance to be seriously alarmed; he merely laughed again and
lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>'It will be a black day for you when you defy me,' said he. 'You
and I sink or swim together. If you wish to return to your
buttercups and daisies, I shall not hinder you. Pay me four hundred
pounds and you are free.'</p>

<p>'I haven't four hundred pence,' Rashleigh replied doggedly.</p>

<p>'Perhaps not; but I will show you how to get it. Let us take a
long walk; it will soothe your nerves and clear your brain. And
besides, I am going to show you the way to rid yourself of Horace
Du Maurier, who, after all, is no greater scamp than you; only, he
has the pluck, and you are a coward.'</p>

<p>The complacent hostess of Pencraig, who had not joined the Ross
excursion, saw no objection to Decie's proposal for the afternoon.
It was not often that the good lady had a long afternoon in peace,
and the chronicles of the <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i> were of
overpowering interest.</p>

<p>'My dear child, so long as you come home alive, you may do just
what you please,' she said. 'Phil was always most trustworthy, even
as a boy, and I am sure you will be safe with him.'</p>

<p>There was not a ripple on the water as the little craft left the
landing-stage and took its way up-stream. Miss Edith sat with the
crimson tiller-ropes over her shoulders, looking over the shining
river before her from under the shade of a smart sailor hat with a
truly nautical air. It was so quiet and pleasant there beneath the
overhanging willows, and along through cool sombre shades cast by
the trees in the sloping woods. There was just the rhythmic throb
of sculls in the rowlocks, with tiny pools left by the sweeping
blades.</p>

<p>'Now, don't you feel just as happy as if you had gone with the
others?' asked Phil, when a mile or two had been covered. 'Probably
by this time they are all hot and tired, and heartily wishing they
had never met.'</p>

<p>'That is a slightly egotistical remark, Phil,' the fair coxswain
observed; 'and I shall not pay you the compliment of replying.
Besides, it is all very well to console yourself with sarcastic
remarks, when you know that, under more favourable circumstances, I
might have proved another Mariana of the Moated Grange for all you
cared.'</p>

<p>'Um! A season in town hasn't improved you,' said Phil gravely.
'That's the worst of taking too much notice of very young ladies,
they get so flippant.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but it isn't original,' said Edith serenely. 'I overheard
much the same remark made in a London drawing-room one night; and
the answer struck me as being so appropriate, that I remembered
it&mdash;which is very creditable, and not a little risky, for I
haven't the remotest notion who Mariana is.'</p>

<p>'Put it clown to Tennyson or Shakespeare; it's sure to be one or
the other.&mdash;Pull the left-hand string; we shall be on the
gravel in a minute.'</p>

<p>They had reached a broad bend in the river, where the stream
widened, with low sloping meadows upon the one bank, and an
eminence&mdash;upon which is situated the village of
Hoarwithy&mdash;upon the other. At this point the stream takes a
peculiar V shape, and is particularly puzzling to the amateur
oarsman. Decie, pulling round sharply to miss the foreshore, struck
the blade against a solid mass of rock and snapped it nearly off
below the button.</p>

<p>'This is a pleasant thing,' he exclaimed ruefully.&mdash;'Will
you get out and wait till the damage can be repaired, or stay
here!'</p>

<p>Miss Edith treated this proposal with the scorn it merited.</p>

<p>'Get out? Certainly not.&mdash;There is at least four yards of
mud between me and dry land.&mdash;No; you shall row me under that
delightful shady alder, and fasten up. I don't suppose there will
be any danger of my being spirited away till you return.'</p>

<p>Making the best of his broken implements, Decie succeeded at
length in reaching the desired haven; and having fastened the
dingey securely, scrambled up the bank with the fractured blade,
though not without detriment to his spotless flannels, in search of
the handy man, without which no village is complete. This
individual, a bluff old fisherman in blue Guernsey frock and ducks,
who combined the office of postman, publican, and carpenter to the
village, expressed a cheery opinion of the damage.</p>

<p>'I can splice it as good as new in half an hour, your honour,'
said he. 'You'd better step inside. And if you'll ask for the
"strawberry Norman," you'll get as good a glass of cider as a man
need wish to drink.'</p>

<p>As Phil knew both the man and his cider by reputation, he had no
hesitation in taking the hint, though it is not always advisable to
accept a west-countryman's dogmatic opinion upon this patriotic
subject on every occasion. As Decie stood in the little bar alone,
he was not a little astonished to hear from the room beyond, the
door of which was only partially closed, the familiar voices of Du
Maurier and Gerard Rashleigh. He was still more surprised to hear
his own name so frequently mentioned.</p>

<p>'It's a blackguard thing to do,' Rashleigh exclaimed. 'I have
done him harm enough already. I tell you I won't do it.'</p>

<p>'Not so loud: you don't want the whole parish to hear,' came the
smooth seductive tones of the Frenchman. 'Surely, you would not
scruple at such a little thing, after what you have already
done.&mdash;Ah, that little yellow ticket was a masterpiece; a
smooth touch so artful that it looked like nature itself. Now that
Miss Rashleigh is convinced her lover is a thief'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Leave my sister out of it altogether,' Rashleigh exclaimed
passionately. 'I tell you I won't have it. If it wasn't that I was
afraid of you, I would tell Decie everything.&mdash;Why do you
tempt me? It can do you no good.'</p>

<p>It will give me revenge. But you have your alternative. To use
one of your sweet insular phrases, the borrower is always the
servant of the lender. Pay me what money you owe me, and my power
is gone.'</p>

<p>'Would to heaven I could! There would be no hesitation
then.'</p>

<p>'Decie would be delighted to accommodate you,' sneered Du
Maurier. 'The paltry hundreds would be cheerfully paid, if you only
cared to exercise this new and interesting fit of honesty. Why not
ask him?'</p>

<p>'Because I have done him too much harm already. Because, if you
must know, I am in his debt now. That bracelet affair'&mdash;</p>

<p>Decie, conscious for the first time that he was playing the part
of an eavesdropper, stayed to hear no more. His face was very stern
and set as he paid for the repair of the blade, and passed down the
garden path with a curt 'Good afternoon' to the village genius.</p>

<p>'Seems as if he was upset,' remarked that worthy, 'and him so
affable and perlite at first. Maybe missis ha' given he the "red
streak" by mistake.'</p>

<p>For some minutes the boat was propelled towards Pencraig in
silence. Miss Edith regarded her companion demurely from the
unclouded serenity of her gray eyes.</p>

<p>'You are looking very amiable,' she observed in the sweetest
tones. 'You must have heard some particularly good news; that is,
if your hurry to get back is any criterion.'</p>

<p>'Do I look amiable?' said Decie with an effort&mdash;'more
amiable than usual? I have heard something; but whether it is good
or bad, for the life of me I can't tell.'</p>

<p>And with this enigmatic remark Miss Edith was fain to be
content.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">THE picnic party returned in time for dinner, much to Mr
Frederick Denton's outward and visible joy. Trevor, being younger,
and as yet no admirer of the <i>nil admirari</i> school, expressed
the opinion that they had had a particularly jolly day&mdash;a view
fully endorsed by the sisters Moffat. There was sufficient time to
change flannels and boating jackets for gray tweed and demi-toilet
before the first warning of that 'tocsin of the soul, the
dinner-bell,' though Horace Du Maurier made a point of appearing in
all the glory of evening dress, with tiny diamond studs in his
ample bosom, and moustache waxed to a pitch of perfection only
acquired by long and constant practice.</p>

<p>During the progress of the meal, that prepossessing gentleman
was unusually brilliant and vivacious. 'It is a fortunate thing
that we do not dwell in the palace of truth,' Decie murmured under
his breath, as he noted the many-sided facets of the Frenchman's
nature. It would have considerably astonished the unsuspecting
guests, had they known that under this dazzling display, this
outward appearance of gaiety, Du Maurier was racking his versatile
brain to discover some means of escape from the dilemma in which he
was placed. Even the most wily adventurer cannot hope to keep up
the necessary show without a certain amount of ready-money.</p>

<p>'What have you been doing all day?' asked the Colonel,
addressing Decie during a pause in the conversation.&mdash;'Ah! you
missed a treat, my boy. I never saw Symonds Yat looking more
beautiful.'</p>

<p>Phil explained. He detailed the account of the accident,
Rashleigh listening intently the while, wondering, with the
tormenting conscience of a coward, if the speaker could possibly
have overheard part of his conversation with Du Manlier. As he
looked up, his glance encountered Decie's. There was something in
the look that caused him to grow cold, and his glass to clink
against his teeth with a sudden spasm of fear.</p>

<p>'Beautiful old church,' Denton struck in opportunely,
'especially interesting, as we are all such critical judges of
architecture.&mdash;I assure you, Miss Rashleigh, I never saw
anything more curious than that tree&mdash;an elm in full leaf,
actually growing inside the church. A most peculiar sight.'</p>

<p>Any further discussion upon this uncommon but nevertheless
visible phenomenon was cut short by the exit of the ladies. Colonel
Scobell pushed a silver cigarette box round the table and rang the
bell for more claret. In two of the Oxford' men, both fishing
enthusiasts, he had discovered a pair of ready listeners, to whom
he was detailing the account of a wonderful fish, caught by foul
hooking a cast left in the salmon's gills by an angler, who had
been broken by the same finny monster on the previous day.</p>

<p>'These fishermen beat any other sportsmen out of sight,' Trevor
murmured.&mdash;'Did you hear that Phil? Come into the
drawing-room.'</p>

<p>'Presently. Not that there is any particular reason why you
should wait for me. I want to speak to Rashleigh a moment.'</p>

<p>Horace Du Maurier had disappeared. Rashleigh remained smoking
feverishly, and paying more attention to the claret jug than was
good for him or his nerves, as weak-minded men in the hour of
trouble or anxiety will do. As Phil touched him suddenly on the
shoulder, he started with something in his heart akin to
terror.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' he asked a little defiantly, and
instinctively upon his guard against some invisible though not
unexpected danger.</p>

<p>'Come and play a game of billiards,' Decie replied. These signs
of Rashleigh's perturbation were not lost upon him. 'We shall be
sure to have the room to ourselves.'</p>

<p>Rashleigh obeyed reluctantly, and together they crossed the hall
Once in the room, Decie closed the door; and turning up the lamps,
chose himself a cue, and without further preamble, commenced the
play. Rashleigh, though by no means an inferior player, was no
match for Decie, though usually he was far the more scientific
exponent of that fascinating game.</p>

<p>'You have something on your mind,' Decie observed, executing a
brilliant cannon.&mdash;'Not a bad shot that. I'll tell you what I
will do. Two to one in half-crowns I pot the red and tell you what
you are thinking about.'</p>

<p>'You would lose,' Rashleigh laughed recklessly.&mdash;'Ah!
missed the red.&mdash;The other shot of yours would be about as
successful.'</p>

<p>'By no means. Let me finish. You are at your wits' end to know
where to find that money you owe Du Maurier. And further, you would
like to tell me something, if you only dared.'</p>

<p>'How on earth did you know I owed Du Manlier anything?'
Rashleigh exclaimed, off his guard. 'He told me no one knew but
ourselves.'</p>

<p>'I do know, and you can't deny it. I would rather be under an
obligation to my bitterest enemy than to that man. What do you owe
him? I am not asking out of idle curiosity.'</p>

<p>'What do I owe him? Well, really I cannot quite say, there are
so many transactions. Perhaps eighty or ninety pounds
altogether.'</p>

<p>Decie spotted the red which his antagonist had potted. He seemed
to have forgotten his previous curiosity in his new and revived
interest in the game. Still, there was a grim dryness in his voice
and manner that puzzled Rashleigh, and for which he was utterly at
a loss to account.</p>

<p>'I do not wish to pry into your affairs,' Decie remarked at
length. 'But you might just as well own the truth. You owe Du
Maurier four hundred&mdash;money he has swindled you out of at
cards, I presume. What possessed you to take up with a common
blackleg like that?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Rashleigh replied, his face aflame.&mdash;'I've
been an awful fool, Decie.'</p>

<p>'If I don't make a mistake, you've been something worse,' Decie
put in <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>'Well, I have. And now the murder is out. I daresay you know we
are both members of <i>The Lotos</i>&mdash;the gambling club in
H&mdash;&mdash; Street. I am quite in Du Manner's power. He has
only got to carry out his threat and post me as a defaulter. I
couldn't face Cambridge after that.&mdash;Decie, I am the most
miserable wretch under the sun!'</p>

<p>The unhappy boy threw his cue aside, and falling across the
table with his face buried in his hands, sobbed aloud. He was not
naturally bad, only weak and easily led into temptation, like many
another lad wandering amongst the traps and pitfalls of university
life.</p>

<p>Phil laid a hand upon the other's shoulder, speaking not
unkindly.</p>

<p>'I think I can help you,' he said. 'I don't want to force your
confidence; only, at the same time I have not the smallest
intention of paying Du Maurier any sum he chooses to demand. And I
don't want him to know I have a hand in this. I haven't much money
with me&mdash;not quite a hundred pounds&mdash;but I can make up
that sum. Offer him that, and he will jump at it.'</p>

<p>'Not he,' Rashleigh returned mournfully. 'He holds my paper to
the amount of four hundred. You don't know him as I do.'</p>

<p>'Fortunately, I don't. I know him a great deal better&mdash;or
worse,' said Phil dryly. 'I have an idea he will take it. Make the
offer as if you meant it, and be a man for once. You shall have the
money now, if you like. By good luck, I happen to have so much with
me. And one word in conclusion. If he turns restive, just remark
that Selby is of opinion that he is uncommonly lucky to get
that.'</p>

<p>Hope springing eternal in the human breast, gave Rashleigh a
momentary feeling of elation. But he was too much under the
Frenchman's sinister influence to shake off the bondage as a bolder
spirit would have done. He stood, inspired alternately by joy and
fear, till Decie returned. He had in his hand a crisp roll of
banknotes, which he placed in Rashleigh's hand.</p>

<p>'There!' he exclaimed hurriedly. 'I have just seen Du Maurier,
who is inquiring for you.&mdash;Now is your time. If you have any
lingering traces of manliness, show a bold front, and the victory
is yours.'</p>

<p>Decie had barely time to leave the room before Du Manlier
entered. He seemed a trifle pale and agitated, now that he was
alone with his fellow-conspirator and the mask had fallen from his
face.</p>

<p>'I am fortunate in finding you here,' he said. 'We must forget
our little difference this afternoon in face of the common
danger.&mdash;See, my dear Gerard; the situation grows critical. I,
even I, am puzzled. I must get away from here to-morrow; and how to
raise the wind, as you call it, I do not know. I am reluctantly
compelled to look to you, <i>mom cher</i>.'</p>

<p>'Supposing, by a lucky accident I am able to accommodate you. If
I was to say to you: "Du Maurier, here is a hundred pounds in hard
cash," what advantage am I to have in return?'</p>

<p>'Advantage! The boy is mad. It is not for you to make terms with
me. I shall teach you to kick over the traces! Bah! why these
theatricals?'</p>

<p>Rashleigh braced himself for the coming trial. The possession of
money to silence his tormentor's tongue gave him a new and sweet
sense of power.</p>

<p>'I will be perfectly candid with you,' he said. 'Give me my
paper, and in return I will hand you a hundred pounds. It is a fair
bargain. You are driven into a corner, and I can help you out.
<i>You</i> know how those <i>IOU's</i> were obtained. I will not
discuss that. Take my terms, or leave them.'</p>

<p><i>'Par dieu,</i> I shall do nothing of the sort. You shall give
me the money, and trust to my honour to give you further time to
pay the balance.'</p>

<p>'Rather a frail reed to rest upon,' said Rashleigh with a
reckless laugh. 'Nonsense, Du Maurier. It is I to make terms; and,
honestly speaking, I don't owe you anything. I think I am dealing
very liberally with you&mdash;an opinion shared by more than one;
indeed, Selby&mdash;you remember Selby?&mdash;says you are
uncommonly lucky to get that.'</p>

<p>During this interesting conversation, Decie had remained in the
hall to watch the progress of events; not that he anticipated
failure upon Rashleigh's part, but that he was genuinely anxious
that the lad should himself throw off the fetters which bound him.
Failure was impossible, as Phil very well knew, so long as he had
the whip-hand of the versatile Du Maurier. Still, if Rashleigh
could assert his own independence unaided, it would be a great step
towards a speedy regeneration.</p>

<p>While Phil was still pacing the hall, turning over these
thoughts in his mind, a light footstep descending the stairs
attracted his attention; and though there was only a dim light
burning, he was enabled to distinguish the face and figure of
Beatrice Rashleigh. There was a restless, troubled look in her
eyes; but the face grew a trifle colder as she recognised
Decie.</p>

<p>'Why did you not come with us to-day?' she asked. 'Oh, surely
you must have misunderstood me. I do not wish to make your visit
unpleasant.'</p>

<p>'Please set your mind at rest upon that score. My excuse was
really no idle one; and so far as regretting the day's pleasure, my
decision promises to be one of the most fortunate things I ever did
in my life.'</p>

<p>Beatrice looked up surprised at the quiet ring of triumph in the
words. She felt an irresistible impulse to remain with him, yet at
the same time, woman-like, she blamed herself for this weakness.
Like the moth fluttering round the flame, she could not keep from
the dangerous lure.</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear it,' said Beatrice with a little sigh. 'Would
you mind telling me where Gerard is? I suppose I may go into the
billiard-room?'</p>

<p>'Well, I&mdash;I think I would wait a moment. He is in there
with Du Maurier, only I fancy they are talking over some private
business.'</p>

<p>Beatrice laughed lightly, the first sign of mirth Phil had
noticed since they met, and crossed over to the billiard-room with
a determined step. Regardless of Decie's entreaties, which only
served to increase her resolution, she threw open the door and took
a step inside. One glance was quite enough. Du Maurier, his face
flaming with passion, stood facing Rashleigh, the latter very white
and agitated, but presenting a picture of quiet determination. So
engrossed were they in their quarrel, that they were quite
oblivious to the presence of the deeply interested spectators.</p>

<p>'Then what follows?' Du Maurier hissed through his clenched
teeth. 'I go to M'sieu Decie and say to him I know who stole that
bracelet. Can you guess?&mdash;No.&mdash;Then I will tell you.
Rashleigh was the thief!'</p>

<p>'And what would he say?' Rashleigh returned unsteadily. 'He
would simply tell you that he had known it all along. He has known
it from the first.'</p>

<p>'Ah! <i>you</i> say so. And the little episode of the watch? The
Philip Reid who raises money on his valuables'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Which was pledged for me. I was driven almost mad for the want
of a little money. Decie was not the rich man then he is now. It
was for me alone that money was obtained. It was to prevent my
sister knowing what a miserable criminal I am, that caused Decie to
sacrifice his happiness.&mdash;And now, do your worst.'</p>

<p>Decie, the first to recover himself, drew Beatrice back and
closed the door unseen. Her face was white as marble, her limbs
trembled under her; she would have fallen had he not put his arm
round her. As their eyes met, hers soft, sorrowful, and pleading,
his smiling tenderly, she found sufficient voice to speak:</p>

<p>'O Phil, what have I done to you? What a miserable girl I am!
And to think that he&mdash;Gerard&mdash;Let me go. I cannot, dare
not speak to you yet.'</p>

<p>With a fierce gesture of passionate <i>abandon</i>, she broke
from the shelter of his arms and flew up-stairs with the speed of a
hunted deer. Phil followed her with his eyes, shining with love and
triumph, a feeling of wild exultation at his heart. Then, without
further ceremony, he opened the billiard-room door and strode in
with set determination of purpose.</p>

<p>'You need not go over that miserable business again,' he said,
seeing that the Frenchman was about to speak. 'You seem to have
lost your philosophic calm. I know everything you would say; but I
think you will preserve that secret. Now listen to me. You will
retire to your room without seeing any one tonight, and write a
letter to Colonel Scobell saying that you are bound to leave by the
8.10 train to-morrow. You will also give Rashleigh the securities
you hold. Nothing more need be said.'</p>

<p>'I have them already,' Rashleigh explained. 'As to the
rest'&mdash;</p>

<p>'As to the rest, we shall meet again in Cambridge,' Du Maurier
exclaimed. 'Then we shall see'&mdash;</p>

<p>'You will do nothing of the kind, for the simple reason that you
will not return to that happy hunting-ground, where there are too
many of your class already. You will take your name off the college
books.'</p>

<p>'And if I refuse?'</p>

<p>'Refuse! You dare not!' Decie cried contemptuously. 'You have
your money. Go, or I shall be tempted to give you the chastisement
you deserve.'</p>

<p>With a gesture of impotent rage and one backward look of hatred,
the baffled swindler left them. It was the last time either of them
was ever to see Horace Du Maurier. When morning came, the
gentlemanly chevalier had disappeared, leaving no trace and no
regret behind.</p>

<p>Phil turned to Gerard Rashleigh, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>'I congratulate you heartily. You have done a wise thing,
Gerard. It will be your own fault if you don't go straight from
now. Let as say no more about it. The rest lies in your own
hands.'</p>

<p>'There is one thing to be done,' Rashleigh returned, a new light
in his eyes. 'Do not be too hard upon me, Phil. I will make the
best atonement I can. Will you leave me for a moment to recover
myself? I am quite unmanned.'</p>

<p>With a delicate innate sympathy, always so ready to measure the
feeling of others, Decie left him, and passing through the open
French window, stepped on to the tennis lawn. It was cool and quiet
there under the cedars, bathed in the peaceful moonlight, the
silence of night broken only by the occasional ripple of laughter
from the drawing-room. Decie for the moment felt a need for silence
and solitude, a peacefulness broken all too soon by the appearance
of Rashleigh, and with him a figure that caused Phil's heart to
give a quick leap and stop as if it were still.</p>

<p>'I have been telling her,' Rashleigh said abruptly.</p>

<p>Decie smiled and held out his hand. Beatrice stretched out both
of hers with an impulse of mingled pity and sorrow. As Phil held
the fluttering fingers in a firm grasp, he turned to hear what the
penitent would say.</p>

<p>I will not make any excuses,' he continued in a faltering
unsteady voice. 'I&mdash;I took the bracelet, and Phil saw me. On
my life, I had no idea that he would be suspected, or I would have
cut off my right hand first.&mdash;But even when yon were so
foolish, Beatrice, he would not speak; he did not care for you to
know how bad I was. Then Du Maurier got the whole thing out of me:
the name I used, even the whole story how Phil pledged his watch to
lend me money. Finally, he succeeded in obtaining the ticket. What
use he made of it, you know better than I&mdash;You see I used the
same name that Phil assumed, and so there was something suspicious
about the whole thing.&mdash;Do not ask me to say any
more&mdash;Forgive me if you can; to forget is
impossible&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, we will try,' said Phil cheerfully. 'Only, do not
elevate me to the rank of a guardian angel, when I have only been
selfishly playing for my own hand. Yon presentiment is quite right.
I overheard your conversation yesterday, or how should I have
known?&mdash;But there; we will say no more about it. Shake hands,
old fellow; and repay me, if you owe me anything, by doing the same
for some one else in due season.'</p>

<p>Rashleigh put out his hand silently, for he could not trust
himself to speak. Beatrice freed her fingers from Decie's warm
grasp, and throwing her arms round her brother's neck, kissed him.
He turned and walked away in the broad moonlight, slowly,
thoughtfully; but there was a higher carriage of the head, a more
elastic step, and a new warm feeling of unaccustomed lightness and
freedom glowing in his breast.</p>

<p>'Phil, you have done a very noble thing!' Beatrice murmured at
length. 'Will you crown it by forgiving me for my sinful
folly?'</p>

<p>He passed his arm round her and drew her face close to his. For
a time there was a long delicious silence as he looked into her
troubled eyes. With all a woman's sweet hypocrisy, she asked for a
favour she already had, but the sense of her self-humiliation was
not the less precious for that knowledge.</p>

<p>'My darling, I am too happy to feel any soreness at present I
have found you again; that is enough for me. I daresay I ought to
have been stern and haughty; to have taken my revenge and left you.
But I am only human, and I shall love you all the days of my
life.'</p>

<p>By-and-by others of the party wandered out into the perfect
evening, strolling in the moonlight in twos and threes; but, with a
certain electric sympathy, they kept at a little distance from the
lovers. Presently, Miss Edith, with a white boating cap perched
upon her fair head, passed by, and leaving her companion for a
moment, tripped lightly across the lawn.</p>

<p>'It was not bad news, then?' she asked demurely.</p>

<p>'No, indeed,' replied Phil gaily; 'the very best in the world. I
said you should be the first to know; but mind, it is a profound
secret for the present. Though how long it will remain so,' the
speaker continued, 'is quite another thing. Anyway, it's nothing to
be ashamed of.'</p>

<p>'Ashamed of!' Beatrice echoed indignantly.&mdash;'Phil, I
believe I am the happiest girl in the world!'</p>
