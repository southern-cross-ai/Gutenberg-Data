<b><i>Elizabeth Duchess of Hamilton and Argyle nee
Gunning</i></b></p>
<hr>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The aim of these stories is not historical exactitude nor
unbending accuracy in dates or juxtaposition. They are rather an
attempt to re-create the personalities of a succession of charming
women, ranging from Elizabeth Pepys, wife of the Diarist, to Fanny
Burney and her experiences at the Court of Queen Charlotte. As I
have imagined them, so I have set them forth, and if what is
written can at all revive their perished grace and the unfading
delight of days that now belong to the ages, and to men no more, I
shall not have failed. Much is imagination, more is truth, but
which is which I scarcely can tell myself. I have wished to set
them in other circumstances than those we know.</p>
<p>What would Elizabeth Pepys have felt if she had read the secrets
of the Diary? If Stella and Vanessa had met&mdash;Ah, that is a
tenderness and terror almost beyond all thinking! How would my Lady
Mary's smarting pride have blistered herself and others if the
Fleet marriage of her eccentric son&mdash;whose wife she never
saw&mdash;had actually come between the wind and her nobility? Was
there no finer, more ethereal touch in Elizabeth Gunning's stolen
marriage with her Duke than is recorded in Horace Walpole's
malicious gossip? Could such beauty have been utterly sordid? What
were the fears and hopes of the lovely Maria Walpole as, after long
concealment of her marriage, she trembled on the steps of a throne?
How did those about her judge of Fanny Burney in the Digby affair?
Did she wholly conceal her heart? From her Diary we know what she
wished to feel&mdash;very certainly not entirely what she felt.</p>
<p>Perhaps of all these women we know best that Elizabeth who never
lived&mdash;Elizabeth Bennet. She is the most real because her
inner being is laid open to us by her great creator. I have not
dared to touch her save as a shadow picture in the background of
the quiet English country-life which now is gone for ever. But her
fragrance&mdash;stimulating rather than sweet, like lavender and
rosemary&mdash;could not be forgotten in any picture of the late
eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries and among the women whom
all the world remembers. They, one and all, can only move in
dreamland now. Their lives are but stories in a printed book, and a
heroine of Jane Austen's is as real as Stella or the fair Walpole.
So I apologise for nothing. I have dreamed. I may hope that others
will dream with me.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>I. THE DIURNAL OF MRS ELIZABETH
PEPYS</h2>
<h3>Elizabeth Pepys&mdash;1640-1669</h3>
<p>"So home to dinner with my wife, very pleasant and pleased with
one another's company, and in our general enjoyment one of another,
better we think than most other couples do."</p>
<p>Elizabeth St. Michel, daughter of a French Huguenot, was fifteen
when Pepys married her. She was only twenty-nine when she died.
Pepys himself at their marriage was twenty-two. It is the
skirmishing of young folk that he describes when he reports such
animated scenes as the occasion when his wife threatened him with
the red-hot tongs. They had their brisk encounters and their
affectionate interludes as well, when "very merry we were with our
pasty, well-baked, and a good dish of roasted chickens; pease,
lobsters, strawberries."</p>
<p>In odd moments, Pepys applied himself to his wife's education.
Dismissing her dancing-master by reason of jealousy, he began
instead a course in Arithmetic. He himself taught her Addition,
Subtraction, and the Multiplication Tables; but, says he, "I
purpose not to trouble her yet with Division, but to begin with the
Globes to her now."</p>
<p>At her early death he mourned sincerely, and erected a memorial
celebrating the accomplished charms of Elizabeth, his
wife,&mdash;</p>
<p>"FORMA, ARTIBUS, LINGUIS CULTISSIMA."</p>
<p align="center"><a name="x00003-2" id="x00003-2"></a><img alt=""

<b><i>Mrs Pepys as St. Katharine</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p>2d <i>May</i>.&mdash;Sam'l now in great honour at the Navy
Office, whereat my heart do rejoice, and the less for the havings,
which do daily increase, than that I would willingly see him
worshipfully received, the which indeede his hard work do
plentifully deserve, he sparing himselfe in nothing for the
advancing of his busyness.</p>
<p>And I do reason with myselfe that though he have faults many and
great (which God knowes is true) yet he do come up in the world and
our gettings are very good and do daily increase. How they go I
know not, for that little and grudging is spent on my clothes, and
though Sam'l goes very noble still it is not possible but much is
saved, though he do lament himself in very high wordes of our
spendthrift way of life and small saving.</p>
<p>But of this more anon.</p>
<p>Up and dressed a pease pudding with boyled rabbets and bacon to
dinner for want of a cook-mayde, Sarah leaving us at dawn, and he
loving it mightily. The which he should not have this day but that
I have a month's mind to a slashte wastcote which hitherto he hath
soured upon. This done, a brave dish of cream in the which he takes
great delight; and so seeing him in Tune I to lament the ill wear
of my velvet wastcote as desiring a Better, whereon he soured. We
jangling mightily on this I did object his new Jackanapes coat with
silver buttons, but to no purpose. He reading in the Passionate
Pillgrim which he do of all things love. But angry to prayers and
to Bed.</p>
<p>But it is observable that this day I discover Sam'l in the
keeping of a Journal and very secret in this, and come at it I
will, he being much abroad on his occasions the while I sit at
home.</p>
<p>3d.&mdash;This day awakes Sam'l in a musty humour as much
over-served with meat and Drink, and in great discontent calling
me, do bid me rise and fetch his Pills that olde Mother Wigsworth
did give him at Brampton. I merry and named him the Passionate
Pillgrim from his love to these, whereupon he flings the Pills in
my face and all scattered, Deb grudging to gather them it being
Lord's Day. So I to churche, leaving him singing and playing
"Beauty, Retire" to his Viall, a song not worthy to be sung on a
holy Day however he do conceit his skill therein. His brown beauty
Mrs Lethulier in the pew against us and I do perceive her turn her
Eye to see if Sam'l do come after. She very brave in hanging
sleeves, yet an ill-lookt jade if one do but consider, but with the
seeking Eye that men look to, and Sam'l in especial. Fried Loyne of
mutton to dinner, and Sam'l his head akeing I did sit beside him
discoursing of the new hangings for the small closet, wherein great
pleasure for it will be most neat and fine. And great content have
we in such discourse and in our house and the good we are come
to.</p>
<p>4th.&mdash;This day do Sam'l speak handsomely enough of his
humour yesterday, charging it upon the Rabbets, and so I left it.
And strange it is how when he do so repent my heart do take part
with him though I would better renounce him awhile to learn him
manners. So he to the Exchange and buys me a piece of Paragon to a
pettycote, and though it be not what I would have of my own
choosing yet I do receive it with many goode words as hoping all
will yet be as I desire. So to sup on a good dish of beef
<i>a la mode</i>, and he well content, it appearing
he have this day bestowed upon himself at the Exchange a good
Theorbo, four Bookes, and a payre of Globes, talking very high how
these be for my instruction rather than his own liking. The which I
receive smyling, but do think&mdash;Lord! what fools men be that
will have a woman so lightly deceived, fine wordes buttering no
parsnips. Sure they be but Children when all said and done, and
their Innocency in this a pleasant thing to see.</p>
<p>Comes Mr Collins with his new Wife, a pretty well-shaped Woman
with black hayre and Eyes, and she, much cried up for her skill on
the Theorbo, do after play a Lesson upon it, but very ill, and
pretty to see Sam'l that was hoping great things (loving musique)
in pain and grief to hear her mean false playing and yet making
fine wordes of it to please her, and they gone, do call her slut
and baggage and I know not what all. So to prayers and bed.</p>
<p>5th.&mdash;Sam'l this day reading over his vows not to drink
strong waters or wines nor yet go to the play for two weekes. But I
do ask myself (though not Sam'l) whether these vows be convenient.
For I do surely think he do it only because it is the greater
pleasure to drink and see the play, it being thus forbid. And in
Saml' it is to be noted and methinks in other Men also that they do
suck more pleasure from a thing forbidden and hard to come at than
from the same thing when comely and convenient to be done in the
sight of all. This day, he being with his Lordship, I to gain a
sight of his Journal, he carelessly leaving it about, but took
nothing by my pains, it being writ in secret writing, which do
plainly show it to be what he would be shamed if known. Whereas
mine owne is voide of all offence, and I do lay it under the smocks
in the great armoire only because it is not seemly that Sam'l
should know my thoughts, I having to deal with him as best I may.
<i>Mem</i>. To ask of Mrs Jemimah Crosby if her father, being a
scrivener, knoweth and can instruct in secret writings.</p>
<p>Sam'l home late this day, and the supper, a calve's head, very
good, with a noble Barell of oysters, he bringing with him Mr S.
Lucy, and so supt very merry, and after in the garden, Sam'l to
play on his flageolette, it being full moon. So to bed, omitting
prayers. A pleasant day and content together.</p>
<p>6th.&mdash;This day, seeing Mrs Jemimah Crosby, I to ask her
earnestly if her father the scrivener do teach the secret writing,
and she replying that so it was, I after the mayde's cleaning the
house, do forth and to his lodging behind Paternoster Row, he being
a worthy olde Gentleman with a long white bearde, very reverend. I
enjoining him to be secret, which he the more willingly promised
that I have obliged him and Mrs Jem with codiniac and quince
marmalett of my own making, do tell him how my father (which is
unknown to him) have documents and papers which he would willingly
decipher but for his bad Eyes. Wherein God forgive me, for his eyes
are the best Part of him. Olde Mr Crosby thereon urgent that my
father entrust him with the worke, but I sticking at the expense,
no more said. So I to show him a line of Dots and hooks which I did
copy from Sam'l his Journal, and he reading it with ease, what
should it prove to be but this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Took occasion to fall out with my wife very highly
about her ribbands being ill matcht and of two colours, and to very
high words, so that I did call her Beaste."</blockquote>
<p>So finding all as I thought and it being very needful that I
should know Sam'l his thoughts (and indeed he is very simple to
write them unless he think he have a fool to his wife) I do
covenant with the olde Gentleman for Lessons which are dear enough,
but to be paid from the housekeeping, and indeed the better that
Sam'l should live plaine awhile in consideration of his ailing. So
home in good time, and do find Sam'l and our she-cousin Scott very
merry with capping of Epitaphs and sayings, wherein I also
delighte. A very merry witty woman and harmlesse. Suppt on a
Westfalia Ham and so with prayers content to bed.</p>
<p>7th.&mdash;This day Sam'l returning from the Office takes me to
a fine collacion at Hamling's house, wherein the fine silver set
forth upon the table do give us great pleasure, but I a little
shamed because the ladies so brave, Mrs Hamling very Rich in an
embroidered suit, and Mrs Pegg Penn in flowered sattin, which God
knows she do not become, and heads set out with the new French
frizzle. I very plain in my olde black silk new-laced all over with
black silk gimp, Sam'l declaring I am very pretty in this, but I
trust him not herein, he willing to save his Purse. One passage of
Sam'l kissing the little black beauty, Mrs Deakin, that he do call
his Morena, displeased me, she being known for a frolicsome jade.
He later singing, "Gaze not on Swans," and "Goe and be
Hanged&mdash;that's Good-bye," all did applaud, and great mirth. It
was observable that Captain Wade, kissing me on parting, did a
little detain my Hand, and for this Sam'l did so betwit and becall
me, returning in the Coach, that I pretended sleep, which did put
him in a great discontent and so angry and without Prayers to bed.
Yet sure this shows his good liking to me, and I think his heart
sound, though he do Friske as I would he did not.</p>
<p>8th.&mdash;This day hear that my Lady Sandwich is Delivered of a
young Lady and all well. Sam'l thinking (on some jest of my Lord's)
to stand Godfather and give the name&mdash;though how to call the
Babe for him I see not&mdash;do at once provide silver Spoons and a
Porringer. Which, seeing he is not yet bidden, doth I confesse,
appear exceeding foolish and like a man that hath more silly pride
than sense, the rather that I lack a French mantle that he hath
promist but not performed. But I say nothing, according to the olde
wise saw of Goody Gorum,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Nothing say,<br>
But take your way.</blockquote>
<p>He this day in his new Cote of the fashion and half cloth
stockings going to give my Lord joy, do indeed seem very brave and
noble, and hath a neat legg, and it pleases me to see him go as he
should, for he is a personable man when well set out. And if he did
but consider how it is to his honour that his Wife should go as
fine as he I could the more rejoice therein, but it is not so, and
great dishonour it is to him to consider how this quarter he hath
spent fifty pounds on his clothes and but twelve on me, a thing not
fit to be said of him. But I wait my time.</p>
<p>10th.&mdash;This day Sam'l refuses me the French mantle as
beyond his Purse, but offers a payre of gloves&mdash;I refusing
this. Slipt out for Lesson, olde Mr Crosby being a worthy and
patient teacher, but it is a science very hard to be come at, and I
weary enough in the learning of it, though indeed it be so needful.
Still, some progress, and he saying merrily I would be at some
mischief in this, with love Letters or such Toys, do make me to
blush, so as I never did but when Sam'l was courting me. Yet no
guilty deed, but what is very fitting for a woman. Was instant with
the olde Gentleman that he should speake of my Lessons to none, the
more so (I did say) that my father would not have these papers
known to any, great matters hanging on it. Which indeed is true
though not as he takes it.</p>
<p>So I home and with Sam'l to the Play, where my Lady Castlemaine,
which indeed is a great Beauty, nor can I deny it, but sure it is
not hard to be a beauty in Clothes and jewels that do dazzle the
Eyes of all that Gaze upon her. But, Lord! to see how bold and
unmannerly in staring upon strangers and the men on the stage, and
in fine do not please me with her Freedoms. This Sam'l disputing
very hotly after we had supt upon a Jowl of Salmon, I to speake my
mind, asking if he would have his Wife casting oranges to the
actors and blowing Kisses all about the house, and he not knowing
what to answer, I do say, "Then prayse it not in others, for, if
you will have me a bold Slut, no doubt but I will do my endeavours
to please you," and so whiskte off, he sitting astonied. And
strange how men will like in otheres what in their own Wives they
love not but fear.</p>
<p>14th.&mdash;This day I by my Lady's desire to see the young Lady
which is a fine Babe and like to do well. But no word of Sam'l to
stand Godfather, and Sir J. Minnes and Lrd Brouncker spoke of,
which is no more than I thought, but will make Sam'l madd with his
spoones. But no loss herein if it do make him more biddable in
women's matters. Her La'ship observing that my Lutestring suit is
well worn and do me no credit, I did adventure to beseech her that
she would break a word with Sam'l on his next waiting upon her that
he would give me a Gown of Moyre which is now all the fashion, and
this, with many good words she promist very lovingly, desiring that
I would come in a weeks time to learn how she hath sped. So I home
in good Tune as knowing he oweth his duty to my Lord and Lady and
will be said by her. In comes fayre Mrs Margaret Wight to sup on a
dish of Eggs and butter of Sparagus that Sam'l hath ate with my
Lord Carlingford and do highly commend. And indeed it is rare meat.
After, we dancing and very merry with Mrs Margaret, and she gone, I
take occasion to tell Sam'l of the Godfathers like to stand for the
young Lady. Whereat he in a great Tosse, but I willing to smoothe
all betwixt him and my Lady do tell him the honourable words she
have spoke of him to myself and others, the more especially of his
Velvet suit with scarlet ribands. The which pleasing him, we fall
to discourse of what to do with the Spoons and Porringer, resolving
the spoons do go to Betty Michell where certayne it is I do stand
Godmother, and the Porringer to Mrs Lane, whose name I know not but
will come at shortly, and he do cry her up for a sober and
God-fearing woman. So pleasantly to bed and good frends.</p>
<p>16th.&mdash;This day comes my new cook-Mayd, Jane Gentleman, and
heaven send she prove worthy of her name, for I am drove almost
madd with mayds that are not mayds but Sluts and know not diligence
nor cleanliness, to their own undoing and mine. And strange it is
to consider how in the olden days before my mother and Grandmother
(who suffered great horroures from the like) the mayds were a
peaceable and diligent folk, going about their busyness to the
great content of all housewives. But now it is not so. And it is
only two days sennight that I coming suddenly in did find Sarah
with my new silk Hood upon her Frowsy head and Will discoursing
with her and thrumming upon Sam'l his viallin. Whereat I did catch
her a sound souse of the Ear, but she never a whit the better of it
and answering me so sawcily that we parted on it, Sam'l upholding
me in this, though it be hard enough to fill her place the wench
being a good Cooke-mayde, though sluttish.</p>
<p>20th.&mdash;Sam'l to visit my Lady, who receives him with great
content and satisfaction, though she railed bitterly at my Lord
that is so taken up with his pleasures and amusements that he goeth
not to Court as he should, and she fears will be passed over and
forgot for others that keep more stir. Requiring Sam'l that he
would deal plainly with my Lord on this, making known to him that
his Reputacion do hereby decay. But this methinks is a difficult
matter, and I do counsel Sam'l that he put not his finger between
the Bark and the Tree, lest it come by a shrewd squeeze, but let
rather my Lady deal with her Lord as a Wife should do. But he would
not harken, whereby I foresee trouble.</p>
<p>He then, pulling out of his pocket a little Packett, do say
pleasantly, "What, my Deare, shall you and I never go a-fairing
again? What think you I have here? And how many Kisses will you bid
me for a sight?"</p>
<p>Much merriment and pleasure from this, he holding it high, and I
leaping for it like a Dogg. At the last he opens it, and lo a fine
Lace of the new fashion for my bosom, and I do well perceive that
my Lady hath been at him, and am well content I did break the
matter to her, though an honest gown had been more to my Purpose.
Yet well begun is half done. Though but half, as Sam'l shall
find.</p>
<p>Our she-cousin Scott did visit me this day with sore complaints
of her husband's humours and constant drizzling, which is more than
a woman can or ought to bear. Therefore I should remember that with
Sam'l it is not so, but a spurt or flame of anger when he will be
very high with me, yet quickly snuft out and friends again. And
generally, it is noticeable, with some little gift for peacemaking,
so that I have more than once of set purpose Baited him to this
end. Yet not often. Considering therefore the husbands I do know, I
think Sam'l no worse a bargain than any and better than some, but
shall be better assured in this when I shall come at his Journal.
My seventh lesson today in the secret writing, and progress made,
but it do make my head ake extremely and were it not needful would
not continue on therein.</p>
<p>Comes this day my old Mayd Gosnell that Sam'l and I do call our
Marmotte, she telling me that Jane my mayde is naught and she hath
herself seen her abroade in light company. Yet cooking as she cooks
Sam'l sticks on this and bids me wink my eyes and observe nothing,
and such like are men!</p>
<p>21st.&mdash;This day Sam'l his feast for the recovery of his
ailment which he do always solemnly keep with great store of meat
and Drink and company. And this is a great day with him and a
troublous one with me, and to the Mayds also such as would madd a
Saint. Yet all said and done a noble Dinner, enough and to spare,
being a dish of Marrowbones, a legg of Mutton, a loin of Veal, a
dish of fowl, being three Pullets and 24 Larks all in a great dish,
a Tart, a neat's tongue, a dish of anchovies, a dish of Prawns and
cheese. His company seven men (Captain Fenner and both Sir Williams
among them) and seven women and all reasonable merry. But I
beseeching Sam'l privately to eat and Drink sparingly for the pain
in his Toe, he do so becall me that it was ten to an Ace that I did
hurle the Spit and the birds withal into the fire. Yet knowing he
would pay dear next day, I said the less and so continued on,
bidding him take his own way and pay for his liking. But indeed
great company and the Dinner well cooked and served and they did
drink my health on it. Also the house very handsome with Plate
displayed and fires where the Company did sit. And the greatness of
living we are come to did make Mrs Pierce's Mouth to water though
she in her flowered Lutestring and liking well of it. So she green
and yellow with spite as I did well perceive. Great Musique after,
with "Great, good and just," and Sam'l at the top of his Tune, and
so to cards and wine. Weary to bed, Sam'l starting up in the night
with Nightmare not knowing what he did, and did so shreeke and cry
that the Mayds in affright did run in, and the Watchmen passing
called to know was any poor Soul murthered within. But this no more
than my Expectation, and so quietly to sleep.</p>
<p>22d.&mdash;This day a noble gift of Plate being two Candelsticks
and a dish from Capt Salmon, he looking for favour from Sam'l
concerning the Henrietta shippe that he would have on next going to
Sea. Which do plainly prove to what honour and advancement we are
come to be so courted, and do gladde his heart and mine. Sat long
discoursing of this, and, turning the case, what should fall out
but a ring set with an Orient perle for me, which as not expecting
I received with great good will. Sam'l to the office and I to my
lesson wherein very diligent and commended of olde Mr Crosby, and
indeed I am come already to the reading of many wordes, yet not
glibbly. So home, but Sam'l coming home and I combing his hayre he
did say, "Who do I meet this day in Broade Street but olde Crosby,
Mrs Jem's father, that I did think long dead and buried, not having
seen him this year and more, and so to talk with him."</p>
<p>And, Lord! to see how I did redden, my heart so beating in my
bosom as I could have thought it would choak me, and do even sweat
in the writing of it. For sure it might well be the olde Gentleman
would think Sam'l did know all my father's business and speak
thereon. But I could not speak and my hand shaked so in the Combing
that I did drop the comb. And he continuing, "So I asked him how he
did and he answered, 'Bravely'; and more I would have said for it
is a worthy man, but little Mrs Deakin passing, that I do call my
Morena, I would not be seen talking to one so scurvily clad, and so
incontinently left him standing and hasted away."</p>
<p>So it passed, nor did I ask him if he hasted after his Morena,
for heaven be thankt that she did pass by, though I thought not to
live to say it. But I will take order with olde Mr Crosby, for olde
men be tattlers more than any woman or is convenient. And so a
great escape.</p>
<p>So Sam'l carries me to the Paynter where he sits for his face
and very like it is, yet do not please, he thinking it do make his
Eyes too small and ill-favoured, but I not so, and Lord! to see him
sit Smirking upon Mr Savile since Mrs Knipp hath commended his
Smyle! But Mr Savile the Paynter seeing me did speak in very
handsome language, telling Sam'l he hath a Beauty to his wife
worthy that her picture should be with the Court Ladies' pictures,
and much more fine things, harping on the same string, whereto
Sam'l made answer that he would consider of it. But to see the
Vanity of men, when all the world knows that the sight of a pretty
Woman's face is worth all the men that ever were or will be! So I
sat devising how to set myself off if this should be, and did like
well of my Cardinal sattin suit with a chapeau de poil tied beneath
my chin. Or it may be, perles in my hayre, and to borrow my Lady's
if so she will. Fritters for supper, the best I ever did eat, Sam'l
confirming me in this, and he discoursing very high of the
corruption of the times, and no regard to clean living in court or
city, and glad I am that thus he thinks, and do hope he acts
answerably, as he should.</p>
<p>27th.&mdash;This day, by long promise, Sam'l do carry me to
White Hall to see the Queen in her presence Chamber playing at
Cards with her ladies, and the people looking and crowding upon
them. He commending Mrs Stewart for a great Beauty and so indeede
she is, and one I do not weary in looking on, and do far outshine
my Lady Castlemaine as I well perceive His Maj'tie do also thinke.
Her Maj'tie appearing very comely in a Gown of silver lace, but
Lord! how no one takes heed of her when my Lady Castlemaine is by,
which is a great dishonour to a sweete Lady in her owne Court, and
I am much mistook if Her Maj'tie be not the best Lady of them all,
and that not saying much! But strange to see how beauty sways all
and how Sam'l do uphold my Lady Castlemaine in all things.</p>
<p>Captain Holmes accosted us and very fine in his gold laced suit,
and it is noticeable that Sam'l troubled in mind because he well
knows that Captain H&mdash;&mdash; hath called me for a Toast and
the greatest Beauty in Town. And this Sam'l likes well of for his
own Pride, yet not for me to know. So saying we must return in
Haste, he would bid adieu to the Captain, but he followed and
escorted me very gallant to the Coche, hat under his arm, and so
kissed my hand at parting not once but twice. Now I know well to
make Captain Holmes or any other Captain keepe his Distance, but
Sam'l, thinking all one as himself, in a sadd musty humour, and yet
would not come forth with what ailed him. So I do Debate with
myself if it be not well he should see that Men of court and
Fashion do judge me worth a thought. And I think it be, and so I do
learn my Part.</p>
<p>In comes Mrs. Knipp to play and sing. Very witty and pleasant
doubtlesse, and they very merry. I with Jane, contriving my olde
pettycote with a broade blacke lace at the foot to hide the wear.
But indeede I begin to be full of thoughts considering if I do well
in going to Brampton, when Sam'l alone in Towne do friske and
please himself as he will, Jane confirming me in this. He home with
Knipp, returning in a great Tosse because I did not bid her to sup
with us, and do pull his supper all about the floor, a good hasht
hen as ever a man did eat, when he should the rather soberly thank
heaven for meat and appettite. But sorry later, there being nought
else but sops and wine. And so, good friends and to bed, the Storms
coming and going, but I think he do love me at heart, and indeede I
do love him well.</p>
<p>28th.&mdash;Lord's Day. To church at St. Olave's where a poor
dull sermon from a bawling Scotman, and Sam'l to sleep, a thing
unseemly in the Church, but I awake and did fix in my mind the
pattern of my Lady Batten's Hood, the which I would not ask of her
for that we do of late a little make ourselves strange to her and
her family, but the less matter because I now have it in my Eye.
Mrs Lethulier masqued, which methought a strange thing to be seen
at Worshipp, though the great Ladies do now carry their masques to
the Play that none may see them Blush, or rather, as Sam'l do say,
that none may see they cannot blush if they would. And indeed all
the Men do now complain that the Beauties hide their faces.
<i>Mem</i>. To Buy a masque in Paternoster Row when I do go to Mr
Crosby. This night to bed in the little green chamber&mdash;the
Chymney swepers in our own.</p>
<p>1st <i>June</i>.&mdash;To my Lady this day and do give her my
thankfull gratitude for that she hath spoke with Sam'l concerning
my poore clothes, telling her of the Lace he did give, she pishing
and pshawing it for a meane gift, remembering the money that do
pass through his hands whereof my Lord hath informed her. Comes
Sam'l later to carry me home, and my Lady speaking with him of my
Lady Jem's marriage with young Mr Carteret do say he is so abasht
and so little coming forward with his courtship that it do much
discomfort poor Lady Jem as not knowing what he would be at. So my
Lady beseecht Sam'l that he would instruct him how to court a lady,
he otherwise doing very well, and a worthy Gentleman, and one my
Lady Jem could like of if not so shamefaced. Sam'l simpring upon
this, as who should say, "None better," do make us merry, seeing
him already conning over what manner of Speeches and approaches
will grace the Gentleman, but I do know him well able in such
matters. And indeed in all.</p>
<p>2d <i>July</i>.&mdash;Lesson, and do now begin well to read.
Bought masque of the Toy woman, in the Row, she saying, "Lord! is
this the fayre Mrs Pepys, wife to Mr Sam'l Pepys, that is known for
a great man to be? Sure Madam was well pleased with the French
mantle that he did buy for her a sennight come Saturday?"</p>
<p>So seeing she was a little ugly talking woman, I did sound her
on this, for it vexed me cruelly since he hath sent it to another.
And for all, I do and will believe it is but sporting and jesting,
which if I did not, God help us all! So sadly and soberly home, but
yet said nothing. Pray God all be well.</p>
<p>24th <i>July</i>.&mdash;For many days have I not writ, for at
the last I did come to read what I would, and though not all, for
some is in Greeke or I know not what, yet what I did read hath
broke my heart. His Mrs Lane that he did prayse for a God-fearing
woman, his Deb&mdash;but what do I say?&mdash;sure he hath not a
heart but a stone. So I telling him certayne things of my knowledge
(and yet not how I did know them), he in great fear and terrour and
as I thought unlike a man of Courage. Which did shame me for him
that I could scarce bring myself to look in his face and see him
thus, remembering his high carriage that I did use to see in him.
And times there were when I would the rather he did Brazen it out,
it seeming so poor a thing to see him so low, and times again when
in Madness I would have taken a knife to him, but he did pull it
away with weeping Teares and promise of amendment. But how to trust
him or any I cannot tell. And I have bid Will Hewer (Sam'l humbly
agreeing thereto) that he continue with his master and oversee him
in all his walks abroad, doing me to wit where he goeth. Yet, how
to trust Will&mdash;for sure all men are alike and will give the
other countenance in Deceit. So what way to surety, for if a man
regard not his wife where shall she look for good? And truly I do
believe that in such Trafficking men do chip and whittle away their
heart till none be left and they cannot love if they would, and no
anchorage in so rotten a Holding ground. And thus have I learned
that a woman may be young and yet aweary of her life, which I did
not think to be true.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would I had not read, and again I would know more
and run the knife yet deeper in my heart, and in that curst book
never will I read again, and even in the writing of this well do I
know I cannot forbear to read, and so Teares my drink and all my
content gone. But let me remember there was here and there a word
where he hath writ tenderly of his poor Wife, and when I did see
him weep my heart did pity him. But what hope or help, for a Jar
mended may hold water, but yet the Cracks remain, and the worth
gone for ever and a Day.</p>
<p>Well, God mend all, and yet I think He cannot. But in this Booke
of mine will I never write more, for the mirth and the little Frets
that I did think so great alike do pierce my heart to read. So
farewell, my Booke, that was a good friend in sunshine but an ill
friend in storm, for I am done with thee and with many things more
this day.</p>
<p>And so to the work that must be done and the day that must be
lived though Brows ake and heart break.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>II. THE MYSTERY OF STELLA</h2>
<h3>Esther Johnson<br>
"Stella"<br>
1681-1728</h3>
<p>Jonathan Swift's cousin and biographer sums up his views of the
mystery of Stella in definite fashion: "For that she was married to
Dr Swift about the year 1716, I am thoroughly persuaded, although
it is certain they continued to live in separate Houses in the same
manner they had usually done before." Other contemporaries of Swift
are equally persuaded that no marriage took place at all. Under the
circumstances, it is no great marvel if, as one gossip suggests,
"her spirits might have become dejected, by her frequent revolving
in her mind the Odness of her Situation."</p>
<p>When Esther Johnson's mother was companion to Lady Giffard,
sister of Sir William Temple, the "Platonick" friendship between
the young girl and Temple's secretary began. There are reports of
Stella's charm, not only in the Journal, but in a general tradition
that she was "surrounded by every Grace and blessed with every
Virtue that could allure the Affections and captivate the Soul of
the most stubborn Philosopher." Says John Hawkesworth: "There was a
natural musick in her Voice, and a pleasing complacency in her
aspect when she spoke. As to her wit, it was confessed by all her
acquaintance and particularly by the Dean, that she never failed to
say the best thing that was said whenever she was in company."</p>
<p>She died at forty-seven, and was buried in St. Patrick's
Cathedral, where Swift, seventeen years later, by his own
instructions, was buried at her side.</p>

<b><i>Esther Johnson<br>
"Stella"</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p><i>This paper have I wrote for certain grave considerations
which make me suppose it well it were one day placed in the hands
of the Dean. 'Tis, however, possible I may destroy it, but this
time shall determine ere my death. Writ an: 1727 by me</i>, ESTHER
JOHNSON.</p>
<p>When the Dean paid his last visit to London, an: 1726, he writ
thus in a letter directed to Mrs Dingley, but for her and
me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Farewell, my dearest lives and delights I love you better than
ever, as hope saved, and ever will. I can count on nothing but MD's
love and kindness, and so, farewell, dearest MD. PRESTO."</p>
<p>So he signs himself, and so it seems the old screen will still
be kept up and the letters to me wrote to her also, and in the
child's talk that pleaseth him, lest any in the world suspect the
famous divine hath a man's heart. But hath he? This I have not
known, nor shall. Let me tell my own heart yet again how deep my
debt to him, remembering the sickly child of Moor Park, to whom he
brought not alone learning but companionship, and all the joy known
to her childhood. For it pleased Dr Swift, then a young man, to
condescend to a child's humours, to solace her solitary hours,
forsook as she was of her mother's company, and not alone to teach
her to write, but all store of knowledge. And Dr Swift hath since
been pleased to acknowledge that, having instilled in this poor
child the principles of honour and virtue, she hath not swerved
from them in any passage of her life.</p>
<p>Yet have I not? Again I question my heart. 'T is the most I can
hope that the woman hath repaid the child's debt. On this I will be
judged.</p>
<p>A keen remembrance begins not much before the age of eight, nor
can I recall a time when I did not love him. My mother's time was
took up in making her court to my Lady Giffard, sister to our
benefactor, Sir William Temple; and Rebecca Dingley's (a kinswoman
of the Temples) in making her court to all; and the child Esther
might run as she pleased, chid only when she was remembered.</p>
<p>And this young man took pity on her. I remember very well Dr
Swift's face in youth. 'Twas extraordinary handsome and commanding,
the eyes blue and piercing, the features strong, and a something
that very early distinguisht him from others, so that great persons
coming of errands to Sir William Temple were not seldom drawn into
intercourse with his secretary.</p>
<p>Mr Swift was not then so prudent as he became later. What need
with a child? He permitted his fancy to range in all he said; and
seated by the lake at Moor Park, with this child at his knee
looking up into his face, he would discourse of things in heaven
and earth, forgetting his hearer. For he who could charm all
charmed himself no less, and often hath said to me
laughing:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There's no company so good as Jonathan Swift's&mdash;and he
himself would choose it before all others!"</p>
<p>Of this I am not certain, for the Dean hath been and is very
partial to the company of the great and famous of either sex.</p>
<p>'Twas thus, sitting by the lake and gazing down the great
perspective cut in the trees, he saw the peasants going homeward up
the hill, no greater than ants, and looking into my eyes (from
which and my name he called me Star, and later, Stella), he
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What say you, Mrs Star, if these folk were really no bigger
than now they seem? What if this country were peopled by a race of
little creeping Hop-o'-my-Thumbs?"</p>
<p>"O rare, rare!" I cried, and clapt my hands. "Tell me the
history of them, Mr Swift, and their little homely ways and houses
like bees' cells for size."</p>
<p>And as I looked up and the words came from him, truly all was
visible before me. 'Tis a gift Mr Swift hath had from the
beginning, that men should see what he would. And women,&mdash;O
Father Almighty,&mdash;women!</p>
<p>So that was the beginning of Gulliver his travels, that being
told for a child's pleasure hath since become a world's wonder. It
had not then the meanings he gave it later, nor were there any
Yahoos.</p>
<p>If I ask myself when this harmless love did change to a woman's,
I cannot tell, because with my growth it grew. But the first pain
it brought (and sure pain is love's shadow) was an: 1697, when I
was sixteen years of age. For I sat by the housekeeper's window,
and Sir William and Mr Swift were pacing the path, their voices
coming and going. Mr Swift was now dressed as the young Levite he
sometimes called himself since he returned from Ireland a
clergyman; and he walked with his eyes fixed moodily on the ground,
listening to Sir William.</p>
<p>"Why, as to that, Jonathan," said he familiarly, "I ever thought
it behoves a parson to marry when he hath got preferment. There is
room for Mrs Parson's help with the women and children of the
parish and 't is meet she should set an example with her neat
parsonage, and be a notable woman with her possets and cordials for
the sick. Now what like is this pretty Varina that Dr Holmes hath
brought news of from Belfast?"</p>
<p>"Miss Waring," says Mr Swift, very grave, "is a commendable
young lady, but I design not for marriage as yet, Sir, nor for a
long time to come."</p>
<p>They past out of hearing and, returning, I heard but the last
part of Sir William's words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'T is a cruel thing for a man to raise hopes he means not to be
answerable for, and I am told the young lady grows very melancholy
upon it. True it is, a man must sow his wild oats even though he
honour his cloth; but 't is not well to sow them in a harmless
girl's acre, Jonathan. Sow them by the wayside, and then they come
not up to her confusion and your own."</p>
<p>"A sound precept, Sir; but better still to sow none. This shall
be my care. As to the connection you speak of, 't is long broke
off, and was at all times impossible, the lady having no portion,
and myself&mdash;as you know!"</p>
<p>His brow was like a thunder-cloud ere it bursts; but, looking
up, he catcht sight of me, and continued with no pause:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As for that matter of the publishers, Sir&mdash;they have writ
to say that they wait your commands anent the Letters of Phalaris.
Asking your pardon, time goes, and we should be speaking of this
and not of child's toys."</p>
<p>I knew by the black blink of his eyes that I had heard what he
would not; and as they turned, my heart beat so that I laid my hand
on it, as if that poor fence might hide its throbbing. And for the
first time in my life I knew I had in this world an enemy, and that
was this Varina; and from that hour mine eyes waited on him.</p>
<p>More often mine eyes than my company, for, especially since this
conversation with Sir William, Mr Swift was now grown very
cautious. In public he addressed me as "Mrs Johnson," or, when Sir
William rallied him, as "Mrs Esther," affecting an awful distance,
which was not in his heart, for therein was still the tenderness
for his child and pupil, as he had used to call me. And he was good
enough to signify to Mrs Dingley, who carried it to me, that he
found me grown to his liking; "beautiful, graceful, and agreeable,"
says he, and condescended to praise even my black hair and pale
face, after which I would not have exchanged it against the golden
hair of Helen. But still held aloof except when I was in company
with others. And I took note that, of all the ladies that came and
went at Moor Park, there was not one but hung upon his talk, and
held up her head when he came near, spreading out all her graces.
Mr Swift had always that power with our sex and, if he used it, 't
is but what all men do. Providence made us fair game, to our
undoing and theirs. 'T is not all men who have this gift, and never
have I seen one who, having it, spared to use it, whether from
liking or policy.</p>
<p>Yet he used it strangely. I remember, when the fair Lady Mary
Fane came to Moor Park,&mdash;a widowed beauty and toast,&mdash;the
look of scorn she cast from her fine eyes on the young
secretary.</p>
<p>"I marvel, Sir William," says she, "that you will have your
servant ever at your elbow, so that a body hath never a word with
you alone. I would not presume to censure, but certainly my
father's chaplain does not so intrude himself into company; and
'tis difficult for persons of quality to speak their mind in such
underbred society."</p>
<p>"Why, your Ladyship," says he, laughing, "be gracious to my
young Levite. He is not of the common sort of creeping parson, but
I dare venture will yet be heard of. Simple as your Ladyship thinks
him, he is at home in all company, be it great or little; and I had
not known him three year when I sent him to London on a secret
errand&mdash;and I was not mistook."</p>
<p>"Such persons," says the lady, very haughty, "are paid to exert
themselves in our service. We may expect no less."</p>
<p>So it passed; but a busybody carried this, with other tattle, to
Mr Swift, who questioned me also. I looked to see him mighty angry;
and first his brows frowned, and then he laughed, as if a thought
pleased him.</p>
<p>"Said she so, the painted jade! What, Madam Stella, shall not a
stinking pride be taught its place by the Church? I'll give the
hussy her lesson."</p>
<p>That very day, my Lady Mary sitting to embroidery on the great
terrace in the shade, and I holding her threads, she threw Mr Swift
a word as he past, to ask the name of the nymph that was turned to
a bush to escape the pursuit of Apollo; for that was the subject of
her needle.</p>
<p>"Daphne, Madam," says he. "Have I your permission to look upon
your work? Oh, fie!&mdash;this bush&mdash;'t is a rosebush, and
Daphne became a laurel. Sure, a lady with your Ladyship's
reputation for wit will not be in error."</p>
<p>She stopped with the needle in her hand and lookt at him
angrily.</p>
<p>"Sir, if you know better than Mrs Weyland who drew my pattern,
instruct me. I am not too proud to learn from
my&mdash;betters."</p>
<p>She made the word an insult, and went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have I done amiss to give Apollo wings to his feet?"</p>
<p>"Why, indeed, Madam,'tis Mercury carries the wings. In another
lady's presence I had said 'tis Cupid, but from some ladies love
cannot fly."</p>
<p>So it began. In a moment more she had bid him be seated, and
tell her stories that a lady might paint with her needle. And
presently her hands dropt in her lap, and her eyes fixed on his
face, and 't was not long ere I was dismist.</p>
<p>That evening he came into Dingley's room, where I sat with her
to repair the household linen, and rattled on, full of wit and good
humour; and when Dingley went out to fetch a cordial for him, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, Mistress Stella, did we give the lying slut her lesson
today&mdash;did we? Sure,'twas a pure bite!"</p>
<p>And says I:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have seldom heard your Reverence more entertaining."</p>
<p>And he, laughing hugely:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A cat may be choked with cream as well as fishbones, Mrs
Stella. Keep your pretty little eyes open, child, and thou shalt
see."</p>
<p>In a week she was his humble servant. 'T is scarce credible, but
I saw her once lay her hand, sparkling with jewels, upon his, and
he shake it off as if 't were dirt. I saw the water brim her eyes
as she lookt at him and he laught and turned away. Indeed, her
Ladyship had her lesson ere she left Moor Park, and I knew not then
enough to pity her. Pity&mdash;'t is a flower that grows in the
furrows of a heart ploughed over by sorrow, and my day was not yet
come. He laught with me over the disconsolate beauty, when she
importuned him to be her son's tutor, and he replied he had far
other views.</p>
<p>Yet for all his caution we met sometimes, when I be gathering
flowers and lavender, or fruit for Mrs Groson the cook. And I knew
he loved to talk with me. He loves it still. Many was the jest we
had&mdash;jests with their root in childhood and folly to all but
him and me.</p>
<p>So came the day that changed all.</p>
<p>'Twas a fair sunset, with one star shining, and I stood in the
copse far from the house, to hear the nightingale; and, though I
thought of him, did not see that he leaned against the King's
Beech, until he stirred and made my heart to flutter.</p>
<p>"I watch your namesake, Stella," says he, "and wonder if in that
sweet star are plots and envyings&mdash;a Marlborough intriguing
against his King, a Burnet plotting for an archbishopric, an ugly
Dutch monsterkin on the throne&mdash;and a naughty rogue called
Stella, that hath forgot her old tutor and loves him no more. Yet
if that love should miscarry, I know not&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If it miscarry," says I, trembling, "there will be many to
succeed it.</p>
<p>But I think, Mr Swift, it cannot."</p>
<p>"Many?" he answered, and up went his brows. "Such as my Lady
Mary and such-like? But that is no love, Stellakin. 'T is only thy
innocence could mistake it. The true name is none so pretty, and
not for thy lips. Get thee to a nunnery, child&mdash;the world is
not for such as thee."</p>
<p>So I faltered out: "What is love?"</p>
<p>"A thing that hath no existence between man and woman in this
world, so mixed is it with lust and hatred and jealousy. True,
there is love, but it is not that one. 'T is the loves filial and
paternal, and friendship, better than all the loves the rhymesters
hang with their namby-pamby. The love between the sexes&mdash;'t is
a game wherein the weaker loses, and then&mdash; <i>voe victis!</i>
Hast forgot thy Latin, child?"</p>
<p>And then I broke out into a great sobbing, as if my bursting
heart would break; for, I know not why, but this cut me like a
knife. And he took my hand with anxious kindness to soothe me; and
at the bird's rustle in the tree, dropt it and stood apart. He
lived in the eye of the world even in such affections as he owned.
But I sobbed on.</p>
<p>"Pray, pray, don't sob, Stella," he says. "This is mighty,
mighty ill and like a child. Dry those pretty eyes,&mdash;prettier,
gadso! than any Lady Mary's of them all!&mdash;and tell me wherein
I have offended 'T was not willingly."</p>
<p>So, drowned in tears, I lookt up, and having lookt, turned away
weeping, and could say no more. For what skill had I to argufy with
a man of such infinite parts? And yet well I knew that in this
matter of love I was the wiser, though but a simpleton. But he
caught my hands.</p>
<p>"Have I hurt thee, Stella? I were a devil if I did. What ails my
girl at love? What is it to thee? Keep away from that raging fire.
Souse it with every stream of reason and honour. Heap the ice of
the Pole on it, for it is not only hell itself but feeds the flame
of hell eternal."</p>
<p>He so wrung my hand that it pained; and I saw his face work like
a man most desperately sick and ill. It dried the tears in my eyes,
and I stood trembling and staring upon him, and the twilight was
sweet about us with a smell of grass and growing things and
flowers; a night for lovers&mdash;and I most miserable.</p>
<p>"I doubt&mdash;" he began and stopt; and then, with a cry that
choked in his throat, he put his arms about me and I laid my head
on his breast.</p>
<p>Should I blame myself for that half-hour? Should I blame my
Dear, the Desire of mine eyes? 'T was but a step to take across the
line that parts innocence from&mdash;No, no, never will I say
guilt! 'T was not guilt, if all the tongues of men and angels
should so preach. 'T is in the later denial of love that guilt lay
hid. But these things I did not then know, and I thought in my
simplicity the world changed and the foolish girl become a woman
and beloved, and our lives together in a fair prospect before
us.</p>
<p>And suddenly&mdash;"Go&mdash;go!" he cried, rejecting me and
thrusting me from him.</p>
<p>"Go, and never again let me see your face. I sicken&mdash;I
sicken at what is done. No&mdash;no! Speak not, utter not, lest I
strike you and myself dead.</p>
<p>Leave me, for God's pity's sake! Go!"</p>
<p>So did the Angel with the flaming sword drive our first parents
out of Paradise. I drew apart shuddering, and he cried after me in
a loud whisper:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let none see your face. Go in by the covered door, and so to
your room, and plead headache if Dingley see you. Go."</p>
<p>I left him in the dark. I drew my palatine about my face and
none saw; and so to my room, and outed the light, and sat by the
window till the dawn came.</p>
<p>Now, if I am condemned herein, I take the blame, but cannot
change my thought. What woman in giving all met ever so sorry a
return&mdash;and why? I broke my brain with thinking, and at that
time found no answer. Later, I knew. But to escape the hue and cry
of question, I washed the tears from my eyes in the morning, and so
to the housekeeper's room. And he was there, reading in a great
book, and my heart leapt like the last leap of a hare with the dogs
on it.</p>
<p>"Why, Stellakin&mdash;saucy-nose!" says he, laughing, but his
face was pale. He could cheat with his words, but I saw his face
bleacht like a linen clout behind his laugh, and I swear at that
time he loved me, though he loved advancement better. "You are
bright and early, young woman! Are you for the garden, to get you a
stomach for breakfast? Well, so-so! and pray for poor Presto as you
go; for in honour and conscience, his Ppt is the child of his
heart."</p>
<p>How could I endure this? I closed the door, and left him
laughing with white lips.</p>
<p>So went the day, and now I saw his drift. He would hold the
little language of childhood for a shield betwixt us. I should be
nothing more for ever than Ppt,&mdash;poor pretty
thing,&mdash;Stellakin, the pretty rogue. He would not fail in
this, but only in all my hopes. He would give me all but that I
longed for. He would glut me with sugar-comfits but never a taste
of the living bread.</p>
<p>And next day a new thing. Dingley and I sitting together, he
came upon us, and in all he said included ker. She was his second
MD. He was her poor Presto, also. I saw his will and knew he built
a fence about himself.</p>
<p>Sometimes I thought I had but a mean spirit so to live, and
thought to ask his meaning; but dared not, for he struck an awe
into my very soul. So gradually the days covered that sunset, and't
was impossible I should speak; and life went by, and still I
studied with him, but Dingley always present.</p>
<p>Hath he a heart? I know not. That sunset was a grave between us;
and had the corpse risen and stared him in the face, I think he had
run mad. In my solitary hours, I would imagine I spoke. Sometimes I
would kneel before him entreating, and he would raise me up, as a
certain king did another Esther. Sometimes he would fall at my
knees, and I would bow my head upon him, weeping for joy.</p>
<p>But yet always I knew that, if we glanced near that secret, he
would rise and stare upon me with a ghastly face, and I would see
him no more. Yet at that time he loved me. To himself he will not
lie in reading this.</p>
<p>'Twas in 1699 Sir William Temple died, and the household at Moor
Park was broke up. Mr Swift took the kindest part in my settlement
and the laying out of my little fortune. "And be easy about money,
you nauti-nauti, dear girls," says he to old Dingley and me; "for
what is mine is yours; and were it my blood, 't is all one."</p>
<p>And so laid his plans that we should come to Ireland, where he
had preferment at Laracor near Dublin, and the prebend of Dunlavin
in St. Patrick's Cathedral. And, God forgive me, I asked myself if
the thought to keep me under his guidance mingled not itself with
all his kindness.</p>
<p>So I, being twenty years old, and Dingley a kind bustling woman,
we went; and Ireland was a kindly home, for 't was near him, and I
might see him. Not as I would&mdash;oh, never that! but as a
friend, provided 't was with caution. For as he now mounted in the
Church, and his ambition strengthened on him (and sure Wolsey
himself did not more suffer from that failing of noble minds),
caution grew to be his main thought; for he said the adventure of
our coming looked so like a frolic that censure might hold as if
there were a secret history in such a removal; but this would soon
blow over by circumspect conduct, and this too was used to put a
distance between us. But 't was the condition of our intercourse,
and thus I accepted it. For aught I could discern, all else was
clean forgot, and we lodged near him and met as friends&mdash;no
more.</p>
<p>Nor could I think otherwise when Mr Tisdall, his friend, made
suit to me. I was cold,&mdash;what else,&mdash;for I thought myself
a wife, if a forsaken one, and Mr Tisdall imagined that Dr Swift
opposed his suit, objecting that his means did not come up to the
expectation he formed for me, who was, he said, in a manner, his
ward.</p>
<p>Poor Mr Tisdall writ in haste on this, and brought me Dr Swift's
reply (who had not broke the matter to me) and thus it
ran:&mdash;</p>
<p>My conjecture is that you think I obstruct your inclinations to
please my own. In answer to all which I will, upon my conscience
and honour, tell you the naked truth, [The naked truth! O God, if
it were told!] If my fortunes and humour served me to think of that
state, I should certainly make your choice, because I never saw
that person whose conversation I entirely valued but hers. This was
the utmost I ever gave way to. [But once&mdash;but once!] And this
regard of mine never once entered my head as an impediment to you,
since it is held so necessary and convenient a thing for ladies to
marry, and that time takes off the lustre of virgins in all other
eyes but mine.</p>
<p>This Mr Tisdall offered on his knees, declaring it must remove
my last objections, since the worthy friend of my childhood
supported his suit. I received it sedately, and dismist him with
the compunction so worthy a gentleman merited. Was this letter
honest to his friend? I say not.</p>
<p>Henceforth he disliked Mr Tisdall. Could I impute this to
jealousy? Why not? A man will be jealous if his dog but lick the
hand of another; and, though he reserve himself perfect freedom, no
man must so much as sigh for the woman he hath once honoured with
his regard. Truly there is a something Oriental in the passions of
men; and if a woman break through this, 'tis at her peril.</p>
<p>So stood matters when the Doctor went to London, an: 1710, on
his errand of obtaining the First Fruits for the Irish Church from
the Crown&mdash;and he chosen all others to this, for his
commanding talent and presence, though then but forty-two years of
age, and many dignitaries older, yet not wiser. It created much
envy.</p>
<p>I missed him, and yet took a sad ease in his going. 'Twas the
easier to talk with Dingley, to play at ombre with the Dean and Mrs
Walls; for when he was in presence, my heart waited upon his
speech, and he wounded with many a word and look he thought not on.
And he writ often in the form of a Journal to Dingley and me,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I will write something every day to MD, and when it is full,
will send it; and that will be pretty, and I will always be in
conversation with MD, and MD with Presto."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>'T was near a year since his going when Mrs Coleburn came to
Dublin, full of London talk, and her friendship with the great Dr
Swift, the hope of the Tories. Indeed, it made her a great woman
with the clergy in Dublin, that she knew so much of his sayings and
doings, and in what high company he was got, and the clutter he
made in London. Much was true, as I knew under his own hand. Much
was idle twattle and the giddiness of a woman that will be talking.
Now, one day, she visited me, dressed out in the last London mode,
and talked as I knotted, and presently says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And, Mrs Johnson, what will be said, the Doctor being made a
Bishop as he now looks for, if he bring home a fine young bride
from London? Sure he lives at Mrs Vanhomrigh's, so often is he
there; and Hessy is as pretty a girl as eye can see, in her young
twenties and a bit of a fortune to boot. I have ever said the
Doctor was not on the market for nothing. He is not the man for a
portionless beauty. Hath he wrote of this? for all the tongues are
wagging, and the lady in such a blaze with the tender passion that
she can't by any means smother it."</p>
<p>"Doctor Swift hath often writ of Mrs Vanhomrigh and her
hospitalities," says I, smiling. "Also of the charming Miss V. Her
name is no stranger here."</p>
<p>So I baffled the woman, and could see her petty malice dumbed. I
held the smile on my face like a mask.</p>
<p>"Well, 'tis a charming creature, and the Doctor commends her wit
in all quarters; and 't is certain lie should be a judge, for he
tutors her in Latin. There's many a man would gladly tutor the
seductive Miss Hessy."</p>
<p>When she took leave, I writ to the kind Patty Holt in London.
When her reply returned, 't was but to confirm Mrs Coleburn. Then I
turned over all his letters&mdash;yet did not need&mdash;for
mention of this woman, and found but three, though of the mother
and her house he writ in almost every letter, but making somewhat
too light of it. 'Twas a raging pain that he should be her
tutor&mdash;I had thought that was mine only and not to
recur&mdash;a memory stored where neither rust nor moth might touch
it. Well&mdash;what could I but hate the girl? And to hate is a
bitter thing: it saps the life and breaks the strength, and so no
escape night or day. I must then fancy his letters cooling, and
later says Dingley unprompted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Doctor is took up with his fine friends and his business.
La!&mdash;for sure he writes not as he did, but is plaguey busy.
Two simple women can't expect so much of his time that duchesses go
begging for."</p>
<p>He stayed long away, and Patty Holt writ often, discreet and
willing to serve me; and one day comes a packet from her, and when
I cut the seals, out falls a letter&mdash;his. I read it first.</p>
<blockquote>Miss Hessy, I am so weary of this place ['t was
Windsor] that I am resolved to leave it in two days. I will come as
early on Monday as I can find opportunity, and will take a little
Grub Street lodgings pretty near where I did before, and will dine
with you three times a week and tell you a thousand secrets,
provided you will have no quarrels with me. I long to drink a dish
of coffee in the sluttery, and hear you dun me for secrets, and
"Drink your coffee&mdash;why don't you drink your
coffee?"</blockquote>
<p>So he writ, and more&mdash;much more could I read unsaid. For
him, this was much&mdash;I knew it. Then, another letter&mdash;a
woman's hand.</p>
<blockquote>It is inexpressible the concern I am in ever since I
heard from Mrs Lewis that your head is so much out of order. Who is
your physician? Satisfy me so much as to tell me what medicines you
have took and do take. O what would I give to know how you do this
instant. My fortune is too hard. Your absence was enough without
this cruel addition. I have done all that was possible to hinder
myself from writing for fear of breaking my promise; but it is all
in vain; for had I vowed neither to touch pen, ink, or paper, I
certainly should have had some other invention, and I am impatient
to the last degree to hear how you are. I hope I shall soon have
you here.</blockquote>
<p>The two were wrapt in a sheet from Patty who had writ
thereon:&mdash;"Dropt by the Doctor when in a giddy attack,
visiting me."</p>
<p>I think she was shamed. So was not I. As well ask the hound if
he is shamed when tracking the deer. Had it been to save my life,
instead of lose it, I had less eagerly read. 'T was clear they
understood one another. With me, in his caution, Dingley must be
joined when he writ. With her, not so. Her happiness was a knife
turned in a bleeding wound.</p>
<p>So I writ him, in a letter of many matters, somewhat scornfully
of the family as marvelling a little that he whom all solicited
could be satisfied with such inconsiderable people. In time he
replied thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir A. Fountaine and I dined by invitation with Mrs V.
You say they are of no consequence&mdash;why, they keep as good
female company as I do male. I see all the drabs of quality at this
end of the town with them. I saw two Lady Bettys there this
afternoon. Rare walking in the Park now. Why don't you walk in the
Green of St. Stephen's? What beasts the Irish women are, never to
walk.</blockquote>
<p>Men hide not matters so well as women. They say too much or not
enough.</p>
<p>Much later he writ: "I found Mrs V. all in combustion with her
landlord. Her eldest daughter is of age, and going to Ireland to
look after her fortune and get it in her own hands."</p>
<p>So I was to think it concerned them not to be apart. Immediately
I set my wits to discover where was her estate, and 't was not long
ere I knew 't was Marlay Abbey, near Celbridge; but the lady would
reside in Dublin while making her dispositions, being Mrs Emerson's
guest, and was like to be at a rout at her house. 'Twas long since
I attended a rout, but I intrigued to be bidden as courtiers
intrigue for an inch of blue ribbon; and in such a fever and
anguish as I think I had died of it if not successful.</p>
<p>So, when the day was come, I went with Mrs Stoyte; and the first
person I saw was a young lady on the stair-head as we went up, and
Mrs Emerson presenting her to many. A fine young London madam, who
curtseyed to me, taking no more heed than of any other.</p>
<p>Shall I admit her beauty? I did not think her charming, despite
fine sparkling eyes and a luxuriance of brown hair. Her lips were
full and her chin round, but she looked full her age, and between
the brows was a line that I would call the Doctor's sign-manual. I
have it myself&mdash;I have seen it in others&mdash;'t is the
claw-foot of care, care never-ending and cruel unrest, and hope
that sickens the spirit and fades the bloom; and in her, though but
just of age, the first bloom was gone that is like morning dew in a
young girl's eyes. He loves to tyrannise over women and show his
familiarity by a certain brutality of address, and the line comes
not slowly.</p>
<p>I caught sight of her person with mine in a long glass&mdash;she
in her sea-green sacque flowered with pink, and myself in
gray,&mdash;"an angel's face a little cracked,"&mdash;that was the
best he could say for Stella! She gave not a thought to the faded
Dublin lady that would have given all but her eternal hope to read
in that girl's soul. Oh, the mask of the human face behind which
none may look!</p>

<br>
<b><i>Hester Vanhomrigh<br>
Vanessa</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p>So she went, and after a year he returned, now Dean of St.
Patrick. He was kind, but 't was a kindness that stood apart and
viewed itself carefully, lest it diminish my due. 'Twas easy seen
he was engaged in thought. Well&mdash; shall a woman expect more
from a man in the world's eye? Let her be humbly grateful for the
crumbs he lets fall.</p>
<p>Also for the crumbs from her rival's table; for Miss Hessy
following, and now an orphan, was established soon after at Marlay;
and whether I would or not, I knew when the Dean's rides took him
that way, my Mrs Prue being courted by his man Samuel, and all he
did trickling through that channel. 'T was at this time also that
copies were handed about of his poem, "Cadenus and Vanessa," and 't
was the very top of talk and admiration. Many might guess who was
the lady, and the Dean was mighty angry, and said 'twas but a jest,
and no friend to him who took it otherwise.</p>
<p>He asked me with a feigned carelessness if I had read it; and I
replying carelessly that I thought it extreme fine and could wish
he would write oftener in that vein, he smiled and looked pleased,
and so it passed. But again and yet again I conned the
lines:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
'T is to the world a secret yet
  Whether the nymph, to please her swain,
  Talks in a high romantic strain,
Or whether he at last descends
 To act with less seraphic ends.
  Or, to compound the business, whether
  They temper love and books together,
Must never to mankind be told,
Nor shall the conscious Muse unfold.
</pre>
<p>I knew the meaning of that passage where others guesst. I read
it by the light of a sunset many years gone, and lived in hell.</p>
<p>'T was when Mr Dean was next in London, came a letter to me</p>
<blockquote>Madam, I have great and urgent reason to wish the
honour of meeting you and a half hour's conversation. Any place you
may condescend to appoint will be perfectly agreeable and the
favour prized by<br>
<br>
Your obedient humble servant,<br>
<br>
ESTHER VANHOMRIGH</blockquote>
<p>(who would not ask it unless it concerned Mrs Johnson as nearly
as herself).</p>
<p>I broke my brains thinking, should I or should I not? Nor can I
now unravel all the motives at work. But in two days' time I
writ:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Madam, I have a difficulty to come at the reason for
your request, but am compelled by courtesy to appoint three o' the
clock at the rooms of Mrs Dew, my old servant, at Kidder Street,
No. 12. Your obt humble servant,<br>
<br>
ESTHER JOHNSON.</blockquote>
<p>Strange our names should be alike!</p>
<p>She was the first at the meeting. I ensured this, delaying my
chair at the corner of Kidder Street till I saw her enter.</p>
<p>The room was small and poorly decent, and her hoop and mine
filled it. She curtseyed low, as did I, and though she aimed at
composure, I could see her lips work. The line between her brows
was eight years deeper, her face pale, the bloom faded, and her
mouth droopt. Had she been any other, I had pitied her. His
friendship is fatal to my sex, though I have wore it like an
honour. For me, I was composed. It's not for nothing I have spent
my life in that school&mdash;she was a newer pupil.</p>
<p>Being seated, I asked her to favour me with her commands, and
she came straight at the business with a kind of directness
pitiable enough.</p>
<p>"Madam, all the world talks of the goodness of Mrs Johnson. I am
not long a resident of these parts, but am no stranger to your
merits. 'Tis my confidence in them causes this explanation. May I
ask pardon for plain speaking?"</p>
<p>"Madam, if the subject is one I can admit of, speech cannot be
too plain."</p>
<p>"So I have been told. Accept me therefore as a plain-dealer,
Madam, and have the goodness to read what I cannot speak. But
first,"&mdash;she put her hand to her throat as if she might swoon,
and so closing her eyes for a moment, opened them clearly on
me,&mdash;"Madam, between a certain gentleman and myself have been
love-passages tending, as I believed&mdash;hoped&mdash;to marriage.
A passion that, with due regard to honour, hath been the ruler of
my life hath brought me to Celbridge, as I did think for the
happiness of both. Being arrived, I have the happiness to see this
gentleman often, and he hath had the goodness to say that no person
hath ever been so loved, honoured, esteemed, ADORED by him as your
humble servant. Yet I am told that a former attachment doth so
constrain his honour that little can be hoped."&mdash;(Her voice
broke.) "Madam, will you read this paper, and say Yes or No?"</p>
<p>I opened it, and thus read:&mdash;-;</p>
<blockquote>Madam, of your angelic goodness be pleased to answer,
are you indeed the wife of one I name not? If it be true, I will
utterly withdraw my intrusive presence. In pity, answer
me.</blockquote>
<p>It seemed many minutes I sat with this in my hand, and she dropt
on her knee at my feet, looking up in agony. Time passed and I
heard my voice as if it were another's, and strange to me.</p>
<p>"Madam, am I expected to disclose my secrets to one of whom I
know not if she tells truth? What are you to the Dean, and what
proof do you give of what you are, that I should answer?"</p>
<p>She said very low:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I had not thought of that. But 'tis very true. And, trembling
and looking fearfully about her, she put her hand inside the
whalebone of her bodice and drew out letters.</p>
<p>"I thought not these would be seen by any, but buried with me
when I die; but't is impossible you should know me for honest, and
because honour speaks in your face&mdash;read these."</p>
<p>I took them, trembling inwardly. She, poor wretch, was newer to
her trade, and was like to faint. I knew the writing.</p>
<blockquote>I will see you tomorrow, if possible. You know it is
not above five days since I saw you, and that I would ten times
more, if it were at all convenient.&mdash;Cad bids me tell you
that, if you complain of difficult writing, he will give you enough
to complain of.</blockquote>
<p>"Cad"? Then I remembered&mdash;"Cadenus and Vanessa."
So&mdash;<i>she</i> might call him by a little familiar name, but
I, never. I stopt there.</p>
<p>"Madam, have you thus writ to him?"</p>
<p>"Always of late, Madam. With a dash before it, as here you will
see the cause."</p>
<p>She pushed a letter into my hand, eager, as I thought, to
convince not only me but herself of his regard. And thus it
read:&mdash;</p>
<p>I wish your letters were as difficult (cautious) as mine, for
then they would be of no consequence if dropped by careless
messengers. A stroke thus&mdash;signifies all that may be said to
Cad at beginning or conclusion.</p>
<p>"So," says I, "a stroke means endearments. Otherwise 't is
difficult to conclude these sentimental letters."</p>
<p>"Madam," she broke out, "it means more than tongue can tell. And
since you still doubt, have the condescension to read this letter
of my own which he returned to me in rebuke. 'Twill show you our
terms."</p>
<blockquote>&mdash;Cad, you are good beyond expression. I thought
that last letter I writ was obscure and restrained enough. I took
pains to write it after your manner. I am sorry my jealousy should
hinder you from writing more love letters. Pray tell me, did you
not wish to come where that road to the left would have led you? I
am now as happy as I can be without seeing&mdash; Cad. I beg you
will continue happiness to your own Heskinage.</blockquote>
<p>I read, and was silent&mdash;reading this letter by the light of
a dead sunset. I never dared so write. There was that between them
that he had never shared with me, and yet all his old caution, as
with me. I thought not, however, so much of his feelings as of
hers, for I think his care for women is but skin-deep at-best. He
was ever willing to take the tribute of their hearts&mdash;nay, of
their lives; but should they incommode him, or trespass across the
line he hath marked&mdash;this careless liking is changed to
hatred, and he will avenge himself brutally on the weak creatures
that love him.</p>
<p>Who should know this but I&mdash;I who have lived beside him and
retained his friendship only because I have in all things submitted
to his will&mdash;silent to death? Had I anything to lose to this
unfortunate woman? No, I had lost all many a long year ago. She
still had hopes; I, none. Why torture a wretch so miserable?</p>
<p>She kneeled before me, pale as a corpse. 'Twas the strangest
meeting. I could scarce hear her voice.</p>
<p>"Madam," says she, "I have put my life in your hand; for if Mr
Dean knew that I had come here&mdash;that I had dared&mdash;O
Madam, he can be cruel to women!"</p>
<p>I strove to collect my thoughts; then heard my own voice as a
stranger's:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Madam, to your question, the answer is No. There is no marriage
between Mr Dean and me. I have no claim on him that obstructs your
own."</p>
<p>She looked up like one in a stupor of amazement&mdash;so dazed
and white that I repeated my words. Then, suddenly, she gathered
herself into composure like my own, but her poor lips trembled. I
saw in her my girlhood long dead.</p>
<p>"If I say I thank you, Madam, with all my heart and soul for
thus opening your mind to a most miserable woman, I say little.
What is left of my life shall be a study to deserve your
compassion. What would you have me do?"</p>
<p>I replied: "I think you will not fail in what honour and
conscience dictate. 'Tis not for me to say. 'Tis between you and Mr
Dean. And now, Madam, will you give me leave to withdraw, for this
hath been a painful meeting for us both."</p>
<p>"Not before I bless you with all my broken heart," she cried,
and took my hand. "For I will now tell you that, for all these
letters, I know he loves not me, nor any. I may please him better
than another in moments, but there's no security. He hath a
contempt for women that scorches, and to hurt them&mdash;but 'tis
not this I would say. I feared to find an exulting rival when I
came to you, Madam, and instead I find an angel of compassion. Sure
I read it in your eyes. In this life we shall meet no more; but in
my prayers you will be present, and I beseech you, as the last
favour, to give me an interest in yours, that I may know myself not
utterly forsook. My one sister is not long dead&mdash;I am utterly
alone in the world."</p>
<p>She could not continue, but kissed my hand, and her tears fell
on it. I told her that this meeting should remain secret, but she
needed not assurance. We embraced, and so, curtseying, separated,
she departing first. A good woman, if I have known one. 'Tis of
good women men make their victims. The ill women cannot and do not
suffer; they but repay our score. When I reached home I found her
paper still in my hand.</p>
<p>I must now be brief. Mr Dean returned, and all was as before;
but I wearied yet more of the child's play and prattle he still
continued for my amusement. He was much engaged with writing. I
thought him ill at ease.</p>
<p>I was seated by the window on a day he will recall, when he
entered pale and furious.</p>
<p>"What hath gone amiss?" I cried, starting up.</p>
<p>"This," says he, in a voice I scarce knew, so awful was it; and
laid before me the poor Vanessa's paper that I believed I had
destroyed weeks agone. O, what had I done? 'Twas another paper I
had burned, and this had lain in my pocket. 'Twas most certainly
Mrs Prue&mdash;But what matter? He had what for her sake and mine I
had died to hide.</p>
<p>"Hath that vixen dared to come anigh you?" he cried. "Hath she
ventured to disquiet my friends, the wanton jade, the
scheming&mdash;" and so on, pouring horrid words upon her that
chilled my blood. 'T was terrible in him, that he could so swiftly
change to these furies with one he had favoured, and to a rage
frightful to see.</p>
<p>I tried to moderate him, to speak for her; but nothing availed.
Finally I rose to withdraw, for he would hear nothing.</p>
<p>"But I'll break her spirit," he said, with clenched hands. "I'll
ride to Celbridge and face her with her crime&mdash;"</p>
<p>I held him back. "For God's sake, no. Have patience. She hath
done no harm, and no eye but mine saw the paper. I pitied
her&mdash;we parted friends."</p>
<p>"Then you saw her? She came?"</p>
<p>But I can write no more. He tore his coat from me, and so down
the stair like a madman; and I heard his horse clatter down the
street, while I prayed for a soul in agony, and that she might not
think I betrayed her.</p>
<p>Hours went by. He returned, still riding furiously, and told me
how he had dashed the paper on the table before her, and how she
had sunk down speechless when he so spoke as satisfied even his
vengeance. And so continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But I am resolved. Such sluts, such tongue-snakes shall not
cross my path. You have been obedient, Stella, through good and ill
report, and merit reward. I will speak with the Bishop of Clogher
and he shall marry us forthwith, though privately. And we will live
apart, for I cannot bend my will and habits to live with any woman;
but Stella shall know she is my wife, and the knowledge pierce that
&mdash;&mdash;'s heart."</p>
<p>So, at last, the words I had once died to hear came and found me
cold. Indeed, I despised them, though still I honour my friend. I
mused, while he leaned against the window, breathing heavily and
waiting my reply.</p>
<p>"It comes too late," I said. "There was a time when it had been
welcome, but not now. Also, my sympathies are engaged in a quarter
where I think a little mercy had become you. With your permission,
Mr Dean, this is a subject that shall detain us no more."</p>
<p>I pickt up my knotting as Dingley entered. He stared upon me and
went out, nor was it ever again mentioned.</p>
<p>After, she writ me a word: "Madam and my friend, I know 'twas
not your doing. That needs no words. I am very ill, and were it
possible we should meet, 'twould be my solace, but 'tis impossible.
May the happiness the good should enjoy attend you, as do my
prayers. Your grateful humble servant, E.V."</p>
<p>I answered thus: "Madam and my friend, God be with you in life
and death. The question you put to me I shall for ever answer as
then. Comfort yourself, for sure there is a world that sets this
right, else were we of all men most miserable."</p>
<p>She was dead in three weeks, of a broken heart, For me, my own
hour draws on. I have writ this paper, yet think to destroy it, and
know not what is best. No happiness lies before him in old age, for
'tis a plant he pulled up by the roots for himself and
others&mdash;alas! how many. Should I then cause him to suffer
more? He hath had the mercy of my silence for a lifetime. 'Tis not
so hard to be silent in the grave.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>III. MY LADY MARY</h2>
<h3>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu<br>
1689-1762</h3>
<p>"I thank God witches are out of fashion," observes Lady Mary, in
a letter to her daughter, when spicy gossip about her doings abroad
had been circulated in London, "or I should expect to have it
deponed, by several credible witnesses, that I had been seen flying
through the air on a broomstick."</p>
<p>Conspicuous always, she was nominated a "toast" in the Kit-Kat
Club when she was eight, occupied herself with Latin at ten, was
married when she was twenty-three, began her campaign for smallpox
inoculation when she was twenty-nine, held salons in London,
Constantinople, Brescia, Rome, and Venice, and died when she was
seventy-three, bequeathing a fortune and twenty large manuscript
volumes of prose and verse to her daughter, one guinea to her son,
and two volumes of correspondence to a gentleman in Holland, with
the request that the letters be published at once.</p>
<p>"Her family," writes Horace Walpole, "are in terror lest they
should be, and have tried to get them. Though I do not doubt but
they are an olio of lies and scandal, I should like to see them.
She had parts, and had seen much."</p>
<p>Admirers and foes alike will be pleased to note that Edward
Wortley Montagu, in the days of courtship, used to direct his love
letters to her, simply,&mdash;</p>

<b><i>Lady Mary Wotley Montague</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p>[<i>Letters from my Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, celebrated for
her Beauty and Talents no less than for the introduction of the
Practice of Inoculation for the Smallpox into England, to her
Friend the Lady D&mdash;&mdash;n in Paris. These Letters will
dispel the Mystery to the Publick of the Lady M.W.M.'s quitting
England in the year 1739.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Writ in the year 1737, Their Majesties George II &amp; Queen
Caroline reigning.</i></p>
<p>I resume my pen, my dear Madam, to acquaint you with the news of
the day, though 'tis what you scarce deserve from your silence,
unless indeed a letter have miscarried, and 'twill not surprise me
if my last hath not come to your hands, which if so, is provoking,
it being writ in my best manner. I willingly would hear from you,
was it but to say you still exist, for I begin to find myself in
the mind of the worshipper of Minerva, who, receiving no answer to
prayers and vows, discharged a pitcher of foul water in her
Goddess-ship's face, declaring he would not longer be at the
trouble to address a lady who would not be at the trouble to
listen, and she might go to the devil for him. 'Tis not however
quite come to this with me, so I continue.</p>
<p>The world riots on at its common pace, and is now come to the
pass that vice is scarce worth the pain of concealing. Yet when it
becomes the general rule, sure there is nothing so stale! Its
facility damns it, and it then must simulate some of the airs of
virtue to be alluring. Indeed, I conclude it not wholly imaginary
that, if it was made easier to be virtuous than vicious, the whole
moral balance of the universe would shift and our present monarch
and Madame Walmoden be the saints of a new calendar. 'Tis here we
need the clergy, and, for the life of me, I see not how else. They
lend a <i>haut got</i> to vice by condemning it; and if
they should disappear, vice must cease to interest and go with
them. I gave this for my opinion to the Queen and Lady Sundon, when
they were fond to discuss metaphysics, adding that the Seven Deadly
Sins required the flames of the infernal regions for their heating
and the Ten Commandments for their encouragement if they could be
hoped to flourish in the future as at present&mdash;and they had
the condescension to agree.</p>
<p>All this being so, it will give you neither surprise nor concern
to hear my Lord H&mdash;&mdash;d hath run off with his ward, Miss
Nanny Graves, leaving his lady with four children. We shall have
them back in a few months with reputations so little worse crackt
than those of the decentest among us as will not be worth the
trouble of censuring, and give neither themselves nor others the
smallest uneasiness.</p>
<p>His Majesty is happy at present in the loss of "that old deaf
woman," as he lately called my Lady Suffolk, who was once his
greatest blessing. There is much I could tell you, but think best
not to commit to paper, save that I hear from my Lord Hervey (who
is as much as ever in the Queen's confidence) of the farewell of
Lady Suffolk to Her Majesty. She lamented to the Queen that she no
longer met with the same attention from His Majesty. "I told her,"
said the Queen, "that she and I were no longer of an age to think
of these sort of things in such a romantic way, and as wishing not
to encourage it, bade her take a week to consider of the business
and give me her word to read no romances meanwhile, and I was sure
she would think better of her present concern."</p>
<p>She cares little who rules the King, so she and Sir Robert
Walpole rule the kingdom; and indeed does both with the skill of a
juggler tossing balls at Bartholomew Fair. Suffice it to say that
she is as complaisant as ever, and treats the favourites, be they
who they will, with a condescending and smiling geniality that
enables her to give many an unexpected stab&mdash;the dagger hid in
flowers. 'Tis thus, in my opinion, every sensible woman in the like
case should carry herself. 'Tis not tears and agonies that move
that sex, but good humour and composure, and thus are they left to
their follies while common sense pursues its own objects. Yet, will
a future age credit (what my Lord Hervey tells me) that our
sovereign Lord, wishing to meet the daughter of the French
Regent,&mdash;a Princess whose reputation is known to all the
world,&mdash;writ thus to his Queen, "C'est un plaisir que je suis
sr, ma chere Caroline, vous serez bien aise de me
procurer, quand je vous dis combien je le souhaite"?</p>
<p>Never was woman mistress of so much tact, nor with more need of
it. He struts like a little despot while the beggars sing in the
street:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
You may strut, dapper George, but 't will all be in vain,
We know 't is Queen Caroline, not you, that reign.
</pre>
<p>He thinks her his slave, and all his sultanas tremble at her
nod! Lord, what a world do we live in! I wonder in how many private
homes 'tis the same.</p>
<p>She is, indeed, an extraordinary woman; and for my part,
despising men and women alike for their motives, I could at this
instant form a ministry of women, with the Queen at their head, no
more silly and impudent than they who now suppose themselves to
guide the fortunes of the country. If the Gods have any relish of
humour,&mdash;and 'tis to be thought they have, else had they not
created such a miserable little crawling species,&mdash;they must
often be witty at our expense. <i>Quelle vie!</i></p>
<p>I comprehend her well. When I give my friendship and confidence
and meet with a scurvy return, 'tis not anger nor aversion it
produces in me, but a complete indifference. Was I to hear tomorrow
that Mr Wortley had a train of charmers as long as Captain
Macheath's in the "Beggars' Opera," 'twould not inflict a pang, so
long as he kept within the bounds of prudence and family decency;
and indeed, 'tis as my poor sister Gower said to me more than once:
"'Tis you, sister, for a merciless good sense that makes you
accommodate yourself without complaint to what had drove another
woman distracted." We not married two years before I had to
complain of his indifference and negligence (though no worse), and
writ him plainly to that effect, concluding in the words that, as
this was my first complaint, so it should be my last. I kept my
word, and he his course, and we now correspond with good temper on
family interests, and no more.</p>
<p>But since I have spoke of the "Beggars' Opera," know that I have
myself become possessed of a Polly lovelier than any Lavinia Fenton
that ever played the part. 'Tis a romance&mdash;heaven send it go
no further! Here is the first chapter.</p>
<p>Being some weeks since at Twicknam, I did not see company
awhile, owing to my cousin's death; for though, as I writ at the
time of my father's, I don't know why filial piety should exceed
fatherly fondness, and still less cousinly, still there is a
decency to be exprest in black bombazine and retirement. Besides, a
thousand nothings kept me engaged. I passed a part of the time
writing satires upon the little crooked viper of Twicknam,
Pope&mdash;that may appear one day with a decoration from my Lord
Hervey's pen; for Pope's last lampoon on me is a disgrace to any
nature above that of a baboon. So all was pastoral and
tranquil.</p>
<p>But, as the Fates would have it, walking one day by the river
and (I suppose) pulling off my glove, I lost the diamond ring that
was my mother's,&mdash;the plainest thing and such as may be found
anywhere,&mdash;a ring about the finger, of small brilliant sparks.
'Twas not the value, which is nothing, but I returned home in a
scold with my woman Pratt, that was walking behind me and thinking
of nothing but her face, which some commending have turned her head
or she must have seen it fall. She is a fool, even for her nauseous
class. Seeing nothing better to be done, I caused notices to be
writ and stuck about the village that a Lady of Quality having
dropt her ring etc., would give a reward. And having wrote of my
loss to Mr Wortley, my son, and a few friends, fixed my mind with
my usual good sense that I would see it no more.</p>
<p>For upwards of a week nothing took place. I was seated in the
garden with my tent-stitch, when out comes Pratt to say a young
woman requested an audience of me. I was vexed to be disturbed,
having on my mind a letter that morning received to say that young
rake, my son, was run off from Hinchinbrook and none knew
where&mdash;but you are no stranger to his behaviour. I therefore
sent word by Pratt that I could not see her, well knowing she would
add any force to the information that my words lackt. But I was
vexed to the blood by my young rogue, knowing not where to find
him, and suspecting sonic low haunt in the Fleet.</p>
<p>To my astonishment returns Pratt presently, flouncing and
bridling, and with her a young woman&mdash;Heavens! No, but one of
the nymphs of the Thames, or rather, for they are somewhat oozy
hereabouts, a dryad of the Richmond woods, indeed as beautiful a
person as ever I saw in my life. There is not one of our reigning
girls to be compared with her for a moment and even my Lord
Hervey's Molly Lepel would vanish beside her, nor could Paris have
any doubt where to bestow the apple. I am an amateur of beauty and
can't forget your Ladyship's praise of my commendation of the fair
Fatima, saying you never before knew one fine woman do such justice
to another. So here I repeat myself.</p>
<p>This fair creature was drest in a plain suit of minunet that had
seen better days, and a straw hat tied with ribbons over a cap of
thread lace. But her eyes! large, black, and languishing, they
would have recalled to me those verses addrest to the daughter of
Sultan Achmet,&mdash;</p>
<pre>
Your eyes are black and lovely,
But wild and disdainful as those of a stag,
</pre>
<p>but for the fall of lashes that hid their soft fire; her hair
raven-black, a bloom I never saw equalled in this country, and her
lips a veritable scarlet and shaped for every sweetness.</p>
<p>Thinks I&mdash;'t is well the Duke of Wharton and his club for
gallantry can't see this paragon, else&mdash;but I leave the rest
to your discretion, for your Ladyship knows "Sophia" as I call him,
as well as I. However, the agreeablest girl in the world came
forward and dropt a curtsey, with her eyes on the ground, and
offered my ring, excusing herself on the scruple that she must
needs give it into my own hand&mdash;and all this in a voice like
music.</p>
<p>I leave you to guess if I was pleased, for the ring was on my
mother's hand when she died, and 'twas so prettily tendered,
too.</p>
<p>"Well, child, I thank you for your pains," says I "and will, of
course, be answerable for the reward, but give me leave to add
that, if I can serve you in any other manner, 'tis not my custom to
leave service forgot; if I am not mistook, your mind is not as free
from care as a well-wisher could like to see it."</p>
<p>Indeed, there was an air of melancholy about her which moved me
prodigiously, and seeing Pratt flouncing and bustling in such a
manner as denoted her curiosity and jealousy, I dismist her to the
house. She can't endure a face that eclipses her own curds-and-whey
skin, and lookt upon my little thread-satin beauty with a true
court malice. I was, however, really desirous myself to know what
had brought so much beauty to misfortune.</p>
<p>"Madam," says she, "my story is so common that it needs not
detain your ear. My father was a rich Turkey merchant, and I wanted
for nothing that money could buy. But he was bit by some scheme for
making more, three years since; a scheme he compared&mdash;alas,
too late!&mdash;to the South Sea Bubble itself. And in this he lost
all, and I had the pious duty to support him by my needleworks.
However, he sunk under his miseries into a melancholy that deprived
him of life two years since. I nursed him to his last sigh and
then, desiring to lead a life of virtue, I entered the family of
Mrs Lamb, the Levant merchant's lady and a cousin of my father, to
care her children. She carried them down here for an airing, and
walking with the little misses yesterday, I found this ring and
have the happiness to restore it."</p>
<p>She spoke with a propriety I can't describe, and curtseyed to
retire. Indeed, my dear Lady D&mdash;&mdash;n, you had yourself
been seduced into the step I next took, though how far 'twas
prudent, I leave you to judge, allowing the uneasiness beauty
causes, go where it will.</p>
<p>"Child," says I, "I thank you, and as for the reward&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stopt me with a simplicity and integrity that could not but
confirm my first opinion.</p>
<p>"'Tis not possible, Madam, I should accept it for an act of
honesty common to all decent persons. Refuse me not that privilege,
and permit me to retire, with thanks to your Ladyship for so
encouraging a reception."</p>
<p>Again she curtseyed, but I detained her. 'Twas truly a pleasure
to see so charming a creature.</p>
<p>"Child, if not possible I should serve you in one way, it may in
another. If the question be not disagreeable, are you happily
placed with this city lady?"</p>
<p>Her fine eyes moistened.</p>
<p>"No, Madam. Not but what Madam means well, but she possesses not
an easy humour, and Miss Nanny, Susan, Betty, and the rest are hard
to be controlled. I receive but my clothes and food and 'tis very
true&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stopt what she would have said, with all the easiness of a
girl of quality, but a modesty they have exchanged for the
paint-pot and whitewash in which they now blaze out. What she did
not say left much to be guessed. 'T is certainly these rich city
folk for an illiberality of mind and petty spitefullness that
inflicts countless stings on their dependants. 'Twas a weakness, I
own, but it then came into my mind on a high point of generosity
(with which I am sometimes took like a colic) to do what I could
for the poor creature. 'Twas to be seen she was educated, and she
presently confirmed my belief that she could read, write, and cast
accompts to perfection, and was skilled in needleworks and
household management. Her expectations of payment did not run high,
and 'tis but reasonable I should consider of this. So was I tempted
into what you may censure as an indiscretion, and said I was in
need of one to overlook my family of servants, and be about myself
and my girl, who hath picked up some little grossnesses from Pratt
that I like not. Not that I would dismiss Pratt, but put this one
somewhat above her as her training deserves. 'Twas charity and
carefulness combined.</p>
<p>Sure never was gratitude more lively exprest than when she fell
on her knee and kist my hand, protesting and vowing her life should
be the monument to my goodness. And indeed, think what you will,
Madam, 'tis a girl more suited to the company of persons of quality
than to city dames that drive behind a pair of Suffolk Dumplings
with coachman to match, their own hair and portliness dressed out
in the last mode but three. For this girl fashion mattered not. I
dare to swear the more she put off, the fairer she mist appear,
even as our general mother Eve gained no lustre from her fig leaves
nor furs.</p>
<p>'Twas not till the matter was settled and she retired, that my
good sense asserted itself, and thus it said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come, Madam, what do you know of this nymph that you should be
in such haste to make yourself her guardian? Did you ever know
gratitude, or even decency, in return for a favour? And here have
you took a girl into your family that will certainly draw every
rake within thirty miles to hunt down the prey?"&mdash;"No matter,"
says my conscience (did you credit its existence, my dear Lady
D&mdash;&mdash;n? for so did not I), "if you take not pity on the
wench, she will in three years' time be chargeable to the parish,
with a brat in either hand, cast off for a newer face." 'Tis the
way of the men, and those that trust them embark their little
capital into worse than the South Sea Bubble. I resolved to keep
her very secluded and say nothing of my Polly Peachum (whose name,
by the way, is Anne Wentworth) outside the house, but indeed might
as well endeavour to stifle a promising scandal as such beauty!
However, she arrived a week later with her meagre outfit. 'Twas an
odd whim, I own.</p>
<p>Don't I see you now, saying as you read, "Well do I know the
sequel. Mr Wortley comes up from Hinchinbrook and loses the acorn
he is pleased to call his heart to Mrs Anne." You are much mistook,
Madam, and was it to be she, I had as soon that as another, for I
might thus acquire the merit with my husband which the Queen gains
with hers by choosing his inamoratas. It fell out far otherwise to
your expectations; and, but for Pratt's gruntings and grumblings
about cuckoos picked up in the street, which Mrs Anne bore with
smiling patience, I had vaunted every day my good fortune in
lighting on such beauty and merit.</p>
<p>My first alarm took place when Molly Skerret comes down one day
and sees her engaged over the lace ruffles of my
<i>neglige</i>. Says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Are you mad, Lady Mary, that you will needs have a beauty about
you like yonder? All the men will be running after her. She is a
close resemblance to Sally Salisbury, that hath been the
rage&mdash;she that some time back stabbed young Finch and fled to
France."</p>
<p>I set it down to spite, for dear Molly is no beauty herself. But
the very next day my troubles begun, for the viper of Twicknam,
happening to spy her in the garden in attendance on my girl, went
home swelling with poison and writ the following, which was handed
about all over the place and in the town.</p>
<pre>
Narcissa widely from the world retired
So soon's sne saw her slighted charms expired.
But since she still must hope another spring,
(As snakes collect their poison ere they sting,)
She chose a lovely nymph to keep her sweet,
And, willing to be cheated as to cheat,
When in her glass the glowing charmer shone,
She fondly dreamed the image was her own.
</pre>
<p>This made a great talk, which was against my wish to keep the
girl retired. But you will credit, my dear Lady D., that the malice
of this little crooked monster, who should from affinity be
conversant with the habits of snakes, would not set me against the
poor innocent wench that caused it, and I contented myself with the
caution to her that she should keep in the garden and speak with no
men but what I judged proper. I fear none the less that there may
be a difficulty in keeping her, impossible to be overcome, but will
tell you further in replying to your obliging favour just
received.</p>
<p>Before concluding this epistle, which indeed is more truly to be
called a novel, I would have you know that Lady Polden was
inoculated, together with all her family, for the smallpox two
months since, excepting only Miss Jenny, that none could persuade
from fear of the lancet. All recovered after a day or two's
disagreeables, but poor Miss Jenny catching the distemper,
supposedly at a masquerade, fell a victim at the age of eighteen,
and was buried a week last Monday in all the forms. 'Tis certain
there are those would sooner die with the approval of the doctors
than live to dance on their graves without it.</p>
<p>My daughter presents her duty to you. I have designs myself to
cross to France ere long, but will not be particular as to plans
until I am more resolved.</p>
<p>I am affectionately yours.</p>
<hr>
<p><i>(Two months later)</i></p>
<p>My Dear Madam,&mdash;</p>
<p>I know not whether I do well or ill in acquainting you with a
matter so delicate, as there is none other but my Lord Hervey to
whom I dare confide it, and 'tis but to you and to him I would be
obliged for assistance. But friendship, if an illusion, is the last
left me, and I won't dismiss it until I am compelled. 'Tis
certainly absurd that one human being should depend upon any other
for anything, for alone we are born and die, and it may be thought
the Great Author of our being intended us to walk the way alone
that conducts from the one to the other, else had he made our minds
more accessible. For my part, if truth be a merit, I can say I
never had an affection, but what I regretted it sooner or later, or
made a confidence, but what I wished it recalled. Excepting in one
case, which I leave to your discernment. And such is my vexation at
this minute that, was I to be born in another incarnation as
Pythagoras pretends, I would be a foundling, indebted to none who
could exact repayment of the gift of life forced upon an unwilling
victim to please the humour of others.</p>
<p>If I write a little bitter I know your kind cpncern will excuse
me in view of what I relate. I am extreme annoyed and fluttered,
yet would not be a vain lamenter neither. Life is still endurable
when met with an easy common sense, and this I call to my aid on
this occasion.</p>
<p>I had a mind to return to London about a month since, when word
came that my young rake of a son would come hither for a few days,
with his friend Carew. I knew not the young man, but remember his
father in the Thoresby days, and the old man now being dead, the
youth is well to pass in the world in a small way and hath
inherited the old Devon grange.</p>
<p>However, I took this as a sign of grace in my prodigal, and
desired Anne to see the rooms prepared and that she should not
attend me with my tent-stitch after dinner, as wishing to keep
flint and steel apart, which your Ladyship will admit was a
prudence to be desired. And so went down to receive the young
men.</p>
<p>You are not now to learn that Edward, with all his follies, hath
a very pleasant humour when he chooses, and a tongue not unworthy
of his family; and young Carew being very conversable and
well-featured and full of odd stories of the authorities at Oxford
and the liberties they allow themselves under the mask of gravity,
the evening past extreme agreeably, and it was late when I left
them to their bottle.</p>
<p>Pratt and Anne Wentworth attended me to bed, and I desired the
last to put my pearl necklace into my dressing-box with the
dressing-plate, with which she complied in her obliging manner and
took the key as customary. This done, I dismist them and writ a few
lines to my Lord Hervey, and so to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day we past on the river in a water party and sillabubs
at Richmond and what not; and evening come I asked for my necklace
and&mdash;Lord bless me!&mdash;'twas not to be found. Anne, pale as
her smock, was looking in all corners,&mdash;and Pratt, also, but
with purst lips as who should say, "Your Ladyship now sees what
copies of whimsies and foundlings,"&mdash;till I was vexed to the
blood with them both, and knew not what to say next; the more so,
since I had seen Mrs Anne gathering flowers for the bowpots after
sunrise, and young Carew staring after her like a zany. I don't
doubt but what there had been a thousand sweet nothings before I
opened my window. The house was hunted in vain, and all the comfort
Edward could give me was the assurance of his father's anger at my
folly in taking a stranger into the house; which is most abominably
true, Mr Wortley loving to find fault and invent it where not
found.</p>
<p>By this time Pratt was weeping like a crocodile, and the Bow
Street runners sent for to come and take particulars lest the
pearls be sold in Drury Lane. Indeed, my dear Madam, I could not
close an eye for vexation, and to complete it could not but remark
that young Carew kept casting sheep's eyes at Mrs Anne that looked
as lovely as a weeping angel, could such be supposed. How different
are tears in one woman and another! Pratt, her nose inflamed, her
eyes scarce visible in swelled lids, might have been exposed to the
Duke of Wharton and his "Schemers" without an ounce of virtue lost
on either side; whereas Anne, with the liquid pearls hung on her
lashes as if to replace the lost ones, was a dish for the Gods.
'Tis no manner of use to scold the Fates for what they give or
withhold; but I swear 'tis easy known they are women, such
favourites do they make without reason.</p>
<p>We returned to London without loss of time, and the young men
remained on in my family for awhile&mdash;a course I took because
the investigators are such filthy drunken beasts as I would not
bring myself to endure their presence, and thought it more fitting
that Edward should direct them. 'Twas more than a week ere they
returned, with the news that pearls answerable to the description
were sold at a receiving "ken" about Drury Lane. My blessed
offspring, who (by the way) is grown extreme handsome, endeavoured
to learn more certainly, but was told with surprising impudence
that they were likely out of the kingdom by this time. The wretch
that kept the place was took in custody and closely questioned; but
naught could be got from him but that a young madam whom he
supposed a nymph of Drury Lane had sold it, saying she had it from
her young cully of a lover, and she would not have the sale known
for worlds, but had occasion for the money. Asked to describe her,
he said so many were his dealings as he took no particular heed
beyond that she was handsome, and a way with her, says he, that
would whistle a bird off a bough.</p>
<p>God forgive me&mdash;'twas not wonderful I looked at Mrs Anne,
and the thought came in my mind how little I knew but her own
story, and my own folly that took up with a stranger on what I
might call a mere spasm of liking. She saw it, for she hath a gift
of reading faces, and says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your Ladyship, I am sensible that suspicion is like to rest on
me, for Mrs Pratt is some time in your family and I but new come.
This is a hanging matter, Madam, and I beseech you have so much
pity for a poor girl as permit me a few days more before I am
handed over to these cruel men. 'Tis the bare truth that, so far
from stealing, I would give my life to repay the debt I owe your
goodness. And sure I that restored a jewel unasked am scarce to be
now held guilty. Have pity upon your poor girl, Madam! and delay
but till Mrs Lamb and her family return from the Wells to speak for
me."</p>
<p>'Twas so well exprest and carried so much truth that, though I
called myself a thousand weak fools, I could not refuse her, and so
set a week and lamented my own weakness in regard of beauty, that
might be a man for the sensibility I have for it but that I detect
their little cunning tricks. I know not how I am so oddly made up,
unless it be the merciless good sense of which my poor sister Gower
complained; but I am no more like to believe a woman ill-behaved
because she is handsome (as women do), than to think her innocent
(as a man would do) for the same excellent reason.</p>
<p>Some more days past, and I had other cause to regret my course;
for passing a door ajar, I looked through the crack, hearing
voices, and found Mrs Pratt conversing very much at her ease with
my prodigal&mdash;a thing which, though well enough in Congreve's
comedies, is what I will not have in my family. I am so ill-bred as
to be quite insensible to the romantic nights that are now the
vogue and, walking into the room, spoke my mind, desiring Mrs Pratt
to be so good as pack her boxes and depart within the hour, which
was accordingly done, I having her boxes looked through ere she
went, so much assurance awaking my suspicion that perhaps she could
tell more of the pearls than anyone, if so disposed. However,
nothing found, and so off she went in a sulky silence, my son and
heir talking very high and railing upon me for injustice. He took
himself off next morning with young Carew (who however behaved very
genteelly throughout), saying as he flung away, that God only knew
but they might next be suspected, and they had better depart while
their characters were safe. You know the silly cant he is apt to
talk as well as any.</p>
<p>I was fluttered and wearied when they departed, and had, what is
rare with me, a touch of the vapours; but there was Anne, hearing
me come up, and did all to support me that a feeling heart and good
sense could dictate. Will your Ladyship credit me when I tell you
the poor girl had had good reason all along to suspect Mrs Pratt
might have a hand in the thievery, but would not speak as knowing
nothing for certain, and sparing to trouble me with the
understanding she surprised between Pratt and my young gentleman.
Her good sense and heart were a cordial, and I drew a little
consolation in considering that I would now retain her about my
person and enjoy a little peace in a worthy attendant. For, though
I have known no instances of honour and integrity but among those
of high birth, still there are exceptions, no doubt, to be found to
any rule. So resolving, I sat down to write to my rake that I had
sufficient reason to think his Dulcinea might know more of the
pearls, and to request he would oblige me by using his best
endeavours to trace them.</p>
<p>What a bubble is hope! Two days later comes a letter from young
Carew, expressing himself with decency and respect, to tell me that
with my permission he had made up his mind to marry Mrs Anne
Wentworth, who was not unwilling to hear his suit, since he knew
not where else he could find so much beauty coupled with good sense
and modesty. He doubted not but I would approve his resolution.</p>
<p>'Twas somewhat of a blow. I had come to like the girl about me
as a lap dog or any other little fondling. Her every look was a
caress, and her voice as soft as violets. Also she hath mended my
girl's manners of a hundred little indelicacies gathered from
Pratt's pertness. I had willingly kept her, but 'twas not to be.
What! shall a young beauty refuse a comfortable home and other
matrimonial delights for a lonely woman! Not she!</p>
<p>I gave them what, by courtesy, may be called my blessing, and my
suit of blue lutestring to Mrs Bride, and she threw herself at my
feet, and I actually came near shedding a tear to see her
overflowing gratitude. 'Twas worthy such a set of verses as Pope
writ when the rural lovers were killed in each other's arms by a
stroke of lightning.</p>
<p>No doubt Carew is a fool&mdash;yet I think a wise one. She will
play him no tricks and stratagems, and will be a fair Lady
Bountiful in his moated grange, and will care her children and the
poor, and con possets and caudles with the parson's
wife&mdash;Pshaw! what sickly stuff do I write that should know
better. 'Tis liker she will play him false in a year, with some
booby squire that rides to hounds and swaggers in with his boots a
mass of mud to drink himself silly after a dinner of roast pig. And
for me, I have replaced her next day with a Mrs Susan&mdash;the
Duchess of Montagu's late woman, that hath all the pertnesses and
the tricks of her trade.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;'tis the way of the world. Set not your heart on
anything. A hard heart that values nothing is the only wear, and
'tis evident Scripture so enjoins it. My glass tells me I am still
a personable woman, and 'tis open to me to find amusement in making
a lover&mdash;and myself&mdash;happy if so I choose&mdash;and if
'twere not so dull a pastime. And there is crimp and quadrille for
the asking, and the new game that is just come up.</p>
<p>Horace Walpole is crossing the Channel and will give this to
your Ladyship's hand. And the favour I would have of you (in all
secrecy) is this&mdash;that you would cause enquiry to be made with
caution at Breguet's in the Rue des Moineaux, whether he hath had
lately any sale of pearls from England. 'Twas a thing spoke of as
not impossible, that they should find their way there, for I hear
from H. W. and others that the man is a well-practised receiver of
such goods from England. But with caution, I entreat, and with no
mention to H. W., for I begin to have an anxiety that I have not as
yet mentioned to any.</p>
<p>Pray be so good as send your reply by special hand. I await it
uneasily. It may be that I have the spleen, but though I have done
with knight-errantry for distrest beauty, I wonder sometimes
whether my little Anne Carew have not a happier fate than any woman
of fashion. 'Tis but a modest grange in Devon; but those two simple
souls will taste of happiness there and in each other, and the
world will not trouble them. The seasons will come and go, and when
they lie in the churchyard 'twill not be with tons of marble and
scutcheons of lies above 'em, but with nature's covering of snow in
winter and leaves and flowers in summer. They'll sleep the sweeter.
I would willingly have her with me still. Present my compliments to
our Embassador. I may yet have to ask his good offices, but am
still in hopes to avoid this.</p>
<p>Your Ladyship's most affectionate, as ever.</p>
<hr>
<p><i>(A month later)</i></p>
<p>My Dear Madam,&mdash;</p>
<p>Herewith the end of the romance I have inflicted on your
obliging attention, and I am now to tell you your comments were
fully justified and I have writ myself down an ass and invoked as
fine a lampoon as Pope could write in gall and vinegar. "Sappho"
will be as nothing to it, and indeed that I, that know the world or
should know it, should behave so like a country bumpkin new come to
town is gall and wormwood to myself. I cannot hide from a friend
what all the world will soon ridicule, and had sooner you heard it
from me than another. Was you to reproach my folly as I deserve,
you will write volumes and I promise to read with seasonable
humility. Sure I must be falling into premature dotage.</p>
<p>I was at Twicknam again, somewhat ailing with My common swelled
face, when I was told Mr Carew would see me. I refused, but he
would take no denial and indeed forced his way in&mdash;so pale
that I could expect nothing but the worst news of my son and
implored him to speak. 'Twas some time and took a dram to restore
him before he could answer, what with his haste and fluttered
spirits. But when he did&mdash;'twas to tell me Madam had flown the
day they married. The ceremony was scarce over and they returned to
the house, when, making some excuse, she slipt from the room. He
waited as long as a bridegroom's patience would hold out and
followed her; but found she was nowhere to be seen. Your kindness,
Madam, will conceive the horror with which he searched everywhere,
but could get no news. The least he could suppose was that she was
murdered for the diamond ring he gave her on the occasion.</p>
<p>At the last he had recourse to the law, and what a discovery was
there. Who think you was my paragon&mdash;the compendium in little
of all the female virtues? Why, Sally Salisbury's niece! and the
equal of Sally herself for worthless good looks and behaviour. She
is not yet well known to the town or I could not have been so took
in. But you will recall that Molly Skerret observed the likeness to
that drab Sally on seeing her. Good Heaven, that I had heeded, and
not harboured the slut!</p>
<p>Yet there is worse to follow, and I know not how to tell such
folly, but must do so. She is the wife of my son, whom indeed I
knew capable of any wickedness short of robbing his mother. He
picked the hussy up in the Fleet and wed her, and then, being in
debt, the thought struck the promising pair that my jewels might
meet their needs. He took advantage of the loss of my ring to have
it copied, and the rest followed easy with a fool like me.</p>
<p>"But I beseech you, Madam," says poor Carew, shaking in every
limb, "that you would have the goodness to review your jewels,
since the only way I can reason upon her continuing with you and
pretending to accept my addresses was to take time while Mrs Pratt
was under suspicion to make off with more and keep you easy about
them. The pretended love-affair with Mrs Pratt was plainly to be a
false scent."</p>
<p>I sent for my cases, and find my chain of diamonds, my gold etui
set with diamonds, my Turkish clasp with emeralds, and other things
disappeared with my Venus. I enclose the list and description, for
I learn Miss Sally Salisbury is now in Paris, and it is probable
that her niece and nephew (my son) have joined her or committed the
jewels to her good offices. I am ashamed to give your Ladyship such
trouble about this trifle, yet beg your obliging enquiries in the
Rue des Moineaux or where else your Lord may suggest. But by all
means keep it from Horace Walpole. I want not his bitter tongue to
lick my sores. 'Tis of course certain we cannot use the law,
considering who is involved&mdash;a point Madam no doubt laid her
account with when she carried through the plot.</p>
<p>Lord, when I think of my sentiment wasted on the arrant hussy!
My green churchyards and Lady Bountifuls and all the praise of
simplicity and parade of folly that took me because of a pretty
face and arts from the gutter. Well, 'tis the miserable truth that
this young fool (who sure must get it from his mother) did wed this
slut at the Fleet two years since, and hath damned himself for
life. He is now as weary of her as is to be expected, and besought
me to deliver him from the consequence of his folly. Beside that
fact the affair of the diamonds seems shrunk, for nothing can be
done, nor does he deserve it. He whines like a whipt dog in his
letters.</p>
<p>I would my father had lived to see the soundness of Mr Wortley's
reasoning, when he refused to entail his estates upon a future
child of whose vices and disposition he could know nothing. 'Twould
certainly be the young gentleman's utter ruin had he money to
handle in reversion. I will not trouble you with the number of
falsehoods he has stuft into his letters.</p>
<p>I have trained myself to fortitude, and go about with as many
knives stuck in my heart as our Lady of the Seven Dolours that I
saw in Vienna, but make much less display of them. The best news I
could have at this moment would be the young villain's death, for
the misery he will yet bring upon himself and others is too
certain. For Madam, she will doubtless be heard of yet in a manner
that the decency of my sex obliges me to soften. I doubt they will
both end on the gallows, though indeed her face will probably save
her that or any penalty.</p>
<p>Well, I have done with such fragments of a heart as I had, and
wish it may never trouble me more. I am sick of the cant of
sentiment and duties and suchlike, which is the mask men use to
cover what will not bear considering. Let me write of it no more.
The open wickedness of the world we live in is preferable to
hypocrisy and cringing. I will rather laugh with others than be a
laughing-stock. I sicken at this complication of folly and falsity.
I go to the Bath shortly, and look for change and pleasure there,
though Mr Wortley speaks of passing through on his way to Bristol,
I know not for what. Lord Hervey is resolved to come there, though
I fear it will not please his lady, who seems resolved to keep so
general a blessing to herself, which is more than she or any can
hope. She takes it, however, with easy good sense, and wisely, for
there's nothing on earth, I protest, worth a tear.</p>
<p>The rage for cards runs higher than ever, and let me conclude my
romance and this long paper with a pretty parable of them that is
making the round of the town. Will your Ladyship guess the author?
'T is called "The Goddesses of Chance."</p>
<p>"There was long since in the Moon four Goddesses. One was the
Queen of Riches, the second the Queen of Love, the third the Queen
of Power, and of the fourth you'll hear anon. 'Tis to be supposed
the fourth received the most homage; for a thing known loses its
value, as when a man despises his own wife and thinks Lord M.'s a
descended Venus, when, was the case reversed, his own would be his
object.</p>
<p>"On a certain day these ladies, being, after all, women,
disputed between themselves on a point of precedence.</p>
<p>"Says the Goddess of Riches, jingling her diamonds:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I come first with all. I am worshipt in every polite country,
and even the blacks fight over the shells that are their coinage. I
give not only gold but all it can buy, inclusive of such bagatelles
as love and honour, and all the other little nothings men cry up
when they have a mind to be droll. I need give no examples though I
might cite the late marriage of my Lady M. E. at the age of fifteen
to a wealthy lord of seventy-five that shall be nameless.
Undoubtedly I am Queen of all.'</p>
<p>"'Not by any means,' says the Goddess of Hearts, adjusting her
crown with a simper. ''Tis I am supreme. 'Tis known a young rake
will sell his last estate to win a smile from Miss Sally Salisbury
and other worthy ladies. And hath not the Countess of
H&mdash;&mdash;t lately run off with her footman? I lead statesmen
and kings by the nose. Many such moral examples could I give if
needful.'</p>
<p>"The Goddess of Power, brandishing her club with a brawny arm,
then replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I beg your Ladyships would cease twattling when 'tis in my
power with a crack of my club to silence you all. I leave you to
judge whether anything in life is so powerful as what can end it.
What's love when a crack on the sconce can kill it, or riches when
a blow can turn it over to the grimacing heir-at-law? No, no,
ladies. Strength comes first, and this was seen when the Strong Man
was at Bartholomew Fair and half the beauties ran after him and
poured their gold in a perfect Pactolus at his feet. Show your good
sense, therefore, by a discreet silence.'</p>
<p>"But still they disputed, and at last the fourth
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Sisters, let us descend to earth, that we may settle the
question which I see not how else to conclude.'</p>
<p>"'But how shall we go?' says the three at once.</p>
<p>"'We will go as the Queens of Chance, and men may sport with us,
play with us, revile us, men and women alike. And they shall sell
us their honour, love, and whatever else they have marketable, and
on the day of Judgment we four will see whose bag is fullest of
their commodities. 'Tis the only way to settle the dispute. And in
the end all shall come to me.'</p>
<p>"And the three said: 'And who are you, Madam?'</p>
<p>"And says she: 'With my black spade I dig the earth where all
shall lie. 'Tis I will be the Black Hag of the Pack, and you shall
strip them and I will dig their graves. Be it known to you that I
am Destiny herself.'</p>
<p>"So they came to earth, and are the Queens of Diamonds, Hearts,
and Clubs. But if the Queen of Spades be in your hand, say the
gambler's prayer backward, for she is the chance you can't reckon
in the game, or in life or death."</p>
<p>I think it neatly turned, whoever did it, and I declare this
little writing hath so affrighted the fine ladies, that Mrs Murray
swooned away at the Duchess of Manchester's, finding the Queen of
Spades in her hand at commerce, and was forced to be revived with
strong waters. His Grace of Wharton, known to you and me as
"Sophia," hath given up cards altogether, though whether it be the
parable, I know not. And the viper of Twicknam is so jealous that
he did not himself write this piece, that he spews his venom in all
directions, in hope some will settle on the author. His pleasure to
scourge alike the follies and virtues of mankind is, for aught I
know, the liveliest this world affords. The follies are, at least,
inexhaustible, and none need be at a loss for amusement that can
taste them, whether in themselves or others.</p>
<p>The Queen, who I can't undertake to commiserate for bad health,
so hard a life as she leads, hath had the unspeakable blessing to
see her lord return from Hanover, after a storm which induced his
faithful subjects to believe they had lost him. Will your Ladyship
credit that the wits affixed a paper to the walls of St. James's
Palace with, writ on it, this following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lost or strayed out of this house, a man who has left a wife
and six children on the parish. Whoever will give tidings of him to
the churchwardens of St. James's Palace, so as he may be got again,
shall receive four shillings and sixpence reward.&mdash;N.B. This
reward will not be increased, nobody judging him to be worth a
crown."</p>
<p>Impudence indeed! But I hear from Lord Hervey that she is
counselled by Sir Robert Walpole to invite Madame Walmoden hither
from Hanover, to amuse his leisure. 'Tis done as you might throw a
bone to a dog, while Her Majesty and the Walpole pursue the
business of governing. I have no sort of liking for either, but
own, had that woman been a man, she had been a great one, so
entirely does she subdue her heart and all the femininities in her
to what her reason demands. When she dies, and it can't be long
first, from what I hear, the fool she leaves will drift like a
stick in a stream.</p>
<p>Well, I sicken of England and of the town and the wits and all
else. My mind is made up to quit this country ere long, and seek
peace abroad, where I found it when I was younger than I am now.
Folly! I tell myself so, and yet I will do it, when one or two
businesses I must attend on are finished. 'Tis not that I am a
lamenter over that I have told you. I care not what happens to my
prodigal, and had sooner be out of hearing of his doings. When a
cup is broke, throw it from you and think of it no more. But
whether 'tis the spleen or the vapours, I have a mind to cross the
water and seek a new earth, if not a new heaven. Here I am in
neither, but in purgatory. Quelle vie!&mdash;'Tis what I say
daily.</p>
<p>Adieu, my dearest Madam&mdash;may it not be long before we
meet.</p>
<p>Inviolably yours,</p>
<p>M. W. M.</p>
<p><i>(The son of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was the misery of her
life, and it is the historic truth that he made much such a
marriage as I have described. It is said he turned Mohammedan after
the death of his parents. A portrait of him in a most aggressive
turban is in existence. The reason for Lady Mary's leaving England
in 1739, and returning only to die in 1762, has never been

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>IV. THE GOLDEN VANITY</h2>
<h3>A Story of the First Irish Beauties<br>
The Gunnings</h3>
<h4>Maria Gunning<br>
<i>Countess of Coventry</i><br>
1733-1760<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Gunning<br>
<i>Duchess of Hamilton and of Argyll</i><br>
1734-1790</h4>
<p>"'Tis a warm day," remarks George Selwyn in a letter to Lord
Carlisle, "and someone proposes a stroll to Betty's front shop;
suddenly the cry is raised, 'The Gunnings are coming,' and we all
tumble out to gaze and to criticize."</p>
<p>The two lovely sisters from Roscommon in Ireland, introduced by
their beauty, were the sensation of fashionable England in 1751.
Maria, a year the elder, was the more dashing and at first the more
conspicuous of the two. She became Countess of Coventry, and died
at twenty-seven. Elizabeth married the Duke of Hamilton, after his
death, refused the Duke of Bridgewater, but later married the Duke
of Argyll. Four of her children were Dukes, two of Hamilton and two
of Argyll.</p>
<p>So much Irish luck and beauty kept the Gunnings constantly in
the centre of court affairs. A poem celebrating their conquests was
entitled, "The Grand Contest between the Fair Hibernians and the
English Toasts."</p>
<p>The Queen of the Bluestockings said of them, when she saw them
together, "Indeed very handsome; nonpareille, for the sisters are
just alike take them together, and there is nothing like them."</p>

<br>
<b><i>Maria Gunning</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p>It was the year of grace 1750, and old Mother Corrigan sat
outside her door in Slattern Alley, smoking her short black pipe
with a relish; and't was a good day with her, for she had told his
fortune that morning for Squire Tyrconnel, on his way to fight a
duel in the Phcenix Park with Lawyer Daly; and when it was
finished, says she to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let you count the buttons on his body-coat, your Honour, and
fix the third from the top in your eye. And when you stand up to
him, say a prayer and pink him with your swordeen in that very
spot, and the Lord grant him a bed in heaven, the old villain, for
he'll never be asking one on earth again."</p>
<p>And as she said, so it was, and old Daly turned up his toes and
never spoke more, when the Squire got him in the third button. And
an hour after, Squire Tyrconnel sent his purse with five golden
guineas in it, and a pound of the best rappee to be found in the
Four Courts, and all for Mother Corrigan, and she was a proud woman
that day. Her house was stuffed as full of money as an egg of meat;
but no one would think it to look at her; for she had it all hid
away like an old fairy, so that no one would give a thought to
it.</p>
<p>She was sitting at her door at the top of Slattern Alley where
it turns into Britain Street, and she in the best of good tempers,
when a lady came by with two young daughters beside her&mdash;a
tall woman, with a fine blossoming colour in her face and an air
like a peacock spreading his tail and her eyes as clear as spring
water. It would be hard to see a finer woman of her age in a day's
walk, and all the gentlemen going to and from the Castle must turn
to have another look at the three of them. Her dress might be
handsome at first sight; but, closer, you could see she had it held
up with pins and stitches, and a bit of good lace fell over it to
hide the wear in the front. Also, she drew her feet under her hoop,
that they might not be noticed, though they were as small as a
young child's. And so she minced along with steps like mice, for
fear of showing the burst in her shoe.</p>
<p>But for all that she held up her head like the deer in the Lord
Lieutenant's park, and her pride was enough for a queen, and too
much for a poor lady walking the Dublin streets and holding her
skirt up out of the mud.</p>
<p>But it was the two she had with her that any lady might be proud
of. There were never two such out of heaven; and sure it may be
believed, for the world has said it often enough since that day,
and will say it to the end of time. For the elder was a sweet
rogue, with hair like red gold clean out of the fire, and eyes like
a blue June morning, and cheeks like May flowers that a rose has
kissed, and lips that better than a rose would kneel to kiss one
day; and her smile lit up the street, and she tripped along as
light as a spring breeze.</p>
<p>But the younger&mdash;sure the Lord was well pleased the day he
made her face, for't was perfection's self, Her hair was a dark
brown veined with gold, and her eyes like purple violets with the
rain on them; and when she closed her long lashes 'twas like a
cloud over the stars; and her mouth, and the soft smile, and the
dimple that dipped when she laughed&mdash;a man would stand all day
to watch her and not think long. 'Tis a strange thing that one girl
will be like that, all beauty and shining sweetness, and another,
perhaps as good,&mdash;for better she could not be in her
heart,&mdash;will be a poor sorrowful little victim that a cat
would not look at in the dark!</p>
<p>And old Mother Corrigan saw them coming, and she took her pipe
out from between her teeth, and says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Halt here, my ladies, the three of you, and hear the fortune
that's waiting you&mdash;the way you'll be ready when it
comes."</p>
<p>"Fortune!" says the lady, stopping, a girl in each hand; "'Tis
the black fortune and the sad fortune that befell me since the day
the gold ring was on my finger. And I don't want to hear any more,
so I don't; for if I had more to bear than I have this minute I
wouldn't face the morn's morrow."</p>
<p>But Mother Corrigan rose up as nimbly as a woman to a dance, and
she looked the lady in the eyes as if she was as tall as herself,
and, "Come in," says she, "for though 'tis a poor place, the beauty
of the three of you will light it like candles, and 'tis here your
luck begins."</p>
<p>So they went in, and the lady said she had not so much as a
silver bit to cross her hand with, and indeed would have pulled her
daughters back; but the old woman would not have it.</p>
<p>"Leave it so," says Mother Corrigan, "what matters an empty hand
today when you'll fill the two hands of me with gold when the luck
comes that's coming? Give me your word, my lady, and I'll take it
for as good as five guineas."</p>
<p>So she gave her word to fill Mother Corrigan's hand with golden
guineas; and the two young girls were standing by, their cheeks
like burning roses for fear and hope, as the old witch caught the
lady's hand, and gabbled something that was not a prayer, and the
words came from her like a person talking in their sleep.</p>
<p>"High blood and poverty. Sure, your father had a crown on his
head and no gold to gild it with."</p>
<p>But the lady pulled her hand away angrily.</p>
<p>"Then you know who I am. What's the good of play-acting? I
guessed this would be the way of it!"</p>
<p>"I don't know and I don't care," says the old woman with a grin.
"I'm telling you what I see, and till this minute I never laid eye
on you or yours. Don't you be speaking again, for there's no sense
in that; but harken!"</p>
<p>So she told her her father was poor and proud, an Irish lord
with a castle in a bog and an old coach with the cloth hanging off
it in flitters and the plough-horses to draw it; and that he never
gave her a penny since she married, for he had it not to give. And
she told her her husband was no better, but running after the cards
and dice all day, so that all the world cried folly on her for
taking up with him.</p>
<p>"But no matter!" says Mother Corrigan, "for you did a good deed
for yourself that day you stood up with him in the church."</p>
<p>"A good deed!" says the lady, very angry. "Don't you be a
foolish old woman, and you so near your end. For I got nothing out
of it but care and crying and pinching poverty and five children
that I don't know how to put the bread in their mouths; and this
minute I'm as lonesome as a widow, for my husband is off and away
in the country, and here am I in Dublin; and if I know how to get
bit or sup for them it's as much as I do know."</p>
<p>But the old woman shook her head till her teeth rattled.</p>
<p>"Let you be easy and take what's coming. I see you sitting in a
king's house, and the walls all gilded gold, and the carpets like
moss that your foot would sink into, and riches and grandeur, and
everyone bowing down to the mother of the beauties."</p>
<p>"Well, if the half of it's true," says the lady, "the first news
should come to me is that I'm a widow; for 'tis impossible it
should happen as you say with a husband that hasn't one penny-piece
to rattle on a tombstone."</p>
<p>"You'll not be a widow for many a day, and 'tis your husband's
name brings the luck."</p>
<p>"You don't know what his name is. You couldn't If you'll tell me
his name, I'll engage to believe any mortal thing you tell me."</p>
<p>So the three looked at the old woman; but she took another look
at the hand as she might be reading a book, and:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Good-day to you, Mrs Gunning, and good-day to his Lordship's
daughter,&mdash; my Lord Mayo,&mdash;and good-day to the mother of
the two beauties that'll sweep the world."</p>
<p>And she clucked and chuckled to herself, highly diverted with
their astonishment. How did she know it? What that old woman did
not know would make but a short story. 'T was said she had
informants over the whole countryside, like a Minister of the
Crown.</p>
<p>They stared, for they were new come to Dublin, running from
their debts in Roscommon and taking the chance to pick up husbands
in the city, and there was not one there who knew them.</p>
<p>So she took the youngest girl's hand in hers and says
she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You'll marry the highest man, bar one or two, in England. And
you'll not be content with that; for when you bury him, you'll
marry the highest man in Scotland; and if I sat here till tomorrow,
I couldn't tell you the half of the riches and glory that's waiting
for you. You'll have to crawl through the black mud to get the
first; but after that 'tis a clear course, and the mud won't stick
to a duchess's gown, young Miss Elizabeth Gunning!"</p>
<p>A duchess! Elizabeth's eyes were like winter stars, they so
sparkled&mdash;they would put out the light of diamonds. She held
herself like a young poplar and says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And if you're right, old woman, or anything like it, I'll come
and see you when I get promotion, and my Lord Duke shall fill your
pockets with gold."</p>
<p>But Mother Corrigan grinned like a dog.</p>
<p>"I haven't a pocket, my Lady's Honour. My hand's good enough;
but I'll not be here when you come riding back to poor old Dublin
in yer coach and six &mdash;and now for the fairy of the
world!"&mdash;And she took the hand of the eldest, who was shaking
like a leaf and expecting to hear of a prince and his blue ribbon
at the least, and her eyes fixed on the old witch like two blue
lakes with the stars dipping in them.</p>
<p>But she shook her head.</p>
<p>"A great man, but not so big a man as your sister's." (The girl
looked jealous daggers at Elizabeth.) "A fine man, and the gold
lace on him, and velvet and silk stockings, and gold buckles
shining in the shoes of him, and a big house to live in, and fine
clothes for your back, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stopped dead, like a horse pulled up on his haunches; but
the young Maria twitched her by the raggedy sleeve.</p>
<p>"Go on. What is it? I want to hear."</p>
<p>"Don't ask me, and you so beautiful!"</p>
<p>"I do ask, and I'll have it out of you. I suppose you mean I'll
get old and ugly like yourself."</p>
<p>"You'll never be old and ugly. Them that remembers you will
remember the loveliest thing God ever made when he took clay in his
two hands."</p>
<p>"I don't know what she means," says Maria fretfully. "But sure
some women are handsome till they die. Tell us when will the luck
come, and how?"</p>
<p>"With the Golden Vanity and a woman with a man's name. And now
leave me, my three queens, and I'll have a drop to warm me old
bones and a whiff of the pipe to put the life in me. But don't
forget the old woman when the great lords is kneeling before you
and pouring the diamonds out of baskets before ye&mdash;and send
the golden guineas, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>So she went on mumbling and muttering, and that was the first
and last time the old hag told a fortune for love and not for
money. She had not long to tell any, for she died next May, and not
a soul to cry for her.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>They stepped out into the sunshine, their heads high, and scarce
a word to say to each other; for all three were thinking of the
promises as light and glittering as soap bubbles. And Maria would
not spare a word to Elizabeth, for not a woman but must walk after
the heels of a duchess, and she was all for leading.</p>
<p>"The Golden Vanity!" says Elizabeth. "Mama, what should that be?
When I'm a duchess&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't know, and most likely 'tis not worth knowing." Mrs.
Gunning was angry. Her fine brows were drawn together. "Leave
talking of duchesses, you silly fools, and go get the herrings for
tea. I have left the children too long as it is."</p>
<p>So she marched down Britain Street like a queen, for all her
burst shoe,&mdash; a shabby street it was for such
ladies,&mdash;and the two walked off to Fishmonger's Alley, and not
a head but turned to look at them.</p>
<p>"Faith, they're goddesses and no mistake!" says gay Mr
Councillor Egan, on the way from the Law Courts, with his mulberry
face and his mulberry velvet coat. 'Twas to Lawyer Curran he said
it, and in a small city like Dublin the name held, and the two were
called the Goddesses from that time.</p>
<p>Old Corrigan's words gave them courage for a while; but what can
hold up against a diet of herrings day in and day out? And that was
all the poor lady could give her family. What was she to do? Mr
Gunning had took himself off to Castle Coote, his beggarly place in
the country, where he could dice and drink in peace with the
neighboring squireens, and live off claret and the skinny fowls
that pecked about the avenue; and she had the weight of the
children on her spare shoulders.</p>
<p>'Twas about this time that young Harry Lepel, the first man they
met, in a way of speaking, fell in love with Elizabeth, the
younger. The way it happened was this. She was walking down Mount
Street with Maria, and she let fall her purse, and nothing in it
but a pocket-piece to save her gentility. Harry was strolling off
to my Lord Cappoquin's, from mounting guard at the Castle (for at
that time his Lordship lived in Merrion Square); and indeed Mr
Lepel was as fine a figure of a young man as a girl could wish to
see, in his regimentals all laced with gold and his handsome head
above them&mdash;a brown man with dark eyes. And seeing a young
madam drop her purse, he stooped for it and, coming up behind them,
saluted very stiff and offered it, and the two turned and looked
him in the face.</p>
<p>'Tis certain a man might come up a thousand times behind a
woman's back and not be startled as Harry Lepel was when he saw
them; for there never was, nor will be, two such sisters. 'Twas
like a battery suddenly unmasked; and what chance had the poor
devil that was marching up to it like an innocent? The only thing
he could do was to surrender at discretion&mdash;but to which lady?
That was the trouble. Elizabeth Gunning settled it for him.</p>
<p>"I thank you, Sir," says she, with a smile that had ruined St.
Anthony, for she was one that smiled with her eyes as well as her
mouth&mdash;a golden sunshine that the heart opened to
naturally.</p>
<p>He was stuttering and stammering. "Madam, I thank you for the
happiness of touching anything your hand hath blessed."</p>
<p>'Twas sudden, I allow; but then, so too was her beauty. At all
events, he dared no more, not having the courage, though all the
will, to linger, and was turning off when a queer thing happened.
But 'twas to be.</p>
<p>A drunken poltroon of a bargeman was coming up from Liffey-side,
lurching and yawing like a Dutch hooker in a gale; and seeing them
in a little bunch on the cobblestones, he took an anger at them in
his wooden head, and, whether purposely or not I know not, but he
elbowed up against Miss Maria and drove her into the dirty kennel;
and she gave a faint scream, for her shoes were destroyed with the
mud, and it was the only pair she had to her name. So what does Mr
Lepel do but let drive straight from the shoulder at the offender,
and in a minute the shoes and the lady were out of the kennel and
the bargeman lying there as snug as snug, and the oaths he let out
of him blackening the air like a flight of crows. So Mr Lepel,
smiling with set lips like a picture, says to the girls:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ladies, permit me to escort you to your home. 'Tis much to be
regretted the streets are not safe for beauty unattended, though to
be sure I have the happiness to profit by the circumstance. I trust
it hath been no shock to your sensibility?"</p>
<p>And, indeed, tears had gathered in Elizabeth's eyes; but Maria
was laughing like a Hebe, and looking up in his face&mdash;the
blue-eyed lovely rogue!</p>
<p>"We thank you, Sir. 'Tis what our own brother had done had he
been more than five. But while he is in the nursery, we must be
obliged to kind strangers for protection."</p>
<p>"Madam, I would not willingly remain a stranger," says Mr Harry,
very eager, and touching his cocked hat. "Permit me to present
myself for want of a better introducer. My name is Harry
Lepel."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Sir. 'Twill be remembered with gratitude. May we
now bid you farewell?"</p>
<p>Miss Maria sank down, in a curtsey so well devised that it
showed the littlest foot in the world, save only Elizabeth's. A
fortunate bootmaker later was to make five guineas an afternoon by
showing their shoes at a penny a head to the mob that gathered to
stare at them; but that time was not yet come. Mr Lepel spoke
earnestly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Madam, you can't suppose&mdash;'tis not possible I can permit
you to return alone after such an adventure. The sun sinks and the
streets are mighty ill lit. If my company is disagreeable, I can
walk ten paces behind; but otherwise&mdash;"</p>
<p>Here Elizabeth interposed, with a fine colour in her
cheek:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The company of our protector can't be disagreeable&mdash;'tis a
favour. But, Sir, I will be frank with you: we are in Dublin
<i>incognita</i>; our lodging is not equal to our pretensions to
birth; and in short&mdash;"</p>
<p>She hesitated, with her eyes dropped and the lashes like night
upon her cheek. The crimson bow of her upper lip trembled&mdash;a
seductive picture of troubled beauty. Anyhow it did Mr Harry's
business for him. He could no more have tore himself away at that
moment than he could have embraced the barge-man swearing blue
murder at his feet.</p>
<p>"Madam, these are misfortunes that may happen to the greatest,
and 'tis easy seen that in your case breeding and birth combine
with&mdash;beauty. Is it indiscreet to ask the name of the ladies I
have the honour to address?"</p>
<p>"'Tis very indiscreet," says Miss Maria, with one of her bright
side-glances; "but yet&mdash;should we withhold it, sister?"</p>
<p>"Surely not from so kind a friend." Elizabeth spoke eagerly.
"Our name, Sir, is Gunning, and we are granddaughters to the late
Viscount Mayo and nieces to his present Lordship. And when I add
that our parents have fallen into poverty, you will
comprehend&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her voice paused on a silver note, which had the beginning of a
sob; and when Elizabeth saddened, the world must sadden with her,
so lovely were her long eyes and the drooping head. Pity poor Mr
Harry! Talk of Scylla and Charybdis&mdash;he stood between the
Sirens, and could he have halved his heart (and many men have that
power), one half had gone to either charmer.</p>
<p>"Madam," says he tenderly, "I feel for your sorrows more than I
can express. Might I but have the happiness to be presented to your
mama; for 'tis the most prodigious circumstance&mdash;I am the son
of Sir Francis Lepel of Tarrington in Yorkshire, and I have heard
him speak of my Lord Mayo many a time. His Lordship stood second to
my grandfather in his famous duel with Lord Ayrshire thirty year
since. My name will not be unknown. Permit me&mdash;"</p>
<p>And again he saluted, very gallant, and the three proceeded down
the street, the girls on thorns for thinking of the dingy rooms,
and their mother down-at-heel, and the everlasting herrings
sizzling on the grate, and Lucy and Kitty screaming for their
supper. 'Twas thinking thus that Maria touched Elizabeth's arm, as
much as to say: "Shall we let him go?" For indeed these girls had a
perfect language of signs between them, elaborated in the shifts
and devices of their life; and Miss Maria, at least, was an
accomplished little schemer. But Elizabeth responded not to the
pinch.</p>
<p>"Why, Sir," says she sweetly, "the name is indeed familiar.
Sitting on his Lordship's knee, often have I heard him discourse of
Sir Francis. You are no stranger. Yet truth is best. We are poor,
Mr Lepel. My sister and I are debarred from all the pleasures of
our rank, and our only concern is how to lighten our mama's burden
if we could. 'Tis this makes us hesitate, for we can't offer you
the hospitality we would."</p>
<p>"Name it not, Madam, I entreat," says Mr Harry, trying to look
into those too seductive eyes. "God forbid I should add to your
anxieties. But had I the happiness to know your mama, whose beauty
half Ireland knows by repute, sure I might be permitted to open the
way to some pleasures. There is, for instance, a Birthnight ball to
be celebrated at the Castle&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sir, you are all goodness, but gentlemen understand little of
the difficulties of poor young ladies of quality. How should they?
We have no dresses fit for the eyes of his Excellency. Even
shoes&mdash;"</p>
<p>She permitted a foot to appear beneath the edge of her petticoat
and ambushed it again. But it had done its work.</p>
<p>"You tear my heart, Madam. But since that little marvel of a
foot recalls Cinderella's, permit me to say that a fairy godmother
smoothed the way for that young lady to a certain ball, and there
she met the prince whose throne she afterwards shared."</p>
<p>"There are no fairies in Dublin, Sir." Her voice was like
flowing honey, while the little foot so commended was bestowing a
sharp kick upon the fair Maria, and thus it said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Run ahead. Turn the corner and run like a lamp-lighter, and let
mama know what is toward. Hide the herrings. Bundle the children to
bed. Fling mama's Irish lace over her head. I can hold him fifteen
minutes. Speed!"</p>
<p>'Tis much to be said in one kick, and it takes a woman to say
and a woman to hear; but Miss Maria was a woman, though but
eighteen. She smiled like Truth's self.</p>
<p>"Sister, if 'tis not disagreeable to you to spare me, I have the
message to leave at Mrs Flaherty's, and will go forward and meet
with you at our door. Excuse me, Mr Lepel. My sister is a slow
walker and I a swift. I knew not 'twas so late."</p>
<p>Off went Miss Maria. Turning the corner, she picked up her
petticoats and legged it along like a hare at dawn.</p>
<p>It may be thought that the acquaintance ripened in those fifteen
minutes, which doubled into thirty. Elizabeth's step was slower,
her voice more musical, even as a nightingale sings her sweetest to
the moon. The shade of my Lord Mayo might hover about them to
safeguard propriety, but Mr Harry drew as near as the rampart of
the lady's hoop would permit, bending his head to catch her
murmurs, and his nostrils inhaling the faint perfume of silken hair
rolled back from the whitest brow in the world. They made a pair
that many would have remarked, but for the ill-lit streets.</p>
<p>Maria awaited them at the shabby door in Britain Street.</p>
<p>"I would not go in, sister, lest mama should scold me for
leaving you; and indeed I am but just arrived," says she demurely.
And since she had not entered, 'twas singular how neat was the
appearance of that dingy room; for 'twas dingy, do what you
would.</p>
<p>The fire burned brightly, and if there was a delicate odour of
herrings and onions, 'twas the worst could be said, for none were
to be seen. Indeed, a rich perfume fought with it, as if a hasty
hand had dashed the odours of Araby here and there to discourage
the herrings. A large velvet cloak, the worse for wear, disguised
the rents of the sofa, whereon sat Mrs Gunning, majestic in another
of faded purple satin, beneath which her dress remained
conjectural. A noble square of Limerick point was flung over her
head and hung veil-like by each ear; and, indeed, with the little
cherub Lucy at her feet, she might have sat for an aging
Madonna.</p>
<p>Kitty was bundled off to the camp-bed in the back room; and sure
the picture was homelike, if you studied the handsome lady rather
than the ragged chairs. 'Twas the best they could do, poor souls,
in fifteen minutes, and wonderful in the time. 'Tis women for quick
thinking and quick acting where men are concerned; and, indeed, the
look of astonishment Mrs Gunning gave as the three entered was
inimitable, though already she had every particular set down in her
mind. She swept the stateliest curtsey, and cast a rebuking
maternal eye on her daughters, ere she addressed Mr Lepel.</p>
<p>But, when explanations were made, how did her brow clear and a
fair-weather smile efface the frost! She welcomed him with cordial
kindness, with such reminiscences of his family as warmed his
heart; and though no hospitality was offered save one,&mdash;a
bottle of generous claret in a silver cup enriched with the Mayo
arms,&mdash;'twas given with such good-will, and served by so
lovely a cup-bearer, the fair Maria, that the man does not breathe
but must feel it worthy of the three ladies who tendered it. He
toasted them one and all in turn, and if his bow to Elizabeth was a
little lower, that circumstance did not displease Mrs Gunning.</p>
<p>"I leave you to judge, Mr Lepel," says she, "what it costs a
mother to see her dear ones exiled from all the little gay scenes
where it would become them to appear. But what can I do? My
father's grandchildren, Mr Gunning's daughters, can't appear except
with propriety; and why should I hesitate to tell so kind a friend
that 'tis beyond my power?"</p>
<p>'Twas discussed between them all for an hour as to the
Birthnight ball; but Mrs Gunning was resolute, nor could Mr Harry
dare to make the offers that trembled on his lips. He could have
groaned aloud to think on the sums he wasted nightly on
gaming&mdash;one half of which would have adorned these beauties
and set them free to flutter their wings in the sunshine of
fashion. Later Maria, half-smiling, half-sad, told how they were
promised luck by the old witch of Dublin, though she gave not all
the particulars. She built not on it, she declared, nor yet did
Elizabeth; and she, a soft sigh parting her lips, confirmed her
sister: "the more so," says she, "that none of us can imagine what
is the Golden Vanity. Is there such a ship, to be the ship of our
fortunes? 'Tis that it sounds most like."</p>
<p>He shook his head. Mrs Gunning softly remonstrated:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My dears, be not giddy, nor let your heads run on such follies.
There is no such name and no such thing and 'tis
impossible&mdash;"</p>
<p>More she would have said, but a man came crying somewhat down
the street, and beside him went another with a flambeau, that he
might read a paper in his hand, and what the man cried was
this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let the fashion of Dublin, both ladies and gentlemen, take
notice that there comes presently to the theatre in Aungier Street
the dramatic company which Mr Sheridan presents to his patrons in a
new and luscious play, by name&mdash;"</p>
<p>But here was the speaker's voice drowned by a wagon passing on
the cobblestones.</p>
<p>"What is it?" cries Mrs Gunning, running to the window; for
indeed she loved the play as well as did her girls. And, as if the
question had reached him, the man turned towards her and bellowed
like the bull of Bashan: "The Golden Vanity!"</p>
<p>The little company within stared transfixed upon one
another.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>For the next fortnight did the three live in a kind of rapture;
and 't is not to be wondered at, the name coming so pat on the
prophecy. And sure, Mr Lepel was no less moved; for he took a
deeper than brotherly interest in all that touched them, his heart
being caught that day in Dublin streets; and if he then thought
Elizabeth a beauty, it took not a week to rank her an angel. Before
the week was out, he laid his heart and the reversion of the
baronetcy at her foot, not regarding the worn little shoe that
cased it. For, indeed, the sisters wore the same size, and
Elizabeth being the better mistress of her wardrobe, 'tis to be
feared she sought often for her own, to find them gadding abroad on
Miss Maria's feet and herself left to luck. 'Twas mortifying, and
her heavenly blush was as much owing to this circumstance as to the
gentleman's ardour.</p>
<p>However, taken by Mr Harry's fine person and clothes (and which
was the most potent is not known), she accepted the heart, and he
set about to inform his father of his good fortune, for mother he
had none. 'Twas with inward quakings, for beauty, were it Helen's
own, is but a blunted arrow against a seasoned heart of seventy:
and Sir Francis Lepel had reached that discreet age. 'T was vain to
tell him of celestial eyes and roseate bloom. God help us! 'tis
little he cared for the like. The baronetcy was poor and Mr Harry
expensive, and what Sir Francis looked to was a fat balance at
Child's the banker's. Was the lady a fortune? And when Mr Harry,
trembling, avowed that a single doit could not be hoped in that
quarter, the old gentleman, his temper as well as his foot highly
inflamed with gout, swore to disinherit him if the matter went
further.</p>
<p>Poor Harry was in a sad quandary. He slept and ate ill, and
'twas provoking that Elizabeth bloomed like a rose and troubled not
her fair head about Sir Francis. Her mind seemed possessed with but
the one thought&mdash;to attend the Birthnight ball and, like the
planet Venus, shine in her rightful heaven. And indeed Mr Harry
could not fancy her heart so deeply engaged as he might wish; for
he could scarce get a word in while the two peered into the
mercers' shops, gloating on satin and muslin. Mrs Gunning, as
improvident, was almost drawn in by them, when word came of a card
debt that their papa owed to Sir Horatius Blake, and the
unfortunate lady received not even the pittance that provided
herrings for six hungry mouths; so that they were like to come down
to dry bread, which event fairly ended all talk of the ball.</p>
<p>'Tis not to be supposed that Mr Harry did not offer to set all
the mantua-makers in Dublin to work, though in his heart he knew
his own credit did not stand immaculate. He stormed up and down the
room, protesting, vowing, exclaiming; but Mrs Gunning would have
none of it. Says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I do all justice to your kind heart, Mr. Lepel, but 'tis not,
because we are unfortunate, that we have no pride, and 'tis
impossible Miss Gunning should accept garments from the gentleman
she honours with her hand."</p>
<p>And Elizabeth, lovelier than ever in grief, confirmed her
mother, Maria stamping her foot like an angry goddess. 'Twill be
admitted 'twas a hard case. And since misfortunes don't come alone,
arrived a furious letter from Sir Francis, demanding instantly to
see Mr. Harry, and acquainting him that his appointment in the
Guards was cancelled, and he must join his new regiment in London
at a day's notice. Sir Francis had good interest with the lady
whose interest with His Majesty was unquestioned, and 'tis to be
thought this event did not come by chance.</p>
<p>Oh, then were wailings and passionate embraces on the part of
Mr. Lepel, Miss Elizabeth receiving them with wondering eyes. "For
London, is not so far but we shall meet again, Harry," says she,
with her angelical smile.</p>
<p>He had preferred tears, no doubt; but a man must take what comes
his way, and be thankful. He, who had never before been guilty of
the like, now composed a set of verses of atrocious demerit.
Indeed, the first two lines will suffice:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
If from my Chloe's snowy breast I part,
Grant me to know I bear with me her tears.
</pre>
<p>"'Tis very pretty!" says Chloe. "O Harry, I would you did not
love me so! A girl's affections are cool and temperate, I
think&mdash;at least 'tis so with me. Forget me a
little,&mdash;though not too much child,&mdash;and be happy."</p>
<p>It might have been her mother who spoke. 'Tis certain no person
ever had the appearance of sweet simplicity more than Elizabeth
Gunning; but whether 'twas wholly devoid of art&mdash;Ah, well,
shall we dissect the rose? Best to enjoy and ask no questions.</p>
<p>The day of parting he came to Britain Street, and solemnly
renewed his vows in the presence of Mrs Gunning and Maria.</p>
<p>"And, O my Elizabeth," cries he, "pledge me once more that hand
which is all my joy. Swear that neither raging seas" ('twas a day
calm as milk and the Irish sea like a mirror) "nor the brutish
tyranny of man shall divide us, and that our constant hearts shall
never change!"</p>
<p>Miss Elizabeth raises heavenly eyes, a glittering moisture
enhancing their brilliance.</p>
<p>"Have I not pledged my word, Harry; and if you believe not that,
what will serve? Sure 'tis you that rove and will see fairer faces"
(frantic protestations from Mr Lepel) "yet I don't doubt
<i>you</i>. Farewell, dear Harry, and remember us when you are in
the glitter of London."</p>
<p>She covered her face with a handkerchief, and he took the last
embrace, kissed Mrs Gunning's hand and Maria's, and hurried madly
from the room. Elizabeth unveiled her face and folded the
handkerchief for future use.</p>
<p>"He's gone," says poor Mrs Gunning, seeking her own; "and if I
know where tomorrow's dinner is to come from, for you all,
I'm&mdash;a Dutchman!"</p>
<p>They mingled their tears, and Elizabeth's were real enough now.
'Tis possible, could the matter be sifted, that many more tears
have been shed for absent dinners than absent lovers; and
certainly, though beauty may survive without the last, it cannot
without the first. There was so much of gloomy and terrible in
their mama's aspect, that Maria wept also; and Kitty and Lucy, with
the little John, who had all been secreted in the bedroom during
the adieux, dashed in screaming at the tops of their voices, as if
the heavens were falling; and so sat the poor unfortunate family
drowned in tears. 'Twas not balls they thought of then, nor
departing lovers, but simply bread and herrings.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>A lady came down the street, picking her way through the garbage
that adorned it. Her dress was hooped in the mode, and of a showy
brocade, with much tinsel interwoven and very glittering, so that
the ragged children in the gutter stood, finger in mouth, to see.
She had a muslin cross-over upon an expansive bosom, and 'twas
finely laced with Mechlin, not too clean, and set off with a black
velvet ribbon about the throat, graced with a clasp of paste. A
large tilted hat tied beneath her chin shaded an arch and sparkling
pair of eyes, which, though not in their first youth, lighted up a
face with striking features an air of easy good-humour. If her
critics had accused this lady of being somewhat too goodhumored
with the other sex, why 'twas perhaps natural to her circumstances
and needs no further excuse. Her worst detractors never denied her
a good heart, and an ear open to the lament of misery. In her hand
she carried a cane of fine ebony, and altogether appeared a radiant
vision of a fine woman in the purlieus of Britain Street. She
paused and looked about her, bewildered.</p>
<p>"I declare I know not where I am got to!" says she, half aloud.
"And these barbarians&mdash;'tis hard to be understood or to
understand their gibberish. If now&mdash;"</p>
<p>And even as the words left her lips, arose a piercing wail from
across the street, in which three lusty young throats
united&mdash;Lucy, Kitty, and John, each outscreaming the
other.</p>
<p>"Crimini!" says Madam, "what's this? Is Herod abroad in Dublin?"
The screams redoubled. She added: "'Tis almost to be wished he
was!" And stood half-laughing, half-unwilling to pass on.</p>
<p>"I will!" says she; and more doubtfully, "I won't! 'Tis not my
business. Sure I have enough stage tears and sobs to make me
distrust all I hear."</p>
<p>She turned resolutely away, and halted again.</p>
<p>"Poor lady! 'Tis a lady soothing them, and weeping herself. I
will! She can but bid me exit."</p>
<p>And so marched to the open door, and into the narrow passage,
and rapped smartly with her cane on the door of the parlour,
bringing all her natural assurance to bear.</p>
<p>Dead silence. The screams halted, as if a tap was turned off:
whoever was inside was all ears. She rapped again. And now a
scuffling; and Maria opened the door, and six pairs of astonished
eyes gloated on the stranger. And no less did hers on the party
within; for there sat Mrs Gunning, beautiful and maternal, with the
little John's curly pate on her bosom; Elizabeth, lovely as the
day, leaning on one shoulder of her mother; Kitty and Lucy,
golden-curled cherubs, clinging to her gown; and Maria, like a
sorrowful wood-nymph, holding the door. Sure, never was such a
family, and these children seemed made of some more exquisite clay
than ordinary.</p>
<p>"Lord, am I got into heaven, for I see the angels about me!"
says Madam, advancing with a reverence lower than the paltry room
demanded. "Forgive an intruder, Madam, and confer a benefit. For
being newly come to Dublin, I've lost my way returning from Smock
Alley, and while I called up courage to enter and ask it from any
other than these savages, I heard a cry that hastened my steps. Be
pleased to pardon me, and say if I can be of service to yourself
and your sweet family; for 'tis the plain truth&mdash;I'm dazzled
as I stand, by the beauty of your olive branches."</p>
<p>'Tis not possible to mistake the voice of sympathy, and Mrs
Gunning rising from her chair, curtseyed in her turn, and begged
the visitor to be seated. "Lord, Madam," says she, "you catch us
very unfit for company; but so kind a heart needs no excuse, and I
will be candid with you. We are of birth and breeding like
yourself." ('Twas a skilful compliment and the lady simpered.) "And
therefore, as a gentlewoman of quality, you shall understand my
grief when I present myself as my Lord Viscount Mayo's daughter,
and add that I have not the wherewithal to clothe or feed these
innocents! You are yourself too young to be a mother, Madam" (again
the lady simpered), "yet will comprehend a mother's anguish. I am
Mrs. Gunning of Castle Coote, and such is my condition!"</p>
<p>She wept again. The lady applied a laced kerchief to either eye.
A touching scene.</p>
<p>"Madam, a heart of marble must feel for you, and mine is not
marble&mdash;far from it. But sure such beauty must open all doors.
Marriage&mdash;" She broke off. "Alas, Madam, in these days of
money-grubbing avarice, what is beauty? My second"&mdash;she
indicated Elizabeth&mdash;"is cruelly rejected by the father of a
gentleman of birth not near so high as our own, because she has no
estates pinned to her petticoat." "Monster!" cries the lady with
spirit.</p>
<p>Mrs Gunning proceeded:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And, O, Madam, were you in want, as a lady of quality sometimes
is, of a young lady to write letters, to keep accounts, and all
those little useful arts such as mending lace and the like, I can
truly say that in my Elizabeth you would find solid worth. She is
graver than my Maria.</p>
<p>"Sure we cannot have had the happiness to meet you for nothing.
'Twas ordained you should walk in upon us. Permit me to ask the
name of our benefactress." The lady hummed and hawed a little; but
not being easily daunted, she tossed up her head bravely enough ere
she replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Gemini, Madam! We can't all be ladies of quality; and if we
could, I see not who could provide the wants and amusements of the
fashionable. To be plain with you, I am an
actress&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"An actress!" screams Maria, all rapture. "Sister, do you hear?
Was it not this very day I said, would I could go on the stage like
the famous Mrs Woffington, and other beauties such as this lady.
And then should I be happy and pour all the gold I made into my
mama's lap."</p>
<p>The lady shook her head, a little melancholy.</p>
<p>"Gold? Not much of that on the stage, young miss. 'Tis found
there&mdash;true; but&mdash;but&mdash;indirectly. However, this
concerns you not. Madam, I am in no need of such an attendant as
you describe, having my dresser and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I might have guessed it! When did luck ever come our way?
Farewell, Madam. Return to your own happiness and abandon us to our
misery."</p>
<p>Heart-rending! The lady drew nearer.</p>
<p>"Gemini, Madam! You misjudge me. A woman can but offer what's in
her power. A good word from me to our manager, Mr Sheridan, and
with such faces I doubt not small parts can be found for your
daughters in one of the plays to be produced here, even now
rehearse it, and the parts of Susan and Careless go begging, for
the girls that took them are called away by their mama's illness.
But dare I mention such a proposal?"</p>
<p>"Madam, you are all goodness and beauty!" cries Elizabeth. And
Maria fell on her knees like one distraught and kissed the pretty
hand in its black mitten. 'Twas known to them that Mr Sheridan's
company was from London and would return there; and indeed this
came like a sunburst through the cloud, for 'twas food, clothes,
admiration, money, hope&mdash;and many other charming things that
set them dreaming on worlds to conquer.</p>
<p>They swept their mama away on the wave of their delight; and
indeed that poor lady was always prone to take gilding for gold so
long as it glittered sufficiently.</p>
<p>"And what, Madam, is this play in which Susan and Peggy
appear?"</p>
<p>"Child, 'tis 'The Golden Vanity'&mdash;a play of a poor girl
that weds a rich lord and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Heavens and earth! She could not continue, for how describe the
joy and wonder of the family! Reserve fled away. Prudence borrowed
the wings of Hope, and dressed her face with rainbows. Crowding
around the stranger, they entreated her name, that it might grace
their prayers; and she, radiant with the sunshine she dispensed,
calls out:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, girls, sure you have heard it. 'Tis I am the leading lady
in all Mr Sheridan produces at present. I am George Anne
Bellamy."</p>
<p>"George!" screams Mrs G. "'A woman with a man's name,' said old
Mother Corrigan. Girls, your luck's come!" And with that falls into
strong hysterics and frights them all to death.</p>
<p>But joy is a strong cordial, and 'twas not long ere she sat up,
panting and dishevelled, with George Anne's hand in hers, telling
her the story of Mother Corrigan. 'Tis to be supposed Mrs G. had
heard that Mrs Bellamy's heart was not marble in any sense; but
what was the lady to do? For my Lord Mayo spent his rents five
years ahead, and though his good nature would give the coat off his
back, that would neither clothe nor feed her family; while, as for
Mr Gunning, that gentleman regarded his wife and children no more
than the cuckoo that leaves her offspring to chance.</p>
<p>Mrs Bellamy was all ears. 'Twas prodigious, 'twas vastly
astonishing, she vowed. Maria was sent out with half a guinea, and
they had a comfortable dish of tea, with currant bread and what
not; and she told them tales of the stage and the fine matches made
by Mrs This and Signorina That, displaying little of its threadbare
and much of its tinsel; and by the time the candles were lit, they
were all sworn friends. They parted with embraces; for Mrs G. was
as easy as George Anne, and the girls must needs follow the example
set.</p>
<p>She had her way with Mr Sheridan, who knew 'twas as much as his
play was worth to offend Mrs Bellamy; and she returned next day to
announce her success, triumphing and rattling on like a girl
herself, so pleased was she with their pleasure. All was joy and
gladness, and she named the hour of the first rehearsal and their
introduction to Mr Sheridan, who knew as well as another how pretty
faces fill the playhouse; and was proceeding, when Maria, turning
archly upon her, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look you here, dearest Mrs Bellamy! Think what it will cost us
to refuse this." And so holds up a splendid card, thick as boards
and embellished with a gilt edge and the Royal Arms and the Irish
Harp, and Heaven knows what braveries, inviting the Honourable Mrs
Gunning, Miss Gunning, and Miss Elizabeth Gunning to the Birthnight
ball at the Castle, on the part of his Excellency, the Earl of
Harrington. Diamonds were never so bright as the eyes that sparkled
above it; for the charming new prospect of the Stage had quite
effaced the ball, and poor Mr Harry's trouble in securing the
invitation was like to go for nothing.</p>
<p>"I care nothing now for it!" cries Maria, and Elizabeth echoed
her; while George Anne looked thoughtfully at the Lion and Unicorn
guarding a Paradise she could not hope to enter. Maria made to tear
the card across; but Mrs Bellamy caught it from her hand and did
not smile.</p>
<p>"Children," says she at last, "you know not what you talk of. I
would have a word alone with your mama. Take the little ones in
your hand, and go out a while in the sunshine." She thrust some
cream-cakes upon them, and they did so, looking doubtfully at her
cloudy eyes; and when the door shut, she turned to Mrs Gunning.</p>
<p>"Madam, you know well't is my wish to serve you and yours. But
seeing this invitation, there's thoughts comes into my head that I
must needs speak out. This" (she flicked the card) "is the life for
the Miss Gunnings, and not the stage. 'T would scarce become me to
tell a lady like yourself what must be faced there,
but&mdash;but&mdash;'t is much! Ask Peg Woffington&mdash;ask Kitty
Clive&mdash;ask George Anne Bellamy!" She hung her head.</p>
<p>There was silence. Mrs G. stared at her, all aghast.</p>
<p>"Why, yesterday, all your talk was of pleasure and success.
Sure, dear Mrs Bellamy, 't was not like your kindness to draw on
the poor things till they can think of naught else, and now so far
otherwise."</p>
<p>"Why, Madam, I thought there was no other way; and if so, needs
must. But seeing this, my mind misgives me and I falter. I'm a
plain-dealer, Madam, with all my faults, and 't is easy to be seen
your daughters are a world's wonder. I never saw the like, and that
being so, 't is certain the dangers are tenfold for them. They'll
see the glories and grandeurs, sure enough, but not through a
wedding ring."</p>
<p>"If you mean, Madam, that my daughters&mdash;" Mrs Gunning
flamed out, furious; but George Anne was not to be turned from her
purpose. She raised her hand in a fine stage attitude.</p>
<p>"Madam, I wish vastly to serve you. Hear my proposal. Accept
this invitation."</p>
<p>"Impossible. We have no dresses, no shoes, no equipage, and no
means to get them. 'T is absurd!"</p>
<p>"'Tis not absurd. Hear me. In the theatre properties is a fine
dress for Lady Modish and two more for Peggy and Susan Careless.
Not perhaps what such ladies might expect, but passable.
And&mdash;I know men. There's not a man will look at their gowns
for looking at their faces, though the suits are well enough when
all's said. I vow, Madam, you have so long lived beside the two
that you forget what beauties they are. I wager my next benefit to
a China orange that you'll have no more care once they are seen,
but all the women mad with jealousy and the men with love. Indeed,
your young madams are what one reads of in romances, but don't see.
Give them this chance, and if it fails, I'm good for my offer; but
I'm much mistook if you hold me to it. Gemini, Madam; use your
wits! Would you have them what I won't name, when they may be what
your old witch foretold?"</p>
<p>She smiled her charming smile, and pressed Mrs G.'s hand. The
lady pondered. 'Twas disagreeable to owe such a thing to a mere
actress, and one, too, whose reputation was a trifle flyblown. The
stage she might have swallowed&mdash;being the lady's province and
she a queen on the boards. But an entry to the world where she and
her daughters had a birthright&mdash;Fie! 'twas a very different
pair of shoes. But George Anne had that in her eye that would be
obeyed; and seeing it, Mrs G. dropped her high tone and returned
the pressure with an air of sensibility.</p>
<p>"'Twas said by old Corrigan that 'twas you to bring us luck,
dearest Madam, and 'tis certain you are prudence itself. Sure a
mother can risk nothing for her darlings. If you will ensure us the
dresses, I accept; and, indeed, my Lord Harrington's father was a
friend of my own revered father in happier days. 'T is
possible&mdash;"</p>
<p>"'T is certain," cries George Anne gaily. "Not a word will I
drop to Mr heridan, who is a perfect Israelite where theatre
matters are in hand.</p>
<p>Count on me."</p>
<p>She was gone ere the girls returned, and 'tis needless to tell
their wonder. They preferred the stage, yet condescended to say
they would favour the ball, since Mrs Bellamy counselled it. "But,
never, never will it turn my heart from the charming footlights!"
says Maria. "What say you, sister?"</p>
<p>"I know not. My taste is quieter than yours. I will tell you my
mind the day after the ball. Poor Harry&mdash;'tis he has given us
this."</p>
<p>She would say no more, but sat thoughtful.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>'Twas the evening of the Birthnight ball when George Anne
arrived, in a hackney coach, attended by her dresser, and scarce
visible for mantua boxes. The three children were put
away&mdash;their usual fate&mdash;in the beds within, and though
not able to sleep for excitement, were mute as mice, lest they be
punished by the closing of the door upon the ravishing glimpses
they had of the parlour.</p>
<p>'Tis not for a mere scribbler to intrude upon the chaste
mysteries of the toilet. Suffice it therefore to say that, when all
was completed, George Anne and Mrs. March the dresser stood back,
breathless, to contemplate the work of their hands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gunning, her fine brown hair piled on her head into an
edifice twisted with gauze and feathers that granted her five
inches more of height, looked a Roman empress&mdash;her fine bust
displayed to advantage and sustaining a necklace of stage emeralds
set in pinchbeck, which could not be told from the veritable
jewels, so closely were they copied for George Anne from her Grace
the Duchess of Bridgewater's. Her hoop was very wide, and over it a
green satin brocade flowered with gold, wherein George Anne had
played Lady Modish but twenty times, and so rich that 'twould serve
her great-granddaughter. 'Twas ruffled at neck and elbow with
Mechlin, and the girls gazed in awe at their splendid mama. 'Twas a
changed woman. She expanded, she glided, she moved, as a swan
floating through her native element differs from the same lurching
along the bank.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth&mdash;O beautiful! Sure 'twas joy to see her! Her
hair, agleam with gold, was rolled back and carried in massive
braids that crowned and bound her head in the Grecian taste,
confined by a bandeau of pearls that crossed her brow. Her Grecian
robe (indeed the fair Miss Lebeau had played Calista in it) was a
white satin with a fall of lace, and round her slender throat a
chain of seed pearl. Mrs Bellamy knew her business. 'Twas simple,
but simplicity becomes a goddess, and frills and flounces can but
distract the eye from loveliness that seems native to heaven. Her
mother surveyed her in a kind of amaze and then turned to
Maria.</p>
<p>'Twas peculiar to these two fair sisters that they adorned each
other and each appeared more beautiful when both were in company.
Indeed't was said later that this contributed much to their
triumphs. Maria now appeared in a fine India muslin embroidered in
gold wheat-ears&mdash;a robe which't is to be feared Mr Sidney of
the East India Company, the rich nabob of Jubblepore, had laid at
the feet of George Anne in pursuance of a suit not wholly
disdained. No matter! On Maria it shone like the raiment of the
youngest of the angels, draping yet expressing her fair limbs with
a seductive reserve that was art embellishing nature. She had a row
of seed pearl like her sister, and one rose of faintest pink
nestled in her virgin bosom. Her hair of burning gold was dressed
in curls <i> la mouton</i>, as Mrs March expressed
it, and a string of pearls wove through the rich tresses.</p>
<p>But 'tis useless to describe beauty. As well dry a rose in a
book and look for bloom and dew. It depends on bright eye and
smiling lip and wordless sweetness and the fall of exquisite lashes
and the tone of music and&mdash;and this poor scribbler lays down
his pen and attempts no more to paint where the great artists later
owned themselves vanquished.</p>
<p>"And all is prepared," cries George Anne, exulting. "For my
mother's job coach is at hand to take my three beauties; and
distress not yourself, my dearest Madam, for I engage to remain
with your little family will return in the coach when it deposits
you here. And now, children, peep and whisper no longer, but come
see your lovely mama and sisters before they go to conquer the
world."</p>
<p>'Twas the kindest heart! She clapped her hands, and in rushed
the three children like Bedlam let loose, careering round and about
the three, shouting, laughing, and begging to be took also. Raisins
and oranges from George Anne's reticule alone restored them to
their beds in peace.</p>
<p>"'The Golden Vanity' has sent forth two incomparable beauties,"
says she at the door as they stepped into the coach. "May it bring
them the luck of its heroine and more."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>St. Patrick's Hall was all of a blaze with wax candles and
flambeaux, and shining mirrors set in with gilt Cupids, and
twinkling of fairy lights in the great glass lustres and their
glittering chains of drops and pendants. Garlands of green, with
roses interspersed, were in swags and loops about the splendid
walls, where hung the pictures of bygone viceroys in ribbon and
star, in frames to match the mirrors that multiplied the scene a
hundredfold.</p>
<p>And, more than all, the handsomest women in Ireland were decked
out in silks and satins and all the family jewels, and they
sparkling like the lustres above their heads. And all the gentlemen
in uniforms and silk stockings showing off their fine calves, and
they strutting with their swords and squiring the ladies and
bowing. And above it all the Throne, with the velvet canopy and the
Royal Arms, and my Lord Harrington, his Excellency, sitting like a
picture of himself, with his stars and orders and his coat of
sky-blue velvet laced and embroidered with gold; and as each pretty
lady came up to him and swept her curtsey he lifted her by the hand
and kissed her cheek; for the Viceroy has that privilege, and many
a man envied him a few of the kisses, if they did not envy them
all.</p>
<p>And now at the great doors appeared three ladies, quietly, like
persons used to assemblies, though to be honest their knees were
trembling under them and their little hearts quaking. So they were
passed on from one golden image to another, until they arrived
before his Excellency, the company politely making way, and a
whisper that rose to a buzz running with them. "Lord! who are
they?"&mdash;"Who can they be?"&mdash;"Look at the
girls!"&mdash;"Exquisite!"&mdash;"Beautiful!"&mdash;"For my part I
see nothing in them. Vilely dressed. Very far from
modish."&mdash;"Too tall."&mdash;"Too short"&mdash;in fact, every
expression of approval and disfavour. But every lady stood on the
tips of her satin shoes to see, and every gentleman took the
fullest advantage of his height; and had poor Harry been there, he
had died of jealousy. Alas! even his fond letters were not in
Elizabeth's gentle bosom, but tossed forgot on the bed in Britain
Street, with George Anne casting the eye of sensibility on
them.</p>
<p>And now the officer who performed the introduction took Mrs
Gunning's gloved hand, very stately, and led her before the
Throne.</p>
<p>"The Honourable Mrs. Gunning, your Excellency."</p>
<p>Down she flowed in a magnificent curtsey, her hands supporting
her brocade on either side, her head bent majestic&mdash;Beauty
adoring Power. Suddenly my Lord steps nimbly forward on the
dais.</p>
<p>"What?" he cries. "Do my eyes deceive me? Impossible! But sure I
have the happiness to see the daughter of my old friend, and I am
honoured beyond expression to welcome her beneath my roof. Where
have you been retired? And what are these two lovely nymphs? Your
daughters? No, sure it can't be and you all youth and beauty
yourself. Present them."</p>
<p>And while mama blushed and bridled, the magic words were spoke,
and the two dropped the gentlest curtseys, and rising, received a
salute more than usual warm from his Excellency on either fair
blushing cheek. 'Twas observed he lingered an instant on Maria's.
Viceroys, too, are human.</p>
<p>'Twas an instantaneous conquest&mdash;how could it be otherwise?
A moment later they were the centre of a competing crowd of
gentlemen, and glances of coldness and aversion raining on them
from ladies only a little less fair and now deserted. That his
Excellency was the first victim, none could doubt, for when he was
not in company with the beauties, he was discoursing of them to
others. True it is that he conducted the Dowager Rathconnel to the
supper-table, but equally true that he left the lady seated before
such dainties as ensure an old age of gout, disengaging himself
with a nimble wit that should have appeased her, and sought out the
mother of the Graces, devoting himself to memories of old times
with a gusto, while Maria and Elizabeth danced and smiled on their
adorers, blooming and beautiful.</p>
<p>"My dear Madam," says his Lordship, "how is it possible that you
have lived so retired for fifteen years? 'T was not justice to your
admirers&mdash; of whom I was ever one. How came it about?"</p>
<p>"Why, your Excellency," says the lady very serious, "'twas not
with my good-will. You know well that my late father's good heart
was his chief possession; and my husband&mdash;alas!"</p>
<p>Sure a pause and downcast eyes are more expressive than any
words. His Excellency shook his majestic peruke, and echoed the
lady.</p>
<p>"Alas! Cards, horses, the bottle&mdash;how many a wife and
mother hath had cause to curse that fatal trinity! And 'tis even
so, Madam?"</p>
<p>She applied George Anne's laced handkerchief to her eye, then
smiled faintly and seeing opportunity, seized it.</p>
<p>"I would not cloud this festive scene, your Excellency, yet why
should I reserve from a tried friend that I and my poor
daughters&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" cries his Lordship, very impatient.</p>
<p>"&mdash;Are here this night in borrowed dress," continues Mrs G.
solemnly, "and are indebted even for the shoes upon their feet to
the kindness of an actress, Mrs Bellamy."</p>
<p>"Good Ged!" says Lord Harrington, genuinely shocked, and the
more so that he had himself known Mrs. Bellamy some years since.
"Sure it can't be! I won't believe it. Indeed, we must discourse
further of this. Come hither!"</p>
<p>Profoundly interested, he led her to a withdrawing-room and
there they fell into so deep discussion that never had he been such
a negligent host. And when Mrs. Gunning left the withdrawing-room,
it was with an imperial head held high, and a flush in her cheek
which became her so well that the most prying female eye would not
give her a day over thirty.</p>
<p>His Excellency led out Maria to a minuet. Twice he took
Elizabeth down the country dances. The generous wines had warmed
his heart, the glow of beauty kindled it to flame, and it was plain
to be seen that his eyes were only for the fair Gunnings. The world
followed his example,&mdash;when does it otherwise?&mdash;and a
petal from Maria's rose, a look from the violet dark-lashed eyes of
Elizabeth, were the prizes of the night.</p>
<p>A party of noblemen escorted them to the doors on leaving, and
'twas with the utmost difficulty Mrs. Gunning persuaded them it was
unnecessary to ride in cavalcade about the coach to Britain Street.
When the ladies were gone, they returned to the Banqueting Hall to
toast "The Irish Beauties," and break their glasses in their honour
until the floor was strewn with broken crystal, and the celebrants
were most of them borne speechless to their beds. Indeed, a
challenge passed between my Lords Cappoquin and Tuam upon a dispute
as to which lady was the greater Venus.</p>
<p>Never was such a triumph! And Mrs Gunning, falling into George
Anne's arms in Britain Street, declared with tears of
joy:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You were right, entirely right, my dearest Madam. I am promised
a handsome pension on the Irish Establishment, and his Excellency
counsels me to transport my girls to London, where, he considers,
they may pretend to the highest matches, and promises introductions
worthy of them. And, O Madam, playing at faro in the cardroom, I
won a milleleva&mdash;no less!&mdash; Fifty guineas!&mdash;Lord!
was ever anyone so happy!"</p>
<p>Tears of sensibility stood in George Anne's eyes. She was one
who shared to the full the griefs or triumphs of her friends. She
wrung Mrs G.'s hand and embraced the fair conquerors, scorning to
mention the rent in Maria's muslin gown, and the stain of wine on
Elizabeth's satin. It was a generous heart, and had earned more
gratitude than she afterwards received from two, at least, of the
ladies.</p>
<p>'Twas amazing to Mrs Gunning and Maria now that ever they had
contemplated the stage&mdash;so very far below their pretensions;
and it took but a week to open the former lady's eyes to the little
cracks in George Anne's reputation. She saw plainly that such a
friendship could be no aid to their soaring aspirations; and indeed
her ambition had now spread its wings to some purpose. The Earl of
Harrington having advanced the first installment of her pension,
she immediately moved their lodging to the genteeler Mount Street,
and Britain Street was forgot, along with George Anne. Sure a
mother must be prudent! Elizabeth only forsook not her friend,
going to wait upon her and carrying with her many of the posies
left in daily homage to her sister and herself. She had little in
her power, for money was still none too plenty; but kindness and
gratitude smell sweeter even than roses, and these she carried in
handfuls straight from a grateful heart to George Anne.</p>
<p>It smoothed not her own path in Mount Street, for Mrs Gunning's
pride grew with what fed it, and though admiration was plenty,
offers were few. It might be that the enmity of the Dublin ladies
stood in their way, for certain it is that Mrs G. was never a
favourite. Where she judged well to flatter, she flattered too
openly; where she disliked and saw no gain, she insulted; and many
gentlemen would have retired from her acquaintance, but for Maria's
frolicsome gaiety and the sweetness of Elizabeth. It gained ground
about the city that there was much scheming in Mount Street with a
view to rich husbands, and it smirched the girls as well as their
mama, and put thorns in their way. It made the men bolder than they
should be, and the women cold.</p>
<p>Maria was the hardier and took it as a necessity of their
situation; but the milder Elizabeth wept often on George Anne's
kind bosom over the insults (as she took it) which Mrs Gunning
received with rapture, as hopeful signs of love. And, whatever the
actress's own case might be, 'tis certain she showed more delicacy
in dealing with the girl than did her lady mother.</p>
<p>Nor had she much comfort from Mr Harry's letters. His father
remained adamant; and though he writ, 'twas more carelessly, and a
rumour reached Dublin that coupled his name with the great fortune
Miss Hooker, and was generally took for truth. Mrs Gunning greeted
it with pleasure, regarding Mr Harry as a gone-by and much below
her hopes; but though Elizabeth's heart was not wounded, her pride
was pierced to the quick. It seemed that all the world conspired to
humiliate her, and she asked herself what was the use of beauty, if
it meant this and no more. She sighed and left his last letter
unanswered.</p>
<p>Miss Maria too had her troubles. My Lord Errington pursued her
with ardour, and his handsome rakish face and gallant impudence
drew the pretty moth towards the heat and flame of a dangerous
candle. Folly, no more, but his lady took her vengeance in scandals
that spread about the town, and a duel was fought that did Maria no
good and kept off worthier pretenders to her hand; and indeed it
was not a day too soon when the family packed up their belongings
and changed the air to London. The girls outshone all
others&mdash;true! but 'twas thought more in beauty than
discretion, for Elizabeth must needs sink with her family. The
world draws not nice distinctions.</p>
<p>But to say they were courted in London is to say little. They
broke triumphant upon the town, supported by letters from his
Excellency, and the town received them with frenzy, as it might the
great Italian singer or the new lions at the Tower, or what not.
Amongst the greatest, the Duke of Hamilton put himself at their
disposal, urged thereto by a particular letter from my Lord
Harrington and his own love of beauty. He dangled about them daily,
and it must be owned that from the first moment of meeting Mrs
Gunning fixed the eye of cupidity on his Grace. For of all the
matches of the Kingdom James Hamilton was the greatest available.
Duke of Brandon in England, of Chatelherault in France, of Hamilton
in Scotland, of vast possessions, of suitable age and gallant
presence, a princess need not have disdained his hand. A great
prince, indeed, and knowing it possibly too well,'t was he to
dazzle a girl's eye and carry her heart by storm! For
hearts&mdash;it was never supposed his Grace possessed one; at
least, he wore it not on his sleeve, but was ever cold and haughty,
though it was well known he liked a pretty woman as well as
any&mdash;short of the wedding ring. He hung about the new beauties
as a gentleman will, until wagers began to be laid at White's as to
which had caught his favour, and where would fall the handkerchief
of the Grand Bashaw.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his attentions made them more than ever the mode, and
the town gallants swarmed about them like bees, at the Assemblies
where they figured, attended by my Lord Duke in ribbon and star. As
the days went by, however, the anxious mother observed that his
preference was for Elizabeth, and that he had no thought to
interfere with my Lord Coventry, who could not keep his eyes off
Maria, though he committed himself no further than the Duke.
Indeed, stories were now freely circulated concerning Britain
Street and the poverty and shifts of the family, and wagers were
laid that neither the one nobleman nor the other looked for more
than a few months' amusement with the two loveliest girls in
England. Mrs. Gunning was openly called the Adventuress, and it was
a favourite sport with some ladies to imitate her Irish accent and
carnying ways with those she would please; and doubtless Maria
angled a little too openly for her lord. They were, in short, easy
game for the mockers, and Elizabeth shrunk daily more into the
shade. It appeared as if it would be the Dublin story over
again.</p>
<p>Mr. Harry came at once to their lodging on his return from
Yorkshire, and to be sure, had not a word to say of Miss Hooker. He
would have saluted Elizabeth, but she drew back with a curtsey, her
manner sweet and cold as an autumn dawn with a touch of winter in
the air. He found her changed, and no wonder, and said as much with
some anger.</p>
<p>"It should not surprise you, Harry," says she serenely. "I am
now eighteen, and have seen the world, as you have also. Our
betrothal was a child's game. I like you too well to be your ruin.
Marry Miss Hooker, of whom I hear. 'Tis your best way, and
obedience to parents a plain duty."</p>
<p>"You were not so wise in Dublin," replies Mr. Lepel, casting a
jealous eye on the fair monitress. If her looks had changed it was
to a more radiant sweetness, and there was that in the way her long
silken lashes lay on her fair cheek that dwarfed Miss Hooker's
fortune. He had better have kept his distance from the siren, he
thought with bitterness. But sure a little pleasant dallying could
hurt neither Miss Hooker nor his father&mdash;a summer pastime and
no more; and if the tales flying about town were but the half of
them true, he might hope for this, especially with the past
pleading for him in Elizabeth's tender heart. Sure there was a
softening in her glance. He pushed his chair somewhat nearer and
took her hand. She withdrew it, and removed her seat farther
away.</p>
<p>"Is my Elizabeth angry with her Harry," cries he with a fine
dramatic air.</p>
<p>"Does she forget those happy days when we were all to one
another? What is Miss Hooker or Miss Any-person to come between us?
What&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Your future wife, as I understand," says Elizabeth, perfectly
calm. "No, Mr Lepel&mdash;I know the world now, better than I could
wish" (she sighed), "and I desire not your attentions.
I&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Mr Lepel broke in, pale and furious.</p>
<p>"And is it thus you speak, you heartless jade? Clothes, jewels,
balls, 'tis these you value. Is there a woman alive that will not
sell her soul for the like? O God, why are fair faces made to
madden us? Now I have seen you once more, how can I return to that
flat-faced&mdash;"</p>
<p>She rose, with a wave of her hand that dismissed him; but he
ranted on in a towering passion of wrath and grief. It had all
burst up anew in his heart, in and for a moment. He believed
himself hardly used indeed.</p>
<p>"Could I bury my father and inherit his land, you would not use
me thus. It is all a cursed thirst for gold, and you are for sale
like an Eastern slave. Who is the highest bidder? But I know well.
What am I to compare with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"His Grace the Duke of Hamilton!" announces Mrs Abigail, very
demure in her pinners at the door; and in walks his Grace,
magnificent in manners and dress, and Mr Lepel's fury stopped on a
breath, though he could not regain countenance as readily as
Elizabeth. She rose to meet the visitor&mdash; a rose in June; and
he might take the blush of anger which was due to Mr Lepel for a
welcome to himself.</p>
<p>What could Mr Harry do but draw back, stammering and looking
foolish under the cold glance Duke Hamilton bestowed on him.
Prudence counselled, "Withdraw. What do you here?" Angry Love
retorted, "Here I stay. What! Shall I leave the field to a rival?"
And so, flung himself in a chair glaring defiance, Elizabeth
palpitating between the two. 'Twas not surprising that she drew
nearer to the Duke, as if for protection; that there was an
imploring softness in her face as she looked up to him; that she
saw him greater, handsomer, stronger than ever, beside this idle
and futile young man who had reviled her. The carelessness of his
glance at Mr Lepel seemed to fling his pretensions in the
mud&mdash;his haughty coolness to degrade the young man; and to
such thoughts women are responsive. If her heart was touched
before, the dart went deeper now She held her head higher,
deerlike, and wasted no words on the unwelcome guest.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen, seeing neither could outstay the other,
departed presently together, Mr Lepel saying with assumed lightness
as he bowed, hat in hand, at the door: "We had not the pleasure to
see Madame la mere, your Grace, and no doubt but she is slipped
away on some hunting errand. I wonder what new fox is broke cover.
Half the world bets on my Lord Coventry still!"</p>
<p>The Duke returned not his salute, and Lepel could not tell
whether or no his arrow had gone home through the armour of chilly
pride and silence. He himself strode angry and ashamed down the
street.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>That same evening a Council of Three was held in the lodging,
Mrs. Gunning with her mask of smiles laid by, Maria fretful,
Elizabeth grave and retired in her own thoughts. The ladies had but
the one bedroom, with a little closet for the youngest
adjoining.</p>
<p>"Girls," says Mrs Gunning, "'Tis time I spoke plain. This six
weeks in town hath reduced my purse till I am frighted to look in
it; and what have we to show? Young women with not half your looks
are married and settled since we came hither. We have had a vast
deal of froth and flutter, but nothing solid. Were it possible to
live on sweetmeats and dress in posies, we have a fine prospect,
but not else. I see nought before us but Britain Street&mdash;or
worse.", Maria shrugged her white shoulders.</p>
<p>"What more can we do, mama? Sir James Ramsden has offered
marriage, and Captain Golightly; and Mr. Lennox has asked
Elizabeth, and Mr. Lepel&mdash;" "What signifies all that?" cries
Mrs. Gunning. "Don't let them slip. They'll serve for the future
perhaps, if all fails. Elizabeth, I command you on your duty that
you please Mr. Lepel, though not more than sufficient to content
him. If we can't better him&mdash;But, Maria, what said my Lord
Coventry to you at Lady Lowther's ball? I saw him very
earnest."</p>
<p>"Nothing that mightn't be in the news-prints, mama. His breed of
black shorthorns filled his thought and tongue. I protest I loathed
the man's folly. 'Tis an insipid creature when all's said."</p>
<p>"No man with a coronet is insipid. He is grave and reserved, and
I would he had been Elizabeth's admirer rather than yours, for they
could have sat silent in a corner together. But what of the Duke,
child? My hopes are sadly sunk."</p>
<p>Elizabeth flamed in a blush, less beautiful than painful. A sore
heart was behind it. She replied not. Mrs. Gunning frowned.</p>
<p>"Well, girls, you're easy enough, but so am not I. Now therefore
listen while I speak my mind."</p>
<p>'Tis needless to be particular in recording the lady's speech,
which was much to the point in dealing with their needs and
stratagems. She spoke for many minutes and at the end tears of
shame and anger were in Maria's lovely eyes. If Elizabeth
wept,'twas behind a sheltering hand.</p>
<p>"What signifies grumbling?" finishes Mrs Gunning. "'Tis as plain
as the nose on your face. Elizabeth's is the best chance, and if
she makes her match my Lord Coventry will kiss your slipper, Maria.
The Duchess's sister can marry where she will."</p>
<p>'Twas vain to interrupt. Mrs Gunning sailed on, maternal,
imperative, and took no heed. It would be impertinence to intrude
on the talk that followed, and the plan laid for the entrapping of
his Grace, of whom it may be said that he could protect himself
against even the assaults of beauty better than Mrs Gunning
supposed. But Elizabeth, borne down by two to her one, fought a
losing game.</p>
<p>"I hate the man," she cried with spirit, and knew 'twas false as
she said it. "I'd sooner sweep a crossing&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mrs Gunning smiled contemptuous.</p>
<p>"Not you! You came pretty near it in Britain Street, and 'tis
known how you relished it. Beggars, my dear, can't be choosers. The
Duchess of Hamilton may have as much delicacy as she pleases. Miss
Elizabeth Gunning can't afford it. There's no more to be said."</p>
<p>Yet Elizabeth said it furiously, and in vain.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>A subdued light of wax candles&mdash;the most flattering light
in the world&mdash; made the parlour enchantment when his Grace
sauntered in one evening, later. Posies were in the bowpots, and a
delicate scent of violets in the air. On a table by the window lay
a magnificent chicken-skin fan sent by my Lord Coventry for Maria's
birthday: it was covered with rosy figures of Cupids swinging
garlands in blue air, the mother-of-pearl sticks latticed with
gold. It lay beside a lace handkerchief, as if a fair hand had
flung it careless down. A decanter of purple Burgundy, with two
glasses, was hard by, and a small painting of the lovely sisters
from the hand of Neroni, who had asked the favour to depict them as
wood-nymphs. They advanced, smiling and bearing a garland between
them down a forest glade, while two Cupids concealed behind a tree
aimed a dart at each fair breast.</p>
<p>The Duke contemplated this work of art, smiling at his own
thoughts, and not pleasantly. Presently the door opened and Mrs
Gunning and Maria entered, in hats and capes, followed by
Elizabeth, dead pale and in a <i>neglige</i> with blue
ribbons, her hair falling in long tresses to the knee, confined
only with a fillet of ribbon. She looked not even her eighteen
years in this dress, and had a most touching beauty. His Grace
kissed Mrs Gunning's hand, yet with the half-contemptuous air of
the great man. Some might resent such a kiss as an insult, but the
lady's armour was defensive as well as offensive. Says she,
curtseying:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I beg a thousand pardons, your Grace, but we are disturbed with
an unexpected call. 'Tis what we never imagined, but can't refuse.
Good Mrs Acton, a friend of our Dublin days, is took ill and hath
sent for us to Harbour Street. She is unattended in London; I know
your Grace's sensibility will excuse us."</p>
<p>"Why, Madam, friendship is so rare a virtue that 'tis worth
proclaiming at the Exchange. I will give myself the pleasure to
wait on you another evening."</p>
<p>His hat was beneath his arm; he picked up his clouded cane.</p>
<p>"I thank your Grace." Mrs Gunning's voice was stately. It
changed as she turned to Elizabeth. "And now, my flower, my dove,
repose yourself on the couch, and Mrs Abigail will bring you the
lavender drops, and let me find my treasure well and smiling on my
return."</p>
<p>"What? Does not Miss Elizabeth accompany her mama?" The tone was
alert.</p>
<p>"By no means, your Grace. She has ailed all day with her head,
and is not fit for a sick chamber. Farewell, child. I wait your
Grace."</p>
<p>He took Mrs Gunning's hand to conduct her to the coach; 'twas as
pretty a comedy as ever George Anne Bellamy played. He laughed
inwardly leading her to the door, and on the stairs discoursed
charmingly on the last masquerade at Vauxhall. Without the hall
door he paused.</p>
<p>"Is Miss Elizabeth Gunning too ailing, Madam, to receive a
friend for a few moments? Permit me to assist you."</p>
<p>And before the lady could reply, he bundled the two into the
coach, and was halfway up the steps ere Mrs Gunning could cry: "I
know not, your Grace. A moment perhaps&mdash;"</p>
<p>He bowed from the door.</p>
<p>"Be easy, Madam. I will myself administer the lavender drops if
needful."</p>
<p>It was impossible for the Duke to hasten himself, for this he
had never done within the memory of man; but 'twas scarce a minute
since he had left the room when he re-entered, half fearing
to find his pretty bird flown. Not so, however. She leaned against
the shutter, her eyes fixed on the evening sky. It seemed she had
forgot his Grace, for her expression was sorrowful and quiet,
unlike the female trifling he expected, and he heard a faint sigh.
She turned, startled.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, my Lord Duke. I think I can't stay. My
head&mdash;"</p>
<p>She would have glided to the door. 'Twas provocative, however
meant, and he put himself in her way. She tried the other side of
the table. He blocked that also, and was before her again. Finally
she ceased the attempt and stood with eyes cast down.</p>
<p>"Child, don't hasten. Give me a few minutes. I see you alone for
the first time and never so lovely as now. Is it your long hair, or
what is it? Sure the angels have locks like this."</p>
<p>He lifted a heavy tress as if marvelling. She snatched it from
him like an aggrieved queen; then, seeming to recollect herself,
stood silent again. 'Twas but a schoolgirl, with trembling lips and
veiling hair. He took her hand like a man accustomed to be obeyed,
as indeed he was.</p>
<p>"Child, your mama hath left you in my care, and you can't desire
I should relinquish the pleasure. Such an opportunity no gentleman
could resist. Be seated, Madam, and let us discourse."</p>
<p>'Twas all on one side, for she had not opened her lips. But she
obeyed him, and sat in the chair he handed her to, as passive as a
marble lady. He seemed at a loss to continue, and stood looking at
her where she drooped, then took a chair beside her.</p>
<p>"You are pleased to be less cordial than I have known you,
Madam. Is it whim or anger? I like a woman's pretty coquetries as
well as any man, but this silence&mdash;"</p>
<p>It still continued. She was snow and marble. Not a word. Only
the dark lashes like fans on her cheek. Not a gleam rewarded
him.</p>
<p>"A sullen beauty!" says his Grace languidly, "but yet a beauty
beyond all others. So here we sit!" He drew out his jewelled
timepiece.</p>
<p>"I give you a minute, Madam&mdash;nay, two. And if by then you
have not spoke, I will try if the warmth of a kiss on those sweet
lips won't thaw the ice.</p>
<p>I swear it!"</p>
<p>He laid the sparkling toy at her elbow on the table, and stared
in her face. 'T is certain his Grace had dined. He was not wont to
treat any woman thus unless where it was asked for. A minute went
by&mdash;the tick was audible, but she moved not. And now a slow
hot tear scorched its way down her cheek. If this followed mama's
instruction, it bettered it. The tune was scarce out when he
springs up and cries with triumph:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I was not mistook. Your silence asks a kiss, child, and James
Hamilton was never the man to refuse a woman's challenge. Give me
your lips, and more."</p>
<p>His swashbuckling Border ancestors were stirring in his veins,
and for a moment his face coarsened and his eyes were gross. He
caught her by the two arms and bent his mouth upon hers.</p>
<p>In a flash the fair statue was living and dangerous. He was a
strong man, she a wisp of a girl; but she flung him off and stood
glaring at him.</p>
<p>"How dare you?" she panted, and could no more. The eyes were
unveiled at last and rained fire on him. Never had any person seen
her look thus; she faced him gallantly. He applauded as if it had
been the Woffington or any other fair game.</p>
<p>"'Tis prettily done&mdash;but I see your drift, Madam. If a
young lady is left by her friends and her own desire to sit alone
with one of the best-known men in town, she takes the consequences.
Yet I would not have missed Lucretia&mdash;she lacked only the
dagger in her hand. But the comedy may end. Give me your lips,
child, and coquet no more."</p>
<p>"Sir&mdash;if you are a gentleman&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Madam, I am a lover."</p>
<p>"Oh,'tis too much&mdash;too much!" she cries. "I have undertook
what was beyond me, and I can't&mdash;I can't carry it through. I
would if I could&mdash;I cannot!"</p>
<p>The strange words, the despair in her face was no stage-play.
The Duke knew sincerity when it cried aloud. Still grasping her
hands, he stood at arm's length, staring in her face.</p>
<p>"You cannot, Madam? What mean you? Are you in earnest?"</p>
<p>Not withdrawing her hands, fast held and quivering, she kept
silence. He could feel the pulses flutter in her wrists, and the
fumes of wine cleared slowly out of his brain and carried the
brutality with them.</p>
<p>"Have the condescension to explain yourself. You are safe in my
company now. Possibly I was mistook, but I supposed you not
unwilling for our tete-a-tete. Accept my
apologies if this is not the case. I thrust no attentions on women
who dislike them."</p>
<p>"Sir, I will explain, and go, and never see your face again. I
die of shame."</p>
<p>He could still feel the pitiful flutter in her wrists. He
relaxed his grip and handed her to her chair,&mdash;a gentleman
again,&mdash;James, Duke of Hamilton and Brandon. "I see myself
gravely in error, Madam. I await your words."</p>
<p>She would not sit, nor he. They stood apart now, and he could
scarce hear the silver tremble of her voice.</p>
<p>"Sir, we are poor. You know this. And last night my mother did
ask me whether I supposed your Grace had any feeling for me beyond
careless goodwill. I knew not. What could I say? And she then
revealed to me&mdash;oh, how reveal it now!&mdash;that our little
means is all but spent, and that gone, we must retire into poverty
and misery again. Also that there are debts, and prison for
debtors. Also that any match for my sister is impossible to hope
for&mdash;No&mdash;how can I tell it! And she did say that if we
could hope&mdash; could but know that&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her voice died on her lips. She hung her head in agony. He took
her up.</p>
<p>"The task is too hard for you. Let me continue. Your mama said
that, if she and your sister withdrew and left you with me, if you
put forth your charms (and God knows there were never such!), 'twas
possible you might set the sweetest trap for the rich man, and with
his aid clamber out of the mud and sit secure beside him. Confirm
me if I don't err. Confess!"</p>
<p>"I confess." The words scarce broke the silence.</p>
<p>"And love was not in the bargain," the cruel voice persisted.
"Mama did not enquire whether James Hamilton was distasteful to you
or the reverse. He was a moneybag&mdash;no man. Confess again."</p>
<p>"I confess. Sir, we have used you very ill. I ask your pardon. I
was a fair mark for insult." Her head dropped lower. She could not
otherwise hide her face, but shame overflowed it in waves of
crimson.</p>
<p>"To be frank, Madam, I have never found your mother congenial
company.</p>
<p>'Twas not for her I sought this house. Tell me, was this her
plot only?</p>
<p>Was it acceptable to you?"</p>
<p>"At least, I followed it. She is my mother. I am one flesh and
blood with her. If she is a plotter, so too am I. I bid your Grace
farewell, and pray for so much pity as that you will never come
this way again, nor see me, lest I die at your feet."</p>
<p>"Madam, do I owe you no apology?"</p>
<p>"I think none, your Grace. You acted as the woman you took me
for might, I suppose, expect. Let me go."</p>
<p>A singular thing happened here. The Duke, the haughtiest and
coldest of men, bent his knee and carried her hand to his lips. So
on Birthnights he kissed the late Queen's hand, she standing before
the Throne. Then stood very grave. "Madam, I entreat your pardon. I
have shown you a side of a man's character very unfitting for your
eyes and you but the child you are. Forgive me, and ere we part for
ever, answer me one question, in token of your pardon. Had I been
but James Hamilton, the lowest of my clan&mdash;could you have
honoured me with any regard?"</p>
<p>She stammered, trembling before this melancholy gentleness.</p>
<p>"I know not."</p>
<p>He persisted, gentle but firm:</p>
<p>"We have perhaps something to pardon each other. I ask
again&mdash;would this have been possible?"</p>
<p>Constrained, she sought for breath. Because a cold handsome face
softens, because distrust is melted, shall a woman let her heart
fly like a bird to a man's bosom?</p>
<p>"Sir, you ask more than I can answer."</p>
<p>Still the eyes insisted, and now the strong hand held hers.</p>
<p>"Sir&mdash;I think&mdash;I believe&mdash;it had not been
impossible."</p>
<p>"What&mdash;not James Hamilton&mdash;no more?&mdash;with a
shieling on the moors, and the heather-cock for food, and a
Hamilton plaid to wrap his heart's darling, and a fire of peats to
sit by, and this hand empty but for love and his
claymore?&mdash;Would the beauty of the world have come to his
breast?"</p>
<p>His voice was a strong music&mdash;a river in spate. His eyes
caught hers and held them.</p>
<p>"'Tis not impossible. But oh, how should I prove it&mdash;prove
it? There's not a word I say but rings false now. Leave
me&mdash;leave me. I have said too much."</p>
<p>"You can't prove it? But you can, and if you prove it, I will
distrust God's mercy before I will distrust my girl. All you have
told me was known to me&mdash;known to all the town. It rings
through the streets that the fair Gunnings and their mother are
schemers; that they love none and seek only the best price for
their charms. Marry me now, this hour, Elizabeth, and face the
world that will call you plotter and adventuress. For they will so!
There's no club in town but will ring with the story of how the
beauty was cunningly left to a half-drunk man's advances. That's
how Horry Walpole and all the old women of both sexes will have it!
All this will be known through your mother's folly and your
Abigail's chatter, and they will tell how you trapped me, how I
would have escaped and could not for the snares about my feet.
Marry me and face this, if you will, and I will believe you love
me, for you will stand a disgraced woman for all time. Marry me
not, and I will make your way easy with gold, and your mother shall
tell her own tale, and not a smirch on your name and fear not but
another rich man will give you all I could, and not a spot on it.
Choose now once and for all. I have seen and I know how my coronet
will sting you with shame&mdash;with shame set in it."</p>
<p>He did not embrace her. 'Twas the strangest wooing. The clock
pointed to eleven. The house was dead silent. Her eyes widened with
pain and fear. She looked piteously at him.</p>
<p>"They will say you caught me drunk, whom you could not catch
sober. They will say you forced the marriage, lest I escape. There
is nothing they will not say but the truth&mdash;that my sweetheart
is the sweetest, the purest, the proudest woman alive. Your
delicacy will be trod in the mud, Madam. Will you take your man at
that? Will you crawl through the dirt to his heart?"</p>
<p>His fire kindled hers. Her eyes glittered.</p>
<p>"And if they believed me worthless&mdash;that is not what I ask.
What would your Grace think?"</p>
<p>He smiled with peculiar sweetness.</p>
<p>"Child, you know. Look at me."</p>
<p>And still she trembled.</p>
<p>"Beloved, adored!" he cried. "Think you I knew not 'twas death
to you to tell the truth? Shall a man find a pearl in the dirt and
not set it over his heart. I have loved you since first I saw your
fair face, and now I honour you. Come to me and bless me; and when
these fools cackle and gibber, I shall know how to protect my
wife."</p>
<p>His arms went round her.</p>
<p>"I will do it," she said.</p>
<p>The minutes passed in an exquisite joy, plucked out of shame
like a rose from a torrent. He left her and went to the door, and
leaning over the balustrade, called down the stair:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Armitage!"</p>
<p>A young man, handsomely dressed and something of a fop after his
valet-fashion, sprang up the stair&mdash;his Grace's gentleman. His
master, very tranquil and haughty, was by the door&mdash;the fair
Miss Gunning erect in her chair.</p>
<p>"Armitage, proceed at once to my house, and acquaint my
chaplain, Mr MacDonald, that this lady and I are to be married
immediately. Desire him to come hither with all that is necessary,
and lose not a moment."</p>
<p>And seeing Armitage hesitate like a man wonderstruck, the Duke
stamped his foot and set him flying down the way he came, calling
after him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Desire Mrs Abigail to come up this moment."</p>
<p>They heard the door shut violently, and Mrs Abigail came up,
very demure and curtseying to the ground.</p>
<p>"Be seated, good woman. Your lady will excuse you. We wait the
Reverend Mr MacDonald, with ring and licence, and you and Armitage
shall serve for witnesses to the marriage. Now I think of it, call
also the woman of the house."</p>
<p>He carried it masterfully, and Elizabeth, no more than any other
woman, could be insensible to that charming tyranny. He stood
behind her chair while the woman called for Mrs Mann&mdash;who
came, mortally afraid of her company.</p>
<p>"Shall Mrs Abigail braid my hair?&mdash;it tumbles all about
me," says Elizabeth, questioning her master timidly.</p>
<p>"'Tis so great a beauty I will not have it hid," he cries,
standing behind her chair where the long locks lay on the
ground.</p>
<p>Silence again, and the time passing.</p>
<p>At last, a sound as if Armitage propelled somewhat before him up
the stair, and into the room walks his Grace's gentleman, and
before him a stout personage in bands and cassock, so breathless
from haste as to be incapable of any speech.</p>
<p>"Hath he the licence?"</p>
<p>"He hath, your Grace, but he declares that the occasion being so
great, and the incumbent of Mayfair Chapel, Dr Keith, being at home
and the chapel open, for the greater solemnity 'twere well to have
the marriage solemnised there. 'Tis but ten minutes, and I have
brought the chariot, if it please your Grace."</p>
<p>And now, puffing sore, the clergyman put in his plea,&mdash;not
for delay, the Duke's face forbade that,&mdash;but that all be done
with ceremony.</p>
<p>"If a word more be said, I send for the Archbishop!" swears his
Grace, flushed and handsome. "My chariot's at the door. Bundle in
all who can. Madam, allow me."</p>
<p>He drew the bride's hand to his, and preceded them down the
stair, holding it high as in a minuet. The women followed without a
word. Elizabeth went in a dream, half-enchantment,
half-nightmare.</p>
<p>The chapel was dark and musty&mdash;no time to light the lamps;
but Mr Armitage, the facile, the adroit, a perfect Mercury and old
in experience, called in four linkmen waiting by their ladies'
empty chairs in the street outside.</p>
<p>These grimy fellows stood upon the altar steps, two at a side,
lighting the book the parson opened, his voice resounding through
the silent place with startling loudness. Behind the bridal pair
huddled the women.</p>
<p>"Dearly Beloved, we are met together&mdash;" and so to the
close. But his voice was muffled beside the clear ring of James
Hamilton's. His "I will" fell like a sword on the air. He was never
a man to show his heart but to the one in whose hand it lay, and
his tone disdained all but the woman who stood by him. He put his
signet ring on her finger, and they turned from the altar man and
wife.</p>
<p>"Give each of these men five guineas, and bid them light her
Grace to her chariot, Armitage. Take you the women back to Mrs
Gunning's lodging, where we follow. I thank you, Mr Keith, for the
best service any man ever did me. It shall not go unrewarded."</p>
<p>He handed her into the chariot with the utmost ceremony; and
when the door was closed, flung himself on his knees before her,
clasping her waist.</p>
<p>"My dear&mdash;my girl, how shall I thank you? Think you I don't
know what it hath cost you&mdash;and the proof you have given me
that your heart is mine. My wife&mdash;my sweetheart!"</p>
<p>'Twas half after twelve when Mrs Gunning returned with Maria,
being a prudent woman, and resolved that, if the criminal did not
hang himself, it should not be for want of rope.</p>
<p>"The chariot's at the door and the light still in the parlour!"
she whispered; "sure, he can't be there still? Heaven send he be
not drunk and asleep. 'Twas mere folly to leave the wine!"</p>
<p>Not a sound. They approached as it were on tiptoe up the stair,
and softly opened the door.</p>
<p>My Lord Duke, attended by Armitage, stood before them, splendid
in his dark red velvet laced with silver, the blue ribbon crossing
his breast. He held Elizabeth by the hand, she pale as ashes but
perfectly composed.</p>
<p>Mrs Gunning gave a fine dramatic start, Maria advancing behind
her, devoured with curiosity.</p>
<p>"What&mdash;what can this mean? Little did I expect to find your
Grace here at this hour. Elizabeth, I fear you have been vastly
imprudent. Your good name&mdash;" She might have said more but the
Duke came forward, very magnificent.</p>
<p>"Madam, permit me to introduce a <i>stranger</i>," says he, with
emphasis on the word, "Her Grace the Duchess of Hamilton."</p>
<p>"Lord! Then 'tis to be!" cries Mrs Gunning, all radiant, and
mistaking his meaning. "O my sweet child, my Elizabeth&mdash;how
have you took me by surprise! When shall it be, your Grace?"</p>
<p>"Madam, it is done. Miss Gunning became my bride in the Mayfair
Chapel&mdash; was it twenty minutes since, Armitage?"</p>
<p>"Fifteen, your Grace."</p>
<p>"'Twas all in order&mdash;a clergyman?&mdash;'twas legal?" pants
Mrs Gunning, her hand to her heart.</p>
<p>"Assuage your maternal fears, Madam." His lip was
disdainful&mdash;he set her a world away. "All was as you could
have wished. Permit the Duchess and myself to wish you farewell and
good night&mdash;or rather good morning."</p>
<p>He led Elizabeth to the door, which Armitage held open. It
closed behind them, and their steps were heard descending. The
Duchess had not said a word.</p>
<p>There was silence until the chariot had rumbled away, when Mrs
Gunning found her voice.</p>
<p>"I did not credit her with such skill. She hath played her cards
well indeed. I would give the world to know what passed."</p>
<p>"That we shall never know," says Maria. "He's not the man to
tell his secrets, nor she neither. Sure, they're a pair."</p>
<p>"Well, Heaven send you show the like skill with my Lord
Coventry. You can't do better. Lord, how my heart beats for
joy!"</p>
<p>"I shall not need, Madam," says Miss Maria coolly. "She has
ensured my match with her own. The Duchess of Hamilton's sister
won't go begging for a husband. 'Tis now but to choose my wedding
silk. Come, let us to bed. These late hours hurt my bloom. Let us
however drink a toast in this wine to old Mother Corrigan and the
Golden Vanity. 'Tis the least we can do. Blow out the candles."</p>
<p>(<i>Elizabeth, later Duchess of Argyll, bore her honours with
dignity and became a very great lady. Maria, Countess of Coventry,
died aged twenty-seven, not untouched by scandal, and a victim to
her own frivolity. Mrs Gunning received a valuable appointment as
Housekeeper at one of the royal palaces. "The Luck of the Gunnings"
became a proverb.</i></p>
<p><i>It has been disputed which of the two famous actresses, Peg
Woffington or George Anne Bellamy had the honour of setting the

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>V. THE WALPOLE BEAUTY</h2>
<h4>Maria Walpole<br>
<i>Countess of Waldegrave<br>
Duchess of Gloucester</i><br>
17(?)-1807</h4>
<p>Horace Walpole was convinced that even the Gunnings envied the
beauty of Maria Walpole, his niece. "Yesterday," he writes,
"t'other famous Gunning dined there. She has made a friendship with
my charming niece, to disguise her jealousy." To the surprise of
all London, Maria, daughter of Sir Edward Walpole and Maria
Clements, married the Earl of Waldegrave, "for character and credit
the first match in England." At her husband's death, she refused
the Duke of Portland, but secretly married the Duke of Gloucester,
brother to the King. Her admirers point out the romance of her
fortunes&mdash;how she was daughter of a milliner, granddaughter of
a great Prime Minister, widow of an Earl, wife of a Duke,
sister-in-law to the King, mother of the three ladies Waldegrave,
and, in her second marriage, mother of Prince William and the
Princess Sophia.</p>
<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds made seven portraits of the lovely "Walpole
Beauty." Years afterward, when he was at work on his famous
painting of her three daughters, Walpole begged him to pose them
"as the three Graces, adorning a bust of the Duchess as the Magna
Mater." "But," adds the veteran of Strawberry Hill, with what
resignation he can muster, "my ideas were not adopted."</p>

<b><i>Maria Walpole, Countess of Waldegrave and her daughter
Elizabeth Laura afterwards Countess of Waldegrave.</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p>[<i>From a packet of letters, written in the middle of the
eighteenth century by Lady Fanny Armine to her cousin, Lady
Desmond, in Ireland, I have strung together one of the strangest of
true stories&mdash;the history of Maria Walpole, niece of the
famous Horace Walpole and illegitimate daughter of his brother, Sir
Edward Walpole. The letters are a potpourri of town and family
gossip, and in gathering the references to Maria Walpole into
coherence, I am compelled to omit much that is characteristic and
interesting.</i>]</p>
<p><i>May, 1754.</i></p>
<p>Why, Kitty, my dear, what signifies your reproaches? I wish I
may never be more guilty than I am this day. I laid out a part of
your money in a made-up mantua and a petticoat of Rat de St. Maur,
and for the hat,'twas the exact copy of the lovely
Gunning's&mdash;Maria Coventry. And though I won't flatter you,
child, by saying your bloom equals hers (for I can't tell what hers
may be under the white lead she lays on so thick), yet I will say
that your Irish eyes may ambuscade to the full as well beneath it,
though they won't shoot an earl flying, like hers, because you have
captured your baronet already!</p>
<p>But 'tis news you would have&mdash;news, says you, of all the
gay doings of the town.</p>
<p>And how is her Gunning Grace of Hamilton, you ask, and do the
folk still climb on chairs at Court to stare at her? Vastly in
beauty, child. She was in a suit of fine blue satin at the last
Birthnight, sprigged all over with white, and the petticoat robings
broidered in the manner of a trimming wove in the satin. A hoop of
the richest damask, trimmed with gold and silver. These cost
fourteen guineas a hoop, my dear. Who shall say the ladies of the
present age don't understand refinements? Her Grace had diamonds
plastered on wherever they would stick, and all the people of
quality run mad to have a stare at so much beauty, set off with as
much glare as Vauxhall on a fete night, and she as demure
as a cat after chickens.</p>
<p>But 'tis always the way with these sudden-come-ups, they never
have the easy carriage that comes from breeding, and 'tis too much
to expect she should be a topping courtier.</p>
<p>You must know Horry Walpole was there, in gray and silver
brocade, as fine and finical a gentleman as ever, and most
genteelly lean; and says I to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What think you, Mr Walpole, of our two coquet Irish beauties?
Do they put out all the fire of our English charmers?"</p>
<p>So he drew himself up and took a pinch of rappee (can't you see
him, Kitty, my girl?), and says he:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Madam, to a lady that is herself all beauty and need envy none,
I may say we have a beauty to be produced shortly to the town that
will flutter all the world, excepting only the lady I have the
honour to address."</p>
<p>And, Lord! the bow he made me, with his hat to his heart!</p>
<p>"La, man," says I, "who is she? But sure I know. 'T is the
Duchess of Queensberry reduced a good half in size and with a new
complexion."</p>
<p>But Horry shook his ambrosial curls.</p>
<p>"No, Madam, 'pon honour! A little girl with the vivacity of
sixteen and brown eyes, brown hair&mdash;in fact, a brown
beauty."</p>
<p>And then it flashed on me and I says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Good God!&mdash;Maria! But sure she can't be presented. 'Tis
impossible!" And could have bit my silly tongue out when't was
said.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders like a Frenchman,&mdash;'tis the last
grace he picked up in Paris,&mdash;and turned from me to the new
lady errant, Miss Chester, who models herself on the famous Miss
Chudleigh.</p>
<p>But nothing could equal the horrid indecency of Miss Chudleigh's
habit at the Ranelagh Masquerade some five years back, when Mrs
Montagu, observing her, said: "Here is Iphigenia for the sacrifice,
but so naked the high priest may inspect the entrails of the victim
without more ado." And says Horry: "Surely, 'tis Andromeda she
means herself, and not Iphigenia!" I thought we should have died
laughing. The Maids of Honour were then so offended not one of 'em
would speak to her. They are not such prudes today, and Miss
Chester has as much countenance as she looks for. Alas, it takes a
wise woman, if not a good one, to know just where certainty should
stop and imagination take its place!</p>
<p>But, Kitty child, who do you guess is the new beauty? I give you
one, I give you two, I give you three! And if 'twas three hundred,
you'd be never the wiser. Why, Maria Walpole, you little blockhead!
Maria, the daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, Horry's brother. What
think you of that? But Sir Edward never was married, says you. True
for you, Kitty, but don't you know the story? No, to be sure.
There's no scandal in Ireland, for St. Patrick banished it along
with the snakes and their poison, because the island that has so
many misfortunes would have died of another.</p>
<p>Well, take your sampler like a good little girl and hearken to
the history of the lovely Maria that's to blow out the Gunning
candles. Let me present to your la'ship Sir Edward Walpole, brother
to the Baron of Strawberry Hill. A flourish and a sliding bow, and
you know one another! Sir Edward, who resembles not Horry in his
love for the twittle-twattle of the town, is a passable performer
on the bass viol, and a hermit&mdash;the Hermit of Pall Mall. But
the rules of that Hermitage are not too severe, child. 'Tis known
there were relaxations. And notably one.</p>
<p>The Hermit some years since was lodged in Pall Mall; and in the
lower floors was lodged a dealer in clothes, with prentices to
fetch and carry.</p>
<p>Lord! says Kitty, what's this to the purpose? Attend, Madam. The
curtain rises!</p>
<p>'Tis an old story: the virtuous prentice&mdash;and the
unvirtuous. There was one of them&mdash;Dorothy Clement, a rustic
beauty, straw hat tied under the roguish chin, little tucked-up
gown of flowered stuff, handkerchief crossed over the bosom,
ruffled elbows. 'Tis so pretty a dress, that I protest I marvel
women of quality don't use it! However, this demure damsel looked
up at Sir Edward under the hat, and he peeped under the brim, and
when he left the house and returned to his own, what should happen
but the trembling beauty runs to him, one fine day, for protection,
swearing her family and master have all cast her off because 'twas
noted the gentleman had an eye for a charming face.</p>
<p>Well, child, 'tis known hermits do not marry. 'Tis too much to
ask of their Holinesses. But he set a chair at the foot of his
table for the damsel, and bid her share his pulse and crusts; and
so 'twas done, and whether in town or country, the Hermitess kept
him company till she died. Sure the Walpoles are not too fastidious
in their women, excepting only Horry of Strawberry Hill, who has
all the finicals of the others rolled up in his lean body.</p>
<p>Well, Kitty, there were four children: a boy,&mdash;nothing to
the purpose,&mdash; and Laura, Maria, and Charlotte. And the poor
lasses, not having a rag of legitimacy to cover 'em, must needs
fall back on good behaviour and good looks. I saw Laura, a pretty
girl, in the garden at Englefield some years since, when I was
airing in Lady Pomfret's coach; and as we looked, the little hoyden
Maria comes running up in muslin and blue ribbons, all health and
youth and blooming cheeks and brown curls and eyes&mdash;a perfect
Hebe. And 'tis she&mdash;the milliner's brat&mdash;that's to borrow
the Car of Love and set the world afire. But she can't be
presented, Kitty; for our high and mighty Royals frown on vice, and
not a single creature with the bar sinister can creep into Court,
however many may creep out. And that's that!</p>
<p>And now I end with compliments and curtseys to your la'ship, and
the glad tidings that one of the virgin choir of Twickenham, those
Muses to which Mr Horace Walpole is Apollo, has writ an Ode so full
of purling streams and warbling birds, that Apollo says he will
provide a sidesaddle for Pegasus, and no male shall ever bestride
him again.</p>
<p><i>September, 1758.</i></p>
<p>O la, la, la! Was you ever at the Bath, child? Here am I just
returned, where was great company, and all the wits and belles, and
Miss Biddy Green, the great city fortune, run off with Harry Howe,
and her father flourishing his gouty stick in the Pump Room and
swearing a wicked aristocracy should have none of his honest
guineas. But he'll soften when he sees her presented at Court, with
feathers stuck in her poll and all the city dames green with spite.
'Tis the way of the world.</p>
<p>But to business. The town is talking with hundred-woman noise on
the marriage that Laura,&mdash;by courtesy called
Walpole,&mdash;the Hermit's eldest daughter, makes tomorrow. 'Twill
astound you, Lady Desmond your Honour, as much as it did your
humble servant. For Miss Laura honours the Church, no less, with
her illegitimate hand, and no less a dignitary than a Canon of
Windsor! Is not this to be a receiver of stolen goods? Does not his
Reverence compound a felony in taking such a bride? What say you?
'Tis Canon Keppel, brother to Lord Albemarle; and mark you,
Kitty&mdash;the Honourable Mrs Keppel has the right to be presented
where Miss Laura might knock at the door in vain! We come up in the
world, child; but the Walpoles had always that secret.</p>
<p>'Twill set the other charming daughters dreaming of bride-cake.
All the world talks of Maria, a shining beauty indeed. Horry
Walpole is enchanted at Miss Laura's match&mdash;sure, an
illegitimate Walpole, if niece to the Baron of Strawberry, is worth
a dozen of your Cavendishes and Somersets! I laughed like a rogue
in my sleeve when says Horry to me at my drum:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Colonel Yorke is to be married to one or both of the Miss
Crasteyns, great city fortunes&mdash;nieces to the rich grocer.
They have two hundred and sixty thousand pounds apiece. Nothing
comes amiss to the digestion of that family&mdash;a marchioness or
a grocer."</p>
<p>Says I, flirting my fan:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Tis gross feeding, sure, Mr Walpole. Now, had it been a royal
illegitimate."</p>
<p>He looked daggers, and took a pinch of snuff with an air. Never
was a man with more family pride, though he affects to scorn
it.</p>
<p>What think you of this latest news of Lady Coventry? The people
are not yet weary of gazing upon the Gunnings, and stared somewhat
upon her last Sunday was se'night in the Park. Would you believe
it, Kitty, that she complained to the King, and His Majesty, not to
be outdone in wisdom, offers a guard for her ladyship's beauty. On
this she ventures into the Park, and, pretending fright, desires
the assistance of the officer, who orders twelve sergeants to march
abreast before her and a sergeant and twelve men behind her; and in
this pomp did the silly little fool walk all the evening, with more
mob about her than ever, her blockhead husband on one side and my
Lord Pembroke on the other! I'm sure I can't tell you anything to
better this, so good night, dear cousin, with all affectionate
esteem.</p>
<p><i>April</i>, 1769.</p>
<p>Great news, your la'ship. I am but just returned from a royal
progress to visit the Baron of Strawberry Hill. Strawberry was in
prodigious beauty&mdash; spring flowers, cascades, grottoes, all
displayed to advantage in a sunshine that equalled June. The
company, her Gunning Grace of Hamilton, the Duchess of Richmond,
Lady Aylesbury, and your humble servant.</p>
<p>Says Mr Horace, leaning on his amber-top cane and surveying us,
as the three sat in the shell on the terrace and I stood
by:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Strawberry Hill is grown a perfect Paphos. 'Tis the land of
beauties, and if Paris himself stood where I do, he could never
adjudge the golden apple."</p>
<p>He writ the same to George Montagu after, who showed the letter
about town:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There never was so pretty a sight as to see the three sitting.
A thousand years hence, when I begin to grow old, if that can ever
be, I shall talk of that event and tell the young people how much
handsomer the women of my time were than they are now."</p>
<p>There's a compliment like a fresh-plucked rose from the Lord of
Strawberry. It reads pretty, don't it, child? Horry was in vast
wit&mdash;'twas like the Northern Lights hurtling about
us&mdash;made us blink! The Duchess of Richmond pretending she
could not recall her marriage-day, says Horry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Record it thus, Madam. This day thousand years I was
married!"</p>
<p>'Twas not till a week later I discovered this to be a bon mot of
Madame de Sevigne. His jewels are polished very fine, but 'tis not
always in the Strawberry mine they are dug. But to our
news&mdash;What will your Honour pay me for a penn'orth?</p>
<p>Tis of our beauty, Maria&mdash;ahem!&mdash;Walpole. The pretty
angler has caught her fish&mdash;a big fish, a gold fish, even a
golden-hearted fish, for't is Lord Waldegrave! A belted earl, a
Knight of the Garter, no less, for the pretty milliner's daughter.
You don't believe it, Kitty? Yet you must, for't is true, and sure.
If beauty can shed a lustre over puddled blood, she has it. Lord
Villiers, chief of the macaronis, said, yesterday was a
week:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Of all the beauties Miss Walpole reigns supreme&mdash;if one
could forget the little accident of birth! Her face, bloom, eyes,
teeth, hair, and person are all perfection's self, and Nature broke
the mould when she made this paragon, for I know none like
her."</p>
<p>'Tis true, but 'tis so awkward with these folk that can't be
presented nor can't meet this one nor that. Still, I have had her
much to my routs and drums, where 'tis such an olla podrida that it
matters not who comes. But Lady Waldegrave may go where she will;
and certainly the bridegroom has nothing to object on the score of
birth, for he comes from James the Second by the left hand, and for
aught I know a left-hand milliner is as good these Republican days.
Anyhow, 'tis so, and Horry, who would have all think him above such
thoughts, is most demurely conceited that a Walpole&mdash;
ahem!&mdash;should grace the British peerage. Remains now only
Charlotte, and I dare swear she will carry her charms to no worse
market than Maria, though not so great a Venus.</p>
<p>I went yesterday evening to the Bluestocking Circle at Mrs
Montagu's fine house in Hill Street. I am not become learned,
Kitty, but 'twas to hear the lionesses roar, and because I knew the
Lord of Strawberry would be there and was wishful to hear his
exultations. Lord preserve us, child, what a frightening place! We
were ushered into the Chinese Room, lined with painted Pekin paper,
and noble Chinese vases, and there were all the lions, male and
female, in a circle&mdash;the Circle of the Universe. All the great
ladies of the Bluestocking Court were there: the vastly learned Mrs
Carter, Mrs Delany over from Ireland, the Swan of Lichfield Miss
Anna Seward, Mrs Chapone, and other lionesses and <i>cubesses</i>.
My dear, they sat in a half-moon, and behind them another half-moon
of grave ecclesiastics and savants, and Horry at the head of them,
in brown and gold brocade. 'Twas not sprightly, Kitty. 'Tis true
these women are good and learned, and some of them well enough in
looks; but 'tis so pretentious, so serious,&mdash;I lack a
word!&mdash;so censorious of all that does not pull a long face,
that, when Mrs Montagu rose to meet us with the shade of
Shakespeare in attendance (for no lower footman would serve so
majestic a lady), I had a desire to seize her two hands and gallop
round the room with her, that I could scarce restrain. But sure she
and the company had died of it!</p>
<p>I expected great information from such an assemblage, but 'twas
but a snip-snap of talk&mdash;remarks passed from one to another,
but served as it were on massy plate&mdash;long words, and too many
of 'em. Dull, my dear, dull! And so 'twill always be when people
aim to be clever. They do these things better in France, where they
have no fear of laughter and the women sparkle without a visible
machinery. 'Twas all standing on the mind's tip-toe here. And when
the refreshments were served I made for Horry&mdash;</p>
<pre>
On silver vases loaded rise
The biscuits' ample sacrifice,
And incense pure of fragrant tea.
</pre>
<p>But Bluestockingism is nourished on tea as wit on wine. "So, Mr
Walpole," says I, "what is this news I hear of Miss Maria? My
felicitations to the bridegroom on the possession of so many
charms."</p>
<p>And Horry with his bow:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I thank your ladyship's partiality and good heart. For
character and credit, Lord Waldegrave is the first match in
England, and for beauty, Maria&mdash;excepting only the lady I
address. The family is well pleased, though 'tis no more than her
deserts, and 'twas to be expected my father's grandchild would ally
herself with credit."</p>
<p>'Tis when Horry Walpole gives himself these demure airs that I
am tempted to be wicked, Kitty. For what signifies talking? The
girl is a beauty, but Nancy Parsons and Kitty Fisher are beauties,
too, and if the court and peerage are opened to women of no birth,
why what's left for women of quality? 'Tis certain the next
generation of the peerage bids fair to be extreme ill-born, and the
result may be surprising. But I held my tongue, for I have a
kindness for Horry and his niece, though I laugh at 'em.</p>
<p>I thought Mr Walpole looked ill, and doubted whether I might
hope to see him at my Tuesday rout. Says he:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Tis the gout, Madam, that ungallant disorder, and had I a mind
to brag, I could boast of a little rheumatism too; but I scorn to
set value on such trifles, and since your ladyship does me the
honour to bespeak my company, I will come if 'twere in my coffin
and pain. May I hope your ladyship will favour us at Maria's
nuptials? Sure the Graces were ever attended by Venus on occasions
of ceremony."</p>
<p>He would have said more, but the Queen of the Blues swam up,
protesting and vowing she had never seen such a goddess as Miss
Maria Walpole; that were she to marry the Emperor of the world,
'twould be vastly below the merit of such glowing charms. And so
forth.</p>
<p>'Tis a lady that paints all her roses red and plasters her
lilies white, and whether 'tis malice, I can't tell, but believe
'tis possible to blast by praise as well as censure, by setting the
good sense of one half the world and the envy of the other against
the victim. So she shrugged and simpered and worked every muscle of
her face, in hopes to be bid to the wedding; but Mr. Walpole only
bowed very grave and precise, and turned away, and I with him. And
no more circles for me, my dear; and here I conclude, and my next
shall be the epithalamium.</p>
<p><i>18th May</i>, 1759.</p>
<p>Kitty, child, when you was married, did you look about you from
under your hat?&mdash;did you take a sly peep at the World, the
Flesh, and the Devil, and wonder which was the bridegroom? I did,
but I'll never tell which he proved to be! Well, Maria was married
two days since, and Horry Walpole favoured me today with a glimpse
of the letter he writ to his friend Montagu on the occasion. 'Twas
very obliging; but you know all he writes is writ with one eye on
the paper and one on posterity, so 'tis no wonder if he squints a
little by times. However, here's to our letter.</p>
<p>"The original day was not once put off&mdash;lawyers and
milliners all canonically ready. They were married in Pall Mall
just before dinner, and we all dined there, and the Earl and the
new Countess got into their post-chaise at eight and went to
Navestock alone. On Sunday she is to be presented and to make my
Lady Coventry distracted. Maria was in a white and silver night
gown, with a hat very much pulled over her face. What one could see
of it was handsomer than ever. A cold maiden blush gave her the
sweetest delicacy in the world."</p>
<p>So far our doting uncle, Kitty; but 'tis indeed a fair creature.
I saw the long soft brown eyes lifted once and flash such a look at
the bridegroom&mdash; I dare to swear Lord Waldegrave wished away
then the twenty years between them. Poor Lady Coventry, indeed! Her
race is run, her thread is spun, her goose is cooked, and any other
trope you please; for what signifies all the white lead at the
'pothecary's compared to the warm brown of Maria's complexion and
her long eyelashes!</p>
<p>Lady Elizabeth Keppel had a gown worthy of the Roman Empress she
looks, with that beak nose and nutcracker chin. 'Twas a black
velvet petticoat, embroidered in chenille, the pattern a great gold
wicker basket filled to spilling over with ramping flowers that
climbed and grew all about her person. A design for a banqueting
hall rather than a woman; or indeed a committee of Bluestockings
might have wore it to advantage. She had winkers of lace to her
head, and her hoop covered so many acres that one could but
approach at an awful distance and confidences were
impossible&mdash;a sure reason why the modish ladies will soon drop
the hoop.</p>
<p>I saluted the bride after the ceremony and says I:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Maria, my love, I attend your presentation on Sunday, and I
bring my smelling-bottle for Lady Coventry. 'Tis already said her
guards will now be transferred to your ladyship, together with a
detachment from each ship of the Fleet, to secure so much
beauty."</p>
<p>She has the sweetest little dimple in either cheek, and twenty
Cupids hide under her lashes.</p>
<p>"I have no wish, Madam, to dethrone my Lady Coventry, if even
'twere possible," says she. "That lady has occupied the throne so
long, that 'tis hers by right, and the English people never weary
of an old favourite."</p>
<p>'Twas two-edged, Kitty, as you see, and I will report it to the
other lovely Maria, and 'twill be pretty to see the rapiers flash
between the two. 'Tis not only the men carry dress swords, child.
But I thought Miss Maria a downy nestling, with never a thought of
repartee, till now. 'Tis born in us, child. It begins with our
first word and is our last earthly sigh.</p>
<p><i>May</i>, 1759.</p>
<p>Well, was you at the presentation, Lady Desmond, for I did not
see your la'ship.</p>
<p>Says you: "How was that possible with the Irish Sea between us?
So out with the news!"</p>
<p>The company was numerous and magnificent, and Horry Walpole in
his wedding garment of a white brocade with purple and green
flowers. 'Twas a trifle juvenile for his looks, but I blame him
not; for my Lady Townshend would choose for him, though he
protested that, however young he might be in spirits, his bloom was
a little past. I could see he was quaking for his
nuptialities&mdash;lest Maria should not be in full beauty.</p>
<p>T'other Maria,&mdash;Coventry,&mdash;in golden flowers on a
silver ground, looked like the Queen of Sheba; and were not our
Monarch anything but a Solomon, I would not say but&mdash;A full
stop to all naughtiness! But I must tell you her last <i>faux
pas</i>, for you know, child, she's as stupid as she's pretty. She
told the King lately that she was surfeited with sights. There was
but one left she could long to see. What, think you, it
was?&mdash;why, a coronation!</p>
<p>The old man took it with good humour; but Queen Bess had made a
divorce between her lovely head and shoulders for less.</p>
<p>Well, into the midst of this prodigious assemblage, with Uncle
Horry quaking inwardly and making as though Walpole nieces were
presented every day, comes the fair Waldegrave, gliding like a
swan, perfectly easy and genteel, in a silver gauze with knots of
silver ribbon and diamonds not so bright as her eyes. I dare swear
not a man there but envied my Lord Waldegrave, and many might envy
the beauty her husband&mdash;a good plain man, grave and handsome.
But the bride! She swam up to His Majesty, like Venus floating on
clouds, and her curtsey and hand-kissing perfect. Who shall talk of
blood in future, when a milliner's daughter can thus distinguish
herself in the finest company in Europe? 'Tis true 'tis mixed with
the Walpole vintage; but when all's said and done, who were the
Walpoles? If you get behind the coarse, drinking Squire Western of
a father, you stumble up against Lord Mayors and what not! So 'tis
a world's wonder, and there I leave it.</p>
<p>As for Maria Coventry&mdash;do but figure her! I saw her pale
under her rouge when the bride entered, and her eyes shot sparks of
fire, like an angry goddess. Could they have destroyed, we had seen
her rival a heap of ashes like the princess of the Arabian Nights.
I tendered her my smelling-bottle, but she dashed it from her, and
then, smiling in the prettiest manner in the world, says to my Lord
Hardwicke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Tis said women are jealous of each other's good looks, my
Lord, but 'tis not so with me. I am vastly pleased with my Lady
Waldegrave's appearance. 'Tis far beyond what was to be expected of
her parentage. She looks vastly agreeable, and I hope she will
favour me with her company."</p>
<p>'Twas cleverer than I supposed her, and sure enough she did
nothing but court the bride, and now the two beauties go about to
the sights and routs together and are the top figures in town, and
all the world feasts its eyes upon two such works of
nature&mdash;and Art it must be added, so far as Maria Coventry is
concerned; she is two inches deep in white lead, and the doctors
have warned her 'twill be the death of her. Kitty, I found my first
gray hair yesterday. 'Tis my swan song. I am done with the beaux
and the toasts and the fripperies. When I spoke to Harry Conway at
the Court, his eyes were so fixed on Lady Waldegrave that he heard
me not till I had spoke three times. Get thee to a nunnery, Fanny!
I shall now insensibly drop into a spectatress. What care I! To
ninety-nine women life ends with their looks, but I will be the
hundredth, and laugh till I die!</p>
<p>Why, Kitty, your appetite for news grows by what it feeds on.
Sure you are the horseleech's true daughter, crying, "Give, give!"
You say I told you not of Charlotte Walpole's marriage. Sure, I
did. Maria married her sister well&mdash;to young Lord
Huntingtower, my Lord Dysart's son. 'Tis a girl of good sense. She
loved him not, nor yet pretended to, but says she to
Maria:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If I was nineteen, I would not marry him. I would refuse
point-blank. But I am two-and-twenty, and though 'tis true some
people say I am handsome, 'tis not all who think so. I believe the
truth is, I am like to be large and heavy and go off soon. 'Tis
dangerous to refuse so good a match. Therefore tell him, sister, I
accept."</p>
<p>And 'twas done. I had this from Maria herself, who took it for
an instance of commendable good sense; but I know not&mdash;somehow
I would have a girl less of a Jew with her charms. Anyhow, stout or
no, she will be my Lady Countess Dysart when his father dies; and
now sure, there are no more worlds left for the Walpole girls to
conquer. Their doting Uncle Horry could never predict such success.
The eldest girl's husband is now Bishop of Exeter.</p>
<p>Poor Maria Coventry is dead&mdash;the most lovely woman in
England, setting aside only t' other Maria. 'Twas from usage of
white lead, Kitty, and tell that to all the little fools you know!
It devoured her skin, and she grew so hideous, that at the last she
would not permit the doctors to see her ruined face, but would put
out her hand between the curtains to have her pulse took. She was
but twenty-seven years of age.</p>
<p>There was not a woman in the Three Kingdoms but envied the
Gunnings, and was 't not yourself told me, "the Luck of the
Gunnings" was become a proverb in Ireland, and the highest wish for
a girl? What will the sermonizers say now? That 'tis best to be
homely and live to eighty? I know not; but 'tis as well the choice
is not given, for I believe there is not ten women living but would
choose as did Maria Coventry. Her beauty was her god, and if she
sacrificed herself on the altar, 'tis but what the gods look
for.</p>
<p>Sure, I am Death's herald, for I must tell you my Lord
Waldegrave is dead of the smallpox, and the beauty a widow after
but four years' marriage. I saw her but yesterday, full of
sensibility and lovely as Sigismonda in Hogarth's picture. She had
her young daughter, Lady Elizabeth, in her lap, the curly head
against her bosom, the chubby cheek resting on a little hand
against the mother's breast. Sure never was anything so moving as
the two&mdash;exact to the picture Mr Reynolds painted.</p>
<p>She has a great tenderness for his memory, and well she may,
when the position he raised her to is considered. 'T is like a
discrowned queen, for her jointure is small, and she is now no more
consequence to his party, so his death has struck away her worldly
glory at a blow. Indeed, I pitied her, and wiped away her floods of
tears with tenderness that was unaffected. But for such a young
woman, I won't believe the scene is closed. What&mdash;are there no
marquises, no dukes, for such perfection?</p>
<p>But 't is brutal to talk so when she is crying her fine eyes
out. I wipe my naughty pen and bid you adieu.</p>
<p><i>Two days later.</i></p>
<p>I attended Mrs Minerva Montagu's reception, and there
encountered the Great Cham of Literature, Dr Johnson, rolling into
the saloon like Behemoth. Lady Waldegrave's bereavement was spoke
of and says he:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I know not, Madam, why these afflictions should startle us.
Such beauty invokes ill fortune, lest a human being suppose herself
superior to the dictates of Providence."</p>
<p>"Certainly she is the first woman in England for beauty," says
I, very nettled; "but 't is to be thought she had chose a little
less beauty and rather more good fortune, had she been consulted.
'T is hard she should be punished for what she could not help!"</p>
<p>"Let her solace herself with her needleworks, Madam. A man
cannot hem a pocket handkerchief and so he runs mad. To be occupied
on small occasions is one of the great felicities of the female
train and makes bereavement more bearable."</p>
<p>'T is a bear roaring his ignorance of the world, my dear. But he
has a kind of horse sense (if the female train would but let him
be) that makes him endurable and even palatable at times.</p>
<p>Mrs. Montagu informed us 't is rumoured that my Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu (who you know is her cousin's cousin) thinks to
return to England after being absent half a lifetime. I have a
prodigious curiosity to see such a rarity. As for her beauty, that
must be vanished, but her biting wit may outlive it, and Heaven
send her here safe, I pray, to give a lash to the follies of more
than one I could name, had I the malice. Were she to write a book
of her life, 't would be the best reading in the world, could one
wash their eyes and mind after reading it.</p>
<p>1764.</p>
<p>Kitty, my dear, have you forgot that, when my Lord Waldegrave
died, I writ, "Are there no dukes to pursue the lovely widow?" Give
honour to the prophet! She refused the Duke of Portland, that all
the fair were hunting with stratagems worthy of the Mohawks. She
refused this, that, and t' other. And the town said: "Pray who is
the milliner's daughter, to turn up her nose at the first matches
in England? Has she designs on the King of Prussia,&mdash;for our
own young monarch is wed to his Charlotte,&mdash;or is it the
Sultan, or His Holiness the Pope that will content her
ladyship?"</p>
<p>No answer. But, Kitty, 't is me to smell a rat at a considerable
distance, and I kept my nostrils open! Our handsome young King has
a handsome young brother,&mdash;His Royal Highness the Duke of
Gloucester,&mdash;and this gentleman has cast the sheep's eye, the
eye of passion, upon our lovely widow! What think you of this? That
it cannot be? Then what of the King Cophetua and other historic
examples? I would have you know that in the tender passion there's
nothing that cannot be. It laughs at obstacles and rides triumphant
on the crest of the impossible. I knew it long since, but 't is
over the town like wildfire now.</p>
<p>Meeting my Lady Sarah Bunbury yesterday, says she:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lady Fanny, sure you know the Duke of Gloucester is desperately
in love with my Lady Waldegrave. Now don't mask your little cunning
face with ignorance, but tell me what's known. What have you heard
from Horry Walpole?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, your la'ship," says I, very demure.</p>
<p>"Well," says she, "'t is reported the King has forbid him to
speak to his fair widow, and she is gone out of town. He has given
her two pearl bracelets worth five hundred pound. That's not for
nothing surely. But for what?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, 't is an ambiguous gift, Madam," says I, whimsically;
"and may mean much or little. Give me leave to ask whether 't is
Pursuit or Attainment as your la'ship reads it?"</p>
<p>But she tossed her head, the little gossip, and off she
went.</p>
<p>I can tell you thus much, Kitty: the Walpoles are main
frightened. It may be a cast-back to the principles of the milliner
mother. And there was never the difference between her and Sir
Edward Walpole that there is between Maria and a Prince of the
Blood. Her birth is impossible. My Lady Mary Coke asking me if the
mother were not a washerwoman, says I, "I really cannot determine
the lady's profession."</p>
<p>Poor Lady Mary is run clean mad with jealousy and spite, for 't
is not so long since she believed herself on the way to be a Royal
Duchess, imagining the late Duke of York to be her lover&mdash;a
gentleman so passionately in love with himself as to leave no room
for another. She wore her blacks when he died, like a widow. But,
spitfire as Lady Mary is, 't is too true Maria is playing with
fire, and there should be nothing between him and her mother's
daughter. She is indeed more indiscreet than becomes her. His
chaise is eternally at her door; and, as my Lady Mary says, she is
lucky that anyone else countenances her at all. If they do, 't is
as much from curiosity as any nobler emotion. Indeed, I fear her
reputation's cracked past repair. Meeting Horry Walpole last night
at the French Embassador's, he was plagued with staring crowds, and
he made off after braving it a while. I hear the King is highly
offended and the Queen yet more. She has a great notion of birth;
and though poor, the Mecklenburg family has as good quarterings as
any Royals in Europe. For my part, Kitty, I know not. Yet, if we
seek for pedigree in horse and dog, 't is to be supposed worth
something in Adam's breed also. And this ill-behaviour in Maria
confirms me.</p>
<p>Yet I have visited the fair sinner, for I love her well. She
can't help neither her birth nor her beauty, but sure her kind
heart is all her own. She wept and would reveal nothing, but asked
me to be so much her friend as to think the best of her. 'T is pity
her tears were wasted on a mere woman. The drops beaded on her
lashes like rain on a rose. Well, God mend all! say I. Sure none of
us have a clear conscience and if anyone was to come up behind us
and whisper, "I know when, how, and who!" 't is certain there are
few women but would die of terror. Yet I did not think Maria a
rake&mdash;though a Prince's.</p>
<p>'T is pity Lady Mary, the Great Wortley Montagu, is dead, that
would have relished all this talk to the full. Can I forget when I
visited her two years since just before she died&mdash;her vivacity
and the tales she told of the junketings of Queen Anne's Court and
George the First's! Gracious powers, Kitty, to think of our
grandmothers' conduct and our own excellence in comparison! I have
not heard a scandal since, but I have vied it with theirs and found
it a mere caprice. 'T was almost affrighting to see that old lady,
propped up in her chair, and croaking out tales of the grandparents
of every person known to me, not forgetting my own, and laughing
with a horrid glee and a fire in her ancient eye, till I expected
to see her fly off like a witch on a broomstick. Sure, thinks I, no
respectable young woman will be seen conversing with her
grandmother after this! Mrs Montagu carried me to see her, and I
could scarce thank her for it. Lord help us! does the world grow
better or worse? I must take Mr Walpole's opinion.</p>
<p>1772.</p>
<p>Kitty, Kitty, 't is all come out! But I may say the town knew it
after the masquerade in Soho, when His Royal Highness appeared as
Edward the Fourth and Maria as Elizabeth Woodville, the pretty
widow he made his Queen. You'll allow 't was a delicate way to let
the cat out of the bag. It could not longer be kept within it, for
the lady's sake and more. For there's to be a little new claimant
one day to the Crown, if all the elder stem should fail.</p>
<p>They were married, Kitty, in <i>1766!</i> Sure never was an
amazing secret better kept! And I will say she hath borne much for
the Prince's sake, and with good sense&mdash;let my Lady Mary Coke
and all the Furies say what they will. But think of it&mdash;think
of it! for indeed 't is scarce credible. Here's Maria
No-name&mdash;the milliner's base-born daughter&mdash;to be Her
Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester, Princess of Great
Britain! Was ever human fate so surprising? 'Twas a secret even
from her father and uncle, by the Duke's command; but she has now
writ her father so pretty a letter that 'tis the town's talk, Horry
Walpole having shewed it about. But Horry&mdash;have you forgot his
pride, hid always under a nonchalance as if't was nothing? I was at
Gloucester House, where she received <i>en princesse</i>, two
nights ago; and to see Horry kiss her hand and hear him address her
with, "Madam, your Royal Highness," at every word&mdash;sure no wit
of Congreve's could ever equal the comedy! But if looks were all,
she should be Queen of England&mdash;a shining beauty indeed! She
wore a robe in the French taste, of gold tissue, her hair lightly
powdered, with a bandeau of diamonds and the Duke's miniature in
diamonds on her breast. He, looking very ill at ease, as I must
own, stood beside her.</p>
<p>The King and our little Mecklenburger Queen are distracted; the
royal ire withers all before it; but it can't be undone, though
they will pass a Marriage Act to make such escapades impossible in
the future.</p>
<p>But the Walpole triumph! 'Tis now proved in the face of all the
world that a Walpole illegitimate is better than a German Royalty;
for he might have married where he would. No doubt but Horry
Walpole always thought so, yet 'tis not always we see our family
pride so bolstered.</p>
<p>Meagre as a skeleton, he looked the genteelest phantom you can
conceive, in puce velvet and steel embroideries. For my part, I am
well content, and wish Her Royal Highness joy without grimace. 'Tis
true I laugh at Horry Walpole, for in this town we laugh at
everything, from the Almighty to Kitty Fisher; but I have a
kindness for him and for Maria, and had sooner they triumphed than
another. 'Tis not so with the town. O Kitty, the jealousy and
malice! 'Twould take fifty letters to tell you the talk, from the
Court down.</p>
<p>Well, Her Royal Highness gave me her hand to kiss, very
gracious. She will not let her dignity draggle in the mud, like
others I could name. But whether she would have been more easy with
Portland or another, I will not determine. The Fates alone know,
and sure they can't be women, they keep their secrets so well!</p>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>VI. A BLUESTOCKING AT COURT</h2>
<h4>Fanny Bueney<br>
Madame D'Arblay<br>
1752-1840</h4>
<p>"Send me a minute Journal of everything," begs Mr. Crisp, "and
never mind their being trifles&mdash;trifles well-dressed are
excellent food, and your cookery is with me of established
reputation."</p>
<p>Fanny Burney's letters, full of "trifles well-dressed" are as
delightful as the novels, "Evelina," "Cecilia," and "Camilla," that
made her famous. The skill of her writing and the charm of her
character, "half-and-half sense and modesty," won her the
friendship of Burke, Sheridan, Walpole, Warren Hastings, Hannah
More, the Queen, and Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p>"She is a real wonder," said Johnson to Mrs. Thrale.</p>
<p>When Queen Charlotte made her second-keeper of the robes, her
novel-reading friends protested that she had been "royally gagged
and promoted to fold muslins." After four years of it, she returned
to her home, her writing, and her marriage with General d'Arblay.
With the proceeds of her most profitable novel, she built Camilla
Cottage, where, with her good Alexandre and her gay little son, she
could live and write, "Pleasure is seated in London, joy, mirth,
society; but happiness, oh, it has taken its seat, its root, at
West Humble!" She lived to be eighty-eight.</p>
<p>Yet the world still thinks of her on those youthful visits at
Mrs. Thrale's in Streatham, when, if she seemed about to take her
leave, Dr. Johnson would exclaim, "Don't you go, little Burney,
don't you go!"</p>

<b><i>Fanny Burney, Madame D'Arblay</i></b></p>
<hr>
<p>[<i>The following is endorsed: "Miss P.'s Narrative of the
causes leading to the celebrated Miss Burney's retirement from
Court in the year 1791."</i>]@@The intention of this narrative of
Miss Burney's later residence at the Court of Their Majesties King
George the Third and Queen Charlotte is simple. I am informed that
reports spread among her friends have given birth to the notion
that she was harshly treated, her genius slighted, and herself
subjected to an odious tyranny from Mrs Schwellenberg, the Keeper
of the Robes, and that she fled from the scene of such cruelties as
the only means of preserving her health and life. As an eyewitness,
I may be permitted to set forth another view which, though
uncoloured by the rosy or lurid hues of the genius of the author of
"Evelina," may be received as a plain account of what took place,
especially with regard to the Honourable Colonel Digby and the
causes of the lady's quitting the circle of the attendants on
Royalty. These humble notes will not appear to the world until all
concerned are reposing in the dust of the tomb.</p>
<p>I had the distinction to be early made privy to Miss Burney's
intention to resign her appointment; but this less from any wish of
her own, than as I concluded from my own observation. She did not
suspect this, nor that the Queen's ready penetration had prepared
her also for the coming resignation before it was respectfully laid
at her feet. Indeed, much of what follows she was a total stranger
to, and might have found it difficult to credit had it been known
to her.</p>
<p>It was the custom that, while Her Majesty's head was powdering
and her powdering-gown had been placed upon the Royal person, she
should be left <i>sola</i> with her <i>friseur</i>, when she
usually read the newspapers. On a certain day, however, she
despatched Miss Burney for me, adding that she need not return; and
when I arrived, addressed me as follows&mdash;the man not
comprehending what was said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There is a little matter which I have wished to open with you.
I have some reason to believe Miss Burney's spirits a little sunk.
Do you, Miss P., remark any failure in this respect?"</p>
<p>Her Majesty, all sweetness and benignity, fixed her eyes on me
as well as the operation she was undergoing would permit (the man
casting clouds of powder about her), and awaited my reply. Much
embarrassed, for it is the first rule of courts to make no comment
on the affairs of others to the ear of Royalty, I stammered a few
words, to the effect that I thought Miss Burney imagined her health
a little declined, but could offer no opinion of my own.</p>
<p>"She is a lady," continued the Queen, "no longer in her first
youth, who has been accustomed to much adulation in her own circle,
and may miss that incense."</p>
<p>I murmured that it might be supposed the dignity of a life in
the Royal service&mdash;but was gently interrupted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"No. We have neither the time nor the inclination to make the
Court a Bluestocking circle, and Miss Burney may prefer such
surroundings. But, why I address you, my good Miss P., is to
enquire whether Miss Burney has made any observation, of course not
confidential, which would lead you to suppose her unsettled in her
intentions?"</p>
<p>I believed that I realised Her Majesty's views. She would
probably prefer that the severance should come from herself and not
from the lower quarter. Alas, how little did I do justice to the
benevolence of her character! I hurriedly replied that I knew
nothing of Miss B.'s mind further than all the world might know,
and within myself earnestly wished Her Majesty might turn the
subject of her remarks. She, however, thought proper to continue
with a mingled dignity and sweetness which distinguishes all she
utters.</p>
<p>"All this is spoke in a confidence which must not be broke. But
if there were any little agitation of the affections
which&mdash;"</p>
<p>Here the Royal speaker was herself interrupted by a cloud of
powder which the unconscious <i>friseur</i> flung over the edifice
then erecting. It gave me a moment for hasty reflection.
Impossible!&mdash;who could suppose that Her Majesty, in whose
presence every look was restrained, every word calculated, could
have remarked the preference by which I had long known Miss Burney
distinguished Colonel Digby? He, in the first anguish of
bereavement of a lovely and beloved partner, did undoubtedly seek
Miss Burney's sympathy. So much was visible to all. There was even
a certain luxury of grief,&mdash;a heightening of the
loss,&mdash;which gave his very handsome and attractive person an
interest few could resist. Many indeed might have been ready for
the tender office of consolatrix, but it was Miss Burney who was
specially chosen, and the conviction formed in my own mind that the
sympathy she so feelingly tendered was not untinged by a rosy flush
of expectation. The caution incident to life at Court hindered my
breathing so delicate a suspicion to any, and that Her Majesty's
calm but piercing eye should have discerned any preference did
indeed animate my soul with astonishment.</p>
<p>"Ma'am, your Majesty's observation so far exceeds my own poor
powers," said I fluttering, "that, while it is impossible for me to
deny, it is equally impossible for me to confirm it. Miss Burney's
superior talents, her reserve, constitute a barrier
which&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know&mdash;I knew," interrupted the Queen, "that I could not
expect any confirmation from you. You are discretion itself. I am
surrounded by discretion. We will not now pursue the subject
further. Will you oblige me, my good Miss P., by preparing the
pocket-case which I give Lady Harcourt today."</p>
<p>The hint was an order. I respectfully retired at once, leaving
Her Majesty almost concealed in the cloud of powder which was
casting about her headdress.</p>
<p>Any little unusual occurrence at Court causes comment, and I was
obliged to meet the questioning gaze of the ladies in attendance
with composure. I mentioned that Her Majesty had given me
directions about Lady Harcourt's pocket-case, and said no more.
Miss Burney followed me to the room where it was laid out in
readiness for wrapping&mdash;a trifle of extreme elegance, pink
satin spangled with silver and fitted with all the little furniture
of gold scissors, bodkins, thimble, and so forth, which the
venerated friend might accept as a compliment both royal and
affectionate. Miss Burney admired it with me.</p>
<p>"It resembles that formerly given to sweet Mrs Delany," said
she. "Dear excellence&mdash;sweet heavenly angel departed to her
kindred sphere! What wonder that Their Majesties' discernment
should single her out for the veneration due to age and piety so
unaffected. She is gone, but how will this gift presented to the
equally worthy Lady Harcourt bring the tear to her eye and the
almost pang of gratitude to her bosom!"</p>
<p>I made an appropriate reply, but reflected. These gushes of
feeling on the part of Miss Burney sometimes appeared to me a
little overwrought and designed to conceal a sharpness of wit and
observation which she feared to exercise in courtly circles. In
this resolve she was doubtless discreet, but it gave her
conversation a turn of unreality which impressed as might the use
of some perfume of Araby to conceal a less romantic odour. It
affected my own candour disagreeably. Possibly the praise received
by the author of "Evelina" might cause her to abandon the common
modes of conversation and talk literary, if I may so express it;
but it was, to my knowledge, a great disappointment to the Queen,
who loved good talk and in her position could expect but little of
it. She had formed great hopes of the wit and originality of Miss
Burney, and was always met only by a sentimental silence, coupled
with an affected modesty which promised nothing fresh. Her
reading-aloud was also not of a high order, and her slender
knowledge of books, apart from her own, astonished the hopeful
Queen, who had looked forward to much pleasing entertainment in her
company.</p>
<p>There were also other difficulties. Miss Burney's extreme
sensitiveness to her own dignity operated as a hindrance to herself
as well as her friends. Never can I forget her expression on
hearing that a bell was to be the means of her summons to attend
her Royal Mistress. She was ever ready to anticipate a slight; and
that I may not be supposed malicious in this statement, I will cite
what was said by her old friend, the brilliant Mrs Thrale-Piozzi on
this circumstance:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I live with her in a degree of pain which precludes
friendship&mdash;dare not ask her to buy me a ribbon&mdash;dare not
desire her to touch the bell, lest she should think herself
slighted."</p>
<p>It can readily be imagined that slights would in such a case be
imagined where none were intended.</p>
<p>It was a habit Miss Burney encouraged in herself to use the
longest words to express the simplest opinions. Colonel Manners,
who laughed at all and everyone, declared she had made the
illustrious Dr Johnson her model, and would slyly note down some of
her most flowing periods to deliver them, enhanced by humour, when
she had left the room. I mean only to imply that she chose the
<i>corporeal</i> style of the famous Doctor without acquiring the
zest and gusto of that great man.</p>
<p>But this is to digress.</p>
<p>"The equerries will attend us at tea today, Miss P.," she
observed. "Colonel Manners and Colonel Digby will be present and Mr
de la Giffardiere. Colonel Digby's spirits depend much
upon female support and sustentation. He loves to contemplate the
melancholy aspects in a way which cannot but be harmful to a
character so feeling."</p>
<p>I replied collectedly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Colonel Digby owes much to Miss Burney for all the consolations
of literature and religion so charitably offered. But indeed who
would not sympathise with his bereavement of a partner so lovely
that, should he ever think of replacing her, beauty of the first
order must be his object."</p>
<p>This was perhaps a little pointed, but I could never agree in Dr
Johnson's estimate of her as "Pretty Burney," and she was not
reckoned a pretty woman by others. She had not the graces of height
nor elegance in movement, and might in complexion be called a brown
woman. The eyes, while expressive, were decidedly green. If I add
that she slightly stooped, though by no means sufficiently to be a
deformity, and that her features were, on the whole pleasing, I
have been honest in my description.</p>
<p>While we were speaking, the Princess Royal entered, fresh and
bright as the day, to inspect the case and add to it her own little
tribute, a posy of beautiful satin flowers made by her own fair
hands. This she attached to the case.</p>
<p>"I really think it very pretty," she said, adding in the most
winning manner, "I hope Miss Burney and Miss P. approve it.
Princess Elizabeth's gift is a fairing from Cheltenham&mdash;a most
elegant little box, containing a bottle of rose perfume which came
to mama from India, in the great box from the Bengal Nabob."</p>
<p>This would add interest to the gift, these bottles consisting of
a minute tube of the precious oil of roses, enclosed, as it were,
in a thick tube of embossed glass, ornamented with gold and sealed.
Each of the lovely Princesses now brought her gift, and each spoke
with us with the most conciliatory softness. Princess Elizabeth
said laughing:&mdash;</p>
<p>"How go the equerries' teas, Miss Burney? Do they still insist
on their right to wait on you, even when Mrs Schwellenberg is
present?"</p>
<p>Miss Burney curtseyed, a little out of countenance. I put in my
word:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, Ma'am, they are very constant. We have much entertainment
from Colonel Manners and Mr de la
Giffardiere&mdash;especially the latter."</p>
<p>"I can believe that," said she, laughing again. "His spirits
grow more boisterous daily. Mama says an hour of his company is
like a walk in a high wind. But you know how we all value and
respect him. What a contrast to poor Colonel Digby!"</p>
<p>"I imagine, Ma'am, that Colonel Digby too is recovering his
spirits a little under our united kind treatment. He was even
observed in a melancholy smile yesterday," said I.</p>
<p>Her Royal Highness smiled with a soft meaning kindness on Miss
Burney, whose eyes were fixed on the floor. This convinced me, if I
had needed conviction, that the Queen intended the allusion she had
made to Colonel Digby, and there had been a something in her tone,
indescribable but audible, which indicated disapproval. I
considered myself that the man had quite as much encouragement as
he needed if his intentions were serious. I could not make him out.
There were times when I saw a growing interest in Miss Burney, and
he indeed haunted her parlour; yet was I assured that in London he
was assiduous in waiting on Miss Gunning&mdash;a young lady with
every advantage of fortune, beauty, and connection. I own the
thought sometimes occurred to me that he might be that most
despicable of characters&mdash;a male flirt. I had thoughts
sometimes also of a word of warning to Miss Burney, but was
restrained by fear of her displeasure.</p>
<p>Two days later Colonel Manners and Colonel Digby waited on us to
tea, Mr de la Giffardiere following. Colonel Digby wore
his Vice-Chamberlain's uniform, being to wait on the Queen, and a
very handsome sight he made, adding all the advantages of birth and
breeding to extreme good looks. Miss Burney, with a pleasure she
could not conceal, found the conversation turn to "Evelina,"
Colonel Manners praised it in his gay light-hearted way, and
declared its special glory in his eyes to be the character of
Captain Mirvan. He asserted it was that which gave rise to the
suspicion that the author was a man, since a lady could scarcely be
supposed capable of drawing a portrait of such vulgarity in such
bold strokes. I now saw Miss Burney wavering whether to receive
this as compliment or insult, when immediately Colonel Manners,
whom no awe can check, broke out into Dibdin's song, applying it,
as it were, to Captain Mirvan:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
I've a spanking wife at Portsmouth Gates,
   A pigmy at Goree.
An orange-tawny up the Straits,
   A black at St. Lucie.
Thus whatsomedever course I bend
   I lead a jovial life&mdash;
</pre>
<p>Miss Burney rose indignantly, and the more so as Mr de la
Giffardiere, who could never resist the absurd, was applauding
vehemently, and even Colonel Digby smiling. She cast one awful
glance upon the offender, and was quitting the room, when Colonel
Digby threw himself in front of the door.</p>
<p>"Miss Burney shall not deprive us of the happiness of her
company without a word of entreaty," said he, fixing his eyes upon
hers, "My friend Manners would be the first to deplore having
offended the delicacy of any lady, and especially that lady whose
genius created Captain Mirvan. But Miss Burney will condescend upon
forgiveness when she hears he has been sharing His Majesty's barley
water after a day's hunting. It always goes to his head with most
boisterous results."</p>
<p>It was drolly said, indeed, though with his usual languor, and
no other intervention would have stopped the exit. She graciously
consented to return to her seat, and Colonel Manners immediately
and absurdly fell on his knees before her, offering to kiss her
shoe like the Pope's, if she would but pardon him.</p>
<p>"Alas, I was compelled to drink the barley water, Ma'am. I think
it right to be civil to the King, though Heaven knows a violent
drink like that is not what one should prefer after a hard day's
hunting. I had chose something milder, had it been in my
power."</p>
<p>She smiled faintly, and Colonel Digby, visibly to please her,
uttered a very handsome praise of "Cecilia," specially dwelling on
the chapter of the Opera Rehearsal. Her eyes followed his every
movement. I perceived but too well the growing interest, and pitied
the poor lady were her feelings to be deeply engaged; for I
believed he turned his melancholy to as good account with others as
with herself. I could not but note how his visits to her were made
at times when he could almost count upon finding her alone. If his
intentions were serious, all was well. Otherwise I could not
approve it.</p>
<p>"Miss Burney is so evidently the Muse of Comedy," cried Mr de la
Giffardiere, "that I wonder you, Manners, and you, Digby,
do not fear her ironic pen. What if she record this scene in the
third volume, for which all the world attends! There are only two
persons who will emerge with grace&mdash;Miss P. and myself. We
tread on awful ground with a lady so gifted."</p>
<p>Mrs. Schwellenberg now made her appearance, and the talk
changed, with Colonel Manners gravely enquiring after the health of
her pet frogs, and the gentlemen shortly after left, a circumstance
not very pleasing to her.</p>
<p>"What for they always&mdash;what you call&mdash;run away when I
come?" she cried. "I like it not. Or if he stay,&mdash;that Colonel
Manner,&mdash;he sleep! Sleeps he with you, Miss Burney? He sleep
always with me. It is not to bear!"</p>
<p>We could not forbear laughing, and it was goodhumouredly
taken.</p>
<p>The cloud of fearful blackness which was to overshadow the
nation soon broke upon us in His Majesty's illness. I had for some
time suspicion that all was not well. It was his habit to talk with
most condescending frankness to all whom he trusted, and I, as an
old servant, had the happiness to be thus honoured. It could,
therefore, be no secret to me that his mind was often agitated in
the highest degree about public matters, and to my thinking had
never recovered its tone since the disasters with regard to his
American colonies. His outward fortitude was astonishing at the
time of the rebellion; but it preyed inwardly and undoubtedly was
the first and most galling link in the chain of misfortune which
surrounded him from private and public sources. I have been told on
high authority that the falling of the largest diamond from the
Crown on the Coronation Day was a prognostic which His Majesty
supposed awfully fulfilled when those rebellious colonies broke
away from his sceptre.</p>
<p>It is not in my power, as it would not be my duty, to give an
account of circumstances which involved the whole nation in
mourning when it beheld the reason of its Monarch eclipsed. Be mine
rather the female task to describe how it affected the celebrated
lady who is the subject of these notes.</p>
<p>All then was confusion, and the habits of the Royal family so
intermitted, whether at Windsor or Kew, that those attached to the
household came and went as they pleased, although the strictest
inquisition followed all that was allowed to pass outside the
walls, lest reports adverse to His Majesty's health should reach
the party of the Princes, his sons, who caught eagerly at any facts
they might distort in a way to gain the Regency for the dissolute
Prince of Wales, and cast the Queen completely into his power. It
so happened that one day I was seated to my knotting behind the
Japan screen in the parlour apportioned by the Prince to Her
Majesty at Kew. My knotting had fallen on my knee as I gazed
pensively at the prospect of oaks and beeches in all their verdure,
when I heard voices, and Her Majesty and the Princess Royal
entered, talking earnestly as if continuing a conversation.</p>
<p>"Mama, I do indeed think the news is true, and if so you will
desire that we should soon give Colonel Digby joy. It is not
absolutely certain&mdash;"</p>
<p>Here I stepped forth from behind the screen, curtseying deeply.
The notion in my mind was that Colonel D. had announced his coming
engagement with Miss Burney. He had visited her sedulously during
the King's illness, and, I might add, somewhat in defiance of Her
Majesty's hints to that lady, and had brought his little son more
than once to visit her&mdash;a step which could not but appear very
particular.</p>
<p>The Queen saw me advance with her usual gracious composure, and
the Princess greeted me charmingly. She wore a morning
<i>nglige</i> embroidered all over with roses,
and looked what she was&mdash;the Rose of England.</p>
<p>"You have appeared at an opportune moment, Miss P.," said Her
Majesty.</p>
<p>"The matter in hand is one where I rely on your discretion.
Princess Royal, inform Miss P. of what you have heard."</p>
<p>She took her seat, and the sweet Princess, standing behind her
mother's chair, related to me with her own artless candour that she
had heard, from a source which she did not give, though
unimpeachable, that an engagement subsisted or shortly might
subsist between Colonel Digby and Miss Gunning, and she
thought&mdash;she feared&mdash;</p>
<p>Here she hesitated in the most pleasing manner. I now fully
understood, but it became me to remain silent and hear the Queen's
pleasure. My beloved Queen spoke presently and
even&mdash;marvellous to relate&mdash;with a touch of the gentle
archness which so adorned her before His Majesty's
all-overshadowing malady. Her fortitude was astonishing.</p>
<p>"My good Miss P., you have heard the Princess Royal, and I am
full sure the announcement you expected was of a kind far nearer
home. Am I wrong?"</p>
<p>I hurriedly said I had indeed expected and hoped&mdash;Her
Majesty would pardon my confusion. I scarce knew what I was saying,
for it rushed on my mind that, if this were true, the effect on
Miss Burney's health and spirits might be serious&mdash;his
attentions having been so public.</p>
<p>"I have noticed and heard how frequent Colonel Digby's visits to
her have been," continued Her Majesty; "and if this has reached me,
it is certain that others must have felt his attentions to be
particular. I cannot acquit him."</p>
<p>"Nor I, Ma'am," I cried eagerly, and interrupted myself in such
a breach of etiquette. She proceeded composedly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I believe Colonel Digby is frequently with Miss Burney. You
have the same impression, Princess Royal?"</p>
<p>The fair Princess softly murmured that she had. I could not but
suspect Mrs Schwellenberg the informant, nor yet blame her. All
must depend upon the colouring given.</p>
<p>"Colonel Digby's confidential favour with us all disappoints me
the more in the course he has taken," continued the Queen. "There
has been a touch of something insincere. And I have heard also that
the poor Schwellenberg is left entirely to herself while these
visits take place. I thought this hard and so dropped a hint to
Miss Burney, which I failed not to see was resented. Have you, my
good Miss P., observed anything of this?"</p>
<p>Catching the encouraging eye of the Princess, I ventured to say
I was not wholly a stranger to the fact that Mrs Schwellenberg felt
herself somewhat dropped out in these visits, so agreeable to the
gentleman. Miss Burney I alluded not to.</p>
<p>"Another hint I offered," proceeded the Queen, "when my hair was
dressing one night, and I was informed the Schwellenberg was very
unwell and needed company, but found Miss Burney was engaged as
usual with Colonel Digby. I asked Miss Burney, without leading up
to the subject, whether he had been here. She coloured very high
and admitted it and, on further questioning, displayed a knowledge
of all his movements which I own surprised me, especially on her
complaining of the want of variety here&mdash;a fact that made any
visitor welcome, as she told me."</p>
<p>"Can it be possible, Ma'am," I cried, "that at this time of
universal sorrow, Miss Burney should so far forget the cruel facts
as to reproach&mdash;"</p>
<p>I was softly interrupted in my turn.</p>
<p>"I am far from blaming Miss Burney," said the amiable Queen. "It
has been a time of gloom for all. I am only considering, from these
circumstances and others I could name, how sharp and severe may be
her disappointment when she hears the news which has reached the
Princess Royal."</p>
<p>Such goodness did, I confess, moisten my eyes, for had I been
the commentator, I might have been tempted to say that any little
coquetries were misplaced at a time of national grief, and
especially so in Miss Burney, whose extreme sensibility, somewhat
paraded in words, was in its highest flight as regarded the King's
health. Only that morning she had cried out:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What must be the guilt of that implacable country which, in
breaking away from his mild majestic sway, sowed the seeds of the
malady which reduced the best of kings and men to a condition where
this fell disease could prey upon his overcharged heart and brain!
Surely the blessing which disowns its present cannot attend its
future!"</p>
<p>But this is a digression.</p>
<p>"What we are to consider, Miss P.," said the benignant Queen,
"is how best to hint this news to Miss Burney so that her mind may
be gradually accustomed. It is to be remembered that, in her
confined home circle, she can have met but few so distinguished and
eligible as Colonel Digby. I am perhaps not wholly free of blame
from having introduced her to so new a sphere. I never contemplated
that she would so soon liberate herself from the control of the
Schwellenberg."</p>
<p>Gracious Powers! I, who had once accidentally heard Miss Burney
term Mrs S. "Cerbera," could have told Her Majesty that Miss Burney
was the last person in the world to permit Mrs S., or any other
person in the world, to control her, as might appear by her
rejoinders to Her Majesty herself.</p>
<p>"If," said the Princess, interposing with a gentle civility,
"such a hint could be dropped to Miss Burney, it might spare her
much pain. She is so gifted&mdash;so high-strung&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We leave it to your good heart," said the Queen. "We wish all
that is good to Miss Burney. You will see I cannot commit it to the
Schwellenberg. These literary ladies have high flights, I believe,
and are a more fragile porcelain than ordinary folks. Do your best,
my good Miss P., and I shall be well satisfied."</p>
<p>The Princess sweetly requested permission to retire with me and
we were about to withdraw, when the Duchess of Ancaster entered,
and the Queen informed her of Colonel Digby's supposed engagement.
The Duchess laughed with all her own humour.</p>
<p>"What, Ma'am? Miss Gunning? No, surely Miss Burney! I am Miss
Burney's advocate as regards her just rights and claims. Miss
Gunning is but an interloper.</p>
<p>"I will wager that Miss Burney at last secures Colonel Digby,
whatever his struggles. He is but a bird hovering a few inches
above the charming serpent's jaws, which are open to receive him. I
know not how our sex has ever acquired the reputation of flight,
for it has ever appeared to me that apparent flight was but a feint
to encourage pursuit not otherwise forthcoming. Believe me, Ma'am,
that your Majesty will yet see Colonel Digby overtaken and captured
by the united arts of 'Evelina' and 'Cecilia.'"</p>
<p>"Come, Duchess," said Her Majesty, with the little arch smile
she sometimes wears; "you would not have us believe the Duke made a
very desperate race of it, would you?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, Ma'am, I did my part as well as others," the kind
Duchess said, laughing, "and but for my efforts, who knows what
indiscretion he might have committed? Do but consider the late
marriages made by noble lords who shall be nameless! Miss Burney
probably is Colonel Digby's destined saviour, or so believes
herself."</p>
<p>So the lively lady rattled on, until I withdrew, following the
Princess.</p>
<p>"Pray do your best, Miss P.," she whispered softly at the door.
"I feel for poor Miss Burney&mdash;I do indeed. Colonel Digby has
been so particular in his attentions. And her health is never
strong."</p>
<p>She sighed as she glided off to join the Princess Elizabeth for
their sketching-lesson. Sure never was such a bouquet of beauty and
warm hearts as these Royal sisters! I know not which I can
distinguish more than another, though perhaps the Princess Royal is
my pattern for all that is excellent and sweet.</p>
<p>I took my doubting way to Miss Burney's parlour. She was
writing, as was her wont. If it were not another novel, it must
have been a daily mass of information to her friends. In all she
did seemed a little mystery that promoted not the unreserve so
essential to friendship. Perhaps it might be a part of the
profession of a writer of fiction; but it made itself felt.</p>
<p>She looked up smilingly.</p>
<p>"Pray take a seat, Miss P. I hope your gratifying entry is with
good news of that precious health on which Britain hangs. I hear
this black cloud begins to turn its silver edges."</p>
<p>I agreed, and she then spoke of cheerful details she had had
from Lady Charlotte Finch. It appeared that there were now much
longer intervals of rational quiet. He had alluded to public
matters with a piety and reason the most exalted, which moved all
who heard almost to tears. Oh, that those rebellious subjects
beyond the ocean could have heard their Monarch! Yet why should
this be my aspiration when there were rebels, and <i>filial
ones</i>, close at hand, to rejoice in his misfortune!</p>
<p>I was about to reply when the door opened without knocking, and
Colonel Digby glided in, with the words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"How does Miss Burney? May a friend, a friend of the
faithfulest, enter to make his enquiries?"</p>
<p>He did not perceive me behind the opened door. Miss Burney
blushed visibly, and instantly seeing me, he bowed with his own
finished good-breeding and no sign of discomposure. I sat, as it
were on thorns, until, Mr Smelt entering later, the talk became
general and I retreated, more and more confused at the part
expected of me, especially as Colonel Digby's manner appeared as
softly ingratiating as ever. I felt I should be compelled to sink
the truth a while longer and could only hope the Princess Royal
misinformed.</p>
<p>The coolness between Miss Burney and Mrs Schwellenberg about
this time began to be much warmed by many little kindnesses on the
part of the latter as she observed Miss Burney's somewhat careworn
brow. It has since been confided to me that the account given of
her by Miss Burney to her friends was one of uncontrolled
malignity; but though my testimony is humble, it is sincere, and I
can describe Mrs Schwellenberg, apart from her acknowledged
devotion to her Royal Mistress, as possessing a much more kindly
heart than Miss Burney would consent to allow her. Her imperfect
knowledge of English often did her an injustice and made it easy to
be witty at her expense. While she thought she saw Miss Burney
inflated with the pride of a caressed and flattered author, and
rebelling at the necessary restrictions of court life, she
certainly was watchful and sometimes disapproving; but in the time
of trouble she opened out into an attention which Miss Burney's
candour should have gratefully owned.</p>
<p>Time went on. Our beloved King recovered the use of his
invaluable senses, thus escaping the snares set for him and the
Queen by enemies the most difficult to subdue. This enabled us to
return in triumph to Windsor&mdash;in triumph, do I say? No, but
ecstasy&mdash;a kind of rapture which pervaded the whole nation,
excepting the party of the Opposition. The inhabitants of every
place we passed flooded out to greet their King. The people,
stirred as by an earthquake, broke upon him in a wave of loyalty;
and we, who almost adored him for his private benignity and public
virtues, seemed swept away in the torrent. As for the Queen, what
joy sat upon her sweet but wearied countenance, as she turned her
eyes, swimming in tears, upon him who was the centre of all
rejoicing!</p>
<p>I never came so near loving Miss Burney as when one day, in
walking with Her Majesty's little dogs, Badine and Phillis, in the
Park, she broke out into feelings warmly expressed of her sense of
what the Queen's conduct had been during the scenes of agony we had
witnessed. For once she forgot herself nobly, and I shall never
forget her countenance as she paused and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Indeed, Miss P., when I consider Her Majesty's complicated
suffering,&mdash; increased as it was to misery by attacks from
quarters whence only love and duty might have been expected,
harassed by politics and cabals, torn by national and foreign
dissension, herself deprived of all protection, and yet protecting
with almost masculine fortitude a beloved husband and King,&mdash;I
say with all my heart that to have attained such heights of
courage, resignation, and ability, is much, much more than to be
Queen of England, or possessed of the most shining genius the world
has known. I bow the knee in spirit as in body before a Mistress so
truly Royal."</p>
<p>The generous fire in her voice was quenched by the tears in her
eyes. I grasped her hand, but could not reply. Here was indeed the
cry of sincerity. We walked pensively for some time in the
shrubberies, and ended our airing on the great terrace.</p>
<p>How exquisitely pastoral, yet soul-stirring, is the view from
that majestic height! The towers of Windsor Castle behind us
breathing of the historic past; the Thames unrolling its silver
windings below; the meadows; the roofs of Eton College lifting
through the veil of foliage&mdash; can aught on earth surpass it? A
distant sound of cheering from the Eton playing-fields reached us,
to announce that some young votary of athletic games had reached
his goal. Over all floated the sunshine. Why seek foreign shores
for recreation which these sylvan bowers, so richly charged with
memories of departed greatness, afford to all?</p>
<p>A quick step on the gravel roused me from these thoughts and,
turning, I saw Colonel Digby proceeding quickly to the Queen's
Lodge. To my astonishment he only bowed hurriedly and went on his
way without a word. Miss Burney looked the amazement she naturally
felt; and it flashed across my mind that here might be the
long-sought opportunity. I seized it with a beating heart.</p>
<p>"We have seen but little of Colonel Digby since the King's
recovery," said I.</p>
<p>"Oh," she replied nervously, "you know the King's attachment to
him, and also the Queen's; they impose on him many important
errands to London. We cannot expect&mdash;I should be the
last&mdash;"</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>"He has many friends in London," I ventured.</p>
<p>"Certainly. A disposition so generous, affectionate, and kind
must be entitled to all the blessings of friendship."</p>
<p>"And even warmer sentiments&mdash;" I hesitated.</p>
<p>She turned her face from me, but I could see the perturbation. I
would not for the world that she should misconceive me then. Though
feeling to the full the difficulty of my position, I tried to turn
it lightly.</p>
<p>"There is one fair lady in London who is said to have a warmer
interest in His Majesty's recovery, since it enables Colonel Digby
to be more constant in his attendance."</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>
<p>"You allude to Miss Gunning," she replied coldly. "On the few
occasions I have seen her I have thought her so cool in her likings
and sentiments, so self-sufficient, that I could not think her
attractive to a nature so warm as Colonel Digby's. Nor do I think
her mental attainments such as to render a real friendship possible
between them."</p>
<p>"It is difficult," I breathed, "to name the qualities which
attract the other sex. But I have heard certain rumours to the
effect that Colonel Digby finds Miss Gunning attractive."</p>
<p>She flashed her eyes on me with a kind of indignant scorn, as if
suspecting some meaner motive in what I said, and coolly consulted
her watch.</p>
<p>"I too have heard those rumours and their denial. We must
return, though I am loath to quit this enchanting scene. Shall I
leave you, or shall we return together?"</p>
<p>We walked in silence, I feeling I had miserably failed in my
commission, and she discoursing of the national fetes in
prospect, in a way which bespoke her hurry of spirits.</p>
<p>A few days later, Colonel Gwynn came into waiting, and told us
Colonel Digby was taken ill in London and could not hope to resume
his duties for some time. I saw the concern on Miss Burney's face.
We all shared it in a measure but, alas, her pallor showed but too
well how deep the shaft had pierced.</p>
<p>I was present that evening when she was in attendance on the
Queen. Her Majesty, rousing herself from thought, said somewhat
abruptly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am much displeased with Colonel Digby" (instancing her
reasons and adding): "He will not come here. He has set his mind
against coming. For some reason he cannot bear it. He has been in
London in perfect health, and I have it on good authority that he
desired it might not be told here."</p>
<p>I dared scarcely glance at Miss Burney. She was perfectly white
and stood with her eyes fixed on the ground. The Queen, seeing she
had alarmed us, glided with her benignant grace into another
subject. I, who knew her mind, could perceive what was intended;
but to Miss Burney it must have been a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Next morning the Princess Royal, coming to my room, lovely in
her flowered sacque, and without her hoop, her curls twisted with
rose-hued ribbons, seemed to cast a radiance before her. She paused
at the door, and said condescendingly: "May I come in?"</p>
<p>I hastened to set her a chair, and after a little indifferent
discourse she said with a touch of melancholy:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I think Miss Burney has not been fairly treated. It is the
Queen's opinion that Colonel Digby's conscience prevents his coming
hither. We are to offer our formal congratulations to him and Miss
Gunning at the Drawing-Room. I own I shall present mine with very
little heart. Do you not think, Miss P., that the poor lady should
be told the truth? It might come as a shock, but would be best from
a friend like yourself. If all else failed, I would gladly do it.
But indeed, I dare not."</p>
<p>I implored Her Royal Highness not to put herself out. I would be
the messenger.</p>
<p>"That Miss Burney should have been given any pain under our
roof, and by one connected with our service, is very painful to
mama, who fully values Miss Burney's gifts of the mind," added the
beloved Princess. "If it is to be done, however, there is no time
like the present, for the news is now very generally known."</p>
<p>She left me, and with a trembling step I rose to seek Miss
Burney's room. She was seated by the window, a large black hat with
ostrich plumes shading her face, and a muslin handkerchief folded
across the bosom. I had never seen her look so becoming. She was
then thirty-seven or-eight years of age, as I have since learned
(for that was then a carefully guarded secret), but did not look
near so much; and her expression, intensely absorbed, had the
pensive sweetness of a day in autumn ere the golden leaf yet
flutters to its fall.</p>
<p>"Miss Burney," I said timidly, "I believe I intrude, but may I
ask you to favour me with the copy of verses you made for Her
Majesty on 'The Great Coat.'"</p>
<p>This was graciously granted, and a seat offered. A light
conversation ensued, and at last, summoning my resolution, I
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We are soon to congratulate an old friend on his approaching
nuptials.</p>
<p>Colonel Digby&mdash;"</p>
<p>She turned angrily, but restrained herself with a distressing
effort. I continued: "I hear his engagement with Miss Gunning is
confirmed."</p>
<p>"I too have heard it," she said haughtily; "I am therefore no
stranger to your news."</p>
<p>She half rose, and taking the hint I hurried away, confident
that she believed me not at all. I met the Princess Royal with
Princess Augusta on my way, and they stopped me eagerly.</p>
<p>"Did you succeed, Miss P.?" asked each fair sister, with such
sympathising faces as made me love them the better, if that were
possible. The elder Princess shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>"Poor, poor lady! I fear he is a very heartless man. I cannot
easily forgive this treatment of one we esteem."</p>
<p>She linked her arm in her sister's, and the two hurried away to
attend the Queen, who was to consider their Drawing-Room robes just
then inspecting.</p>
<p>Willingly would I have softened the blow, but fall at length it
must! After the Drawing-Room, it became known to Miss Burney that
Miss Gunning had attended and had been given joy by all the
Princesses. The Princess Royal herself breathed this, with a voice
like a dove and her eyes considerately averted, adding:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Miss Gunning was most elegant in a dress of purple gauze and
silver; but I cannot think her beautiful, though some find her
manners pleasing.</p>
<p>Colonel Digby was not present."</p>
<p>There was a pause and then Miss Burney, deplorably pale,
replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I had already heard this, Ma'am. I believe she is thought
handsome. The Drawing-Room must have been particularly elegant from
the rejoicing crowds who would wish to pay their duty."</p>
<p>No more was said on the subject. Later, she complained of
headache to me, and I, breathing it into the sympathising ear of
Her Royal Highness, Miss Burney was recommended, nay, commanded to
return to her room, and the truly amiable Queen dispensed with her
attendance.</p>
<p>The marriage took place in due course, and in a private house, a
circumstance which met with Her Majesty's warm disapproval, as
considering that a contract so solemn needs all the blessing and
ratification imposed at such tunes by the church's ordinance.</p>
<p>During all this tune, Colonel Digby did not appear at Court,
though whether by his own choice or the kind concern of Her
Majesty, I cannot tell. Miss Burney visibly drooped&mdash;I could
see suffering written on her face, and it awoke a sympathy which I
dared not offer. The Queen's consideration for her increased, and
the lovely Princesses avoided with true delicacy every subject
which could recall the image of the past, making what soft amends
lay in their power.</p>
<p>Yet but a very short while after, will it be believed that
Colonel Digby sent his bride to call upon Miss Burney, having
himself resumed attendance upon the Court immediately after his
marriage! I sincerely felt for Miss Burney when a bustle was heard
and before us there appeared the bride, glowing in health and
happiness, and dressed in the last perfection of the milliner's
art. Triumph, visible and exultant, sat on her brow; and as she
took her place on the sofa by Miss Burney, who looked wan and aged
beside so much splendour, I felt it would have declared a better
heart had she deferred her visit. Miss Burney, with an effort of
courage, parried all the speeches which could hardly fail to have
the appearance of thrusts, and undertook to deliver the bride's
duty to the Queen with a calmness which did her honour.</p>
<p>I have more than once in my life seen reason to congratulate
myself on passing through life untroubled by the attentions of that
sex which, while the blessing, is also the curse of our own, and
felt this with peculiar energy during that scene, when I saw one so
justly celebrated, triumphed over almost publicly by a young lady
whose face was her chief recommendation.</p>
<p>I concluded that we should soon now lose Miss Burney and could
not harshly censure (though disapproving) the course she took in
attributing her waning health to the tyranny of Mrs Schwellenberg
and even to the hardships of her attendance on the Queen.
Nevertheless, Her Majesty more than once favoured me with the
remark:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Large allowance must be made for Miss Burney. I foresee she
will before long wish to be among the healing influences of her own
home circle; and as I would not for the world dismiss her, all must
be done on the foot she herself chooses, and with reluctance on my
part. I know her good sense will dictate a commendable course."</p>
<p>Of this I was by no means certain, but could, of course, make no
rejoinder; and Her Majesty's face, beneath her becoming fly-cap,
beamed with a true benevolence as she pronounced these words. I
have certain knowledge that she favoured Mrs Schwellenberg also
with this injunction, and that she also exerted herself to show
many little pleasing attentions on our return to Windsor. It was
that day Miss Burney came in, with an animation to which she had
long been a stranger, to say she had met Mr Boswell&mdash;friend
and survivor of the Great Lexicographer&mdash;near St. George's
Chapel, on his way to view the alterations, and he had arrested her
steps.</p>
<p>"It was like a breath of fresh air in a shut room!" she cried;
"and indeed almost too much for my weak health. 'O Ma'am,' he said
with energy, 'when do you return to us? You must resign&mdash;you
must indeed. It won't do, Ma'am. We can put up with it no longer!'
I laughed and stared, but he continued: 'We shall address Dr Burney
in a body. It was so resolved at the Club last week&mdash;Charles
Fox in the chair. I need your aid in my book on the Great Man, soon
to appear. You are to lighten the picture. In my hands he is grave
Sam, great Sam, learned Sam. With your aid we will deck him with
all the graces. He shall be gay Sam, agreeable Sam, and, to that
end, I claim all the little pleasing billets he has written to your
fair self.' So he rattled on, and I could with difficulty extricate
myself. But, O Miss P., though your goodness will not repeat the
scene, it was such a view of home and its surroundings as may greet
the returning sailor when his country rises on his view."</p>
<p>I sympathised and venturesomely said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I would not presume to counsel, Miss Burney, but if you so
crave for your family and friends, were it not well to seek their
healing company? None can doubt that your health suffers under the
restraints of court life, and Miss Burney's is a health valuable to
the world at large."</p>
<p>I ever found that a little well-turned compliment softened her
sense of injury. She smiled gratefully upon me and was silent; then
softly pressed my hand.</p>
<p>I related this little scene to the tender-hearted Princess Royal
who took the pains to make an opportunity with Miss Burney, when we
were in attendance for that walk on the Windsor Terrace which so
often presented the Royal Family to the view of a delighted people.
The procession was not yet formed, Their Majesties not having
appeared. She detached herself from her group of sweet sisters,
holding the little darling Princess Amelia by the hand, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Are you fit for the walk, Miss Burney? You appear tired and
unwell.</p>
<p>Permit me to make your excuses to the Queen."</p>
<p>She paused, and Miss Burney warmly thanked her and said
tremblingly that she believed she could support herself through the
walk.</p>
<p>"But why?" exclaimed Her Royal Highness. "Indeed, we are not
such tyrants, and allow me to say, my dear Miss Burney, that if you
should feel&mdash;should think you need a long rest&mdash;<i>a
releasing</i> rest, there need be no hesitation in mentioning it to
the Queen."</p>
<p>She repeated this with emphasis and glided away. I saw Miss
Burney's eyes moisten as she turned and retreated.</p>
<p>Events now succeeded each other slowly but surely. The Queen had
with reluctance accepted her resignation, the successor had been
found, and the time drew near for departure when, most
unexpectedly, my whole view was changed with regard to Miss
Burney's feelings.</p>
<p>We were walking in the Park on a fine sunny day, having chosen
the Long Walk which leads to the eminence and its noble prospect of
the Castle, though scarcely with hope of reaching it so slow were
our footsteps. I had led the talk to her writings and she gave me
some interesting particulars of the praise "Evelina" had received
from such judges as Mrs Delany and the Duchess of Portland, who
agreed in thinking it a book likely to do more good than any other
ever published, from its high principles wrapped in a glitter of
entertainment. This was a subject on which she never wearied, and I
was pressing for its continuance, when we beheld a lady
approaching, leaning on a gentleman's arm&mdash;a handsome woman in
a rich pelerine and jewellery&mdash;and with a start my companion
caught my arm, crying softly: "Mrs Thrale&mdash;Mrs Piozzi. Good
heavens! For years we have not met. Oh, could we escape."</p>
<p>I was no stranger to the fact that they had been the closest
friends and that Mrs Thrale's most injudicious marriage with a
Roman Catholic and a foreigner had ruptured the friendship on Miss
Burney's very proper objection to such an alliance. It is known how
society, how even the papers, rung with the scandal of a lady of
birth and fortune thus forgetting what was due to herself and
others. And a fresh blaze had lately been kindled by the
publication of Dr Johnson's Letters and many anecdotes relative to
the life at L&gt;treatham, all of which Miss Burney had entirely
disapproved. I could not sympathise with Mrs Thrale-Piozzi&mdash;
impossible that any right-minded person should, but I own to the
deepest curiosity to see her, and above all to witness her meeting
with this discarded friend, having understood from my own friends
that feeling run very high between them. Consequently I did not
hurry my steps.</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake, hasten!" cried Miss Burney. "'T is Mr Piozzi
himself.</p>
<p>Was ever anything so mortifying!"</p>
<p>Unfortunately Mrs Piozzi heard these words and recognised the
speaker.</p>
<p>"Mortify not yourself, Miss Burney, I entreat. Mr Piozzi is
obliged to hasten into Windsor to bespeak apartments at the White
Hart. Delay not, Piozzi. I will follow. Do I see my Burney in good
health?"</p>
<p>I was never so affrighted in my life. The lady, though short,
had such an air of resolution and her eyes shot such lively sparks
of anger hid under a show of good humour that I looked to see Miss
Burney sink at my feet. She also was in a horrid fright if panting
breath and fading cheeks may be trusted. I would now have fled but
she detained me by the hand and presented me to a sweeping curtsey
from Mrs Piozzi. Doubtless she thought my presence would confine
the meeting to the forms of politeness.</p>
<p>Accustomed to courts, I could not consider the lady high-bred,
but her energy and intelligence were overpowering.</p>
<p>"I have not seen you since my return, dear Burney," says she,
"but am glad of this favourable opportunity to ask if what I have
been told is true&mdash; that Baretti was inspired and abetted in
his attack on my marriage by friends I could the least suspect.
Pray emulate my candour. An open enemy is preferable to a stabbing
friend."</p>
<p>"Surely, Madam, before a third person&mdash;" began Miss Burney,
but was interrupted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have learnt to know a witness is very valuable on occasion.
All I require is a plain 'Yes' or 'No.'"</p>
<p>"Then 'No'&mdash;a thousand times 'No,'" cried Miss Burney with
immense spirit. "I know nothing of Baretti&mdash;would know
nothing&mdash;a violent unprincipled man, that frightened myself.
That I disapproved your marriage is known&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And on what impertinent grounds!" Mrs Piozzi was now trembling
with rage &mdash;and as pale as Miss Burney. "Let me tell you,
Madam, that a gentleman of good birth is not to be despised, and
his means of L1200 per annum, though not splendour in comparison
with my own revenue, set him above all mercenary imputation!"</p>
<p>'T was with the greatest effort my companion now clung to her
cautious decorum, for she was palpitating violently as she held to
my arm.</p>
<p>"Madam, money was not in question. A woman who will marry a
foreigner and a Roman Catholic, in both respects her country's foe,
must expect&mdash;"</p>
<p>I looked for an explosion but, as happens when women quarrel,
Mrs Piozzi's humour took the most unexpected turn. She
laughed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ah, Fanny, Fanny, that was the world's voice. Time was you
loved me kindly; but the world you always did and will love
reverentially. Well&mdash; continue!&mdash;'t is worth it. The
world has its prizes to give and I have none now. I did not even
provide a husband for my friend, and your Royals have not been more
successful&mdash;I know not why. The day may come when you yourself
may fall back on a foreigner and Roman Catholic, and, if so, may he
be as good as mine and may you live as happy with him!"</p>
<p>She curtseyed and made to move on. I thought of this later when
Miss Burney married M. D'Arblay, a Frenchman and Roman Catholic. I
wondered then if she recalled this scene and her own strictures.
She bridled with dignity.</p>
<p>"I can scarce imagine Dr Burney's daughter doing the like,
Madam. My tastes are all English. But is it well to prolong this
talk? Our ways of life are now so different&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Truly all is changed&mdash;and you with it. But I was ever a
prophet, Fanny, and I venture to tell you that you have so
overloaded your heart and your wits with caution and fear of the
world's opinion that when you take pen in hand once more you 'll
find it clogged and heavy. 'T will move on stilts instead of the
light heels that danced 'Evelina,' and the ungrateful world will
say, 'There goes a woman that if she had shut her eyes on forms and
opened them on nature had been the glory of her age.' You are too
fearful of the world, Fanny. I flew in its face and found its bark
worse than its bite, and that if you kicked it, it crawled to kiss
your feet. And so now good-bye."</p>
<p>They both curtseyed angrily, and Mrs Piozzi proceeded quickly
down the drive, then suddenly turned and ran back, both hands
outstretched:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Fanny, Fanny, I can't&mdash;" she panted. "It all so rose on me
with the sight of you. My master at the table, and Johnson in his
chair booming out his wisdoms, and Burke, and poor Goldie&mdash;Oh,
the poor dead days&mdash;the sad dead days&mdash;and you a part of
them all; and could I say a word to wound you, no matter what you
did to me! You that were a part of it all&mdash;I felt as if I
would kill it outright if I left you in anger. Can one kill
ghosts?&mdash;they are but ghosts, and yet&mdash;Oh, Fanny!"</p>
<p>She held out her shaking hands. I knew this shockingly
disordered Miss Burney's notions of propriety and that a lady out
of favour with the great world should be seen by me thus familiar
with her, and she at Court. She barely touched the hand.</p>
<p>"It was to the memory of those days your friends looked to keep
you in a becoming path," said she. "Indeed I share your affection
for them, but to remember them thus&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you so?" says the other a little wildly, and drawing back to
dash the tears from her eyes. "Then remember them your way and I
'll remember them mine, and so our paths go east and west: (then
turning to me,) I'm sure I ask your pardon, Ma'am, for what must
appear so declamatory and high-flown. We Welsh folk, like all the
other poor Celts, are allowed romantic flights sometimes to make
sport for the sober English. Farewell, Miss Burney. My! best
compliments and respects attend your father."</p>
<p>She ran off again very quick and tripping. We stood looking
after her till Miss Burney spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The tenderness I had and have for her is not to be expressed
nor compared save with the love of David for Jonathan. How have I
been wounded! Yourself, my dear Miss P., is a witness to her
ungoverned passions. Your delicacy will not prefer to entail the
misery of explanation on me."</p>
<p>I hurriedly disclaimed any wish to pursue the subject, and she
was silent as if revolving the scene. But why should I now hesitate
to own that though all the propriety of speech and silence had been
on Miss Burney's side, my own sympathies were engaged with the poor
lady. I thought a heart that less weighed opinion must have melted
at her appeal to fond memories, gushing warm from a sensibility
that she could not control. Since that interview, when I have heard
Mrs. Piozzi censured I could comprehend the high romantic notion
with which she had entered on her marriage, and the more so, since
I had been credibly informed that Mr Piozzi was in all respects
admirable could he but have had the blessing to be born an
Englishman and Protestant.</p>
<p>"Dear Miss P., I trust to you to keep this painful meeting a
secret," said my companion. "I know your serious and respectable
character too well to doubt you will draw the veil over the wild
ungoverned temper of one once so honoured."</p>
<p>I promised and reserved my thoughts and we turned back to the
Castle. But the events of this astonishing walk were not yet at an
end. We were nearing the gates of the gardens, when we saw Colonel
and Mrs Digby beneath the trees on the further side. They were not
conversing and the whole width of the path was between them. It
gave rightly or wrongly an air of dissatisfaction, of weariness in
each other's company, that struck me as instantly as it did my
companion, though of course it could be no surprise to see them
where all the Household took their airings when they would. She
drew me sharply behind a tree.</p>
<p>"Miss P.," she said in breathless agitation, "it is not the
least of my sufferings here that I know it is supposed they are
caused by this marriage. I beg you would not deny it (for I would
have spoken)&mdash;it is too palpable that this is believed. Yet
you are wrong&mdash;completely wrong. Those who have ceased to give
us pleasure very soon lose the power to give us pain; and I view
his marriage with an indifference that wishes him neither well nor
ill. My heart was never engaged. I will not deny that he risked it
and all my peace with it, but he succeeded not. I do not form one
wish to be in her place whom we have just seen. They will have what
happiness they deserve and, if I am not mistaken, I think it will
be little indeed."</p>
<p>She turned and gazed after them with an expression of bitterness
the most concentrated. Never again did I doubt that it was not
wounded love but wounded pride which was driving her from Court
into the retirement of her home. Let others more capable than
myself judge which is the severer pang! She had never regarded him
further than as he had flattered her vanity as woman and genius,
and a burning resentment at the public slight was all that needed
commiseration.</p>
<p>She added composedly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your kindness deserved this explanation and will accept it.
There is no man on earth so indifferent to me as Colonel Digby, and
later events will prove to you that I speak the truth."</p>
<p>I said I could but rejoice to hear it, and we returned from
these agitations to her room.</p>
<p>All this confirmed the opinion I held that she was naturally a
person of agreeable disposition but spoiled by her literary
success. I never doubted that her acceptance of Court office was
with a view to a brilliant establishment such as she had given her
own "Evelina." She was as much her own heroine and hoped for as
romantic advancement, very sensibly preferring a social triumph,
could it be secured, to a mere literary one, which she always took
a little doubtfully as somewhat that might be disparaged.
Disappointed, and openly disappointed, in this hope by the
heartless behaviour of Colonel Digby, she felt retreat to be
inevitable and also the only hope for a future settlement. Yet had
she been wiser to remain! I have ever been convinced that her taste
for the pen was gone by and that only the narrowness of her means
drove her to it again. At Court she would have been valuable from a
natural caution which received a fresh lesson in this foiled
love-affair. When I add that Mrs Schwellenberg offered her the
reversion of her own place when ill health should cause her
retirement and that I know this would have been confirmed, it will
be seen what she most imprudently sacrificed to sentiment.</p>
<p>It will be objected that marriage was her object. If so, there
were opportunities at Court she could not have elsewhere, and among
the grave clergy who attended, a suitable settlement might have
been found. Miss Burney, as the lady of a Bishop, dispensing a
serious hospitality and amending his Charges to his clergy, would
have been in her right place. I am told that her later manner of
writing was far more suited to Episcopality than to fiction, and
can answer that when reading her "Memoirs" of her father I was
unable to trace the sense through the verbiage, which appears to
confirm this view. But it was not to be, though I believe from the
eagerness with which she ever visited the Royals and took every
opportunity to keep her name in sight, that she regretted her folly
and would have repaired it. But how was it possible for Their
Majesties to assist a needy Frenchman and Roman Catholic?</p>
<p>In her final parting with her Mistress she received much kind
notice, including permission to retain half her emolument as a
pension&mdash;and this after but five years' service!</p>
<p>The sweet Princesses successively pressed her hand at the
parting scene and she quitted the room with her handkerchief at her
eyes and a profound final curtsey. The Princess Royal whispered
aside to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Poor soul, she might have made others happier but for the cruel
wound her heart has received. I cannot&mdash;cannot forgive Colonel
Digby!"</p>
<p>The gay and pretty Princess Elizabeth, much livelier in
disposition, leaned on her sister's shoulder, whispering
also:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I think, sister, that Miss Burney will not always be
inconsolable, for at the trial of Mr Warren Hastings the Duchess of
Ancaster observed that Mr Wyndham was very particular in his
attentions to Miss Burney and that she did by no means
<i>froisser</i> them. And have you not thought that she will
certainly meet him much oftener in town than here?"</p>
<p>I could but smile at the young discerner whose thoughts agreed
so fully with my own. For some time after she would ask me merrily
what news of Mr Wyndham, and I certainly expected it. However that
was not to be, and my expectations were verified next year by Miss
Burney's marriage&mdash;a truly amazing one&mdash;even to M.
D'Arblay, a refugee Frenchman and Roman Catholic!</p>
<p>Would that I could have heard Mrs Thrale-Piozzi's views on this
circumstance!</p>
<p>Here I end. I design these notes as a strong corrective of what
might place the Queen and others of less moment in an unamiable
light. Let it be remembered that Miss Burney was the spoiled child
of genius, who would still be first and who throbbingly aspired to
a social eminence denied her. She received all attentions from the
Royal Family as her due, and knew not how to draw the distinction
between what was due to her own merit and what was given by these
personages as due to their <i>own</i> high standard of courtesy and
compassion. This is a distinction seldom drawn by those unused to
high circles and a mere literary society cannot teach it.</p>
<p>I have often desired that I could have had the honour to be
admitted to Her Majesty's private thoughts on Miss Burney, and
should not be wholly surprised if they favoured my own.</p>
<p>No doubt allowance may be made for the vagaries of genius, but
none the less do I rejoice that this, my first meeting with
uncommon talent, was also the last. It is entirely out of place in
courts, and certainly a happy mediocrity is the soil in which
flourish the domestic virtues.</p>
<p>Though I defend not Colonel Digby it is possible he showed his
judgment if not his delicacy in his retreat, it being very
difficult for him or any man to preserve in Miss Burney's company
that sense of superiority which is so essential to matrimonial
peace. There was that in her eye which, if suddenly surprised,
indicated satire; there was that in her demeanour which hinted
depths which might or might not be soothing. To be candid, what we
do not understand is feared rather than loved. And it is to the
author of "Evelina" I owe this conviction.</p>
<p>Peace be with her manes when what I have so doubtfully written
shall be read!</p>

<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>VII. THE DARCYS OF ROSINGS</h2>
<h4>Elizabeth Bennet<br>
Mrs. Darcy</h4>
<p>"I must confess," observed Jane Austen, when Elizabeth Bennet,
who had been created in 1796, was at last introduced to the world
of readers in 1812, "I must confess that I think her as delightful
a creature as ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to
tolerate those who do not like <i>her</i> at least, I do not
know."</p>
<p>Miss Austen had the whimsical habit of diverting herself, when
visiting portrait galleries, by looking for faces that resembled
those of her heroines. She was continually on the watch for
Elizabeth, but never came upon her. She found Mrs. Bingley, "in a
white gown with green ornaments," but not Mrs. Darcy herself. "I
daresay Mrs. D. will be in yellow."</p>
<p>The exhibition in Spring Gardens promised well, but no Elizabeth
appeared. "We have been both to the exhibition and to Sir Joshua
Reynolds's, and I am disappointed, for there was nothing like Mrs.
D. at either. I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes any picture of
her too much to like it should be exposed to the public eye. I can
imagine he would have that sort of feeling&mdash;that mixture of
love, pride, and delicacy."</p>
<p>We could wish that Miss Austen had found the portrait; but since
she never did, there is none of Mrs. Darcy in this book.</p>
<hr>
<p>[<i>A reintroduction to some of the characters of Miss Austen's
novels</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Whitethorn Manor</i>, HUNSDON, KENT.<br>
4th <i>May</i>, 1814.</p>
<p>You will be interested to learn, my dear Sophia, that we are
arrived at our new home a se'nnight since, having posted from
London with every comfort. Already I feel sure we shall not regret
fixing here. Now that the Admiral has retired from the naval
service, a rural retreat was his object, and we had a strong
recommendation to Hunsdon from Mrs Colonel Brandon, the Marianne
Dashwood of your early days and mine. She spoke of the little
domain named as above, and investigation soon convinced my dear
Admiral that this was what he had hoped to secure. My approbation
followed as a matter of course, and I hope an early visit will
convince me of Sophia's. If a fair dawn promises a cloudless day,
we may look forward with the highest degree of confidence
permissible in human affairs.</p>
<p>The journey from London to the village of Hunsdon is agreeable,
and through an affluence of English scenery which must surely
compare favourably with any in the world: swelling hills embowered
in green; placid rivers enlivened by a delightful concert of
feathered songsters; villages clustered about the churchyards,
where sleep their rude forefathers; though it were to be desired
that a judicious restoration could obliterate the savage Norman and
Gothic architecture too often found in the churches, and that they
could be restored in harmony with the more elegant taste of the
present day. I could never agree with Mr Walpole's love of the
Gothic! Still, I am not to deny that the perspective is sometimes
pleasing, and the intention of a ruder age merits respect.</p>
<p>The Admiral, who is not an amateur of scenery, slumbered most of
the way. We alighted from the post-chaise at Sundale for a night's
rest, and ordered a light repast, with tea for me, and that heady
ale which I could wish my Admiral would renounce, both on account
of his increasing weight and his tendency to inflammatory gout. But
you are not now to learn that it is vain to remonstrate with
gentlemen where the pleasures of the table are concerned. Our rooms
being unprepared, we sat downstairs, though the inn was full in
anticipation of some horse races tomorrow, and some of the
gentlemen decidedly in liquor. My attention was early engaged by a
lady of prettyish appearance at a table near by, whose bonnet and
spencer bespoke a florid taste hardly in keeping with her uncurled
ringlets and&mdash;dare I add it&mdash;unwashed hands. She was
accompanied by a good-looking man in regimentals, of handsome but,
as I thought, somewhat dissolute presence (so different from the
solid worth of my Admiral!), who was evidently an officer from
Chatham, not far distant. I judged them to be husband and wife from
their pawning inattention to each other's remarks. Finally, the
gentleman, rousing himself, said in a low clear tone:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It signifies not, Mrs Wickham, what your opinion may be, for
the thing must be done. Money we must have, and your sister's
influence with Mr Darcy is our only prospect of relief. Your father
will do no more. Mr Darcy's prejudice against me is fixed, and
therefore your journey to Hunsdon, now they are staying at Rosings,
will be necessary. Argue no more. My mind is made up."</p>
<p>She pouted angrily.</p>
<p>"I am quite as sensible as you are, Wickham, of our need of
money; but you know how I hate travelling alone, with all the men
ogling me and the servants looking for vails that I have it not to
give. Come with me, and all will be well." Her tone was
cajoling.</p>
<p>"Oblige me with the letter you received from Mrs Darcy a week
since," was his only reply.</p>
<p>She pulled out a dog's-eared letter from her reticule, and he
read aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I regret, my dear Lydia, to be obliged to speak plainly and
say that the less Mr Darcy meets Mr Wickham the more likely is his
benevolence to continue.' Now, Mrs Wickham, in view of that
statement, where is the sense in urging me to accompany you to
Rosings?"</p>
<p>He threw it back to her, and leaned in his chair, staring at his
boots with a very discontented expression. I am no eavesdropper,
Sophia, but the Admiral was still engaged with his plate, and I
could not withdraw; and though I looked pointedly at the lady, she
took no notice.</p>
<p>"It would show more consideration for me, Wickham, if you was to
come. You know how poor my nerves are, and the flutterations I
suffer from at the thought of seeing Darcy. Such a stiff, starched
man&mdash;I don't know how Elizabeth endures him. And the last time
I stayed at Pemberley, the airs of her maid sunk my spirits
altogether. I have not a gown equal to her black silk. The miseries
our marriage has brought upon me&mdash;Good God! what a fool I
was!"</p>
<p>"It was certainly not forced upon <i>you</i>, Madam, whatever it
might be on me."</p>
<p>"A pleasant allusion, I must say," said Mrs Wickham, tossing her
ringlets; then, beginning to giggle: "But you was always a quiz,
Wickham, and don't mean the half you say. You know how I hate
travelling alone, whereas you and me could pick up some friends on
the way, and have a hand at cards. Don't drink no more now. You
will want your head clear for the races. Did you ever see such a
scare as that bonnet yonder?"</p>
<p>There wag no mistaking who she meant, my dear Sophia; and though
it is true I had on my beaver bonnet and blue veil, a little
disordered by the wind, still there was no excuse for her
unladylike freedom. I felt my complexion heighten indignantly. Mr
Wickham took no notice.</p>
<p>"I wish to heaven," he said gloomily, "that I could perform if
it were the most trifling service to Darcy, to lessen this load of
obligation. There are times&mdash;" But his lady was giggling, and
waving her hand to a lady at some distance, and, rising, he strode
away.</p>
<p>But what was I to think? For I had been informed by Marianne
Brandon that Mr and Mrs Darcy are the chief residents at Hunsdon,
where he inherited the noble estate of Rosings from his aunt, the
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, whose daughter and heiress died. Mrs
Darcy was formerly a Miss Elizabeth Bennet, and this sister, Mrs
Wickham, had been of by no means irreproachable conduct. And this
was she! Such impropriety of demeanour! Such a vulgar insipidity!
If Mrs Darcy in any way resembled her, I feared our hope of
pleasant society was destined to disappointment. Such
connections!</p>
<p>I broke the matter with my dear Sir Charles; but he pooh-poohed
my anxieties in his sailorly fashion, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There's many a bad egg from a good nest, my Lady, and Mrs Darcy
may be a valuable woman, for all her sister looks such a slut. And
I would have you by no means be cackling about this meeting all
over the neighbourhood."</p>
<p>Cackling! But you, my dear Sophia, know the energy with which
the Admiral expresses himself. It was his mode of recommending
discretion.</p>
<p>Next morning we started, and saw them no more; but I understood
from the remark of one waiter to another that Mr Wickham was a
well-known figure in the betting ring, and the races would engage
their stay.</p>
<p>As our chaise and four rolled into Hunsdon, my spirits were
elevated by the beauty of the prospect, where a flourishing
peasantry dwells in prosperity under the protection of the worthy
Darcy. The cottages, with their rose-decked gardens and beehives,
the rich pastures, with grazing cattle and dotted with sheep, all
expressed the idea of pastoral plenty; and the handsome carriages
and curricles passing gave us a high opinion of the consequence of
the neighbourhood. I roused the Admiral to partake my pleasure, as
we passed a beautiful little church with a handsome portico in the
Italian taste. We next drove by the Parsonage, standing in a green
lane and faced by the park palings of Rosings; and as we passed I
observed a sensible-looking lady at the window, whom I judged to be
Mrs Collins. The Rector, a tall heavy-featured man, tying up his
carnations, hastened at once to the gate, and by low bows, repeated
until we were out of sight, gave us our first welcome to Hunsdon. I
would have prevailed on the Admiral to stop in response to so much
civility; but he refused, and putting his head out of the window,
desired John to drive on. I could only hope Mr Collins did not hear
him.</p>
<p>How shall I describe, my dear Sophia, the gratification with
which I beheld our new home! It is a long, low, white house,
covered with roses and clematis, with pleasant windows opening to
smooth green lawns, and an air of purity and order within which is
peculiar to English homes. Having travelled to Boulogne, I may be
allowed to be a judge. The rows of curtseying servants, headed by
good Mrs Williams, the housekeeper, and the Admiral's faithful
butler, Sampson, gave us a rude but honest welcome, and were
ordered a couple of bottles of port to drink our healths.</p>
<p>Next day Mr and Mrs Collins waited upon us. She strikes me as a
woman of judgment, much inclined to reserve, and with a demure and
settled manner; but this, in her position, may be very necessary.
The Rector&mdash;what shall I say? This was his
greeting:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is with profound pleasure I have the honour to welcome Sir
Charles Sefton and your Ladyship to your magnificent abode in our
humble village of Hunsdon. We are indeed honoured by the choice of
newcomers so distinguished, to whom the highest circles of London
or the amenities of the world are alike open. But the refined and
elegant society of this neighbourhood will be found worthy of even
such a mark of approbation. Mrs Collins shares my sense of the
distinction thus conferred upon us, and I speak for her as well as
myself."</p>
<p>She looked somewhat uncomfortable at this exuberance,
accompanied with a formal bow for every comma, but is probably used
to it, for she quietly made me a sensible little speech of welcome,
to which I responded in kind.</p>
<p>"I thank you, Sir," replied my Admiral bluntly; "and you will
find us regular attendants at Divine Service, where we hope to
benefit by your discourses, which I hope excel in quality rather
than quantity. Ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"My discourses, Sir Charles, never exceed half an hour, that
being the length preferred by the Right Honorable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, who presented me to this parish; and though she is now
elevated to a sphere higher even than that which she adorned on
earth, I still observe her wishes, and the rather that I have not
had any intimation to the contrary from Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, her
nephew, or his amiable lady, to whom I have the honour to be
related."</p>
<p>"Indeed?" I said; "I was not aware. Do Mr and Mrs Darcy always
reside here?"</p>
<p>"They divide the year between Rosings and Pemberley in
Derbyshire, your Ladyship. But their daughters, the Misses Darcy,
prefer Rosings, so they are oftener here. And I am frequently in
the habit of saying to Mrs Darcy that when these fair flowers are
transplanted to Pemberley, the gardens of Rosings droop and wither.
Elegant females are very susceptible to these little attentions, as
you are aware, and I never hesitate to offer them."</p>
<p>"Flummery and females!" interjected the Admiral. "I hope, Sir,
it is not your intention to spoil my Lady Sefton's digestion with
this sort of whipped cream!"</p>
<p>Mr Collins bowed and sidled, and Mrs C. observed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Misses Darcy are two extremely handsome young
women&mdash;sixteen and fifteen respectively. Miss Darcy is most
prepossessing. I feel sure your Ladyship will agree with me."</p>
<p>"Don't omit the Admiral, Mrs Collins!" said Sir Charles. "I like
a pretty face as well as anyone, as you may judge by my Lady."</p>
<p>The dear man! He expresses himself with bluntness occasionally,
but the heart is gold!</p>
<p>"Are you as good a judge of pigs as of ladies, Mr Collins?" he
added; "for if so, pray accompany me on my first visit to my
pigsties, and we will leave the ladies to their gossip."</p>
<p>Mr Collins went, with a rueful glance at his boots, but bowing
and smiling all the way. I learnt much of the neighbourhood from
Mrs Collins, but with the warm colouring she judged amiable. I must
except, however, the poor of the parish. There she spoke, with a
censure no doubt deserved, of thriftlessness and ingratitude. These
indeed are tokens of a spirit of discontent which we cannot view
with composure, especially in the light of late events in the
unhappy country of France&mdash;the prey of impiety and
revolution.</p>
<p>The visit was, on the whole, pleasant, though Mr Collins's
courtesy is overstrained, and the Admiral, throwing himself into
his chair when they departed, made use of language which, however
suitable for gentlemen, the female pen declines to record,
adding:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When Mr Collins's foot slipped, and he fell prone in the muck,
he got up and apologised until I fairly ran for it."</p>
<p>Next day Mr and Mrs Darcy waited upon us, having thoughtfully
sent a mounted messenger to enquire if we felt equal to receiving
company after our journey. On our agreeing, they presented
themselves in the most unostentatious way, having walked through
their park and down the lane, though the weather was showery. All
forebodings were instantly banished.</p>
<p>Mr Darcy is a tall well-formed man, in early middle life,
distinguished in bearing and manners, a little haughty, but not
more so than is becoming in his position. Mrs Darcy, some years
younger, is veritably charming. You know, my dear Sophia, that I am
not rash and do not use such words unguardedly. She smiled,
disclosing beautiful teeth, and, as I observed, has the peculiar
grace of one whose eyes smile in harmony with her lips. Nothing
could be more obliging than her manners, and I could scarce think
it possible that the tawdry, noisy Mrs Wickham could be her sister.
Her eyes are dark and animated, with long eyelashes which soften
their somewhat alarming brilliance. She is extremely
conversible.</p>
<p>"I am glad you were pleased with the village, Lady Sefton. What
did you think of the church? The old one was a venerable structure,
dating from the Plantagenet kings, and I personally should have
preferred that; but Sir Lewis de Bourgh, who had made the grand
tour with Mr Horace Walpole and other notable amateurs, had
acquired a passion for Italy, and when restoring the church,
Italianised it. Had he also presented us with Naples, where the
original stands, the gift would have been complete; but to my mind
it stands as ill in little Hunsdon as would the dress of an Italian
Signora on good Mrs Collins."</p>
<p>She smiled so archly that I laughed, and the Admiral joined
in.</p>
<p>"Quite right, my dear Madam," he exclaimed. "There can be no
greater folly than sticking the buildings of one country in the
surroundings of another. What the English builders built is good
enough for English men and women, and more suitable than any Greek
and Roman temples and such idle gazebos. They will be having Divine
Worship in a Belvedere next!"</p>
<p>I blushed for my dear Admiral's taste, but was unable to check
his loud voice. Mrs Darcy applauded with her gloved hands, and
sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>"I make a point of applauding any judgment which agrees with my
own," she said playfully; "and I congratulate you, my dear Sir, on
an excellent taste, and vigour in expressing it. I foresee we shall
be always applauding one another. Am I not fortunate in our new
neighbours, my dear Darcy?"</p>
<p>He agreed, with the utmost kindliness and a graceful touch of
formality, and requested permission to examine the exquisite set of
ivory chessmen presented to the Admiral at Bombay. They are a
superb work of art, all the pieces being mounted on elephants,
camels, and horses, elegantly carved. Having bestowed his meed of
admiration, he added:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Since you are acquainted with India, Sir Charles, it will give
me the utmost pleasure if you and her Ladyship will do me the
honour to inspect those which Mr Lorenzo Darcy, my uncle, brought
from that wonderful country. The Ivory Shrine is considered a
masterpiece, and some have recommended that it should be in some
public collection. But family associations&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Public collections!" interrupted the Admiral (I could wish,
Sophia, that the dear man would not interrupt when persons of
consideration are speaking). "They are an encroachment by the lower
orders, on all accounts to be resisted. What? Are private treasures
to be exhibited to their pawings and ignorance? No, Mr Darcy!
Preserve the Ivory Shrine as an heirloom, and let those who would
engage the votes of the vulgar be&mdash;"</p>
<p>I will not record the end of the sentence. Mrs Darcy apologised
for her daughters not waiting upon me by mentioning that they had a
prior engagement with Mrs Collins, relative to a treat for the
village school in honour of Mr Darcy's natal day.</p>
<p>"I bespeak your kindness for them, my dear Madam," she was
pleased to say. "My elder, Charlotte, has a strong taste for
sketching and music, in both of which I am aware you excel. Rumour,
as you see, has preceded you with her trumpet! Caroline is more
studious. We hope, when your son is here on leave, that many little
pleasure parties and balls may be made up. My young people and all
those of the neighbourhood are excessively fond of dancing."</p>
<p>I protested this was a taste my Henry shared, and was very
sensible of her attention. Indeed, Sophia, I trust you will not set
me down as a Mrs Busybody (a character I detest) if I say that
certain possibilities flashed across my mind at the moment. No
young man can be more attractive nor stronger in moral principle
than Henry, and if these young women&mdash;But I need say no more!
Miss Darcy is so great an heiress as to be an object to many.</p>
<p>"You have met Mr Collins as well as his wife, I conclude?" she
added smiling.</p>
<p>"We have had that distinction!" I said, and could not forbear
smiling also.</p>
<p>"A worthy man! But there are peculiarities of manner. His
discourses are always adapted to the occasion, and his
allusions&mdash;He will, no doubt, tomorrow refer to your arrival
in his sermon."</p>
<p>"My dear Mrs Darcy," said I, much alarmed, "have you any real
reason to suppose this? I have never been the object of public
comment. And the Admiral! I trust you are mistaken."</p>
<p>"I may be," she replied archly; "but can only say that the
Sunday after we settled at Rosings, Mr Collins preached from the
text, 'Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah,' and made it very clear that Mr Darcy was that
individual."</p>
<p>I could only gaze at her in dismay, but was obliged to check my
impulse of consulting the Admiral, lest he should take some
compromising step as regards Mr Collins, who might be entirely
innocent of such an intention.</p>
<p>When our visitors rose to take leave, and Sir Charles and I
attended them to the gate, I felt a friendship was commenced which
might have the happiest results for both families. At the gate we
were joined by the young ladies, who had walked up the lane from
the Parsonage, and the introductions were made. They curtseyed with
the prettiest air of good breeding. Charlotte, the elder, is a
glowing brunette. Her purity of expression and correct features
positively charmed me. The younger, not so unusual in beauty, is
still extremely attractive, and has her mother's penetrating and
sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>The next day brought us a visit from my old friend, Marianne
Brandon, who settled here with her Colonel Brandon after Delaford
was sold to Mr Edward Ferrars on his second marriage. Her chief
inducement at Delaford being thus removed by the death of her
sister, Mrs Edward Ferrars, they decided to fix nearer London.</p>
<p>I need not describe to you, who know her, the warmth of her
greeting. Her feelings are always strong and strongly
expressed.</p>
<p>"It adds delight to delight itself," she cried, embracing me,
"that you should be settled here, my dear Anne. What happy days are
in store for us! With our pencils we will seek the beech woods of
White-thorn, and transcribe the various moods of nature."</p>
<p>"Beechmast," said the Admiral, "is one of the most fattening
things I know for swine, and if you will not object to their
presence, Mrs Brandon, I doubt not they will allow of yours. What
say you, Colonel Brandon?"</p>
<p>Their old friendship makes this permissible, however unromantic,
and he has always rallied her thus. She continued with
ardour:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I look forward to the most delightful <i>al fresco</i> meals in
the green shades. We will make up little parties to recline on the
moss&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In that case, my dear, I fear I must ask you to leave me out!"
said dear Colonel Brandon, smiling mischievously. "You forget my
rheumatism and flannel waistcoats!"</p>
<p>She bit her lip. It is a point on which she is sensitive, for
she would not have him thought much older than she, though there is
twenty years' disparity.</p>
<p>"Let us leave them to their own dullness, my dear Marianne, and
tell me all your news," said I.</p>
<p>She drew her chair to mine and talked with all her old
animation. Pity they have no children! Her excellent qualities and
his deserve repetition. One of her items, I own, surprised me. They
are expecting a visit in August from&mdash;whom do you think? You
cannot guess, nor could I. Young Willoughby, now twenty-one years
old, son of her ancient flame, John Willoughby! She speaks of him
now without any consciousness, and there is evidently no painful
feeling. Spending his wife's large fortune, Mr Willoughby, senior,
on her death accepted an appointment at Calcutta, where he has
since resided. This is his only son, landed in England after the
Cape voyage, and he has written them with a very proper letter of
introduction, begging that the young man may present himself and
bespeaking the patronage and civility for him of Colonel and Mrs
Brandon. Her kindly heart gives her a peculiar pleasure in this
opportunity, for you will remember Mr Willoughby, senior, made
explanations which removed much of the seeming heartlessness of his
treatment of her. I might be mistaken in supposing that Colonel
Brandon was less eager for the visit; but such was my impression.
He is not impulsive as she. Their visit was in all respects a
delightful one.</p>
<p>We attended Divine Service next day, and naturally there was a
little curiosity, especially among the white-headed village
children, as we approached our pew, a handsome enclosure with
armchairs, which I feared but too truly would soon invite Sir
Charles to the arms of Morpheus. I think, Sophia, it were to be
desired that there should be a certain rigour in the design of
church furniture. I myself sometimes&mdash;but today my senses were
on the alert, especially when Mr Collins ascended the pulpit, and
pompously announced his text: "A mighty man of valour."</p>
<p>The beginning was harmless, and my thoughts became a little
indistinct, when suddenly I was aware that the allusion was to the
Admiral, and to his services in our actions with the French.
Special allusion was made to his victory in the Arrogant off
Ushant! I sat in such apprehension as cannot be expressed in words.
You are as well aware as I that the modesty of a hero will admit of
no encomiums, and the prayer formed itself on my lips (I hope
without impiety) that his sleep might continue, as I could not be
answerable for the consequences. I sat on tenterhooks, and
meanwhile the Admiral slumbered placidly, his gentle snores
punctuating Mr Collins's discourse, his mouth open, nor dared I
push him with my foot as is my custom. Fortunate indeed was I that
the height of the pew prevented my catching Mrs Darcy's eye. I
cannot but think all this was in deplorable taste. What think you?
As we left the sacred building, the Admiral said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"An excellent discourse! I know not when I have heard a better.
Pointed and instructive. I shall offer a word of commendation to
his Reverence."</p>
<p>I could but look at him with an imploring eye as Mr Collins
bowed.</p>
<p>"I am happy, Sir Charles," he rejoined, after the encomium, "to
have met with your approbation. Ensamples of heroism may surely as
justly be drawn from modern instances as from Alexander and Caesar,
and I am not now to be informed that such ensamples are of more
interest to the infant mind when the illustrious model is seated
among them in all the majesty of success and honour."</p>
<p>The Admiral stared, but Mrs Darcy, joining us, staved off the
disclosure.</p>
<p>"I told you so!" she whispered in my ear, her eyes dancing with
humour.</p>
<p>I pressed her hand for silence and it blew over, the Admiral
later demanding jealously: "What was it all about, my Lady?" when I
replied with a show of countenance: "A droll allusion of Mrs
Darcy's, my dear." So it ended.</p>
<p>So also must this letter, my dear Sophia; but I do not apologise
for its length, knowing your interest in all that touches us. Your
truly aff'e sister,</p>
<p>ANNE SEFTON.</p>
<hr>
<p>4th <i>September</i>, 1814.</p>
<p>I resume my pen, my dear Sophia, to narrate the most
extraordinary series of incidents which can have ever taken place
in such surroundings. You may have seen some reports in the public
journals, but cannot have heard the details. Let me strive to
impart my news in as collected a manner as they merit.</p>
<p>I should premise that my Henry arrived on his leave, and the
very day after received cordial invitations from Mr and Mrs Darcy
to wait on them and join in all the parties of pleasure consequent
on young Willoughby's arrival. A number of friendly gatherings took
place, and Captains Gilbert and Ord from the Chatham garrison were
visitors at Rosings. Still, I ventured to hope that though thus
besieged, the lovely Charlotte did sometimes cast an eye on Henry,
though Willoughby was ever at her side. An invitation to inspect
the Indian rarities followed later, and we drove in my pony
carriage to Rosings, and were received with all Mrs Darcy's
obligingness. She was attended by her two daughters, and I observed
Charlotte's complexion heighten in the most interesting manner as
Henry made his compliments, though young Willoughby was by her
side, and very much at his ease. The young man is extremely
handsome&mdash;very brown-complexioned and with piercing eyes, of a
good height and person. His manners I thought a little disposed to
be familiar; but from the beginning of the acquaintance, I had set
this down to the account of an Indian life and its freedoms. He
remained fixed to Miss Darcy's chair, a manoeuvre I could not see
with comfort. Elegant refreshments&mdash;cold meat, fruit,
etc.&mdash;were immediately served, the Collinses being present and
the Brandons arriving later.</p>
<p>When all had been refreshed, Mr. Darcy led the way to the
library, and the curiosities were produced. The Admiral was in his
element, and young Willoughby was called on for explanations which
he gave well enough. At last the famous Ivory Shrine was removed
from its glass case, and set upon a round table where all could
view it.</p>
<p>I must now be particular in my description. It was a cabinet of
the richest ivory, carved with images of idols whose histories I
know not.</p>
<p>"The thinking mind," said Mr Collins, "must lament to see such
skill lavished on such a worthless subject, were it not the happy
destiny of this cabinet to become an appanage of the great. In the
magnificent mansions of our nobles (titled and untitled) such
objects afford the instructive contrast of an inferior civilisation
with all that is Christian and elegant."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy slightly bowed. He then threw open the doors of the
cabinet, disclosing a surprising object indeed&mdash;a seated
figure of clumsy proportions with the head of an elephant, supposed
by these poor heathen to be a god, of whom the name escapes me.
This also was ivory, with a necklace and girdle of small jewels
inset. Mr Darcy applied to young Willoughby, by his side, for
information of the attributes of this strange being, which he gave
with an elegance as much out of the common as his figure, Mr Darcy
following with the story of its acquisition by his uncle, Mr
Lorenzo Darcy. We all drew near to examine the carvings, the
hideousness of the image precluding admiration; and Mrs Brandon was
gratified, as she told me, to find her
<i>protg</i> distinguish himself by his
address.</p>
<p>"We find his company very agreeable," she said aside, to me and
Mrs Darcy. "He. is a young man of parts, and his travels have made
him very conversible. Our servants find his Indian attendant,
Tippoo, an endless source of surprise. He cannot speak a word of
English, and to see him roll his black eyes and gesticulate causes
laughter which penetrates even to our end of the house."</p>
<p>Mrs Darcy enquired if he were a troublesome inmate on account of
caste prejudices; but Marianne assured her that such was not the
case. He was perfectly obliging.</p>
<p>Still, Sophia, I felt one should be on one's guard where
foreigners are concerned. A young man, though of English parentage,
brought up in India and surrounded by wily Orientals, can scarcely
be expected to have the solid principles of an English training. I
am told that attendance on Divine Service is sadly lax among our
wealthy nabobs; that it is even a practice to give entertainments
on the Sabbath, when other than sacred music is performed. What
must be the result on the young mind?</p>
<p>The afternoon ended, as I feared, in Mr Darcy giving Willoughby
an invitation to spend a week at Rosings, that he might assist him
to classify his Indian collection, a proposal to which the young
man instantly agreed. That I thought it imprudent, I must not deny,
unless indeed there were a settled intention as regards Miss Darcy,
since it would throw them so much together, and already they were
more easy than my judgment could approve. I observed Henry's
spirits, like my own, a little sunk at such a distinction, though
to him also the manners of both Miss Darcy's parents were
conciliatory in the extreme. Both have a generosity of disposition
which will suspect no evil. Yet, Sophia, we hear on the highest
authority that the wisdom of the serpent is equally desirable with
that of the dove.</p>
<p>Willoughby now became a guest at Rosings, and the parties of
pleasure were fewer, the young officers from Chatham having left.
The week passed, and the invitation was extended by a few days, the
lists of Indian rarities still being unfinished.</p>
<p>I was seated in the late afternoon at my embroidery frame, when
Mrs Collins was ushered in, so pale, so trembling and overcome,
that I cried without any ceremony, "Good God! what is it?" and fell
back in terror. She sunk into a chair and endeavoured to collect
her spirits, the Admiral hurrying in from the lawn. At length she
spoke, but with difficulty.</p>
<p>"Miss Darcy is fled with Willoughby!" and could utter no
more.</p>
<p>The Admiral hastily fetched a glass of Constantia, and on
partaking, she resumed with more composure. O Sophia, how express
our feelings!</p>
<p>It now appeared that, when Willoughby was summoned to a cold
collation, prepared in view of an afternoon excursion, he could
nowhere be found. Tippoo was called, that he might seek his master,
but to the consternation of all, his scanty possessions were
removed and the room entirely empty; and the servants, hastening to
his master's chamber, found a dressing-case known to stand on his
table disappeared.</p>
<p>Theft was the first suspicion, and Willoughby's presence doubly
desirable. Again they sought, and in vain. Miss Caroline was seated
with her mother, and hearing all this, she rose with a countenance
pale as ashes and trembling in every limb, and cried:&mdash;</p>
<p>"O Mama, where is Charlotte? I saw her last after breakfast in
the shrubbery with Willoughby. The lake&mdash;O God, can it be
possible!"</p>
<p>These fears at once communicated themselves to her parents and,
hastily summoning help, Mr Darcy ran to the lake. The boat was
loose and floating on the water, with an oar beside it, and a coat
of Willoughby's on the bank; instantly the worst was feared and
Tippoo forgotten. The lodge-keeper and his men were summoned with
drags, poor Mrs Darcy on the bank wringing her hands in speechless
affliction.</p>
<p>"Thus," pursued Mrs Collins, "were two valuable hours lost in
dragging the lake, and more might have been the case, owing to the
success of this vile scheming, but that the gamekeeper&mdash;Ward,
you know, Ma'am&mdash;came running up in hot haste. One of his
underlings had seen, hours before, a post-chaise standing in the
road before the north gate, as if awaiting a party, but took no
particular notice at the time. Returning later to the east gate, he
observed the same post-chaise dashing along at full speed, and will
be positive he saw Miss Darcy's face at the window and Willoughby
with her. Such was the speed, that he could say no more than that
the driver was a dark handsome young man in a triple cape. Thinking
it was merely one of the parties of pleasure which had been so
common, he loitered along, resumed his work, and only by a chance
mentioned it to the gamekeeper, who with more presence of mind ran
at once to his master.</p>
<p>"O my dear Lady Sefton," continued Mrs Collins, "What a scene of
horror was here! An elopement! And with a man virtually unknown,
and of whose parent Marianne Dashwood's experience was dreadful!
Pursuit was immediately ordered, and Mr Darcy mounted his horse,
though none can be sure what way they will have taken at the
crossroads. Who&mdash;who could have supposed this of a young lady
so virtuously brought up as Miss Darcy?"</p>
<p>"A sly little jade!" said the Admiral; and actually smiled! Such
are even the best of men!</p>
<p>Scarcely able to articulate for horror, I was able to
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"True, dear Ma'am. Yet must we not own there was imprudence in
permitting a young girl of Miss Darcy's beauty and expectations to
be so unguardedly in the company of Willoughby? Forcibly indeed has
that thought struck me more than once. Poor unfortunate parents!
Let us hasten to condole with them."</p>
<p>Mrs Collins was too overcome to attend us, and the Admiral
giving me his arm, we set off through the Park, he speaking his
mind with the bluffness of a sailor on Miss Darcy's behaviour. Well
did she know, he said, that her parents would never consent to a
match so far below her pretensions, and therefore&mdash;But I dare
not emulate his frankness.</p>
<p>We found Mrs Darcy pale but composed, a mounted messenger having
returned from Mr Darcy with the news that he had heard of a
post-chaise going at full galloping speed on the road to Merton,
and was following it up. He begged Mrs Darcy to sustain her
spirits, and call on the Admiral for aid if occasion should arise
in his absence.</p>
<p>O Sophia, how describe the looks of fear and horror which
surrounded us on all sides in that hitherto so happy household!
Caroline fainted in her mother's arms and was instantly conveyed to
her room, where we attended her until consciousness was restored
and misery with it. The Admiral employed himself in the library, in
questioning the men and women, with a view to discover some more
certain clew to pursuit, or possibly some accomplice, his
experience as president of courts-martial standing him in such good
stead that he terrified them all, and I feel certain, had any been
a party to the flight, it must have been known. So valuable is
manly presence of mind in such emergencies! Nothing, however,
transpired.</p>
<p>Time advanced, and Mrs Darcy requested we would remain. The
shades of night darkened, and still no news. It was impossible not
to admire Mrs Darcy's fortitude, for indeed this must have forcibly
recalled the time when her sister Mrs Wickham (as I have learnt
from Marianne Dashwood) made the fatal elopement with Wickham which
has secured her a lifetime of wretched poverty and uneasiness. I
readily understood her deplorable appearance at the Sundale inn on
hearing her story. Fatal indeed, Sophia, are the steps of female
error, and how impossible to be retrieved!</p>
<p>We are not to judge Providence, yet it certainly appears that
masculine imprudences are viewed more leniently from on high.
Rectitude, no doubt, is demanded from all; but it must be owned the
consequences are less severe when a man forsakes the narrow path of
virtue. As the Admiral frequently observes&mdash;woman is the
weaker vessel and therefore much more is rightly expected from her,
and the punishment justly more severe, as we observe in the case of
Eve and other examples for our learning. This, however, is a
bewildering subject, and more suited to my dear Admiral's
understanding, so I pursue it no further.</p>
<p>We were all unable to eat, and were sitting listless in the
parlour as midnight approached, when my ear caught the gallop of a
horse. "Mr Darcy!" I cried, starting to my feet and trembling with
agitation.</p>
<p>Mrs Darcy, exercising an almost superhuman composure, sat
rigidly in her chair. The door was flung open and in rushed <i>Mr
Wickham</i>&mdash;disordered with speed and riding, but
recognisable to me as the handsome, dissipated-looking man we had
seen at the inn at Sundale. He seized Mrs Darcy's almost lifeless
hand and cried: "Courage, Ma'am! She is safe. She is with Mrs
Wickham at Sundale, and the miscreant fled."</p>
<p>How is it possible, Sophia, that I should describe the scene
that ensued?</p>
<p>Hearing the commotion, Caroline tottered downstairs and swooned
again at our feet, yet was scarcely heeded&mdash;all crowding round
Wickham, who obligingly soothed our anxiety.</p>
<p>"When," he said, "the officers of our regiment returned to
Chatham from the enjoyment of Mr Darcy's hospitality, the incidents
of their stay were naturally broached, and Willoughby spoken of.
Nothing, however, transpired until Colonel Vaughan returned from
leave, when the subject happened to come up again. 'But, good God,
who is this?' cried Colonel Vaughan. 'Young Willoughby died eight
months ago at Calcutta, and was an only child. My own brother
attended his obsequies. Who can this person be?' All was
astonishment. His brother, Mr James Vaughan, was hastily summoned
from his residence in the Dockyard, and fully confirmed this, he
having lately returned from India. He looked very gravely upon the
matter, and mentioned that Mr Willoughby, senior, had formed years
ago an illicit connection with a Portuguese female, of which there
were two sons of most disreputable character. I waited not to hear
more, but called for my horse, and in regimentals, as you see me,
rode at full speed for Sundale, where Mrs Wickham was awaiting me
for the Sundale Steeplechase, that being the nearest way here."</p>
<p>Mrs Darcy pressed his hand, but was still unable to speak. He
proceeded:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was now almost dusk and she pressed a little necessary
refreshment on me in the inn parlour. I was swallowing it hastily,
when a post-chaise drew up at the door and a man alighted,
supporting in his arms an almost senseless female, a large veil
concealing her bonnet and face. He called for a private room and
refreshment in a haughty impatient tone, and was turning to the
stair with his burden, when, struggling from his arms, she tottered
toward Mrs. Wickham exclaiming, 'O Aunt Lydia, save me&mdash;save
me!' and dropped at her feet."</p>
<p>A sob broke from Mrs Darcy's pale lips, but still she spoke
not.</p>
<p>"Mrs Wickham removed her veil, and there was Miss Darcy, in a
truly pitiable condition. The baffled villain, little thinking how
he had run into a trap of his own making, stood one second a mask
of terror. I made for him instantly, sword in hand, but he ran with
the speed of lightning through the ostler's yard and was lost in
the beech woods behind. I gave directions for search to be made and
returned to the ladies."</p>
<p>Mrs Darcy lifted his hand in both hers and pressed it to her
lips. "The hand that saved my Charlotte!" was all she could murmur;
and indeed we were all in tears of thankfulness and joy. Mr
Wickham's own manly tones trembled as he resumed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Between the agitations that ensued, the dear girl told us how
he had forced her into the post-chaise and driven off at full
speed, determined so to compromise her that a marriage would be
insisted on, or even besought by her parents. He had sent a decoy
chaise on the Merton road, and driven furiously to Sundale,
counting on the coast being clear. I waited not, however, to hear
more, but left her in Mrs Wickham's arms, and rode on hither."</p>
<p>"Brother, you are weary&mdash;famished!" cried Mrs Darcy, ever
considerate. "Are we to have no thought for you, who have had so
much for us? I knew&mdash;I knew my Charlotte could not so
fearfully be lost to all sense of propriety, and knowing this, can
now recover. Oh, could my Darcy but know his girl is safe!"</p>
<p>O Sophia, what a scene was here&mdash;all pressing refreshments
on our deliverer&mdash;all joyful excitement. The only element
lacking, dear Mr Darcy's presence! And two hours later,&mdash;for
none could go to rest,&mdash;that also was supplied; for finding
his pursuit of the Merton chaise mistaken, he returned home,
drooping and almost despairing, in the faint hope of tidings.</p>
<p>Words sink beneath the effort to describe his manly gratitude to
Wickham, and the relief of hearing he had not been deceived in his
belief in Miss Darcy's principles. Never have I seen his majesty of
demeanour so softened. He also addressed Mr Wickham as "Brother,"
and the latter was profoundly touched. If I mistake not, this will
be an epoch in his career and that of his unhappy wife. Mr Darcy's
is a spirit that will never leave an obligation unacknowledged.
They rode together next day to escort Mrs Wickham and the
interesting victim to Rosings&mdash;Miss Darcy in a pitiable
condition, but yet fully sensible of her safety.</p>
<p>"On such occasions," observed Mr Collins to the Admiral, "it
cannot be denied that a special Providence appears to attend the
great. Had Miss Darcy been a humbler female, had she not been
possessed of relatives willing and able to defend her, what might
not have been dreaded! This leads us to devout admiration of the
discriminating bounties of heaven, so well bestowed where most
needed and deserved. For what, Sir Charles, is the downfall of a
female of low birth, however worthy, compared with that of a young
lady who has adorned elevated circles and is the cynosure of all
eyes and hearts!"</p>
<p>The dear Admiral owned to me later that this exordium so
bewildered him that he knew not "at which end to take hold of it,"
to use his own expression. I feel the difficulty myself.</p>
<p>The public prints will have informed my Sophia that the
miscreant escaped, and that it is now known the pair were brothers,
a dark stain for the complexion having converted the younger into
the attendant, for the visit to Hunsdon. Reassuming his own
appearance, he acted as the driver and was of course wholly in his
brother's interest in securing a wealthy prize in Miss Darcy. What
machinations, and what a deliverance!</p>
<p>Mrs Darcy, who is all candour, said later to me that she had
suspected the beginning of an attachment in my Henry's mind, and
that, if it were so&mdash; Here she hesitated in the most
interesting manner.</p>
<p>I took her hand in mine. "Hesitate not to open the subject, my
dear Ma'am," said I, "for I can confirm your view. Henry is deeply,
deeply interested in your sweet girl&mdash;poor lovely innocent!
And if there is any hope&mdash;"</p>
<p>It was my turn to hesitate. She resumed more calmly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Then, if it be so, Lady Sefton, I may speak plainly. Candour is
a necessity of Mr Darcy's character and mine. I cannot deny that
Charlotte's imagination was touched, however slightly, by
Willoughby's romantic tales and appearance. Young minds are
susceptible&mdash;"</p>
<p>Indeed, Sophia, there was a false glitter about him which I, for
one, instantly distrusted; but the inexperience of the young will
ever be a danger. I said as much and she continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Calm recollection and these frightful events have, however,
wrought a complete cure and a revulsion of feeling which has turned
her mind to Mr Sefton's worth with full appreciation. If
later&mdash;<i>much</i> later&mdash;he should make an application,
I believe he might hope for a success which I venture not to
promise. Her parents are also to blame for incaution. But the
future may yet be all brightness."</p>
<p>As for Henry, his affection is unaltered, and perhaps deepened,
by these occurrences. And it has impressed me, Sophia, that
possibly Mr and Mrs Darcy might have had more exalted aspirations
for their lovely heiress than a mere baronet's son had not this
shade fallen on her opening flower. I think it is the Swan of Avon
who observes that there is a soul of goodness in things evil, and
so it may have proved in this instance.</p>
<p>As to Marianne Brandon, the whole affair has cost her a severe
illness, in which she incessantly deplored her own impulsive
nature, though all did their utmost to mitigate the blow. "Shall I
never acquire the calm judgment and sober reason which alone can
preserve from such errors?" was her cry. "Surely I, who have so
much reason to distrust the name of Willoughby, should have
hesitated to introduce one of that fatal race to the notice of
friends."</p>
<p>I fear she will never forgive herself; but it may prove a
warning to a being whose only fault is incaution, and a too warm
belief in human nature. The Colonel is, and will be, her unfailing
support.</p>
<p>Although nothing definite has yet been said, the Admiral is now
inspecting Hoddesden House, with a view to our young couple's
occupation, and I hope ere long to send you the joyful news of the
addition of a daughter to my comforts.</p>
<p>I should not conclude without dwelling on the danger of
insufficient introductions; and something might also be said of the
impiety of admitting false gods to adorn a Christian library, even
as objects of art. But my Sophia is well able to draw her own
conclusions and her affectionate sister will now, with all good
wishes and endearing thoughts, conclude.</p>
