  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">THE dusty overland train pulled into Wagontongue about noon
  of a sultry June day. The dead station appeared slow in coming to life.
  Mexicans lounging in the shade of the platform did not move.</p>

  <p>Trueman Rock slowly stepped down from the coach, grip in hand, with an
  eager and curious expression upon his lean dark face. He wore a plain check
  suit, rather wrinkled, and a big gray sombrero that had seen service. His
  step, his lithe shape, proclaimed him to be a rider. A sharp eye might have
  detected the bulge of a gun worn under his coat, high over his left hip and
  far back.</p>

  <p>He had the look of a man who expected to see some one he knew. There was
  an easy, careless, yet guarded air about him. He walked down the platform,
  passing stationmen and others now moving about, without meeting anyone who
  took more than a casual glance at him. Then two young women came out of the
  waiting-room, and they shyly gazed after him. He returned the compliment.</p>

  <p>At the end of the flagstone walk Rock hesitated and halted, as if
  surprised, even startled. Across the wide street stood a block of frame and
  brick buildings, with high weatherbeaten signs. It was a lazy scene. A group
  of cowboys occupied the corner; saddled horses were hitched to a rail;
  buckboards and wagons showed farther down the street; Mexicans in colorful
  garb sat in front of a saloon with painted windows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon the old burg&rsquo;s not changed any,&rdquo; soliloquized
  Rock, with satisfaction. &ldquo;Funny, I expected to find her all built
  up....Let me see. It&rsquo;s five&mdash;six years since I left. Well, I never
  ought to have come back, but I just couldn&rsquo;t help it. Somethin&rsquo;
  roped me in, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Memory stirred to the sight of the familiar corner. He had been in several
  bad gun fights in this town, and the scene of one of them lay before him. The
  warmth and intimacy of old pleasant associations suffered a chill. Rock
  wheeled away and hunted up the baggage-room to inquire about his saddle and
  bag, which he had checked at Deming. They had arrived with him. Reflecting
  that he did not know yet where to have them sent, Rock slipped the checks
  back into his pocket, and went out.</p>

  <p>A subtle change had begun to affect his pleasure in returning to
  Wagontongue. He left the station, giving a wide berth to the street corner
  that had clouded his happy reflections. But he had not walked half a block
  before he came to another saloon, the familiar look of which and the barely
  decipherable name&mdash;Happy Days&mdash;acted like a blow in his face. He
  quickened his step, then reacting to his characteristic spirit, he
  deliberately turned back to enter the saloon. The same place, the same bar,
  stained mirror, and faded paintings, the same pool tables. Except for a
  barkeeper, the room was deserted. Rock asked for a drink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stranger hereabouts, eh?&rdquo; inquired the bartender, pleasantly,
  as he served him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I used to know Wagontongue,&rdquo; replied Rock.
  &ldquo;You been here long?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; on two years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the cattle business?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good, off an&rsquo; on. Of course it&rsquo;s slack now, but
  there&rsquo;s some trade in beef.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beef? You mean on the hoof?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Butcherin&rsquo;. Gage Preston&rsquo;s outfit do a big
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s new,&rdquo; replied Rock, thoughtfully.
  &ldquo;Gage Preston?... Heard his name somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you a puncher or a cattleman, stranger?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I was both,&rdquo; replied Rock, with a laugh. &ldquo;Reckon
  that means I always will be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Several booted men stamped in and lined up before the bar. Rock moved away
  and casually walked around, looking at the bold pictures on the wall. He
  remembered some of them. Also he found what he was unostentatiously
  seeking&mdash;some bullet holes in the wall. Then he went out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I oughtn&rsquo;t have looked at that red liquor,&rdquo; he
  decided.</p>

  <p>There were times when it was bad for Trueman Rock to yield to the bottle.
  This was one of them. The sudden cold in his very marrow, the blank gray
  shade stealing over his mind, the presagement of a spell of morbid sinking of
  spirit&mdash;these usually preceded his rather rare drinking bouts. He had
  not succumbed in a long time now, and he hoped something would happen to
  prevent it in this instance. For if he fell here in Wagontongue, it would be
  very bad. It would be folly and the poorest kind of business. He had been
  industrious and fortunate for some years in a Texas cattle deal, and had sold
  out for ten thousand dollars, which amount of money he carried in cash upon
  his person.</p>

  <p>Rock went to the Range House, a hotel on another corner. It had been
  redecorated, he noticed. He registered, gave the clerk his baggage checks,
  and went to the room assigned him, where he further resisted the mood
  encroaching upon him by shaving and making himself look presentable to his
  exacting eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure would like to run into Amy Wund,&rdquo; he said, falling into
  another reminiscence. &ldquo;Or Polly Ackers. Or Kit Rand.... All married
  long ago, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went downstairs to the lobby, where he encountered a heavy-set,
  ruddy-faced man, no other than Clark, the proprietor, whom he well
  remembered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Rock! Glad to see you,&rdquo; greeted that worthy,
  cordially, if not heartily, extending a hand. &ldquo;I seen your name on the
  book. Couldn&rsquo;t be sure till I&rsquo;d had a peep at you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Bill!&rdquo; returned Rock, as they gripped hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you haven&rsquo;t changed any, if I remember. Fact is you look
  fit, an&rsquo; prosperous, I may say. Let&rsquo;s have a drink for old
  times&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went from the lobby into a saloon that was new and garish to
  Rock&rsquo;s eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine place, Bill. Reckon you&rsquo;ve been some prosperous
  yourself. Do you still run the little game up-stairs that used to keep us
  punchers broke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big game now, Rock,&rdquo; replied the hotel man as
  they tipped their glasses. &ldquo;How long since you left
  Wagontongue?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Six years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, so long as that? Time shore flies. We&rsquo;ve growed some,
  Rock. A good many cattlemen have come in. All the range pretty well stocked
  now. Then the sheep business is growin&rsquo;, in spite of opposition. We
  have two lumber mills, some big stores, a school, an&rsquo; a town
  hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you sure are comin&rsquo; on. I&rsquo;m right glad, Bill.
  Always liked Wagontongue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you jest drop in to say hello to old friends, or do you aim to
  stay?&rdquo; inquired Clark, his speculative eye lighting.</p>

  <p>Rock mused over that query, while Clark studied him. After a moment he
  flipped aside Rock&rsquo;s coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh! Excuse <i>me</i>, Rock, for bein&rsquo; familiar,&rdquo; he
  went on, with slight change of manner. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re
  packin&rsquo; hardware, as usual. But I hope you ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo;
  for some one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon not, Bill. But there might be some one lookin&rsquo; for me.
  ... How&rsquo;s my old friend, Cass Seward?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&mdash;Wal, you needn&rsquo;t be curious aboot Cass
  lookin&rsquo; for you. He&rsquo;s been daid these two years. He was a real
  sheriff, Rock, an&rsquo; a good friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure of that last, but Cass was a good
  fellow all right. Dead! I&rsquo;m sure sorry. What ailed him,
  Bill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. He cashed with his boots on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, that was never cleared up for shore. It happened out here at
  Sandro. Tough place then. But for that matter it still is. Cass got in a row
  an&rsquo; was shot. There was a greaser an&rsquo; a cowpuncher shot up the
  same night, but they didn&rsquo;t croak. The talk has always been that Ash
  Preston killed Seward. But nobody, least of all our new sheriff, ever tried
  to prove it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Ash Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the oldest son of Gage Preston, a new cattleman to these
  parts since you rode here. An Ash is as bad a hombre as ever forked a
  hoss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad? What you mean, Bill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I leave it to you. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; any more,
  an&rsquo; please regard that as confidence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, Bill,&rdquo; replied Rock, hastily. After another drink
  and some casual conversation about the range they parted in the hotel lobby.
  Rock took an instinctive step back toward the saloon door, hesitated, and
  turned away. He was still stubborn about giving in to the desire for liquor.
  He declared to himself that he did not really need or want whisky. It was
  just a need to drive away a mood. He had not calculated that it would hurt to
  come back to Wagontongue. He told himself that there was no reason why it
  should. Suppose he had been in love with Amy Wund, and later with Polly and
  Kit? That had never hurt him, or even prevented him from falling in love with
  Texas girls. He had never been proof against a pretty girl. He sensed a moral
  lapse that would land him good and drunk if something did not counteract it.
  He had always been rather disgusted with this weakness, though he believed it
  was less pronounced in him than in most cowboys. Sitting there in a chair, he
  recalled friends and enemies of the old Wagontongue days. It developed that
  there were many friends and but few enemies. One of his best friends had been
  Sol Winter, a kindly storekeeper who always overrated a service Rock had once
  rendered. Whenever Rock got into a scrape, provided it was not a shooting
  one, Sol was the one who helped him out of it. And as for money, Sol had
  always been his bank. Rock, remembering many things now clear, one of which
  was that he had left Wagontongue hastily and penniless, thought he recalled a
  debt still unpaid. With that he sallied out to find Winter&rsquo;s store.</p>

  <p>It should have been a couple of blocks down the street. Some of the
  buildings were new, however, and Rock could not be sure. Finally he located
  the corner where Sol&rsquo;s place of business had been. A large and
  pretentious store now occupied this site. Rock experienced keen pleasure at
  the evidence of his old friend&rsquo;s prosperity, and he stalked gayly in,
  sure of a warm welcome. But he was only to learn that Sol Winter did not
  occupy this store.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;Is Winter still in business?&rdquo; inquired Rock,
  conscious of disappointment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After a fashion. He has been sort of run out of the best part of
  town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Run out? How?&rdquo; sharply returned Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better store and stock took his trade. If you want anything
  you&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I don&rsquo;t want anythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; interrupted Rock,
  and departed.</p>

  <p>Through inquiry, he located Sol Winter&rsquo;s store at the end of the
  street. It was by no means a small or cheap place, but it was not what it had
  once been. Rock entered. Sol was waiting upon a woman. He looked older,
  thinner, grayer, and there were deep lines in his face that seemed strange to
  Rock. Six years was a long time. Rock gazed round him. It was a large store
  room crowded with merchandise&mdash;hardware, groceries, saddles and harness
  and farm implements.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what can I do for you?&rdquo; inquired a voice at
  Rock&rsquo;s elbow. He turned to find Winter beside him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Sol, old-timer!&rdquo; said Rock, with a warm leap of his
  pulse. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter leaned and crouched a little, his eyes piercing. Suddenly the
  tightness of his face loosened into a convulsive smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True Rock!&rdquo; he shouted, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure as you&rsquo;re born. How are you, Sol?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter seized him with glad hard hands. &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t really
  you!... Why, you ole ridin&rsquo;, drinkin&rsquo;, shootin&rsquo;,
  love-makin&rsquo; son of a gun!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see me, Sol?&rdquo; returned Rock, tingling under
  Winter&rsquo;s grip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad?&mdash;Lordy, there ain&rsquo;t words to tell you. Why, True,
  you were always like my own boy. An&rsquo; since I lost
  him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lost him!&mdash;Who? You never had any boy but Nick. What you
  mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear aboot Nick?&rdquo; queried Winter, with
  jaw quivering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve never heard any news from Wagontongue since I
  left,&rdquo; returned Rock, bracing himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nick was shot off his hoss out near Sunset Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;no! Sol?&mdash;Nick shot! Aw, say he wasn&rsquo;t
  killed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he was, True,&rdquo; replied Winter, sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That fine sweet lad!... My God! I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; exclaimed
  Rock, huskily, as he wrung Winter&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;But it was an
  accident?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So they say, but I never believed it. There&rsquo;s still bad blood
  on the range, True. You must remember. In fact there&rsquo;s some new bad
  blood come in since you left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here a customer entered, and Rock was left to himself for the moment. He
  seated himself on the counter and put aside his sombrero, to find his brow
  clammy and cold. Nick Winter dead! Shot by rustlers, probably, or some enemy
  of Winter&rsquo;s, or perhaps by this new bad element hinted at by Clark and
  Winter. The last thing Rock would have expected was that anyone could do
  violence to gentle, kindly, crippled Nick Winter. Here was something to keep
  Rock around Wagontongue, if nothing else offered. Rock pictured in mind the
  wild range south of Wagontongue and particularly the broken Sunset Pass
  country with its sage flats and cedar ridges and piñoned gorges and the
  purple timber uplands. There had never been a more beautiful wilderness known
  to Rock or one harder on riders, horses, and cattle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, it&rsquo;s good to see you sittin&rsquo; there,&rdquo; said
  Winter, returning to place a hand on Rock&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I never
  saw you look so well, so clean an&rsquo; fine. I don&rsquo;t need to be told
  you&rsquo;ve worked hard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Sol. I&rsquo;ve been five years on a cattle job in Texas.
  Cleaned up ten thousand, all honest and square. I&rsquo;ve got a roll that
  would choke a cow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! Ten thousand? Why, True, that&rsquo;s a small fortune!
  It&rsquo;ll make you. If only you don&rsquo;t get drunk an&rsquo; begin to
  gamble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Sol, maybe I won&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ve gone straight so
  long I&rsquo;m worried.... How much do I owe you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Owe me? Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Sol, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look over your books before I hand you one,&rdquo; ordered Rock,
  fiercely. Whereupon he helped Winter find the old account, which was not
  small, and forced him to accept payment with interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Rock, to be honest, this little windfall will help a
  lot,&rdquo; declared Winter, brightly. &ldquo;I got in a cattle deal some
  time past an&rsquo; lost out pretty much in debt. Then the new
  store&mdash;Dabb&rsquo;s&mdash;ate into my trade. I had to move. Lately,
  though, my business has picked up. Old customers have come back. I think I
  can pull out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Who&rsquo;d you go in cattle deals with?&rdquo;
  rejoined Rock, gruffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb? Not John Dabb who ran things here years ago?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, John Dabb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Sol, you ought to have known better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. But it seemed such a promisin&rsquo; deal, an&rsquo; it was
  for Nick&rsquo;s sake.... But I&rsquo;m out of cattle deals for
  good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on. Tell me some more bad news,&rdquo; said Rock, gloomily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s aboot all, True.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of my old girl, Kit Rand?&rdquo; inquired
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kit. Let me see. I know she married Chess
  Watkins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! That drunken loafer?&rdquo; interrupted Rock,
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; she couldn&rsquo;t change him, either. Kitty had to
  go to work in a restaurant here, an&rsquo; finally they left Wagontongue.
  Never heard of them since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kitty Rand? That dainty, clever little girl a waitress! Good Lord!
  ... How about Polly Ackers? There was a girl who was sure to be a
  success.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Polly went to the bad,&rdquo; returned Sol, gravely. &ldquo;Some
  flash gambler got around her. She&rsquo;s been gone for years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I ever came back to this darned
  Wagontongue.... I&rsquo;ll risk one more question. How about my best girl,
  Amy Wund?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worse an&rsquo; more of it, True,&rdquo; rejoined Winter.
  &ldquo;After you left, Amy played fast an&rsquo; loose with many a puncher.
  There are some who say yet she never got over your runnin&rsquo;
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thunder! They&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; burst out Rock. &ldquo;She
  played fast an&rsquo; loose with <i>me</i>. She never cared two snaps for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she did, if there&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo; in gossip. Mebbe she
  never found it out till you were gone. Amy was a highstrung lass. An&rsquo;
  you know, Rock, you were sweet on Polly at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord forgive me, I was,&rdquo; replied Rock, miserably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys will be boys. I reckon you didn&rsquo;t know your mind any
  better&rsquo;n Amy knew hers. An&rsquo; now brace yourself for a shock,
  True.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fire away, you old Calamity Jane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy broke the hearts of all the cowboys on the
  range&mdash;an&rsquo; then up an&rsquo; married John Dabb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock glared speechlessly at his friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb was a widower with a daughter &rsquo;most as old as Amy. They
  were married a year or so ago. It was a poor match, they say about town. Amy
  is not happy an&rsquo; she flirts as much as ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman Rock dropped his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, it&rsquo;s the way of life,&rdquo; went on Winter.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been gone a long time. An&rsquo; things happen to people,
  most of it sad, I&rsquo;m sorry to say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, will you keep my money till I come askin&rsquo; for it?&rdquo;
  queried Rock, with his hand inside his waistcoat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, True, what&rsquo;re you up to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out and get awful, terrible drunk,&rdquo;
  declared Rock, tragically.</p>

  <p>Winter laughed, though he looked serious enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, True.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am, by gosh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, son. It&rsquo;ll only fetch back the old bad
  habit. You look so fine now, I&rsquo;d hate to see you do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to drown my grief, Sol,&rdquo; declared Rock,
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, wait till I come back,&rdquo; returned Winter.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to the station. My clerk is off today. Keep store
  for me. There&rsquo;s not much chance of any customer comin&rsquo; in at this
  noon hour, but if one does come, you wait on him&mdash;like you used
  to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll keep store. But you rustle back here pronto.
  I tell you I want to get terrible drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter hurried out, bareheaded and in his shirt sleeves, leaving Rock
  sitting on the counter, a prey to symptoms he well knew. This time the still
  small voice of conscience was lacking. He felt the wild, unreasonable,
  sickening yearnings to do himself wrong&mdash;a black shade encroaching upon
  the wholesomeness of his mind. If Sol did not hurry back&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>A light quick step arrested the current of Trueman&rsquo;s thoughts. He
  looked up. A girl had entered the store. His first swift sight of her caused
  him to slip off the counter. She looked around expectantly, and seeing Rock
  she hesitated, then came forward. Rock suddenly realized that to get terribly
  drunk was the very remotest thing that he wanted or intended to do.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Winter in?&rdquo; asked the girl, pausing before the
  counter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He had to go to the station. Reckon he&rsquo;ll be there quite
  some time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait, and I wanted
  him particularly,&rdquo; she said, a little embarrassed and impatient.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I do anythin&rsquo; for you?&rdquo; inquired Rock. He was cool,
  easy, respectful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you the new clerk Mr. Winter was expecting?&rdquo; she
  queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, at your service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve quite a list of things to get,&rdquo; she said, opening
  a handbag to pry into it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, miss. But I&rsquo;m a little new to the
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; she returned,
  graciously. &ldquo;Now where is that paper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The delay gave Trueman opportunity to look at her covertly. She was
  thoroughbred Western, about twenty-one or two, blond, with fair hair more
  silver than gold. She was not robust of build, yet scarcely slender. She wore
  a faded little blue bonnet not of the latest style, and her plain white
  dress, though clean and neat, had seen long service.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she said, producing a slip of paper and looking
  up somewhat flushed. Her eyes were large, wide apart, gray in color. Rock
  looked into them. Something happened to him then that had never happened
  before and which could never happen again. &ldquo;Now, shall I read the list
  off one at a time or altogether?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, miss, it really doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;make any
  difference,&rdquo; replied Trueman, vaguely, gazing at her lips. They were
  sweet and full and red, and just now curved into a little questioning smile.
  But, as he watched, it fled and then they seemed sad. Indeed her whole face
  seemed sad, particularly the deep gray eyes that had begun to regard him
  somewhat doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;the groceries first,&rdquo; she said, consulting
  her list. &ldquo;Five of sugar, five of rice, five&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five what?&rdquo; interrupted Trueman, with alacrity, moving toward
  the grocery department. Everything was in plain sight. It ought to be easy,
  if he could keep his eyes off her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five what!&rdquo; she echoed, in surprise, raising her head.
  &ldquo;Did you think I meant barrels? Five <i>pounds</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; replied Trueman, hastily.
  &ldquo;But some people buy this stuff in bulk. I used to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you were not always a clerk, then?&rdquo; she inquired,
  following him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no! I&rsquo;ve been a&mdash;a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked as if she believed him. Rock began to grasp that he was
  bungling the greatest opportunity of his life. He found the sugar and had
  almost filled a large sack when she checked him: &ldquo;Not brown sugar.
  White, please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was something in her tone that made Rock wonder if she were laughing
  at him. It stirred him to dexterity rather than clumsiness. He filled a large
  paper bag with white sugar, then turned to her, essaying a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t weigh it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never weigh out small amounts,&rdquo; he returned, blandly.
  &ldquo;I can guess very accurately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than five pounds of sugar in that bag,&rdquo;
  she protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably, a little. Sure I never guess underweight.&rdquo; He laid
  the bag on the counter. &ldquo;What next? Oh, the rice.&rdquo; And he dove
  for the bin containing that staple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you guess the weight of rice, too?&rdquo; she inquired, as if
  consumed with curiosity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure can. Even better. It&rsquo;s not near so heavy as
  sugar.&rdquo; And he filled a larger bag. In attempting to pass this to her
  he accidentally touched her bare hand with his. The soft contact shot a
  thrilling current through him. He dropped the bag. It burst, and the rice
  poured all over her, and like a white stream to the floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; she said, aghast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, miss. I&rsquo;m sure awkward this day. But rice is
  lucky. That might be a good omen. I&rsquo;m superstitious,&rdquo; went on
  Trueman, waxing toward the confidential.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, young man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she interposed, almost
  severely. But his gaze evidently disconcerted her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Spillin&rsquo; rice
  might mean a weddin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She blushed, but spoke up with spirit. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t, so far as
  I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t know
  your affairs.... But you are wasting my time. I must hurry. They&rsquo;ll be
  waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock humbly apologized and proceeded to fill another bag with rice. Then
  he went on with the order, and for several moments, in which he kept his eyes
  averted, he performed very well as a clerk. He certainly prayed that Sol
  Winter would not come back soon. Who was she? He had never in his life met
  such a girl. She could not be married. Too young and&mdash;he did not know
  what! But the thought that she might be made his heart sink like cold lead.
  He stole a glance at her left hand. Ringless! What a strong, shapely hand,
  neither too large nor too small, nor red and rough like that of most
  ranchers&rsquo; daughters. It was, however, a hand that had seen work.
  Naturally Rock wondered if she rode a horse. The goddess of every
  cowboy&rsquo;s dreams was a horsewoman. Did he dare to ask her if she loved a
  horse? Rock divined that his usual audacity and adroitness with the feminine
  sex were wanting here.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the groceries,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I want
  buttons, thread, calico, dress goods, linen and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; queried Rock, as she paused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all <i>you</i> can get for me,&rdquo; she answered,
  enigmatically.</p>

  <p>At the dry-goods counter Rock was in a quandary. He could not find
  anything. The young lady calmly walked behind the counter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you read?&rdquo; she inquired, pointing at some
  boxes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read!&rdquo; exclaimed Trueman, in an injured tone. &ldquo;Sure I
  can read. I went to school for eight years. That&rsquo;s about four more than
  any cowpuncher I ever met.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! No one would suspect it,&rdquo; she returned, demurely.
  &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a cowboy&mdash;what&rsquo;re you doing in
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I just lately went to clerking,&rdquo; he hastened to reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show me the buttons. There&mdash;in the white boxes.... Thank
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While she bent over them, looking and assorting, Trueman regained
  something near composure, and he feasted his eyes on the little stray locks
  of fair hair that peeped from under her bonnet, on the small well-shaped ear,
  on the nape of her neck, beautiful and white, and upon the contour of
  cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pearl?&rdquo; she inquired, holding a button in her
  palm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; he replied, dreamily, meaning her cheek, suddenly,
  terribly aware of its nearness and sweetness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That pearl!&rdquo; she exclaimed in amaze, looking up.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know bone when you see it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;the button! I wasn&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; at it.... Sure
  that&rsquo;s bone. If you want pearl buttons, maybe I can help.&rdquo; And he
  bent over the box. It was not necessary to bend with his head so close to
  hers, but he did so, until he felt one of those stray silky locks of hair
  brush his cheek. She felt it, too, for there seemed to come a sudden still
  check to everything in connection with the business at hand. Then she drew
  away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I can help myself. You find the thread.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It turned out that she had to find the thread, too, and she did it so
  readily that Trueman inquired if she had ever been a clerk in this store. She
  laughed merrily and informed him that once, during fair week, she had helped
  Mr. Winter out for several days.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That explains. So you&rsquo;re a good friend of Sol
  Winter&rsquo;s?&rdquo; went on Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes indeed, ever since we came here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a good friend of Sol&rsquo;s, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must be&mdash;seeing he keeps you in his store,&rdquo; she
  said, slyly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m a poor clerk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not from a customer&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a poor clerk for Mr. Winter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She caught herself again being drawn into conversation and asked to see
  some calico. Rock espied the only bolt of this commodity on the shelves and
  drew it down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Calico! Sure this reminds me,&rdquo; he said with such enthusiasm
  that she had to attend. &ldquo;Once in Colorado I rode into a town. Gunnison.
  It was a Saturday. Big day. All the outfits were in. Everybody for miles
  around. Horses, wagons, buckboards on the streets. I bought a bolt of red
  calico, tied one end to the pommel of my saddle and left the bolt lyin&rsquo;
  on the ground. Then I rode up and down. In about ten minutes that street was
  a roarin&rsquo; millin&rsquo; <i>mêlée</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please cut me ten yards of this,&rdquo; she said, with steady eyes
  of disfavor upon him.</p>

  <p>Trueman made a mess of the job, to his secret chagrin and her evident
  despair. Then she asked for a certain kind of dress goods, utterly foreign to
  him, and which she had to locate herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much of this?&rdquo; asked Rock, stripping off yards of the
  soft material.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five. And I want it cut on the bias,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the bias,&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Oh, sure.&rdquo; And he went
  at the task desperately, realizing full well that he could not stand this
  deception much longer. But he had not progressed very far when she
  interrupted: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re measuring too much. I said yards&mdash;not
  miles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman vowed he would finish as he had begun. He went on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t guess on dress goods like that,&rdquo; she
  protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me! I could guess on anythin&rsquo; once,&rdquo; he retorted,
  wildly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed you look it. I never saw such a&mdash;But I can&rsquo;t
  afford&mdash;I <i>want</i> only five yards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss, this <i>is</i> five yards, roughly,&rdquo; he rejoined,
  beginning to cut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop! You&rsquo;ll ruin it. That&rsquo;s not the way I want it
  cut,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said on somethin&rsquo; or other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Clerk,&rdquo; she returned, manifestly at the end of
  her patience. She brushed him aside, and taking up the shears began carefully
  to cut the material to suit herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss&mdash;Clerk,&rdquo; spoke up Rock,
  contritely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not usually so dumb. But you see I never before
  waited on such a&mdash;a girl as you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shot him a gray glance not wholly doubtful or unforgiving. And meeting
  his eyes caused her to look down again with a tinge of color staining her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a clerk. Good Heavens! If the gangs I&rsquo;ve ridden
  with would drop in here to see me&mdash;doin&rsquo; this. Whew!... My name is
  Trueman Rock. I&rsquo;m an old friend of Sol Winter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock?&rdquo; she repeated, almost with a start, as she
  swiftly lifted big, questioning, surprised eyes. That name was not unfamiliar
  to her, but Rock could not tell whether she attached good or bad to it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I used to ride this range years ago. I&rsquo;ve been gone six
  years&mdash;five of which I&rsquo;ve spent in Texas, workin&rsquo; hard
  and&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d like you to know, because maybe you&rsquo;ve heard
  talk here. Workin&rsquo; hard and goin&rsquo; straight. I sold out.
  Somethin&rsquo; drew me back to Wagontongue. Got here today, and when I ran
  in to see Sol he left me here in charge of the store. Said no one would come
  in, but if some one did to wait on him... Well, as you see, <i>some one</i>
  did come in. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve annoyed you&mdash;kept you
  waitin&rsquo;. But it was Sol&rsquo;s fault. Only, I should have told you
  first off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t apologize, Mr. Rock,&rdquo; she replied, shyly.
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm done, except to the rice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; he returned, coolly. Now that
  the deception was past, he had begun to feel more like himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please wrap these for me,&rdquo; she said, pushing the cut goods
  along the counter, but she did not look up.</p>

  <p>Elaborately Trueman wrapped those parcels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charge to Thiry Preston,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>He found a pencil near at hand, and bending over a piece of wrapping
  paper, very business-like, he inquired:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Miss</i> Thiry Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>Miss</i>,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry. Pretty name. How do you spell it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;T-h-i-r-y,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

  <p>Trueman wrote down the name, in a clear bold hand, obviously to impress
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What place?&rdquo; he went on. Then as she stared, he continued,
  &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sunset Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Way out there?&rdquo; He glanced up in surprise. &ldquo;Sixty
  miles. I know that country&mdash;every waterhole, stone, bunch of cactus, and
  jack-rabbit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled fully for the first time, and that smile further fascinated
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were well acquainted, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I expect to renew old acquaintances out there. And I may be lucky
  enough to make new ones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Preston did not meet his glance and there was other evidence of
  discouragement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What instructions about these parcels?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None. I&rsquo;ll carry them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Carry them! All this heavy load? Thirty pounds or more!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely. I&rsquo;m quite strong. I&rsquo;ve carried far
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out to the corral. Our buckboard is there. They&rsquo;ll be waiting
  and I&rsquo;m late. I must hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In rather nervous haste she took up the several light packages and moved
  toward the other counter. Rock got there first and intercepted her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry these.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, but you needn&rsquo;t trouble. I can carry them
  easily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I really can&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo;
  returned Trueman, gathering together the bags of groceries. They made a
  bulky, if not heavy, load.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t leave the store,&rdquo; she protested.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, at this juncture Sol Winter hurriedly entered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, now, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he queried, with broad smile.
  &ldquo;Thiry, to think you&rsquo;d happen in just the wrong
  minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Winter, I didn&rsquo;t miss you at all,&rdquo; returned
  Thiry, gayly. &ldquo;Your new clerk was most obliging and&mdash;and
  capable&mdash;after I found the things I needed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw!&mdash;He&rsquo;s shore a fine clerk.... Thiry, meet True
  Rock, old rider an&rsquo; pard of mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;I remember now,&rdquo; she flashed. &ldquo;Is Mr. Rock the
  rider who once saved your son Nick?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Thiry,&rdquo; he replied, and turning to Rock he added,
  &ldquo;Son, this lass is Miss Thiry Preston, who&rsquo;s helped to make some
  hard times easier for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Happy to meet you, Miss Preston,&rdquo; beamed Rock, over his load
  of bundles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Rock,&rdquo; returned Thiry, with just a hint of
  mischief in her gray eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I was clerk and now I&rsquo;m delivery boy,&rdquo; said
  Trueman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten your hat,&rdquo; announced Thiry as he
  started off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I have. Sol, it&rsquo;s there behind the counter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The storekeeper picked up the sombrero and grinned as he placed it on
  Rock&rsquo;s head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, I&rsquo;ll be gibbered if I don&rsquo;t believe you hid
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thiry laughed with them. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
  you&rsquo;d worn <i>that</i>, I&rsquo;d never have taken you for a
  clerk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went out together and Trueman felt that he was soaring to the blue
  sky. The heavy bundles were as light as feathers. Outside in the sunshine he
  could see her better and it was as if some magic had transformed her. Really
  he had not seen her at all. He felt more deceitful than ever, for he kept
  turning to her to say ordinary things, about the heat, the dust, and what
  not, when he only wanted to look at her. They soon reached the end of the
  street and started across an open flat toward the corrals. How well Rock
  remembered them! A strange pang tore his breast. Was it regret and shame for
  the past&mdash;of something of which this girl might have heard?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in an awful hurry,&rdquo; finally complained
  Trueman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. I&rsquo;m late, and you don&rsquo;t
  know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not complete the sentence, but nevertheless it told Rock much.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This load is heavy. You&rsquo;d never have packed it,&rdquo;
  declared Trueman, slowing up. Any excuse was better than none. He was going
  to lose this wonderful girl in another moment. He wanted to prolong it. Slyly
  he pinched a hole in the bag of rice and it began to spill out in a thin
  stream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There! We&rsquo;ve rushed so we&rsquo;ve broken the sack,&rdquo; he
  went on. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s the rice, too!... Miss Thiry, it&rsquo;s an
  omen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad or good?&rdquo; she asked, archly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, good, of course&mdash;wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, I fear you are many things besides a clerk,&rdquo; she
  said, shaking her head sadly. &ldquo;Here, let me take the bag. I&rsquo;ll
  turn it upside down. If I had far to go with you I&rsquo;d have no groceries
  left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t it be great <i>if</i> we had farther to
  go?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that it would,&rdquo; she replied, dubiously.
  &ldquo;Especially if my dad was at the end of the walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your dad. Is he Gage Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he a terror?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed he is&mdash;to boys who come gallivanting after
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed Trueman, coolly.</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the first corral. The big gate swung ajar.
  The fence was planked and too high to see over. Loud voices and thud of hoofs
  came from somewhere, probably the second corral. Thiry led the way in. Rock
  espied some saddle-horses, a wagon, and then a double-seated buckboard
  hitched to a fine-looking team of roans.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said the girl, with evident relief. &ldquo;No
  one come yet! I&rsquo;m glad.... Put the bundles under the back seat, Mr.
  Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did this as directed, and then faced her, not knowing what to say,
  fearing the mingled feelings that swept over him and bewildered by them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all, you&rsquo;ve been very kind&mdash;even
  if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say if,&rdquo; he broke in, entreatingly.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil it by a single if. It&rsquo;s been the greatest
  adventure of my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of many like adventures, no doubt,&rdquo; she replied, her clear
  gray eyes on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met many girls in many ways, but there has never been
  anything like this,&rdquo; he returned, tensely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock!&rdquo; she protested, lifting a hand to her cheek, where
  a wave of scarlet burned.</p>

  <p>Then a clink of spurs, slow steps, and thuds of hoofs sounded behind Rock.
  They meant nothing particular to him until he saw the girl&rsquo;s color fade
  and her face turn white. A swift shadow darkened the great gray eyes. That
  broke Rock&rsquo;s emotion&mdash;changed the direction of his thought.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hyah she ish, Range,&rdquo; called out a coarse voice, somehow
  vibrant, despite a thick hint of liquor. &ldquo;With &rsquo;nother galoot,
  b&rsquo;gosh! Schecond one terday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slowly Rock turned on his heel, and in the turning went back to the
  original self that had been in abeyance for a while. When it came to dealing
  with men he was not a clerk.</p>

  <p>Two riders had entered the corral, and the foremost was in the act of
  dismounting. He was partly drunk, but that was not the striking thing about
  him. He looked and breathed the very spirit of the range at its wildest. He
  was tall, lean, lithe, with a handsome red face, like a devil&rsquo;s, eyes
  hot as blue flame, and yellow hair that curled scraggily from under a dusty
  black sombrero. He had just been clean-shaved. Drops of blood and sweat stood
  out like beads on his lean jowls and his curved lips. A gun swung below his
  hip.</p>

  <p>The other rider, called Range, was a cowboy, young in years, with still
  gray eyes like Miss Preston&rsquo;s, and intent, expressionless face, dark
  from sun and wind. Rock gathered, from the resemblance, that this boy was
  Thiry&rsquo;s brother. But who was the other? Rock had not met many of this
  type, but a few was enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, who&rsquo;s thish?&rdquo; queried the rider, dropping his
  bridle and striding forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can introduce myself,&rdquo; struck in Rock, coolly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Trueman Rock, late of Texas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell you shay!&rdquo; returned the other, ponderingly, as if trying
  to fit the name to something in memory. &ldquo;Whash you doin&rsquo;
  hyar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s any of your business, I was in Winter&rsquo;s
  store and packed over Miss Preston&rsquo;s bundles,&rdquo; replied Rock, in
  slow, dry speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw!&rdquo; guffawed the rider, derisively. He did not appear
  to be angry or jealous. He was just mean. Rock had formed his idea of what
  this man&rsquo;s wrath might be. That, and mostly a consideration for Miss
  Preston, made Rock wary. Who was he? Surely not a lover! The thought seemed
  to cut fiercely into Rock&rsquo;s inner flesh. &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; went on the
  tall rider presently, swaggering closer to Rock, &ldquo;run along, Big Hat,
  &rsquo;fore I reach you with a boot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ash!</i> You&rsquo;re drunk!&rdquo; burst out the girl, as if
  suddenly freeing her voice.</p>

  <p>The disgust and scorn and fear, and something else in her outbreak, caused
  Rock to turn. Miss Preston&rsquo;s face most wildly expressed these things.
  They instantly gave Rock tight rein on his own feelings. This rider, then,
  was Ash Preston, of whom Rock had heard significantly that day. Her brother!
  The relief Rock experienced outstressed anything else for the moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whosh drunk?&rdquo; queried Preston, placatingly, of his sister.
  &ldquo;Your mistake, Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you are drunk,&rdquo; she returned, with heat.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve insulted Mr. Rock, who was kind enough to help me carry
  things from the store.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll help Mishter Rock on his way,&rdquo; replied
  Preston, leering.</p>

  <p>Range, the other rider, like a flash leaped out of his saddle and jerked
  Preston&rsquo;s gun from its sheath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash, you look out,&rdquo; he called, sharply. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t know this fellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;WHASH I need gun fer?&rdquo; demanded Preston, half
  resentful of his brother&rsquo;s precaution.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure you don&rsquo;t, but you might if you had one,&rdquo; replied
  Range, with a grin. &ldquo;Anyway, Ash, you&rsquo;re shootin&rsquo; off your
  chin enough. I tell you this fellar&rsquo;s a stranger to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The younger rider had been bending his intent, clear gaze upon Rock and
  had formed conclusions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whash the hell we care? He&rsquo;s Big Hat, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  a-goin&rsquo; to chase him pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thiry Preston stepped out as if impelled, yet she was evidently clamped
  with fear. Rock was learning a good deal, but could not determine if her fear
  was on his account or on her brother&rsquo;s. Rock, swift in his impressions,
  conceived instant cold suspicion of this Ash Preston. He thought, for
  Thiry&rsquo;s sake, he had better make as graceful an exit as possible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please, Ash, be decent if you can&rsquo;t be a gentleman,&rdquo;
  begged Thiry.</p>

  <p>For answer Preston lurched by Thiry and swept out a long slow arm, with
  open hand, aimed at Rock&rsquo;s face. But Rock dodged, and at the same time
  stuck out his foot dexterously. The rider, his momentum unchecked, tripped
  and lost his balance. He fell slowly, helplessly, and striking on his
  shoulder he rolled over in the dirt. He sat up, ludicrously, and wiping the
  dust off his cheek he extended a long arm, with shaking hand, up at Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shay, you hit me, fellar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, you&rsquo;re quite wrong. I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whash you hit me with?&rdquo; he went on, sure that indignity had
  been committed upon him. Plain it was that his presence there on the ground
  was sufficient proof.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hit you with anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Range, is thish hyar Big Hat lyin&rsquo; to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. You jest fell over him,&rdquo; returned the younger rider,
  laconically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash, you&rsquo;re so drunk you can&rsquo;t stand up,&rdquo;
  interposed Thiry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, stranger, I&rsquo;m &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; your
  apology.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. You&rsquo;re sure considerate,&rdquo; returned Rock, with
  sarcasm. He was not used to total restraint and he could not remember when
  any man had jarred him so. Turning to the girl, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  go. Good-by, Miss Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With his back to the brothers Trueman made his eyes speak a great deal
  more than his words. The dullest of girls would have grasped that he did not
  mean good-by forever. Thiry&rsquo;s response to his gaze was a silent one of
  regret, of confusion, of something more of which she was unconscious.</p>

  <p>Rock did not pass the riders. He stepped up on the corral fence, reached
  the top rail, and vaulted over. Outside he saw men and horses coming, and was
  glad that they were not in line with him. Thoughts and emotions almost
  overwhelmed Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash Preston! Bad medicine! And he&rsquo;s her brother!&rdquo;
  muttered Rock, aloud. &ldquo;Sure as fate we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
  clash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At first he wanted to go off alone somewhere to think, to try and figure
  out what had happened and what to do about it. He halted on a street corner
  long enough to see the buckboard, the wagon, and several mounted riders move
  away briskly toward the south. Rock&rsquo;s sharp eye picked out
  Thiry&rsquo;s white dress and blue bonnet. Amazing and stirring was it to
  Rock that she turned to look back. She could see him standing there. Quickly
  the little cavalcade passed out of sight behind trees. Far to the southward
  rose a dim outline of rugged country, hazed in purple. Rock divined now that
  always he had been destined to return to this wild range. He broke away from
  the corner and the spell which had gripped him. What he must have now was
  information.</p>

  <p>He strode back to Sol Winter&rsquo;s store. The day was hot, and what with
  brisk exercise and the emotion under which he labored, he was wet with
  perspiration when he confronted his friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, son, what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; queried Sol, with
  concern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord knows. I&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; panted Rock, spilling off
  his sombrero and wiping his face. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s&mdash;a lot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, you took a shine to Thiry Preston. I seen that. No wonder.
  She&rsquo;s the sweetest lass who ever struck these parts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, we&rsquo;ll investigate my&mdash;my state of mind last,&rdquo;
  replied Rock, ruefully. &ldquo;Listen. I ran into the Preston
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! You don&rsquo;t look happy over it,&rdquo; said Winter,
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should smile I&rsquo;m not. But I only bumped into two of them.
  Thiry&rsquo;s brothers, Range and Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Hard luck,&rdquo; replied Winter, pertinently. His tone
  implied a good deal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think I saw the rest of them as I came away. Sol, I had to jump the
  fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed the storekeeper, unbelievingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure did,&rdquo; said Rock, with a laugh. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;
  And he related to his friend all that had occurred at the corral.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! Too bad for Thiry. She&rsquo;s always bein&rsquo; humiliated.
  No wonder she comes to town so seldom. Why, Rock, she&rsquo;s liked by
  everybody in this town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Liked! Sol, you old geezer, this here town ought to do better than
  that.... But I sure agree with you. Too bad for Miss Thiry. Oh, she felt
  hurt. I saw tears run down her cheeks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you took water from that Ash Preston?&rdquo; mused
  Winter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure did. Gee! it felt queer. But I&rsquo;d taken a beatin&rsquo;
  for that girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, you have changed. You&rsquo;re bigger, stronger. You&rsquo;ve
  grown&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Sol. Don&rsquo;t make me out so much that you&rsquo;ll
  have to crawl later. But if I have improved a little I&rsquo;m thankin&rsquo;
  the Lord.... Sol, I meant to get terrible drunk till that girl stepped in
  this store.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; <i>now</i> you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; queried Winter,
  gladly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! I wouldn&rsquo;t take a drink for a million dollars,&rdquo;
  replied Rock, with a ring in his voice. &ldquo;You should have seen
  Thiry&rsquo;s face&mdash;have heard her when she said,
  &lsquo;Ash&mdash;you&rsquo;re <i>drunk</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Thiry hates drink. She has cause. Most of the Prestons
  are a drinkin&rsquo; lot.... But, son, are you serious?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious? I think so,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, grimly.
  &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has bein&rsquo; with Thiry Preston for a little while changed your
  idea about red liquor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, it sure has. I don&rsquo;t know just what&rsquo;s happened to
  me, but <i>that</i> you can gamble on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, it sounds good. If it isn&rsquo;t just excitement.&mdash;Why,
  most every young fellar&mdash;an&rsquo; some older ones&mdash;in this country
  have been struck by lightnin&rsquo; when they first seen Thiry. But I
  can&rsquo;t see that it did them good. For they drank only the harder. Thiry
  isn&rsquo;t to be courted, they say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Struck by lightnin&rsquo;. Sure that might be it. But never you
  mind about me. I&rsquo;m solid on my feet even if my head&rsquo;s in the
  clouds.... Tell me things. I want to know all about this Preston
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, you&rsquo;re hot-headed. You fly off the handle,&rdquo;
  returned Winter, gravely. &ldquo;You might give me more trouble with the
  Prestons. I&rsquo;ve had considerable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, you can trust me,&rdquo; said Rock, earnestly.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re old friends. I&rsquo;m back here for good. I&rsquo;ll
  absolutely not give you any more trouble. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to help you.
  So come out with everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Same old Rock,&rdquo; mused Winter. &ldquo;No, not the same,
  either. There&rsquo;s a difference I can&rsquo;t name yet. Mebbe it&rsquo;s a
  few years.... Wal, this Preston outfit is sure prominent in these parts. They
  call them &lsquo;The Thirteen Prestons of Sunset Pass.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a
  big family. Nobody seems to know where they come from. Anyway, they drove a
  herd of cattle in here some time after you left. An&rsquo;
  &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; Ash Preston, they&rsquo;re just about the most likable
  outfit you ever seen. Fact is, they&rsquo;re like Thiry. So you don&rsquo;t
  need to be told more about that. They located in Sunset Pass, right on the
  Divide. You know the place. An&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t long until they were
  known all over the range. Wonderful outfit with horses and ropes. Fact is, I
  never saw the beat of Gage Preston for a real Westerner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Sol. It&rsquo;s sure like a story to me. What was the
  trouble you had?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They ran up a big bill in my store. The old store, you remember. I
  taxed the boys about it. Didn&rsquo;t see Gage along there. Well, it was Ash
  Preston who raised the hell. He wasn&rsquo;t drunk then. An&rsquo;, son, you
  need to be told that Ash is wild when he&rsquo;s drunk. When sober
  he&rsquo;s&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s different.... Nick was alone in the store.
  Nick was a spunky lad, you know, an&rsquo; he razzed Ash somethin&rsquo;
  fierce. Result was Ash piled the lad in a corner an&rsquo; always hated him
  afterward. Fact is the range talk says Ash Preston hates everybody except
  Thiry. She&rsquo;s the only one who can do anythin&rsquo; with
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot today. The
  drunken&mdash;&mdash;!...And Nick was shot off his horse out there in Sunset
  Pass?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve never breathed to anyone my natural
  suspicion. I think Ash Preston must have killed Nick. They must have met
  an&rsquo; fought it out. Sure it wasn&rsquo;t murder. Ash would not shoot any
  man in the back. There were four empty shells, fresh shot, in Nick&rsquo;s
  gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The boy had nerve and he was no slouch with a six-shooter. I
  wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Gage paid the bill first time he came to town. Then for a
  while he didn&rsquo;t buy from me. But one day Thiry came in, an&rsquo; ever
  since I&rsquo;ve sold goods to the Prestons. But none of them save Thiry have
  ever been in my store since. She does the orderin&rsquo; an&rsquo; she pays
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh.... Any range talk among the punchers about these
  Prestons?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, you know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, son, there used to be no more than concerned the Culvers, or
  Tolls, or Smiths, an&rsquo; not so much as used to be about the little
  outfits down in the woods. You know the range. All the outfits eat one
  another&rsquo;s cattle. It was a kind of unwritten code. But, lately, the
  last two years, conditions have gone on the same, in that way, an&rsquo; some
  different in another. I hear a good deal of complaint about the
  rustlin&rsquo; of cattle. An&rsquo; a few dark hints about the Prestons have
  seeped in to me off the range. Darn few, mind you, son, an&rsquo; sure vague
  an&rsquo; untrailable. It might be owin&rsquo; to the slow gettin&rsquo; rich
  of Gage Preston. It&rsquo;s a fact. He&rsquo;s growin&rsquo; rich. Not so you
  could see it much in cattle, but in land an&rsquo; money in bank. I happen to
  know he has a bank account in Los Vegas. That&rsquo;s pretty far off, you
  know, an&rsquo; it looks queer to me. Found it out by accident. I buy from a
  wholesale grocer in Los Vegas. He happened here, an&rsquo; in a talk dropped
  that bit of information. It&rsquo;s sure not known here in Wagontongue,
  an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; you to keep it under your hat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Gage Preston one of these lone cattlemen?&rdquo; queried Rock,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not now, but he sure was once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he in with now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John Dabb. They own the Bar X outfit. It&rsquo;s not so much. Dabb
  has the big end of it. Then Dabb runs a butcher shop. Fact is he undersold me
  an&rsquo; put me out of that kind of business. He buys mostly from Preston.
  An&rsquo; he ships a good many beeves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ships? Out of town?&rdquo; asked Rock, in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should smile. They have worked into a considerable business, with
  prospects. I saw this opportunity years ago, but didn&rsquo;t have the
  capital.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock pondered over his friend&rsquo;s disclosures, trying to reduce them
  down to something significant. They might be and very probably were perfectly
  regular transactions. He could never split hairs over deals pertaining to the
  cattle range. Thiry Preston&rsquo;s sad face returned to haunt him. Surely
  she was too young, too healthy and good for marked sadness of expression,
  such as had struck him forcibly. He felt more than he could explain. This
  girl had dawned upon him like a glorious sunrise. His perceptions and
  emotions had been superlatively augmented by he knew not what. He could not
  be sure of anything except that he vowed to find out why Thiry&rsquo;s eyes
  hid a shadow in their gray depths.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, what do you think about Ash Preston?&rdquo; asked Rock, coming
  out of his reverie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, son, I&rsquo;m sure curious to ask you that same
  question,&rdquo; replied Winter, with humor. &ldquo;You used to be as wild as
  they come. You know the range. How did this fellow strike you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like a hard fist, right in the eye,&rdquo; acknowledged Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. I&rsquo;m glad your sojourn in Texas hasn&rsquo;t dulled your
  edge,&rdquo; said Winter, with satisfaction. &ldquo;Rock, the Prestons are
  all out of the ordinary. Take Thiry, for instance. How did <i>she</i> strike
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman placed a slow heavy hand on the region of his heart, and gazed at
  his friend as if words were useless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t give two bits for you if she hadn&rsquo;t.
  Son, I&rsquo;ve a hunch your comin&rsquo; back means a lot.... Wal, to go
  on&mdash;these Prestons are a mighty strikin&rsquo; outfit. An&rsquo; Ash
  Preston stands out even among them. He&rsquo;s a great rider of the range in
  all pertainin&rsquo; to that hard game. He can drink more, fight harder,
  shoot quicker than any man in these parts. You used to throw a gun yourself,
  Rock. I&rsquo;m wonderin&rsquo; did you get out of practice in Texas? But
  Texas, now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; interrupted Rock, curtly. He was shy on talk about
  gun-play.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, son. Well, to resoom, Ash Preston is sure the meanest,
  coldest, nerviest, deadliest proposition you&rsquo;re likely to stack up
  against in your life. I just want to give you a hunch, seein&rsquo; you went
  sweet on Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, old friend. Forewarned is forearmed, you know. The man was
  drunk when I met him, but I think I grasped a little of what you
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter evidently found more in this reply to worry him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, you know what the risk is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, what do I care for risks?&rdquo; burst out Rock,
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, you always were a sudden cuss, but even so, you could hardly
  get serious&mdash;real serious over Thiry Preston so quick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean&mdash;serious?&rdquo; snapped Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sweet on her, I mean,&rdquo; answered Winter, hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sweet on <i>that</i> girl! No! I&rsquo;ve been sweet on a hundred
  girls. This is different. I don&rsquo;t know what. I&rsquo;ll have to dig
  into myself and see. But it&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; terrible. Ten thousand
  times sweet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, you needn&rsquo;t bite my head off,&rdquo; protested Winter.
  &ldquo;If you want to know, I&rsquo;m tickled stiff&mdash;an&rsquo; scared to
  death. I love that girl. An&rsquo; if you haven&rsquo;t forgot, I was once
  some fond of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten,&rdquo; replied Rock, with warmth.
  &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you dare ever mention my&mdash;my old girl friends.
  And if you&rsquo;d dare to tell Thiry I&rsquo;d murder you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody will tell her, son. For instance, Mrs. John Dabb. She
  likes Thiry. She&rsquo;ll tell her. I see them together
  occasionally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. John Dabb. She couldn&rsquo;t know much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you she was Amy Wund.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oww!&rdquo; wailed Rock, bending double.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, your trail will sure be rough,&rdquo; returned Winter,
  wagging his grizzled head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, old friend. There&rsquo;s only one thing that could stump
  me. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do. But I mean
  there&rsquo;s only one thing that could queer this&mdash;this beautiful dream
  almost before it starts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me. Do you know Thiry real well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, son, an&rsquo; I can answer that question so plain in your
  eyes. Thiry is not in love with anybody. I know, because she told me herself,
  not so long ago. She loves her family, especially Ash. But there&rsquo;s no
  one else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll&mdash;help,&rdquo; replied Rock, swallowing hard.
  &ldquo;Now, Sol, I&rsquo;ll sneak off alone somewhere and try to find out
  what&rsquo;s the matter with me&mdash;and what to do about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman sallied forth into the sunlight like a man possessed. He did not
  know whether he was trying to escape from himself or find himself. It had
  been all very well to talk loftily to Sol Winter, but now that he was out in
  the open many feelings began to edge into his incomprehensible buoyancy.</p>

  <p>He did not notice the heat while he was striding out of town, but when he
  got to the cedars and mounted a slope to a lonely spot he was grateful for
  the cool shade. He threw aside coat and sombrero, and lay down on the
  fragrant mat of cedar needles. How good to be there! He became aware of his
  labored breathing, of moist, restless hands, of hot face. Excitement was
  strong upon him.</p>

  <p>It would not do to dream&mdash;at least not until he had settled things
  with himself. Rock always went to the loneliness and silence of desert or
  forest when in any kind of trouble. He had not been in this shady spot for
  five minutes before the insidious spell of nature prevailed. He could think
  here. He heard the hum of bees, melodious on the mellow summer air; and the
  shrill call of a yellowhammer. A jack-rabbit went bobbing by, and there was a
  rustling of the dry leaves of brush near at hand.</p>

  <p>Only one thing had stood in the way of a happy return to Wagontongue, and
  that had been possibility of a clash with Cass Seward, the sheriff. This now
  no longer perturbed him. It had been reckless, perhaps foolish, for him to
  come back, when he had known that the probabilities were that Cass would try
  to make him show yellow and clap him in jail, because of a shooting affray
  which Rock had not started. But it had been Rock&rsquo;s way to come, not
  knowing; and there certainly had been only a remote chance of his
  surrendering to Cass. That hazard was past. Rock paid tribute to the dead
  sheriff, and gladly welcomed the fact that he had a clean slate before
  him.</p>

  <p>That gray-eyed girl Thiry Preston! Here he did surrender. He had been
  struck through the heart. And all the fight there was seemed directed against
  himself&mdash;a wavering, lessening doubt that he could be as marvelously
  transformed as he thought. And then, one by one, in solemn procession, there
  passed before his memory&rsquo;s eye the other girls he had known, trifled
  with, liked, or loved. A few stood out brightly. He watched them pass by, out
  of the shade, it seemed, into the past forever. He had imagined he had cared;
  he had thought he had suffered. All that had been nothing. Thiry Preston had
  made them vanish, as if by magic. Trueman did not sentimentalize or argue
  about it. She was the girl. All his life he had been dreaming of her. To
  realize she actually lived! Nor did he ask himself any questions about love.
  Whatever it was, it had been sudden, inevitable, and fearsome only in its
  premonition of tremendous might.</p>

  <p>This was not decision, but a realization and acceptance. Decision had to
  do with remaining at or near Wagontongue, and it was made the instant the
  question presented. He would ask Gage Preston for a job riding, and if one
  was not available he would ask some other cattleman. Not likely was it that
  any rancher thereabouts would not find a place for Trueman Rock. In such
  event, however, he could go into the cattle business himself. He had enough
  money for a good start, and the idea had always appealed to him. Still, he
  did not want to hurry into that. Range conditions had changed, and no doubt
  competition was greater. Also sheep-raising had begun to eat its way out over
  the pastures. Rock had a cattleman&rsquo;s healthy dislike for sheep. It
  would be better to start again as he had started there years ago&mdash;a poor
  cowboy. What to do with his money? It had somehow become precious. Always it
  had been his habit, when he had any money, to carry it on him until he spent
  it. And that had not been long. This, however, would never do now. He would
  ask Winter about a safe investment. And as for minor considerations, there
  seemed to be some reason or other for Trueman to have a couple of
  thoroughbred horses to go with his showy saddle and the other fine
  accouterments he had brought with him.</p>

  <p>The thought of Ash Preston was disturbing. When Rock, having burned his
  bridges behind him, tried to give up to the trance-like memory of Thiry, this
  wild brother obtruded his evil fame and person to spoil it. Rock had a
  premonition that he would have trouble with Preston, but he deliberately
  refused to harbor it. He absolutely must not fight with Thiry&rsquo;s
  brother. There might be ways to propitiate Ash, and Rock promised himself
  that he would go far. But if he could not get along with Ash he could keep
  out of his way. Fortunately, it was not likely that the range would ever
  believe True Rock shied from meeting any man. Rather it had been that he had
  gone out of his way to meet men. Had he not come back to Wagontongue ignorant
  of Seward&rsquo;s death? He had always intended to return.</p>

  <p>At length Rock left the cedar nook and started to retrace his steps. He
  had come quite high up the slope, and he could see the town below, and beyond
  it, to the south. Wagontongue had grown considerably, and from this
  vantage-point it looked promising. Some day it would grow into an important
  center.</p>

  <p>Far to the south, across a belt of gray desert, rose the range country. It
  looked its reputation. It rolled away to east and west, far as eye could see,
  an empire for cattlemen, needing only water to make it a paradise. Capital
  and labor would some day bring that vast land to its limit of production.</p>

  <p>Folding down over the range at its southern line lay the purple broken
  highlands of rock and gorge and forest, and above these rose the black
  mountains, not peaked, but wave on wave of great flat domes limned against
  the blue. The scene caused Trueman to draw a deep breath. He could not
  discern Sunset Pass from that point, but he saw the bulge of mountains into
  which it opened to the west.</p>

  <p>Rock returned to town and Winter&rsquo;s store. His friend was busy with
  customers, so Rock betook himself towards the hotel. A young woman, coming
  out of Dabb&rsquo;s large establishment, almost ran into Rock. It might have
  been his fault, because he was lost in thought. He tried to avoid her, but
  she did not make a like effort.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, touching his hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True Rock&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you going to speak to me?&rdquo; she
  burst out.</p>

  <p>He knew the voice, the face, too, the dark, sparkling, astonished eyes.
  But who was this holding out both gloved hands?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know <i>me</i>?&rdquo; she asked, with
  mingled reproach and gayety. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Amy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Indeed it was. Amy Wund, older, fuller of figure, with dark flushed face
  and roguish eyes. She was richly and fashionably dressed, and that fact,
  somehow, put surprise and confusion far from Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Dabb, this is a surprise!&rdquo; he said, doffing his
  sombrero, and bowing over her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad to see
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dabb? Not Amy?&rdquo; she rejoined, with captivating smile and
  look Rock found strangely familiar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some one told me you were married to my old boss, John Dabb,&rdquo;
  said Rock, easily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true, but you can call me Amy, as you used
  to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock smiled, but did not avail himself of the gracious privilege.
  &ldquo;You sure look well and fine. And prosperous, too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not like his penetrating gaze and his slow, cool speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, I can return the compliment. You are handsomer than
  ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look your years, cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I so ancient? I plumb forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, you&rsquo;re not glad to see me,&rdquo; she rejoined, almost
  petulantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, sure I am! Glad you&rsquo;re settled and happy
  and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Happy! Do I look that?&rdquo; she interrupted, bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If my memory&rsquo;s any good you look as gay and happy as
  ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your memory is bad&mdash;about that&mdash;and other things....
  Trueman, have you come back on a visit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I aim to stay. I always was comin&rsquo; back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you only had come!&rdquo; she sighed and looked eloquently up at
  him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;terribly glad you&rsquo;re going to stay. We
  must be good friends again, True. You&rsquo;ll come to see me&mdash;ride with
  me&mdash;like you used to. Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Mr. Dabb wouldn&rsquo;t like that. He never had
  any use for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what he likes,&rdquo; returned the young
  woman, impatiently. &ldquo;Say you will, Trueman. I&rsquo;m horribly
  lonesome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock remembered that Amy had always been a flirt, but he had imagined she
  would change after marriage. Evidently she had not changed. It was rather a
  melancholy moment for him, realizing that he could no more dangle after her
  than fly, and he was sorry for her and wished to spare her discomfiture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call on you and John sometime,&rdquo; he replied, with
  all friendliness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me and&mdash;John!... Well, your long absence in Texas hasn&rsquo;t
  made you any brighter. I dare say it hasn&rsquo;t changed you any&mdash;about
  girls, either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; he drawled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw you with Thiry Preston,&rdquo; she went on, spitefully.
  &ldquo;At your old tricks, cowboy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you? I don&rsquo;t call it old tricks to carry a few bundles
  for a girl,&rdquo; replied Rock, stiffly. It annoyed him to feel the blood
  heat his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bundles, rot!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I saw you through a
  window and anybody could have read your mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! Could you read it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re such a mind-reader, what am I thinkin&rsquo;
  about now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not flattering to me&mdash;I have that hunch,&rdquo; she
  snapped. &ldquo;Oh, I know you, True Rock, inside and out. You&rsquo;ve lost
  your head pronto over Thiry Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denyin&rsquo; it, am I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re flaunting it like a red flag right in my face. Well,
  I&rsquo;m telling you, cowboy, that this once you&rsquo;ve lost your head for
  nothing. Thiry Preston will have none of you. I know her. She is not your
  kind. She&rsquo;s cold as ice to every cowboy on this range. Heaven knows,
  they&rsquo;ve run after her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks for that last news, anyhow,&rdquo; he responded, dryly.</p>

  <p>She was searching the very depths of him, her eyes keen with jealous
  intuition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More. Thiry Preston has no use for lovesick cowboys, much less one
  like you, who&rsquo;ve been at the beck and call of every girl in the land.
  And she worships that handsome devil of a brother, Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hold it a virtue for a girl to love her
  brother&mdash;whether he was bad or good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah! Thiry Preston is queer. Some folks say her love is
  unnatural.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Folks around Wagontongue talk a lot,&rdquo; returned Rock,
  significantly. &ldquo;Sure used to say some unkind things about you.... Good
  day, Mrs. Dabb,&rdquo; he concluded, rather coldly, and replacing his
  sombrero he turned away, not, however, without catching a last angry blaze of
  her eyes. Could he ever have been in love with that catty woman? But he tried
  to feel kindly, in spite of vague pain she had aroused. Sober thought
  acquitted him of any blame for her evident disappointment with life. She had
  trifled with love; she had never known her own mind; and now she was reaping
  the tares. She would be his enemy, of that he was full sure, unless he
  allowed himself once more to be attached to her train. The idea was
  preposterous. In a few short hours&mdash;no, they were hours incalculably
  long in their power&mdash;he had grown past flirting with any woman. Life had
  suddenly become sweet, strange, full of fears and hopes, something real and
  poignant, such as he had never experienced before.</p>

  <p>Rock, instead of entering the hotel, returned to Winter, whom he found
  unoccupied, and proceeded to unburden himself. He told the last thing
  first.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you run into Amy,&rdquo; meditated Sol, with a thoughtful
  twinkle. &ldquo;Reckon you might have expected that. An&rsquo; she knocked
  the wind out of you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She sure did. You see, I&rsquo;d really forgotten Amy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, son, take my advice and keep shy of Amy. She&rsquo;s got old
  Dabb so jealous he can&rsquo;t attend to his business. She always has some
  buckaroo runnin&rsquo; after her. That won&rsquo;t do for you. Dabb had
  reason to hate you long ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh. I reckon I haven&rsquo;t forgotten. But no fear, old pard. I
  wouldn&rsquo;t run after Amy even if Dabb wanted me to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be like her to hate you, same as he did. An&rsquo;
  that&rsquo;d not be so good. The Dabbs about own Wagontongue, not to say a
  lot of the range outfits. Sure John&rsquo;s brothers are ruled by him. I told
  you he bought beef from Gage Preston. Then I always see Thiry with Amy, when
  she comes to town. If you aim to snub your old girl for this new
  one&mdash;wal, son, you&rsquo;ll have a rough row to hoe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I&rsquo;ll not snub Amy, but I can&rsquo;t go playin&rsquo;
  round with her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;ll expect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, what did Amy mean by sayin&rsquo; Thiry had an unnatural love
  for her brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Sure I never seen anythin&rsquo; unnatural
  about Thiry. An&rsquo;, Rock, I&rsquo;ve heard that very same remark before.
  It&rsquo;s just low-down talk by nasty people. All the same, it bothered
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sort of jarred me. Funny how gossip can sting you, even when you
  know where it comes from.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I seen you&rsquo;d been jarred some, when you first come in.
  You went out ridin&rsquo; the air. Anythin&rsquo; else happen beside
  buttin&rsquo; into Mrs. Dabb?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a lot. But it all happened <i>in</i>-side me.... Sol, how much
  money do you owe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Couple of thousand, an&rsquo; when that&rsquo;s paid off I&rsquo;ll
  be on the road to prosperity again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old-timer, you&rsquo;re on it right now. I&rsquo;ll take that much
  stock in your business,&rdquo; went on Rock, crisp and business-like, as he
  took out his pocketbook.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I don&rsquo;t want you to do that,&rdquo; protested
  Winter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I want to. I think it&rsquo;s a good investment. Now
  here&rsquo;s your two thousand. And here&rsquo;s five more, which I want you
  to put in your bank, on interest, but fixed so you can draw it out
  quick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want it to your name, of course?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Put it in yours. Reckon we&rsquo;d better add another thousand
  to that five. I only need enough money to buy a spankin&rsquo;
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, suppose somethin&rsquo; happened to you,&rdquo; said Winter,
  gravely, as he fingered the money. &ldquo;It might. You know this is a sudden
  country. An&rsquo;, Rock, you&rsquo;ve got fire in your eye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, my parents are livin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; though old,
  they&rsquo;re in good health. They live in Illinois. I was brought up in
  western Illinois, town of Carthage. Went to school there till I was fourteen.
  Then we moved to Nebraska. Dad went in for ranchin&rsquo; and lost all he
  invested. Then my folks went back home, but I stayed on, and drifted all over
  till I landed here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I always was curious about you&mdash;where you come from, if
  you had any folks. I&rsquo;m sure glad they&rsquo;re livin&rsquo;. How old
  are you, Trueman, if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll never see thirty-two again,&rdquo; returned Rock,
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you don&rsquo;t say, really. Thirty-two! Cowboy, you sure hide
  your age. Fact is, you always was a mysterious cuss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To go on about the money. If anythin&rsquo; should happen to
  me&mdash;which I&rsquo;m gamblin&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t&mdash;you send this
  six thousand to my folks. I&rsquo;ll leave the address with you. Also some
  papers and things for safe-keepin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; how about the two thousand you&rsquo;re investin&rsquo;
  with me?&rdquo; queried Sol, with a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can just forget about that, pardner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter shook his lean old head sagaciously, almost sadly. &ldquo;Son, you
  were always open-handed. How did you ever save all this money?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never did save it, Sol,&rdquo; returned Rock, with a laugh.
  &ldquo;Went in with a pretty big rancher in Texas. He had enemies&mdash;one
  of them a sure-enough crooked hombre. I just naturally gravitated toward
  removin&rsquo; that hombre from disfigurin&rsquo; the general landscape down
  there. My pardner did well after that. Then a railroad came our way. We sold
  out, and I found myself with ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!&rdquo; exclaimed Winter, his eyes narrowing to slits.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; you found yourself needin&rsquo; to get out of
  Texas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Sol, there sure wasn&rsquo;t any need of my gettin&rsquo; out
  at all,&rdquo; replied Rock, dryly. &ldquo;I hung round for weeks to give my
  pardner&rsquo;s enemies the chance they circulated round they were
  lookin&rsquo; for. But they didn&rsquo;t seem to be lookin&rsquo; very bad
  for it. So I got homesick and hit out for Wagontongue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad, yet I know you&rsquo;ll keep me scared stiff
  all the time.... Wal, son, out with it. What&rsquo;s under that big
  hat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be a plain cowpuncher and start in where I
  left off here six years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of pretendin&rsquo; to be poor, when
  you&rsquo;ve got a big stake for a cowboy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorts of suits me, Sol.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need an outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. I want a jim-dandy outfit, you bet. Two
  saddle-horses&mdash;the best on the range, if money can buy them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can find one of them pronto,&rdquo; replied Winter, with
  satisfaction. &ldquo;Come out to my house for supper. Wife will be happy to
  see you. She was fond of you, son.... After supper we&rsquo;ll walk out to
  Leslie&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s sellin&rsquo; out an&rsquo; he has some good
  stock. One horse in particular. I never saw his beat. Dabb has been
  hagglin&rsquo; with Leslie over the price. It&rsquo;s high, but the horse is
  worth it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three hundred.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&mdash;When I used to buy the best of horses for
  fifty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you never laid eyes on one as good as Leslie&rsquo;s. Wait
  till you see it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Sol. We&rsquo;ll buy. But reckon one saddle-horse will
  do. Then I&rsquo;ll need a pack-horse and outfit. In the mornin&rsquo;
  we&rsquo;ll pick out a tarp and blankets, grub and campin&rsquo; outfit.
  I&rsquo;ve got saddle, bridle, spurs, riata&mdash;all Mexican, Sol, and if
  they don&rsquo;t knock the punchers on this range, I&rsquo;ll eat them. My
  Texas pardner gave them to me. And last, I reckon I&rsquo;ll require some
  more hardware.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This last came reluctantly with a smile not quite grim from Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!... An&rsquo; with all this outfit you&rsquo;re headin&rsquo;
  for Sunset Pass,&rdquo; asserted Winter, wholly grim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ride down slow and easy-like,
  renewin&rsquo; old acquaintances and makin&rsquo; new ones. Then I&rsquo;ll
  end up at Gage Preston&rsquo;s and strike him for a job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What at? Ridin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Milkin&rsquo; the cows, if nothin&rsquo; else offers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, it&rsquo;s a bold move, if it&rsquo;s all on account of
  Thiry,&rdquo; returned Winter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you it&rsquo;s all on account
  of Thiry,&rdquo; replied Rock, imitating his friend&rsquo;s solemnity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gage Preston can&rsquo;t hardly refuse you a job,&rdquo; went on
  Winter. &ldquo;He needs riders. He has hired about every cowpuncher on the
  range. But they don&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash gets rid of them, sooner or later. Reckon about as soon as they
  shine up to Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How does he do that?&rdquo; queried Rock, curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he scares most of them. Some he has bunged up with his fists.
  An&rsquo; several punchers he&rsquo;s driven to throw guns.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kill them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. They say he just crippled them. Ash shoots quick an&rsquo;
  where he wants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most interestin&rsquo; cuss&mdash;Ash Preston,&rdquo; said Rock,
  lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, this is what worries me,&rdquo; went on Winter, with gravity.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be some different when Ash Preston butts into
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How you mean, pardner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, no matter how easy an&rsquo; cool you start&mdash;no matter
  how clever you are&mdash;it&rsquo;s bound to wind up a deadly
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, old-timer. I get your hunch. I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; it
  serious and strong. Don&rsquo;t worry unreasonable about me. I&rsquo;ve
  <i>got</i> to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">TRUEMAN ROCK was not one of the cowboy breed who cared only
  for pitching, biting, kicking horses. He could ride them, when exigency
  demanded, but he never loved a horse for other than thoroughbred qualities.
  And sitting on the corral fence watching Leslie&rsquo;s white favorite, he
  was bound to confess that he felt emotions of his earliest days on the
  range.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, True, did you ever see the beat of that hoss?&rdquo; asked Sol
  Winter, for the twentieth time.</p>

  <p>Rock shook his head silently.</p>

  <p>Leslie, a tall rancher in overalls and boots, stood inside the corral.
  &ldquo;Reckon I haven&rsquo;t had time to take care of him lately. He&rsquo;s
  had the run of the range. There hasn&rsquo;t been a leg thrown over him for a
  year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him, Leslie, and consider the deal a lastin&rsquo;
  favor,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;m glad. Dabb said yesterday he&rsquo;d buy him
  an&rsquo; send out today. But you beat Dabb to it. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t
  want Dabb to have him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you against Dabb?&rdquo; inquired Rock.</p>

  <p>Leslie laughed shortly. &ldquo;Me? Aw, nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dabb has been wantin&rsquo; this hoss, didn&rsquo;t you tell
  me, Jim?&rdquo; asked Winter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon so. She has been out here often. But I don&rsquo;t
  think Mrs. Dabb really cared about the horse so much. She just wanted to show
  off with him. But today there was a girl here who loved him, an&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;d shore have liked to let her have him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was she, Jim?&rdquo; asked Winter, with a knowing wink up at
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry Preston. She passed here today with her dad an&rsquo; some of
  the boys. Gage stopped to have a talk with me. All the Prestons are keen on
  hosses, but they won&rsquo;t pay much. Hossflesh is plenty cheap out Sunset
  Pass way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did Miss Preston do?&rdquo; queried Rock, casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She just petted the hoss while the other Prestons walked around,
  talkin&rsquo; a lot. Miss Thiry never said a word. But I seen her heart in
  her eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speaks well for her,&rdquo; replied Rock, with constraint, as he
  slid off the fence and approached the animal. If this beautiful white horse
  had appeared desirable in his eyes upon first sight, what was he now? Rock
  smoothed the silky mane, thrilling at the thought that Thiry&rsquo;s gentle
  hand had rested there. &ldquo;Leslie, I&rsquo;ll come out in the
  mornin&rsquo;. I want a pack-horse or a mule.... Here&rsquo;s your money.
  Shake on it. What&rsquo;s one man&rsquo;s loss is another&rsquo;s
  gain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw the pack-hoss in to boot,&rdquo; replied
  Leslie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol,&rdquo; said Rock, thoughtfully, as they retraced their steps
  toward town, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hardly have time to look up folks I used to
  know. Reckon it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I can leave that till I hit town again.
  ... Do the Prestons come in often?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of them every Saturday, shore as it rolls round. Thiry comes
  in about twice a month.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty long ride in from Sunset. Sixty miles by trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a new road, part way. Longer but better
  travelin&rsquo;. Goes by Tanner&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon the Prestons make a one-night stop at some ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. They&rsquo;re not much on that sort of travel. They camp it,
  makin&rsquo; Cedar Creek, where they turn off into a flat. Good grass
  an&rsquo; water. There&rsquo;s an old cabin. It belonged to a homesteader.
  Preston owns it now. Thiry was tellin&rsquo; me they&rsquo;d fixed it up.
  When they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; to town, she an&rsquo; the other womenfolks
  sleep there, an&rsquo; the men throw beds outside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Queer how all about these Prestons interests me so,&rdquo; said
  Rock, half to himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so queer. Leavin&rsquo; Thiry aside, they&rsquo;re a mighty
  interestin&rsquo; outfit,&rdquo; returned Winter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find
  that so pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll find out a lot pronto,&rdquo; said Trueman.
  &ldquo;Never could keep things from comin&rsquo; my way, particularly
  trouble. But, Sol, in all my life no adventure I ever rode down on could
  touch this one. I&rsquo;m soberin&rsquo; a little and realize how crazy it
  seems to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not crazy, son,&rdquo; replied Winter, earnestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  wild, perhaps, to let yourself go over this girl all in a minute. But then,
  wild or no it might turn out good for Thiry Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, why is her face so sad?&rdquo; queried Rock, stirred by his
  friend&rsquo;s implication.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve asked her why she looks
  sad&mdash;which you can see when she&rsquo;s not speakin&rsquo;, but she
  always makes herself smile an&rsquo; laugh then. Says she can&rsquo;t help
  her face an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s sorry I don&rsquo;t like it. Rock, it hurts
  Thiry, sort of startles her, to mention that. It makes her think of
  somethin&rsquo; unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for me to find out,&rdquo; said Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. I&rsquo;ve always been puzzled an&rsquo; troubled over
  Thiry. My wife, too. An&rsquo; True, it&rsquo;ll please you that she took
  kindly to your sudden case over Thiry. She says, &lsquo;If Trueman Rock stops
  his drinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; gun-throwin&rsquo; an&rsquo; settles down to
  real ranchin&rsquo; he could give that girl what she needs.&rsquo;... She
  didn&rsquo;t say <i>what</i> Thiry needs. So we can only guess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I&rsquo;ll sure have to get away from you. Else you&rsquo;ll
  have me locoed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, I may be wrong thinkin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve growed to be a
  man.... But one last word. This here has been stickin&rsquo; in my craw.
  These Prestons have heard all about you, naturally, an&rsquo; when you ride
  out on the range it&rsquo;ll all come fresh again. No cowboy ever had a finer
  reputation than you&mdash;for bein&rsquo; keen an&rsquo; honest an&rsquo;
  clean, an&rsquo; a wonder at your work. You never drank much, compared to
  most cowboys.... But your gun record was bad&mdash;forgive me, son, I
  don&rsquo;t want to offend. Remember I&rsquo;m your friend. Every old-timer
  here knows you never went around lookin&rsquo; for trouble. It&rsquo;s not
  that kind of a bad reputation. It&rsquo;s this kind. You&rsquo;ve spilled
  blood on this range, often, an&rsquo; more&rsquo;n once fatal. That made you
  loved by a few, feared an&rsquo; misunderstood by many, an&rsquo; a mark for
  every fame-huntin&rsquo; sheriff, gambler, an&rsquo; cowpuncher in the
  country. Now you&rsquo;re back again, after some years, an&rsquo; all you
  ever done here will come up. An&rsquo; your Texas doin&rsquo;s, whatever they
  were, will follow you.... Now the point I want to make is this: Preston knows
  most of this or will know it soon, an&rsquo; if he keeps you in his outfit it
  will be pretty strong proof that these queer dark hints from the range are
  without justification.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, it would seem so,&rdquo; replied Rock, meditatively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;ll be good if you find it that way. For Thiry&rsquo;s
  sake first, an&rsquo; then for everybody concerned. Then these hints against
  Preston will be little different from those concernin&rsquo; other ranchers.
  Most outfits have cowboys who brand calves an&rsquo; kill beeves they
  oughtn&rsquo;t to. That&rsquo;s common, an&rsquo; it don&rsquo;t count,
  because they about all do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock regarded his anxious friend a thoughtful moment. &ldquo;Winter,
  you&rsquo;ve made a point you weren&rsquo;t calculatin&rsquo; on.
  You&rsquo;re <i>hopin&rsquo;</i> I&rsquo;ll find Preston one of the common
  run of ranchers. But you&rsquo;re <i>afraid</i> I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was nearly noon the following day when Rock had his pack outfit ready
  for travel. Leslie came up presently with the white horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Black leather an&rsquo; silver trimmings,&rdquo; said the rancher,
  admiringly. &ldquo;Never seen him so dressed up. An&rsquo; the son-of-a-gun
  is smart enough to know he looks grand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s smart, all right,&rdquo; agreed Rock, with shining eyes.
  &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see if he&rsquo;ll hang me on the fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you can ride &rsquo;most anythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; observed
  Leslie, his appreciative glance running over Rock.</p>

  <p>The white horse took Rock&rsquo;s mount easily, pranced and champed a
  little, and tossed his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good day and good luck, rancher,&rdquo; said Rock, lifting the
  halter of the pack animal off a post.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Same to you, cowboy,&rdquo; replied Leslie, heartily. &ldquo;Reckon
  you don&rsquo;t need any advice about them hard nuts down in the
  Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Need it all right, but can&rsquo;t wait. When you see Sol tell him
  I&rsquo;m off fine and dandy,&rdquo; rejoined Rock.</p>

  <p>With that he headed down the road which the Prestons had taken the
  preceding day. Before Rock was far out of town he had ascertained his horse
  was a fast walker and had an easy trot. For speed and endurance, Leslie had
  committed himself to the claim that no horse in the country could approach
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hit the trail,&rdquo; sang out Rock, explosively, though
  it was a broad, well-trodden road that he was traveling.</p>

  <p>As many times as he had ridden out from Wagontongue and other towns, and
  from the innumerable range camps all over the West, not one of them had ever
  been like this venture. He laughed at himself. His boyhood had returned.
  There was nothing but good and joy in the world. The hot June sun pleasantly
  burned through his shirt sleeves; the dust tasted sweet; the wind, coming in
  puffs, brought the fragrant odors of the desert, spiced by a hint of sage;
  the hills slumbered in blue haze.</p>

  <p>Out of town a little way he caught up with a young rider who had evidently
  seen him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, cowboy!&rdquo; he greeted Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, yourself!&rdquo; returned Rock, genially.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I seen you was up on Leslie&rsquo;s white hoss, so I
  waited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know the horse?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore do. I ride for Spangler out here an&rsquo; we often had
  Leslie&rsquo;s stock to pasture.... Reckon you own the white now. You kinda
  have thet look.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I went broke buyin&rsquo; a horse to go with this
  saddle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you shore got two thet fit. You-all make a flash outfit....
  Where you ridin&rsquo;, cowboy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aimin&rsquo; for Sunset Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Got a job with Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope, not yet. I hope to land one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Easy, if you will stand long hours an&rsquo; poor wages. Preston
  pays less than any rancher hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; queried Rock, as if it was important.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forty, with promise of more. But no puncher ever sticks long enough
  to get more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean by easy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston is always hard up fer riders. Reckon he&rsquo;s only got a
  couple beside his sons. He asked me yestidday if I wanted a job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason no cowboy ever rides long for
  Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knowed you was a stranger round Wagontongue,&rdquo; said the
  other, grinning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I am, lately. But I was here years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before my time, shore. &rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;d remembered you.
  What&rsquo;s your handle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock, late of Texas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears to me I&rsquo;ve heerd that name, somewheres. Wal,
  I&rsquo;m glad to meet you. I&rsquo;m Hal Roberts. An&rsquo; if you
  don&rsquo;t tie up with Preston, come back an&rsquo; try Spangler.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock thanked him and asked questions about the range. Soon afterward the
  cowboy bade him good-by and turned off. Back from the road Rock espied a new
  ranch house and corrals that had not been there in his day. Then as he passed
  on he drew away from the dry-farming levels and the wastes of cut-over land,
  to get out into the desert proper. It waved away to the southward, gray and
  yellow, with spots of green cedars and dotted groups of cattle, on and on to
  a beckoning horizon line. Familiar landmarks stared at him, and grew in
  number and power to stir him, as he went on. His quick eye made especial note
  of improvements along the road. Stone culverts had been put in at some of the
  deeper washes.</p>

  <p>Rock kept looking for a cabin where he had stopped many a time. He could
  not recall the name of the homesteader who had located there. Coming to the
  top of a low rise of ground, he saw a little valley beyond, with a fringe of
  green. Then he found the cabin. It had been long deserted; the roof had
  fallen in, and the outside chimney of yellow stone had partly crumbled away.
  What had become of the homesteader and his hard-working wife and
  tousle-headed youngsters?</p>

  <p>Rock rode on. Further along he saw a dam of red earth that had been built
  in a depression, where in the rainy season water ran. A red, sun-baked,
  hoof-marked hollow glared there now. Cattle were few and far between. But
  this was barren desert. Some miles on, over the summit of this long slope,
  conditions would improve.</p>

  <p>In due time he reached the top and there halted the horses to spend a few
  moments in reveling in the well-remembered country.</p>

  <p>A thirty-mile gulf yawned wide and shallow, a yellow-green sea of desert
  grass and sage, which sloped into ridge on ridge of cedar and white grass.
  The length of the valley both east and west extended beyond the limit of
  vision, and here began the vast cattle range that made the town of
  Wagontongue possible. Rock&rsquo;s trained eye saw cattle everywhere, though
  not in large herds. It was a beautiful scene for any rider. Rock feasted his
  eyes, long used to the barrens of the Texas Panhandle. The rough country
  commenced some fifteen miles or more farther on. Sunset Pass and its environs
  were not in view, nor even the mountain ranges that were visible from the
  town.</p>

  <p>The valley smoked with the thick amber light of the warm June day. Lonely
  land! Rock&rsquo;s heart swelled. He was coming back to the valleys and hills
  that he now discovered he had loved.</p>

  <p>An hour&rsquo;s ride down the slow incline brought Rock into a verdant
  swale of fifty acres, fresh with its varied shades of green, surrounding a
  pretty ranch house. Here Adam Pringle had lived. If he were still there, he
  had verified his oft-repeated claims to Rock that here had been the making of
  a prosperous farm and cattle ranch.</p>

  <p>The barn and corrals were closer to the road than the house. Rock saw a
  boy leading a horse, then a man at work under an open shed. The big gate
  leading in was shut. Rock halloed. Whereupon the farmer started out
  leisurely, then quickened his steps. It was Adam&mdash;stalwart, middle-aged,
  weatherbeaten settler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True Rock, or I&rsquo;m a born sinner!&rdquo; shouted Pringle,
  before he was even near Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Adam! How&rsquo;s the old-timer?&rdquo; returned Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knowed that hoss. An&rsquo; I shore knowed you jest from the way
  you straddled him. How air you? This is plumb a surprise. Get down an&rsquo;
  come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t time, Adam. I&rsquo;m rustlin&rsquo; along to make
  camp below.... Adam, you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; good. I see you&rsquo;ve made
  this homestead go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never seen you look any better, if I remember. Thet&rsquo;s a hoss
  an&rsquo; saddle you&rsquo;re ridin&rsquo;. You always was hell on them. Whar
  you been?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Texas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you heerd aboot Cass Seward bein&rsquo; popped off,
  an&rsquo; you ride back to the old stampin&rsquo;-grounds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Adam, I didn&rsquo;t know Cass was dead till I got to Wagontongue.
  Guess I was homesick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whar you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sunset Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, if you want work, pile right off heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Adam, but I&rsquo;ve got a hankerin&rsquo; for wilder
  country. I&rsquo;ll try Preston. Think he&rsquo;ll take me on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. But don&rsquo;t ask him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m advisin&rsquo; you&mdash;not talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
  returned the rancher, with a sharp gleam in his eye. &ldquo;You know me,
  True.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Used to, pretty well, Adam. And I&rsquo;m sort of flustered at your
  advisin&rsquo; me that way,&rdquo; replied Rock, keenly searching the
  other&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay away from Sunset Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Adam, I just never could take advice,&rdquo; drawled Rock.
  &ldquo;Much obliged, though.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you may need a job bad, an&rsquo; you shore always hankered
  for wild range. But it ain&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you aimin&rsquo; at, Adam?&rdquo; asked Rock, with a
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t aimin&rsquo;, True. I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you.
  It&rsquo;s thet tow-headed lass of Preston&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, considerin&rsquo; we&rsquo;re old friends, I won&rsquo;t take
  offense,&rdquo; drawled Rock. &ldquo;How you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Been on my feet these two years,&rdquo; returned Pringle, with
  satisfaction. &ldquo;Been raisin&rsquo; turnips an&rsquo; potatoes an&rsquo;
  some corn. Got three thousand haid of stock. An&rsquo; sellin&rsquo; eight
  hundred haid this fall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bully! I&rsquo;m sure tickled. Losin&rsquo; much stock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some. But not enough to rave aboot. Though I&rsquo;m agreed with
  cattlemen who know the range that there&rsquo;s more rustlin&rsquo; than for
  some years past.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Queer rustlin&rsquo;, too. You lose a few haid of steers an&rsquo;
  then you never hear of anyone seein&rsquo; hide nor hair of them
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; queer about that, Adam. Rustled cattle are seldom
  seen again,&rdquo; returned Adam, for the sake of argument. But there was
  something unusual about it. Pringle, however, did not press the point.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many new cattlemen?&rdquo; went on Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not too many. The range is healthy an&rsquo;
  improvin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Jess Slagle? I used to ride for Jess, and want to see
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Didn&rsquo;t nobody tell you aboot Slagle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. And I forgot to ask. You see, I only got to town
  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jess Slagle couldn&rsquo;t make it go in Sunset Pass after the
  Prestons come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s sure big enough country for ten
  outfits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, there&rsquo;s only one left, an&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s
  Preston&rsquo;s. Ask Slagle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure will. Is he still located in the Pass?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s ten miles this side. Stone cabin. You&rsquo;ll
  remember it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I do, that&rsquo;s no ranch for Jess Slagle. Marshland, what
  there was of it fit to graze cattle, salty water, mostly rocks and
  cedars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your memory&rsquo;s good, Rock. Drop in to see Slagle. An&rsquo;
  don&rsquo;t miss callin&rsquo; heah when you come out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be so very long. Huh,
  Adam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m not thinkin&rsquo;, but if it was anyone else
  I&rsquo;d give him three days&mdash;aboot,&rdquo; replied Pringle, with a
  guffaw.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s misgivings grew in proportion to the increasing warmth and
  pleasure of this ride toward old haunts. The fact that nothing was spoken
  openly detrimental to the Prestons was a singular feature that he had
  encountered once or twice before. The real Westerner, such as Leslie or
  Pringle, was a man of few words. This reticence sprang from a consciousness
  that he was not wholly free from blame himself, and that to be loose with the
  tongue entailed considerable risk. Rock could not prevent his growing
  curiosity and interest, but he succeeded in inhibiting any suspicions. He
  wanted to believe that Thiry&rsquo;s people, including the redoubtable Ash,
  were the very salt of the earth.</p>

  <p>Toward sundown he reached the south slope of the valley and entered the
  zone of the cedars. These gray-sheathed trees, fragrant, with their massed
  green foliage and grotesque dead branches, seemed as much a part of a
  cowboy&rsquo;s life as grass or rocks or cactus. Rock halted for camp near a
  rugged little creek, where clear water ran trickling over the stones. He went
  off the road and threw his pack in a clump of cedars where he could not
  readily be seen. How long since he had camped in the open, as in his earlier
  days on the range!</p>

  <p>Then he unsaddled the white, and hobbled both horses, and watched them
  thump out in search of grass. He unrolled his tarp under a low-branching
  cedar, and opened his pack, conscious of pleasurable sensations. It had been
  years since he had done this sort of thing. In Texas he had ridden out from a
  comfortable house, and back again, sooner or later, as he liked. But this was
  the real life for a rider. When the dead cedar branches burst into a
  crackling fire he seemed magically to find his old dexterity at camp tasks.
  And the hour flew by.</p>

  <p>After sunset, sky and cloud and valley were illumined by a golden ethereal
  light. Twilight stole from some invisible source, and night followed, a
  mellow warm summer night, with hum of insects and croak of frogs, and the
  melancholy music a cowboy found inseparable from his lonely vigil&mdash;the
  staccato cry of coyotes. Rock lingered beside his dying red cedar fire,
  listening, feeling, realizing that the years had brought him much until now
  never divined, and that something as mystical in the future called to his
  being. Not by chance merely, nor because of a longing to return to this
  range, nor impelled by the restless wanderlust of a cowboy, had he journeyed
  hither. Around every thought, almost, seemed to hover the intangible shadow
  of Thiry Preston. But he would not make of her a deliberate object of
  conjecture, of reality. That would come later, when he had found her again,
  and understood himself.</p>

  <p>The night darkened, the air cooled, the camp fire flickered out. Rock
  crawled into his blankets under the widespread cedar. The soft feel of wool,
  the hard ground, the smell of cedar, the twinkle of a star through the
  branches, the moan of rising night wind, the lonesome coyote bark, and the
  silence&mdash;how good they were and how they recalled other days!</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Rock was awakened at dawn by the thump of hoofs. The white horse had come
  into camp, which was something horses seldom did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You early-risin&rsquo; son-of-a-gun,&rdquo; called Rock, as he
  rolled out of bed. &ldquo;Want your oats, huh? I just figured you&rsquo;d
  want a snookful of oats, so I fetched some.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was on his way before sunrise, and in an hour or so had reached Cedar
  Creek, with its green banks and clusters of trees, its little flat where
  stood a cabin new to Rock. It was locked. He could not see in. But in the
  sand before the door he saw little boot tracks that surely had been made by
  Thiry Preston. This was the halfway house used by the Prestons, going to and
  from town.</p>

  <p>From there the road circled a ridge to the west, and a well-defined trail
  led up the slope. Rock knew the trail, and believed that the road would come
  back to it over the hill. He took the short-cut, and almost it seemed that he
  had ridden the trail only yesterday.</p>

  <p>When he achieved the summit, the sky had become overcast with heavy white
  and black clouds, darkening the day. From here he gazed over into country
  that deserved its repute. Wide and far away it flung defiance, menace, and
  call to the long-absent rider. Below him spread a white-and-green
  checkerboard of grass and cedar, leading with striking boldness up into
  leagues and leagues of black timber, mesas with crowned walls of gray
  limestone, cliffs of red rock, fringed by pine, all mere steps up to the
  mountain kingdom into which the great gap of Sunset Pass yawned, purple and
  dim and forbidding.</p>

  <p>About noon Rock halted before the stone cabin that he knew must belong to
  his old friend and employer, Jess Slagle. Rock rode into what was a sorry
  excuse for a yard, where fences were down and dilapidated wagons, long out of
  use, stood around amid a litter of stones and wood, and all kinds of débris
  characteristic of a run-down range. The corral in the back was a makeshift,
  and the log barn would have shamed a poor homesteader. It amazed and shocked
  Rock, though he had seen many cattlemen start well and never finish.</p>

  <p>Dismounting, Rock went to the door and knocked. He heard steps inside. The
  door opened half a foot to disclose a red-haired, homely woman, in dirty
  garb, more like a sack than a dress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does Jess Slagle live here?&rdquo; asked Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s out round the barn somewheres,&rdquo; she replied,
  with a swift flash of beady eyes that took him in.</p>

  <p>As Rock thanked her and turned away he saw that she was barefooted. So
  Jess Slagle had come to squalor and poverty. Who was the woman? Rock
  certainly had no remembrance of her. Presently he heard the sound of hammer
  or ax blows on wood, and he came upon Slagle at work on a pen beside the
  barn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Rock! I knew you were in town. Range Preston rode by this
  mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo; passed the news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This gaunt man was Slagle, changed vastly, no doubt like his fortunes. He
  showed no surprise or gladness. The grasp of his hand was rough, hard, but
  lacked warmth or response. Rock remembered him as a heavy, florid Westerner,
  with clear eyes, breezy manner, smooth of face, and without a gray hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jess, I&rsquo;m sure surprised and plumb sorry to find
  you&mdash;your condition so&mdash;so different,&rdquo; began Rock, a little
  uncertain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s natural. Not much like when you rode for me,
  years ago,&rdquo; replied Slagle, with the bitterness of the defeated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What happened, Jess?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About everythin&rsquo;, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheeped off the range?&rdquo; went on Rock, hazarding a query.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell no! There&rsquo;s no sheep on this side, an&rsquo; never will
  be, so long as Preston lives.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you lose out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Rock, I had hard luck. Two bad years for water and grass.
  Then Dabb shut down on me. I held the little end of a deal with him. Next I
  sold some cattle, put the money in a bank, an&rsquo; it busted. Then Preston
  moved into the country&mdash;an&rsquo; here I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How in the devil did you get here?&rdquo; demanded Rock, bluntly,
  spreading his hands significantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right off I made a mistake,&rdquo; returned Slagle, nodding his
  head. &ldquo;Preston was keen about my ranch in the Pass. He made me a good
  offer. I refused. He kept after me. I had some hard words with his son, Ash,
  an&rsquo; it all led to a breach. They kept edgin&rsquo; my stock down out of
  the Pass an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t have the riders to drive it back. That way,
  then, an&rsquo; in others I fell more in debt. No banks would give me credit.
  An&rsquo; as I said before, here I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough story, Jess. I&rsquo;m sorry. But it
  doesn&rsquo;t explain how you lost your ranch in the Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell you, I had finally to sell for about
  nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. No one on the lower range would take it as a gift. It was a
  poor location, if any other outfit rode the Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh! Then as it stands, Preston about ruined you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Rock, I couldn&rsquo;t claim that. My deal with Dabb hurt me
  most&mdash;started me downhill. Gage Preston never did me any dirt that I
  actually know. When I went to him an&rsquo; told him his outfit was
  drivin&rsquo; my stock off grass an&rsquo; water, he raised the very old Ned
  with his sons, in particular Ash Preston, who&rsquo;s sure rotten enough to
  taint the whole other twelve Prestons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So this Ash Preston <i>is</i> rotten?&rdquo; queried Rock,
  deliberately, glad to find one man not afraid to voice his convictions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I don&rsquo;t talk behind any cattleman&rsquo;s back,&rdquo;
  returned Slagle, forcefully. &ldquo;I told Gage Preston this, an&rsquo; I
  told Ash to his face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the old man stalled off a shootin&rsquo; match, I
  reckon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever met since?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lots of times. But I&rsquo;ve never had the nerve to draw on Ash. I
  know he&rsquo;d kill me. He knows it, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean by rotten?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;s a poor word. But I know what I mean. Did you ever
  see a slick, cold, shiny rattlesnake, just after sheddin&rsquo; his skin,
  come slippin&rsquo; out, no more afraid of you than hell, sure of himself,
  an&rsquo; ready to sting you deep?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I have, Jess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s Ash Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh! And that&rsquo;s all you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it is, Rock. I&rsquo;ve lost cattle the last five years,
  some hundreds in all. But so has Preston an&rsquo; other ranchers, all the
  way from Red Butte to the sand. There&rsquo;s rustlin&rsquo;, more perhaps
  than when you helped us clean out the Hartwell outfit. But sure as I am alive
  I never laid any of it to Ash Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, studying the other&rsquo;s mask-like
  face. &ldquo;Glad to get your angle. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ask Preston for
  a job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had a hunch you were. I&rsquo;m wishin&rsquo; you
  luck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walk out with me and see my horse, Jess,&rdquo; rejoined Rock,
  turning. &ldquo;Do you aim to hang on here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank God, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Slagle, with a first show
  of feeling. &ldquo;My wife&mdash;she&rsquo;s my second wife, by the
  way&mdash;has had a little money an&rsquo; a farm left her, in Missouri.
  We&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; before Winter sets in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you&rsquo;ve had a windfall, Jess.... Now what do you
  think of that white horse?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Rock had been two hours leisurely climbing the imperceptible slope up to
  the mouth of Sunset Pass. It was mid-afternoon. The clouds had broken
  somewhat and already there were tinges of gold and purple against the blue
  sky.</p>

  <p>At last he entered the wide portal of the Pass, and had clear view of its
  magnificent reach and bold wild beauty. The winding Sunset Creek came down
  like a broken ribbon, bright here and dark there, to crawl at last into a
  gorge on Rock&rsquo;s left. The sentinel pines seemed to greet him. They
  stood as he remembered, first one, isolated and stately, then another, and
  next two, and again one, and so on that way until at the height of the Pass
  they grew in numbers, yet apart, lording it over the few cedars on the level
  bench, and the log cabins strange to Rock, that he knew must be the home of
  the Prestons.</p>

  <p>Many and many a time had he camped there, realizing and loving the beauty
  of that lovely aloof spot, yet never had he imagined it as a site for a
  ranch. But it was indeed the most perfect situation of any he had ever seen.
  And it was Thiry Preston&rsquo;s home.</p>

  <p>Rock was still a mile or more distant. Slowly he approached, holding in
  the white horse that scented water and grass. The ascent here was gradual, as
  was the constriction of the Pass. The breath of sage blew strong, sweet,
  heavy on the breeze that came through from the west. Already the sun hung
  low, directly in the center of the great V-shaped gap which appeared to split
  the very heart of the mountain range. And the gold was growing vivid.
  Preston&rsquo;s ranch, at least the six cabins, occupied the divide, which
  hid the lower and the larger end of the Pass from Rock&rsquo;s eager gaze. He
  remembered it so well that he could scarcely wait.</p>

  <p>Slowly he rode up and entered the beautiful open park. It was just
  naturally beautiful, level, with white grass surrounding the patches of brown
  mats of needles under the pines. The road cut through the center and went
  down the other side. Rock had a glimpse of gardens, corrals, fields, and then
  the purple pass threaded with winding white.</p>

  <p>There were no rocks, no brush, no fallen logs or dead timber. The few
  cedars and piñons and pines stood far apart, as if distributed by a mighty
  landscape artist. Some of the cabins were weathered and gray, with more green
  on the split shingles. They had wide eaves and sturdy gray chimneys built
  outside, and glass windows. Other cabins were new, especially a little one,
  far over under the overhanging green slope and near a thin pile of white
  water falling from mossy rock. The largest of the pines marked this little
  cabin, and towered over it protectingly. The only living things in sight were
  two deer, standing with long ears erect, a horse and a colt, and a
  jack-rabbit, bounding away across the waving grass.</p>

  <p>Just then a hound bayed, deep and hollow, no doubt announcing the advent
  of a stranger in the Pass. Rock, having come abreast of the first cabin,
  halted his horse.</p>

  <p>The door of this cabin opened. A tall, lithe, belted and booted man
  stalked out, leisurely, his eagle-like head bare, his yellow hair waving in
  the wind&mdash;Ash Preston.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">ROCK felt that seldom indeed had he been looked over as he
  now was by this Ash Preston. No hint of recognition in that live blue
  gaze!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, stranger! Are you off the trail?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The omission of the invariable Western &ldquo;Get down and come in,&rdquo;
  was not lost on Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy to you!&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Is this Gage
  Preston&rsquo;s ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m on the right track. I want to see him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you, stranger?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Trueman Rock, late of Texas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock.... Are you the Rock who used to ride here before we
  came?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ash Preston measured Rock again, a long penetrating look that was neither
  insolent nor curious, but which added something to his first impression. It
  was impossible to tell what he thought. He was hard to reach, aloof and cold.
  Like every meeting Rock ever had with anyone, this one made its own reaction.
  He could not be other than himself, even though most desirous of being
  agreeable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can tell me what you want with Preston. I&rsquo;m his son
  Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you,&rdquo; said Rock, pleasantly, and that was true,
  even if he had to feign the pleasure. &ldquo;Do you run Preston&rsquo;s
  business?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m foreman here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon my call&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; important,&rdquo; returned
  Rock, easily. &ldquo;But when I do call on a cattleman I want to see
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you shore it&rsquo;s my father you want to see most?&rdquo;
  asked Ash, without the slightest change in tone or expression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m callin&rsquo; on Miss Thiry, too, for that
  matter,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, with a laugh. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to see
  your father first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>According to Western custom it was natural and courteous for a rider to
  call upon any rancher, if he chose to; and in most cases he would be received
  hospitably. And it was permissible for him to pay his respects to a young
  unmarried woman. Rock let it be assumed that there was no reason why the
  Prestons of Sunset Pass were any different from other Western people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Thiry ain&rsquo;t seein&rsquo; every rider who comes
  along,&rdquo; said Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? Well, that&rsquo;s unlucky for some,&rdquo; rejoined Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; dad ain&rsquo;t home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That would have made the matter conclusive for most men confronting Ash
  Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean <i>you</i> say he isn&rsquo;t home to <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
  queried Rock, deliberately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to take it that way, but since you
  do we&rsquo;ll let it go at that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here was the first hitch in the situation. It had to be met. Rock accepted
  the inevitable. Harmony, let alone even agreeable acquaintance, was utterly
  impossible between Preston and himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Preston, if I can&rsquo;t let it go at that,&rdquo; he
  returned, coolly. &ldquo;Would you mind tellin&rsquo; me if any of the other
  ten Prestons are home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There the gauntlet went in the face of Ash Preston. Still he did not show
  surprise. The intense blue of his eyes, steady on Rock, changed only with a
  flare. Whatever he might be when drunk, when sober as now, he was slow, cold,
  complex, cunning. He was flint, singularly charged with fire. Rock would have
  felt easier in mind if Preston had shown less strength and perception. But he
  gave Rock the same status that Rock gave him. It augured ill for the
  future.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock, all the Prestons are home, if you&rsquo;re so set on
  knowin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned Ash. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one of the
  thirteen who&rsquo;s advisin&rsquo; you to dust down the road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon that must be you, Mister Ash?&rdquo; inquired Rock,
  nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s shore me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t know you. And sure you
  don&rsquo;t know me. I can&rsquo;t ever have offended you. Why are you so
  uncivil?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston&rsquo;s glance, straying over Rock, and the flashy saddle and
  beautiful horse, betrayed something akin to disfavor, but he did not commit
  himself further than to make a slight gesture, indicating the road down the
  Pass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Plain as print,&rdquo; went on Rock, bluntly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
  not takin&rsquo; your hunch, Ash Preston. I&rsquo;ll stay long enough,
  anyhow, to see if the rest of your family is as rude to a stranger as you
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In one sliding step Rock reached the ground. And at that instant heavy
  boots crunched the gravel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Ash, who&rsquo;re you palaverin&rsquo; with?&rdquo; called a
  deep, hearty voice.</p>

  <p>Ash wheeled on his heel, as on an oiled pivot, and without answer strode
  back into the cabin, to slam the door. Then Rock turned to see who had
  intervened so timely. He saw a man of massive build, in the plain garb of an
  everyday cattleman. Rock perceived at once that he was father to Thiry and
  Range Preston, but there seemed no resemblance to Ash. He might have been
  fifty years old. Handsome in a bold way, he had a smooth hard face, bulging
  chin, well-formed large lips, just now stained by tobacco, and great deep
  gray eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stranger, I reckon Ash wasn&rsquo;t welcomin&rsquo; you with open
  arms,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly.... You&rsquo;re Gage Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore am, young man. Did you want to see me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I asked for you. He said you weren&rsquo;t home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doggone Ash, anyhow,&rdquo; replied the rancher, with impatient
  good-humor. &ldquo;Whenever a cowpuncher rides in hyar, Ash tells him
  we&rsquo;ve got smallpox or such like. He&rsquo;s not sociable. But you
  mustn&rsquo;t judge us other Prestons by him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was tryin&rsquo; to argue with him on that very chance,&rdquo;
  said Rock, smilingly. It required only a glance to define Gage Preston as the
  type of Westerner Rock liked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope Ash didn&rsquo;t take you for a hoss thief. Course he knowed
  Leslie&rsquo;s white hoss. We seen him only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, your son didn&rsquo;t say. But I reckon he thought so. I
  bought this horse from Leslie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grand hoss he is, you lucky rider,&rdquo; replied Preston, with a
  huge hand on the white flank. &ldquo;Hyar, Tom,&rdquo; he called, turning
  toward a lanky youth in the background, &ldquo;take these hosses. Throw
  saddle an&rsquo; pack on the porch of the empty cabin.... Wal, stranger,
  you&rsquo;re down, so come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock had not noticed that the next cabin, some distance away under the
  pines, was a double one of the picturesque kind, long, with wide eaves, a
  porch all around, and ample space between the two log structures. Water ran
  down from the stream, in a chute hollowed from saplings. This house was one
  of the older ones, which had become weathered, with roof greened over with
  moss. The nearer cabin had two doors and a window that Rock could see.
  Evidently the second cabin was a kitchen. But both had large stone chimneys.
  Deer and elk antlers, saddles and skins, hung on the walls between the
  cabins. Table and benches there indicated where the Prestons dined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;ll be pleasanter sittin&rsquo; outside,&rdquo; said
  Preston, and invited Rock to a rustic seat under the trees.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say your name was?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;yet,&rdquo; laughed Rock. He liked
  Preston, and could not help but compare the son most disparagingly with the
  father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry didn&rsquo;t tell me either,&rdquo; went on the rancher.
  &ldquo;But I know you&rsquo;re the young fellar who was polite to her
  an&rsquo; did somethin&rsquo; or other for her thet made Ash
  huffy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. It wasn&rsquo;t much, certainly nothin&rsquo; to offend
  Miss Thiry&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Ash was drunk. An&rsquo; he shore ain&rsquo;t no credit to us
  then. Range, the other boy who saw you, said you was pretty decent. Thet you
  only stuck out your foot fer Ash to tumble over. I reckon he didn&rsquo;t
  need thet to take a dislike to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t recognize me, I&rsquo;m glad to say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young man, I&rsquo;ll say you didn&rsquo;t lose any time
  trailin&rsquo; Thiry up,&rdquo; went on Preston, quizzically, with a twinkle
  in his big gray eyes. &ldquo;Shore you must be one of them sudden
  fellars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Preston, you&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Rock,
  somewhat disconcerted, more from the rancher&rsquo;s genial acceptance of a
  fact than from being discovered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t lie about it. Lord knows this hyar has happened a
  hundred times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to lie, Mr. Preston,&rdquo; went on
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me mister. Make it plain Preston, an&rsquo; Gage
  when you feel acquainted enough. You&rsquo;re not tryin&rsquo; to tell me you
  didn&rsquo;t foller Thiry out hyar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not exactly. Now you make me think&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid
  it must be&mdash;somethin&rsquo; like that. But I came to ask you for a
  job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. What&rsquo;ll you work fer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon the same as you pay any other rider. I&rsquo;m an old hand
  with ropes, horses, cattle&mdash;anythin&rsquo; about the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;re hired. I&rsquo;m shore in need of a man who can
  handle the boys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Preston, you don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll put me to
  handlin&rsquo; Ash! He said he was foreman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I run two outfits. Ash bosses the older riders. If you fit in with
  the youngsters it&rsquo;ll shore be a load off my mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That suits me fine. I reckon I can hold up the job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you strike me all right. But I gotta tell you thet no young
  man I ever hired struck Ash right. An&rsquo; none of them ever
  lasted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; inquired Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you seen Ash an&rsquo; you ask me thet?&rdquo; exclaimed
  Preston, spreading his big hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, if I turn out to be of value to you, will <i>you</i> want
  me to last?&rdquo; queried Rock, and this was the straight language of one
  Westerner to another. Preston appeared to be confronted with a most pertinent
  question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo; parried Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not quite broke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jest a poor cowpuncher with your fortune tied up in hoss an&rsquo;
  saddle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s about the size of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How aboot red eye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, I used to drink a little, now and then. But I&rsquo;ve
  quit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fer good?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe so. I never quit before. But I&rsquo;m not a man to go
  back on my word. And I promise you I&rsquo;ll never drink while ridin&rsquo;
  for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I like your talk an&rsquo; I like your looks. An&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;ll say if you can handle my boys an&rsquo; stick it out in the face
  of Ash, I&rsquo;ll be some in your debt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Ash, of course. But I can take a hunch, if
  you&rsquo;ll give it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Ash sees red whenever any puncher looks at Thiry. He cares fer
  nothin&rsquo; on earth but thet girl. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s awful fond of
  him. She&rsquo;s never had a beau. An&rsquo; Thiry&rsquo;s near
  twenty-two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens! Is her brother so jealous he won&rsquo;t let any man
  look at her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he wouldn&rsquo;t if he could prevent it&mdash;thet&rsquo;s
  daid shore. An&rsquo; far as the ranch hyar is concerned he does prevent. But
  when Thiry goes to town accidents happen, like you meetin&rsquo; up with her.
  Thet riles Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case, Preston, I&rsquo;m afraid Ash will get riled out
  here. For I reckon the same kind of accident may happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hum! Hum! You&rsquo;re a cool hand to draw to,&rdquo; exploded the
  rancher, boisterously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say your name was?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you yet. It&rsquo;s Trueman Rock, late of
  Texas. But I used to ride here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rancher apparently met with instant check to his mood.
  &ldquo;What?...Trueman Rock!&mdash;Are you thet there True Rock who figgered
  in gun-play hyar years ago?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t deny it, Preston,&rdquo; replied Rock, his
  steady glance on the gray thought-clouding eyes of the rancher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You rode fer Slagle&mdash;when he had his ranch down hyar below in
  the Pass?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two years I was with Slagle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Also the Cross Bar outfit, the Circle X? An&rsquo; once you was
  with John Dabb?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure you have me pat, Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was you who run down thet Hartwell rustlin&rsquo;
  outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take all the credit. But I was there when it
  happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, man, I&rsquo;ve heerd aboot you all these years. Damn funny I
  didn&rsquo;t savvy who you were.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been six years since I left here&mdash;and perhaps you
  heard some things not quite fair to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never heerd a word thet I&rsquo;d hold against you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then my job stands, in spite of my bein&rsquo; True Rock?&rdquo;
  asked Rock, eagerly. What a vast importance seemed to hang on this!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, why&rsquo;n hell didn&rsquo;t you yell who you was fust
  off?&rdquo; retorted Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;and I guess I&rsquo;ve always been a
  little backward about my name, at least.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston had undergone further subtle change that to Rock&rsquo;s quick
  intelligence indicated he was finding favor with the rancher. Something of
  Preston&rsquo;s pondering speculation might have had to do with the
  future.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, shore you couldn&rsquo;t know thet when you killed
  Pickins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t dig up my past,&rdquo;
  interrupted Rock, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell, man! You&rsquo;re listenin&rsquo; to Gage Preston. An&rsquo;
  he&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to tell you how you once did him a good
  turn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, even if I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll tell you some other time,&rdquo; rejoined Preston,
  evidently relieved to be checked in his impulsive speech. &ldquo;Come now,
  an&rsquo; meet these hyar eleven other Prestons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock faced the ordeal with mingled emotions, chiefly concerning Thiry, but
  with nothing of the inhibition he had labored under while encountering Ash.
  Thiry, however, to his keen disappointment, was not one of the half dozen
  Prestons who answered the rancher&rsquo;s cheery call.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Preston appeared a worthy mate for this virile cattleman. She was
  buxom and comely, fair like all of them, and some years younger than
  Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ma, this is Trueman Rock, who&rsquo;s come to ride fer me,&rdquo;
  announced Preston. Then he presented Rock to Alice, a girl of sixteen, not by
  any means lacking the good looks that appeared to run in the family. She was
  shy, but curious and friendly. Rock took instantly to the ragged, barefooted,
  big-eyed children, Lucy and Burr; and signs were not wholly wanting that they
  were going to like him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Thiry?&rdquo; asked the rancher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ironin&rsquo;, Dad,&rdquo; replied Alice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, didn&rsquo;t she hyar me call?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon she did, Pa, for you&rsquo;d &rsquo;most woke the
  daid,&rdquo; replied his wife, and going to the door of the second cabin she
  called, &ldquo;Thiry, we&rsquo;ve company, an&rsquo; Pa wants you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock caught a low protesting voice that came from inside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, daughter,&rdquo; replied the mother. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t look so awful. Anyway, you can&rsquo;t get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Thiry appeared in the door in a long blue apron that scarcely
  hid her graceful symmetry. Her sleeves were rolled up to the elbow of shapely
  arms. She came out reluctantly, with troubled eyes and a little frown. She
  showed no surprise. She had seen him through the window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Preston,&rdquo; greeted Trueman, evincing but
  little of the pleasure that consumed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Mr. Rock, our new grocery clerk,&rdquo; she
  responded, with manner and tone that was a little beyond Trueman. &ldquo;How
  do you do! And aren&rsquo;t you lost way out here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I was, but there&rsquo;s hope of me gettin&rsquo; back in
  the trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Rock, what&rsquo;s thet aboot you bein&rsquo; a grocery clerk?
  I reckoned I was hirin&rsquo; a cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Rock had to explain that he had been keeping store for Sol
  Winter when Thiry happened in. Thiry did not share in the laughter. Rock
  thought he saw the gray eyes quicken and darken as she glanced swiftly from
  him to her father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to handle the boys,&rdquo; replied
  Preston, as if in answer to a mute query.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a&mdash;a cowboy, then,&rdquo; she said to Rock, struggling
  to hide confusion or concern. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the job
  you&rsquo;ve undertaken.... What did my brother Ash say?&mdash;I saw you
  talking with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was tellin&rsquo; me your dad would sure give me a job.... And
  that you&rsquo;d be glad,&rdquo; replied Trueman, with the most smiling and
  disarming assurance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he was,&rdquo; retorted Thiry, blushing at the general
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Miss Preston,&rdquo; returned Rock, ruefully.
  &ldquo;Your brother was not&mdash;well, quite taken with my visit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He told me you didn&rsquo;t see every rider who came along. And
  that your father was not home. And that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We apologize for Ash&rsquo;s rudeness,&rdquo; interposed Thiry,
  hurriedly. She had not been able to meet Rock&rsquo;s gaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Rock. It&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to be hurt aboot,&rdquo;
  added Preston. &ldquo;Ash is a queer, unsociable feller. But you&rsquo;re
  shore welcome to the rest of us.... Thiry, if you never heerd of True Rock, I
  want to tell you he&rsquo;s been one of the greatest riders of this range.
  An&rsquo; I need him bad, in more ways than one. An&rsquo; I can tell you
  somethin&rsquo; thet&rsquo;d make you glad he happened along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;I&mdash;of course
  I&rsquo;m glad if you are,&rdquo; she returned, hurriedly. &ldquo;Please
  excuse me now. I&rsquo;ve so much work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Somehow Trueman divined that she was not glad; or if she were, it was
  owing to her father&rsquo;s need, and then it was not whole-hearted. The
  knowledge fell upon him with unaccountable dismay, so much so that he could
  scarcely conceal it. But the youngsters saved him this time. They sidled over
  to him and began to ply him with questions about the white horse, which had
  captivated their eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you call him?&rdquo; asked Burr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is I haven&rsquo;t named him yet,&rdquo; replied
  Rock, surprised at the omission. &ldquo;Can you think of a good
  one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Call him Whiteface or Longmane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so bad. What do you say, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I like what Thiry calls him,&rdquo; she said, shyly. &ldquo;Oh,
  we&rsquo;ve seen him often. I was once on his back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your sister has a name for him? Well, that&rsquo;s nice. Tell me.
  Maybe I&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; said Trueman, with a feeling of
  duplicity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; announced Lucy, impressively. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
  just grand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Egypt?&mdash;Oh, I see. Because he&rsquo;s like one of the white
  stallions of the Arabians. I think it&rsquo;s pretty good.... We&rsquo;ll
  call him Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll tickle Thiry. I&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; cried the
  child, joyously, running into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Rock contrived, while letting Burr drag him round to look at the antlers
  of deer and elk, to catch a glimpse of Thiry at her work. She was alone in
  there, for Lucy had come running out. Rock thought she looked very sweet and
  domestic and capable. On the way back round the porch he stopped a moment to
  have another glimpse. This time she glanced up and caught him. Rock essayed
  to smile and pass on, to make his action seem casual. But her gaze held him
  stock-still, and it was certain he could not find a ready smile. She ceased
  her ironing and transfixed him with great eyes of wonder and reproach, almost
  resentment. She accused him, she blamed him for coming. He had brought her
  more trouble. Rock was so roused that he forgot himself and returned her look
  with all the amaze and entreaty he felt. Then the paleness of her face seemed
  suddenly blotted out; hastily she bent again to her work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, Rock, let me show you the ranch,&rdquo; called Preston.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re shore some proud of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be. I&rsquo;ve seen a sight of ranches, but this one
  is the finest,&rdquo; returned Rock, as he left the porch. &ldquo;Slagle once
  told me he didn&rsquo;t build here because he thought it&rsquo;d be cold and
  windy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! I had the same idee. But I found out thet the wind blows only
  in summer, when you want it. Fall an&rsquo; winter this high saddle is
  protected. Prevailin&rsquo; winds from the north.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pa, soon as Thiry&rsquo;s done we&rsquo;ll have supper, so
  don&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; spoke up Mrs. Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Ma. I reckon Rock couldn&rsquo;t be driv very
  far,&rdquo; replied the rancher, drawing Rock away. &ldquo;When we first come
  hyar, aboot five years ago, Slagle, as you know, lived down below. He
  wouldn&rsquo;t sell, an&rsquo; he swore this divide was on his land. But it
  wasn&rsquo;t, because he&rsquo;d homesteaded a hundred an&rsquo; sixty acres,
  an&rsquo; his land didn&rsquo;t come halfway up. Wal, we throwed up a big
  cabin, an&rsquo; we all lived in it fer a while. The kids were pretty small
  then. Next I tore thet cabin down an&rsquo; built the double one, an&rsquo;
  this one hyar, which Ash has to himself. He won&rsquo;t sleep with nobody.
  Lately we throwed up four more, an&rsquo; now we&rsquo;re shore
  comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The little cabin over by the creek under the largest of the pines was
  occupied by Alice and Thiry, and they, according to Preston, had just about
  put that cabin up themselves. But Rock&rsquo;s quick eye gathered at once
  that Preston or some one of his sons was something of an architect and a most
  efficient carpenter. Except the two large cabins, nearest the road, the
  others were some distance apart. The small empty cabin, where Rock&rsquo;s
  packs had been left, was off among the trees fully a hundred yards; the next,
  where Preston&rsquo;s sons, Tom, Albert and Harry, lived, appeared an equal
  distance farther, and the last, occupied by Range Preston, and some of the
  other boys, stood close under the north slope of the Pass.</p>

  <p>The grassy divide sloped gradually to the west, and down below the level,
  where cedars grew thicker and the pines thinned out, were the corrals and
  barns and open sheds, substantial and well built. Another log chute brought
  running water from the hill. Rock found his white horse in one of the
  corrals, surrounded by three lanky youths from sixteen to twenty years old.
  Preston introduced them as the inseparable three, Tom, Albert, and Harry.
  They had the Preston fairness, and Tom and Harry were twins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, if you can tell which is Tom an&rsquo; which is Harry,
  you&rsquo;ll do more&rsquo;n anyone outside the family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son-of-a-gun if I can tell now, lookin&rsquo; right at them,&rdquo;
  ejaculated Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, I&rsquo;ve hired Rock to ride with you, an&rsquo; reckon
  you&rsquo;ll get along,&rdquo; said Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like my horse?&rdquo; asked Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By gum! he&rsquo;s the only hoss I ever seen thet gave me the
  feelin&rsquo;s of a hoss thief,&rdquo; vouchsafed Albert Preston. The twins
  admired Egypt in silence.</p>

  <p>The barns were stuffed full of hay and fodder, some of it freshly cut. A
  huge bin showed a reserve of last year&rsquo;s corn. Wagons and harnesses
  were new; a row of saddles hung opposite a dozen stalls, where the Prestons
  no doubt kept their best horses. But these were empty now. A long fenced lane
  ran down to pastures. Horses were whistling down there, cows mooing, calves
  bawling. The whole environment reeked with the heady odor of stock, hay, and
  manure.</p>

  <p>Both money and labor had been lavished on this ranch; and it was something
  to open the eyes of old-time homesteaders like Slagle. Even prosperity would
  not have induced Slagle to such extremes of improvement. But then, Rock
  reflected, Preston must be a hard worker, and he had seven stalwart sons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, if I owned this ranch I&rsquo;d never leave it a single
  day,&rdquo; was Rock&rsquo;s eloquent encomium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;d shore hate to leave it myself,&rdquo; returned the
  other, tersely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many cattle have you?&rdquo; queried Rock, because he knew this
  was a natural question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have much idee. Ten thousand haid, Ash says. We run
  three herds, the small one down on the Flats, another hyar in the Pass,
  an&rsquo; the third an&rsquo; big herd up in the Foothills.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally the third means the big job,&rdquo; said Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore will be for you boys. Thar&rsquo;s a lot of cattle over thar
  thet ain&rsquo;t mine. Ash said eighty thousand haid all told in the
  Foothills. But thet&rsquo;s his exaggerated figurin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee! So many? In my day half that number would have been a lot. But
  it&rsquo;s a big country. Who&rsquo;s in on that range beside you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thar&rsquo;s several heavy owners, like Dabb, Lincoln,
  Hesbitt, an&rsquo; then a slew of others, from homesteaders like Slagle
  an&rsquo; Pringle to two-bit cowpuncher rustlers. It&rsquo;s sort of a bad
  mess over thar. An&rsquo; some of the outfits haven&rsquo;t no use fer
  mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! That&rsquo;s old cowboy breed. You can&rsquo;t ever change it.
  ... I know Lincoln. But Hesbitt is a new one on me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he came in soon after me,&rdquo; replied Preston, shortly. His
  speech, to Rock&rsquo;s calculating perceptions, had lost heartiness and
  spontaneity. But Rock doubted that he would have observed this subtle little
  difference had he not come to Sunset Pass peculiarly stimulated by
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol Winter told me you&rsquo;d worked a new wrinkle on the
  range,&rdquo; went on Rock, matter-of-factly. &ldquo;Wholesale
  butcherin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Always did go in fer thet. Hyar in this country I first set in
  killin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sellin&rsquo; to local butchers. Then I got to
  shippin&rsquo; beef to other towns not far along the railroad. An&rsquo; all
  told I&rsquo;ve made it pay a little better than sellin&rsquo; on the
  hoof.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;s a heap harder work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We Prestons ain&rsquo;t afraid of work,&rdquo; said the rancher.
  &ldquo;But it takes some managin&rsquo; as well. I made a slaughter-house out
  of Slagle&rsquo;s place, an&rsquo; then we do some butcherin&rsquo; out on
  the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What stumps me, Preston, is how you get beef to town in any
  quantity,&rdquo; responded Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Easy for Missourians on these hard roads. We got big wagons
  an&rsquo; four-hoss teams. In hot summer we drive at night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re from Missouri,&rdquo; went on Rock, with geniality.
  &ldquo;I sort of figured you were. I once worked with an outfit of
  Missourians. They have a lingo of their own, somethin&rsquo; like Texans.
  Better educated, though.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My girl Thiry went to school till she was seventeen,&rdquo; Preston
  spoke with pride. &ldquo;But the rest of them had little schoolin&rsquo;
  &rsquo;cept what Thiry has taught them out hyar.... Wal, you&rsquo;ll want to
  unpack an&rsquo; wash up fer supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was just sunset when Rock came out of the cabin assigned him. Sitting
  down on the stone steps of the porch, he found there was an open place
  between the trees permitting unbroken view of the Pass.</p>

  <p>Here, striking him like an invisible force in the air, was the wild scene
  famous among riders all over the Southwest. For riders wandered from range to
  range, and round camp fires and while on guard or in the bunkhouses they were
  wont to tell about the outfits with whom they had ridden and the ranges they
  had known. Rock had been asked about Sunset Pass more than once while he was
  in Texas. He recalled how he had used to rave. Small wonder!</p>

  <p>From Preston&rsquo;s ranch the Pass spread into a wider stretch of grassy
  knolls tipped by cedars, and grassy flats dotted by cedars, and grassy ridges
  sloping like hog-backs down from the walls of gray and green. Ten miles and
  more of the most beautiful meadow and pasture land in the West! Dots and
  strings and bunches of cattle gave life to the scene. The mellow murmur of a
  stream came on the summer wind. Water was falling somewhere, and Rock had to
  search to find it, close under the right wall, fringed by green that was
  turning to gold.</p>

  <p>Beyond the grassy levels and mounds the Pass changed to a verdant floor,
  only here and there showing a glint of open parks, like lakes of gold set in
  a forest. The walls leaned away, less rugged and rocky. From the league-wide
  forested floor, then, the Pass restricted to one third that width and began
  its magnificent step by step, up and up, to open into the golden foothill
  country. The white stream fell and paused and fell and paused again, as if
  loath to plunge into the purple gorges. Magic lights of gold and lilac and
  rose, transparent as the rainbow, gathered strength, and spread from rays and
  streaks to a mantle that slowly dimmed the outlines of the lower reaches.</p>

  <p>Beyond and above the foothills yawned the western end of the
  Pass&mdash;the grand gap that split the mountain range and gave the
  felicitous name to this beautiful rent in the crust of the earth.</p>

  <p>The sun was setting in the notch, with broken clouds above, pearl and
  mauve and opal, with hearts of rose and edges of saffron. How intense the
  blue far above! How like yellow lightning low down near the sinking orb, that
  now slipped its blazing under side below the clouds! A colossal reflector of
  nature&mdash;the great stone slopes of the mountain, magnified the
  brilliance, the color, the glory. And what had been beautiful before now
  seemed transformed to enchanted realms beyond the earth. What pure gold
  burned on the winding high walls of rock! The royal purple hue of
  Pharaoh&rsquo;s raiment slanted down from the peaks, its source invisible, to
  vanish in the white fire-streaked gorges. Over the western wall, between its
  end and the foothills, now mystic and dim, poured a medium like transparent
  lilac water. It moved. It flashed and glinted, as if falling stars shot
  through it down to the depths of amethyst. And every second there was change,
  until the blazing sun slid below the notch, and as swiftly the color and
  beauty and glory faded, to show Sunset Pass only a wild, broken defile,
  shading to gray and black.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>A bell called Rock to supper. When he reached the cabin, to find the
  Preston boys straddling the benches, it was to be accosted by the
  rancher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, cowboy, when you hyar the supper bell you come
  a-r&rsquo;arin&rsquo;. Never wait for a second bell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you have to ring a second bell for me?&rdquo; queried Trueman,
  in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;or you&rsquo;d have missed your supper,&rdquo; returned
  Thiry. She was standing near where Preston sat at the head of the table. Her
  face seemed to catch the afterglow of sunset, and her eyes, too.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.... I&rsquo;m sorry to be late. I didn&rsquo;t hear. Guess I
  was lost in the sunset.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it wasn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s best tonight. Too much sun. You
  want more cloud, so you can see.... Rock, you set hyar on my right.
  Thet&rsquo;ll put you across from Thiry. Hope it doesn&rsquo;t spoil your
  appetite!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, instead of cracking jokes you should introduce Mr. Rock to the
  other boys,&rdquo; reproved Thiry, calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scuse me. Let&rsquo;s see. Are we all hyar?... Whar&rsquo;s
  Ash?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He rode off somewheres,&rdquo; replied one of the boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock, meet Range Preston, an&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s his real name
  ... an&rsquo; Scoot, which is short for some handle Ma gave him once...
  an&rsquo; Boots, whose proper name is Frank... Boys, this is Trueman
  Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston&rsquo;s humorous introduction, and Rock&rsquo;s friendly response,
  elicited only a &ldquo;howdy&rdquo; from each of these older sons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon we can eat now,&rdquo; added Preston. &ldquo;Set down, Rock,
  an&rsquo; pitch in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The long table was bountifully spread, steaming, savory. Mrs. Preston sat
  at the foot, with Lucy on one side and Burr on the other. Alice&rsquo;s place
  was next to Rock, and she most solicitously served him. The twins and Albert,
  with their silver hair wet and plastered back, sat next to Thiry, faces over
  their plates. The elder brothers occupied seats on the bench beyond Alice.
  There was hardly any unnecessary conversation. The male contingent, Rock
  observed, devoted themselves to the supper, like any other hungry cowboys.
  Presently Rock stole a glance at Thiry, to catch her eyes on him. That made
  him so happy he did not dare risk another. But he could see her plate, and
  that the food on it diminished slowly. She was not hungry. His coming to
  Sunset Pass had unaccountably troubled her. It puzzled and annoyed Rock. It
  was far from flattering. He was not such a cad that he would impose himself
  upon a girl who disliked him on first sight. But Rock could not believe that
  could be wholly true. What had he done to deserve that? If he had been rude
  or bold that day of the meeting in Winter&rsquo;s store, he could understand.
  But he had only been full of fun&mdash;he could not remember saying anything
  to which Thiry could take exception, unless it was that silly remark about
  the spilled rice being an omen. So his mind ran, and the remainder of the
  supper was not a satisfaction to him.</p>

  <p>When it ended, dusk had just fallen. It was not going to be very dark, at
  least early in the evening, for a half-moon soared out from under the white
  fleecy clouds.</p>

  <p>Rock sat on the edge of the porch, attended again by the children. The
  older sons stalked away while the younger lingered, evidently accepting the
  newcomer. The womenfolk, except Thiry, who had gone into the other cabin with
  her father, were in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you tell Tom from Harry?&rdquo; Burr asked, mischievously, of
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Can you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure can,&rdquo; he replied, then whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
  you how if you get stuck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently the rancher came out alone. There was a lighted lamp inside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, hyar&rsquo;s some work fer you to break Rock in on
  tomorrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Grease the wheels of the green wagon. Then
  hitch up an&rsquo; go down to the slaughter-house. Fold tight an&rsquo; pack
  all the hides thet are dry. Haul them up to the barn. An&rsquo; Tom, next
  mornin&rsquo; soon as it&rsquo;s light you hitch up again an&rsquo; drive
  down an&rsquo; meet us at the Flats. Then you come back home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walk, I reckon?&rdquo; asked Tom, laconically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you can run if you like. An&rsquo; thet day an&rsquo; till I
  come back you-all work on the new pasture fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Pa,&rdquo; drawled Tom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, thet doesn&rsquo;t sound much like work to you. But your job
  is to keep these three harum scarums from ridin&rsquo; off into the woods.
  You&rsquo;ll have your hands full, fer they&rsquo;re shore
  Indians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, if I can&rsquo;t hold them in I&rsquo;ll do the work
  myself,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>Before the hour passed, Mrs. Preston and Alice came out, and Thiry, too,
  and they all sat around on the porch and grass enjoying the cool breeze
  coming up the Pass. The moon shone brighter as the clouds grew more open.
  There were moments of pale gloom, then a long interval of silver light. The
  shadow of the pines on the white grass fascinated Rock. And presently he
  found that being there, except for the silent Thiry so disturbing to him, was
  no different from being in the company of most any hospitable Western family.
  The discordant note&mdash;Ash Preston&mdash;was absent. Rock made himself as
  agreeable as he knew how, to the youngsters especially, and then to the
  mother, who responded readily. She was of pioneer extraction, simple, virile,
  and sincere. She had a hearty laugh; she liked news of the outside world.</p>

  <p>Preston retired within his cabin, and soon after the boys slouched away,
  their spurs jingling, their dark lank forms silhouetted against the
  moon-blanched grass.</p>

  <p>Trueman rose to say good night.</p>

  <p>Thiry had been standing some moments, in the shadow of the cabin,
  apparently listening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, would you like to walk with me to my cabin?&rdquo; she
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;pleased, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Rock, haltingly,
  scarce able to conceal his amaze and joy. What old-fashioned courtesy! Good
  nights were exchanged, and Rock found himself walking away under the great
  dark pines, in the shadowed moonlight, with Thiry beside him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">THIRY walked beside him, slender, light-stepping, with her
  profile showing clear-cut and cold in the moonlight. As she did not speak,
  Trueman dismissed the idea that her invitation was simply an old-fashioned
  courtesy. Therefore he made no attempt at conversation. When they had covered
  most of the distance to her cabin, without exchanging a single word, he felt
  anew and provokingly the growing excitement of this situation.</p>

  <p>At last she slowed her step, hesitated, and halted under the magnificent
  pine tree that made dark shade around her cabin. Outside the circle there
  were spaces of silver moonlight, and then streaks and bars of black shadow
  across the light. The night wind breathed in the huge spreading mass of
  foliage overhead. How supernaturally beautiful the place and moment!</p>

  <p>The girl confronted Trueman, and her face had the sheen of the moonlight,
  her eyes the darkness and mystery of the shade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, I want to talk to you,&rdquo; she said, very quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; rejoined Trueman, encouragingly, but he was not in the
  least encouraged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you been&mdash;wholly honest in coming out here to Sunset
  Pass?&rdquo; she asked, gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honest!&mdash;What do you mean?&rdquo; flashed Rock, his pride cut
  and his blissful anticipations fading.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you tell father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I asked for a job,&rdquo; returned Rock, curtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you let him believe the job was your sole reason for
  coming?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He said I hadn&rsquo;t been long in trailin&rsquo; you up. He
  was good-natured and nice. So I didn&rsquo;t deny it. I laughed and agreed
  with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;you did!&rdquo; she exclaimed, somehow shaken out of her
  reserve. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. I apologize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Preston, you don&rsquo;t owe me any apology,&rdquo; rejoined
  Rock, stiffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I thought you&rsquo;d deceived Dad&mdash;the same as so
  many riders have done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock had averted his face. He was astounded and hurt, suddenly, coldly
  checked in his romantic imaginings. What manner of girl was this Thiry
  Preston? It might be that she was a worthy sister to unsociable Ash Preston.
  But that resentful thought could not abide with his loyalty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, do you remember the last moment, when you were with me at
  the corral in Wagontongue?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to forget it,&rdquo; he returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You looked something at me. You didn&rsquo;t say so, but you meant
  you&rsquo;d see me again. Now didn&rsquo;t you? Honest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Preston, I&mdash;I certainly did,&rdquo; answered Rock,
  hastily. &ldquo;But, indeed, I didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude or&mdash;or
  bold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you were either,&rdquo; she said, earnestly.
  &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;But wait a moment. My sister is coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock glanced up to see the slim figure of Alice pass by toward the
  cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good night, Mr. Cowboy,&rdquo; she said, naïvely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good night, Miss Preston,&rdquo; replied Rock, trying to be
  gay.</p>

  <p>She went into the cabin and closed the door. Soon a light gleamed pale
  through a curtained window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We might sit down,&rdquo; suggested Thiry, indicating a rustic
  bench under the pine. &ldquo;I am tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bench appeared to catch a gleam of shadowed moonlight. Thiry could
  here be seen more clearly than while she stood in the shade. Rock preferred
  to stand, and he wished he could not see her so well.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand,&rdquo; she began,
  looking up. &ldquo;I was far from being insulted or even offended that day in
  the store and at the corral.... At the last, there, you meant you&rsquo;d see
  me again. And you&rsquo;ve done it. Now we&rsquo;re concerned with
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I might have waited a decent little while,&rdquo; responded
  Rock, as she paused. &ldquo;But I never met a girl like you. I wanted to see
  you again&mdash;soon. Where&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed there isn&rsquo;t any harm <i>in</i> it, Mr. Rock, but harm
  can come <i>from</i> it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Through my brother Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not hard to believe,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, with
  sharpness. &ldquo;The other day he was a drunken, vulgar lout. He ought to
  have been kicked out of that corral, and I&rsquo;d have done it but for you.
  Today, when he was sober, he was a different proposition to meet. He was
  cold, mean, vicious. He had no hospitality of the West&mdash;no idea what was
  due a tired and hungry stranger. But at that I&rsquo;d prefer him drunk. In
  my day on the range I&rsquo;ve met some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman bit his tongue. The girl had suddenly covered her face with her
  hands. He could see her strain and almost writhe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Miss Preston, forgive me,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t mean to distress you. I just spoke out quick, without
  thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She drew her hands away and lifted her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite
  right&mdash;Mr. Rock,&rdquo; she said, unsteadily. &ldquo;Ash is&mdash;all
  that you say. To my shame I confess it. All my life I&rsquo;ve made excuses
  for him. It&rsquo;s no use. I&mdash;I cannot do it&mdash;any more.... But
  that&rsquo;s not the point.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock sat down beside her, his anger flown, but there was another kind of
  heat running along his veins. How this girl must love her brother!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. The point was the harm that might come through Ash. Please
  be frank with me. If I&rsquo;ve brought this distress upon you, I&rsquo;m
  entitled to know why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been very&mdash;very fond of Ash,&rdquo; she
  said, tremulously, struggling for a composure that would not return.
  &ldquo;Partly because he was always so bad&mdash;and I seemed the only one
  who could influence him for good. Ash cares for nothing but me. Not for
  father, mother, brothers, or his other sisters. He hates men&mdash;he hates
  horses&mdash;he hates cattle.... And through these things I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
  stuck to him until now I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Rock, I can&rsquo;t tell
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spare yourself, Miss Preston,&rdquo; returned Rock, impulsively.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful&mdash;beautiful of you. I admire and respect you
  for it. But I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one can,&rdquo; she said, sadly. &ldquo;Alice thinks I&rsquo;m
  mad.... Oh, how I dread this! But it has to be done&mdash;more with you than
  with any other who ever tried to be friends with me. I&rsquo;ve known lots of
  boys, and liked them, too. But not lately. As I grow older Ash grows more
  jealous. He fears I might like some cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see! Is such a remarkable thing possible?&rdquo; returned
  Rock, unable to resist a slight sarcasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; she retorted. Her eyes flashed at him.
  &ldquo;What do you think I am, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Under the present circumstances I reckon I dare not tell
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, you are going to disappoint me, presently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens! What do you think I am, anyway?&rdquo; retorted Rock,
  in turn, growing almost desperate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I make a good deal of what Mother and Alice and Dad think,&rdquo;
  she said, gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he queried, suddenly mollified. She
  could do anything with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would dare tell you, but it would only make this unfortunate
  situation worse. I only hint of it&mdash;because it&rsquo;s not fair to let
  you think we&mdash;or I&mdash;dislike you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&mdash;I think I really like you, though it&rsquo;s such short
  notice for me.... And, Mr. Rock, if I had my way, I&rsquo;d like to be
  friends with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Thiry,&rdquo; he returned, gratefully, swayed by
  her unexpected avowal. &ldquo;Honest, I didn&rsquo;t hope for so much. All I
  wanted was a <i>chance</i> to prove I could deserve you&mdash;your
  friendship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I dare say you could,&rdquo; she returned, looking away.
  &ldquo;Mr. Winter used to tell me about you. How fond you were of
  Nick&mdash;how you saved his life once. Then Dad. He likes all cowboys, but I
  never saw him taken with anyone as he is with you.... But the thing is I
  <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be friends with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because of Ash?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s where the harm would come in. He will not let any
  boy or man be friends with me&mdash;at least out here at Sunset.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. I give up my job and go ride for some other
  outfit&mdash;<i>if</i> you will be my friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine and square of you, Mr. Rock, and I might promise
  so much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much? That isn&rsquo;t much. I mean only friendship. Do you think
  I&rsquo;m the kind of a man who&rsquo;d want a girl to give more than
  friendship until he&rsquo;d earned it? Well, I&rsquo;m not. And I
  wouldn&rsquo;t ask anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, you&rsquo;re making this harder for me,&rdquo; she said,
  with pathos.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. But go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboys have called on me here and many have come to ride for Dad.
  Just the regular run of cowboys. Ash soon got rid of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder how he did all that. I know cowboys well, where a pretty
  girl is concerned. And I&rsquo;m just curious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. Ash has chased them away in every conceivable
  manner. He&rsquo;s lied, as he lied to you about my not seeing riders who
  came to Sunset. He&rsquo;d coolly invite them to leave. He&rsquo;d bluff.
  He&rsquo;d threaten. He&rsquo;d cripple and shoot their horses. Oh, that was
  the vilest thing! He&rsquo;d get them drunk while on guard&mdash;which Dad
  couldn&rsquo;t forgive. He&rsquo;d ridicule any sensitive cowboy before the
  outfit&mdash;so terribly that the poor fellow would leave. He&rsquo;d concoct
  devilish schemes to make a cowboy seem negligent or crooked. And as a last
  resource he&rsquo;d pick fights. Oh, he has beaten several cowboys brutally.
  Then worst of all&mdash;he has thrown his gun on more than one. Archie Black
  will be a cripple for life. And Jack Worthington nearly died of a
  gun-shot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very interestin&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, and for the life
  of him he could not keep his voice normal. &ldquo;And has nothin&rsquo; ever
  happened to this bully?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Ash didn&rsquo;t always come out scot-free. But nothing to
  bother him. I don&rsquo;t believe Ash has nerves or heart or
  feeling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet you love him!&rdquo; ejaculated Rock, bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;more because I seem the only one. But it&rsquo;s not so
  much that. I&rsquo;ve kept him from going to the bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could he be any worse?&rdquo; asked Trueman, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he could be. You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
  understand. But I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Thiry, have you been so vastly concerned for the good health
  of all these poor lovesick cowboys as you seem about mine?&rdquo; asked
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are sarcastic again. Oh, you&rsquo;re not&mdash;so nice as I
  thought you&rsquo;d be.... Yes, I was concerned&mdash;worried about these
  boys. But I&rsquo;ve never been so&mdash;so scared as I am over your
  coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scared!&mdash;For me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, for you&mdash;a little. Oh, I can&rsquo;t lie to you.
  I&rsquo;m scared because of the&mdash;the harm that may come&mdash;if you
  stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little! Flow nice of you! All you think of is poor dear Brother.
  For my face to be beat to a jelly or my leg shot off or worse&mdash;that
  causes you only a little concern. Thanks, Miss Preston. I&rsquo;m
  beginnin&rsquo; to believe I idealized you rather high.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly horrid!&rdquo; she cried, passionately.
  &ldquo;Yes, indeed, you must have idealized me beyond my merits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock leaned closer to study the lovely face, the deep eyes that flamed at
  him yet tried to hide true feelings. He could speak bitter words, but was
  instantly full of remorse. Yet how sweet to hurt her!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look me straight in the eyes,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;You
  can&rsquo;t&mdash;you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;you&mdash;certainly I can,&rdquo; she returned, startled.
  And she did, gravely, tragically. What a marvelous abyss Trueman Rock gazed
  into! He lost himself there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said you couldn&rsquo;t lie?&rdquo; queried Rock, cruelly,
  overcome by his own catastrophe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never told&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;black lie in my life,&rdquo; she
  faltered, with her head lifting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;are <i>you</i> honest with me? What is the reason you
  want me to run off like a coward?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you,&rdquo; she replied, hastily
  ignoring his first query, which he saw had made her start. &ldquo;But I
  don&rsquo;t want you to be a coward. I&rsquo;d think it brave, generous, to
  help me. I told you and I tell you again harm, terrible harm, might come of
  this, if you stay. Ash will not try any of his tricks on you. For you are
  different. Why, my dad said to me, not an hour ago, &lsquo;There, lass, is a
  cowboy whose face Ash won&rsquo;t rub in the dirt. An&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t
  be throwin&rsquo; guns around so careless. For, Thiry, this fellow, True
  Rock, is a different kind of a hombre from all those Ash has stacked up
  against....&rsquo; Those were Dad&rsquo;s very words. I was thunderstruck. It
  seemed almost as if Dad was <i>glad</i>. I never saw him speak like that. And
  lightning flashed from his eyes.... Oh, this spurred me to speak with you.
  Can&rsquo;t you see? You are different. You&rsquo;re a man&mdash;and one with
  a&mdash;a&mdash;please forgive&mdash;a bloody record. I don&rsquo;t despise
  you because of that. Mr. Winter told me of your meeting with that vile
  Pickins. That same Pickins was once an enemy of father&rsquo;s. Since
  I&rsquo;ve lived West I&rsquo;ve learned there are bad gunmen and good
  gunmen. My brother Ash is one kind&mdash;you are the other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry Preston, first you are cruel, then you are kind,&rdquo;
  replied Rock, hoarsely, as she paused to catch her breath, with a hand
  pressed upon her heart. &ldquo;If you want to drive me away I advise you to
  keep on bein&rsquo; cruel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was in the grip of strong emotion now, beautiful and soul-moving to
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t stay here&mdash;with us&mdash;and&mdash;and
  leave me alone?&rdquo; she asked, with a simplicity wholly free of
  vanity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I might&mdash;if you cut me cold or slammed the door in my
  face,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I couldn&rsquo;t do. If you stay on, living here and eating at
  our table, I could not help but talk to you, be with you some. I think it
  would be nice&mdash;if Ash wasn&rsquo;t around to make me so sick.
  I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I might like you. There isn&rsquo;t any reason why I
  shouldn&rsquo;t.... Now, if you
  stayed&mdash;you&rsquo;d&mdash;you&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She broke off as if unable to find adequate expression. But her voice, her
  look, were more than sufficient to make Rock fight temptation. How easy to
  lie to this innocent girl! He could do that and stay on here, and deceive Ash
  Preston, too.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Thiry, I would,&rdquo; he returned, swiftly, to get by
  the danger. &ldquo;I would be a very great deal worse than any cowboy you
  ever knew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So&mdash;you see,&rdquo; she said, entreatingly. &ldquo;Then you
  and Ash would fight over me.... First with fists, probably, like a couple of
  beasts. Then with guns!... Oh, that&rsquo;s the horror of it.... There would
  be blood spilled. He might kill you, which would be terrible. But most likely
  you would kill <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose I did?&rdquo; flashed Rock, torn between pity and
  jealousy.</p>

  <p>She leaped up to stand rigid, with clenched hands and swelling bosom, with
  such blazing eyes of passion that he was stunned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it was not my death&mdash;I&rsquo;d kill you myself,&rdquo; she
  cried, intensely.</p>

  <p>How wonderful she was! Almost he forgot all in sheer ecstasy. Then remorse
  laid hold of him again. He was torturing her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Thiry, forgive me again,&rdquo; he pleaded.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said an awful thing. But I was to blame. Please sit down.
  ... That was only my temper. Listen. I hope I&rsquo;ll never get into
  <i>any</i> kind of a fight with Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what are good intentions to men&mdash;where a woman is
  concerned? You couldn&rsquo;t keep out of it. You have a fiery temper.... And
  Ash&mdash;that devil would make a saint fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just make up my mind I won&rsquo;t fight. I&rsquo;ll
  keep out of his way. I&rsquo;ll do anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except let me alone. Oh, I can&rsquo;t trust you, Mr. Rock. I
  daren&rsquo;t trust the situation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, girl, be reasonable. No one yet ever made me do what I
  didn&rsquo;t want to do. If I say I won&rsquo;t fight with words or fists or
  guns&mdash;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not if he insulted you vilely before my family&mdash;and others?
  Not if he slapped you, spat in your face, kicked you as if you were a
  dog?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Girl, in that case I couldn&rsquo;t be so sure of myself. But I
  might stand all that for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have you do it,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
  wouldn&rsquo;t let you be a coward&mdash;be despised by my people&mdash;all
  these range-riders, and your friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those who know me would understand. Reckon I wouldn&rsquo;t care
  about others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;d be dreadful to make such&mdash;a&mdash;a fool of
  yourself over me,&rdquo; she protested, hotly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
  wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You might not be able to help it. I&rsquo;d have to be a
  fool&mdash;or else True Rock&mdash;one or the other. And I&rsquo;d certainly
  rather be a fool than hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve only seen me once!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
  despairingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not committin&rsquo; myself yet, because I&rsquo;d hate
  to embarrass you more without bein&rsquo; sure. But I&rsquo;m afraid, if
  seein&rsquo; you the other day wasn&rsquo;t enough, this time
  <i>is</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, please go away tomorrow&mdash;before it&rsquo;s too
  late,&rdquo; she implored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want me to go as bad as that?&rdquo; asked Rock, weakening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg you to. I&rsquo;ve begun to be afraid of you, and I
  wasn&rsquo;t at first. You&rsquo;re so sharp&mdash;so keen.
  You&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly in her agitation, she jerked a hand to her lips, as if to silence
  them. Her eyes dilated. She stared up at Rock like a child who had almost
  betrayed herself. And Rock, if he did not read her mind, had intuition enough
  to grasp that part of Thiry&rsquo;s fear, perhaps the greater, was not due to
  the inevitable clash between him and Ash. She was afraid he would find out
  something. Rock hastened to thrust the insidious thought from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Afraid of me!&rdquo; he ejaculated, hurriedly. &ldquo;Why,
  Thiry&mdash;Miss Thiry, that&rsquo;s absurd! Right this minute I&rsquo;m the
  best friend you have in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then prove it,&rdquo; she said, bending closer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go away tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And never see you again?&rdquo; he queried, blankly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be best,&rdquo; she returned, and looked away. &ldquo;But
  I didn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;d never see me again. Perhaps I&mdash;we might
  meet in town. I&rsquo;m going in over the Fourth. Mrs. Dabb is to give a
  dance. I could see you there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that Rock laughed rather wildly. &ldquo;At Amy Wund&rsquo;s house? Not
  much....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then at the dance. It won&rsquo;t be at her house.
  I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go with you&mdash;if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bribe me to run off from Sunset Pass,&rdquo; he said,
  ponderingly. &ldquo;But thank you for sayin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d go with me.
  I&rsquo;d like to. But I&rsquo;m not invited and don&rsquo;t expect to
  be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you get an invitation, Mr. Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tempt me. I&rsquo;d almost give my head to take you to
  a dance. I&rsquo;d almost quit my job here and then come back to it
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that would be a lie,&rdquo; she returned, severely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I might lie, too. I don&rsquo;t mean <i>to</i> you, but
  <i>for</i> you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Rock, go away tomorrow before trouble comes. I&rsquo;ll
  never be able to thank you enough. It&rsquo;s the only chance you have to be
  my&mdash;my friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer, wonderful girl,&rdquo; he replied, puzzled
  and sad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will come to town oftener&mdash;then,&rdquo; she almost
  whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d meet me in town and hope to deceive Ash?&rdquo; queried
  Rock, bluntly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d find it out. You can&rsquo;t fool that hombre. Then
  he would have a real case against me. He&rsquo;d hunt me down, force me to
  meet him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I give in to you and leave Sunset Pass, I&rsquo;d never
  willingly see you again,&rdquo; he went on, with more bitterness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, that wouldn&rsquo;t be such a&mdash;a loss to you as you
  imagine now,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that I hate to refuse you
  anythin&rsquo;. Reckon I can&rsquo;t, if it&rsquo;s for your sake. But if I
  do it, I&rsquo;ll go plumb to hell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She questioned him with mute lips and beseeching glance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen. There&rsquo;s two sides to this deal, and here&rsquo;s
  mine,&rdquo; he began, leaning close so that he could see her better in the
  pale shadow. &ldquo;I want you to know about me. I was born in Illinois. My
  mother and father are livin&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re quite old now. I was home
  five years ago. I have a sister. She ought to be nineteen now&mdash;a fine,
  pretty girl. Well, I went to school till we moved out West. Then I went to
  ridin&rsquo;. My father lost out in the cattle business and took the family
  back home. I stayed. That was&mdash;fourteen&mdash;sixteen years ago.
  Durin&rsquo; these sixteen years I&rsquo;ve lived the life of a
  wanderin&rsquo;, ridin&rsquo;, drinkin&rsquo;, fightin&rsquo; cowboy. I stuck
  here on this range longest of all. I don&rsquo;t say I was bad, but I
  wasn&rsquo;t much good.... I was always gettin&rsquo; in trouble for other
  people.... That&rsquo;s how I came to shoot Pickins. It was a good riddance.
  But the sheriff then&mdash;Cass Seward&mdash;was a friend of Pickins&rsquo;s.
  I didn&rsquo;t want to kill Seward, so I left Wagontongue. I stayed away six
  years. Then had to come back. I got there the day I met you. Found out Seward
  was gone. Found out a lot of other things. I wanted to know about my old
  girls. I had always been crazy over pretty girls. Ran after anyone. Liked
  some&mdash;and, reckoned I loved&mdash;or imagined I loved others. Sol Winter
  told me a lot of bad news about the girls&mdash;and about his son Nick. So I
  lost my happy mood. I wanted to go out and get drunk. Sol asked me to keep
  store for him. And I sat there sinkin&rsquo; into one of the old black spells
  that had kept me from makin&rsquo; some one out of myself. Pretty soon I
  would go and get awful drunk. I had a hunch that it&rsquo;d be kind of a
  climax in my life. But I didn&rsquo;t care.... Then you, Thiry Preston,
  walked in that store. And I didn&rsquo;t want to go out and get drunk.
  Somethin&rsquo; happened. I don&rsquo;t know yet what it was. But it was
  wonderful. Sure you remember how funny I was&mdash;don&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought you funny then, but now I see you
  weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure not so funny now,&rdquo; he went on, with dark
  passion. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; happened to me. It&rsquo;s been such a
  tearin&rsquo;, changin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; that I don&rsquo;t know myself.
  I&rsquo;m findin&rsquo; out little by little. Seein&rsquo; you this second
  time has helped a lot. I&rsquo;ll make a clean breast of all&mdash;soon as I
  know. But right now I know&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t turn your back on
  me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never drink again. Or hunt for a fight! Or waste my time
  and money!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;Rock!&rdquo; she exclaimed, rising, low-voiced and
  trembling. &ldquo;Are you telling me you&mdash;you love me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not tellin&rsquo; you that,&rdquo; he returned,
  doggedly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure afraid somethin&rsquo;s terrible
  wrong....it&rsquo;s this here wrong, Miss Thiry&mdash;that if you <i>make</i>
  me, by your coldness to me and your pleadin&rsquo; for that no-good brother,
  leave Sunset Pass, I&rsquo;ll go plumb to hell. I know that. It&rsquo;d be
  too much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coldness?... I think I have been anything but cold,&rdquo; she
  murmured, sinking back on the bench.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve frozen me so I&rsquo;m stiff. I can&rsquo;t talk. But
  it&rsquo;ll be good for me. I&rsquo;ve been spoiled. I&rsquo;ve grown
  conceited. I need just this lesson you&rsquo;re teachin&rsquo; me.... But,
  Miss Thiry, please&mdash;please don&rsquo;t make me go away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could I make you do anything? How silly!&mdash;But if you&rsquo;re
  manly enough to save me misery, you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hittin&rsquo; hard,&rdquo; he returned, shrinking.
  Then he jerked up his drooping head. &ldquo;Suppose I get it into my mind
  that by <i>stayin&rsquo;</i> I can save you <i>more</i> misery?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock!&rdquo; she cried, shocked.</p>

  <p>His sudden query had been a random shot, but it struck home. Rock&rsquo;s
  heart leaped. He had to stifle a wild impulse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> I might,&rdquo; he returned, almost coldly.
  &ldquo;Give me a day to think over whether I&rsquo;ll go or stay. Reckon so
  far the fight&rsquo;s one-sided and in your favor.... I&rsquo;ll meet you
  tomorrow night and tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night.&mdash;Here at this hour?&rdquo; she returned,
  rising from the seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Good night, Miss Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very sorry&mdash;&mdash;You.... Good
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock gave her one long look as she stood now in the moonlight. He would
  carry that picture in his heart of hearts all his days. Then he strode away,
  and when he turned, at quite some distance, she was still standing like a
  white statue.</p>

  <p>He made his bed on the porch, so that he could lie there and watch the
  moon, and think over this maddening situation.</p>

  <p>For hours it seemed he never got anywhere, so far as decision was
  concerned. His mind was chaotic. The moon soared white and grand above the
  pines and the night wind roared. Coyotes mourned eerily. A deep-voiced hound
  bayed them in answer. A low soft murmur of running water came to him in the
  lulls of the wind.</p>

  <p>At last he admitted that he loved Thiry Preston. Time was nothing. He had
  always known her, and though the hours were but few since their actual
  meeting, he was now measuring their incomprehensible length and fullness. But
  he hated the idea that he only loved her. That was putting her with the
  others. His love for Amy, Polly, and Kit had merely been growing pangs toward
  this real and beautiful thing.</p>

  <p>It was great and would suffice Rock for all time. Not one second longer
  did he hesitate about sacrificing himself for her happiness. He could glory
  in that and still keep from going to hell, as he had childishly
  threatened.</p>

  <p>This resolve cleared his mind of vacillation and bewilderment and
  conflicting tides of emotion. The rest was easy and required only
  intelligence. If he could best serve Thiry Preston by passing out of her life
  as quickly as he had come into it he would do so. But he had a strange
  persistent recurrence of a doubt. He recalled her words, her looks, her
  actions, and relentlessly analyzed them. His love, once acknowledged, incited
  and stimulated his mind.</p>

  <p>Before the moon tipped the pines above the rim of the Pass, which was late
  in the early morning hours, Rock had solved at least the second of his three
  problems.</p>

  <p>Thiry Preston was honestly afraid her brother Ash would kill him or that
  he would kill Ash. So she wanted to send Rock away. But only so far was she
  wholly honest.</p>

  <p>She feared Rock would discover something wrong there at Sunset Pass. Ash
  Preston was crooked. No doubt of this! Perhaps the father was, too, and some
  of the brothers. But Mrs. Preston was ignorant of it; so were Alice, and the
  younger brothers. Thiry bore this burden alone. That was the secret of her
  sad eyes and lips. That was the power Ash Preston had over her&mdash;love for
  him and fear. It did no longer seem unnatural. That was why no cowboys ever
  got a fair chance to win Thiry Preston&rsquo;s friendship.</p>

  <p>What a terrible situation for Rock to fall upon! It was at once the most
  maddening and thrilling and irresistible thing that had ever happened to him.
  It was the big event of his life. It called to all the heights of emotion of
  which he was capable.</p>

  <p>To go or stay&mdash;that was the question! If he left her, she might love
  him, surely would always remember him regretfully, tenderly. If he stayed she
  would hate him. But then he might save her.</p>

  <p>Rock knew the West. He had become a part of it. The Prestons were new,
  comparatively, to this wild range. He knew Western men, their slow evolution,
  their uncanny power to suspect and search out and find among them the
  cattleman who transgressed the unwritten laws. All cattle-raisers stole from
  one another. But there was a distinction with a difference.</p>

  <p>Gage Preston was getting rich&mdash;a little bit swiftly for a rancher on
  an ordinary scale. How? Rock answered the query in many ways, but only one
  way seemed tenable. Preston sold cattle on the hoof, the same as other
  ranchers. None but rustlers ever sold cattle that did not belong to them. And
  certainly Preston could not be a rustler. It was inconceivable that Ash
  Preston could be a rustler, either, at least without his father knowing. But
  Rock scouted the rustler idea.</p>

  <p>The Prestons had become butchers of cattle on a considerable scale. Did
  anyone, outside themselves, know just how many steers they butchered? What a
  pertinent question here! Rock was certain that he would find out that no
  outsiders knew how many head of stock they killed. And here was the gist of
  the matter.</p>

  <p>Some of the Prestons, with Ash at the head, and the father either in with
  them or unable to prevent it, were killing cattle not their own, burning or
  hiding the skins, and selling the beef at near and distant points.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; muttered Rock, under his breath.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hit it plumb center.&mdash;The damn fools, thinkin&rsquo;
  they can hide that long!... Gage Preston ought to have more sense. He struck
  me queer, though. But it&rsquo;s that rattlesnake son who&rsquo;s got this
  outfit buffaloed. No wonder poor Thiry has sad eyes.... Well, by Heaven,
  I&rsquo;ll stay at Sunset Pass!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">A BELL awakened Rock from late slumbers. The sun was up, and
  as he peeped out over his blanket covering he saw the grass shine gold under
  the cedars. He had overslept, which was not a remarkable fact, considering
  how long it had taken him to get to sleep. As he had neglected to undress,
  except to remove his boots, it did not take him long to get ready for the
  day.</p>

  <p>While performing his ablutions his thoughts whirled, and then steadied to
  the stern consideration of the task before him. In the sober light of day it
  seemed tremendous. He had to prove his suspicions, which had lost no strength
  during sleep, and if they were well founded, then he must somehow stop the
  illicit proceedings before the Prestons were overwhelmed by catastrophe.</p>

  <p>No new thing for Rock was it to appear a light-hearted, careless cowboy
  when underneath this guise he was hard and cautious, keen as a blade. The
  Prestons, excepting possibly Ash, would be easy to deceive.</p>

  <p>Briskly he strode toward the double cabin, conscious of heart-beating
  anticipation, and when he thumped upon the porch Alice Preston came out of
  the kitchen, carrying plates and cup, which she set upon the table. She
  smiled at him. How pretty she was!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed, Miss Alice,&rdquo; he said as he stepped over
  the bench. &ldquo;Think of a cowboy late on his first mornin&rsquo; of a new
  job!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It took three rings this morning to fetch you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did it? I must have been dead to the world. Who rung
  them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good to persevere. But I promise it&rsquo;ll not
  happen again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Preston looked out of the kitchen and greeted Rock with pleasant
  smile and words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are the boys up, too?&rdquo; he asked as he fell upon the ham and
  eggs and hot biscuits.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Land&rsquo;s sake! they&rsquo;re up an&rsquo; gone long ago,&rdquo;
  she replied. &ldquo;They were sure funny. Tom said; &lsquo;Let him sleep, Ma.
  The longer the better.&rsquo;... An&rsquo; Al said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wake
  the new boss, Ma. He won&rsquo;t never get no sleep when Ash is here, so let
  him get some now.&rsquo;... An&rsquo; Harry said: &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t Thiry up
  yet, either? Reckon settin&rsquo; up in the moonlight is bad for some
  folks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sure is, Mrs. Preston,&rdquo; laughed Rock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  sorry, though, if I&rsquo;m to blame.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Thiry was up hours ago,&rdquo; Alice informed them. &ldquo;Saw
  Pa and the boys ride away. I know she had a run-in with Ash, because she had
  been cryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Rock, bending over his plate and
  eating fast. He had seen the mother&rsquo;s face change very slightly, almost
  imperceptibly. Ash Preston was a thorn in the flesh of this wholesome
  family.</p>

  <p>Rock made short work of his breakfast, and glad somehow that he had not
  encountered Thiry, he hurried away down toward the corrals. Pre-occupied as
  he was, he yet saw and felt and smelled afresh the incomparable beauty and
  spirit and fragrance of this Sunset Pass. Already the wind had begun its roar
  in the pines.</p>

  <p>At the barnyard Rock found Al Preston leading in some horses; and one of
  his brothers was jacking up a hind wheel of the green wagon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, boss. Hope you&rsquo;re not sick,&rdquo; drawled
  Al.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, I was plumb dead. I&rsquo;ll sure let you punish me for
  bein&rsquo; lazy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other boy nodded at Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you Tom or Harry?&rdquo; asked Rock, suddenly reminded of the
  twins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wanta bet on it?&rdquo; queried the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be darned if I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Harry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Harry, I&rsquo;ll know you tomorrow or bust.
  Where&rsquo;s Tom?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He left us to grease the wagon and went off after a horse for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For my white horse, Egypt?&rdquo; asked Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;sorry to say,&rdquo; returned Harry,
  haltingly, as if he had bad news.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did Egypt jump the pasture fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Ash saddled him and rode off on him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock sat down suddenly, stifling the yell that leaped to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was just daylight when I got down here,&rdquo; went on Harry.
  &ldquo;Range and Scoot were just ridin&rsquo; off. Ash had your horse and
  saddle. Pa was cussin&rsquo; Ash awful. Reckon they&rsquo;d been
  arguin&rsquo;, &rsquo;cause Pa never cusses till he&rsquo;s wore out. Well,
  when he got done Ash says, &lsquo;Pa, how&rsquo;d you like to go to
  hell?&rsquo; Then he forks your horse and rides after the boys. Pa
  &rsquo;peared to be chokin&rsquo; mad. All of a sudden he busted out
  laughin&rsquo;. He climbed up on the wagon with Boots, and they
  left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock for the moment succumbed to a silent fury. But seeing the gray-eyed
  brothers watching him curiously, keen to catch how he would take this first
  move of Ash&rsquo;s, he thought he had better explode naturally and
  wholesomely, as might any cowboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; he yelled, lustily. &ldquo;He took my new white horse!
  And my saddle that I wouldn&rsquo;t lend to the King of England!... Never had
  that happen to me. Doggone!&mdash;Boys, was it supposed to be a
  joke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Joke nothin&rsquo;. Ash was just mean, like he always is when we
  get a new rider. But reckon you&rsquo;ll have to take it as a
  joke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh! I will&mdash;like the old lady who keeps tavern out
  West!&rdquo; replied Rock, with a short laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, boss?&rdquo; inquired Al, hugely delighted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like h&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; answered Rock. &ldquo;Boys, I reckon
  I&rsquo;m the maddest cowpuncher that ever was. I think I&rsquo;ll get a
  horse and saddle from you, and go after my own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you take my advice you&rsquo;ll swallow it&mdash;leastways till
  Ash comes back. Chances are he won&rsquo;t do Egypt no harm. If you follow
  Ash now, mad as you are, there&rsquo;ll only be another fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take it as a joke. Or better be nice about it,&rdquo; added Harry.
  &ldquo;That always stumps Ash. If he can&rsquo;t make you mad he lets
  up&mdash;for a while, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, boys. I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; rejoined Rock,
  grateful for their solicitude. &ldquo;But I reckon the good Lord himself
  couldn&rsquo;t keep my mouth shut&mdash;after that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to work,&rdquo; suggested Harry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
  late. And Ash ain&rsquo;t the only one Pa can cuss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While Rock and Al greased the wagon wheels, Harry hitched up, and by the
  time this task was done Tom rode in, leading a horse. It was a bay that
  instantly took Rock&rsquo;s eye, and which would have made up for the loss of
  &rsquo;most any horse, except one like Egypt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ash&rsquo;s saddle?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo; there,&rdquo; replied Al. &ldquo;But, gee!
  you won&rsquo;t ride his, will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be darned if I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Rock, with
  grim humor. &ldquo;You boys rustle along. I&rsquo;ll catch up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come down the road by the pasture, boss,&rdquo; said Al.
  &ldquo;Then take the right-hand road. You can&rsquo;t miss the
  slaughter-house, for the stink will knock you down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After the boys left, Rock proceeded to put Ash&rsquo;s saddle and bridle
  on the bay horse, but he was not in any hurry. This first trick of Ash
  Preston&rsquo;s rankled in Rock. &ldquo;Wonder what Thiry will say,&rdquo; he
  soliloquized. &ldquo;She must have seen Ash on my horse. That&rsquo;s what
  upset her.... Damn him!&mdash;He must be one of those people who make the
  angels weep. And here I am with my hands tied!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Rock rode around the barn he espied the wagon far ahead down the
  gentle slope. He moved on at a trot, his mind busy, his active eye on the
  gardens and fields where he saw Mexicans at work. He came to the forks of the
  road, and taking the left one he entered the cedars, climbed the ridge, and
  descended to a grassy open meadow, only to mount another cedared ridge. He
  remembered this part of the Pass, though not so well as the general view of
  it from the divide. Willows and cottonwoods lined the brown brook,
  jack-rabbits were numerous; hawks sailed over the open country and blue jays
  screeched from the slope. It was not long until the sweet sage-wind suffered
  a change and became tainted. Rock rode up a sparsely cedared slope to a level
  bench, and soon came upon the site that had once been Slagle&rsquo;s ranch.
  The boys were halting before the several cabins. As Rock rode up, the stench
  unmistakably heralded a slaughter-house. Cabins, corral fences, barns and
  sheds, and even the trees bore ghastly evidence of the nature of what this
  old Slagle ranch had sunk to. Skins of cattle hung everywhere.</p>

  <p>The horses were turned loose to graze, and Rock, with the three boys, set
  to work. It was no easy task for one man, or even two men, to fold a stiff
  hide and compress it into small space. But that was what they had to do. The
  Preston boys might have been skillful and diligent at other kinds of ranch
  work, but at this particular job they were lazy. They made no bones of saying
  they hated it and particularly the inescapable smell. As the day grew warmer
  the odor increased. Rock did not drive the boys, but he drove himself. He
  heard Al say to his brothers in an aside, &ldquo;Sure he&rsquo;s a hawg for
  work.&rdquo; Rock felt it good to sweat and toil again, despite the
  unpleasantness of the task.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, during this labor, and while joking with the brothers,
  without any ostensible interest in the place or the hides, Rock was bending
  all his keen faculties toward the end that he had determined upon. Nothing
  escaped his sharp eye, yet during the half day that it took to complete this
  job he did not observe anything that struck him significantly. Toward late
  afternoon, however, he happened to kick a piece of white substance, not
  stone, and of a color markedly contrasting with the red earth. When he picked
  it up he thought it was clay. He smelled it&mdash;tasted it. Quicklime! Rock
  put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>In due time Tom mounted the loaded wagon to drive home, while the other
  brothers rode off toward the woods, each now with a rifle over his
  pommel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll poke along, Tom,&rdquo; said Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You been callin&rsquo; me Tom all day an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  Harry,&rdquo; retorted the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be darned if I believe you,&rdquo; replied Rock.
  &ldquo;You fellows are havin&rsquo; fun with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently Rock was left alone. He was satisfied that he had gotten along
  well with the boys and that they liked him. They were so guileless that he
  knew he could pursue his suspicions almost before their backs were turned.
  They surely were as honest boys as any one could find.</p>

  <p>He took out the piece of quicklime. It did not appear to be very old. He
  looked around where he had found it to see if there was more. After diligent
  search he found a smaller piece. Quicklime in any quantity there, might be
  used to deaden the stench of decaying offal, blood, and bones. Rock searched
  all the cabins, sheds, bins, without finding any more. None had ever been
  used upon the horrible pile that had accumulated in the hollow below the
  slaughter-house. This heap had been left to the hogs, the coyotes and the
  weathering process of nature.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon no little piece of quicklime could get down here of its own
  accord,&rdquo; muttered Rock, deliberating. &ldquo;It sure never flew. It
  must have been fetched here with more of the same. What for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had no other answer than the first he had conjectured. Manifestly the
  Prestons left the entrails and skeletons of their cattle there on the ground
  to rot. No need to waste valuable time destroying what the elements, the
  dogs, coyotes, and hogs would soon do away with. But they might have left
  something here that they wanted to destroy quickly. Hides! Cow hides they
  could not sell because these did not bear their brands!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, into Rock&rsquo;s searching mind there flashed memory of
  a deep well he had once helped to dig on these premises. It had been a job,
  he recalled, that every one of the half dozen cowboys had rebelled at, and
  had scornfully told Slagle was labor wasted. The digging had not been without
  considerable hazard. They had to go so deep that it was necessary to enlarge
  the hole. Slagle wanted to get water close at hand, to obviate the necessity
  of packing it uphill from the brook. But they never struck water, and at
  eighty feet abandoned the effort.</p>

  <p>Since that time brush had grown heavily all around the ranch houses, but
  after some search Rock located the well. The edges had weathered, widening
  the mouth. He could not get right to the brink at this point. On the opposite
  side, however, opened a break in the brush. He was about to crash his way
  through the bushes, around to this opening, when his caution urged him not to
  leave a trail. Carefully he retraced his steps, worked around into a narrow
  path, in which he saw boot tracks.</p>

  <p>Reaching the well, Rock peered down. He saw only the gravel sides and the
  black hole. He dropped a stone into it. No sound! He thought that strange.
  Selecting a larger one he leaned over and let it fall. The hole certainly was
  deep. A low soft thud, barely distinguishable, came to his taut ears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;That well had a rock
  bottom....We had to quit diggin&rsquo; because of rock. Son-of-a-gun if this
  isn&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; hot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock cautiously stretched himself on the ground, and putting his head over
  the brink of the well he sniffed like a tracking hound. He caught a faint
  scent of something that was not earth or brush and certainly not rotting
  hides. And it was rotting cattle hides which he expected to smell.</p>

  <p>Resting a moment, he tried again. This time he caught the scent strongly
  enough to recognize it. Quicklime!</p>

  <p>Rock sat up, suddenly sweating, though he felt a cold chill. He felt no
  doubt that down this well, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cattle hides had
  been dropped&mdash;not one of which bore the Preston brand.</p>

  <p>The knowledge staggered him. Suspicion, after all, was not fact. And logic
  told him that until he had actually seen hidden hides, with other brands than
  Preston&rsquo;s, he had no actual proof. Yet he would have staked his life
  that his suspicions were correct. He would bide his time, and at favorable
  opportunity he would come down here with a hook of some kind, and plenty of
  rope, and he would fish one of those hides up out of the well.</p>

  <p>Rock crawled on hand and knees back along the edge of the path, making
  certain not to leave the slightest mark. He found another piece of quicklime,
  and several smaller pieces. No doubt they had spilled out of a sack. When he
  got to the boot tracks he scrutinized them with the photographing eyes of a
  trailer of long experience. He cut twigs from the under side of a bush, and
  with minute care measured the length and breadth of the most clearly defined
  print. These twigs he stored in his pocket.</p>

  <p>He retraced his steps back to the open, and saddling the horse the boys
  had brought up before they left, he mounted, and rode quickly away to get out
  of the stench.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More than one kind of a stink there, I reckon,&rdquo; he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>The daily phenomenon that gave this Pass its name was in full and glorious
  sweep when Rock reached his cabin. Weary and worried as he was, he had to sit
  down and watch the beautiful end of day.</p>

  <p>There were fewer clouds and these hung round the distant peaks, as if
  anchored to the steep higher slopes. Strange to see no gold in this sunset!
  But pearl gray and silver sheen and shell pink filled the great gap of sky.
  The curtains and shafts of colored light were wanting, too. Yet withal there
  was exquisite beauty, rarer, more delicate, quickly evanescent and soon
  gone.</p>

  <p>Rock shaved and changed his clothes, thinking of everything he could to
  keep away the tantalizing and heart-depressing thought of the interview with
  Thiry so soon to come. Yet behind every vague and swift idea that he called
  up hovered the shadow of this girl and the unfortunate circumstances in which
  she must be involved, and the fate that had lured him into her life.</p>

  <p>He made sure, this evening, to be on hand before the first supper bell
  rang. All the younger members of the family, except Thiry, came at the call.
  The children romped from one side and the boys raced from the other. Alice,
  who had rung the bell and called, gayly, &ldquo;Come and get it,&rdquo; took
  her seat beside Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re livelier when Ash and Pa are away,&rdquo; she said,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I notice. Sure hope they stay away long,&rdquo; he replied,
  remarking how singularly she spoke of Ash before her father. Rock kept roving
  eyes on the quest for Thiry. But he was looking the wrong way when her voice,
  almost at his elbow, gave him a pang that was both pain and joy in one. She
  and Mrs. Preston were bringing in the supper. The children were noisily
  merry; and the boys cracked jokes, some of which, vague riddles, Rock guessed
  might have reference to him. Mrs. Preston was the last to take a seat at the
  table, and she occupied her husband&rsquo;s place. Thiry, as before, sat
  opposite Rock, and when he could summon courage to look straight at her he
  suffered another twinge at the enhanced sadness of her face.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Rock had such hold on himself that he amused and interested
  Mrs. Preston, brought smiles to Alice&rsquo;s face and shouts of glee from
  the children. But as soon as he had finished supper he excused himself and
  seeking the gloom of the pines, he gave himself up to turbulent
  anticipations.</p>

  <p>The moon appeared long in rising, and Rock, patrolling a beat under the
  trees, both longingly and fearfully watched for the silver radiance over the
  rim. It came at last and found him unprepared. How could he bear to terrorize
  Thiry Preston by confessing his determination to stay?</p>

  <p>At length he could not longer procrastinate. Skirting the edge of the
  pines, he circled the slope, and coming to the stream he followed that up to
  a level, and soon found the great pine under which he had talked with Thiry
  the night before. The far side of the Pass was blanched in moonlight; this
  side was dark in shadow. Rock was unable to see the rustic seat until he
  could almost touch the tree.</p>

  <p>To his mingled relief and disappointment Thiry was not there. He sat down
  to watch and think. A light shone through the curtained window of her
  cabin.</p>

  <p>Trueman could not rally any connected thoughts. He must wait until she
  came&mdash;until he could see and hear her. That moment would liberate him.
  He had waited at a rendezvous for many a girl&mdash;a situation always
  attended with pleasurable and sometimes perplexing sensations&mdash;but this
  was not the same. How tremendous the issue of this meeting!</p>

  <p>He heard the cabin door open. A broad light flared out into the gloom.
  Then Thiry appeared in the doorway, clearly defined. She wore white. She had
  changed her dress since supper. Trueman&rsquo;s heart gave a leap and then
  seemed to stand still while she stood peering out into the night. She closed
  the door behind her&mdash;vanished. But Rock heard quick light footfalls. She
  was coming.</p>

  <p>Presently her pale form grew more distinct. She groped slowly toward the
  seat. Evidently her eyes were not yet accustomed to the darkness. Rock saw
  her put out her hands, feeling for the tree or the bench.</p>

  <p>But before she touched either Rock reached up to take them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, evidently startled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  you&mdash;Mr. Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He did not let go of her hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;late. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been here twice,&rdquo;
  she said, with a nervous little laugh. No doubt she could not escape from the
  romance of this unusual situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but it took courage to come at all,&rdquo;
  returned Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it, though?... Mr. Rock, you&mdash;you are holding my
  hands. Please let go so I may sit down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He released her and leaned back against the pine, conscious that her
  presence had ended his uncertainty. She sat down, quite close to him, and
  bent her head forward a little, as if trying to pierce the gloom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Thiry, such eyes as yours ought to see through walls,&rdquo;
  said Trueman, sentimentally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ought they? Well, they can&rsquo;t.... And, Mr. Rock, this is no
  occasion for holding hands or paying compliments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There had been some slight change in her. Rock sensed less aloofness. The
  long hours, probably, had magnified; and constant thought had made him no
  longer a stranger. He would let her start the conversation. Then he would
  prolong it as far as fairness and consideration would permit. Suddenly the
  moon slipped up over the black rim, and magically the darkness lightened. A
  silver radiance touched the girl&rsquo;s hair and face. Rock, his own
  features in shadow, watched her and waited. The hour seemed to be the most
  momentous of his life. The night wind, sweet and balmy, was moving up from
  the Pass, roaring low in the tree-tops. How innumerable the nights he had
  listened to that music, always with a sense of its potency, of its message!
  And the time of its fulfillment had come.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash stole your horse?&rdquo; she began, tentatively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I wouldn&rsquo;t say stole. But he sure borrowed
  Egypt,&rdquo; returned Rock, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Egypt!</i>... I knew you named him that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lucy. I&rsquo;ve sure a stand-in with her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it appears.... I dare say you&rsquo;ll learn <i>all</i> our
  secrets,&rdquo; she said, a little irritated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Thiry, things just gravitate my way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Miss Thiry. If you must be formal make it Miss
  Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock guessed that his apparent coolness and nonchalance had struck her a
  little provokingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Miss Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be pleased that you called Leslie&rsquo;s horse by the
  name I gave him. Most everybody knows. Ash certainly knows.
  And&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t be pleased or flattered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lucy was, anyhow.... She said you loved the horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I do. I&rsquo;ve known him years, it seems. I used to ride him,
  too. How glorious it was!... But Ash caught me once&mdash;and then, well, I
  never got on him again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your world revolves around your brother Ash,&rdquo; mused Rock.
  &ldquo;Well, some day I&rsquo;ll put you up on Egypt, right here in your
  yard.... And some other day&mdash;maybe&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give him to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!... You couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t accept....But
  that threat proves you&mdash;just&mdash;just what I&rsquo;ve figured out you
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good or bad?&rdquo; queried Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad. You&rsquo;re a cowboy, many times over, dominated by a very
  devil.... Oh, your ears would burn if you knew all I thought.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re burnin&rsquo; now. But I&rsquo;d rather you thought
  bad than not at all. If a man can&rsquo;t make a woman think about him, then
  his case is hopeless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would <i>any</i> case ever be hopeless to you?&rdquo; she asked,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve helped a good many friends whose cases seemed
  hopeless to everyone but me,&rdquo; he answered, significantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With a gun, I suppose?&rdquo; she flashed, perhaps both thrilled
  and repelled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out here in the Southwest, sometimes you have to use a
  gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was silent a moment, evidently not quite sure how to take him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I asked Al what you did when you found out Ash took your
  horse,&rdquo; went on Thiry, presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did Al say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He said you were thunderstruck. You turned red as a beet, then
  white as a sheet.... And you swore something terrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Al told the truth, Thiry,&rdquo; admitted Rock, with reluctance.
  &ldquo;I never was so surprised&mdash;never so furious. New trick on me! My
  beautiful horse&mdash;that <i>you</i> had named&mdash;taken from me.... If
  you understand cowboys you may get some faint hunch of my
  feelin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, you see, then&mdash;how impossible Ash is!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody or nothin&rsquo; is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad says the man doesn&rsquo;t live who can stand Ash&rsquo;s
  meanness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; and maybe I can.... You saw him this
  mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I was up early, helping Ma get breakfast. When the horses came
  up it wasn&rsquo;t light yet. I heard Dad jawing somebody. Then Range came in
  and told us. I never said a word, but I was sick. At the table Dad was
  sarcastic. He said things I&rsquo;m sure Ash never heard before from anyone.
  But Ash never batted an eye. Then my mother had her turn. Finally I
  couldn&rsquo;t keep out of it, and I asked Ash why he&rsquo;d stolen your
  horse.... &lsquo;Callin&rsquo; me hoss thief, now?&rsquo; he said, and I
  thought he&rsquo;d strike me. I replied that it did look like stealing. This
  he didn&rsquo;t answer. Next I asked why he had taken him and&mdash;what he
  meant&mdash;to do with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here emotion accompanied Thiry&rsquo;s speech, she grew husky, and
  faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Luce told me he&rsquo;d called the hoss Egypt, which was
  your pet name,&rsquo; said Ash. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why I took him an&rsquo;
  why I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to break a leg for him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only Rock&rsquo;s powerful hold upon himself, fortified by hours of
  preparation for anything, kept his anger within bounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All because I gave him your pretty name! Tough on the horse.... And
  you were afraid to open your mouth!... Much you love Egypt!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, will you,&rdquo; she answered, not without anger.
  &ldquo;I pitched into Ash Preston as never before in our lives. I&mdash;I
  don&rsquo;t know what all I called him. He took it&mdash;and, oh, he looked
  dreadful. But he never said a word. He got up, nearly overturning the table,
  jumped on the horse, and was gone like a white streak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I stand corrected,&rdquo; replied Rock, thickly. &ldquo;I talk too
  quick. I&rsquo;m sure glad you had the nerve to call him. If you
  hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;But what did your father say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad took it all out in looking. He was flabbergasted. So were the
  boys. After they were gone Ma and Allie tried to console me, but I guess I
  was badly upset.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you cry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I?... It&rsquo;s a good thing you can&rsquo;t see my
  eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can see them.... Well, Thiry, I suppose you want to know what
  I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do about this horse deal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worry over that has made me sick all day. I don&rsquo;t want to
  hear, but I must.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When Ash gets back, I&rsquo;ll go up to him nice and pleasant.
  I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Look here, cowboy, if you want to borrow my horse, ask
  me for him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, would you say that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Or somethin&rsquo; like it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose he comes back without Egypt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I think I&rsquo;d better pass it off as if nothin&rsquo; had
  happened. I&rsquo;d ask your father. And if Egypt was crippled I&rsquo;d go
  find him and end his misery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s bad enough, without that wonderful horse being hurt.
  If you had to kill him&mdash;I&mdash;I think it&rsquo;d be
  horrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sure would. But at least it&rsquo;d be removin&rsquo; one red
  flag from in front of this bull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then followed a long silence. During this interval Thiry looked down at
  her idle hands, and from them up at Rock, and back again. The horse incident
  had thrown them off the track of the purpose of this interview.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, you&mdash;you were to tell me something tonight?&rdquo;
  she began, nervously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have several things to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me <i>one</i>. For I know that. I can feel
  it.... You&rsquo;re not going away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, with a ring in his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Mr. Rock, I feared you wouldn&rsquo;t. All day long
  I&rsquo;ve felt it.... But, oh, if you only knew!... It&rsquo;s not all for
  Ash&rsquo;s sake that I ask it. But for Dad and Mother, Alice and
  Lucy&mdash;for me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry,&rdquo; said Rock, with deep feeling, &ldquo;last night I
  almost gave in to you. It was terribly hard not to. But tonight I have hold
  of myself. You can&rsquo;t persuade me. You can&rsquo;t drive me. I shall
  stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re selfish. You think only of your silly
  infatuation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not selfishness or silly infatuation,&rdquo; he
  interrupted, with sudden passion that made her draw back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  thought all night and all day. Out of this torture has come two facts, which
  I believe as I do my own soul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe I can serve you best by stayin&rsquo; at Sunset
  Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She flung out her hands, protestingly, imploringly, and as if to ward off
  some incomprehensible peril.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;Rock!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;You dare make love to
  me&mdash;when we&rsquo;ve never been together an hour&mdash;when I&rsquo;m
  insisting you leave my home!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d dare that, yes, under any circumstances,&rdquo; he
  retorted, coolly. &ldquo;But as it happens, I&rsquo;m not makin&rsquo; love
  to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I declare, Mr. Rock, you are beyond me,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
  &ldquo;What in the world are you doing, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tellin&rsquo; you a simple fact. I&rsquo;m not likely to annoy you
  with it soon again. But I sort of welcome this chance to prove
  somethin&rsquo; to myself. You&rsquo;ll hear gossip about me and my love
  affairs, which you can believe if you like. But I know now I never had a real
  one before. It suits me to stake what I think I&rsquo;ve become against the
  old True Rock. This needn&rsquo;t worry you one little bit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You speak in riddles,&rdquo; she replied, incredulously. &ldquo;How
  can I help but worry&mdash;now, more than ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall leave you blissfully alone. I shall hardly be even polite
  if I see you at meal-time. Your brother Ash will soon see that there&rsquo;s
  one rider who&rsquo;s not mushy over you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To what end?&rdquo; she went on, sharply. &ldquo;Is that to deceive
  Ash, so you can stay here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Partly. But I&rsquo;m bound to confess that it&rsquo;s to spare
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not going to spare me,&rdquo; she cried.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not leave me alone. And even if you did Ash would believe
  it only a blind&mdash;that you were with me during his absence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But sure Ash couldn&rsquo;t believe you a liar?&rdquo; queried
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d make more of your avoiding me than if you were just
  friendly. It&rsquo;s a poor plan. Please give it up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She began to twist her hands in her white gown. The agitation, which
  before he had marked, was possessing her again. The idea that he had decided
  to stay at Sunset Pass held some singular dread for her. Was it as much
  because of a possible fight between him and Ash as for some other reason?
  Rock concluded it was both. And while he weighed this in mind he watched her
  with penetrating gaze, steeling his heart against the tenderness that
  threatened to overwhelm him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you really care for&mdash;for me&mdash;you will
  listen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Care for you!&rdquo; he returned, scornfully. &ldquo;You wait and
  see, Thiry Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait for what?&rdquo; she demanded, almost piteously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, I reckon, for a little time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With evident strong effort she controlled some almost irresistible fear or
  conflict. Her glance changed to one of deep and unfathomable mystery. She had
  discovered a latent strength. Rock divined she had been driven to extremity.
  And he grew sickeningly sure that she was involved somehow with Ash and her
  father in something which would not bear the light of day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock, I want you to leave Sunset Pass,&rdquo; she said,
  leaning to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve told me about a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s risk being discovered meeting at Wagontongue,&rdquo;
  she went on, and it seemed a certainty she was thrilled by her own deceit.
  &ldquo;You can get work anywhere. We&rsquo;ll take Mr. Winter into our
  confidence. We can meet in his store and spend an hour or two in his office.
  Then I&rsquo;ll arrange to stay with Mrs. Winter all night when I come to
  town. You can meet me there, too. I will go to Wagontongue every
  week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why would you be willin&rsquo; to do this unusual thing?&rdquo;
  asked Rock, eager to lead her on and on. &ldquo;I think I asked you that
  before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you&mdash;you wanted to be friends with
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your only chance. And I&rsquo;m giving you that to get
  you&mdash;to persuade you to leave here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, I ask you again&mdash;<i>why</i> do you want me to
  leave?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To keep you and Ash apart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that the only reason?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the&mdash;the big one,&rdquo; she replied, with both
  voice and glance unsteady. She was not an adept at lying, even in an issue of
  tremendous importance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that won&rsquo;t keep Ash and me apart. He will come to town
  when you do. He&rsquo;ll watch you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose the time when he is away with Dad. He won&rsquo;t
  know that I go to town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When he&rsquo;s away&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, on the range. Dad has large orders. The driving and&mdash;and
  the&mdash;the work will take up half his time from now on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What a child she was, thought Rock! As transparent as crystal water! But
  she was withal a woman, with all a woman&rsquo;s power to surprise and waylay
  to attain her ends. He ruthlessly laid traps for her, but the sole reason was
  not only to lead her into betrayal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would risk so much for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for you, though I know I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>will</i>
  like you, if you let me. It&rsquo;s for Ash and Dad&mdash;all of
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sweet of you, Thiry,&rdquo; he said, with just
  enough satire to belie the portent of his words, &ldquo;but very little to
  risk my life for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Trueman, it may save your life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You call me Trueman?&rdquo; he asked, amazed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Trueman.... We can deceive Ash.... The Winters will do
  anything for me. Ash will never catch us together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long would you expect this sort of thing to go on? We
  couldn&rsquo;t keep it up forever, could we? And when it came to an
  end&mdash;and I worshiped you&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d run the same risk as you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of?&mdash;being killed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! No! No! You&rsquo;re tantalizing me. You know what I
  mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t. Reckon some locoed cowboys would think you
  meant that you risked the danger of love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I meant just that, Mr. Trueman Rock,&rdquo; she blazed.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m human. Those nasty gossips in town, who call my love for Ash
  unnatural, can&rsquo;t understand.... I&rsquo;ve a heart, though everybody
  doubts it. And surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for me
  to&mdash;to love some one. Especially if he sacrificed for me&mdash;proved
  himself a man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry Preston, are you offerin&rsquo; such a hope to me?&rdquo; he
  asked, huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a hope, but a chance&mdash;only a chance&mdash;and
  all I <i>can</i> offer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But a chance&mdash;that means a lot,&rdquo; he went on, without
  remorse. &ldquo;I could be with you alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, as long as you wished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could I make love to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could I keep you&mdash;from it?&rdquo; she rejoined, her nerve
  visibly weakening. &ldquo;But if you were kind&mdash;as I first thought
  you&rsquo;d be&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t press&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you let me kiss you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Trueman had expected her to gasp and droop, or flare up affronted at
  this bold query, he had reckoned without his host. Again some bolt had shot
  back within her, tapping a reserve spirit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, white-faced and calm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you kiss <i>me</i>&mdash;now&mdash;to seal the
  compact?&rdquo; he went on, as mad in the ecstasy of the moment, as stern to
  convict her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You drive a hard bargain,&rdquo; she murmured, bitterly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never kissed any man save Ash and Dad... but I will kiss
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he replied, with a coolness that was the most
  magnificent deceit.</p>

  <p>She stood up, took brave, but hesitating steps, until her knees pressed
  against his, and as she bent over, instinctively her hands went out. Rock saw
  them trembling. She was going through with it. A moonbeam caught her face.
  Rock, who had perpetrated this monstrous hoax, uttered a cry of poignant
  repentance. One second more would make it too late. Her face loomed close,
  strong in purpose, with veiled eyes, sadder than ever.</p>

  <p>Rock seized her hands, and bending his head, he kissed one and then the
  other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I would give almost my very life
  to have you kiss me. But not for this.... I led you on. I wanted to see how
  far you would go.... You poor, loving, blinded girl! What would you not
  sacrifice for this damned Ash Preston?&mdash;I tell you&mdash;you shall
  not.... I will stay here! You have no idea what a horrible temptation you
  gave me. To meet you often&mdash;to have you alone&mdash;to be able to kiss
  you! My God!... <i>Thiry!</i> I could make you love me.... But so help me
  God, I wouldn&rsquo;t have your love at such sacrifice. I&rsquo;ll win it
  square and fair&mdash;or never.... Now, I&rsquo;ll go, and I&rsquo;ll not
  speak to you soon again. Trust me, Thiry. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kissed her hands again and rushed away into the moon-streaked
  shadows.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">FOUR days passed, days full of hard labor for Rock and
  pondering thought, and slow absorbing adaptation to the most difficult and
  strangest situation he had ever encountered.</p>

  <p>He conquered his sense of hurry, of having no time. Here he required a
  long hop, step and jump. Early at breakfast and late at supper he saw Thiry
  and then only to exchange a greeting. He did not look to see if she looked at
  him, though curiosity and longing consumed him.</p>

  <p>By doing most of the fence work he made himself more than solid with the
  three brothers, particularly Al, who had taken a strong liking to him. He let
  them ride off up into the timber to cut pine saplings and snake them down to
  the pasture, while he dug the post holes and built the fence.</p>

  <p>Opportunity would some day come for him to ride down to the old well on
  Slagle&rsquo;s ranch, and find out what was in it. He persuaded himself that
  he wanted to have plenty of time and be perfectly safe to pursue his
  investigations, but as a matter of fact he really was reluctant to find
  material proof of the Prestons&rsquo; guilt.</p>

  <p>Rock dreamed as well as thought while at work, and every day seemed to
  make more certain the thing that had transformed him. The hours alone were
  satisfying to him, but when he had to play his part with the boys, and the
  harder one before the other Prestons at home, then he found it most trying.
  How much better to have been riding the range!</p>

  <p>It was now near the end of June and the summer rains were due. This
  season, next to autumn, was the most beautiful for a rider in the open. The
  range needed rain. The grass was bleached white, the waterholes were dry or
  stagnant pools, the streams, even in the Pass, were getting low. The boys who
  rode the range said it was burning up. The hottest weather, though, had
  passed. Each morning white clouds peeped up over the eastern gateway of the
  Pass, and then from all around they appeared to climb toward the zenith,
  gloriously white against the deep blue, swelling, darkening, mushrooming. But
  not yet had they brought the welcome rain. Each sunset added something of
  beauty and change to the one before. Rock gloated over them as a miser over
  his gold. Sunset Pass at sunset resembled his most poignant dreams; but it
  also gave him pause and forced him to watch and feel and realize. So that
  when he plodded in late to supper he was hard put to it to conceal his
  sadness.</p>

  <p>On the fifth morning Al remarked, laconically, &ldquo;We sure gotta hustle
  today, for Pa will be home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why the particular hustle today, Al?&rdquo; queried Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pa has a way of slippin&rsquo; up on us, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;d sure
  never do to be ketched loafin&rsquo;. He wouldn&rsquo;t let us go to the
  rodeo and dance on the Fourth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten about that,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, with
  enthusiasm. &ldquo;Are all the folks goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pa and Ma ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;, but sure the rest of us Prestons
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Includin&rsquo; Ash?&rdquo; asked Rock, casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He never missed one yet that Thiry went to&mdash;leastways a dance.
  Allie and the kids will stop at Leslie&rsquo;s. Thiry said she was
  goin&rsquo; to Winter&rsquo;s. Reckon you&rsquo;ll ride in with us? We aim to
  start on the first, so&rsquo;s to get in the day before the
  Fourth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask your dad,&rdquo; returned Rock, thoughtfully. It
  would be very much better, perhaps, for him to remain on the ranch. Yet the
  urge laid hold of him, persuasively at first, and then, augmented by a very
  contrary spirit, it grew compelling. He could look on at the rodeo, and take
  just a peep in at the dance, to see Thiry in a party dress. But then he would
  be certain to see her in the arms of some moonstruck cowboy. That sent a hot
  twinge through Rock&mdash;an unfamiliar sensation. It was his introduction to
  jealousy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon, on second thought, I will go,&rdquo; he said to Al, and
  certain it was that this sudden, almost involuntary decision made him realize
  how far he was from knowing himself.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon the brothers left off work and rode home. This time
  Rock went with them, listening to their cheerful talk about the prospect of
  the good time in town. The next day was Sunday, which Gage Preston made a day
  of rest when the riders were in off the range. And Tuesday was the 1st of
  July.</p>

  <p>They reached the barns, to ascertain that Ash and the others had not yet
  come in. Rock, after caring for his horse, slowly sauntered up the slope to
  his cabin, finding himself subservient to an oppressive mood. Ash Preston
  would soon be back. What had he done with Egypt? And over against this cold
  speculation, with its incalculable possibilities, balanced the warmth of his
  assurances to Thiry. How could he fail her? Yet, equally impossible&mdash;how
  could he be otherwise than True Rock? While he was soberly debating the
  matter, and cleaning up for supper, he heard the clip-clop of trotting
  horses, then a rattle of wheels. With a start he went to the door. Scoot
  Preston was driving up on the seat of a big empty wagon. Two more wagons had
  topped the slope. Soon they halted before the cabins. Rock waited for riders
  to appear. And he was not disappointed. The burly form of the older Preston
  hove in sight, riding a roan and leading two saddle-horses. A little
  afterward, sight of Ash on Egypt shot a quick stab through Rock. The next
  instant he relaxed. The white horse appeared tired, but none the worse for
  the absence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; exclaimed Trueman, aloud, and his relief told him just
  how much he had cared&mdash;how he had resolutely put thought of Egypt from
  him. &ldquo;Reckon I might as well go out and get it over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But first he went inside. While pondering over how best to meet this
  situation and still be true to Thiry, he had buckled on his gun-belt.
  Suddenly the fact dawned on him, and he laid hard hands on the belt buckle.
  But he got no farther. There was more here to be true to than Thiry Preston;
  there was the code of the West. He had no right to face this vicious unknown
  problem, Ash Preston, without being armed.</p>

  <p>Whereupon he strolled out leisurely. As he came in sight of the arriving
  Prestons, halfway between the cabins, Gage espied him, and with a start he
  wheeled about from the family, who were welcoming him, to dismount like any
  cowboy, and hurried to intercept Rock. As he drew near, his deep gray eyes
  betrayed considerable anxiety.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock, how are you?&rdquo; was his greeting, accompanied by
  extended hand. &ldquo;The boys say you-all got on fine. I&rsquo;m sure
  glad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boss!&rdquo; returned Rock, cordially. &ldquo;We got the
  fence job &rsquo;most done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! You don&rsquo;t say? Wal, I&rsquo;ll be dog-goned. How&rsquo;d
  you ever get thet out of them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston fell in step with Rock, though it was significant that he kept a
  couple of yards distant. Rock replied with good humor, somewhat eulogizing
  the young Prestons. In this manner they approached the double cabin, where on
  the wide porch were collected the women and children. Ash was the only one of
  the returning brothers who got down on the ground. His movement was almost
  stealthy. Perhaps more significant than his father&rsquo;s action was his
  slow step forward and to one side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, I shore hope you won&rsquo;t rile Ash&mdash;leastways hyar
  before the women,&rdquo; said Preston, hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, boss,&rdquo; returned Rock, with a genial laugh.
  He had caught a glimpse of Thiry, who kept somewhat in the background.</p>

  <p>Egypt was standing, bridle down, halfway between Ash and the porch. One
  glance told Rock that he was gaunt, dirty, and rough, but apparently as sound
  as ever. He whinnied at sight of Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boys!&rdquo; said Rock, nodding to the drivers on the
  wagons. Then halting beside Egypt, he turned to face Ash Preston. Despite his
  iron control a slight quiver strung his frame. How cool, intent, potential of
  evil menace this man! He stood at ease, hands on his hips, his black sombrero
  slouched back, his blue-flame eyes piercing Rock, as if to read his mind.
  Rock had met penetrating glances before, and this one shot little cold sparks
  along his marrow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Ash! Did you like my horse?&rdquo; he said, with perfect
  composure and entire absence of rancor.</p>

  <p>Not improbably that was the last query Ash Preston would ever have
  anticipated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Best hoss I ever forked,&rdquo; he replied, without feeling of any
  kind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. Hope you were good to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock, the fact is I begun bad,&rdquo; drawled Ash. &ldquo;But
  he piled me in the brush. An&rsquo; runnin him over rough ground didn&rsquo;t
  phase him none. An&rsquo; I reckon I ended treatin&rsquo; him
  good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he pitch with you?&rdquo; queried Rock, in genuine
  surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got any outlaw beat I ever rode.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&mdash;Leslie swore this horse never pitched in his
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon thet was no lie, Rock. But I nagged him. He threw me,
  an&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t get near him again thet day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Served you right,&rdquo; responded Rock, naturally. &ldquo;It
  doesn&rsquo;t pay to be mean to horses. And see here, Ash, don&rsquo;t go
  borrowin&rsquo; a horse from a rider without askin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tension relaxed, the charged atmosphere lost its fullness and
  suspense. Gage Preston laughed loud, as if explosion was relief. The women
  began to murmur. And Ash, though he betrayed little of what might have been
  his true state, eyed Rock with slow, cool smile, and slouched with clinking
  steps to the porch.</p>

  <p>Thiry met him, reached for him in glad excitement: &ldquo;Oh, Ash,
  I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re back&mdash;and you&mdash;and everything all
  right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ash wrapped his long arms around her, and hugging her closely, he bent his
  head over her. The action seemed eloquent, beautiful, and yet it carried a
  hint of bold raw nature. It pierced Rock like fire. Bending down to feel the
  legs of his horse, he kept that studious posture until he had recovered.
  Without a glance backward, then, he led Egypt down toward the barns. And he
  brooded in mind, muttering his thoughts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cold, shiny rattlesnake ready to strike!&mdash;Sol Winter sure had
  him figured.... I just wonder. Reckon he thought I&rsquo;d rave and curse.
  Sure he&rsquo;d have come back at me.... And then a fist fight or
  gun-play!&mdash;Damn him, he wanted it.... Now what in h&mdash;&mdash; can
  you do with a fellow like that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Rock&rsquo;s heat and rancor lost itself in something
  worse&mdash;jealousy. It had seared him to see Thiry run to Ash, almost with
  arms outstretched, her face flushed, her eyes alight, her voice broken, to
  receive that strange caress. Yet was it a caress? What violence of emotion
  attacked Rock! He could not trust himself on the moment. He only knew he had
  fallen into sudden misery and must extricate himself.</p>

  <p>Rock spent so much time caring for Egypt, cleaning and brushing him, and
  making him a comfortable bed of grass in a stall, that it was dark when he
  got back to his cabin. The supper bell rang. He had no appetite, and at this
  moment he strongly resented the need to keep on with the rôle he had assumed
  for Thiry Preston&rsquo;s sake. What use! He could not carry it on forever.
  Tomorrow, or next week, or month Ash Preston would go beyond the
  pale&mdash;beyond any man&rsquo;s endurance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, I&rsquo;m sore,&rdquo; growled Rock, and swore at himself. He
  had planned to overlook and overcome Ash&rsquo;s appropriating his horse so
  affrontingly. But that was nothing compared to seeing Thiry in her
  brother&rsquo;s arms. He had not calculated upon such a contingency. Still,
  Ash was only her brother; it was only a blood tie. Nevertheless, it rankled.
  He could not explain his reaction to this perfectly normal attachment between
  brother and sister. So he put it down to the account of his own defects.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Rock, presently, that to live up to his apparently amenable
  attitude he must present himself at the supper table. To this end he hurried
  out, and fought himself all the way over, to present an agreeable front.
  Fortunately he did not arrive late, as the Prestons were just seating
  themselves at table, all of them more or less gay.</p>

  <p>For the first time in five days Rock looked deliberately into
  Thiry&rsquo;s face. She gave him a grateful smile, wistful and wondering, as
  if she would make amends for doubt. It softened Rock, and though he did not
  glance at her again, he managed to get through the meal cheerfully.
  Afterward, to his relief, Preston called him into his cabin. It had two
  rooms, connected by a curtained alcove. The hands of women surely had given
  this interior its color and comfort.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a drink with me, Rock,&rdquo; invited Preston. He was in high
  spirits.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry boss, but I&rsquo;ve quit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s so. I forget. Lord save me from influencin&rsquo; any
  man to break his word. Have a cigar, then. I shore recommend
  these.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Rock, accepting one. &ldquo;Did you have a
  successful trip?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Best ever, but thet won&rsquo;t interest you,&rdquo; returned
  Preston, briefly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say, though, thet when the trip ended
  hyar I was some worried. An&rsquo; when I seen you packin&rsquo; a gun, I was
  scared stiff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, boss, but that oughtn&rsquo;t have bothered you. It&rsquo;s
  just habit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!&rdquo; returned Preston, giving Rock a dubious look.
  &ldquo;But it was hard to figger you. Ash shore wasn&rsquo;t able to.
  An&rsquo; you clean knocked the pins from under him. He didn&rsquo;t,
  an&rsquo; neither did any of us, expect you to take thet dirty deal so nice
  an&rsquo; friendly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else could I do?&rdquo; demanded Rock, spreading wide his
  hands. &ldquo;I came out here to make friends, not enemies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m shore thankin&rsquo; you. When we rode off last week
  I was shore mad at Ash. But I got over it, an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;m
  hopin&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be as bad as I feared. You&rsquo;ve got Ash
  stumped. I heard him ask Lucy if you&rsquo;d been runnin&rsquo; after
  Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! What did Lucy say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lucy said you hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;thet you were seldom hyar,
  an&rsquo; then never paid no attention to Thiry. Is thet so, Rock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it is, since you left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You an&rsquo; Thiry quarreled, I take it,&rdquo; went on Preston.
  &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say so, but she has a way of makin&rsquo; the boys
  leave her alone. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be so easy, an&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;ll gamble it won&rsquo;t last. Just before supper Thiry told me
  you&rsquo;d acted wonderful with Ash&mdash;thet she&rsquo;d misjudged you.
  Don&rsquo;t remember when I&rsquo;ve seen the lass so strange. The truth is,
  Rock, I think she likes you an&rsquo; hates the falseness of the situation.
  You&rsquo;ve shore begun right, if you&rsquo;re in earnest about
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock could scarcely believe his ears. Yet there was no mistaking Preston.
  He implied even more than he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In earnest? Good Lord! I wish I knew how to tell you how earnest I
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon now I savvy why you met Ash that way. Guess I had the
  hunch. Rock, you&rsquo;re an upstandin&rsquo; fine chap an&rsquo; I like you.
  Thet bad habit you used to have don&rsquo;t hurt you in my estimation. So
  don&rsquo;t be backward tellin&rsquo; me just how you feel about
  Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, the minute I laid eyes on Thiry I fell in love with
  her,&rdquo; replied Rock, with sincere depth and frankness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  changed my whole life. I used to be a free, careless hombre, runnin&rsquo;
  after girls, ridin&rsquo; here and there, drinkin&rsquo;, gamblin&rsquo;,
  fightin&rsquo;.&mdash;But that&rsquo;s past.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks fer talkin&rsquo; out,&rdquo; rejoined Preston, puffing at
  his cigar and bending deep inscrutable eyes upon Rock. &ldquo;Course you mean
  marriage, cowboy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock jerked in his chair; his face reddened. &ldquo;Preston&mdash;I never
  let myself have&mdash;such hope,&rdquo; he burst out, almost choking over his
  cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Faint heart never won fair lady,&rdquo; quoted the rancher. Then he
  frowned and added, tersely, &ldquo;Declare yourself, like a man, if you want
  my interest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite savvy,&rdquo; replied Rock,
  uncertainly. &ldquo;What more can I say?... Unless&mdash;I suppose, Preston,
  when a man falls honest in love he should have honorable intentions. If I had
  any they sure would be honorable. But, Lord, I never dared even dream of
  Thiry as my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d like to marry her?&rdquo; queried this astounding
  ranchman.</p>

  <p>Rock stared a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be the happiest and luckiest fellow
  on earth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned Preston, gruffly.
  &ldquo;I was about changin&rsquo; my mind thet you wasn&rsquo;t such a sudden
  fellar, after all. Do you want my advice?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, I&mdash;I&rsquo;d be most grateful for
  anythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Rock, bewildered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry ought to be told.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, no!... So soon? Before I&rsquo;ve proved
  what&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;d only distress her&mdash;do my cause
  harm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you don&rsquo;t know women,&rdquo; said Preston. &ldquo;The
  very fact thet you came to me an&rsquo; declared yourself, straight like your
  name, will go far with Thiry, an&rsquo; all of us &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; Ash.
  An&rsquo; even Ash couldn&rsquo;t help but see thet was right. He beat a
  cowboy once who dallied after Thiry without talkin&rsquo;
  marriage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like as not he&rsquo;d try to beat me&mdash;if I did tell
  her,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, with a nervous laugh. The very idea threw him into
  a fever of panic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m appreciatin&rsquo; your fine feelin&rsquo;s, Rock,
  so I&rsquo;ll tell her myself,&rdquo; replied the rancher, and turning to the
  open door he called, &ldquo;Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston!&rdquo; gasped Rock, rising.</p>

  <p>At this moment Lucy poked her disheveled head and bright face in at the
  door. &ldquo;Daddy, did you call?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which one? Thiry is here. But I don&rsquo;t see Alice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, reckon Thiry will do. Send her in,&rdquo; said Preston,
  dryly.</p>

  <p>Rock, standing as if paralyzed, heard the child call gayly, and then
  light, quick footfalls. Immediately the dark doorway framed a slender form in
  white, with wistful, expectant face and great, doubtful eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in, lass, an&rsquo; shut the door,&rdquo; said her father, as
  he knocked the ashes from his cigar. There seemed nothing momentous in voice
  or manner.</p>

  <p>She complied, and came forward hesitatingly, her glance going from her
  father to Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, come hyar,&rdquo; he went on, and when she drew close he put
  an arm around her. &ldquo;Do you see thet big cowpuncher standin&rsquo; over
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t very well help it,&rdquo; she
  replied, and she just escaped being demure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sort of pale round the gills, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; continued
  Preston, still in his dry, genial tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid he looks a&mdash;a little
  guilty,&rdquo; replied Thiry, constrainedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s not exactly guilt,&rdquo; laughed Preston, as he
  squeezed her slim waist. &ldquo;Lass, Rock has asked your hand in
  marriage&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve given it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dad!</i>&rdquo; she whispered, and leaned against him as if
  suddenly bereft of strength. Then she rallied, while the scarlet waved up
  from neck to cheek. &ldquo;Are you crazy&mdash;or am I? You couldn&rsquo;t
  joke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her blazing eyes flashed in doubt and fear from her father to Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Thiry,&rdquo; replied Rock, finding himself under those
  wonderful eyes, &ldquo;this is the most solemn&mdash;and terrible moment of
  my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock made her a gallant bow. Slowly she released herself from her
  father&rsquo;s arm, with widening, darkening eyes, that seemed fascinated by
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;s sudden, lass,&rdquo; spoke up Preston. &ldquo;But
  thet&rsquo;s this cowboy&rsquo;s way. An&rsquo; fer one I kinda like it.
  Rock&rsquo;s some different from the others, Thiry. No ridin&rsquo; round out
  hyar, makin&rsquo; everlastin&rsquo; excuses to get back to the ranch,
  pryin&rsquo; you out at odd moments, worryin&rsquo; your mother an&rsquo;
  me&mdash;an&rsquo; drivin&rsquo; Ash to drink. No, ma&rsquo;m, True Rock
  comes straight to <i>me</i>. I like thet. Your ma will, too, when I tell
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you think&mdash;<i>Ash</i> will say?&rdquo; she broke
  out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash?&mdash;Wal, child, he&rsquo;s not your dad or your boss.
  You&rsquo;re no kid any more. You&rsquo;re a woman, free to do as you want.
  You shore don&rsquo;t have to ask anythin&rsquo; of Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Thiry, incredulously, almost with horror.</p>

  <p>In that exclamation of protest, of unbelief, of consternation, Rock delved
  further into this Preston mystery. It seemed to betray Preston&rsquo;s guilt
  along with that of his son, and Thiry&rsquo;s knowledge of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, lass, will you answer Rock now or do you want some time to
  think it over?&rdquo; asked Preston, coolly, unabashed or unconcerned by her
  agitation. He was deep. He was playing a game that Rock sensed but could not
  fathom. His effect upon Thiry was also beyond Rock&rsquo;s ken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock, I thank you,&rdquo; said Thiry, through trembling pale
  lips, &ldquo;for the honor you do me.... I&rsquo;m sorry I cannot
  accept.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock bowed, with what little dignity he could assume.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, wait a minute,&rdquo; said her father, as she made for the
  door. He caught her and held her, unmistakable affection in his grasp.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to upset you. But these things will happen.
  Don&rsquo;t think your dad wants to get rid of you. I&rsquo;m powerful fond
  of you, Thiry. You always was my favorite. It&rsquo;s only thet
  lately&mdash;wal, I don&rsquo;t want to worry you about what might happen to
  me. I might not always be hyar to take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, what do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; much,&rdquo; he replied, enigmatically.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have your future settled before&mdash;before long.
  An&rsquo; Rock struck me about right.... Aw, there you&rsquo;re cryin&rsquo;.
  Wal, run along. I shore can&rsquo;t stand a cryin&rsquo; woman, not even you.
  An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no great compliment to Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thiry held her head high as she walked by Rock without giving him another
  word or glance, and he saw that she was weeping.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, I ought to knock the daylights out of you,&rdquo; declared
  Rock, wrathfully, when Thiry was gone. &ldquo;What&rsquo;n hell did you do
  that for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, you shore are an appreciatin&rsquo; cuss,&rdquo; returned
  the rancher, with sarcasm. Signs were not lacking that he had hidden deep
  emotion from Thiry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I ever had any hope to win Thiry, it&rsquo;s sure gone
  now,&rdquo; fumed Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much you know about women,&rdquo; said Preston. &ldquo;About girls,
  mebbe you did. But when it comes to women, love, an&rsquo;
  marryin&rsquo;&mdash;wal, my boy, you&rsquo;re a green hand. I had a hunch
  Thiry took a shine to you, an&rsquo; now I know it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re drunk or crazy, as Thiry said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock, if she hasn&rsquo;t before she will now,&rdquo; replied
  Preston, imperturbably. &ldquo;Thiry&rsquo;s whole-hearted an&rsquo;
  fancy-free. I take it she just can&rsquo;t help herself. She knows now you
  want to <i>marry</i> her. Thet always fetches a woman, provided she
  ain&rsquo;t in love with some one else. Thiry is some like her mother,
  an&rsquo; a lot like me. Slow to care for anybody.... Have another cigar,
  cowboy. I see you&rsquo;ve mashed thet one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock discovered that not only had he crushed the cigar, but he had burned
  his fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, I can&rsquo;t be mad at you, but I sure want to be,&rdquo;
  returned Rock, resigning himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Set down. I want to tell you about Ash,&rdquo; said the rancher.
  &ldquo;Thet hombre shore put up one on himself. We all reckoned he meant bad
  by your white hoss, an&rsquo; right off he started bein&rsquo; mean. Did you
  know thet hoss?... Wal, I&rsquo;m damned if he didn&rsquo;t throw Ash nine
  times. I only saw him get piled twice, but between me an&rsquo; the boys it
  figgered up nine. You never seen the like of thet pitchin&rsquo; hoss. He
  wouldn&rsquo;t stand fer Ash an&rsquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t stand under him. The
  second day Ash couldn&rsquo;t even get a rope on him. An&rsquo; he had to
  change his tactics. Reckon thet hoss is smart. Anyway, he knowed when Ash
  changed his mind, an&rsquo; then he stopped buckin&rsquo;. After thet Ash
  rode thet hoss as I never saw one rode before. He wanted to break his leg.
  An&rsquo; he put him to the rocks an&rsquo; ditches an&rsquo;
  logs&mdash;somethin&rsquo; awful. I cussed Ash till I was out of breath. No
  good. But he couldn&rsquo;t hurt the hoss an&rsquo; he shore did hurt
  himself. So he gave up. He showed respect fer a hoss the one an&rsquo; only
  time in his life. So, Rock, it&rsquo;s ended far better than we ever dreamed
  it could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But will he take Egypt again?&rdquo; asked Rock,
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash will do anythin&rsquo;. But you keep your hoss fer yourself. If
  you have to put him out on the range at night. You could hobble him
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, try keepin&rsquo; tabs on Egypt hyar at home. An&rsquo; if
  thet doesn&rsquo;t work.&mdash;You&rsquo;ll shore be goin&rsquo; in to town
  with the rest of the outfit. They&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; day after tomorrow.
  Thet reminds me. I run into thet pretty Mrs. Dabb, an&rsquo; she said to tell
  you to be shore an&rsquo; come to her dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of her. Where&rsquo;s it to be held? At
  Dabb&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. Not big enough. She&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; the new town hall
  decorated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, in that case I might go,&rdquo; replied Trueman,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, cowboy, wasn&rsquo;t this Dabb woman an old flame of
  yours?&rdquo; inquired Preston, with inquisitive good humor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, she wasn&rsquo;t exactly mine, but that wasn&rsquo;t my
  fault.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho! Ho! I know the lady. Thet is to say I&rsquo;ve seen her with
  the cowpunchers. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s shore a high-steppin&rsquo; little
  filly. Reckon John Dabb was a damned old fool, marryin&rsquo; thet young
  lady.... Wal, Rock, if she happened to be a little sweet on you yet
  it&rsquo;d shore be lucky fer you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, I fail to see how,&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, aghast. This
  rancher was certainly manifesting a complex and many-sided character.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, just you fool around Mrs. Dabb some an&rsquo; make Thiry
  jealous,&rdquo; replied Preston, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By thunder!&rdquo; exploded Rock, yet partly with a laugh.
  &ldquo;Preston, you&rsquo;re a regular old devil, or else I don&rsquo;t savvy
  you. Even if I could make Thiry jealous&mdash;which&rsquo;s preposterous,
  I&rsquo;d never do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a darn sight of a fool,&rdquo; returned Preston,
  complacently. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt your cause none to let my lass see
  other women like you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, you must have been a devil among the women, in your
  day,&rdquo; said Rock, slyly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I was, but my career ended sweet an&rsquo;
  sudden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, how would you handle this particular case of mine,
  regardin&rsquo; the dance?&rdquo; inquired Rock, prompted by a spirit of
  mischief. He was getting a most unexpected, surprising, and pleasurable jolt
  out of this new contact with Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you a good dancer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I used to be. Reckon I haven&rsquo;t forgot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, as you&rsquo;re a handsome cuss, too, you want to make
  the most of your chance. It&rsquo;s to be a masquerade, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Masquerade? I sure didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You get yourself up in some dandy outfit. Don&rsquo;t be a cowboy,
  or a greaser, or Indian. You might be a flash gambler, or a parson, fer their
  clothes look good on a fellar. Then first off be cold to Thiry an&rsquo;
  sweeter&rsquo;n pie to your old girl. But you want to be slick, cowboy.
  Don&rsquo;t carry it too far. Don&rsquo;t overdo it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock laughed rather wildly. The absurdity of the thing so blandly
  suggested by Preston did not quite submerge a certain enticement. The nerve
  of it, the very audacity, the reckless assumption that he might make this
  wonderful girl jealous, took on him a hold hard to shake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old-timer, I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; replied
  Rock, with a grimace, as he flung his second cigar into the fireplace.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be funny; it&rsquo;d be great, if I dared. But it would be
  very unkind to Mrs. Dabb and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it would be,&rdquo; interposed Preston. &ldquo;But if you
  don&rsquo;t make up to her, some one else will. An&rsquo;, cowboy, smoke this
  in your pipe&mdash;thet feller might not be as clean-minded as you
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I think I&rsquo;ll rustle now, before you get me locoed.
  Good night,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>As he opened the door, abruptly, he almost bumped into Ash Preston. Rock
  could not help wondering if Ash had been eavesdropping.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Rock, strikes me you&rsquo;ve been in there pretty
  long,&rdquo; said Ash, with blue-flashing glance as direct as his speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Ash!&rdquo; retorted Rock, with instant laugh. &ldquo;I
  shore was. It takes long to extract advance money from your dad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! Mebbe I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; returned Ash.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shore some job to get money due. An&rsquo; dammit, you hit
  him first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Ash, I have some left. Come in,&rdquo; said Preston.
  &ldquo;Good night, Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman strolled in the black shadows of the pines near his cabin. The
  night was pleasant, the wind at its old task in the tree-tops, the frogs
  along the creek were croaking drowsily of midsummer. The dark Pass, obscure
  and dreaming, seemed pregnant with life.</p>

  <p>It took him an hour to throw off the spell incited by the rancher. To
  think he had been a party to a proposal of marriage to Thiry Preston! What if
  he had not been the genius of it?</p>

  <p>The plot had thickened, and Rock saw no way of extricating himself, even
  had he so desired. He had shocked Thiry beyond measure. How impossible to
  confess that he had not made any offer of marriage! All things considered,
  now he was glad. He hoped all the Prestons would know it before they retired.
  In some unaccountable way he had won Gage Preston&rsquo;s regard and
  friendship. Nevertheless, he concluded that Preston had some deep motive
  besides a longing to see Thiry safely settled for life. What could that
  motive be? No matter how Rock looked at the problem, one fact stood
  out&mdash;whatever furthered his courting of Thiry Preston could only render
  Ash Preston more dangerous. Did Gage Preston&rsquo;s motive hide in that?</p>

  <p>Rock tried to give it up and went to bed, where he listened to the
  sing-song of pines overhead and thrilled to the ridiculous yet enchanting
  suggestion of Preston&rsquo;s. To make Thiry jealous! The idea was just as
  tantalizingly sweet as it was dishearteningly silly. No girl could be made
  jealous unless she cared. And absolutely and insupportably he was sure she
  did not care for him.</p>

  <p>One by one Rock&rsquo;s thoughts, ecstatic and dismaying by turns, brought
  him back to the conviction that Preston was deeply involved in crooked work
  and that Thiry knew it. If so, why did not the father aid and abet the
  daughter in getting rid of a new rider who was not exactly a dunce, at least
  in ways of the range? So the mystery augmented along with Rock&rsquo;s
  perplexity. Eventually his speculations wore him to slumber.</p>

  <p>He awakened at dawn with an idea which must have generated in his
  subconscious mind while asleep. And it was that he should start toward
  Wagontongue ahead of the Prestons instead of waiting until they had gone. He
  wanted to stop long enough with Slagle to dig through the husk of that
  rancher&rsquo;s provocative reticence. Likewise, he wanted to ride over that
  part of the range which had been the scene of Preston&rsquo;s latest labors.
  With Preston at home, busy with manifold tasks left him, and his family on
  the road, there would be opportunity for Rock to confirm or disprove his
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>At breakfast Rock asked permission to leave that day, instead of on the
  morrow, and it was readily given. He hurried down to the barns without having
  had a glimpse of either Ash or Thiry. The white horse had been watered and
  fed, doubtless by Al, whom Rock saw doing his early-morning chores.</p>

  <p>Saddling Egypt, and leading the rested and mettlesome horse up to the
  cabin, Rock tied a couple of blankets behind the cantle, and rode away under
  the pines, without being noticed, so far as he could tell, by any of the
  family.</p>

  <p>What he devoutly hoped was that Preston had not worked close to the Pass.
  The Flats, Rock had ascertained, were the wide gray cedar-dotted levels some
  miles this side of Slagle&rsquo;s ranch. Tom Preston had been given orders to
  drive the green wagon as far as the Flats. Trotting briskly along, his eyes
  ever and anon keen on the broad wheel tracks, Rock soon arrived at the bottom
  of the slope, where the ground spread wide and flat for miles.</p>

  <p>He found where the wagon had left the road to halt in the first clump of
  cedars, and then it had gone on again, back to the road. Horse tracks and
  wheel tracks were old stories to Rock. He could almost read through them the
  minds of riders and drivers.</p>

  <p>A mile or more this side of Slagle&rsquo;s ranch, which was hidden in the
  rough hilly country west of the Flats, the wagon tracks and hoof tracks of
  saddle-horses turned off the road. Rock did not care to follow them until the
  Prestons had passed, and even then he would be extremely careful how he did
  follow. Ash Preston might have eyes as good as his own.</p>

  <p>Rock, surveying the country ahead, concluded that unless Preston had made
  a cut-off to avoid passing Slagle&rsquo;s ranch, soon to meet the road again,
  he had surely been stopped shortly by rough going.</p>

  <p>To Rock&rsquo;s disappointment, he found that Slagle was not at home. The
  rancher had probably taken his family to town, for there was ample evidence
  that he was absent only temporarily. Rock had nothing else to do but ride on,
  thinking that he might stop at Pringle&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>A couple of miles down the road Rock met the wagon tracks again, coming
  from across the Flats.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By golly! looks like a short-cut, doesn&rsquo;t it? I guess
  not!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock derisively. Then he discovered that these tracks
  were fresh, and made on the return home. The wagons had been empty. This was
  longer and harder going than round the road. Rock passed on a few hundred
  yards, to find where the Prestons had driven into the road on their outward
  trip. And still farther on he came to more tracks, older by some weeks.</p>

  <p>Off to the west, on the gray rolling range, Rock espied straggling herds
  of cattle. Somewhere along here the Prestons had done their latest job of
  butchering beeves; and Rock was intensely eager to find the spot.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER pondering awhile, Rock decided he might safely risk
  some careful scouting around, provided he left no traces and kept keen survey
  of the several miles of road.</p>

  <p>With this in mind he tied Egypt on hard ground, and taking to the thickest
  part of the cedars he mounted the hill. Emerging on top, to the right of the
  summit, he searched the rolling rangeland with the telescopic eyes of a
  range-rider. Rolling sea of bleached grass and gray sage, cedared ridges,
  green washes, clumps of cattle colorfully dotting levels and slopes, and
  endless monotony that waved away to the black rough horizon&mdash;these
  familiar objects were precisely what he had expected to see.</p>

  <p>He concluded he would have to follow the wagon tracks, to find where the
  Prestons had last butchered, but the present was not the time to undertake
  that. Keeping within the cedars, he went on to the summit of the ridge.</p>

  <p>The wind was strong in his face. It carried more than heat, and as he
  gained his objective point, he both smelled and saw dust in the air. Then
  something faint, but raw, an odor that was tainted!</p>

  <p>Eagerly Rock came up behind a cedar, and from this cover he peered out and
  down. The slope on that side sheered steep and rough, down to an open draw,
  up which his keen sight roved. This draw appeared pale green, with a dry
  winding wash in the center. It led up to a wide pocket, where yellow water
  gleamed. Cows were bawling. White objects flashed in the sunlight, drawing
  Rock&rsquo;s gaze the quicker. Then he discerned a cabin and corral, covered
  with white spots, also men on horses, and some on foot.</p>

  <p>Rock slipped to his knees, and crawling to a low thick cedar bush he half
  buried himself in it, and peered out. The good, or perhaps bad, luck that had
  always attended him on the range was operating now. Likewise were his sharp
  eyes and the keen brain behind them.</p>

  <p>The white objects were cowhides, thrown over the corral fence, and nailed
  on the cabin, hair side down. There were seven riders, several still sitting
  their saddles, the others walking around. Voices floated up faintly to Rock
  as he crouched there, suddenly covered with cold sweat. Bunch of cowboys
  snooping around! Many and many the time Rock had been a party to just this
  thing. Curiosity was a characteristic of any cowboy on a range where cattle
  mysteriously disappeared.</p>

  <p>The cabin was very old, with roof caved in, and door and window
  vacant&mdash;like black eyes. The corral fence was down in places. Rock
  thought he remembered having once visited this deserted homesteader&rsquo;s
  ranch.</p>

  <p>One of the cowboys, a tall fellow wearing a red scarf, turned some of the
  cowhides over to look at the under side. Presently he and the others on foot
  collected in a group round their mounted comrades, and talked. What would
  Rock not have given to have heard them! For there might have been nothing
  unusual about this, and on the other hand it might have been a serious
  colloquy. Watching like a hawk, Rock convinced himself that these riders were
  curious about Preston&rsquo;s butchering business. Nothing inimical to the
  Prestons manifested itself. A riding outfit might drop down anywhere. On that
  hundred square miles of open range there were many thousand head of cattle
  under different brands, and therefore a number of cowboys under different
  management. Judging by the past, these outfits were not likely to be
  particularly friendly toward one another. They all looked upon one another
  with suspicion. That was simply the life of the range.</p>

  <p>Rock strained his eyes to take in all details of that red-scarfed
  rider&rsquo;s appearance, so he might recognize him some day. But the
  distance was pretty far, even for his sharp eyes, and he could not be sure.
  Presently the mounted riders galloped off, and those on foot took to their
  horses and followed. They rode up the ridge, westward from the cabin. The
  fellow with the red scarf, following last, halted on the brink of that pocket
  and took final survey of the scene. Was there something on his mind? Finally
  he rolled a cigarette. Rock saw a puff of bluish smoke. Then the rider
  followed after his comrades, who had disappeared over the ridge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&rdquo; muttered Rock, rolling out of his uncomfortable
  covert and wiping his perspiring face. &ldquo;What to make of that? Maybe
  means nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo; then again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He counted the cowhides in sight. Thirteen! It was not a lucky number. But
  there might be several more hides on the far side of the log cabin. Even so,
  that was rather a small number, if the hides in sight represented all the
  beeves killed by Preston on this occasion. Preston had gone to town with
  three large wagons, one of which Rock had helped load with hides. The other
  two, of course, had been loaded with beeves. How many? That was something
  Rock wanted to know&mdash;and meant to find out.</p>

  <p>He resisted the impulse to go down into that draw. This could wait until a
  more favorable hour. Instead, he retraced his way to his horse, racking his
  brain the while.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, hell!&rdquo; blurted out Rock, in disgust. &ldquo;If it was
  anyone but Thiry&rsquo;s people I&rsquo;d <i>know</i>. I do know, only I keep
  hopin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No doubt at all was there that the cowhides in plain sight over in the
  draw bore one of several of Preston&rsquo;s brands. If other stock besides
  Preston&rsquo;s had been butchered, which Rock did not doubt in the least,
  the hides with their telltale brands had of course been well hidden. Heads
  were easier to dispose of, and the risk of discovery through them was
  negligible. Three or four riders, taking as many heads, and riding out at
  night into rough places, could throw a good many into holes and brush, where
  not one in a hundred would ever come to light. And small matter if they did!
  What was the head of a steer on that vast cattle range? Hides, however, were
  branded to protect the owners. But if hides ripped from stolen beeves were
  carefully hidden, as Rock believed was true in the matter of Slagle&rsquo;s
  well, the chances were very few that the theft could ever be detected.
  Preston was safe for the time being if he relied on Slagle&rsquo;s well to
  conceal his thefts. For Rock could never betray him. The best that Rock felt
  he might do&mdash;in case he proved his suspicions&mdash;was to tell Preston
  and scare him from any further crooked work. The nucleus of that, indeed, was
  forming in Rock&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <p>Straddling Egypt once more, Rock rode down the hill toward Wagontongue.
  Should he go on into town or only so far as Pringle&rsquo;s? It struck him
  that he might be in a little too brooding a state of mind to stop over with
  his homesteader friend. He might ask too many questions.</p>

  <p>Cedars and brush grew densely at the foot of this slope, where the road
  crossed a culvert over a deep wash. Rock&rsquo;s eyes, bent on the ground,
  suddenly espied the heel imprint of a rider&rsquo;s boot. It stopped Rock. If
  he ever had occasion to study a track of any kind it became photographed on
  his mind. He had seen that heel track before. Slipping out of the saddle,
  Rock bent to scrutinize it. And he experienced a queer little cold chill.</p>

  <p>The impression of the heel was well defined, but the toe part was dim. It
  pointed off the road. Rock found another, like it, though not so plain. But
  for his trained eyes the trail might as well have been made in snow. Whoever
  had made it, though, had stepped lightly. It led into the coarse white grass,
  down over the bank, to the edge of the culvert, where it vanished.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt in Rock&rsquo;s mind that this imprint was identical
  with the one near Slagle&rsquo;s well. He had the little sticks with which he
  had measured that track. Taking them out, Rock was about to go back and
  measure, when his instinct prompted him to take a look at the culvert, now
  that he was down there. He walked on, stepping on stones.</p>

  <p>The culvert was not the handiwork of masons. The aperture was large, to
  take care of a considerable flow of water during the wet season. Crude walls
  of heavy stone had been laid about ten feet high and the same distance apart.
  Logs and brush had been placed across the top. Above this a heavy layer of
  earth formed the road.</p>

  <p>When Rock stepped into the mouth of the culvert he saw a lumpy floor,
  which at first glance he thought consisted of rocks lying on dried mud.</p>

  <p>A foot track, the one he was trailing, brought a low exclamation from his
  lips. Bending quickly, with his little sticks he tried them. They fitted
  perfectly. Moreover, this one had been made recently.</p>

  <p>When Rock rose from that track he knew what he was going to find. The
  tunnel appeared about a hundred feet long, with light shining in at both
  ends, and the middle dark. The numerous stones on the floor were of uniform
  size and shape, and he noted that the first of these lay back several yards
  from the opening of the culvert.</p>

  <p>Rock kicked one. It was soft. Bending to feel of it and to look at it more
  closely, he ascertained that it was a burlap sack tied round something. He
  laughed sardonically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowhide,&rdquo; he said, and went on, kicking to right and left.
  These stone-like objects were all hides tied up in burlap sacks. They were
  old. Some of them were rotting. Then toward the middle of the culvert, where
  the bags were thickest, he found that those in sight were lying on a bed of
  bags, flat, decomposed. Altogether, hundreds, perhaps thousands of hides had
  been destroyed there. He detected a dry, musty odor, but it was not
  strong.</p>

  <p>Rock went back to the point where he had found the boot track. It was
  useless to attempt to conceal his own trail. He reflected that in a few days
  now the rains would come, and with water running through the culvert all
  traces of his having been there would be obliterated.</p>

  <p>If fresh cowhides had lately been deposited in this hiding-place where
  were they? Rock searched the ground more carefully. Back from the opening it
  was difficult to see well. Nevertheless, he trailed the heel track a third of
  the length of the culvert, toward its center.</p>

  <p>Naturally then he reached up to feel where he could not see. He had to put
  his toes in crevices between the stones to climb up and reach over the top of
  the wall. The thick logs placed across from wall to wall, and far apart, left
  considerable room along the top.</p>

  <p>When Rock&rsquo;s groping hand came in contact with a sack he felt no
  surprise. This one was not soft. It appeared to hold heat. Grasping it
  firmly, Rock dropped to the ground and hurried with it to the light. He
  ripped it open. Quicklime, hot and moist! A fresh cowhide, wrapped with hair
  inside!</p>

  <p>With hands that actually shook Rock unfolded the hide. No slight thing was
  this proof of somebody&rsquo;s guilt&mdash;about to be disclosed! The brand
  was clear&mdash;a half moon. Rock had never heard of it. He certainly knew
  all the old brands of that range.</p>

  <p>He rolled up the hide, stuffed it in the sack, with the little quicklime
  he had spilled. And he put it back where he had found it. Then he struck a
  match. By the dim light he saw rows of burlap sacks, neatly stowed away.</p>

  <p>Rock sneaked out of that culvert and into the cedars and round and up to
  his horse as if indeed he were the guilty one himself. Not until he was
  riding away down the road, positive that he had been unseen, did he recover
  his equanimity. To ferret out rustler tricks, trail stolen cattle and horses,
  and discover evidence of thieving practices on the range, had been part of
  Rock&rsquo;s long experience. It was all in the day&rsquo;s work. How vastly
  another thing here! That boot track had been made by Ash Preston. Rock knew
  it. Gage Preston was growing rich by butchering other ranchers&rsquo; cattle.
  The very least implication Rock accorded to Thiry Preston was that she shared
  the secret, and therefore indirectly the guilt. And Rock loved
  her&mdash;loved her terribly now, in view of her extremity. When he got to
  that confession he seemed unable to escape from the tumult and terror it
  roused in his mind.</p>

  <p>Egypt, left to choose his gait, had started off on his fast trot. He had
  many gaits, but this was his favorite, and it covered distance rapidly. He
  held to it steadily, except on the hills, when he slowed to a walk.</p>

  <p>Rock scarcely saw the beautiful rangeland. He rode past Pringle&rsquo;s
  place before noon, scarcely aware of it. He was in no mood for friends. But
  in due time his emotion spent itself upon the resolve to save Thiry if he had
  to die to do it.</p>

  <p>After that he gradually rounded to a coherent, if not a logically
  connected, sequence of thoughts. When cattle disappeared off the range, any
  range, in more than a negligible number, it always led, sooner or later, to
  speculation and private suspicion by every outfit, and usually investigation,
  also private, by the outfit that had suffered most. Rock recalled cases where
  quite extensive rustling had never been cleared up. Ranchers worked slowly in
  this regard. They might step on some one&rsquo;s toes. Generally when the
  perpetrators of crooked work were unearthed, it was accomplished by the
  cowboys rather than the ranchers.</p>

  <p>Rock had no idea how far this extraordinary dealing of the Prestons had
  gone. It would take considerable time to find that out, if it were possible
  at all. But it had proceeded far enough to be extremely hazardous for them,
  and in fact for any riders connected with them. The situation would certainly
  become a delicate one for Rock, unless he betrayed Preston at once. This was
  unthinkable. Rock knew his own reputation had always been above reproach, as
  far as honesty was concerned. It would still hold good with the old cattlemen
  who knew him. But that could scarcely apply to new ranchers, new outfits, who
  had come into the Wagontongue range of late years.</p>

  <p>Rock believed that before another year was out, if the Prestons kept up
  this amazing and foolhardy stealing, they would be found out. Why could not
  Preston see this? He certainly did not lack intelligence. One remark he had
  made to Thiry had been thought-provoking. It might well be true that Ash
  Preston, having led or forced his father into criminal practice, dominated
  him wholly. Ash Preston struck Rock as a man without fear or conscience, and
  even without a heart, except where Thiry was concerned.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s mind rejected solutions to this problem as fast as it created
  them. There was not any solution, at least at this hour of the game. Rock
  must know more, and if possible everything, before he could formulate any
  plan to stop Preston and save Thiry. If there were other suspecting riders,
  besides Rock, on the range, that fact could not be helped. Any moment one of
  them might stumble upon signs which would lead to discovery and exposure.
  Still, the possibility was remote. Slagle&rsquo;s well was known to none save
  old riders of the range, and they, no doubt, were gone. Then who would ever
  look under an innocent and open culvert along the road? No doubt in the world
  that there were other places as cunning! Rock did not want to find any more.
  Whenever he came to a bridged wash, he wondered if it, too, harbored sacks
  and hides, but he did not get off to investigate. The last and only proof he
  required was to see one of Ash Preston&rsquo;s boot tracks. That would prove
  what Rock was already sure of. Afterward he would wait until events shaped
  themselves to decide his future actions.</p>

  <p>As the hours passed, Rock reviewed the whole knotty question again,
  without further enlightenment. He strove to bring reason and intelligence to
  bear, instead of a mounting antipathy for Ash Preston.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon Rock encountered the first rain of the summer. It
  was only a shower, in the locality through which he rode, and while the
  glistening drops pattered down the sun continued to shine behind him. To the
  east, over the desert, a low far-spreading vivid rainbow stood out against a
  background of purple cloud. The odor of dust permeated the air, and the
  glistening sagebrush seemed conscious of refreshment. There appeared to be
  heavy rain off to the eastward. Rock felt the cool drops soak through the
  sleeves of his shirt. He took off his sombrero and let them wet his hair and
  splash his hot face. But soon the shower passed on.</p>

  <p>It was long past dark when Rock arrived at Wagontongue. Upon inquiring of
  a Mexican, he found a stable where Egypt would be well looked after. Next he
  hunted up a restaurant to appease his own hunger, and then he went to the
  hotel and to bed. The long ride and the long hours of emotional and mental
  conflict had exhausted him. Not for years had he been so sunk in gloom. The
  urge to drink came upon him, and he laughed it away. He had need of
  stimulant, yes, but not that false kind. It was well that he fell asleep at
  once.</p>

  <p>The sawmill whistle disrupted his deep slumber at six o&rsquo;clock, but
  he enjoyed the luxury of the soft bed and linen sheets awhile before rising.
  Rested and fresh again, and with the bright gold sunrise shining in his
  window, Rock felt far removed from the brooding, fagged rider of the night
  before. He would find a way. He dared to pit himself against Ash Preston in
  anything. Least of all did he consider Ash particularly dangerous to face in
  fair gun-play. He was several years younger than Rock, and had been only five
  on the range. Calculating on that, and his own long experience, his instinct
  for divining an opponent&rsquo;s intent, and his swift hand, Rock felt a
  certainty of his power to beat Ash Preston to a gun and kill him. That
  question, not before deliberately thought out and faced, seemed settled.
  Indeed, it had arisen involuntarily, presupposing that Rock&rsquo;s
  subconscious mind had accepted the meeting as inevitable and had dealt with
  it. Rock resisted this strange thing, repudiated any certainty of conflict,
  and swore he would avoid that, but all the same the possible issue had been
  met in his consciousness, and without his consent had been decided upon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cheerful way to begin the day,&rdquo; thought Rock, yawning and
  stretching. &ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;ve got to do a lot of things. And sure I
  mustn&rsquo;t forget that masquerade rig.... But I&rsquo;m not
  goin&rsquo;.... I sure oughtn&rsquo;t to.... Would it be very risky&mdash;if
  I went for a little while&mdash;and kept disguised?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After breakfast, which Rock partook of rather late, he went round to see
  Sol Winter. And meanwhile he had subdued himself to some semblance of the old
  order of cool insouciance, which state really had been natural before the
  fair face of Thiry Preston had disturbed his equilibrium forever.</p>

  <p>Winter was sweeping out the store, his back to the door, and he did not
  see or hear Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; said Rock, in harsh disguised voice, as he gave
  Winter a hard dig in the back with his forefinger, to imitate the prod of a
  gun. &ldquo;Money or your life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated Winter, swiftly dropping the broom and
  elevating his hands high. He had once been held up by a robber.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; ordered Rock.</p>

  <p>Stiff as a poker the storekeeper obeyed, white and tight of face. Suddenly
  he became transformed most ludicrously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock!... You&mdash;dod-blasted&mdash;son of a sea-cook!&rdquo; he
  gasped out, dropping his hands, the right of which he extended shakily to
  meet Rock&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Scared me&mdash;most to death!&mdash;Same old
  cowboy! My, you look good! All browned-up.... Dog-gone, I&rsquo;m glad to see
  you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Same here, old-timer,&rdquo; replied Rock, heartily. &ldquo;Reckon
  you look a little brighter, Sol.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve less worry, son, an&rsquo; at my age worry tells. Fact
  is, I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; fine again. Since payin&rsquo; my debts, I&rsquo;ve
  laid in more stock an&rsquo; advertised it. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to make
  money, pardner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;m sure tickled. Reckon I&rsquo;ll need a pile one of
  these days.... Any news, Sol?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much. Everybody comin&rsquo; in for the Fourth. Amy
  Dabb&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; the biggest dance ever held in these parts.
  Masquerade. Won&rsquo;t that be a new one on the punchers? You ain&rsquo;t
  goin&rsquo; to miss it, True?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might drop in to look on a minute,&rdquo; returned Rock,
  casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you get an invite?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Amy sent me one by Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Winter, with anticipated
  pleasure. &ldquo;Sent me word she an&rsquo; Alice would stay two nights with
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonder what she&rsquo;ll wear&mdash;and if I can recognize
  her?&rdquo; mused Rock, with shining eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a hundred
  I&rsquo;ll know her pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, True, you don&rsquo;t look much like a disconsolate
  lover.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? By gosh! I am, all the same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! Wal, that&rsquo;s new for you. How&rsquo;re things generally
  out Sunset Pass way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty bad, Sol. But there&rsquo;s too much of it to tell
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bet you had a run-in with Ash!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. Outside of stealin&rsquo; my horse, Ash acted tolerable nice,
  for <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stole your horse!&mdash;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s alive yet?&rdquo;
  ejaculated Winter, his shrewd old eyes warm upon Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I took it as if I was complimented.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True Rock, you &rsquo;pear rational enough, an&rsquo; you shore
  ain&rsquo;t drunk,&rdquo; returned Winter, reflectively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honest, Sol. I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you truth. Now what do you
  say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, all I can say is love works wonders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does it? All right, old-timer. Let&rsquo;s hope it lasts.... But to
  leave off and talk serious, Sol. I want to find out
  somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Winter, as Rock led him back into the store.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston drove in here a couple of days ago,&rdquo; went on Rock,
  lowering his voice. &ldquo;In the outfit were three wagons I know of. One was
  full of hides, which I helped pack. The other two were loaded with meat.
  Beeves! Now I want to find out how many beeves there were and where they
  went. But I don&rsquo;t want this information unless we can get it absolutely
  without rousin&rsquo; the slightest curiosity or question. Savvy old
  pardner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll be darned if that ain&rsquo;t funny,&rdquo;
  ejaculated Winter, his eyes narrowing to mere slits.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Nothin&rsquo; funny about it, as I can show you,&rdquo; said
  Rock, bluntly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, mebbe I mean queer. For I shore can tell you right now what
  you&rsquo;re so damn keen about knowin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, with a quick breath, and he sat
  down heavily upon the counter. He had actually to nerve himself for the
  disclosure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heard it quite by accident,&rdquo; went on Winter. &ldquo;Jackson,
  who runs Dabb&rsquo;s butcher shop, once worked for me. An&rsquo; if I do say
  it myself he liked workin&rsquo; for me better than for Dabb. Wal, I went in
  last night to buy some beefsteak to take home. An&rsquo; I seen a lot of
  fresh meat hangin&rsquo; up. Shore I always was curious, but I never let on I
  was. All I said was: &lsquo;See you&rsquo;re stocked up plenty an&rsquo;
  fresh. How&rsquo;re you ever goin&rsquo; to sell all that meat before it
  spoils?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t last over the Fourth,&rsquo; he said.
  &lsquo;Long as I got plenty an&rsquo; can sell cheap to the Mexicans
  an&rsquo; lumbermen, it shore goes fast. Wagontongue will soon stand another
  butcher shop, Sol, an&rsquo; any time you want to talk business with me
  I&rsquo;m ready.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over, Jackson,&rsquo; I said.
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m out of debt an&rsquo; doin&rsquo; well again. But
  where&rsquo;ll we get the meat? Reckon we couldn&rsquo;t cut in on
  Dabb&rsquo;s supply?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, we can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he told me, &lsquo;but Preston is
  killin&rsquo; now altogether instead of sellin&rsquo; any more on the hoof.
  He&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; thirty dollars more by killin&rsquo;, on each head
  of stock. He&rsquo;ll sell to anybody. Today he shipped thirty-six beeves.
  Driscoll told me. Shipped them to Marigold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter paused to see what effect this news might have upon Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thirty-six!&rdquo; muttered Rock, with unreadable face and
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. An&rsquo; I counted ten beeves hangin&rsquo; up on
  Jackson&rsquo;s hooks. All fresh. So that makes forty-six. Now let me see.
  Forty-six times thirty.... Thirteen hundred an&rsquo; eighty dollars
  <i>more</i>. Hum! Not so poor, Rock.&mdash;What you want to know all this
  for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee, Sol, you&rsquo;re a gabby old lady!&rdquo; returned Rock.
  &ldquo;I was just askin&rsquo;, because you and I might go into the meat
  business.... And say, who runs the Half Moon brand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;New cattleman named Hesbitt,&rdquo; replied Winter.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been on the range over two years. I&rsquo;ve seen him, but
  don&rsquo;t know him. They say he hails from Wyomin&rsquo;, has got lots of
  money, an&rsquo; runs a hard outfit. Clink Peeples is foreman. You ought to
  know him, Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clink Peeples. By gum! that sounds familiar. I&rsquo;ve heard his
  name, anyway. What does he look like, Sol?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Onusual tall puncher. Sandy complected. Eyes sharp like a
  hawk&rsquo;s, but tawny. Light tawny. Somethin&rsquo; of a dandy, leastways
  in town. Always wears a red scarf. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s one of the
  gun-packin&rsquo; fraternity. Clink will be in town shore over the
  Fourth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Red scarf? Ahum!&rdquo; said Rock, dropping his head. &ldquo;Clink?
  Where does he get that name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, somebody said he had a habit of clinkin&rsquo; gold coins at
  the bar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds like the range,&rdquo; laughed Rock. &ldquo;They sure can
  call a puncher proper.... Well, Sol, I&rsquo;ll run along, and drop in
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did run along, as if hurrying to get away from some one; but it was
  only from himself and his coalescing thoughts. Pretty soon some one was
  likely to come up to him with one of Ash Preston&rsquo;s boots! Rock wondered
  if he were lucky or unlucky. He concluded it was the latter, for wherever he
  roamed, unfortunate persons and untoward events centered around him.</p>

  <p>Reaching Dabb&rsquo;s new store, where the windows were full of
  merchandise of all sorts, Rock went in and hunted up the suit department. It
  chanced that there was in stock a black broadcloth suit, with frock coat,
  which might have been made for him, so well did it fit. Rock purchased it and
  an embroidered vest of fancy design, a white shirt with ruffles in the bosom,
  a wide white collar and a black flowing bow-tie to go with it. Lastly he
  bought shiny leather shoes, rather light and soft, which augured well for
  dancing. Not forgetting a mask, he asked for a plain black one. None of any
  kind was available. All false faces and masks of humorous design had been
  sold.</p>

  <p>Rock carried his possessions back to the hotel, certain that some of his
  youthful cowboy sensations were not wholly dead. While in his room he cut a
  pattern of a mask out of paper, and taking this back to the store he bought a
  piece of black cloth and fashioned it after the pattern he had cut.</p>

  <p>Then to kill time and to forget the burden on his mind, Rock went about
  renewing old acquaintances, whom he found in greater numbers than he had
  anticipated. But he shied away from the saloons; not that he distrusted his
  strength, but because he believed he had parted company with that atmosphere
  for good and all. He met cowboys on the street corners and stopped to chat;
  he met ranchers in the post-office and in the county clerk&rsquo;s hall,
  where he went to investigate cattle brands.</p>

  <p>What with a late dinner and another visit at Sol Winter&rsquo;s store, a
  call at the stable to see Egypt, and then more leisurely random saunterings
  around town, the day passed by. After supper the hotel man, Clark, got hold
  of him and in a genial way whose intent was obvious to Rock, tried to pump
  him about the Prestons. Rock had met that same attitude before during the
  day, and though without apparent evasion, he did not commit himself. Then who
  but Jem Slagle stamped into the hotel lobby, in his rough range garb.</p>

  <p>Slagle had been trifling with the bottle, but he was not by any means
  drunk. He was, however, under the influence of rum, and his happened to be a
  disposition aversely affected by it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, thar, Sunset Pass puncher!&rdquo; he said, loud and
  leering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Jem! How are you? I called on the way in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Left home yesterday. Stayin&rsquo; till after the fireworks. Are
  you goin&rsquo; back to Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, certainly! Like my new job fine,&rdquo; responded Rock.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of a foreman over the younger Prestons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, it was a hell of a good bet that Gage Preston would never put
  <i>you</i> to butcherin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you say. Well, I reckon &rsquo;most any rancher could figure
  I&rsquo;d never go in for that kind of work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho! Ho!&mdash;Preston was figgerin&rsquo; deeper&rsquo;n that,
  Rock,&rdquo; returned Slagle, with evil eye. &ldquo;Wanta drink with
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I&rsquo;ve sworn off,&rdquo; replied Rock, shortly, and
  he went out to walk in the darkness. Slagle&rsquo;s remarks did not set
  lightly upon Rock. They were trenchant with meaning. Slagle, of course, hated
  Preston, and naturally would be prone to cast slurs. But would he make
  two-sided remarks like that, just out of rancor? It would go severely with
  him if one of them ever came to Preston&rsquo;s ears. And rattlesnake Ash
  Preston would strike at less than that.</p>

  <p>The night air bore the cool freshness of past rain, and the scents of a
  desert moistened and revivified.</p>

  <p>Rock strolled to and fro, between the hotel lights and those on the
  corner. When would the Prestons arrive in Wagontongue? The boys would ride it
  through in one day, except perhaps one or two of them who would accompany the
  womenfolk. They would require a day and a half to make the journey, possibly
  a little less. Rock, yielding to musings not wholly free from pain, dared to
  dwell on a possible dance with Thiry. But that was too wonderful to come
  true, at least now. He would not be so weak and selfish as to jeopardize her
  evening&rsquo;s pleasure, by asking. Still, he wanted to see her at that
  dance, if only from some obscure corner behind the crowd.</p>

  <p>As he came again into the yellow flare of light, quick pattering footsteps
  sounded behind him, and soon the swish of skirts. A hand, small, eager, and
  strong, seized his arm, and a feminine voice he knew rang under his ear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True Rock, I&rsquo;ve been on your trail all afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">ROCK stared down into the piquant flushed face of his old
  sweetheart, Amy Wund.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you and I&rsquo;m going to hang on to
  you,&rdquo; she said, with a roguishness that did not altogether conceal a
  firm determination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;how do&mdash;Mrs. Dabb? You sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Dabb, h&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; she interrupted, flashing
  dark passionate eyes up at him. &ldquo;Call me Amy, can&rsquo;t you?
  What&rsquo;s the sense of being so formal? You used to call me &lsquo;darling
  Amy&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no gainsaying that. And he did not admire profanity from a
  woman&rsquo;s lips, no matter how pretty they were. Amy&rsquo;s checked him
  up to reasonableness sooner than could have any proper speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-evenin&rsquo;, Amy,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  forgotten what I used to call you. Reckon it&rsquo;s not just good taste for
  you to remind me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, True. But you make me furious. I could do
  anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure you could. But, for instance, do you think it wise to hang on
  to me&mdash;this way&mdash;right in front of the hotel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of the light, then. I&rsquo;ve got to talk to
  you,&rdquo; she replied, and pressing his arm tight she hurried him down the
  dark street.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, listen to sense. Oughtn&rsquo;t you be home?&rdquo; asked
  Rock, gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sense from True Rock? Ye Gods! When I was sixteen you <i>made</i>
  me meet you out, at night, because my father wouldn&rsquo;t let you come to
  our house,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Amy. I guess I was no good. But I&rsquo;ve learned
  a little in all these years&mdash;at least enough to consider a woman&rsquo;s
  name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I believe you have. And it&rsquo;s not true you were no
  good.... Now about my being at home. I suppose I ought to be there, since I
  took the responsibility of it. But it&rsquo;s an empty home, Trueman. I am
  alone most of the time. John has men come there to drink and play cards and
  talk business. He objects to my friends. He is as jealous as the devil. Just
  a selfish rich old man! I have money, horses. I think children would have
  made it a home, but there are none&mdash;and never will be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, too bad, Amy,&rdquo; replied Rock, deeply touched. &ldquo;You
  never should have married Dabb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father was in debt to John.... And I had to foot that bill,
  True,&rdquo; she returned, bitterly. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t waylay you to
  talk about myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know I was in town?&rdquo; asked Rock, glad to have
  the subject changed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard it this morning. And I sure was thrilled. True, did you get
  the invitation to my dance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did. Many thanks, Amy. It was good of you. I rather expected to
  be left out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you have been hurt if you had?&rdquo; she asked,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I would. Men are such queer hombres.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you coming, True?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s a horse of another color,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like to. I might drop in for a little&mdash;to look
  on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True Rock! You look on at a dance! Why, cowboy, are you growing
  old?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Amy, I feel far from being old. But there are reasons. You
  should know one of them, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean my husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure do. He never had any use for me after I quit him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the same, Trueman. I could get him to hire you as foreman of
  the whole outfit. And that&rsquo;s a job. John is running thirty thousand
  head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You could not,&rdquo; returned Rock, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want the job?&rdquo; she retorted, with uplift of chin he
  remembered well.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Amy, no. I&rsquo;ve got one job. Thank you all the
  same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, that Preston job is a poor-paying one and a risky
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that, Amy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard John say so. But let&rsquo;s get this dance question
  settled. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They halted at the end of the sidewalk, on the outskirts of town. The
  stars were shining brightly, and by their light Rock saw Amy&rsquo;s face,
  upturned to his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, you make me angry,&rdquo; said Rock, though he was not so sure
  of that. &ldquo;Here you are&mdash;an old sweetheart of mine, and now married
  to a man who hates me&mdash;coaxing me to come to a dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, Trueman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I sure better not come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that was partly a lie,&rdquo; she cried, in disgust at herself.
  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even tell the truth any more. I&rsquo;d like you to come
  for several reasons, Trueman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, fire away,&rdquo; he said, lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First for old times&rsquo; sake. Then because certain of my friends
  say you won&rsquo;t come. Next because&mdash;well, True, I&rsquo;ve been a
  darned fool. I&rsquo;ve gone&mdash;a&mdash;a little too far with a certain
  cowboy. And I&rsquo;m afraid of him. He&rsquo;s coming to my dance. And I
  thought&mdash;if you were there&mdash;I&rsquo;d not be afraid,
  anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A certain cowboy. Why certain, Amy?&rdquo; he inquired, looking
  dubiously at her, aware she could not meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I might as well make a clean breast of it,&rdquo; she
  said, almost with defiance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d met this fellow often. Oh, I
  liked him, I guess. But I wasn&rsquo;t crazy about him, and I never
  encouraged him until that day you snubbed me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what did you do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I flirted&mdash;oh, worse than ever,&rdquo; she replied, and she
  had the courage to look shamefacedly up at Rock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him
  twice since. And the last time&mdash;I&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, how far did you go?&rdquo; broke in Rock, as she paused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too far!... I let him kiss me&mdash;hug me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy Wund!&rdquo; exclaimed Trueman. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have
  amounted to much before, but now I&rsquo;m ashamed of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Trueman, I came to my senses,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t want to see him again. But he&rsquo;ll come to the dance.... And
  they tell me he&rsquo;s a pretty wild cowboy. At that he&rsquo;s no boy,
  I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is he, Amy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his real first name. His last is Peeples. Clink,
  they call him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clink Peeples. I&rsquo;ve sure heard of him. Rides for this new
  rancher, Hesbitt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And Hesbitt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One thing at a time, Amy. Is this the last reason you have for
  wanting me at that dance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Trueman, there&rsquo;s another. A woman&rsquo;s reason, and
  therefore the most important.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, I reckon your third reason is enough to fetch me.
  I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Trueman,&rdquo; she replied, in delight, squeezing
  his hand. &ldquo;You always were the dearest, kindest fellow when anyone was
  in trouble.... Trueman, you could steady me. God knows I need it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, I don&rsquo;t exactly trust you,&rdquo; said Rock, dubiously.
  &ldquo;I never did. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I haven&rsquo;t faith in you
  at all. You&rsquo;ve got it in you to become a splendid woman. Could I help
  you&mdash;as a friend or brother? Be honest, Amy, I&rsquo;d despise you if
  you lied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you could, and I&rsquo;ll be grateful for that&mdash;if I
  can&rsquo;t have more,&rdquo; she rejoined, won to sincerity by his
  force.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Shake hands on it,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, smiling
  down on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, True, I won&rsquo;t promise not to try to&mdash;to make you be
  more,&rdquo; she said, rebelliously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; he returned, sharply. &ldquo;Amy,
  will you consent to my callin&rsquo; on your husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want to see John?&rdquo; she queried, astounded, her eyes
  opening wide. &ldquo;What on earth for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I think it might be a good idea,&rdquo; he rejoined,
  evasively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might, at that,&rdquo; she agreed, her dark eyes full of
  thought. Then she tossed her head and laughed. &ldquo;All right, go ahead.
  You have my consent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re game, Amy. No one could say not.... Can I ask John
  anythin&rsquo; I like and tell him what I want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock, you son-of-a-gun!&rdquo; she burst out, as if
  astonished into a corner. &ldquo;Yes, darn you, anything except I was once in
  love with you&mdash;and that it&rsquo;s not utterly impossible for me to be
  so foolish again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take good care you don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he
  laughed, wondering why he had been so unkind. She was amenable, and perhaps
  not so dangerous as he had imagined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I have something more to say,&rdquo; she said,
  hesitatingly, lacking her former confidence and spirit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well then, say it. A woman always leaves the worst for the
  last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better quit riding for the Prestons,&rdquo; she
  answered, her reluctance giving place to intense earnestness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he inquired, freezing a little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t explain what may be only my
  intuition. But I give you my word of honor, Trueman, that it&rsquo;s not
  because I&mdash;I might be jealous of Thiry Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To do her justice, Rock had to admit to himself that the deceitful side of
  her seemed to be in abeyance at this moment. She was grave. Her eyes were big
  with perplexity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? What is it, then?&rdquo; he asked, tensely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe the Prestons are going to get more than the ill will of
  the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strong statement, Amy. On what do you base
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, I can&rsquo;t trace it down. But it must come from many
  little bits of gossip I&rsquo;ve heard. Some of it, by the way, from Peeples.
  Everyone knows, of course, that you took the job to be near Thiry Preston.
  It&rsquo;s a joke already. That&rsquo;s your side of it. Trueman, you have a
  reputation. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean as a gun-slinger. That&rsquo;s old. Nor do
  I mean as a great rider, roper, and all such cowboy qualities. It&rsquo;s
  that you&rsquo;re true blue, honest, a man of your word. Why even my husband
  thinks that. For I asked him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Amy. I hope I deserve it. I certainly mean
  to....But is there unusual interest in me, just now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point. There is, True. I could tell you a lot of
  things, if I could remember. One is&mdash;Clink Peeples said he reckoned Gage
  Preston would profit by your honest name. Isn&rsquo;t that a queer remark,
  Trueman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;a little,&rdquo; Rock admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s another&mdash;more of a stumper,&rdquo; went on
  Amy. &ldquo;Last night John had some men out to the house, as usual. They
  talked and smoked. When I heard your name I listened. Some one, I think it
  was Mr. Hesbitt, answered whoever had used your name first. &lsquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know this great cowboy Rock,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But if he
  stays on ridin&rsquo; for Preston, I&rsquo;ll not share the opinion you men
  have of him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, that isn&rsquo;t a compliment to Preston,&rdquo; said Rock,
  ponderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It certainly isn&rsquo;t. And it means you&rsquo;ll lose your
  reputation. Trueman, there&rsquo;s something wrong about this Preston outfit.
  I can feel what I can&rsquo;t explain. You know I&rsquo;m not a fool about
  everything. I was born here. My dad has been a cattleman all his life.
  He&rsquo;s away now, in Colorado. I wish he&rsquo;d hurry back. I could get
  things out of him. John is close-mouthed, as most of these cattlemen
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all good reason to be,&rdquo; said Rock, laughingly.
  &ldquo;They were cowboys once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, you don&rsquo;t need to tell me that. And don&rsquo;t beat
  around the bush or make light of it. I&rsquo;m thinking of your good name.
  There&rsquo;s an undercurrent of feeling here and there&mdash;against the
  Prestons. It&rsquo;ll spread, if there&rsquo;s any reason for it. And then
  you&rsquo;d be dragged in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, I hope it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; more than gossip,&rdquo;
  returned Rock, slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, will you leave Preston? Please, you can get three times the
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll stick, Amy. I should think you&rsquo;d know that. If
  there&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo; in these hints I reckon the Prestons need me all
  the more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I always loved you for that very trait,&rdquo; she said, with
  passion. &ldquo;But I wish here you didn&rsquo;t have it.... Oh, Trueman, I
  tell you I dread this job of yours. That wild, beautiful Sunset Pass! That
  lovely, strange Thiry Preston! She&rsquo;ll fall in love with you. How could
  she help it? And you&rsquo;ll be dragged in with them. You&rsquo;ll have to
  kill this Ash Preston. Oh, he&rsquo;s a snake! He insulted me vilely, right
  on the street. There&rsquo;s not room enough on this range for you and him.
  You&rsquo;ll fight. I feel it, Trueman. A woman knows.... Oh, it took years
  for me to get over your killing Hooker!... Don&rsquo;t hush me. I <i>will</i>
  tell you.... That poor cowboy, crazed by drink and jealousy! How he hounded
  you&mdash;and finally shot you&mdash;so you had to kill him to save your own
  life.... Trueman. I <i>don&rsquo;t want</i> you to kill another
  man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a bloodthirsty devil?&rdquo; burst out Rock,
  repelled, yet sorry for her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to kill another man. I
  won&rsquo;t, if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She wiped her eyes. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said, more composed.
  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak out like that. I know how you hate
  it....Let us walk back now. You can drop me at my corner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not speak again for several blocks. She held his arm closely. Rock
  did not have anything to say. The interview had surprised, annoyed,
  frightened, and softened him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d care to see John tonight?&rdquo;
  she inquired, releasing his arm and stopping.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon not. Tomorrow, if I cheer up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&mdash;Trueman, I&rsquo;m sorry. I used
  to&mdash;&mdash;Well, never mind. But you won&rsquo;t drink? Remember my
  dance is only a day away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Amy, I won&rsquo;t drink&mdash;before or after your
  dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, I like you better than I used to,&rdquo; she said,
  softly.</p>

  <p>He bowed his thanks, not quite gallantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fact is, I never <i>liked</i> you,&rdquo; she retorted, quick to
  respond. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not fight again. Still, making up used to be
  such fun.... Trueman, what will you wear at my masquerade?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, little lady, that&rsquo;s not fair. I won&rsquo;t tell
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must. I&rsquo;ll never be able to recognize you. I remember how
  clever you used to be.... The unmasking will not take place until dinner.
  That&rsquo;ll be late, Trueman. And I&rsquo;ll want to know you, so in case I
  need you.... You may have to throw Clink Peeples out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So the honor of protectin&rsquo; you falls to me,&rdquo; laughed
  Rock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind you&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo;. But I&rsquo;ll
  stifle my suspicions.... Amy, I&rsquo;ve bought a dandy broadcloth frock
  suit, black. Also a fancy vest, shirt with ruffles, flowin&rsquo; black tie
  and black mask. The clerk in the store didn&rsquo;t know me from Adam, so he
  can&rsquo;t give me away. I&rsquo;ll come as a flash gambler.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look grand. Bet you make more than <i>one</i> heart
  ache,&rdquo; she returned, with a glance of mischief and regret. Then she
  extended her hand. &ldquo;Good night, Trueman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Next morning about eleven o&rsquo;clock, Rock strolled out of the hotel on
  his way to see John Dabb.</p>

  <p>He felt more like himself&mdash;his old self&mdash;than at any time since
  the cataclysm that had brought about his metamorphosis. How long, anyhow, had
  it been since he met Thiry Preston? Ages it seemed! Likewise his arrival at
  Wagontongue yesterday seemed far away. From the hour of his meeting Amy Dabb
  to the present moment, except for a half-night&rsquo;s sleep, events had
  multiplied. One after another of the persons whom he had conversed with,
  during that interval, had added with some obscure or casual remark, to the
  chain of calamity which was being forged around him.</p>

  <p>Trouble, menace, always brought out in Rock the reckless, dauntless spirit
  which he shared in common with his type. Drink, in the past, had made him
  more reckless, but less dangerous. As there was to be no more drink for him
  there was no hope for the oblivion cowboys yearned for on occasions. Rock had
  to face the music. And by this hour he had waxed stern and calculating, sure
  of his vision, while outwardly he appeared the old cool cowboy of the
  range.</p>

  <p>Rock asked to see John Dabb, and was shown into that individual&rsquo;s
  private office. He walked into a richly furnished room, where two men sat
  smoking. One was John Dabb, not a great deal changed from the Westerner Rock
  had once worked for. He was a well-preserved man of fifty, scarcely gray,
  with the lean face, strong chin, thin lips, and yellow-flecked hazel eyes
  Rock remembered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mr. Dabb!&rdquo; said Rock, easily. &ldquo;Reckon you know
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock!&rdquo; exclaimed Dabb, in great surprise. &ldquo;I
  do. Amy told me you were here.&rdquo; Embarrassment succeeded his
  astonishment, which was perhaps what caused him to extend his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hesbitt, this is True Rock, one of the real riders we used to
  have,&rdquo; went on Dabb, recovering to introduce his comrade, who had also
  arisen. &ldquo;Rock, shake hands with Hesbitt, one of our new
  ranchers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hesbitt bowed stiffly and spoke, without offering his hand. Rock looked
  squarely at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you, Mr. Hesbitt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His keen faculties, on edge now, gauged this man, unfavorably. Hesbitt was
  younger than Dabb, probably a man who had never been a cowboy, for he did not
  show the physical characteristics of the range. He was lean, sallow, hard,
  with sharp eyes close together and deep under bushy eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Rock, to what am I indebted for this call?&rdquo; queried
  Dabb, with curious coldness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remains to be seen whether you&rsquo;ll be indebted to me or not.
  Reckon that&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want your old job back?&rdquo; inquired the rancher,
  ironically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not now, but if I lose out with the Prestons, I&rsquo;d shore like
  my old place back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dabb was plainly puzzled and annoyed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, did you call to ask me that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, my business is a little more intimate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed? Ahem&mdash;er, I hope it&rsquo;s brief,&rdquo; rejoined
  Dabb, stiffening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As brief as you want it,&rdquo; returned Rock, and then he took a
  slow step nearer to Dabb&rsquo;s companion. &ldquo;Mr. Hesbitt, I heard this
  mornin&rsquo; that your foreman, Peeples, was in town, wantin&rsquo; to see
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he got in early, and I believe does want to look you
  up,&rdquo; said Hesbitt, deliberately, his deep-set eyes intent and
  unsatisfied upon Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon he can&rsquo;t be particular eager,&rdquo; drawled Rock.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up and down street, and in and out of the hotel all
  mornin&rsquo;&mdash;lookin&rsquo; for Mr. Peeples.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see.... I dare say he&rsquo;s very busy buyin&rsquo;
  supplies,&rdquo; replied Hesbitt, nervously. &ldquo;May I
  inquire&mdash;er&mdash;what you want of my foreman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; so important&mdash;that is, to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said
  Rock, with emphasis on the pronoun. &ldquo;I just wanted to give Peeples
  opportunity to meet me. And to tell him somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Hesbitt, whose sallow face slightly paled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;d sure like you to know as well. I just want to give
  you a hunch. Not till two days ago did I ever hear of the Half Moon brand.
  And not till yesterday did I learn what outfit run it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Manifestly Rock&rsquo;s cold biting speech impressed Hesbitt, but scarcely
  to the acceptance of its content. He knocked the ashes off his cigar, and
  picked up his hat from the desk, without deigning another glance at Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, your former cowboy&rsquo;s talk is queer, if true,&rdquo; he
  said, curtly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to renew old acquaintance. Good
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hesbitt, you&rsquo;re new to this range,&rdquo; rejoined Dabb, a
  little caustic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you before. And your Wyoming cowboy
  foreman needs to be told&mdash;or he&rsquo;ll get into trouble. This is not
  Wyoming.... I&rsquo;m bound to tell you that Rock&rsquo;s talk is not queer.
  I&rsquo;ll gamble it&rsquo;s true. I never knew him to lie. And no old rider
  or cattleman on this range would <i>say</i> it, even if he thought
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much obliged, Dabb,&rdquo; replied Hesbitt, heatedly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you something before&mdash;and it is that what this
  range needs is some new blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Some of it is most d&mdash;&mdash; liable to get
  spilled,&rdquo; said Dabb, harshly.</p>

  <p>Hesbitt bowed and went out, jarring the door. Dabb bit viciously at his
  cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of these new cowmen make me sick.... Rock, help yourself to a
  smoke and sit down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, I sure appreciate what you said to him about me,&rdquo;
  replied Rock, losing his coolness. &ldquo;Fact is I&rsquo;m surprised, too.
  I&rsquo;d been told you had no use for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, that&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; returned Dabb, quickly.
  &ldquo;When I knew you were honest, I was bound to say so. Your connection
  with Preston has started rumors. Hesbitt has been losing more stock than any
  of us. His outfit is a hard-nut bunch from Wyoming. They think
  you&rsquo;re&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want to repeat gossip. There&rsquo;s
  too much of it.... But whether or not I have any use for you I&rsquo;d sure
  need to see proof of your dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s straight talk. I like it and thank you. It makes what
  I wanted to say easier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;d forgot. You had some intimate business.... Make it
  short, Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, did I ever do you any dirt?&rdquo; queried Rock, by way of a
  start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You quit me, left me in the lurch,&rdquo; replied Dabb, testily.
  &ldquo;I never overlook that in a foreman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But be fair, at least,&rdquo; responded Rock, earnestly. &ldquo;I
  had to leave quick&mdash;or kill another man, and one very generally liked
  here, Cass Seward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may have thought so. Cass was a friend of mine. He told me once
  you didn&rsquo;t need to run off. He could have fixed it up. Arrested
  you&mdash;and let you off. It was an even break, you knew. What was that
  fellow&rsquo;s name? Anyway, I know everybody was glad you bumped him
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said
  Rock, broodingly. Then he shook off dark thoughts. &ldquo;Dabb, did you have
  anythin&rsquo; else against me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rancher thrummed on his desk, and puffed on his cigar, while revolving
  this query.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look me straight in the eye,&rdquo; went on Rock. &ldquo;Man to
  man, Dabb. If you have cards on me lay them down. I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;
  clean honest.... And a lot might depend on you doin&rsquo; the
  same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you driving at?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; very little, at least for two
  Westerners like us. I&rsquo;ve absolutely no ax to grind. I might want a job
  some day of you, but only on my merits. Now I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; only a
  show-down. I want to know where I stand with you. I want you to believe in my
  sincerity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, that&rsquo;s d&mdash;&mdash; strong talk&mdash;coming from
  you. It&rsquo;s hard for me to think you might have some underhand
  motive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think it. For there&rsquo;s none.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Rock, I&rsquo;ll meet you,&rdquo; replied Dabb, flushing
  darkly, evidently stirred. &ldquo;Straight out then, I&rsquo;ve sort of held
  against you&mdash;that old affair of yours and Amy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, cracking a fist in his palm.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I wanted you to admit. Dabb, it never amounted
  to shucks. You know what gossip is in this town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet I know,&rdquo; said Dabb, grimly. &ldquo;But even allowing
  for that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; interrupted Rock, leaning over to Dabb. &ldquo;The
  old women here gave Amy the worst of that affair. She was pretty and
  vain&mdash;and had a way with the boys. But she was good, and if they ever
  said otherwise they lied. I was in love with Amy, perhaps a little more so
  than I was with two other girls. Amy knew this. She never let herself go.
  I&rsquo;m sure she was fond of me, but there were other boys. And so we had
  it hot and heavy. But what I want to make clear to you, Dabb, is that Amy was
  never serious about me. I mean never in love as it was in her to be. And
  I&rsquo;m satisfied that she never has been yet. Even with you&mdash;her
  husband! You&rsquo;ll excuse me, Dabb, but this is blunt straight
  talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is, by God!&rdquo; Dabb said, strainedly. &ldquo;And to what
  end, Rock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy&rsquo;s happiness,&rdquo; flashed Rock. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  need to swear that, if you really know me, as you told Hesbitt.... I met Amy
  the day I arrived in Wagontongue and again yesterday. Dabb, she&rsquo;d scalp
  me alive if she ever found out I told you this.... She&rsquo;s lonesome and
  unhappy. I don&rsquo;t believe Amy ever would have married you if she
  hadn&rsquo;t cared somethin&rsquo; for you. But you&rsquo;ve failed to win
  the best in her. Dabb, I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone ever dared to hit you
  this way. I don&rsquo;t care a d&mdash;&mdash; how angry you get, if I can
  only make you see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making me see red, cowboy,&rdquo; replied Dabb,
  hoarsely, and the blood that he confessed colored his sight certainly showed
  in his face. &ldquo;But go ahead. I&rsquo;ve not the nerve to pull a gun on
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, I always had a hunch you weren&rsquo;t a bad fellow, under
  your skin. The range claimed you drove hard bargains, and the cowboys
  didn&rsquo;t exactly like you. Maybe that was justified. All the same, as
  ranchers go, you sure were white.... You&rsquo;re rich now. You don&rsquo;t
  have to eat, sleep, drink, whistle, and smoke business. Pay some attention to
  your young and pretty wife! Like you did before you married her!&mdash;Sol
  Winter told me you were as gay as any young buckaroo in town. Well,
  back-trail yourself. Take the girl away occasionally, to Kansas City or
  Denver. California in winter.... And before long, old-timer, you&rsquo;ll be
  glad. If you don&rsquo;t do this, sure as I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; here, Amy
  is goin&rsquo; to the bad.... That&rsquo;s what I came to say and
  that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock ended abruptly, forced by the older man&rsquo;s torture. Dabb writhed
  in his chair. Fury and shame contested with the sense of fairness that seemed
  dragged out of his depths. Suddenly he burst out into the wildest of range
  profanity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine, Dabb,&rdquo; returned Rock, with a laugh. &ldquo;But do you
  mean it for me or yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rancher wheeled in his chair, clawed at things on his desk, bent his
  head, and jerked it aloft, then with action growing slower and slower he
  lighted another cigar. When again he turned, his face was half enveloped in
  smoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a&mdash;queer one&mdash;Rock,&rdquo; he stammered, with
  incoherence gradually clearing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to order
  you out of my office&mdash;or to believe I&rsquo;m the d&mdash;&mdash;d old
  fool you make me out.... Anyway, it&rsquo;s too sudden. You&rsquo;ve hit me
  where I live. And it hurts like sixty.... But you talk like a man. And
  I&rsquo;m not yet so set in my mind that I can&rsquo;t learn from any
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It took nerve to brave John Dabb in his den, but I&rsquo;m sure
  glad,&rdquo; replied Rock, frankly smiling, with all tension eased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not convinced,&rdquo; returned Dabb, doggedly, &ldquo;but
  I&rsquo;m some staggered. If the truth turns out as straight as your
  talk&mdash;well, young man, you&rsquo;re on parole till I find out.... Now
  since you&rsquo;ve presumed to advise me on a delicate matter, I&rsquo;ll
  retaliate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Throw your gun, John. I&rsquo;m ready to duck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quit Preston!&rdquo; cut out Dabb.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; snapped Rock, just as sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But <i>why</i> can&rsquo;t you say? If you feel a thing keen enough
  to show, why can&rsquo;t you give me a reason?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know the range, Rock. Some things just can&rsquo;t be
  said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And why? Because they can&rsquo;t be proved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll stick to Preston until these damned underhand
  rumors are proved&mdash;or until somebody suffers for startin&rsquo;
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That may work out too late for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to risk it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you do any gun-throwing in defense of Preston, it&rsquo;ll ruin
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That depends. But it&rsquo;s far-fetched, Dabb. It&rsquo;s way out
  of probability.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;if you&rsquo;re sweet on Thiry Preston,&rdquo;
  rejoined Dabb.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between you and me&mdash;I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So!&mdash;That accounts. I&rsquo;ll respect your confidence, Rock.
  She&rsquo;s a charming girl. It&rsquo;s too bad that she.... There I go
  again. I&rsquo;m as gabby as the old women. Suppose you run along and let me
  collect my wits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock accepted his dismissal with good grace, feeling exultant over the
  unexpected response. However, as he was closing the door, Dabb called him
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgot something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I ought to tell
  you I&rsquo;ve broken business relations with Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Last Friday, when Preston was here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I ask what were the business relations?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston had the small end of a cattle deal with me. I bought him
  out. And then I canceled all beef orders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dabb lowered his glance at this juncture and absent-mindedly drew figures
  on his desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did Preston take that?&rdquo; inquired Rock, after a
  moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kicked about the cattle deal. But I took it he was relieved to get
  out of selling me more beef.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Relieved.&mdash;What you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He just struck me that way. Didn&rsquo;t ask me why. I was glad. My
  reason was good, but I could scarcely divulge it to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mind tellin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; went on Rock, leisurely rolling a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d mind. It would necessitate violating some
  one&rsquo;s confidence. You&rsquo;ll have to find out for yourself,
  Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon so. Well, I&rsquo;m such a dumb hombre it may take me
  long.&mdash;By the way, Dabb, are you still head of the Territory Cattle
  Association?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I resigned. Hesbitt was recently elected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee! Sorry to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why so? Hesbitt is said to be a better executive than I
  was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He never was a cowboy,&rdquo; returned Rock, significantly.
  &ldquo;Good day, Dabb. Reckon I&rsquo;ll meet up with you at the rodeo and
  the dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Likely. I can&rsquo;t very well take to bull-dogging steers again.
  But I&rsquo;ll drop in on Amy&rsquo;s dance for a couple if I break a
  leg.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re shoutin&rsquo;, John,&rdquo; replied Rock, gladly,
  and went out.</p>

  <p>There were bustle and activity on the street. Wagontongue was filling up
  for the Fourth. Rock saw that the town hall had been gayly decorated in red,
  white and blue. Flags were showing. Youngsters were already setting off
  firecrackers. The hitching-rails were lined with saddle-horses. Down the long
  main street, wagons came toiling in from the desert. Cowboys, Mexicans,
  Indians were numerous, mostly in the vicinity of the saloon, Happy Days. Rock
  swore pleasantly to himself, in his assurance that he had walked in or out of
  this saloon, cowboy&mdash;happy and drunk, for the last time.</p>

  <p>An hour of sauntering to and fro provided Rock with some amusement and
  interest, but his main object, which was to allow Clink Peeples the meeting
  he was reported to be seeking, did not materialize. Whereupon he went to get
  dinner, finding the restaurant crowded. After that he sat in the hotel lobby
  until he could not stand it any longer. Then in his room he killed some more
  time, dwelling again on his interview with Dabb.</p>

  <p>It had been of both good and bad cheer&mdash;good in its intimation of
  possible contentment for Amy, if he could only be instrumental in rousing the
  best in her instead of inciting the worst; and bad for himself, inasmuch as
  it added materially to the persistent, evil rumor hovering like a gathering
  cloud over the Prestons.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon, rather late, Rock walked round to see Winter. He was
  received almost with open arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, you been drinkin&rsquo;?&rdquo; expostulated Rock, holding his
  friend at arm&rsquo;s-length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. That is, not red liquor. But I shore been drinkin&rsquo; in
  Thiry&rsquo;s sweet smiles an&rsquo; words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. The Prestons got in early. Drove all day yesterday an&rsquo;
  half into the night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t expect her till tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, she has been in half a dozen times,&rdquo; went on Winter,
  eager to reveal the momentous fact. &ldquo;Asked for you <i>every</i>
  time!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, you lyin&rsquo; old geezer! My heart might stand her
  askin&rsquo; once.&mdash;But six times!... I ought to choke you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, mebbe it&rsquo;s not all gospel truth. When she first run in
  she was her old nice sweet cool self. Kissed me. Said she an&rsquo; Alice
  were all fixed up nice out at my house. She asked if I&rsquo;d seen you.
  An&rsquo; I told her I hadn&rsquo;t yet today, but thet you&rsquo;d be in.
  Then she said Ash hadn&rsquo;t come to town an&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t
  comin&rsquo;. I was too surprised to say more&rsquo;n thet mebbe once
  she&rsquo;d have a real good time. She blushed at thet. An hour later she
  came in again, somehow different. She bought buntin&rsquo;. She was
  helpin&rsquo; Amy Dabb decorate the dance-hall. Asked had I seen you yet,
  an&rsquo; I said no. She went out an&rsquo; pretty soon came back, a little
  more different. She had a red spot in each cheek. An&rsquo; so she came
  an&rsquo; went, till the last time, a little while ago, when she was with
  Amy. Then you bet she didn&rsquo;t ask about you. He! He! He!... I&rsquo;ll
  bet you a million Amy got in some good licks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, you can laugh about that!&rdquo; ejaculated Rock, with a
  groan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These here girls strike me funny. True, shore as you&rsquo;re born,
  Amy had been fillin&rsquo; poor Thiry full of guff about how wild you was
  over her, an&rsquo; mebbe was yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course she had. It&rsquo;s terrible. Thiry will be disgusted
  with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, she wasn&rsquo;t, not so you could notice it,&rdquo; said Sol,
  dryly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ve the rottenest luck of any cowpuncher who ever
  forked a horse,&rdquo; went on Rock, raving. &ldquo;Here all day that
  fire-eatin&rsquo; Dabb woman has been ruinin&rsquo; me with my
  girl&mdash;when I&rsquo;ve been tryin&rsquo; to help her. If that isn&rsquo;t
  like her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do, Rock?&rdquo; queried Winter, with quick
  interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I went and made friends with John Dabb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did? Holy mavericks! What was your idee, son?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock heard Winter, but only vaguely, for he was rushing out to the door,
  where through the window he had espied Thiry Preston.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Thiry did not see him until he emerged, to all appearances in
  a normal manner for a young man to step out on the sidewalk. The action,
  however, brought him right in front of Thiry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, hello!&rdquo; he said, forcing a pleasant surprise to hide his
  rapture, as he doffed his sombrero. &ldquo;Heard you were here. Really
  didn&rsquo;t expect you till tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She greeted him shyly, with absence of that inhibited expression which
  marked her meetings with him at Sunset Pass. She wore a light-blue dress and
  a new bonnet, the rather wide brim of which shaded her face somewhat. Still,
  he saw that her cheeks were not pale and her eyes not tranquil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We started at daybreak yesterday morning,&rdquo; she was saying.
  &ldquo;The boys were no good at all, and the youngsters simply mad to
  come&mdash;so Dad sent us off a day ahead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. The kids will have the time of their lives.
  Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goodness only knows. In one of the stores somewhere.... Oh, Ash
  stayed home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She spoke this as if it was an afterthought, scarcely important.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; replied Rock, with constraint, though he tingled.
  &ldquo;Well. It&rsquo;s too bad, if you&rsquo;re disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so greatly relieved I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
  myself,&rdquo; she replied, with unexpected candor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  remember a Fourth that Ash hasn&rsquo;t spoiled by getting drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I walk with you a step?&rdquo; asked Rock, changing the
  subject. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may. I&rsquo;m on my last errand,&rdquo; she replied, and waved
  a gay hand at Winter, who was looking on with a broad smile.</p>

  <p>Rock fell in with her short quick steps and made careful remarks about the
  weather, and the town being full of people, until they reached the
  baker&rsquo;s, where she said she was to order things for Mrs. Winter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you,&rdquo; said Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you afraid to walk into a bakeshop with a girl?&rdquo; she
  asked, and the wide bonnet-brim tilted just far enough and long enough for
  him to catch a flash of gray eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;exactly afraid,&rdquo; confessed Rock, who, as a matter
  of truth, was scared into consternation because this could not really be
  actually happening out of a dream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard&mdash;recently&mdash;you could march
  into a lion&rsquo;s den&mdash;for a&mdash;for certain people,&rdquo; she
  said, distantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh, reckon I could&mdash;for&mdash;for a certain
  <i>person</i>,&rdquo; replied Rock, beginning lamely and ending valiantly.
  That brought the blue bonnet-brim down to hide most of her face. Rock,
  however, thought he caught a glimpse of a coloring cheek. He escorted her
  into the store, stood beside her while she gave her orders, and accompanied
  her out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to wait here for Allie. She won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo;
  said Thiry, stopping outside before the window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope she&rsquo;ll be late,&rdquo; returned Rock, trying vainly to
  find himself.</p>

  <p>Presently she lifted her head so that the bonnet no longer could be
  anathematized. Rock devoured her lovely face before he realized it had never
  worn such an expression for him. Doubt, disdain, petulance!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to the dance,&rdquo; she said. It was not a
  question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll drop in for a peep,&rdquo; he replied, his heart
  giving symptoms of pyrotechnics.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to mask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fun otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you tell me what you&rsquo;ll wear?&rdquo; she asked,
  sweetly&mdash;too sweetly not to be dangerous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, that&rsquo;d spoil the fun. I sure want to fool you,&rdquo;
  he protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you not already fooled me?&rdquo; she went on, with bitterness
  tinged by pathos.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not!&rdquo; he shot at her, swift to speak his sudden
  passion. It startled her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock, you have a great deal to disprove and more to
  prove,&rdquo; she said, wide strange eyes on his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry!&rdquo; he gasped, suddenly beside himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would not tell <i>me</i> what you were going to wear&mdash;so
  I&rsquo;d recognize you first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he burst out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to know now.... You would not see <i>me</i>,
  anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He could only stare mutely. His bosom seemed rent with a
  conflict&mdash;the objective belief in anything she might utter, and the
  bewildering undercurrent that betrayed her. Wild recollection of her
  father&rsquo;s sly predictions further added to his state.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rock,&rdquo; she went on, without the scorn, &ldquo;I had
  better explain my rather bold words. This dance was to be the first gay happy
  time for me&mdash;since I grew up. Dad somehow prevented Ash from coming to
  town. He filled me with&mdash;with beliefs about how <i>you</i> would make it
  wonderful for me. I have no one but my brothers, and they all have their
  girls. I&mdash;I dreamed myself into... no matter what.... Then I come to
  town to have my ears filled to burning&mdash;all day long. The dance was to
  be given for you! You wouldn&rsquo;t even dance with any other woman but
  <i>her</i>! You were an old lover renewing his vows!
  You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, hush!&rdquo; interposed Trueman, in rage, despair, and
  exaltation, all bewilderingly mingled. &ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t care
  what anyone said to you about my old affairs. But if <i>you</i> care, then I
  hate the very thought of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I don&rsquo;t know how much, or why, or if I care. But I
  trusted you and that woman has killed it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, Thiry, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he implored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a secret understanding between you and
  her&mdash;for this dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there is. But it&rsquo;s sure not sentiment on my part,&rdquo;
  he replied, humbly. &ldquo;Thiry, if you won&rsquo;t trust me, I shall have
  to give her away. And I never did that to a girl in my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could I trust a man who would betray any woman&mdash;much less
  her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t. And I deserve that rebuke. But, Thiry,
  I&rsquo;m dumfounded. Dear child, be reasonable. Why, I was going to get
  <i>my</i> happy time just spying upon you from some corner. I never dared
  hope to get to dance with you. Good Heavens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I meant to dance only with my brothers, and perhaps one or
  two of the boys I know&mdash;and all the rest with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry Preston, you tell me this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
  cried, and failed to find adequate conclusion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I tell you,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it
  at home, because I didn&rsquo;t know. But that&rsquo;s no
  difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t. I should have made some wild dream come
  true. But, Thiry, it&rsquo;s not too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it is,&rdquo; she said, disconsolately, yet she seemed to
  hunger to be persuaded. &ldquo;She has spoiled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I meant to befriend Amy Dabb.
  She needs it, Heaven knows, as you will see for yourself tomorrow night. But
  if you let her jealous tongue spoil <i>anythin&rsquo;</i> for you, I&rsquo;m
  through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I could forgive a great deal, I think, but no bold
  lie,&rdquo; she murmured, her grave eyes piercing him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would not lie to you, to save my life,&rdquo; he returned, in
  weary cold finality.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I apologize. It is I who am a little suspicious,&rdquo; she
  returned, softly. &ldquo;Trueman, I make this excuse. I&rsquo;m not used to
  intrigue, to deceit.... Oh yes, I&rsquo;m a woman and I haven&rsquo;t told
  you my real feelings. And I cannot. But I could never cope with Mrs. Dabb.
  She read my soul and tortured it. She thought I might l&mdash;like you and
  meant to destroy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, did she destroy what little there might have been?&rdquo;
  asked Rock.</p>

  <p>She averted her face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m all excited.
  When I get back home I&rsquo;ll be appalled. But, oh, I&mdash;I want to have
  this dance! You&rsquo;ll understand me, Trueman, won&rsquo;t you?
  That&rsquo;s one thing I do trust.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. But you are strange. Sure there never was a
  girl like you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; she asked, giving him again the gray sweet
  wonder of her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, I could not find words here,&rdquo; he replied, striving for
  calm. Indeed, where or when could he ever do justice to her strangeness, her
  inconsistency, her innocence and simplicity? &ldquo;Perhaps at the
  dance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps at the dance&mdash;then&mdash;if you disprove much and
  prove more I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The arrival of Alice Preston, breathless and pink and merry, checked
  Rock&rsquo;s impassioned reply that otherwise he could not have resisted,
  even if Thiry had never completed her thought-compelling sentence. The girls,
  laughing and talking, started for home, and Rock accompanied them toward the
  corner.</p>

  <p>Just before they arrived there, a man and a woman hove in sight. Evidently
  she was trying to hurry away from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you no&mdash;no!&rdquo; she cried, in a rage. Then Rock
  recognized the voice and the blazing black eyes. Amy Dabb! The man was a tall
  rider. He wore a red scarf, and his face was almost as red.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See heah, sweetheart, you cain&rsquo;t come thet with me,&rdquo; he
  drawled, blocking her way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up, you d&mdash;&mdash; fool! Some one might hear you,&rdquo;
  she cried, passionately and low.</p>

  <p>Rock with a stride and a leap was upon them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody did hear you, Amy. Rustle now, with the girls,&rdquo; said
  Rock, sharply, as he gave the rider a hard thrust backward and then
  confronted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mister Red Scarf!&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="first">THE red-scarfed rider had evidently had a drink or two, but
  he appeared level-headed, and slowly the devilish geniality with which he had
  accosted Amy Dabb faded into cold, watchful speculation. His tawny gaze swept
  Rock from head to foot, and back again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mister Big Hat!&rdquo; he replied, with capital imitation of
  Rock&rsquo;s greeting to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aboot had thet reckoned,&rdquo; returned the rider, guardedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Hesbitt&rsquo;s foreman, Peeples,&rdquo; went on Rock,
  curtly. &ldquo;He told me you were lookin&rsquo; for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Reckon you didn&rsquo;t look very hard,&rdquo; rejoined Rock,
  in slight derision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I cain&rsquo;t say there was any particular call to
  rustle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus these two range-riders measured each other. Rock&rsquo;s reaction was
  vastly diverse from that following his encounter with Ash Preston. The
  foreman of Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfit appeared to belong to that type of cowboy
  whom Rock was wont to believe the salt of the earth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not drunk,&rdquo; replied Rock. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it
  you insult a married woman on the street?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is thet any of your bizness?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It shore is. I&rsquo;m an old friend of Amy Dabb&rsquo;s. Rode for
  her husband. Reckon it&rsquo;s not exaggeratin&rsquo; to claim I&rsquo;m his
  friend, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Rock, I apologize,&rdquo; returned the foreman, readily,
  though resentfully. &ldquo;But honest to God, it shore ain&rsquo;t because I
  think I ought to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard what she said, and your answer. Peeples, you ought to be
  horsewhipped for that. Then you wouldn&rsquo;t let her pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, hell! She shore wasn&rsquo;t thet way when we was alone
  indoors, last time I seen her,&rdquo; said Peeples. &ldquo;She plumb
  surprised me&mdash;made me sore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wonder, if you thought bad of her,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, feeling
  his way. This man could be talked to. &ldquo;Reckon you don&rsquo;t know Amy
  well. She&rsquo;s a lonesome and unhappy girl. She met you, liked you,
  because you&rsquo;re a good-lookin&rsquo; and interestin&rsquo; cowboy. And I
  reckon she let you hold her hand&mdash;maybe kiss her, though that&rsquo;s
  pretty reckless even for Amy. You scared her, most likely. And afterward she
  got to thinkin&rsquo;, remembered she was married, and made up her mind next
  time to cut you. It&rsquo;s the way of some women, Peeples. Tough on a
  fellow, but he&rsquo;s to blame. Now, tell me square, don&rsquo;t you think
  it was kind of low-down to brace her, right on the street?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I reckon it was, if she&rsquo;s what you seem to
  think,&rdquo; responded Peeples, staring hard. &ldquo;I shore
  didn&rsquo;t....An&rsquo; how aboot my takin&rsquo; you as a slick
  hombre&mdash;a liar&mdash;sweet on her yourself, an&rsquo; wantin&rsquo; the
  inside track?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peeples, you can take me any way you like,&rdquo; responded Rock,
  speaking hard. &ldquo;But if you do it that particular way you&rsquo;ve got
  trouble on your hands right now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I aboot reckoned,&rdquo; nodded the rider. &ldquo;Strikes me
  I&rsquo;ve got to take a lot for granted aboot you. Shore you know more aboot
  me than I do aboot you. It ain&rsquo;t a very square deal all
  around.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would take your word, if you shook on it,&rdquo; replied
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I guess I&rsquo;d take yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Peeples. We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; somewhere,&rdquo;
  said Rock, more heartily. It always warmed him to be taken seriously when he
  was in earnest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my word, confidentially. I&rsquo;m
  not sweet on Amy Dabb. Only want to help her, before it&rsquo;s too
  late....And more, I am darn good and awful sweet on some other
  girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, when occasion comes I can be as high-falutin&rsquo; as you or
  any other man,&rdquo; responded Peeples, even more heartily. &ldquo;Much
  obliged for your confidence. I&rsquo;ll ask Amy&rsquo;s pardon&mdash;tell her
  plumb straight she overdid it a little, an&rsquo; advise her to cut thet game
  with cowboys in future.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. We can shake on that, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink on it, too,&rdquo; responded the other, as they
  gripped hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peeples, I&rsquo;m off liquor for good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say. What&rsquo;s the matter? Is it religion or the
  girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe both,&rdquo; laughed Rock. &ldquo;Now, Peeples, tell me why
  you were lookin&rsquo; for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Easier&rsquo;n your other cracks,&rdquo; replied Peeples,
  laconically. &ldquo;I kept hearin&rsquo; aboot you out on the range. Then
  lately you come back an&rsquo; went to ride for Preston. Thet made me
  curious, an&rsquo; I reckon I jest wanted to meet up with you an&rsquo; see
  for myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you know how one cowboy sizes up another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Very often wrong, Peeples,&rdquo; returned Rock, with
  gravity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. But we&rsquo;re old hands at this range game. You might be a
  deep an&rsquo; clever cuss, an&rsquo; so might I. But I reckon it&rsquo;d be
  a poor idee to gamble on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a losin&rsquo; bet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, do you know one of them queer range shadows is creepin&rsquo;
  over the Prestons?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so,&rdquo; replied Rock, gloomily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many of them shadows did you ever heah aboot that didn&rsquo;t
  grow wuss?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; admitted Rock. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo;
  this one will blow over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Natural. But if it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;if it clouds up
  black&mdash;you&rsquo;re shore goin&rsquo; to get rained on, cowboy,&rdquo;
  said Peeples, with dark significance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peeples, I like Gage Preston,&rdquo; went on Rock. &ldquo;Do you
  know him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. Like him fine, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take to Hesbitt,&rdquo; mused Rock, as if making
  comparisons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore I never did, either,&rdquo; admitted Peeples. &ldquo;None of
  the outfit never did. But&mdash;wal, I&rsquo;m responsible for his stock.
  An&rsquo; you can bet your bottom dollar I&rsquo;d never be responsible for
  Preston&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither would I. My job is bossin&rsquo; the younger boys, the
  twins and Al. Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By sight.... See heah, Rock, does Preston split his
  outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;m sort of handlin&rsquo; the small end of it.
  These boys are pretty young. We don&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; to do with
  Preston&rsquo;s butcherin&rsquo;. Of course I&rsquo;ve only been with them a
  little while. But I know for a fact that it&rsquo;s two years and more since
  Preston made his younger sons do any of the bloody work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hell you say!&rdquo; ejaculated Peeples, with a dancing of the
  brown flecks in his tawny eyes. &ldquo;Hesbitt doesn&rsquo;t know thet.
  It&rsquo;s shore news. Mebbe it explains why all the cowpunchers who ever
  rode for Preston left quick an&rsquo; spoke well of all but Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peeples, I don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; complained Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t? Wal, these punchers went heah an&rsquo; there, all
  over the range, speakin&rsquo; good of Gage. If they had knowed any bad they
  shore would have told it. But if&mdash;I say <i>if</i>, mind you&mdash;there
  was anythin&rsquo; off color, they had no chance to see it, an&rsquo;
  didn&rsquo;t stay long enough to suspect. All the same, Preston had the
  benefit of honest cowboys in his outfit. D&mdash;&mdash; deep an&rsquo;
  slick, <i>if</i> thet&rsquo;s the secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you imaginin&rsquo; a lot, Peeples?&rdquo; queried
  Rock, made testy by the rider&rsquo;s keen deductions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. But how&rsquo;d you figger if you was me&mdash;on the
  outside?&rdquo; demanded Peeples.</p>

  <p>Rock found that an embarrassing and confounding query.</p>

  <p>Peeples spread his hands. &ldquo;You know d&mdash;&mdash; well you&rsquo;d
  figger same as me,&rdquo; he said, succinctly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; now aboot
  your connection with Preston. Speaks high for him to have you in his outfit.
  True Rock, clean an&rsquo; square range-rider! Old hand at the game! Rode for
  the best ranchers in the Territory!... Sounds awful good when some new
  cattleman like Hesbitt or some wonderin&rsquo; puncher gets to talkin&rsquo;.
  ... Rock, if Preston keeps you out there it&rsquo;s a safe bet he <i>is</i>
  rustlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; will ring you in with him, by hook or
  crook.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your angle?&rdquo; muttered Rock, in deep thought.
  &ldquo;Suppose I were to tell it to Ash Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;d drive me into a gun deal. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;d be
  breakin&rsquo; confidence. I took it you aboot asked my opinion. After all,
  Rock, I cain&rsquo;t prove nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, and indeed his
  lips were tight as he spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, thet&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d expect. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  say a little more. It always struck me thet this bizness of Ash
  Preston&rsquo;s chasin&rsquo; the punchers away from Sunset Pass, on account
  of his sister, was aboot half fraud. I&rsquo;ll bet thet&rsquo;s a put-up job
  between Ash an&rsquo; his father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Sure he tried to chase me away,&rdquo;
  acknowledged Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; played hell doin&rsquo; it! Ash would have a sweet time
  chasin&rsquo; me, too, you can lay to thet,&rdquo; retorted Peeples, as he
  spat emphatically. &ldquo;An&rsquo; last, Rock, take my hunch for what
  it&rsquo;s worth. As I&rsquo;d take yours.... Grab the girl an&rsquo; raise
  the dust away from Sunset Pass. For if anythin&rsquo; ever comes of this
  deal&mdash;as I suspect&mdash;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re still with Preston in
  any capacity, I swear I cain&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;d ever square yourself
  on the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>The new town hall was the finest structure in Wagontongue, and the civic
  authorities, who happened to be mostly members of the Cattle Association,
  were proud of it and its expression of a progressive and prosperous
  community.</p>

  <p>It was of Spanish design, low, rambling, many arched and aisled, painted
  white, with red tiled roof. Whoever designed it must have had in mind a place
  for public functions as well as business. The outside had been draped with
  flags and bunting in celebration of the national holiday. Two aisles with
  arched walls formed the outside of a large <i>patio</i>. Here and everywhere
  gay many-colored Chinese lanterns hung, singly from the tops of the arches,
  and in strings across from wall to wall. Flowers and desert shrubbery lined
  the walks and circled the fountain, where water tinkled musically. Many
  chairs had that day been added to the few benches up and down the aisles, in
  the vine-bowered corners, and along the walls. The large hall, which was to
  answer many purposes for the townspeople, had been cleared and cleaned, its
  floor polished, and its ceiling rendered bewilderingly colored with endless
  streams of bunting. It was empty except for straight chairs set against the
  wall, on all sides, except at one end, where the platform had obviously been
  arranged for an orchestra. Flags and sage and evergreen furnished the
  interior decoration, very simply and attractively.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Trueman Rock strolled from the town hall, which he had inspected along
  with a multitude of visitors, back to his hotel. The street was full of
  people. Lobby and saloon were noisy, smoky. He went to his room to avoid the
  crowd. Events had multiplied already this day. What would the dance and the
  Fourth bring about? Rock was inclined to the idea that it might be just as
  well for him to spend the rest of the day in his room. When he left it next
  he would be in masquerade.</p>

  <p>Rock made himself comfortable in a big chair before his open window, and
  prepared to rest, smoke, and think the tedious hours away.</p>

  <p>He ran over in mind a few of the many singular events of the last two
  days. Thiry Preston&rsquo;s astounding, bewildering, unbelievable attitude!
  That had not come first, but it always stood first in reflection. His talk
  with Sol Winter about the beeves, with Amy Dabb about her affairs and the
  masquerade, with John Dabb about his wife, with Clink Peeples about Amy and
  the Prestons. That morning Rock had met Hesbitt face to face, to be coldly
  snubbed. This from the new president of the Cattlemen&rsquo;s Association was
  not reassuring. Ash Preston was in town, hiding. Al had confided this bit of
  dismaying news. He had discovered it quite by accident, through a Mexican,
  and believed that Ash had ridden in under cover of night. The Mexican had
  said Ash was not drinking. This was even more disturbing than the fact of his
  presence. Rock had cautioned Al not to tell Thiry. It was possible Ash would
  not recognize Thiry in her masquerade, and she would have some hours of
  pleasure, at least till she unmasked. But what was Ash up to? Last night the
  Cattlemen&rsquo;s Association had met, and though the conference was not
  supposedly secret, they had most certainly locked the doors on many ranchers
  and cowboys. This news went the rounds of the hotels and saloons.</p>

  <p>After Rock had ruminated over these matters he relegated them to oblivion
  and returned to the puzzle about Thiry. He could not attend to it soberly; he
  could not reason it out calmly. Nor could he trust his ecstatic convictions.
  Gage Preston was a calculating, lying father, trying, for some occult reason,
  to urge Rock on. Sol Winter was a loving, dreaming old fool. And Rock called
  himself something similar, minus the old.</p>

  <p>Yet how incontestable Thiry&rsquo;s strange looks and words! They were
  facts. He knew he was now madly in love, but he could still hear and see.
  What in the world had gone on in her mind? Preston had incited something. She
  had committed herself to something before she left Sunset Pass. It did not
  matter in what degree she had committed herself&mdash;for he was involved.
  How that thrilled through Rock! Then Amy Dabb had shown the cloven hoof. That
  stirred heat in Rock&rsquo;s veins. He could fancy her pouring confidences
  into Thiry&rsquo;s innocent ears. False confidences that Rock thought would
  have hurt and poisoned and destroyed&mdash;killed what little interest he
  might have won from Thiry.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Thiry had seemed to have admitted him, most probably with
  all unconsciousness, into a strange intimacy that was not compatible with her
  desire to have him leave Sunset Pass. This softening, whatever it portended,
  created a tumult in Rock. No matter if she did not know! Some day, when it
  was too late, he could tell her. What an exalting prospect!</p>

  <p>Thiry had been upset by Amy Dabb, had been rendered angry, doubtful, full
  of scorn&mdash;and, yes, jealous! That was the most amazing thing of all.
  Thiry was a girl&mdash;like other girls&mdash;except, of course, lovelier by
  far, sweeter by far. If she were jealous&mdash;if it were actually
  true&mdash;then he owed Amy Dabb a great debt. Amy was certainly the kind to
  make a high-spirited, complex girl like Thiry very uncomfortable
  indeed&mdash;strike fire from her, put her on her mettle! If Thiry had
  secretly or even unconsciously been tenderly stirred by her father&rsquo;s
  avowal of Rock&rsquo;s love, that would account for her reaction to Amy and
  to him. And Rock sat out the afternoon, thinking, dreaming, with music in his
  heart.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Darkness had long set in when he left the hotel. He had waited till late,
  and then the task of donning his masquerade had not been inconsiderable. His
  appearance, at least of late years, had not occasioned him any bother. But
  now he was hard to please. Half the time he believed he had never looked so
  well, and the other half he imagined he looked huge, awkward, silly. At
  least, however, he managed to satisfy himself sufficiently to venture forth,
  amused at himself, keen as any cowboy for his first dance. It was well, he
  thought, that he had purchased a black hat. Its shape troubled him, but would
  be all the better for his disguise.</p>

  <p>In the lobby of the hotel there had been a number of people, several in
  masquerade, and most ridiculously garbed. Rock tried his disguise, voice as
  well as suit and mask, upon the clerk, Clark the proprietor, and the porter.
  They had not recognized him; wherefore he headed toward the town hall,
  treading on air.</p>

  <p>The public square, in the center of which stood the hall, appeared crowded
  with noisy youngsters, scattered groups of men and women, many Mexicans of
  both sexes, lounging Indians, whose colored raiment vied with the others, and
  a host of cowboys in their range clothes.</p>

  <p>Rock ran the gauntlet of merry jests, admiring glances from dusky eyes,
  laughter and query, to the entrance at the main corridor of the hall. Inside
  the door was a gate, guarded by men, one of whom was the town sheriff, very
  important and pompous, with his silver badge conspicuous. Two placards struck
  Rock&rsquo;s eye. One read: =No Admittance to Anyone not in Masquerade=. And
  the other sign, larger, read: CHECK YOUR HARDWARE AND BOTTLE.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, gambler!&rdquo; greeted the sheriff. &ldquo;Scuse me while I
  search you. Mrs. Dabb&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His second slap at Rock located the gun under the long frock coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Not on the hip! Hangin&rsquo; low, eh? Wal, cowboy, unbuckle
  an&rsquo; pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The heavy gun-belt went into the hands of an attendant, who deposited it
  on a shelf where already a row of weapons glittered. Rock received a
  ticket.</p>

  <p>Rock passed on down the corridor to where it opened into the <i>patio</i>.
  There was music somewhere and sound of voices and laughter. Then he saw
  masqueraders in goodly numbers, and he strolled down the right aisle, where
  under every arch gay young people, safe in their disguises, ogled the
  strollers and made remarks. The lights from the lanterns were just strong
  enough to lend glamour and softness to the Spanish aisles, the beautiful
  <i>patio</i> and the brightly clad maskers.</p>

  <p>Cowboys were present in numbers, all masked, some of them with ludicrous
  false faces, and some in chaps and boots and spurs, in gaudy vests and
  blazing scarves. Among the girls, three out of five were dressed in Mexican
  garb, no doubt owing to its color and charm. Rock noticed one girl, striking
  in Indian costume of exceeding richness, who he stared at as she passed by
  alone. He strolled around the <i>patio</i>, peeped in at the dance-hall, the
  floor of which shone like a shield. A few masqueraders in a group were just
  inside, gayly guessing at one another&rsquo;s identity. The musicians had not
  arrived.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the main corridor again, Rock halted against the wall to watch
  the fast arriving guests come in. It would indeed be a gala night for
  Wagontongue. From outside came the faint reports of firecrackers. Merry
  laughter everywhere! All seemed most curious, friendly, yet aloof in their
  own safe disguises. So far there did not appear to be any comic costumes,
  although there were many huge-nosed false faces.</p>

  <p>A girl, slight of stature, passed Rock to peer at him with challenging
  eyes, disguised if not hidden by a red mask. Her costume was Spanish, gold
  and black, very graceful and pretty. It could not be Amy, for surely she
  would wear something magnificent. A masker in cowboy attire accosted her, to
  be gayly repulsed. She passed on, and Rock forgot her in his growing,
  searching gaze for some one he would know the instant she appeared. What
  would Thiry wear? Guests were arriving more thickly now. Rock heard the
  tuning of orchestra instruments. There were bustle and excitement, confusion
  owing to the evident fact that all were strangers. A clever masquerader,
  impersonating a negro preacher, passed; Rock noted a woman, typical of the
  pioneer West; then came an Irish laborer, covered with dust, red-headed, with
  a stubby pipe stuck in his false face; next a Spanish <i>matador</i>,
  admirably gotten up in what must have been a real bullfighter&rsquo;s
  costume. A shepherd boy came arm in arm with a dairy maid. These two knew
  each other, surely. A cowboy&mdash;Rock knew he was one from his bowed
  legs&mdash;presented a capital counterfeit of a cavalry officer, though his
  costume had seen better days. Then entered a bandit, an outlaw, a miner, and
  a clown. Rock decided that the masculine contingent was to afford the humor
  of the occasion; the feminine departed rarely from the eternal vanity. But
  that pleased Rock. Let the men play ugly, funny parts; let the woman typify
  beauty.</p>

  <p>Some one took his arm lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas tardes, señor</i>,&rdquo; said a low voice at his
  elbow.</p>

  <p>Rock bowed gallantly to the slim creature on his arm. He did not recognize
  her, but saw that she was the Spanish girl in gold and black.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas tardes, señorita</i>,&rdquo; replied Rock, peering into
  the black holes in the red mask.</p>

  <p>She averted her face and walked with him, surely aware of the attention
  they roused. Rock grudgingly accorded her the admiration she deserved. He had
  wanted to save all for Thiry. Surely this could not be Thiry, although a
  Spanish costume like this was deceiving. Her little head, half hidden by the
  <i>mantilla</i>, did not come up quite to his shoulder. Thiry was taller, and
  not so slim.</p>

  <p>Rock grasped suddenly that there appeared to be a little pressure on his
  arm, a gradual but sure guidance of his steps. Being intent upon this unknown
  lady who had taken possession of him, Rock had not observed where they were
  heading. He was to find that they were entering the dance-hall, where many
  masqueraders had assembled, plainly awaiting the mysterious first partner
  that chance might bestow upon them. This Spanish girl was enterprising, not
  to say bold. Rock felt himself further drawn into the subtle charm of the
  atmosphere. Then the orchestra burst into music, a languorous Spanish waltz,
  once Rock&rsquo;s great favorite. The girl who had led him there swayed to
  the rhythm, toward him, slowly lifting her hand to his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You handsome gambler! You don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo; she cried, in
  arch reproach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Do you like me in this costume?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great! You sure are a Spanish girl. Fooled me plumb
  good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a soul recognized me,&rdquo; she said, in delight.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell no one but you.... Come, this is your old favorite
  waltz.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before Rock knew what was happening she was in his arms, light as
  thistle-down, and they were whirling, gliding to dreamy strains that found
  the old chord deep in his memory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, hold me tighter,&rdquo; she whispered, and leaned back
  against his arm, to look up at him. The dark eyes seemed inscrutable wells
  under the red mask.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behave yourself, Mrs. Dabb,&rdquo; he returned, warningly, with a
  laugh. &ldquo;Reckon I don&rsquo;t know quite all due my hostess, but sure
  not that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold me tighter, True. This may be the last wicked, happy time of
  my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t expect to die?&rdquo; queried Rock, in mock
  alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll have to hug you,&rdquo; she
  went on, and she did, to Rock&rsquo;s confusion. &ldquo;Oh, I could hug you
  and kiss you before everybody!... Trueman, <i>what</i> did you do to my
  husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I do anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Rock, helpless in the
  unexpectedness of this attack. His old knowledge of Amy&rsquo;s
  resourcefulness tried in vain to fortify him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you?... Trueman, he came home the other day, at
  noon&mdash;something unheard-of,&rdquo; she went on, swiftly. &ldquo;He told
  me you&rsquo;d been in to see him. That you had raked him over the coals.
  That you had cleared up something about you and me!... Then he told me he had
  been sore and jealous for a long time. He admitted being mean, selfish,
  suspicious. He&rsquo;d neglected me shamefully. He would turn over a new
  leaf. He would try to be young again.... Oh, he knocked me cold!... Since
  then he has been like he was when he courted me.... And most amazing of all,
  he&rsquo;s to drop in here tonight&mdash;in masquerade. He wouldn&rsquo;t
  even tell what he&rsquo;d wear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Rock, under his breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You should say thank the good Lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I meant that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it, old boy? It&rsquo;s a miracle.&mdash;And
  maybe it&rsquo;s not too late. I was&mdash;I guess, on the ragged
  edge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All past, Amy,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Trueman. You can&rsquo;t kill the devil so
  quickly. But I&rsquo;m happy tonight&mdash;as I haven&rsquo;t been in years.
  ... But I forgot to tell you something else. I oughtn&rsquo;t tell you. But I
  can&rsquo;t act a lie tonight. You know I was scared of Clink Peeples. I
  wondered what you&rsquo;d do to him. I didn&rsquo;t dare turn round after you
  pushed him away from me. I ran. Well, today I met Peeples. Really, Trueman, I
  don&rsquo;t believe it was flattering. Anyway, he apologized for insulting
  me. He owned up to a shameful opinion of me&mdash;for which he said I was
  part to blame. All the same he said he&rsquo;d ask me to marry him if I was
  single, or ever were. Then he advised me to &lsquo;lay off the
  cowpunchers&rsquo;! Fancy that!... Now, Trueman, what did you do or say to
  Clink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy, it was nothin&rsquo; but talkin&rsquo; square,&rdquo; he
  replied, frankly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Square,&rdquo; she murmured, wonderingly, as if she had an
  unexpected glimmering. Then leaning her head forward to his shoulder she grew
  silent. Rock was reminded that the better side of Amy had always come
  uppermost when she was dreamily, happily excited. When she was jealously
  excited she was about as tractable as a wildcat. Round and round they swung
  amid the colorful murmuring throng. The scrape and thud of cowboy boots
  drowned the patter and slide of lighter-footed dancers. Then suddenly the
  music ceased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, you always were such a wonderful dancer,&rdquo; murmured
  Amy, still under a spell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone! I clean forgot I was awful worried about my
  dancin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Trueman. &ldquo;Why, Amy, I haven&rsquo;t
  danced in years!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I had every dance with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You flatter me, Amy. But it sure tickles me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll dance often with Thiry Preston?&rdquo; she
  asked, the old jealousy flaring up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I haven&rsquo;t the nerve yet to ask even one. Besides, I
  probably won&rsquo;t recognize her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah! That girl couldn&rsquo;t disguise herself in a burlap
  sack,&rdquo; returned Amy, flippantly.</p>

  <p>Amy&rsquo;s last words added to Rock&rsquo;s sudden realization of what
  thin ice he was skating on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I&rsquo;ll have to stand for you paying some attention to
  Thiry,&rdquo; went on Amy, passionately. &ldquo;But be careful. You
  don&rsquo;t want me to go to the devil.... If you dance more with her than
  with me&mdash;Lord help <i>her</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy! What nonsense!&rdquo; returned Rock, sharply. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t like your hint.... But don&rsquo;t let anythin&rsquo; spoil this
  dance for you. There&rsquo;s very little chance of my dancin&rsquo; with
  Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i>&rdquo; she replied, mockingly. &ldquo;Come,
  I&rsquo;ll have to go out. Many of my guests are not here yet. I want to
  watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Amy must have had certain duties as a hostess, for outside she slipped
  away from Rock and mingled with the laughing, curious assemblage. He made no
  effort to follow. She had at first roused all his kindlier feelings, then she
  had alienated him. He feared Amy Dabb could not be influenced or led except
  through submission to her imperious will.</p>

  <p>Rock haunted the long corridor, studying the new arrivals, that were still
  coming in numbers. When the music started up again, most of the masqueraders
  went into the hall, if not with partners, then hoping to find them. Rock
  remained at the entrance to the <i>patio</i>, and was standing close to the
  wall, when a small party entered the corridor and came quickly down. There
  appeared to be half a dozen youths in nondescript masquerade, and several
  girls, two of whom, attired in white, stood out prominently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; spoke up a woman to her neighbor on a bench near Rock.
  &ldquo;That girl in white. Colonial wedding-gown! Isn&rsquo;t she just
  lovely? Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the other side of Rock a cowboy, standing at ease, punched his
  comrade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pard, see what&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, pointing.
  &ldquo;How&rsquo;n hell would a fellar ever get close enough to thet dame to
  dance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he shore couldn&rsquo;t hug her in thet outfit. More&rsquo;n
  likely he&rsquo;d tangle his feet,&rdquo; replied the other, with a chuckle.
  &ldquo;So I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to try.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These remarks caused Rock to take a second glance at the entering party.
  The girl in simple white was too small of stature to be Thiry; and her
  companion was too gorgeously arrayed. Nor did the third young lady inspire
  Rock with any thrilling interest.</p>

  <p>It struck him that the girl in the wedding-gown was certainly worth
  looking at. At first she did not appear to be masked at all, but as she drew
  closer he saw that she wore a close-fitting mask, scarcely any whiter than
  her powdered face. Her hair was done up in some amazing style and as
  colorless as snow. Arms and neck, of exquisite contour, likewise were of a
  dazzling whiteness. The gown, one of those hoop-skirted, many-ruffled affairs
  Rock had seen in pictures, took up the space of three ordinarily dressed
  women. Indeed, there appeared scarcely space enough for the girl to pass
  him.</p>

  <p>Trueman flattened himself against the wall, as he had observed the two
  cowboys do. Nevertheless, the young lady so marvelously gowned was forced to
  sweep her skirts aside to avoid contact. She came on. Rock could not
  determine whether or not her face was beautiful, but he certainly imagined it
  was. The momentary halting of the party, evidently to choose a direction,
  brought this Colonial masquerader so close to Rock that he meant to step
  forward and allow her more room. But she seemed to be looking at him, though
  her eyes were hardly discernable. He felt suddenly rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gurls, you shore passed the dressin&rsquo;-room,&rdquo; remarked
  one of the youths.</p>

  <p>They turned, some of them laughing, and the wonderful girl in white
  pressed close to Rock in passing, still apparently gazing at him. As the
  soft, fluffy, perfumed gown swept him, Rock felt a hand touch his&mdash;slip
  a folded paper into his palm with quick pressure. Then she passed and he
  leaned there staring. She vanished with the others.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s trembling fingers tightened on the paper. It was a note. That
  girl had been Thiry. In one glance she had pierced his disguise. And he had
  been far indeed from returning the compliment. What a joke on him! His
  vaunted perspicacity, his vain sense of a lover&rsquo;s assurance, went into
  eclipse. And in its place shot a thrill at her cleverness, her superb
  masquerade. Swift on that followed a shock at the significance of her action.
  Coming down to earth with a jerk, Rock peered into his palm at the note, then
  rushed off to find a light by which he could read it. All the swinging lights
  were Chinese lanterns and those stationary on the walls were dimmed by
  colored paper. Finally he found one under which he thought he could discern
  the writing, and here, after a keen glance around, he opened the note.</p>
  <BR>

  <p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">DEAR TRUEMAN</SPAN></p>

  <p class="letter">I will know you the instant I lay eyes on you. Will you me? I am in
  terrible fear, but I will come to the dance, cost what it may.</p>

  <p class="letter">Ash is in town, hiding. I do not know what he means. It may be there is
  some other reason for his action. Allie and I will go to the Farrells&rsquo;
  to dress, and come with their crowd.</p>

  <p class="letter">Ash never saw my great-grandmother&rsquo;s wedding-dress. He won&rsquo;t
  recognize me, when he comes. <u>For he will come!</u> You must keep close
  watch over me, else I would not dare take the risk. He is capable of
  stripping me before the crowd. I will dance with the Farrell boys a
  little&mdash;the rest with you. I shall not stay till they unmask. I want to
  go before he knows me. You must take me away before that.</p>

  <p class="letter">It may be madness. But I let my heart become set on this one dance. I grow
  furious at the thought of giving it up. I don&rsquo;t know myself of late. I
  <i>will</i> come&mdash;if only to&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">THIRY</SPAN>.</p>
  <BR>

  <p>Rock did not draw a breath during his swift perusal of this note. Then he
  gasped&mdash;and devoured it again. Though he could not believe he was awake
  the words were there, on white paper, in ink, clear and firm, in even,
  beautiful script.</p>

  <p>What did they betray? He could not subdue his pounding heart, but he
  strangled the leaping, whirling, rapturous thoughts. Her letter betrayed
  terror, yet a woman&rsquo;s willful longing for a little freedom, a little
  joy of youth. She asked his protection. Thiry Preston&mdash;who not long
  before had begged him to leave her! When Rock read again the sentence in
  which she confessed that Ash was capable of stripping her before the crowd,
  in his sudden realization of its content he froze in deadly fury. But it
  shook him and passed with the realization that she had promised to dance
  mostly with him. Lastly she did not know herself. She would come, if only
  to&mdash;&mdash;To what! Rock stormed at his insane hopes. This girl was
  admitting him into sweet and heart-lifting intimacy, but he must not be wild
  in his judgments. Why was she going to come? If only to&mdash;outwit Ash
  Preston once in her life! If only to&mdash;have a little of the pleasure she
  had been weak enough to dream of&mdash;that all girls yearned for! If only
  to&mdash;see how true had been Amy Dabb&rsquo;s confidences! If only
  to&mdash;confound her awakening heart with the shamelessness of a man! If
  only to&mdash;yield to irresistible temptation to see if Trueman Rock was the
  lover of Amy Dabb! Any one and all of these intentions might have been in
  Thiry&rsquo;s mind while she penned that impulsive, poignant letter.</p>

  <p>Rock placed the note inside his vest and strode back toward the corridor,
  his breast throbbing, his head high, his step buoyant, his nerves
  vibrant.</p>

  <p>As he entered the corridor, Thiry came out of a door halfway down and
  seemed to float toward him. They met, both aware of others present. Rock,
  removing his hat, made her an elaborate bow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady from Virginia, I salute you,&rdquo; he said gallantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Knight of the Card Table,&rdquo; she replied, and offered her
  hand.</p>

  <p>Rock clasped it and kissed it with the old-fashioned courtesy due the
  character she personified. But they acted no more. She seemed silently
  confused as he led her to the <i>patio</i>. There in the subdued glow of the
  lanterns they were comparatively alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry! You paralyzed me,&rdquo; he said, at length. &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t know you. I didn&rsquo;t <i>know</i> you.... And, oh, how lovely
  you look!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She murmured her thanks. They stood under an archway beside the fountain.
  The falling water tinkled in harmony with the soft strains of music. For them
  it was neither the place nor the time for calmness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How ever did you know me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I just did,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was the way you stood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon that makes me awful happy&mdash;an&rsquo; fearful, too,
  Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&mdash;You have little to be fearful about. But
  I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. If I ever had eyes I&rsquo;ll use them tonight.
  I&rsquo;ll let no insult, no humiliation touch you.... Thiry, where&rsquo;d
  you get that gorgeous gown?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was my great-grandmother&rsquo;s wedding-dress. We are from
  Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Virginia? Your father told me Missouri.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, after the war. I was little then. The war ruined us and we
  moved to Missouri.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!... Thiry, I always wondered about you. Was Preston a
  rebel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All Prestons were rebels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, as far as a child could understand. But those days and
  influences are past forever, thank God.... Ash is the only one of us who is
  still a rebel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine feathers make fine birds,&rdquo; rejoined Rock. &ldquo;You
  were always pretty to look at, in anythin&rsquo;. But now
  you&rsquo;re&mdash;oh!&mdash;beyond the poor compliments&mdash;and hopes,
  too, I reckon, of a range-rider.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like me, Trueman, but don&rsquo;t rub it
  in,&rdquo; she said, naïvely. &ldquo;In a few days I&rsquo;ll bake bread and
  milk the cows again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all the better for that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The music ceased and the gay dancers poured out of the hall to promenade
  in couples and quartettes and crowds, all intent, it appeared, to peep under
  masks and find one another out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My brothers&mdash;the twins and Al&mdash;and the Farrell boys know
  me, of course,&rdquo; said Thiry, as if remembering where she was. &ldquo;We
  must find them. Then after a few dances I&rsquo;ll be free&mdash;if&mdash;if
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, there&rsquo;s no if&mdash;now or ever,&rdquo; he replied,
  unsteadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you dance while I dance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll watch you&mdash;and see if anyone else is
  watchin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but surely you must <i>want</i> to dance some?&rdquo; she
  queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Amy Dabb?&rdquo; she flashed, with odd inflection of voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Amy Dabb,&rdquo; he said, turning to find her face averted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Trueman, she is your hostess. If I remember correctly, she
  meant to embody the duty of all her masculine guests in <i>your</i>
  attendance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; replied Rock, a little nettled at her satire.
  &ldquo;You mean she gave you a hunch I&rsquo;d dance all <i>my</i> dances
  with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something or other like that,&rdquo; murmured Thiry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon she was just talkin&rsquo;. She was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then <i>I</i> was wrong to believe her. Forgive me.... But I
  didn&rsquo;t see how you could be so&mdash;so&mdash;such a liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, I couldn&rsquo;t lie to you,&rdquo; he returned, with low
  voice ringing. &ldquo;Save me agony by believin&rsquo; that now. For some day
  you&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you must dance with your hostess&mdash;at least once,&rdquo;
  said Thiry, hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once.&mdash;Would you stand for it once?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>I!</i>... Stand for it? I fear you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get proud. I
  might stand it out at the Pass. But not here, with you in that dress.... I
  mean, straight out&mdash;do you <i>want</i> me to dance with you instead of
  Amy Dabb?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she returned, hotly. &ldquo;She hurt me. She said
  catty things all in a nice way. She offered to lend me a dress. She made me
  feel a&mdash;a country bumpkin.... I told you before what she hinted about
  you. It&rsquo;s selfish, little, miserable of me to want to show
  her.&mdash;But she made me almost hate her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, my obligation is paid,&rdquo; replied Rock, trying to
  contain himself. &ldquo;I have had that one dance with Mrs. Dabb. She met me.
  I didn&rsquo;t recognize her until she made herself known. It&rsquo;s over.
  So there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to dance with Allie,&rdquo; returned Thiry,
  shyly. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t tell on you. For that matter, it&rsquo;d be
  fun, if we can fool her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. Let&rsquo;s find her and your friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">THIRY had introduced Rock to her sister Alice as Señor Del
  Toro of Las Vegas. And Rock felt that so far as dancing was concerned he had
  acquitted himself creditably. But his stock of Spanish words was much more
  limited than Alice&rsquo;s, which, now that the dance had ended, began to be
  embarrassingly manifest.</p>

  <p>He had enjoyed this dance with Alice more even than the one with Amy Dabb.
  Alice was like a fairy on her feet and Rock could not have forced her out of
  step if he had tried. And as for dancing, this time he put his mind on it,
  endeavoring to do it well. He was thinking, perhaps, of the dances with Thiry
  so perilously close.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Señor, hadn&rsquo;t we better talk English?&rdquo; inquired Alice,
  mischievously.</p>

  <p>They were sitting in one of the corner bowers of the <i>patio</i>, a place
  Rock had spied out and which he thought would not be known to many. His idea
  was to get Thiry there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, señorita. I thought you were Spanish, too. I speak
  English,&rdquo; replied Rock, disguising his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve heard you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed? Where, may I inquire?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At my home&mdash;Sunset Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I have had the honor of being at your home? Sunset Pass? I
  don&rsquo;t recall it. But I&rsquo;ve been asked to so many
  <i>haciendas</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Alice laughed merrily. &ldquo;You look very grand as a Spanish gambler,
  but you&rsquo;re really one of my Dad&rsquo;s cowpunchers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alice Preston! You smart little rascal!&rdquo; ejaculated Rock,
  greatly amused. &ldquo;Then we didn&rsquo;t fool you at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you did! I was taken in, all right, and I was thrilled to
  death. But I grew suspicious before the dance was over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sure it was fun. I&rsquo;m glad you discovered me, for now I
  can talk.... Allie, doesn&rsquo;t Thiry look just gorgeous?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s lovely. You&rsquo;d hardly know her. Thiry carries
  this sort of thing off beautifully. Her masquerade is the finest here,
  don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I know, Allie. She&rsquo;s got them beaten a mile. But you
  look pretty sweet yourself. I&rsquo;d choose you about next, if I was a
  judge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. You&rsquo;re a cowboy, all right.... But about
  Thiry&mdash;I almost wish she had not come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Rock, anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s worried half to death. She&rsquo;s game, and only I who
  know her would even guess it. She&rsquo;s afraid Ash will come here and
  discover her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Allie, doesn&rsquo;t Thiry sort of overdo it? Isn&rsquo;t she
  oversensitive? Sure Ash can&rsquo;t do very much mischief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Ash,&rdquo; returned Alice, concisely.
  &ldquo;If he catches her in that dress he&rsquo;ll ruin it. Ash hates to see
  Thiry make herself so beautiful. I remember when I was a kid, how Ash used to
  rave if Thiry fixed herself up for a party. If he recognizes her
  here&mdash;good-by to great-grandmother&rsquo;s wedding-gown. It took two
  hours for Thiry to coax mother to lend her that gown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By George! I can&rsquo;t understand it, Allie!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Rock, in low anger, clinching his hands. &ldquo;Why, Allie, to spoil that
  gown would be vile!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d do it. But Thiry hopes to fool him. You must help,
  somehow, Mr. Rock.... My sister doesn&rsquo;t say a word, but I guess you had
  more than a little to do with her wanting to come so bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe that,&rdquo; replied Rock, slowly.
  &ldquo;You know she refused to marry me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad told us. But, goodness, Mr. Rock&mdash;think how sudden
  you were! What could you expect?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I deserve that. I didn&rsquo;t expect more than I got,&rdquo;
  went on Rock, eloquently, and then he bent his head close to the
  girl&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Allie, can I trust you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course you can!&rdquo; she rejoined, manifestly
  thrilled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to know what meetin&rsquo; Thiry has done for
  me. I used to be a pretty tough cowboy, they tell me. But I can never be
  again what I was. I will never care for any other girl&mdash;no matter what
  Thiry does to me. I just worship her. To say I love her isn&rsquo;t enough.
  Please don&rsquo;t think this just the ravin&rsquo; of a wild cowboy.
  I&rsquo;m no boy any more, Allie. I&rsquo;m thirty-two, old enough to know my
  mind, don&rsquo;t you think?... Well, I&rsquo;m beggin&rsquo; you to trust
  me, to believe in me, and to be my friend. I&rsquo;ll give my word
  you&rsquo;ll never, never be sorry.... When we get back to Sunset Pass
  I&rsquo;ll not distress Thiry, I&rsquo;ll content myself findin&rsquo; some
  way to serve her, and all of you. I&rsquo;ll keep away from her, if that is
  possible for me, while Ash is there.... Will you stand by me,
  Allie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet I will,&rdquo; she replied, with surprising vehemence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That makes me your friend for life,&rdquo; said Rock,
  feelingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry is unhappy, not like her old self. It&rsquo;s the way Ash
  nags her. Why, she can&rsquo;t call her soul her own. I get so furious.
  <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t stand it. But Thiry loves Ash as much as I hate
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allie, don&rsquo;t say that. He&rsquo;s your brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he is. I ought to be ashamed. But I&rsquo;m
  not. I never <i>felt</i> like his sister. And you can bet he never treated me
  as if I were.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There goes the music,&rdquo; replied Rock, and he arose.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you back to the hall.... Allie, our dance was fine.
  And I just couldn&rsquo;t say how much our talk means to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman Rock, I can&rsquo;t help but like you,&rdquo; she said,
  with a serious abruptness that reminded him of Thiry. Rock divined from her
  words and look that he had been on trial. Then at the door of the hall she
  squeezed his arm and left him.</p>

  <p>Rock became all eyes then. He was no longer a masquerader, nor a lovelorn
  shadow of his lady. He shifted in one moment to the cool, searching cowboy on
  a trail. His searching gaze was concerned with the masculine element of that
  gay crowd. If Ash Preston was there, Rock determined to locate him. It seemed
  extremely unlikely that Ash would mask and dance in order to spy upon Thiry,
  but Rock, believing the fellow was capable of anything, had to satisfy
  himself. He lounged around the door of the hall during two dances before he
  convinced himself that Ash was not among the cowboys dancing. Then he
  strolled down one long aisle and up the other, peering at every man and into
  every shadow. Likewise he searched the <i>patio</i>. Then he went into the
  corridor and toward the entrance, where the deputy and his sheriffs still
  held forth, faithful to the duty imposed upon them. When Ash Preston came in
  he would have to be masked and he could not hide a gun from those laconic
  Westerners. This afforded Rock relief. Returning to his post just inside the
  dance-hall door, he took up his vigil there.</p>

  <p>Another dance had just started. The big hall was a wonderful spectacle of
  movement, color, youth, beauty, and humor, for some of the cowboys were
  enough to make anyone laugh. They were growing noisy, too, but it was only
  hilarious fun. Rock did not see an objectionable thing. Certainly there had
  never been such a dance before in that country. They were making the most of
  it, and Rock, in his mind&rsquo;s eye, could see them telling around the camp
  fires of the future the story of that wonderful affair.</p>

  <p>Then he espied Thiry, conspicuous in white and notable for her grace. She
  was dancing with one of the lanky youths with whom she and Alice had come.
  Either he was a capital dancer or inspired by his partner. As they came
  around in the gliding circle she espied Rock over her partner&rsquo;s arm.
  What a smile she gave Rock! It made his heart beat faster. She appeared
  flushed under the white mask and powder. No doubt of her enjoyment! Probably
  for the hour she had forgotten the menace of Ash Preston. Soon that dance
  ended, and as the laughing throng pressed in a stream out the door, some
  one&mdash;a woman&mdash;thrust her face close under Rock&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; she whispered, and went on. The wine-dark hot eyes,
  through the red mask, the gold-and-black Spanish gown, so striking on the
  slender figure, belonged to Amy Dabb.</p>

  <p>Trueman whistled to keep from swearing. He had actually forgotten Amy.
  Dance after dance had gone by, and he had never even seen her. But suppose he
  had! His dismay was short-lived, in that he looked around from the
  disappearing Amy to see Thiry close at hand, coming alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Señor del Toro, you look lonesome,&rdquo; she said, gayly.
  &ldquo;Are there no charming señoritas here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can see only one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not danced?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once, with Allie. Sure she is a bird.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you enjoyed it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful! And the little minx soon saw through my
  disguise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come. The rest is yours,&rdquo; she said, and took his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you enjoyed yourself?&rdquo; he asked, as they mingled with
  the merry masqueraders in the <i>patio</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so much! It has been such fun. And I remembered I loved to
  dance. Then the music, the costumes, the excitement&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t
  tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has anyone discovered you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only one I know of, Amy Dabb. She was quick to see through
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well. Did she say anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rather think so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Rock, intensely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She said: &lsquo;Hello, Thiry! You look great. But wedding-gowns
  don&rsquo;t always mean wedding-bells.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! That was sweet of Amy, now. She has a nasty tongue, as I
  well know.... Thiry, I reckon there&rsquo;s not a young man at this dance who
  wouldn&rsquo;t ring weddin&rsquo;-bells for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rash flattery, Trueman,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;There must be
  many. I know five boys who are madly in love with their prospective
  partners.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five?... You mean six!&rdquo; rejoined Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. There are Al and Tom and Hal, my brothers. Then the two Farrell
  boys. I don&rsquo;t know anyone else here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, I make number six,&rdquo; said Rock, and quickly looked
  away, too guilty to dare to see how she took his remark. She made no reply at
  all. In silence they went the rounds of the <i>patio</i>, then up one arched
  aisle and down another, back to the dancing-floor. The music blared out. From
  behind, the eager masqueraders pressed, and Rock found himself in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>Thiry looked up with inscrutable eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You broke your word. You make me remember,&rdquo; she said,
  reproachfully, as she gave way to his encircling arm.</p>

  <p>A pang shot through Rock, but he did not think it was remorse. The miracle
  that tore him was his possession of this lovely girl. She was in his arms.
  She yielded to, rather than resisted, the close embrace he could not have
  forsworn to save his life. Rock was vaguely aware of the swaying, gliding,
  circling dancers, the grotesque masks, the low roar of voices mingled with
  sliding feet, and the unavoidable contacts. But the enchantment was Thiry,
  whose grace equaled Alice&rsquo;s, whose clasping hands and slender form
  unconsciously belied her reproachful words. That dance was brief as a
  fleeting moment, but endless in its intangible mystery and joy.</p>

  <p>Again they strolled under the magic rose and purple of the dimming
  lanterns, and on to the secluded bower in the <i>patio</i>. Here the stars
  shone white and watchful through the foliage. Somewhere a guitar twanged low
  melody and a girl&rsquo;s sweet voice in Spanish accompanied it. The water
  tinkled off in the darkness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very&mdash;warm,&rdquo; murmured Thiry, as Rock leaned
  over her in the shadow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take off your mask,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, señor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Trueman took her hand in his. It was an almost instinctive action on his
  part. She made no attempt to withdraw it, greatly to his surprise and
  joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, you must take me home soon,&rdquo; she said, as if coming
  out of a spell. The time and the place, the languorous atmosphere of this
  Spanish edifice, which, though new, seemed old in beauty and romance, the
  music, the dancers, the youth had indeed called to Thiry Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, not now. Just one more dance,&rdquo; pleaded Rock.
  &ldquo;You said the rest were mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash will come any moment. I feel it&mdash;here,&rdquo; she
  whispered, her hand on her breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, he is not here now. I&rsquo;ve looked clear through every
  man in the outfit. Please risk it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;one more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But at the end of this dance she forgot again or could not resist the joy
  of the hour. Once more Rock led her to their shadowed corner, once more he
  held an unresisting hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take off your mask,&rdquo; he begged again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you put it back on&mdash;right?&rdquo; she replied, a little
  tremulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then she was unmasked under his worshiping eyes, under the dim rose light
  of the lantern above and the far, white, and knowing stars. Once she lifted
  her eyes to him&mdash;eyes that betrayed the spell of the moment&mdash;then
  no more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not talk, señor,&rdquo; she said, trying for
  conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can I?... I&rsquo;m holdin&rsquo; your hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so you are!&mdash;Well, let go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pull it away,&rdquo; he whispered, daringly.</p>

  <p>But she did not.</p>

  <p>Rock won her to stay one more dance, reveled in his power to persuade her,
  though his conscience flayed him. What risk he might incur for her! But he
  gambled with his happiness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, we must go now,&rdquo; she said, nervously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But don&rsquo;t you hate to?&rdquo; he returned,
  jealously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m too thankful for&mdash;for all it&rsquo;s
  been.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, you are warm. We must get somethin&rsquo; to throw over your
  shoulders when we go out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a shawl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They reached the <i>patio</i>. Something had happened, as Rock guessed
  from excited voices. A girl cried out in dismay.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, look out there!&rdquo; called some one, unmistakably a
  cowboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He snatched at my mask,&rdquo; replied a girl, angrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He got mine,&rdquo; added another woman, shrilly. &ldquo;The mean
  thing. That&rsquo;s no fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock drew Thiry to the right, out of the press.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some cowboy snatchin&rsquo; masks,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly into the open space before him leaped a lithe figure of a cowboy,
  wearing a red handkerchief as a mask. He was as quick as light&mdash;so quick
  that Rock scarcely guessed his purpose in time to thwart it. But Rock was on
  the wrong side of Thiry. One sweep of hand tore Thiry&rsquo;s mask from her
  white face! She cried out and spasmodically clutched Rock&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>The cowboy appeared to leap up. He snatched off the red handkerchief that
  masked him, to disclose the livid face of Ash Preston. His evil eyes, like
  coals of blue fire, flashed over her face, her bare neck and arms, her
  spreading ruffled gown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash,&rdquo; gasped Thiry, clutching Rock&rsquo;s arm tighter,
  &ldquo;meet Señor del Toro&mdash;my masquerade partner!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Señor &rsquo;ell!&rdquo; he bit out, incredibly cold and fierce.
  Like a snake&rsquo;s head his hand shot out, to fasten in Thiry&rsquo;s
  bodice and tear with fiendish swiftness.</p>

  <p>In one single action Rock freed himself from Thiry and struck Preston on
  the side of the face. He went down with a thud. Women screamed; men shouted
  excitedly; and all spread back hurriedly. Up bounded Preston, with catlike
  quickness, his hand flashing back for his gun. But it was not there. He had
  passed the sheriff and had forgotten. If it were possible his wolfish face
  gleamed fiercer. His tawny hair stood up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Greaser, I&rsquo;ll kill you for thet!&rdquo; he ground out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Carramba!</i>&rdquo; replied Rock, and made at Preston with
  terrific fury. His onslaught was like a battering-ram. He cared nothing for
  Preston&rsquo;s sudden blows. He broke through them, beat him back, and
  knocked him against the wall. Ash fell, but got up cursing, to come back
  wilder than ever, his face the redder for blood. There was a swift
  interchange of blows, then one from Rock staggered Preston. Another swift and
  hard, hitting solid like an ax on beef, sent Preston in a long fall. Before
  he could rise Rock plunged upon him, beat him with right, left, right,
  left&mdash;tremendous blows that made Ash sink limp. Rock seized him by the
  neck, choked and shook him as a terrier with a rat, and rising, dragged him
  to the fountain and threw him bodily into the shallow water. Ash lay on his
  back, his head just above the surface, and though still conscious he did not
  have strength to get up.</p>

  <p>Rock, remembering his mask, felt for it and found it intact. That helped
  release him from the grip of an awful anger. Thiry&rsquo;s white mask lay
  where Preston had dropped it. Snatching it up, Rock whirled to see some woman
  in the act of covering Thiry&rsquo;s naked shoulders and bosom with a
  shawl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;we&rsquo;ll&mdash;get out&mdash;of here,&rdquo; he
  panted, hoarsely, and placing a firm hand under her arm he led her away from
  the gaping crowd, down the corridor toward the outlet. The voices of excited
  people grew fainter. Rock halted long enough to produce his check and get his
  gun-belt, which he threw over his left arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up in thar?&rdquo; queried the sheriff, sharply eying
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some fool cowboy snatchin&rsquo; masks off the ladies,&rdquo;
  replied Rock, and hurried Thiry out, through the crowd of Mexicans, to the
  street and darkness.</p>

  <p>Thiry was weak. She leaned on his arm. Still she kept up with his rapid
  steps. Not for three blocks did Rock speak, nor did she.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; she burst out, then.
  &ldquo;Called you greaser!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the only good thing about it,&rdquo; returned
  Rock, stirring to recover under such pressure as he had never experienced. He
  was wringing wet with cold sweat and quivering in all his muscles. A knot of
  fire within seemed to be loosening. His mouth was dry, his tongue thick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God! What shame&mdash;what disgrace&mdash;distress I&rsquo;ve
  brought on you!&rdquo; he muttered when he could speak.</p>

  <p>She was sobbing a little and clinging to the arm with which Rock upheld
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He tore my waist&mdash;almost off. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind the shame
  of that&mdash;so much. But the gown mother treasured. She loved it so....
  She&rsquo;ll be heartbroken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a dress?&mdash;That can be&mdash;mended,&rdquo; he
  panted. &ldquo;But I kept you there. Too long! It was my&mdash;fault&mdash;my
  fault.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was to blame, too,&rdquo; she said, loyally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I had only left when you wanted to go!&rdquo; he returned,
  fiercely. &ldquo;After my promise to you! God! what luck I have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone. I knew something dreadful
  would happen. I <i>told</i> you.... Only he was worse than I ever saw
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worse!&mdash;He was a hydrophobia skunk!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Ash!... My brother!&rdquo; she cried, brokenly.</p>

  <p>Her grief tortured Rock, but he did not have it in him to retract his
  words. What language could do justice to Ash Preston! They hurried on, to the
  edge of town, down the pine-skirted road. The night was starry, almost cool,
  and the wind moved through the tree-tops. Presently they reached
  Winter&rsquo;s house, which sat back among the trees. Rock saw a light. He
  wanted to say good night to Thiry at the gate, but could not. She still clung
  to him. At the porch he halted, and helped her up. It was shaded there by
  trees, but he could still see her pale face and the great eyes, strange and
  dark in the night. Before he knew what he was doing he clasped his arms round
  her, as she stood a little above him. She did not repulse him, but she
  pressed her hands against his shoulders. Thus they looked at each other in
  the shadow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Thiry,&rdquo; he implored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to my room before anyone sees me. Ash didn&rsquo;t
  know me. He never will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> will tell,&rdquo; said Thiry, hopelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who? Allie? Oh no. She&rsquo;ll be as true as steel,&rdquo; he
  declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Allie. I mean that jealous woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amy Dabb!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, with a start. &ldquo;She did know.
  But she&rsquo;ll have no chance tonight. Reckon your noble brother
  couldn&rsquo;t hear if she tried to tell him. But they&rsquo;ll pack him out
  of there pronto. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll find some way to shut her
  mouth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; said Thiry, with sad derision.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your breath, Trueman. Don&rsquo;t ask her. Perhaps
  it will not occur to her that Ash didn&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hope for the best... that I won&rsquo;t have to
  run away to avoid a real fight with Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Real! I&rsquo;d like to know what you&rsquo;d call what you had.
  But it was one-sided. Scared as I was, I saw that.... Trueman, you were
  wonderful. Oh, if it had not been my brother!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He deserved it, Thiry,&rdquo; returned Rock, passionately.
  &ldquo;Admit that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You beat him terribly. It&mdash;hurt me&mdash;so.... But, oh, he
  did deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock tightened his arms a little, drew her closer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, kiss me good night,&rdquo; he whispered, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and tried to draw away. But he held
  her, and as she turned her face he managed to kiss her cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

  <p>What he had done she did not say, but she ceased to pull away. That
  emboldened him. Still he drew back the better to see her averted face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s one more offense?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  ruined my hopes tonight&mdash;or I have found them glorified.... Oh,
  Thiry&mdash;how I love you!... Kiss me good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Yet she seemed weakening. He felt her quiver in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let me kiss you?... It might be the first and last time. For
  if Ash finds me out I&rsquo;ll have to leave this country. Else I&rsquo;d
  have to kill him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d go away for me?&rdquo; she flashed, suddenly quickened
  and revivified, and her hands went to his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I promise you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You love me so much?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry girl, I love you more than I can prove.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blindly, with unreckoning impulse, she bent and met his upturned lips with
  her own. Quickly, with a gasp, she broke away to stare a moment, as if some
  realization had stricken her, then she fled across the porch and into the
  house.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Ash Preston did not return to Sunset Pass for a week after the Fourth.
  Rumor drifted down by a rider that Preston was hunting for the Mexican who
  had beaten him at the dance.</p>

  <p>It was an anxious and brooding time for Trueman Rock, more, perhaps,
  because of Thiry&rsquo;s unconcealed dread than for his own sake.
  Nevertheless, he never drew an easy breath, despite the rumor, until Ash
  returned, sober yet showing the effects of a prolonged debauch. One moment
  Rock stood on the porch, his hand quivering, while Ash strode over from his
  cabin. Sullen, his face black and blue, still swollen, he presented no
  encouraging aspect. But manifestly that moment proved he did not know or
  suspect Rock had been his assailant. Then the suspense of this meeting for
  Rock ended when Thiry almost fainted in Ash&rsquo;s arms. Not improbably her
  relief was so great that she succumbed under it. Certainly, however, no one
  save Rock took it that way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Thiry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; rasped out Ash, while he held
  her on the bench. Tears were streaming down his bruised cheeks. &ldquo;I was
  drunk thet night.... I&rsquo;ll never go to town no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How utterly incongruous his repentance seemed to Rock! Pity could not
  abide in Rock&rsquo;s heart&mdash;not for this man.</p>

  <p>This had happened in the middle of the afternoon, upon Ash&rsquo;s arrival
  home. Gage Preston was absent. It was Rock&rsquo;s opinion that Gage did not
  care to be present when Ash met Thiry and Rock. A maddening flash of thought
  came to Rock, following the collapse of his reinforced nerve. This issue had
  only been postponed! All the anxious speculation, the worry wearing into
  dread, the sickening realization that Thiry was growing strained, pale, the
  waiting suspense, and then this sudden release&mdash;all these in vain!</p>

  <p>Yet, even a respite, considering Thiry, was something blessed, and for
  which he gave profound thanks. Supper that night no longer seemed something
  like a funeral feast. Gage Preston came in late, and his gruff heartiness,
  his steely glance, embracing Ash and Thiry and Rock, were strangely at
  variance. Rock felt that after a short absence, in which incalculable changes
  had taken place, he was about to see a new phase in Preston&rsquo;s complex
  character.</p>

  <p>Rock did not tarry with the family. He carried away with him a look from
  Thiry&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;the first in which she had met his since that
  unforgettable last moment on Winter&rsquo;s porch&mdash;and it drove him to
  pace under the pines, to throw back his head, to fill his lungs with the
  sage-laden air of the Pass, to cast exultant defiance up at the silent,
  passionless white stars.</p>

  <p>He paced a beat from the open back to the gloom of the thick-spreading
  trees. On the soft mats of pine needles his feet made no sound; against the
  black shadow of the slope his figure could not be seen. But his own sharp eye
  caught a dark form crossing in front of a cabin light. He heard a voice low
  but clear&mdash;Gage Preston&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Ash, come hyar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then two dark forms made black upright bars, to obliterate the light, then
  passed on. Rock watched, crouching to peer through the gloom. Suddenly he
  made them out, perilously close upon him. Silently he sank behind the log by
  which he had crouched, immensely glad that it lay between him and the
  approaching men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; growled Ash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so loud, you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; replied Preston, in low harsh tones. &ldquo;I want to
  talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t in no humor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; ordered Preston, with heavy contact of hand
  upon his son&rsquo;s person.</p>

  <p>Rock felt the jar of the log where evidently Preston had pushed Ash.
  Noiselessly craning his neck, Rock saw the dim figure of the father, bending
  over. Then Rock espied Ash sitting not ten feet from where he lay. It seemed
  to Rock that cold blood oozed from his very marrow. If caught there he would
  have to fight for his life. Almost he ceased to breathe. The pounding of his
  heart sounded like a muffled drum.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s got into you?&rdquo; demanded Ash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s got into <i>you</i>&mdash;thet you hang on in
  town, lookin&rsquo; for trouble, makin&rsquo; more fer me?&rdquo; countered
  the father, sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some greaser punched me, an&rsquo; I stayed to find him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Punched you! Aw, why don&rsquo;t you be game? He beat you till you
  were senseless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, if you knowed it why&rsquo;n hell bother me? It
  don&rsquo;t make me cheerful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I needed you hyar,&rdquo; replied Preston, trying to stifle
  rage that would not down. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s work no one else can
  do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Pa, I wanted to kill thet Señor del Toro,&rdquo; protested
  Ash, almost plaintively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah! Señor del Toro? Why, you lunkhead, thet make-believe Spaniard
  was Trueman Rock!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell, no!&rdquo; snapped Ash, hotly. &ldquo;I had thet hunch. But I
  was wrong. Next mornin&rsquo; I went to Thiry. I told her thet black-masked
  pardner of hers was Rock an&rsquo; I was a-goin&rsquo; to kill him. She fell
  on her knees. An&rsquo; she wrapped her arms around me. An&rsquo; she swore
  to God it wasn&rsquo;t Rock.... Pa, I had to believe her. Thiry never lied in
  her life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mebbe I&rsquo;m wrong,&rdquo; choked Preston, as if a will not his
  own wrenched that admission from him. &ldquo;But whoever he was he gave you
  plumb what I&rsquo;d have given you. Everybody says so. Wade Simpson told me.
  An&rsquo; Slagle said it only today.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh? Wal, two more fer bullet holes,&rdquo; drawled the son, in
  deadly menace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talk sense,&rdquo; fumed Preston. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shore
  gettin&rsquo; leary about you. Man alive, you can&rsquo;t shoot everybody on
  the range. An&rsquo; haven&rsquo;t you any decency? To rip Thiry&rsquo;s
  dress half off before a crowd. Why, you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, Pa, I was drunk. When I seen Thiry with her shoulders an&rsquo;
  bosom all bare&mdash;before them men&mdash;I said by God she&rsquo;d stand
  naked before them an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drunk?&mdash;Man, you were crazy,&rdquo; retorted the father,
  hoarsely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never live thet down. But thet&rsquo;s
  nothin&rsquo; for you to care about. The thing is you disgraced Thiry. You
  shamed her. You hurt her so she&rsquo;s been ill. She&mdash;who&rsquo;s loved
  you all her life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shet up, Pa,&rdquo; wailed Ash, writhing. &ldquo;I can stand
  anythin&rsquo; but thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you shore have a queer streak in you. Yellow clear through
  when it comes to Thiry. But fer her you&rsquo;d be a man. An&rsquo; we could
  go on with our work thet&rsquo;s callin&rsquo; fer all a man&rsquo;s
  brains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it up to Thiry,&rdquo; returned Ash, hurriedly.
  &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll forgive me. I&rsquo;ll never do thet no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be relied upon, as you used to be,&rdquo; returned
  the rancher, bitterly. &ldquo;Now listen, somethin&rsquo;s up out there on
  the range. I&rsquo;ve done some scoutin&rsquo; around lately. I&rsquo;ve
  talked with the Mexican sheep-herders. Too many riders snoopin&rsquo; around
  Sunset Pass! Today I seen some of Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfit. An&rsquo; Slagle
  asked me sarcastic like why Clink Peeples was over hyar so much.... Ash,
  there&rsquo;s a nigger in the woodpile. I shore don&rsquo;t like the
  smell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clink Peeples had better keep away from the Pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There you go again. What good will it do to throw a gun on Peeples?
  If they&rsquo;re suspicious, thet&rsquo;d only make them worse....
  What&rsquo;d you do with them last Half Moon hides?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hid them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a good place, all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; you! Didn&rsquo;t you take them to Limestone Cave,
  as I ordered you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I packed some there. It was too far, an&rsquo; I was tuckered out.
  I hid the rest under the culvert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I told you not to hide any more there. I always was scared of
  thet culvert. Once a big rain washed some out. It could happen
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it ain&rsquo;t too late. I&rsquo;ll take Boots tomorrow night,
  an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll pack the fresh ones over to Limestone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. The ground&rsquo;s soft since it rained. You&rsquo;d leave
  tracks. An&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s too risky with these new riders
  searchin&rsquo; around. Better leave them. An&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll lay off
  butcherin&rsquo; fer a spell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lay off nothin&rsquo;. With all them orders fer beef? I guess not.
  Pa, there&rsquo;s room fer a thousand hides down in the old well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash, I tell you we&rsquo;ll lay off killin&rsquo; till this
  suspicion dies down,&rdquo; said Preston, in hoarse earnestness, fighting for
  patience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I won&rsquo;t lay off, an&rsquo; I reckon I can boss the
  boys,&rdquo; replied Ash, implacably.</p>

  <p>Then Preston cursed him, cursed him with every hard word known to the
  range, and some besides, cursed until he was spent from passion, when he fell
  heavily to a seat on the log.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This hyar rider, Rock,&rdquo; spoke up Ash, as if he had never
  heard the storm of profanity, &ldquo;when you goin&rsquo; to fire
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock? Not at all,&rdquo; replied Preston, wearily. He was
  beaten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, I will. He&rsquo;s been around too long, watchin&rsquo;
  Thiry, an&rsquo; mebbe us, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash, haven&rsquo;t you sense enough to see thet Rock&rsquo;s
  bein&rsquo; hyar is good fer us?&rdquo; asked Preston, girding himself
  afresh. &ldquo;Never was a rider hyar so trusted as Rock. Thet diverts
  suspicion from us. It was lucky he came.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he might find us out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t likely. Shore he doesn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He might stumble on to it by accident. Or get around Thiry
  an&rsquo; scare it out of her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if he <i>did</i>, thet wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. She could
  keep his mouth shut. He loves her well enough to come in with us. Only
  I&rsquo;d hate like hell to ask her to do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if she did win him over, what would <i>he</i>
  want?&rdquo; hissed Ash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh! Reckon thet&rsquo;s easy to answer. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  tellin&rsquo; you, Ash, Thiry would like Rock if she had half a
  chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A knife plunged into Ash&rsquo;s vitals could scarcely have made him bend
  double and rock to and fro, like that thrust of Preston&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d like him, huh? So thet&rsquo;s why she made me promise
  not to pick a fight with him.... Hell&rsquo;s fire!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Ash, if circumstances come up we can&rsquo;t help or beat,
  what&rsquo;n hell can we do? I told you ages ago thet Thiry is bound some day
  to love some lucky rider. It can&rsquo;t be helped. An&rsquo; it might be
  Rock. Which&rsquo;d be most infernal lucky fer us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lucky fer him! Haw! Haw!&mdash;I&rsquo;d shoot his heart
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston rose to loom darkly, menacingly over his son.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t murder him in his sleep, or shoot him in the back.
  Thet&rsquo;d look bad in Wagontongue. It&rsquo;d just about ruin us.
  An&rsquo; if you call him out to an even break&mdash;why, Ash, he&rsquo;ll
  kill you! Savvy? You shore ought to be keen enough to see it. Rock is cold as
  ice, as quick as lightnin&rsquo;. He has a hawk eye. I&rsquo;m warnin&rsquo;
  you, Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The son leaped up as if sprung. &ldquo;So help me Gawd! You&rsquo;re
  tryin&rsquo; awful hard to keep us apart. Haw! Haw!... No, Pa, I don&rsquo;t
  savvy you!&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">LONG after the Prestons stalked away Rock lay behind the
  log, thinking over the peril he had been in and the revelation that had
  accompanied it.</p>

  <p>Late he stole like an Indian to his cabin, made his bed inside, and
  barring the door, lay down just as he was. Sleep was neither desirable nor
  possible. The certainty of the Prestons&rsquo; guilt was not the staggering
  detail of that disclosure. Rock pinned down some grim facts.</p>

  <p>Thiry had lied to deceive Ash as to her escort at the dance. Ash did not
  know then, but sooner or later he would find out. There was more suspicion
  directed toward the Prestons than Rock had known. The case was growing
  critical. Gage Preston knew it. He wanted to avert catastrophe; but for this
  vicious son he not improbably could have done so. But Ash Preston dominated
  father and brothers. He would ride to his doom. Rock had met many of that
  Western type, and every single one of them had died with his boots on.</p>

  <p>Preston had told his son that Señor del Toro was Rock. Here Rock had an
  icy, sickening portent&mdash;one which he had been on the verge of
  before&mdash;Preston wanted to force a fight between him and Ash. He knew
  that Rock would kill his son. There seemed no other possible interpretation.
  He had deliberately suggested they persuade Thiry to make Rock one of them.
  By fair means or foul! This betrayed Preston&rsquo;s extremity. Lastly the
  cunning Ash was growing suspicious of his father.</p>

  <p>Out of all this only calamity could come to Thiry, unless Rock by some
  means was able to avert it. He was at his wits&rsquo; end. He had never heard
  of such an overwhelming predicament as the one that now struck him to
  desperation. If he could only call Ash out and shoot him! But this would
  break Thiry&rsquo;s heart and make him an object of horror in her eyes. He
  simply could not do that&mdash;not to save Gage Preston from jail and Thiry
  from disgrace. At length, worn out by contending tides, he rolled over and
  went to sleep.</p>

  <p>In the morning he watched from his window until Ash left, then went out to
  breakfast. The children were there, gay and chattering as usual. Thiry did
  not appear. Preston came out while Rock was eating and said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I&rsquo;ve a job for you that&rsquo;ll take you away some
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. I need some real work,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ll find it that. The boys are gettin&rsquo; a pack
  outfit ready. They know where to go. I want five hundred head of two-year-old
  steers in the flat down there by Slagle&rsquo;s ranch. By August.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; protested Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With three half-grown cowpunchers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;ve been hollerin&rsquo; fer some real work. Pack
  an&rsquo; rustle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boss, Preston. But are you sure you won&rsquo;t
  need me more right here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston bent toward Rock and lowered his voice. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t what
  I&rsquo;d like or need. I had no idee last night thet I&rsquo;d send you off
  this mornin&rsquo;. But it popped into my head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh! Who popped it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry. She asked me to. Ash is wuss than ever before. An&rsquo; fer
  once Thiry seemed to be thinkin&rsquo; of somebody else but him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is she feelin&rsquo;, Preston?&rdquo; asked Rock,
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, she perked up when I told her I&rsquo;d send you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits me fine. Don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you, boss, that Ash
  is almost gettin&rsquo; on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! Almost gettin&rsquo;, hey? Wal, if you ain&rsquo;t made
  out of stone I&rsquo;ll eat my hat. My nerves <i>are</i> shot to
  pieces.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock got up and stepped over the bench, without looking at Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Small wonder, boss. Reckon you&rsquo;d do well to hawg-tie Ash
  an&rsquo; hang round the Pass for a month.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This speech had been the outcome of impressions Rock had received from
  Preston&rsquo;s manner and words. He spoke it curtly, with never a glance,
  then he walked away toward his cabin. It did not suit Rock just then to leave
  the Pass without a hint to Preston. He believed it would be interpreted that
  Wagontongue gossip had reached his ears and might be worth heeding. Let
  Preston ponder over that advice and see how far he got. This might pave the
  way to something deeper.</p>

  <p>Rock repaired to his cabin and rolled his bed and packed the things he
  would need. Several times during the process he went to the window to peer
  out. The clip-clop of hoofs drew him again. Ash and Boots Preston were riding
  by, headed east. Rock&rsquo;s quick eye noted saddle-bags, blankets, ropes.
  And he guessed that the contrary Ash meant to disobey his father and remove
  the fresh hides from the culvert to a better hiding-place.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ride on, you lean-jawed wolf!&rdquo; muttered Rock.</p>

  <p>When they were out of sight, Rock wavered between two strong
  desires&mdash;to see Thiry before he left and write to her. The better course
  would be to write, because he could put on paper what there would be no
  chance to speak. No sooner did he decide than he realized it was an
  opportunity not to be lost. Therefore, with lead pencil and paper he sat down
  to his little table and began, with hand that he could not keep steady and
  heart which accelerated a beat for every word.</p>

  <p>THIRY DARLING,</p>

  <p>Your Dad has ordered me away for several weeks, maybe more. I am glad to
  go, though not to see your sweet face for so long will be terrible. But I
  shall work like a beaver, and content myself with thinking of you by day and
  dreaming of you by night&mdash;with praying for your happiness and
  welfare.</p>

  <p>I want you to know this, so that while I&rsquo;m gone you may remember me
  often. My conscience flays me still for what I brought upon you at the dance.
  But I don&rsquo;t ask forgiveness for that so much as for what happened on
  Winter&rsquo;s porch. Still, if I had no more to sustain me, Thiry, through
  what seems to be the hardest trial of my life, that kiss you gave me would be
  enough. I know you meant only unheeding gratitude. But nevertheless you
  kissed me, and I can never be a rational being again.</p>

  <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Thiry dear, about Ash, or me, or whatever it is that is
  wrong. You can&rsquo;t help it. And it will not turn out so bad as you think.
  Nothing ever does. I believe that if you were to fall into some really
  dreadful trouble I could save you. Now what do you think of that for a
  fellow&rsquo;s faith in himself? Of course, by trouble, I mean something
  concerning Ash. I must not deceive you, dearest, your brother is the kind of
  range man that comes to a bad end. You must face this with courage. You must
  realize that he might involve your father, you, and all of your people in
  something through which you could suffer.</p>

  <p>It is no use to try to change Ash. You waste your strength. The more you
  do for him the less he will appreciate. I think you can only pray and hope
  for the best. You will have a good long rest from my disturbing presence,
  during which time you must think earnestly and fight for that endurance women
  of the West must have.</p>

  <p>My mother and sister tried the pioneer life for a while. It was too much
  for them. But you are of stronger stuff. Remember that Allie and Lucy must
  find their spirit in you.</p>

  <p>I shall think of you every sunset, and see you come out to watch the
  Pass.</p>

  <p>Ever TRUEMAN.</p>

  <p>Returning to the Preston cabin, Rock looked for Alice to deliver his note
  to Thiry, but as she was not there he ventured of his own accord. Slipping it
  under the door of Thiry&rsquo;s cabin, he beat a rather precipitate retreat.
  Nevertheless, he heard the door open, and turning saw Thiry pick up the
  missive, and then stand to look at him. It was too far away to see her
  expression. Rock waved his hand. Would she return his salute? She did not, to
  his dismay. Still he turned again and again to look over his shoulder as he
  hurried away. Finally she waved, then quickly shut the door. Rock&rsquo;s
  dismay was transformed to delight. She had his letter and she had waved
  good-by. He could not have asked or hoped for more. That would serve him well
  during his sojourn in the woods.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>In half an hour he sat astride Egypt, bound down the Pass. This trip would
  be a welcome respite, and from every angle favorable for him. Two hours later
  he was climbing the benches into the black timber, and late that afternoon he
  halted with the boys in a wild and sylvan spot to make a permanent camp.</p>

  <p>He had ridden along that babbling brown stream, but he could not recall
  the exact location. The huge pines shaded boulders covered with green moss;
  open forest stretched away on each side; the brook came rushing down from the
  higher country above; deer grazed with the cattle; wild horses trooped up to
  whistle and look, and then race away with manes flying. This was the edge of
  the mountain range where thirty thousand head of mixed brands roamed, wilder
  than the deer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, your dad has stuck us with a job he thinks we can&rsquo;t
  do,&rdquo; observed Rock, at the camp fire. &ldquo;Five hundred head of
  two-year-olds by August.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be did,&rdquo; replied Tom, throwing up his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By thunder! What&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; Dad these days?&rdquo;
  exclaimed Harry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fool him once,&rdquo; added Al, with spirit. &ldquo;For
  some reason or other he wants us holed up out here like a lot of gophers.
  There&rsquo;s another dance in town along early in August. An&rsquo; if
  you-all want a hunch&mdash;there&rsquo;s somebody who says I gotta be on
  hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, Al,&rdquo; said Rock. &ldquo;If we can find
  a canyon or draw somewhere close we&rsquo;ll drive what we round up each day,
  and fence them in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good big draw over here. Water an&rsquo; grass. Once been fenced
  in, but the poles are down. Reckon we could fix it up pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before they went to bed Rock had imbued the brothers with something of his
  own will to do or die. Next morning they were up in the dark, had the horses
  in at dawn, breakfast before sunrise, and on the drive when the first tinges
  of rose colored the rims of the Pass.</p>

  <p>It was another old story for Rock, though he had never herded cattle with
  such a horse as Egypt. This fact and the forest with its multiple aspects of
  wild beauty and lonesome solitude, and the oft-recurring memory of Thiry, so
  poignant and sweet, made the hours seem days and the days weeks.</p>

  <p>It rained every day, mostly summer showers, with rainbows bent from cloud
  to forest. The dry dusty brush grew green with renewed life; the pines and
  oaks were washed clean; the streams sang bank-full of amber water; the aspens
  began to take on a tinge of gold.</p>

  <p>One night Al got in latest of all, weary and sullen. Rock knew something
  untoward had happened, but he waited until the lad had eaten and rested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you run up on today, cowboy?&rdquo; queried Rock, at
  length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was up under the Notch,&rdquo; replied Al, &ldquo;an&rsquo; first
  thing I seen a couple of riders high up, watchin&rsquo; me. I didn&rsquo;t
  let on, an&rsquo; went on drivin&rsquo; same as if I hadn&rsquo;t seen them.
  Reckon they never lost sight of me all day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&rdquo; ejaculated Rock.</p>

  <p>The twins were silent, which fact did not argue for a favorable reception
  of this news.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See any brands except ours?&rdquo; asked Rock, pertinently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore did. Lot of Half Moon stock scattered all over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The devil you say. I thought Hesbitt ran the Half Moon outfit low
  down on the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We heard in town he was goin&rsquo; to change,&rdquo; replied
  Al.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any two-year-olds in that bunch?&rdquo; asked Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon most of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh! And how many of our brand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty scarce. I won&rsquo;t bother to drive there
  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Three days later, miles east of the Notch, Rock&rsquo;s alert eye caught
  sight of riders above him on a slope, keeping behind the trees, and no doubt
  spying upon him with a glass. Though boiling with rage, he went right on
  driving as if he were none the wiser. On the return to camp he came to the
  conclusion that one of Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfits was deliberately on the trail.
  This roused more than anger in Rock. The situation around Gage Preston was
  narrowing down critically. Rock thought it best not to acquaint the brothers
  with his discovery. They were doing wonderful driving, and soon the five
  hundred head would be all rounded up, ready to be moved down into the
  Pass.</p>

  <p>But a couple of days before this longed-for number had been herded into
  the canyon-corral, the thing Rock expected came to pass. Early in the
  morning, at breakfast hour, a group of riders, five in number, rode down upon
  the camp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, reckon I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; said Rock, gruffly.
  &ldquo;But you take it natural-like, and I&rsquo;ll do the
  talkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As the riders entered camp Rock rose from his seat beside the camp fire to
  greet the visitors. They were seasoned range-riders, a hard-looking quintet,
  not one of whom Rock had ever seen. They probably belonged to the Wyoming
  outfit which had come from the north with Hesbitt. It took no second glance
  for Rock to decide they did not know him by sight or reputation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy! Just in time for grub,&rdquo; he said, heartily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much obliged, but we had ourn,&rdquo; replied the leader, a
  bronzed, rugged cowman, with bright bold eyes that roved everywhere.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you must crawl out early mornin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; drawled Rock,
  going back to his seat and lifting plate and cup. &ldquo;Get down and stay
  awhile.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His invitation was not accepted nor acknowledged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gage Preston outfit?&rdquo; inquired the leader.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Part of it,&rdquo; replied Rock, not so cordially. He meant
  presently to show that he was thinking hard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Round-up or drivin&rsquo; a herd?&rdquo; went on the interlocutor,
  visibly cooler.</p>

  <p>Rock set down his plate, his cup, and slowly turned on his seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re drivin&rsquo; five hundred head of two-year-olds down
  the Pass. Reckon another day or so will make the full count,&rdquo; rejoined
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Big job for so few punchers. Anybody else with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where you got the herd bunched?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We fenced a canyon across the creek,&rdquo; returned Rock, pointing
  eastward.</p>

  <p>The leader was evidently finding Rock a man about whom he had begun to
  have uneasy conceptions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know the lay of the land,&rdquo; went on the leader.
  &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t rid long on this range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you didn&rsquo;t have to tell me that,&rdquo; replied Rock,
  bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from Wyomin&rsquo;, an ridin&rsquo; for
  Hesbitt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know thet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon nobody else would brace <i>me</i> this way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You?</i> Which one of the Prestons might you be? I&rsquo;ve seen
  Ash Preston out on the range, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re shore not
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might be any one of the other six Prestons,&rdquo; rejoined Rock,
  with dry sarcasm. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better hand over your
  callin&rsquo;-card before askin&rsquo; me to introduce myself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jim Dunne, foreman for Hesbitt,&rdquo; replied the
  rider.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. How do, Mr. Dunne? A blind cowboy could see your call
  isn&rsquo;t friendly. Now what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;ve come over to have a look at your herd,&rdquo;
  answered Dunne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!&rdquo; Rock, with suddenness, stood erect. He strode halfway
  across the camp space to confront Dunne. &ldquo;Just to see if by accident we
  didn&rsquo;t round up a couple of Half Moon steers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; about
  accidents,&rdquo; returned the other, no doubt stirred by Rock&rsquo;s
  caustic query.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne, you bet your life you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to look over our
  herd,&rdquo; snapped Rock. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll call you plumb
  straight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One of Dunne&rsquo;s men whispered to him, with visible effect.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, are you this fellar Rock?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Rock. Reckon that doesn&rsquo;t mean anythin&rsquo;
  to you. But maybe it will later.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I can&rsquo;t see as there&rsquo;s any reason to be
  riled,&rdquo; returned Dunne, shifting in his saddle, evidently now wanting
  to conciliate Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know this range,&rdquo; said
  Rock, curtly, and then turned to the Preston brothers. &ldquo;Boys,
  we&rsquo;ll drive the steers out of the canyon for inspection. We&rsquo;ll
  head them down into the Pass. Then we&rsquo;ll pack and go on in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock relentlessly held the Half Moon outfit on both sides of the corral
  gate while the cowboys drove the steers out in single file and in twos and
  threes. It was Rock&rsquo;s task to head them down toward the Pass, which was
  easy after the leaders got started.</p>

  <p>Dunne made several weak attempts to call off the inspection, but Rock
  rigorously held him and his men to a count of every steer that passed the
  gateway. It was a long, tedious job.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne, between you all you&rsquo;ve seen every head of stock
  we&rsquo;ve driven,&rdquo; said Rock, when he had dismounted to face the
  men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon we have,&rdquo; rejoined Dunne, and made as if to mount his
  horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay on the ground,&rdquo; ordered Rock. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
  see one Half Moon brand, did you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who said we was lookin&rsquo; for Half Moon brands?&rdquo;
  blustered Dunne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&mdash;Out with the truth! You didn&rsquo;t see one Half Moon
  brand?&rdquo; demanded Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you punchers? Neither did you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Rock, we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the one who had whispered
  to Dunne. &ldquo;An&rsquo; if we&rsquo;d had our way this deal wouldn&rsquo;t
  hev come off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right.... Dunne, go for your gun!&rdquo; commanded Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated Dunne, hoarsely, his face turning
  yellow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear?... Any man who thinks me a rustler has got to
  back it with his gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I&mdash;I&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;Throwin&rsquo; guns
  wasn&rsquo;t in my orders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne, you don&rsquo;t fit on this range,&rdquo; replied Rock, in
  bitter scorn. &ldquo;Keep out of my way hereafter.&rdquo; Then he turned to
  the other riders. &ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;re not willin&rsquo; parties to
  this raw deal Dunne gave me. Any self-respectin&rsquo; cowboy, if he calls
  another a rustler, knows it&rsquo;s true and is ready to fight.... Tell
  Hesbitt exactly what happened here. If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll hold it
  against you. Tell him rotten gossip on the range isn&rsquo;t proof of an
  outfit&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Rock, we&rsquo;ll shore give Hesbitt the straight of
  this,&rdquo; replied the rider.</p>

  <p>The four mounted men rode away, and Dunne made haste to get astride and
  follow. Rock called after him:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne, I reckon all the Prestons&mdash;Ash in particular&mdash;will
  take your insult to me home to themselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The three young Prestons with Rock certainly took it so. Through the whole
  affair they had been pale, set-faced, silent. After Dunne and his men left
  they broke out, Al worst of all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, True, look ahere,&rdquo; he protested, when Rock tried to
  quiet him, &ldquo;it means we Prestons are suspected of
  rustlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon so. By that particular Hesbitt outfit. But, Al, that
  isn&rsquo;t much to rile you. This Wyomin&rsquo; outfit is sort of new. They
  want to boss the range. I met Clink Peeples, another Hesbitt foreman.
  He&rsquo;s not a bad fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Dad goin&rsquo; to say?&rdquo; queried Al,
  wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>Ash</i> goin&rsquo; to <i>do</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  the thing?&rdquo; returned Tom, tragically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looks bad to me, boys,&rdquo; added Harry, gloomily. &ldquo;Clears
  up some queer remarks I heard in town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rustle home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock agreed to that last, whereupon they bent united efforts to breaking
  camp.</p>

  <p>On the third day following, early in the afternoon, Rock and his cowboys
  left the herd of steers in the meadowland below Slagle&rsquo;s ranch, and
  rode on home, a weary and silent four, scattered wide along the lane.</p>

  <p>The labor of the past few weeks had been so strenuous and the application
  to it so zealous that Rock scarcely realized the lapse of time. What had
  happened at Sunset Pass during the interim? He hoped but little. What
  pleasure he might have had in driving the herd down to the Pass, ahead of
  schedule, had been spoiled by the advent of the Half Moon outfit and the
  necessity of revealing it to Preston.</p>

  <p>Rock asked the brothers to keep their mouths shut, but strict observance
  of their promises was not likely. Indeed, by the time he had shaved and
  changed his clothes, there came rapid footfalls, followed by a thump on his
  cabin door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he called, for he had taken the precaution to
  lock the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston. Open up,&rdquo; came the peremptory reply.</p>

  <p>Rock slid back the bar, whereupon Preston stamped in, with Ash close
  behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boss!&rdquo; said Rock, cheerfully, and nodded to Ash. But
  his geniality did not inhibit a lightning scrutiny of both men, especially
  the latter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Al busted in with a wild story,&rdquo; broke out Preston, waiving a
  greeting. &ldquo;Said Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfit spied on you while you was
  drivin&rsquo;? Then they rode into your camp. Five of them. Feller named
  Dunne in charge. He was mean as a skunk an&rsquo; said he&rsquo;d look your
  herd over. But when you called him an&rsquo; he found out who you was he
  tried to hedge.... Al says you made him inspect every steer you
  had&mdash;an&rsquo; after that dared him to throw a gun.... Al was terrible
  excited. Darn fool blurted thet all out in front of the folks.... Rock, was
  he just loco, or is he exaggeratin&rsquo; a little run-in you had with one of
  Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfit&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, Al told the truth, and put it mild at that,&rdquo; replied
  Rock, and turned to tie his scarf before the mirror. In the glass he saw
  Preston&rsquo;s eyes roll and fix with terrible accusation upon his son.
  &ldquo;Sit down, both of you,&rdquo; went on Rock, and presently faced them
  again. Ash was coolly rolling a cigarette, his face a mask. Preston had been
  drinking of late, but appeared sober, and now, though grim and angry, met
  Rock&rsquo;s glance steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet&rsquo;s short an&rsquo; sweet,&rdquo; he said, with a
  gruff laugh. &ldquo;So you come in only a little short of five hundred
  head?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Four eighty, if we counted correct.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful job!&rdquo; exclaimed Preston, as if the eulogy had to be
  paid. &ldquo;Never expected you till mid-August. What you think,
  Ash?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, how&rsquo;d you get such work out of Al an&rsquo; the
  twins?&rdquo; queried Ash, from a cloud of cigarette smoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were plumb fine,&rdquo; replied Rock, with enthusiasm.
  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t ask any better boys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet pleases me. Too bad such a fine job had to end
  bad,&rdquo; said Preston. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d they take this suspicious
  deal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mad as hornets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be Prestons if they wasn&rsquo;t.... Rock, suppose
  you tell us everythin&rsquo; thet come off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus adjured, Rock began a minute narrative of the situation from the day
  Al caught the two riders spying upon him from the slope. When he reached a
  point where he too had observed watchers, Preston interrupted with a curse,
  then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Al didn&rsquo;t tell me thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He never knew it. I thought I&rsquo;d better keep it to myself
  until I saw you,&rdquo; returned Rock, and then went on with the story, which
  the rancher allowed him to complete.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you invited Dunne to draw?&rdquo; he queried, rising with his
  eyes like lights behind transparent veils.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I did. Reckon I was good and sore,&rdquo; admitted Rock.
  &ldquo;But what could you expect of me? He made me out a rustler, though he
  crawfished yellow on it. Besides, that insult extended to my boss,
  didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It shore did,&rdquo; rejoined Preston, thick-voiced. &ldquo;Rock,
  suppose Dunne couldn&rsquo;t have been bluffed? What then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you call yourself a Westerner?&rdquo; queried Rock,
  derisively. &ldquo;Gage, you haven&rsquo;t been long out here, or you&rsquo;d
  never ask a fool question like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; it an&rsquo; I want to
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have bored him,&rdquo; answered Rock, provoked to
  something he seldom yielded to. &ldquo;And I told Dunne to keep out of my
  way. If I meet him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock,&rdquo; interposed Ash, in a voice that made Rock&rsquo;s
  flesh creep, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it I&rsquo;ll meet him
  first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, I never expected you&rsquo;d stand up fer me thet
  way,&rdquo; burst out Preston, genuinely moved. &ldquo;Course I never knew
  you. It means more&rsquo;n I can tell you, havin&rsquo; my youngsters be with
  you then. I just can&rsquo;t thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; returned Rock, turning it off with an easy
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, would you mind givin&rsquo; me your angle on this deal?&rdquo;
  went on Preston, relaxing to earnest anxiety.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most as short an&rsquo; sweet as the other. Hesbitt is a new
  rancher here. He doesn&rsquo;t know our range. He&rsquo;s never been a
  cowboy. There&rsquo;s been some rustlin&rsquo;, as you know. Like in my day
  here years ago. Reckon Hesbitt has been losin&rsquo; most of any of you
  ranchers. He&rsquo;s sore, and his outfits are tryin&rsquo; to be
  Wyomin&rsquo; smart. They&rsquo;ve picked on you. That&rsquo;s my
  angle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, by &mdash;&mdash;! it&rsquo;s as clean an&rsquo; sharp as
  everythin&rsquo; else about you,&rdquo; returned Preston, perturbed.
  &ldquo;Ash, did you savvy thet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, but I ain&rsquo;t awful impressed,&rdquo; replied the son,
  puffing smoke. Rock could not see his face, but he had further reason to
  respect Ash&rsquo;s cunning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, do you figger thet other old-timers hyar have the same
  angle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say so, unless some one like Slagle. But naturally
  he&rsquo;d be quick to think ill of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston paced the room, gazing down at the bare rough-hewn floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon this hyar deal wouldn&rsquo;t be particular bad fer me if it
  wasn&rsquo;t fer our butcherin&rsquo; bizness,&rdquo; he remarked, as if
  thoughtfully to himself. Rock, however, divined that was a calculating
  speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hit it, Gage. There&rsquo;s the rub. My hunch is you must quit
  the butcherin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Rock, deliberately, his eye on Ash. He
  anticipated that individual&rsquo;s reaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will, by thunder!&rdquo; replied the rancher, wheeling
  instinctively to face his son.</p>

  <p>Ash rose out of the cloud of smoke. At that moment, for Trueman Rock,
  nothing in the world could have been so desirable as to smash that face. Ash
  took no notice of his father&rsquo;s decision. He flipped his cigarette butt
  almost at Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m butcherin&rsquo; tomorrow, Mister Rock,&rdquo; he
  asserted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Butcher and be darned!&rdquo; retorted Rock, absolutely mimicking
  the other&rsquo;s tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; too thick out here,&rdquo; said Ash,
  backing to the door, which he opened. &ldquo;I told you once to clear out.
  This&rsquo;s the second time. There won&rsquo;t never be no third.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See here, Ash, I&rsquo;m not tryin&rsquo; to run your affairs. I
  was just givin&rsquo; my angle. Take it for what it&rsquo;s worth. As for
  clearin&rsquo; out&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll consider that. Reckon I don&rsquo;t
  want to make trouble between you and your folks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ash backed out the door, his wonderful blue eyes like fire under ice, then
  he stalked off the porch toward his cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gage, that bull-headed son of yours will be the ruin of you,&rdquo;
  said Rock, turning to the rancher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord! don&rsquo;t I know it!&rdquo; groaned Preston from under his
  huge hands. His massive frame wrestled. Up he sprang, to lift clenched fists,
  and broke into an ungovernable rage that both astonished and mystified Rock.
  The rancher&rsquo;s face turned a purple hue; his thick neck bulged almost to
  bursting. He stamped and cursed and swung his arms, as a man of strength and
  will baffled and defeated. The paroxysm subsided, and he grew composed, but
  if there was not actual hate in the set glare of his deep gray eyes, then
  Rock erred in his belief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, some way or other you must persuade Ash to give up the
  butcherin&rsquo;, at least for a while. Make him think so. Anythin&rsquo; to
  gain time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, why don&rsquo;t you persuade him?&rdquo; queried Preston,
  significantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; ejaculated Rock, shot through and through with an
  impression he hoped was false. He did not betray that he had grasped
  Preston&rsquo;s dark hint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry an&rsquo; I have kept him layin&rsquo; off since you left. I
  reckon we&rsquo;d better try the same again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, try whatever worked. But don&rsquo;t oppose him,
  Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I guess not. I&rsquo;ll let him cool off a bit, an&rsquo;
  tackle him after supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock remained away from the supper table, though the second bell rang. He
  found in his pack enough to satisfy him. He did not feel hunger. It was a
  trying hour as he watched from his window. There was little sunset color,
  owing to heavy clouds. Thunder rumbled off in the hills, and as dusk fell
  quickly, sheets of pale lightning flared along the horizon.</p>

  <p>Presently Rock saw Preston, accompanied by Thiry, come out of his cabin
  and cross over to enter Ash&rsquo;s. A light flashed from the window.
  Rock&rsquo;s first thought was to creep under that window and listen. But for
  risk to Thiry he would have done so; however, he decided to go down through
  the grove and come up between Ash&rsquo;s cabin and Thiry&rsquo;s, and wait
  for her.</p>

  <p>It was quite dark when he slipped out. The air was sultry, and smelled of
  brimstone and rain. Lightning had struck somewhere near the ranch that day.
  He stole among the trees, and making a half-circle he came up to the bench
  under Thiry&rsquo;s pine, and sat down there to wait, thrilling with
  anticipation of soon seeing her white form emerge from the blackness.</p>

  <p>But an hour passed. She did not come. Another went by! The light burned in
  Ash&rsquo;s window, and now and then a dark form cast a shadow. The
  conference was still going on. Rock knew surely that Thiry had not left
  Ash&rsquo;s cabin; he had watched for that, all the time he had circled
  it.</p>

  <p>The night threatened to be stormy. The stillness gave place to a moaning
  of the wind, and thunder rumbled nearer. Drops of rain pattered on
  Rock&rsquo;s bare head. The lightning flared brighter, showing the black
  mountains and the Pass leading to them.</p>

  <p>All the lights except that one in Ash&rsquo;s cabin were now out. The
  hours passed, strangely full for Rock. The longer he waited, the less
  impatience he felt. He had been drawn into the whirlpool of this Preston
  catastrophe, and he would stick it out, come what might. How the wind moaned
  overhead! It was like a knell. And the weird flashes of lightning along the
  battlements of the horizon fitted the melancholy sound.</p>

  <p>It must have been long after midnight when Rock heard a door close. He
  waited, straining eyes and ears, beginning to wonder if he had been mistaken
  about not missing Thiry. He reassured himself. Another door closed, and that
  he was sure had come from Preston&rsquo;s cabin. How pitch black it was at a
  little distance! Then a pale sheet of lightning illumined the heavens. By its
  aid Rock discerned a white form, gliding swiftly. Thiry! He must not frighten
  her, and decided to call out when she came near enough. The pale sheet
  lightning favored him once more. She was so close that the lightning shone
  live silver fire on her bare head. He moved to intercept her, peering to
  pierce the gloom. He did not want to speak loud, so he waited.</p>

  <p>Out of the blackness a slender vague shape glided, like a specter. The
  darkness was deceptive. Rock let her get right upon him, so close he could
  have touched her, and his heart suddenly contracted violently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry! Thiry!&rdquo; he whispered, unable to make his voice clear
  or steady. He heard her gasp. Like a statue she stood. He had a poignant
  instant of remorse for succumbing to his selfish longing to see her. This
  would alienate her further.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry! Don&rsquo;t be frightened. I waited.... It&rsquo;s
  Trueman,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she cried, and seemed to loom on him out of the
  shadows. Her arms swept wide and that extraordinary action paralyzed Rock.
  The next instant they closed round his neck.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">ROCK stood stiff and immovable as the pine tree by his side,
  but his mind, his heart received the fact of that embrace with tumultuous
  violence. Scarcely had Thiry clasped him when she uttered a cry and released
  the convulsive hold, her hands unlocking and sliding down from each shoulder
  as if bereft of strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;beside myself!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>Taking her hand, Rock led her to a seat on the bench under the pine, where
  she sank almost in collapse, her head bowed. Rock resisted his natural
  impulses&mdash;crushed down the exultation of the moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, why did you&mdash;do that?&rdquo; he asked, in a low
  whisper, holding her hand tight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But dare I take it&mdash;as &rsquo;most any man would such action
  from a girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done... I&rsquo;m amazed&mdash;shamed again at myself.
  What must you think of me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I think all that&rsquo;s wonderful and beautiful. But I
  think also I&rsquo;m entitled to an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, how can I explain what I scarcely realize?&rdquo; she
  said, with pathos. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been hours with Dad and Ash. Oh, it was
  sickening. We begged&mdash;we prayed Ash to give up&mdash;plans he has. He
  was a fiend. So was Dad. But I kept trying till I was exhausted.... It must
  be two o&rsquo;clock.... As I came across to my cabin I was thinking of how
  you met that Half Moon outfit. How you resented suspicion against Dad! My
  poor sick heart must have warmed to you with something&mdash;surely with
  gratitude. You seemed my only friend. I was wondering how I should thank
  you&mdash;tomorrow.... Then you rose right out the black ground. What fright
  you gave me! And when you spoke I&mdash;I just&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She faltered and broke off leaving him to guess the rest. Rock&rsquo;s
  compassion overcame his more powerful emotions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, you&rsquo;ve explained how upset you were&mdash;and why. But
  that would not make you fling your arms round my neck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guilty,&rdquo; she replied, distantly. &ldquo;If you
  can&rsquo;t be understanding&mdash;generous&mdash;then take it how you will.
  ... After all, I belong to the Preston outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These words, tinged with bitterness, accompanied by the withdrawal of her
  hand from his, gave Rock the cue. This was his hour. His intelligence
  recognized it, but his conscience would not let him rush madly to take
  advantage of her weakness at this critical time. So watching her dim pale
  face against the black pine, he pondered. He seemed scarcely prepared for the
  opportunity which now knocked at the gates. Yet always with this Preston
  problem he had vacillated, procrastinated. He hoped to put off the
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, it&rsquo;s late. I must go in,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you can spare me an hour,&rdquo; he returned, his voice
  gruff with the strain of his emotions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed no! I must go. Good night,&rdquo; she replied, nervously
  rising.</p>

  <p>He grasped her arm, not gently, and pulled her down on the seat, this time
  closer to him, and he held her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You stay here. Reckon I might remind you that Ash is not the only
  bad hombre on the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To judge from her shrinking, and the trembling of her arm, his speech both
  frightened and angered her. Rock thought it just as well. The tremendousness
  of this Preston situation, and its threatened catastrophe, had kept him at
  top pitch of mental strain for weeks. It could not last. But he divined it
  must grow worse before it could become better. And he seemed gradually
  forcing the issue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, if you detain me by force,&rdquo; Thiry said, coldly.
  &ldquo;Why were you waiting for me at this unheard-of hour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw you go into Ash&rsquo;s cabin, and I thought I&rsquo;d wait
  till you came out. Reckon it never occurred to me you&rsquo;d be so long. But
  I kept waitin&rsquo;. At that the time flew by.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you were spying on me&mdash;on us?&rdquo; she queried, a
  quicker note in her voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon so, if you want to use hard words. But sure my strongest
  motive was just to see you, talk to you a minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;ve done that, please let me go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, you upset everythin&rsquo; when you put your arms round my
  neck,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harp on that,&rdquo; she flashed, hotly. &ldquo;I never
  did such a thing before. I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t to any other man. It just
  happened. If you want to spare me let me forget it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could you ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might make myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll never let you,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, stubbornly.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve froze up the last few minutes. That hurts. I have my own
  battle to fight, and you&rsquo;re not helpin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your battle!... Trueman Rock, if you had a hundredth part of my
  battle to fight&mdash;you&mdash;you&rsquo;d flood the range in
  blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love you. My life is wrapped up in you.... And don&rsquo;t we
  read that self-preservation is the first law of nature?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The most selfish, yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, let me make your battle mine,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Tell
  me what weighs so upon you. Tell me your secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have no secret,&rdquo; she replied, shakily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust my love?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I would if I dared,&rdquo; she whispered, in poignant pain.</p>

  <p>Rock had wrenched that truth from her. Therein lay her weakness, the
  vulnerable spot upon which he must remorselessly make his attack. If she did
  not already love him, certain it seemed that he could make her. This horrible
  secret was clamping her heart; and Ash&rsquo;s baneful influence was like a
  poisonous lichen.</p>

  <p>Rock felt assailed by insurmountable temptations. He would not stifle his
  conscience, but every moment he became more convinced that in order to save
  her he must play upon her weakness, force her to confession, betray his
  knowledge of her guilty sharing of Preston&rsquo;s secret. He strove for
  self-control. In vain!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, you might dare anythin&rsquo; on my love,&rdquo; he
  began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;no! If it were only myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock realized that Thiry was governed by her emotions. She was too honest
  for base secrets, and certainly too honest to hide her love, once she
  realized it. Rock became more convinced that she did feel tenderness for him,
  perhaps unconsciously, and he could not stem the torrent of his hopes and
  fears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, there are only two people in all the world&mdash;you and
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How silly, Trueman. You <i>are</i> selfish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s selfish to love you&mdash;worship you&mdash;to
  want your burdens on my shoulders&mdash;to save you from trouble,
  disgrace&mdash;to make you happy&mdash;then indeed I am sure
  selfish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What a delicate instrument she was for sensibility! Through her wrist,
  which he held, he felt the intermittent slight quiverings, then at the word
  disgrace a distinct shock. Hurriedly she rose, and all but released
  herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you speak of love and&mdash;and disgrace in one breath?&rdquo;
  she queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And you understand,&rdquo; he replied, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry darling, I can forgive your falsehood to all except
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, pride and fear in one gasp. She shook in
  his grasp.</p>

  <p>It did not take much of a pull to get her into his arms, and in another
  moment he had her helpless, lifting her from the ground, her face close under
  his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, don&rsquo;t you love me a very little?&rdquo; he asked, deep
  tenderness thrilling in his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!... Oh, let me go!&rdquo; she implored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be honest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be... I&rsquo;m such a liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, I love you so wonderfully. Ever since that minute you
  stepped in Winter&rsquo;s store.... Didn&rsquo;t you like me then&mdash;or
  afterward?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I did. But what&rsquo;s the use to talk of it....
  You&rsquo;re holding me in a&mdash;a&mdash;most shameless manner.... Let me
  go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll hold you this way a long time.... Till you say
  you love me a little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She essayed to free herself, but her strength fell far short of her
  spirit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll hold me until daylight&mdash;when Ash will see
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, say a little short of daylight. Reckon I can get along with
  that for a while.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;please&mdash;please!... Trueman, this is
  outrageous!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sure is. &rsquo;Most as outrageous as your deceivin&rsquo;
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How have I deceived you?&rdquo; she demanded, vibrating to
  that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For one thing&mdash;carin&rsquo; about me a little. You do,
  don&rsquo;t you, Thiry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Care about you? I suppose I&mdash;I did, else I couldn&rsquo;t have
  been such a fool as to go to that dance. But what&rsquo;s caring?... It
  certainly doesn&rsquo;t give you license to hold me against my
  will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon that depends on what you mean by care. I&rsquo;m
  arguin&rsquo; you love me a little bit. Sure I&rsquo;ve prayed enough for
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You pray! You&rsquo;re a fine Christian,&rdquo; she retorted,
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christian or not I&rsquo;ve sure prayed you&rsquo;d love
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then your prayers have been unanswered&mdash;as mine have
  been,&rdquo; she said, in mockery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, I must make sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon first off I&rsquo;ll kiss you a couple of thousand times and
  see if I can tell by that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I, though. Sure I&rsquo;m a reckless cowboy. Now
  watch me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And with action at strange variance with his bantering words he bent to
  kiss her hair again and again and again, and then her ear, and last her
  cheek, that changed its coolness under his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he whispered, and drew her head back on his shoulder
  so her face would be upturned. To his piercing eyes the darkness was as if it
  were not. &ldquo;Sure <i>they</i> were only worshipful kisses.... Do you hate
  me for them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hate you.... Please let that do. Let me
  go&mdash;before it&rsquo;s too... Trueman, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> too late, Thiry, for both of us,&rdquo; he whispered,
  passionately, and he kissed her lips&mdash;and then again, with all the
  longing that consumed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now will you confess you love me&mdash;a little?&rdquo; he asked,
  huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O God help me&mdash;I do&mdash;I do!&rdquo; she cried, and her eyes
  seemed deep accusing gulfs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More than a little? Thiry, I didn&rsquo;t expect much. Sure I
  don&rsquo;t deserve it.... But tell me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, more.&rdquo; And she twisted to hide her face, while her left
  arm slowly crept up his shoulder, and went half round his neck.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what was the matter with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did you know?&rdquo; he asked, amazed in his incredulity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just now.... But I knew there was something wrong
  before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, bless you!&mdash;if this&rsquo;s not a one-sided affair,
  kiss me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no.... If I give up&mdash;we&rsquo;re ruined,&rdquo; she
  whispered, tragically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure we&rsquo;re ruined if you don&rsquo;t. So let&rsquo;s have the
  kisses anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, since I never can&mdash;marry you&mdash;I&mdash;I
  mustn&rsquo;t kiss you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, one thing at a time. By and by we&rsquo;ll tackle the
  marryin&rsquo; problem. I&rsquo;d go loco if I thought you&rsquo;d be my wife
  some day.... But just now make this dream come true. I want your kisses,
  Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t.... It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it.... Thiry, I&rsquo;ll compromise. I&rsquo;ll be
  generous. Just one&mdash;but not like that fairy kiss you gave me on
  Winter&rsquo;s porch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, if I give <i>one</i>&mdash;it means all... ten million
  will follow,&rdquo; she said, tremulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear, I&rsquo;ll save the nine hundred and ninety nine thousand,
  and so forth.... Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And lifting her head he turned her face to his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are wrong to&mdash;to master me this way,&rdquo; she rejoined,
  mournfully. &ldquo;If you knew&mdash;you might not want it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Master nothin&rsquo;? I am <i>your</i> slave. But kiss me. Settle
  it forever!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How slowly she lifted her pale face, with eyes like black stars! In the
  sweet fire of her lips Rock gained his heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>

  <p>Then she lay in his arms, her face hidden, while he gazed out into the
  stormy night, across the black Pass to the dim flares along the battlements
  of the range. His victory brought happiness and sorrow commingled. In the
  tree-tops the mournful wind did not presage a future without strife. But the
  precious form in his arms, the mortal flesh that embodied and treasured an
  infinitely more precious gift&mdash;her love&mdash;lifted his spirit and bade
  him go on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Trueman, explain what you meant by my&mdash;falsehood to
  all?&rdquo; she asked, presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite prepared?&rdquo; he returned, gravely. &ldquo;Sure
  it&rsquo;s not easy to rush from joy to trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat up, startled, with hands nervously releasing their hold. All about
  her expressed doubts, misgivings, but she had no inkling of what he had to
  reveal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, you are keepin&rsquo; Ash&rsquo;s and your father&rsquo;s
  secret from all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman!&rdquo; she cried, as if her own mind had deceived her
  ears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are cattle thieves. Beef thieves. So are your brothers Range,
  Scoot and Boots, along with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O my God!&mdash;You know!&rdquo; she almost screamed, and slipped
  to her knees before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush! Not so loud! You&rsquo;ll wake some one,&rdquo; he said,
  sternly, placing a firm hand over her mouth. &ldquo;Get up off your
  knees.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But she only leaned forward, clutching him, peering up into his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, how do&mdash;you know?&rdquo; she gasped,
  convulsively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suspected it when I first came. I found signs. Quicklime! That
  made me suspicious. Slagle&rsquo;s well is half full of hides. Sure those
  hides have not the Preston brand.... Then over near where they butchered last
  I came on the same boot track that I&rsquo;d seen down near the
  slaughter-house. I trailed that track. It led under a culvert. There I found
  hundreds of hides, tied up in burlap sacks. Most were old, but some were new.
  I opened one. That hide had a Half Moon brand! Down here at your barn, one
  day, after the dance, I measured Ash&rsquo;s boot track. It was the same as
  that one I&rsquo;d trailed.... But for real proof, I heard your Dad and Ash
  talkin&rsquo; together. One night I happened to be out, thinkin&rsquo; of
  you, watchin&rsquo; like tonight. Your father and Ash came out, right to the
  log where I sat. I lay down.... And I heard them talk about this. They gave
  it all away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you were a spy!&rdquo; she burst out, in hot agonized
  words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew&mdash;it would come.... It will&mdash;kill me,&rdquo; she
  wailed, brokenly. &ldquo;Oh, to make love to me&mdash;while you were spying
  on my brother&mdash;my father!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Little girl, I told you to speak low.... Reckon it does look pretty
  bad to you. But it&rsquo;s not so bad as it looks&mdash;so far as I&rsquo;m
  concerned. But, Thiry, you&rsquo;re in this secret and you would be held
  guilty in some degree in court, if your part in it was found out. And let me
  tell you Ash would hold no secret. He would drag even you into it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! No! No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He would. And there&rsquo;s the danger for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Court!&mdash;Danger?... My God! you mean they&rsquo;ll be
  arrested&mdash;and I will be dragged in with them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon that is liable to happen,&rdquo; he replied, wanting, stern
  as the task was, to impose upon her once and for all the peril of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d betray us!&rdquo; Swift as a striking snake her hand
  darted out and snatched his gun as it rested against his thigh. Leaning back,
  she extended it with both hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, if you believe I could betray you or
  them&mdash;shoot!&rdquo; he replied, swiftly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will not tell?&rdquo; she flashed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never. You sure got me wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She gave vent to a shuddering sound. The gun fell from her hands. She
  swayed. He could see her eyes were tight shut. Then she sank forward, her
  face on his knees, and clinging to him she broke into low sobs, every one of
  which was like a knife-thrust to Rock.</p>

  <p>He let her have it out, and stroked her hair, and her tight fists, one of
  which clenched his scarf, the other his coat sleeve. She did not recover
  soon, though presently the sobs gave way to soft weeping. Then he held her
  closer, scarcely seeing her or the black pine-streaked gloom, or the
  stretching flares of yellow light along the horizon. He was seeing something
  blacker than the night, more sinister than the shadows. As a last resource,
  to save her and her father, he could kill Ash Preston. That would kill
  Thiry&rsquo;s love, but protect her name and insure a chance for her future
  happiness. But for Ash, this blundering, thieving work could be halted in
  time to prevent discovery. The range was lenient. Preston already saw the
  error of his ways. He could be amenable to any plan. Ash was the
  stumbling-block.</p>

  <p>At this brooding juncture of Rock&rsquo;s meditations he became aware that
  Thiry was stirring. She rose from her knees, while still clinging to him, and
  she sank beside him on the bench, to lean against him, face uplifted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry, you talk nonsense sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I might have shot you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I thought you were goin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was out of my head. I should have known you would never betray
  us.... My wits were gone. Everything went but a hot terrible fury. Oh,
  Trueman, I am a Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon I don&rsquo;t want you anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can <i>anything</i> be done to save us?&rdquo; she queried,
  appealingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must be done, Thiry. Sure I don&rsquo;t know what. My
  mind&rsquo;s not workin&rsquo; any better than yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare not breathe a word of this. They would kill you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never give Ash a hunch that I know. He&rsquo;d come pilin&rsquo;
  after me with a gun. Don&rsquo;t tell your father anythin&rsquo;....
  There&rsquo;s no great hurry. We&rsquo;ve got time. I&rsquo;ll find some
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You promise me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; he replied, solemnly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Trueman, you are my one hope. To think I&rsquo;ve tried to
  drive you away!... That I nearly shot you!... How little I know myself. But I
  do know this&mdash;if you stop this selling of stolen beef&mdash;if you
  prevent it before they&rsquo;re arrested&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
  love you with all my heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling, I will do it somehow,&rdquo; promised Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; she said, rising, and swaying
  unsteady.</p>

  <p>He lifted her in his arms and walked toward her cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I an empty sack, that you pack me so easily?&rdquo; she
  whispered, with a little intimate laugh that thrilled him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so I&rsquo;d notice it,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>At the door of the cabin he set her gently upon her feet. She still held
  him with one clinging hand, and that unconscious act was balm to Rock&rsquo;s
  distracted heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad now you came to Sunset Pass,&rdquo; she whispered.
  &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve added to my fears. It&rsquo;s now you, too, who might
  fall under the Preston shadow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you read my letter&mdash;that I slipped under your door, before
  I left?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; she said, touching her breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read it again. Be brave, Thiry. Don&rsquo;t give up.... Never lose
  faith in me.... Good night,&rdquo; he concluded, and loosing her hand he
  kissed it, and fled silently into the darkness.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Forty-eight hours later Rock rode into Wagontongue.</p>

  <p>Gage Preston had been more than glad to give him leave of absence, sensing
  no doubt in Rock something not inimical to his precarious fortunes. In a note
  to Thiry, Rock explained the reason for his going, importuning her to wait
  patiently, and not to be victim to imagined evils&mdash;that somehow he would
  find a solution.</p>

  <p>He rode into Wagontongue the old True Rock of earlier and wilder range
  days. Yet though that was a fact, in defiance, in cool exterior, no day of
  his life had ever seen the passion, the will to invent and achieve, that one
  single moment now embodied.</p>

  <p>Though plan after plan had formulated on the long ride in, only one seemed
  a solution&mdash;to call Ash Preston out and kill him. Against this idea he
  fought, knowing that it had for him a drawing power not solely based on
  consideration for Thiry and the Prestons. This spirit dominated him in times
  past. He wanted to surrender to it now, and argued with himself that the most
  this trip might accomplish was to relieve the tension at Sunset Pass.
  However, that was no inconsiderable accomplishment, for his presence acted
  upon Ash Preston like a red flag flipped in the face of a bull. With him
  gone, perhaps Thiry and Gage could restrain Ash for some weeks. And even days
  of grace now were precious.</p>

  <p>When Rock dropped in to see Winter it was not with any definite purpose;
  but that night he and his old friend locked themselves in a room at the
  hotel. There were range channels open to Winter to which Rock had no access.
  The Preston situation was graver&mdash;actual accusations had been made, it
  seemed. But by whom was not manifest. Winter talked while Rock listened. It
  did not take long to impart information that was endless in its
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, old-timer, I&rsquo;m in deep,&rdquo; said Rock, at the
  conclusion of Winter&rsquo;s confidence, and he opened his palms
  expressively. &ldquo;Thiry loves me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; replied Winter, sagely wagging his head. &ldquo;But
  you wouldn&rsquo;t take her an&rsquo; leave the country?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I couldn&rsquo;t think of that yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know anythin&rsquo; thet makes Preston&rsquo;s guilt
  shore?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I promised Thiry not to tell it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you can go to Preston an&rsquo; tell <i>him</i> you know. Scare
  him to sense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I can. More&mdash;I know I can stop him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. That seems a solution. It&rsquo;s not too late. Go back
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, Gage Preston can&rsquo;t call his soul his own. I reckon Ash
  led him into this and now has got him buffaloed. Nothin&rsquo; on earth or in
  heaven can stop Ash Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo; echoed Winter, but the incredulity of the
  West rang in his sarcasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; but lead!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!... Wal, I never yet seen thet kind of a hombre miss
  meetin&rsquo; it.... Leave him out. Now, Rock, I&rsquo;ve an idee. If Dabb
  an&rsquo; Lincoln know what I know&mdash;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a good bet they
  know more&mdash;they will <i>tell</i> you. Thet obviates any broken promise
  on your part. Dabb is human. Lincoln is the whitest man in these parts.
  They&rsquo;re both rich, an&rsquo; they rule the Cattle Association. Hesbitt
  is only president. What Dabb an&rsquo; Lincoln say is law.... Now you go to
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Sol, good Heavens! What for?&rdquo; queried Rock,
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, you are so deep in love thet you ain&rsquo;t practical. If you
  can get Dabb an&rsquo; Lincoln to sympathize with you an&rsquo; Thiry,
  thet&rsquo;ll be sympathizin&rsquo; with Preston. Ten years ago there was a
  case somethin&rsquo; like this, only instead of a rancher bein&rsquo; a
  butcher he was a rustler. Rich, too an&rsquo; in respectable standin&rsquo;,
  till some slick cowpuncher tracked his outfit down. Wal, his friends got him
  to make good what he&rsquo;d stole, an&rsquo; saved him from jail, if no
  worse. Preston&rsquo;s case ain&rsquo;t so bad, thet is, yet.... Trueman,
  I&rsquo;ve grown gray here. I&rsquo;ve been raised with these ranchers. I
  know them.... If you&rsquo;ve got the nerve an&rsquo; the wit you can keep
  Preston from ruin an&rsquo; Thiry from a broken heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock leaped up, inspired, suddenly on fire with the vision Winter&rsquo;s
  sagacity had conjured up. He pushed aside table and chair, and hugged his
  startled friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old-timer, I&rsquo;ve sure got the nerve and you&rsquo;ve supplied
  the wit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock did not have a restful night, and loss of sleep added somewhat to his
  haggard looks. Next morning Clark, the hotel proprietor, jocosely twitted
  Rock, saying he had heard that Rock had sworn off drinking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I have,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like it.... Wal, no doubt you&rsquo;ve got
  your worries&mdash;hangin&rsquo; with that Preston outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Other acquaintances of Rock&rsquo;s remarked about his visit to
  Wagontongue, and did not hide their curiosity.</p>

  <p>When Rock presented himself at Dabb&rsquo;s office he encountered more
  that was significant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Rock! You sure look rocky,&rdquo; replied Dabb, in answer to
  his greeting. &ldquo;Hope you haven&rsquo;t been drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Only worried.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too bad. Have a chair and a cigar. I&rsquo;ve been hopin&rsquo;
  you&rsquo;d run into town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dabb appeared cordial. He had a cleaner, brighter look, and had evidently
  paid attention to his appearance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Amy?&rdquo; queried Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She was fit as a filly when I saw her last. She went to Denver to
  visit. Expect her home next week. Reckon she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give
  another dance this fall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! Wasn&rsquo;t that Fourth of July dance enough?&rdquo;
  ejaculated Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a great success. Biggest affair we ever had out here.... Too
  bad you couldn&rsquo;t stay for the unmaskin&rsquo;. You sure made up fine as
  Señor del Toro.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Then Amy told you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But not till next day. I saw you lick that Ash Preston.
  Can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it,&rdquo; rejoined Dabb, with a
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I can say I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Accordin&rsquo; to Amy you had your hands full before that fight.
  She was inclined to be sore, Rock. Told me you paid no attention to her. I
  was there, masked as a padre. Had heaps of fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I hurt Amy&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
  replied Rock, dejectedly. &ldquo;God knows I can&rsquo;t afford to lose my
  few friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Rock? Things goin&rsquo; bad out
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone from bad to worse.... John, I told you I was in
  love with Thiry. Well, <i>that</i> wasn&rsquo;t so bad. But now she&rsquo;s
  in love with me. And the situation is hell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;ve only yourself to blame. You were advised not to
  go. I myself told you not to stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I loved the girl,&rdquo; replied Rock, simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Dabb, chewing at his cigar. &ldquo;You fell in
  love with Thiry before you went out there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. Otherwise do you suppose I&rsquo;d have gone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably not.... Well, that puts another light on it.... Why
  don&rsquo;t you run off with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Run off? John, you know I&rsquo;ve many faults, but runnin&rsquo;
  off was never one of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You run off from me, you son-of-a-gun,&rdquo; retorted Dabb,
  good-naturedly. &ldquo;But after you told me, I respected your motive....
  Rock, gettin&rsquo; serious, are you goin&rsquo; to stick out
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else can I do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And go under with Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I must&mdash;<i>if</i> he goes under.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally you have your hopes.... Rock, some of us cattlemen know
  you haven&rsquo;t looked for anythin&rsquo; shady about Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Rock, curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that question came up the other night at our Association
  meeting. Hesbitt gave you a hard rub. Over this Preston scandal. Tom Lincoln
  an&rsquo; I an&rsquo; one or two others took exception to Hesbitt. We claimed
  you not only weren&rsquo;t in with Preston on anythin&rsquo; crooked, but you
  hadn&rsquo;t trailed around lookin&rsquo; for it. The reason, of course, was
  you were sweet on Thiry Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John, that was most damned good of you,&rdquo; returned Rock,
  warmly. &ldquo;If I could be cheered up that might do it. But I&rsquo;m sure
  down.... You an&rsquo; Lincoln figured that if I had looked for shady work
  I&rsquo;d have found it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. We knew that. No outfit could fool you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so easy. But personally I believe you&rsquo;d have come to me
  for advice an&rsquo; help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d have presumed so far,&rdquo; went
  on Rock. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I came to town for. I was
  goin&rsquo; to see Amy and persuade her to help me out of this terrible mess.
  More for Thiry&rsquo;s sake than mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Rock! You pay Amy a high compliment, if you think
  she&rsquo;d help you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gamble she would. Amy has a heart of gold. Sure, she has
  to be persuaded. But the good side of Amy is the stronger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Rock. Amy takes a lot of handlin&rsquo;,
  an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m findin&rsquo; out&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo;
  you, to my happiness.... Of course, the only way Amy could help you would be
  through me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have to admit that. But much as I&rsquo;m buffaloed, I
  didn&rsquo;t have the nerve to come direct to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. What&rsquo;s worryin&rsquo; you now, Rock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfits are after Preston,&rdquo; replied Rock, and
  he gave Dabb a detailed account of Dunne&rsquo;s man&oelig;uver at the Notch
  camp, and what had come of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You dared that foreman Dunne to throw his gun?&rdquo; exclaimed
  Dabb, gravely, removing his cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sure did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, that was a bold move an&rsquo; a wise one. Reckon it was the
  only way any honest range-rider could meet such a raw deal. But suppose you
  meet this Dunne again, in more favorable circumstances for him, an&rsquo; he
  shows fight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate it, but I&rsquo;ll sure go through with my call. No
  cowman can insult me like that. He&rsquo;ll either crawl again, as he did
  then, or shoot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I&rsquo;m darn glad you told me this. Reckon it didn&rsquo;t
  seem important to you&mdash;that I knew&mdash;for you&rsquo;d have told it
  quick. But it is important.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Rock, curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place it vindicates Lincoln an&rsquo; me, in our
  stand for you. An&rsquo; it will stump Hesbitt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!&mdash;Then this new rancher is dead set against
  Preston?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he? Well, I guess. An&rsquo; he has his outfits
  r&rsquo;arin&rsquo;.... Now, Rock, the strange thing is, Hesbitt has been
  losin&rsquo; a good deal of stock&mdash;most Half Moon brand&mdash;an&rsquo;
  his men can&rsquo;t locate them. Hide nor hair!... But other men
  have!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, what&rsquo;re you tellin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; shouted Rock,
  fiercely. He did not need to dissimulate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yell, cowboy. Walls have ears,&rdquo; admonished Dabb.
  &ldquo;Rock, now listen. You once rode for Jem Slagle. You know him. Preston
  ruined Slagle. An&rsquo; Slagle has hung around out there to get even. Reckon
  he&rsquo;s in a fair way to do it. For he has tracked the Prestons down. But
  he wants to get his money back, or some of it. Sure he knows if he threatens
  Preston with exposure he&rsquo;ll only get shot for his pains. So he came
  first to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, this&rsquo;s awful!&rdquo; groaned Rock. &ldquo;Jem
  Slagle....An&rsquo; he has tracked Preston down?&mdash;What to,
  John?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fresh Half Moon hides hidden close to where Preston last butchered.
  He can show these any time. I called Tom Lincoln in to talk it over. We
  advised Slagle to keep mum an&rsquo; wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was the idea in that?&rdquo; demanded Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re all ranchers, you know,&rdquo; replied Dabb,
  meditatively, as if the query had before presented itself to him. &ldquo;In a
  little way, more or less, we&rsquo;ve all appropriated cattle not our own.
  Reckon we hate to make a move. The stolen cattle were not ours, you see.
  It&rsquo;ll mean a fight. An&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve passed the buck to
  Hesbitt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, John, by Heaven! you&rsquo;ve passed it to me,&rdquo; returned
  Rock, with passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Rock, you don&rsquo;t want to take this deal on your
  shoulders,&rdquo; protested Dabb.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you? I put it up to you straight,&rdquo; demanded Rock,
  eloquently. &ldquo;Suppose you loved Thiry. Suppose she loved you, and
  you&rsquo;d found out what a sweet girl she is.... That if her father went to
  jail it&rsquo;d break her heart&mdash;or kill her.... Now what would you
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I&rsquo;m damned if I know,&rdquo; replied Dabb, red in the
  face, and he slammed his unsmoked cigar to the floor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
  cropper. An&rsquo; I hate to be beaten by anythin&rsquo; in the cattle
  line.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, and I&rsquo;m sure
  thankin&rsquo; you for the hunch,&rdquo; returned Rock, passionately.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy Slagle&rsquo;s silence. I&rsquo;ve five thousand
  dollars in the bank. I&rsquo;ll stop Gage Preston&rsquo;s stealin&rsquo;
  before it&rsquo;s too late... And if I have to, I&rsquo;ll call Ash Preston
  out!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; exclaimed Dabb, violently. &ldquo;Not that last,
  anyway.... Rock, will you never settle down to peaceful ranchin&rsquo;? You
  might be a credit to this range. And you&rsquo;d lose the girl and ruin her
  happiness, sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it might be the only way out,&rdquo; returned Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose you come to my house for dinner tonight. I&rsquo;ll have
  Tom Lincoln. We&rsquo;ll talk it over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was an interminably long day for Rock. His reasoning told him if there
  was an escape out of this range tangle Dabb and Lincoln would help him to
  find it. Nevertheless, the suspense, on the heels of all the other emotion,
  was almost insupportable.</p>

  <p>The days were growing shorter and it was dusk when he walked out to the
  mansion that was John Dabb&rsquo;s home. What a place for little Amy Wund to
  preside over! His remembrance of her then was kindly and grateful. Surely she
  must have had much to do with John Dabb&rsquo;s transformation.</p>

  <p>Rock was admitted to a cheerful library, and the presence of Dabb and
  Lincoln.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Rock! Get down an&rsquo; come in,&rdquo; was Dabb&rsquo;s
  greeting. &ldquo;Glad you came early.... Tom, you remember True Rock,
  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lincoln was a little gray withered cattleman, bright of eye, lean of face,
  not apparently a day older than when Rock had last seen him. He looked like a
  Texas Ranger, and had been one in his day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore do,&rdquo; replied Lincoln, extending a lean hand.
  &ldquo;Howdy, Rock! Do you remember when you first come to Wagontongue
  an&rsquo; got sweet on my girl? An&rsquo; I chased you out of the yard one
  night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Lincoln, I don&rsquo;t remember, but you&rsquo;re probably
  right,&rdquo; replied Rock, joining in the laugh on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, his girl-chasin&rsquo; days are over. Sit down, friends,
  an&rsquo; smoke while I talk,&rdquo; said Dabb. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two
  more fellows comin&rsquo; after dinner, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have a little
  game of draw after.... Now, Rock, I&rsquo;ve talked your trouble over with
  Tom, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s his angle. I&rsquo;m bound to say I think it a
  solution to a nasty problem. At that it hinges most on you.... Go back to
  Preston an&rsquo; tell him the truth. That he&rsquo;s found out by some
  cattlemen, an&rsquo; he must quit his butcherin&rsquo; stolen cattle before
  Hesbitt gets on to him. Tell him he&rsquo;s to come before the Cattle
  Association. That means Tom an&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; Hesbitt, sure, but we can
  handle him. We&rsquo;ll keep the deal out of court an&rsquo; Preston out of
  jail, provided he comes to us, pays Slagle off, an&rsquo; squares Hesbitt for
  the stock he has lost. Then Preston, an&rsquo; his four sons, especially this
  Ash Preston, who&rsquo;s the ringleader, no doubt, must leave the
  country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful fair and fine of you gentlemen,&rdquo; returned Rock,
  instantly, his set face breaking. &ldquo;Reckon I couldn&rsquo;t find words
  to thank you. I won&rsquo;t try. Preston doesn&rsquo;t deserve this. Sure it
  is generous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Rock, it&rsquo;s aboot this heah way,&rdquo; put in Lincoln,
  with his slow Southern accent. &ldquo;We shore can afford to be generous
  because Preston hasn&rsquo;t stole from us. Then we don&rsquo;t want the
  range slandered by such a raw case. Who&rsquo;d ever think the Prestons would
  stoop to that? Mrs. Preston is a nice woman and the girls are ladies. Shore
  they cain&rsquo;t be in the secret. We&rsquo;d like to keep Preston out of
  jail for their sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Rock. What do you say?&rdquo; queried Dabb, as if in a
  hurry to get it over. &ldquo;Will you settle it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, with one reservation,&rdquo; replied Rock, grimly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can manage Preston. But when Ash finds out, he&rsquo;ll fight. He
  can&rsquo;t be persuaded or frightened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; your reservation is you&rsquo;ll have to kill
  him,&rdquo; interposed the imperturbable Texan as he flicked the ashes off
  his cigar, his bright eyes on Rock.</p>

  <p>Rock did not make any reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darn tough on the girl. My wife says she loves this particular
  brother,&rdquo; added Dabb, regretfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;s tougher on Rock, but <i>quien sabe</i>? You shore
  cain&rsquo;t ever tell aboot a woman,&rdquo; rejoined Lincoln.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in to dinner,&rdquo; said Dabb, opening the door.
  &ldquo;Rock, how&rsquo;d you like a little poker afterward?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it fine,&rdquo; replied Rock, shaking off a cold
  black spell, and fetching a laugh, as they went out. &ldquo;That is, if the
  limit is worth while.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See heah, cowboy, the limit in Dabb&rsquo;s house is the
  roof,&rdquo; drawled Lincoln.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hate to take your money, gentlemen,&rdquo; responded
  Rock, &ldquo;but a chance like this seldom comes along for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">BEFORE sundown of another day Rock reined his sweating horse
  in front of Slagle&rsquo;s cabin, and dismounted to approach that individual,
  who, probably having heard him, had come to the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slagle, I want to talk Dutch to you,&rdquo; said Rock, without any
  greeting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thought you looked kinda serious. Any trouble
  brewin&rsquo;&mdash;er happened?&rdquo; returned Slagle, permitting Rock to
  lead him aside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dabb told me you&rsquo;d come to him with proof of Preston&rsquo;s
  guilt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The devil he did!&rdquo; ejaculated Slagle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and my business with you is to buy your silence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slagle showed further amazement and interest. He listened intensely to
  Rock&rsquo;s story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, cowboy, air you makin&rsquo; this offer on your own
  hook?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. I told only Sol Winter, who had my money banked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What on earth fer? Rock, excuse me, fer appearin&rsquo; to
  insinuate. But it looks darn queer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jess, I&rsquo;m honest. I&rsquo;m not in on the Preston steal, and
  you sure know that. I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to stall the thing off. Now I
  figure you as pretty sore, and I don&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; no mistake there,&rdquo; growled
  Slagle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;ll you take to keep mum?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, this hyar don&rsquo;t set right on me. Lord knows I need
  money, but I ain&rsquo;t so low-down I&rsquo;d take a cowboy&rsquo;s
  savin&rsquo;s. What&rsquo;s your idee? You shore can&rsquo;t care thet much
  about Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jess, you re wastin&rsquo; my time,&rdquo; replied Rock,
  impatiently. &ldquo;I love Thiry Preston and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to save
  her dad because of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I savvy. Shore call it decent of you. Makes me want to act square
  with you. An&rsquo; the fact is, Rock, I couldn&rsquo;t prove anythin&rsquo;
  on Preston now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Half Moon hides have been moved from where I found
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say? Where was that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over the next hill hyar, under thet big culvert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, no matter. You did find them, and your word would convince
  ranchers, if not a court. My offer stands. What&rsquo;ll you take?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, hev you got backin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve my own money. Cash!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much you got?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;d you ever get thet much?&mdash;Rock, I&rsquo;m afeared
  you must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been a road-agent somewhere,&rdquo; he said,
  jocularly, and he paced up and down thoughtfully. &ldquo;Wal, I hate to take
  you up, Rock, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t if I didn&rsquo;t feel shore
  you&rsquo;ll get it back, or some, anyhow. Say I take half of what you
  got&mdash;twenty-five hundred. Preston will have to pay you. An&rsquo;, Rock,
  I&rsquo;ll pack an&rsquo; rustle out of hyar pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave the range?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. An&rsquo; darn glad to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, and better. It may be a long time till somebody
  else gets proof on Preston. And it&rsquo;s time I&rsquo;m gamblin&rsquo; on.
  ... Here&rsquo;s your money, Jess. I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; two
  promises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh! What are they?&rdquo; queried the homesteader, his eyes
  popping at the roll of greenbacks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep Preston&rsquo;s secret and don&rsquo;t get drunk before you
  leave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon thet&rsquo;s easy. Rock, I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.
  I&rsquo;ve got another chance in life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be successful,&rdquo; returned Rock, stepping
  over to his horse and mounting. Slagle followed him, and laid a red-haired
  hand on Rock&rsquo;s chaps. His eyes held a scintillating prophetic
  light.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; to bet all this hyar money, five
  to one, thet if you save Gage Preston, you&rsquo;ll hev to kill
  Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Spurring Egypt sharply, Rock swore lustily at the vindictive homesteader
  and galloped away.</p>

  <p>Though Rock put the white horse to a finish that concluded a wonderful
  day&rsquo;s travel, it was well after dark when they reached the Pass. Lights
  were burning in all the Preston cabins. At the barn Rock encountered one of
  the Mexican lads, and turned Egypt over to him. With that he stalked back
  through the grove. Peering into the kitchen door, he espied Mrs. Preston and
  Alice and Lucy at their evening chores.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, folks! Is it too late for a bite and a cup of coffee?
  I&rsquo;ve had nothin&rsquo; since yesterday. Starved isn&rsquo;t the
  word!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Rock, you sure look it,&rdquo; replied Alice, gayly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowboy, it&rsquo;s never too late in this chuck-house,&rdquo;
  returned Mrs. Preston. &ldquo;Come in and sit down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Heavy boot thuds out on the porch attested to the approach of men. Rock
  certainly did not keep his back to the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who come in, Ma?&rdquo; queried Preston, outside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A poor starved cowpuncher,&rdquo; replied his wife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s only Mr. Rock,&rdquo; added Alice, quickly, with a
  knowing glance at Trueman.</p>

  <p>Outside some one violently slapped what sounded like a pair of gloves on
  the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pa, didn&rsquo;t I tell ye?&rdquo; growled Ash Preston&rsquo;s
  unmistakable voice. &ldquo;Thet hombre can&rsquo;t keep away from Thiry
  &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Footfalls, sharp and quick, rang off the porch to thud on the ground.
  Silence ensued. Rock turned to the women. Mrs. Preston had her head bent over
  her stove, but Alice&rsquo;s eyes met Rock&rsquo;s, flashing, intelligent,
  resentful. Then Preston&rsquo;s dragging steps approached. The doorway framed
  his burly form.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boss!&rdquo; greeted Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Back so soon? Reckoned you&rsquo;d stay out your leave,&rdquo;
  replied the rancher, with gloomy penetrating gaze on Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rustled back,&rdquo; said Rock, meaningly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon all I got is good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh.... Wal, come in, soon as you want to,&rdquo; concluded
  Preston.</p>

  <p>Alice and her mother set before Rock a bounteous meal and while he gave
  ample evidence of appreciating it, they asked questions about the town. Rock
  imparted all the information he could muster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I near forgot,&rdquo; he added, presently, with a wink at
  Alice. &ldquo;Yesterday I run into your beau, Charlie. He shore pumped me
  about you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My beau! Trueman Rock, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; He&rsquo;s not
  that,&rdquo; exclaimed Alice, blushing furiously. The mother&rsquo;s quick
  look was not lost on Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Allie. I just naturally thought he was, from the way he
  talked. Sure does need two to make a beau, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly it does,&rdquo; returned Alice, and behind her
  mother&rsquo;s back she gave Rock an eloquent glance, accompanied by the
  motion from a threatening little fist. Rock opened both mouth and eyes, in
  remorseful enlightenment, then went on with his meal. Mrs. Preston had
  occasion to go out the back door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wretch!&rdquo; whispered Alice. &ldquo;Mother thinks I&rsquo;m
  too young.... And I&rsquo;m crazy to go to that next dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure stupid, Allie.... Lucky boy!... Heigho! I wish I
  could go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we all, Trueman?&mdash;Thiry spoke of it today,&rdquo;
  Alice bent close to Rock&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s crazy about
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allie&mdash;<i>you</i> wretch! It can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! How can you think that way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I accused her of being.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock leaned closer to the tempting lips, as if they were dispensing
  music.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry denied it. But she got red as fire&mdash;then mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The entrance of Mrs. Preston put an end to this whispered exchange. Soon
  afterward Rock strode out to seek Preston. On the porch he halted, and gazing
  out at the spectral pines and up at the blinking stars, and across the thick
  void toward Thiry&rsquo;s bright window, he called on all the passion and
  wisdom that might come through hope and prayer. The moment he confronted
  Preston the climax of this situation would have been set in motion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, you didn&rsquo;t break any laigs gettin&rsquo; hyar with thet
  good news,&rdquo; growled Preston, as Rock entered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you won&rsquo;t be r&rsquo;arin&rsquo; for me to hurry,
  after I start,&rdquo; replied Rock, closing the door and facing the rancher
  with intent unmasked gaze. &ldquo;Preston, not a whisper of what I say must
  be heard by anyone but you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come close then, an&rsquo; talk low.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Rock drew a chair up to Preston&rsquo;s, and eying him squarely,
  whispered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, the jig&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean?&rdquo; hoarsely rejoined the rancher, as if shot
  through with something that froze his vitals. He knew! It was only an
  outburst.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re found out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s found out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your butcherin&rsquo; stolen cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slagle found Half Moon hides under that culvert above his place. He
  told John Dabb. Dabb told Tom Lincoln. Then me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston&rsquo;s eyes set with greenish glare; his face, too, took on a
  greenish-white cast and otherwise changed grotesquely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; And as if to shut out the revealing light he
  covered his face with nerveless hands.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s first thrill came with the rancher&rsquo;s reception of this
  news. It augured well. But he let the revelation sink deep. He waited.</p>

  <p>At length Preston lifted his haggard countenance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can Slagle prove thet&mdash;on me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t. The hides were there, and now they&rsquo;ve been
  moved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, then, I&rsquo;ll deny everythin&rsquo; an fight
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gage, <i>I</i> can prove you guilty,&rdquo; whispered Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can?... How?&rdquo; returned Preston, with solemn glaring
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash&rsquo;s tracks. I trailed them. I measured them. I got his boot
  track here in the corral. I saw that same track leadin&rsquo; down to the
  culvert and under it. I compared them. I ripped open one of those burlap
  sacks. The Half Moon brand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash!&rdquo; And the hissed word was a curse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ve split on Ash Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The big hands clenched, and opened wide, and plucked at the grizzled
  locks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, you wouldn&rsquo;t ruin me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you shore couldn&rsquo;t break Thiry&rsquo;s
  heart?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you need to ask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does anyone else have the proofs on me&mdash;like you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not yet. But I&rsquo;m not the only trailer on this range.
  Somebody will trail your sons, as I did Ash. <i>If you don&rsquo;t stop
  them!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Then it ain&rsquo;t too late?&rdquo; he queried, huskily, and
  the corded veins in his neck bulged, his temples throbbed and reddened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What a rasping breath escaped the broad chest!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does anybody else suspect&mdash;beside the four you
  named?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hesbitt&rsquo;s outfits are scourin&rsquo; the range. They suspect.
  But they don&rsquo;t know. Reckon sooner or later they&rsquo;ll hit on
  somethin&rsquo;. Old sign. It might not convict, but it&rsquo;d ruin you just
  the same. And any fresh sign&mdash;Preston, you&rsquo;ll all go to
  jail!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, are you comin&rsquo; in with me&mdash;an&rsquo;
  Ash&mdash;an&rsquo; Thiry?&rdquo; asked Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in with you and Thiry now. Not Ash.... But clean and
  honest, Preston. I&rsquo;ve laid my cards before Dabb and Lincoln. They know
  me. I couldn&rsquo;t be crooked now&mdash;not to save your life and
  Thiry&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!&mdash;What&rsquo;s the deal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll agree to what I lay before you we can stall off the
  worst.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean by worst?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ruin for your family. Jail for your sons. Perhaps
  bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! thet last is shore as hell with Ash in it.... Rock, I get a
  hunch you&rsquo;ve been workin&rsquo; to ward off this ruin. Fer
  Thiry&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally I think of Thiry first,&rdquo; went on Rock, with deep
  emotion, warming to the impending argument. &ldquo;But also I&rsquo;m
  thinkin&rsquo; of her mother and sisters&mdash;and the boys who&rsquo;re as
  innocent as they are. In fact for all of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you save us? Not countin&rsquo; Ash. He&rsquo;s outside of any
  deal. An&rsquo; on him we&rsquo;ll stumble. Through Ash will come this worst
  you harp on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered Rock, bursting with his message.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shut Slagle&rsquo;s mouth. I&rsquo;ve bought his silence.
  He&rsquo;s leavin&rsquo; the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord Almighty!... How&rsquo;d you do it? What&rsquo;d you give
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Preston whistled low. &ldquo;Of all the fellars I ever seen,
  you&mdash;&mdash;Rock, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to square thet with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure you are. You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to square it
  <i>all</i>....Listen. Come to town with me. I&rsquo;ve got it all fixed. Dabb
  will call a meetin&rsquo; of the Cattle Association council. That means him,
  Lincoln, and Hesbitt. To keep this out of court you will agree to pay Hesbitt
  for his Half Moon stock. Dabb and Lincoln have promised me they&rsquo;ll
  handle Hesbitt. It will all be done in secret. Then you and your sons who
  were in this deal must leave the country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fair enough, but I reckon I&rsquo;d rather fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, don&rsquo;t let pride and anger blind you. By
  fightin&rsquo; you will lose your golden chance. We all believe Ash roped you
  into this butcherin&rsquo; stolen cattle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shore did. He was killin&rsquo; stolen steers long before I ever
  knew. Then it was too late to stop him. An&rsquo; I drifted in myself. All so
  easy! Only a few head of stock at a time! Nobody could ever guess! An&rsquo;
  now.... Rock, I&rsquo;d almost as lief croak as face thet council. They might
  let me off, but they&rsquo;d tell. It&rsquo;d leak out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, you&rsquo;re not thinkin&rsquo; clear. You don&rsquo;t see
  this right. Straight out you&rsquo;ve fallen to worse than rustlin&rsquo;. If
  you don&rsquo;t take this chance&mdash;for the sake of your
  womenfolk&mdash;you&rsquo;ll ruin them. And you&rsquo;ll be as bad as Ash.
  You&rsquo;re no fool. I&rsquo;d say, if it weren&rsquo;t for your wife and
  daughters, you should <i>quit</i> this crooked work and fight the whole
  range. If you met up with a bullet, well and good.... But you&rsquo;re not
  alone. You&rsquo;ve got wife to think of&mdash;daughters, innocent boys....By
  Heaven! Preston, I can&rsquo;t let you ruin Thiry. She&rsquo;s guilty now, to
  some extent, for she shares your guilty secret. Ash would drag her with
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shore will&mdash;unless you kill him!&rdquo; muttered this
  implacable father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if I do&mdash;Thiry will hate me,&rdquo; replied Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mebbe she would. We Prestons shore can hate, but we don&rsquo;t
  change from love to hate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; you, Preston,&rdquo; fumed Rock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  had a feelin&rsquo; more than once that you&rsquo;d not stop me from
  drawin&rsquo; on Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell, no! An&rsquo; you would have long ago if you&rsquo;d had the
  guts you once was noted fer.... But Thiry has got you locoed.... Come in with
  us, Rock. We&rsquo;ll fight this deal, sell out, an&rsquo; go to Arizona or
  Utah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Rock, fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, I&rsquo;ll think your idee over good an&rsquo; hard.
  Rock, my not acceptin&rsquo; it pronto doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t
  appreciate your wonderful offer an&rsquo; all thet prompts you. I shore do.
  It may be the best way to save them. But the wife&mdash;Thiry, Allie,
  Lucy&mdash;they&rsquo;d have to know, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d almost shore rather
  die in my boots than tell them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, we don&rsquo;t have to tell. No one but Thiry will ever
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Thet&rsquo;s much in its favor. I&rsquo;ll think it
  over.... Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll stop Ash if I have to hawg-tie him. An&rsquo;
  you better take the boys an&rsquo; go off in the woods somewhere. They
  deserve a vacation. But no goin&rsquo; in to town. Take them huntin&rsquo;.
  It&rsquo;s most turkey season. An&rsquo; let me know where you go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Well as Trueman Rock knew that country, it was his fortune to be taken by
  the Preston boys to high hunting-grounds which he had never visited or heard
  spoken of on the range.</p>

  <p>It was up in the mountains back of the Pass, about a day&rsquo;s climb on
  horseback, eight thousand feet above the low country. Up there early fall had
  set in and the foliage was one gorgeous array of color. The camp, which was
  where they threw their bed-rolls and built their fire, lay in a mountain
  meadow, at the edge of a magnificent grove of quaking asps. Behind on a
  gentler slope stood scattered silver spruces and yellow pines, growing larger
  as they climbed, until on the ridge above they massed, in the deep timber
  line, which like a green-black belt circled the mountain under the gray
  grisly weathered and splintered peaks.</p>

  <p>A golden glamour seemed to float over that grove and to enrich all objects
  under the aspens, the fallen poles, the rocks and grass, the camp equipment,
  and the men themselves. It was cast by the golden sunlight falling through
  the dense aspen foliage, not a quivering leaf of which did not burn pure
  gold. Even when there was no wind the leaves fluttered, as if endowed with
  life that was trembling, dying.</p>

  <p>Rock fell in love with this place more than any in which he had ever
  dropped a saddle. How poignantly he needed the beauty, the color, the
  solitude! He had come up there on the ragged edge of utter desperation. But
  scarcely were the boys out of sight and the horses grazing along the
  green-bordered brown stream, still and deep, when Rock began to feel
  something at work on his restless, seeking, undefeated mind.</p>

  <p>The hour was along toward sunset, and the brothers had gone off to hunt a
  little before the day ended. Rock felt grateful to Preston for this respite
  up under the peaks. Like scales he cast off the outer and worn vestments of
  his mental strife.</p>

  <p>Across the meadow, scarcely half a mile wide at this its upper end, rose a
  slow undulating mountain slope, in hue so varied and brilliant that it did
  not seem actual landscape. Scarlet vines covered the boulders and outcropping
  of rock at the edge of the wood. A grove of oaks, sturdy, spreading wide
  their branches clad in green-bronze leaves, had thrived to the elimination of
  spruces, except a few giants that could not be choked out. Back of these
  oaks, aspen, maple, and pine thickets vied in gold, purple, and green to
  excel one another. Soon the vast panoply of black timber belt submerged the
  lower thickets, except in open spots here and there that shone like gold and
  cerise and scarlet eyes out of the forest. Above the timber line gulches with
  threads of white snow wound toward the peaks. And lastly the bold steel teeth
  of rock bit at the blue sky.</p>

  <p>A very faint moan of wind floated down from the pines. From some lofty
  height an eagle whistled piercingly, and as if in reply, on the wooded ridge
  an elk bugled. Snowbirds were cheeping back in the grove, and on the wing
  somewhere wild canaries were twittering, both series of notes totally
  different, yet pregnant with the same portent&mdash;autumn was at hand. The
  wood behind the aspen grove gave forth familiar sounds of nature, the screech
  of jay, the chatter of squirrel, the crack of antler on dead wood, the rustle
  and tread and brush of denizens of the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Rock dreamily heard all, so restless, so soothing, and yet within them he
  seemed to hear a step upon his trail. It was the haunting future.</p>

  <p>Then a rifle-shot rang out, to crack in echo, to peal along the slopes,
  and roll away suddenly. Nothing like a gunshot to transform Trueman Rock. He
  left off his meditations, his watching, listening, waiting absorption, to
  take up camp tasks. Action was better than rest.</p>

  <p>Then the brothers returned to camp, Al with a wild turkey, the twins with
  nothing. And the atmosphere of loneliness, of solemn solitude, of presageful
  nature, seemed less in evidence. How quickly Sunset Pass, with its work and
  problems, fell off the shoulders of the Preston boys! They were young. Rock
  envied them, though he rejoiced that the trials of the range had not yet
  settled on them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee! I seen a big buck,&rdquo; said Harry, excitedly.
  &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get a bead on him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope Dad doesn&rsquo;t send for us soon,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s great, but I hate to miss that dance. Somebody will
  jilt me,&rdquo; sighed Al.</p>

  <p>In the morning Rock was awakened by the gobbling of turkeys. The boys
  slept on, blissfully unaware that their favorite game had almost invaded the
  camp. Rock crawled out, revolver in hand, and soon espied the big birds at
  the edge of the grove. A gobbler stood up straight, head high, his
  purple-and-black breast puffed, his beard hanging low. Rock&rsquo;s hand
  moved and stiffened, his gun boomed, the turkey fell. A roar of wings
  attested to the flight of his flock. Shouts behind Rock indicated the alarm,
  consternation, and delight of the brothers. Securing his gobbler, Rock walked
  into camp and laid it before the roused Prestons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By golly! right in camp!&rdquo; ejaculated Tom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How far was he off?&rdquo; queried Harry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty far. Most fifty yards, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; replied
  Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You nailed him with a six-gun?&rdquo; queried Al, in wonder and
  disgust. &ldquo;Say, you can&rsquo;t shoot a-tall! Reckon I&rsquo;d just as
  lief not be Dunne when you meet up with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus the hunting began for Rock, and he entered into it heartily. A white
  frost glistened on the grass, ice had formed in the pans; the meat the boys
  had hung up was frozen stiff. Therefore Rock sanctioned the boy&rsquo;s plan
  of killing wild game to pack down to the ranch. Hung in the shade, it would
  not spoil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, you try for turkeys and deer,&rdquo; suggested Rock.
  &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t miss an elk, if you see one. I&rsquo;ll climb for a
  sheep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a rider used to horses it was no child&rsquo;s play to mount to the
  heights. Rock tortured his lungs and his long legs. He sighted a few rams,
  but they passed out of range. And he was not good enough sheep-hunter to
  stalk his game properly. Nevertheless, every day he climbed the slopes,
  watched for hours from the crags, and returned to camp late, tired
  physically, yet rested and strengthened in his mind. It was good to get away
  from the Pass and think with clarifying vision. It was well, too, to be
  alone, for in the past weeks he had fallen back upon an old habit&mdash;the
  drawing of a gun to bring back and insure the swiftness that had once been
  his. This action alone was grim indication of his extremity. He dared not
  slight it, though he fought against admitting the reason for it to his
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>The days passed until Rock had no idea how long he had been absent from
  the Pass. Nearly a fortnight, he guessed. Then came Indian summer, that
  enchanting brief period of smoky, warm, still days, and floating amber and
  purple haze in the air.</p>

  <p>Al Preston left to go down home for supplies. This threw Rock into a fever
  of uncertainty. What news would he fetch back? What message from Preston?
  Would Thiry write? The day was long, the night interminable, the second day
  unbearable. Rock wandered in the open forest across from camp, wanting always
  to be in sight of the trail that came up from below. Mid-afternoon ought to
  see Al ride in. That would allow ample time for the slow pack-horse. He sat
  on a pine log in the open forest above the oak grove. The smoky haze, the
  purple veils, the warm, swimming air, so full of fragrance and dreamy
  languor, the riotous mosaic of autumn colors, the melancholy birds, the dim
  sun still high and red above the slope of the mountain&mdash;these held Rock
  in strong grip, making it possible for him to wait.</p>

  <p>Then a gray laden pack-horse emerged from the green wall across the
  meadow. Rock suffered both thrill and pang. Next came a dark horse holding a
  slight rider that could not be Al Preston. Who could it be? Not the youngest
  Preston lad. Perhaps it was some boy Al had brought or sent. For Al was not
  in sight. Another pack-horse cleft the dark green gap where the trail
  emerged. And after it Al on his big bay. The foremost rider waved to the boys
  in camp. How they yelled! Rock watched with eyes starting and expanding. What
  was there strangely familiar about that rider? Yet he knew he had never seen
  him before. Rock never forgot a mounted rider. Suddenly he leaped up madly.
  Thiry!</p>

  <p>He ran. He leaped the brook. He made the camp in bounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry! Of all people!... Aw, I&rsquo;m so&mdash;glad to see
  you,&rdquo; he panted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Trueman!&rdquo; Her smile was strained and she scarcely met
  his eager gaze. He had never seen her in rider&rsquo;s garb. Could that make
  such difference? She wore a tan blouse, with blue scarf, fringed gauntlets,
  overalls, and high boots. She looked like a boy until she dismounted. Rock
  had a wild desire to snatch her in his arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, throw my pack and unroll my bed,&rdquo; she said. And while
  the boys obeyed with unified alacrity she led the stunned Rock away from
  camp, under the golden aspens, into the forest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see me?&rdquo; she asked, looking ahead at the windfalls
  and the splashes of brilliant hues.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad!&rdquo; he echoed, as if words were inadequate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t show it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry!... I&rsquo;m loco.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She still held his hand, that she had taken openly before her brothers.
  Rock could not shake off his trance. Still, it did not seem the Thiry he
  knew. Her cheek was warm with a golden tint, partly from the exposure of the
  long ride, partly from the reflection of the leaves above. The blood did not
  come and go, like a life current under a pearl shell. She halted beside a
  great fallen spruce with rugged seamed bark. &ldquo;Lift me up,&rdquo; she
  said. And when he had complied she held him with strange hands, and looked
  into his eyes as she had never before. A black squirrel squalled from a
  silver spruce that towered over them. All around the forest inclosed them,
  standing and fallen timber, sapling pines and sturdy junipers, patches of
  aspen, white-stemmed with dead gold foliage, quaking as with a tremor of
  their roots. The thick tang of pine filled the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; this unknown Thiry said, not shyly, nor yet boldly,
  but somehow unnaturally for her. When Rock obeyed, restraining himself, in
  his bewilderment, she put her arms around him and her face against his
  neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad news, Trueman dear,&rdquo; she said, as if forced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I could have guessed it. But it&rsquo;s welcome, since it
  fetched you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash made a killing of Half Moon steers and shipped the beef from
  Wagontongue,&rdquo; went on Thiry, talking by rote.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s frame jerked with the hot gush of blood through his veins,
  but he did not voice his anger and dismay. And he remained mute. Her
  monotone, the absence of any feeling, the abnormal something about her,
  fortified him to hear catastrophe which would dwarf what she had already
  told.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad wants you to come in with us&mdash;share our fortunes, our
  troubles&mdash;our sins... help us fight these enemy outfits.... If
  we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; he interrupted, in bitter heat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we. Ash and Dad and I&mdash;and my three brothers... and
  <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I!... And what do <i>I</i> get for spillin&rsquo; blood for
  thieves? Ah, that is Preston&rsquo;s game. He wants me to kill&mdash;to
  spread terror among those Wyomin&rsquo; outfits.... And my reward will
  be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; she said, without emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With Ash Preston&rsquo;s consent?&rdquo; demanded Rock, angered to
  probe to the depths of this proposition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dad claims when you become one of us&mdash;Ash will have to
  consent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry Preston!&mdash;You ask me to do this thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she droned. But he could feel a changing in the stiff
  form against him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ask me to be a thief&mdash;a killer&mdash;to save your rotten
  brother, your weak and crooked father?&rdquo; he flung at her, in a stern and
  terrible voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;ask&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In violence, almost with brutal force, Rock shook her, as if to awaken her
  out of a torpor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! No, you poor driven girl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I would die
  for <i>you</i>, but I&rsquo;ll never let you ruin your soul by such dishonor.
  They have blinded you&mdash;preyed on your love. Your brother is mad. Your
  father desperate. They would sacrifice you. Ash would agree to this,
  meanin&rsquo; to shoot me in the back.... No, Thiry....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;will not?&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never. Not even to have you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly, then, he had a wild weeping creature in his arms, whose cries
  were incoherent, whose beating hands and shaking body wrought havoc to the
  iron of his mood. &ldquo;Oh, thank God&mdash;you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she
  wept, lifting streaming eyes and working face. &ldquo;I prayed
  you&rsquo;d&mdash;refuse. I told Dad you&rsquo;d never, never do it.... I
  told Ash he lied... he&rsquo;d never let you have me.&mdash;But they made
  me&mdash;they drove me&mdash;all night they nagged me&mdash;until I gave in.
  ... Trueman darling, say you forgive. I was weak. I loved him so&mdash;and
  I&rsquo;m almost broken.... But you lift me from the depths. I love you
  more&mdash;a thousand times. Let come what will. I can face it
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hours later Rock kept vigil over a sleeping camp, where near him lay
  Thiry, in deep slumber, her fair sweet face, sad in repose, upturned to the
  watching stars. Beyond, her brothers were stretched in a row, likewise with
  dark faces still and calm in the starlight.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s heart was full to aching. The night was exquisite, clear and
  cold, with blue velvet sky lighted by trains of stars, white sparks of fire
  across the zenith. The night wind sighed through the aspens, soughed in the
  pines, and roared low up on the mountain slope. Coyotes barked and wolves
  mourned. Whatever might betide on the morrow, or thereafter, this night was
  his in all the fullness of requited love, of protective possession. He had
  forgotten the prayers of his youth, yet it was certain that he prayed. There
  seemed infinite strength in the grand dark mountain above, and a mystery all
  about him, in the ceaseless voice of dying insects, in the murmur of wild
  nature.</p>

  <p>In the rose light of dawn, while the Preston boys whistled and shouted at
  the camp tasks, Rock and Thiry again wandered under the silver spruces, the
  golden aspens, the scarlet maples, back to that bit of primal forestland.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back to the Pass,&rdquo; Thiry was pleading.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must. I&rsquo;ll go alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid. If you meet him&mdash;&mdash;Oh&mdash;you
  will!... Trueman, I couldn&rsquo;t hate you. Once I thought I might.... Oh,
  don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She wound her arms around his neck and clung to him with all her
  might.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take me away&mdash;far away across the mountains,&rdquo; she
  begged, her lips parting from his to implore mercy, and then seeking them
  again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way. I am yours, body and soul. I ask
  nothing more of life but that you spare him&mdash;and take me.... The boys
  will let us have a pack. We can cross the mountains. It is not yet
  winter....Then somewhere we two will live for each other. I will forget him
  and all this horror. And you&mdash;will never&mdash;kill another
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry girl, hush; you are breakin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he cried, spent
  with the might of agonized will that denied her kisses, her lissom pressing
  form, her clinging arms. &ldquo;That would be the worst for us both. It would
  brand me with their guilt and drag you down.... No. I shall go
  alone&mdash;make one last stand to save your father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock rode the zigzag descending trail down to the Pass in four
  hours&mdash;another splendid performance of the sure-footed, tireless
  horse.</p>

  <p>There did not appear to be any untoward condition at the ranch that
  obviously affected the womenfolk. Preston had ridden off early that morning
  to a general roundup out on the range, at a place called Clay Hill. Ash
  Preston and his three brothers were off somewhere, probably also at the
  roundup, on their return from Wagontongue. No, they had not driven the beef
  wagons to town this time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll ride over to Clay Hill,&rdquo; muttered Rock, as
  if to himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay for dinner. It&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; said Mrs. Preston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When will Thiry and the boys be in?&rdquo; asked Alice, thoughtful
  eyes on Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before sundown, sure. They were packin&rsquo; when I
  left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was Thiry mean to you?&rdquo; whispered Alice, in an aside.
  &ldquo;She had one of her cold, queer spells.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Allie, she was wonderful good,&rdquo; replied Rock. &ldquo;Why
  did you ask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look so&mdash;so queer,&rdquo; returned the girl hesitatingly.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re neither Señor del Toro nor Trueman Rock this
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Allie girl, how do I look?&rdquo; queried Rock, essaying a
  smile that would not break, which made him aware of the cold tightness of his
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sort of dark, and far away. Older, Trueman, not like yourself.
  I&rsquo;m afraid all&rsquo;s not well between you and Thiry,&rdquo; she said,
  plaintively.</p>

  <p>When he ventured no denial, evidently she convinced herself that her
  intuition had foundation. The children, whom nothing affected adversely, drew
  Rock out of his brooding calm during the meal. Soon afterward he was riding
  down the Pass to take the trail up on the range.</p>

  <p>The old ranch, where Preston had installed the slaughter-house, had lately
  been the scene of extensive butchering. It made a hideous blot on the
  beautiful autumn landscape. And the stench outdid the appearance in
  hideousness. Clouds of buzzards sailed over the gruesome spot, and hordes of
  the grisly birds hopped around.</p>

  <p>As Rock rode by Slagle&rsquo;s old well he satisfied himself, even from
  the saddle, that the dim, unused trail was not so dim. Rock cursed the
  bull-headed fool who was recklessly marching to his downfall, dragging father
  and family with him.</p>

  <p>Rock climbed out of the Pass, up to the rolling rangeland. It unfolded
  from this height before and below him, in magnificent stretches, its vast
  monotony of gray now broken by dots of red and patches of gold. The
  melancholy season hung over the rangeland like a mantle. But it was
  invisible; it might have hidden in the smoky blue haze. Slopes and swales,
  leagues of level land, ridges fringed by cedars, round gray mounds and
  limitless stretches of green&mdash;all were bare of cattle. That added to the
  desert atmosphere. A brooding silence, that seemed emphasized by the
  incessant hum of insects, lay over all. How barren of life! Not a hawk or a
  gopher or a jack-rabbit! Far in the distance the range faded in pure
  obscurity. And through the autumn haze a magenta sun burned, but dully, so
  that Rock could look into it with his naked eye. And as he rode on, at a
  swinging lope, while the sun imperceptibly lowered, so the faint magenta hue
  gained on the gray and green.</p>

  <p>Clay Hill was a famous old roundup ground. The gray bare knob of clay
  rising over a grassy level had given it a name. There were several cabins
  near the springs that gushed from the base of the hill.</p>

  <p>Rock&rsquo;s keen eye snapped at the old-time scene. Dust and color and
  action! Herds of cattle, fields of horses! So he rode on down through the
  cedars, now unable to see the bright variegated plain, and again catching an
  ever-growing glimpse. Not until he rounded the southern corner of Clay Hill,
  where the trail ran, and came abruptly upon the first cabin, horses, wagons,
  men, did he grasp that something was amiss. What could check a general
  roundup in the middle of the afternoon? No cowboys on guard! No cutting or
  branding! No movement, except a gradual straggling of the herds! The men he
  saw were in groups, and their postures were not expressive of the lazy,
  lounging, careless leisure attendant upon meal hours or cessation of
  work.</p>

  <p>Rock had permitted himself no anticipations. But now he divined the hour
  he had long dreaded; and instead of halting, as if momentarily checked by an
  invisible blow in the sinister air, he spurred his horse and rode down upon
  the men, scattering dust and gravel all over them.</p>

  <p>He was off, throwing bridle, gloves, and in two swift jerks he got out of
  his chaps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded of the six or eight cowmen who
  backed away. In the first sweeping glance he did not recognize one of
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fight busted the roundup,&rdquo; replied a lean-jawed rider, whose
  face showed drops of sweat and pale freckles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy Dunne shot,&rdquo; replied an older man, warily, his narrow
  slits of eyes shifting all over Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne!... Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Dunne?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Layin&rsquo; in the cabin thar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock brushed the men aside, to encounter more, all of whom he saw with
  lightning gaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get out of my way,&rdquo; he ordered, sharply, and forcing entrance
  to the cabin, he surveyed the interior. A line of dusty, sweaty cowboys fell
  back, to disclose a man lying on the floor, with another kneeling in
  attendance. A pan full of bloody water, the odor of rum! Rock saw a face of
  deathly pallor, clammy and leaden, and eyes black with pain. Yet he
  recognized the man. The kneeling one was ministering clumsily to him. Rock
  stepped in and knelt, to take up Dunne&rsquo;s inert wrist and feel for his
  pulse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne, I hope you&rsquo;re not bad hurt,&rdquo; said Rock.</p>

  <p>At that the other man looked up quickly. It was Clink Peeples.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Rock!... I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m afeared Jim
  is.... Still I&rsquo;m no good hand at judgin&rsquo; bullet holes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The angry wound was situated high up on the left side, and it was bleeding
  freely, though not dangerously. Rock, calculating grimly, saw that Preston
  had missed the heart by several inches. The bullet had no doubt nicked the
  lung. But there was no sign of internal hemorrhage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he been spittin&rsquo; blood?&rdquo; asked Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I reckon he hasn&rsquo;t. I shore looked for thet,&rdquo;
  answered Peeples.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did the bullet come out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It went clean through, clean as a whistle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Rock, with satisfaction. &ldquo;Dunne, can
  you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, sure,&rdquo; replied Dunne, faintly. A bloody froth showed on
  his lips. &ldquo;Rock, reckon Preston&mdash;beat you&mdash;to this
  job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;d never have done it.... Listen, Dunne. This is a
  bad gunshot, but not necessarily fatal. If you do what you&rsquo;re told
  you&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;think so, Rock?... I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;a
  wife&mdash;an&rsquo; kid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; returned Rock, forcefully. &ldquo;Understand?...I
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, thet&rsquo;s shore&mdash;good news,&rdquo; panted Peeples,
  wiping his face. &ldquo;I was plumb scared. Tell us what to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make a bed for him here,&rdquo; replied Rock, rising. &ldquo;But
  don&rsquo;t move him till he&rsquo;s bandaged tight. Then awful careful. Make
  him lie quiet.... Heat water boilin&rsquo; hot. Put salt in it. Wash your
  hands clean. Get clean bandages. A clean shirt if there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;
  else. Fold a pad and wet it. Bind it tight. Then send to town for a
  doctor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; us,&rdquo; returned Peeples, gratefully.
  &ldquo;Frank, you heard. Rustle some boys now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peeples, was it an even break?&rdquo; inquired Rock, coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m bound to admit it was. So we&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo;
  on Preston thet way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was it about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dunne spoke up for himself, in stronger voice: &ldquo;Rock, I had
  the&mdash;proofs on him&mdash;much as I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;have on
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh!... Don&rsquo;t talk any more, Dunne,&rdquo; replied Rock, and
  turned to Peeples. &ldquo;Do you know what proof he had?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I don&rsquo;t know a damn thing. Jimmy&rsquo;s not a man to
  talk,&rdquo; replied Peeples, in such a guarded way that Rock construed his
  words to mean the opposite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he accuse Ash?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shore did. Braced him soon as he got here with his outfit. I
  didn&rsquo;t see the fight. But thar&rsquo;s a dozen fellers who did. You
  talk to them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock did not need, except out of curiosity, to question anyone further.
  Besides, he knew Dunne had spoken the truth. If there had been any doubt,
  Dunne would have kept his peace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are the Prestons?&rdquo; asked Rock, stalking out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over at the third cabin,&rdquo; replied some one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are they inside, holed-up, lookin&rsquo; for trouble?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore lookin&rsquo; for trouble, but not holed-up, by any means.
  Ash is stalkin&rsquo; to an&rsquo; fro over thar, like a hyena behind
  bars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock elbowed his way out of the crowd. Soon his glance fell upon those he
  sought, and in him surged the instinct of the lion that hated the hyena. Ash
  Preston stalked to and fro, away from the cabin, and when he faced back
  toward the watching men he appeared to do it sidewise. Two of his tall
  brothers sat together, back to the cabin wall. A third, probably Range
  Preston, stood in the doorway, smoking a cigarette. Apart from them sat Gage
  Preston, his burly form sagging, his bare head bowed. His sombrero lay on the
  ground. Rock&rsquo;s impression was that Gage awaited only the sheriff.</p>

  <p>Long ago Rock&rsquo;s mind had been made up and set. He grasped at
  inevitability&mdash;strode forth to meet it, aware of the low excited murmur
  that ran through the crowd behind him.</p>

  <p>Ash, espying Rock, halted in his tracks. The two brothers rose in single
  action, as if actuated by the same spring. Range Preston stepped outside to
  join his brothers. Gage Preston did not see, nor look up, until Rock hailed
  him. Then, with spasmodic start, he staggered erect.</p>

  <p>Ash Preston, seeing that Rock had sheered a little off a direct line, to
  approach his father, hurled an imprecation, and fell to his swift, striding,
  sidelong stalk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; rasped Preston when Rock got to him.
  &ldquo;So double-crossin&rsquo; you like I did means nothin&rsquo; to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, have you been in any of these last butcherin&rsquo;
  deals?&rdquo; queried Rock, sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. An&rsquo; so help me Heaven, I couldn&rsquo;t stop
  Ash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why did you send Thiry&mdash;persuadin&rsquo; me to come in with
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet was why. I wasn&rsquo;t beat then. I figgered I could fight it
  out an&rsquo; I wanted you. So I drove Thiry to it.... But now!... You had it
  figgered, Rock. I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;sorry most fer Thiry, an&rsquo; Ma,
  an&rsquo; the girls. If I had it to do over again,
  I&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do it now,&rdquo; interrupted Rock, ringingly. &ldquo;Come with me
  to Wagontongue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late! Too late!&rdquo; returned Preston, hopelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! The situation is no worse&mdash;for you. For him it <i>is</i>
  too late!&mdash;Come, Preston, be quick. There&rsquo;ll be hell poppin&rsquo;
  here in a minute. Will you give up&mdash;go with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, by Heaven! I will&mdash;if you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yell that to Ash!&rdquo; hissed Rock, strung like a whipcord.</p>

  <p>Preston, with face purpling, shouted to his son, &ldquo;Hey,
  Ash!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; came the snarling answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to town with Rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What fer?&rdquo; yelled Ash, as if stung.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, just off, I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; a marriage license for
  Thiry!&mdash;Haw! Haw! Haw!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What was that raw note in Preston&rsquo;s thick voice&mdash;in the laugh
  which rang loud, clear? Did it connote revenge or hate or menace of the
  moment, or all combined?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>I say what fer?</i>&rdquo; yelled Ash, dancing up and down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>To pay your thievin&rsquo; debts,
  you&mdash;&mdash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, get to one side. Quick!&rdquo; warned Rock, risking one
  long stride forward, when he froze in his tracks, his right side toward Ash,
  his quivering hand low.</p>

  <p>Ash Preston spat one curse at his father&mdash;then saw him no more. Again
  he began that strange sidelong stalk, only now he sheered a little, out
  toward Rock, forward a few strides, then backward the same, never turning
  that slim left side away from Rock. Rock learned something then he never had
  known&mdash;Ash Preston was left-handed. He approached no closer than thirty
  paces. Then he did not or could not keep still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, spy!&rdquo; he called.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you, beef rustler,&rdquo; returned Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am givin&rsquo; you my card pronto,&rdquo; called Ash, louder, more
  derisively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gave you mine at the dance. But I got six left!
  <i>Carramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That stopped the restless crouching steps, but not the singular activity
  of body. Ash&rsquo;s muscles seemed to ripple. He crouched yet a little more.
  Rock could catch gleams of blue fire under the wide black brim of Ash&rsquo;s
  hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Señor del Toro!</i>&rdquo; He had recognized the Spanish
  word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And here&rsquo;s Thiry&rsquo;s mask&mdash;where she put it
  herself,&rdquo; flashed Rock, striking his breast. &ldquo;See if you can hit
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the last he had the wit to throw Ash off a cool and deadly
  balance&mdash;so precious to men who would live by the gun. When Ash jerked
  to his fatal move Rock was the quicker. His shot cracked a fraction of a
  second before his adversary&rsquo;s. Both took effect. It was as if Ash had
  been hit in the head by a club. Almost he turned a somersault.</p>

  <p>Rock felt a shock, but no pain. He did not know where he was hit until his
  right leg gave way under him, letting him down. He fell, but caught himself
  with his left hand, and went no farther than his knees, the right of which
  buckled under him.</p>

  <p>Ash bounded up as he had gone down, with convulsive tremendous power, the
  left side of his head shot away. Blood poured down. As he swept up his gun
  Rock shot him through the middle. The bullet struck up dust beyond and whined
  away. But Ash, sustaining the shock, fired again, and knocked Rock flat. Like
  the first bullet this one struck as if it were wind, high on his left
  shoulder. He heard two more heavy booms of Ash&rsquo;s gun, felt the sting of
  gravel on his face. Half rising, braced on his left hand, Rock fired again.
  He heard the bullet strike. Terrible fleshy sodden sound! Ash&rsquo;s fifth
  shot spanged off Rock&rsquo;s extended gun, knocked it flying, beyond
  reach.</p>

  <p>Preston was sagging. Bloody, magnificent, mortally stricken, he had no
  will except to kill. He saw his enemy prostrate, weaponless. He got his gun
  up, but could not align it, and his last bullet struck far beyond Rock, to
  whine away. Ash&rsquo;s physical strength had not matched his unquenchable
  spirit. He actually tried to fling the empty gun. It flipped at random. To
  and fro he swayed, all instinctive action ceasing, and with his ruthless eyes
  on his fallen foe, changing, glazing over, setting blank, he fell.</p>

  <p>Gage Preston hurried to Rock&rsquo;s side. Men came running with hoarse
  shouts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help me&mdash;up,&rdquo; said Rock, faintly.</p>

  <p>They raised him, speaking in awed voices. Then he dragged them,
  half-hopping, careless of his dangling leg, over to the writhing Ash, in time
  to see his last shudder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;huh!&rdquo; gasped Rock, in emotionless finality, with
  strength and sense slowly failing into oblivion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Rock came to his senses again he was lying on the floor
  of the cabin where seemingly only a few moments before he had given advice as
  to the proper care of the wounded Dunne.</p>

  <p>He gazed around up at the grave faces of cowboys and cattlemen, at Gage
  Preston, who, grim and white, was binding his leg, at Peeples, still working
  over the prostrate Dunne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston, how is it&mdash;with Rock?&rdquo; asked Dunne,
  huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, the top bullet glanced off the bone,&rdquo; replied the
  rancher. &ldquo;Ugly hole, but nothin&rsquo; fer this fellar. The leg shot,
  though, is bleedin&rsquo; bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bind it tight,&rdquo; whispered Rock.</p>

  <p>Dunne moved his head in slow action, until his cavernous eyes,
  supernaturally bright, rested upon Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Rock, it didn&rsquo;t take you long to get&mdash;heah on the
  floor with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seems long,&rdquo; said Rock, weakly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Matter of ten minutes, mebbe,&rdquo; explained Preston, as he
  wrapped and pulled with swift powerful hands. &ldquo;Hyar, somebody help
  me...hold thet end tight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rock became conscious of awakening pain, of a burning in his breast and a
  dull spreading fire in his right leg. Presently Preston rose from his task,
  wiping his bloody hands, and the voices of watchers ceased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody get Rock to town pronto,&rdquo; he said, gruffly.
  &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t safe to let him wait fer the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lon Bailey has his four-seat buckboard,&rdquo; replied a cowboy.
  &ldquo;We can take out the hind seat, an&rsquo; fix a place for Rock to
  lay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rustle now,&rdquo; replied Preston, and then bent his gloomy gaze
  down. &ldquo;Rock, if the artery ain&rsquo;t cut you&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo;
  bad. No bones broke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gage, I&rsquo;m&mdash;sorry,&rdquo; whispered Rock, faintly.
  &ldquo;No&mdash;other way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! You needn&rsquo;t be. Shore, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; rejoined the
  rancher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you&mdash;come to town?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tomorrow. Me an&rsquo; the boys will see Dabb. Mebbe it ain&rsquo;t
  too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&mdash;never&mdash;is, Preston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankin&rsquo; you. Good-bye an&rsquo; good luck,&rdquo;
  he returned, and stamped out.</p>

  <p>Rock closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, fellars, nobody hain&rsquo;t told me what happened to thet Ash
  Preston,&rdquo; spoke up Dunne. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done fer me, an&rsquo; most
  the same fer Rock. If you-all let him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daid,&rdquo; interrupted a blunt cowboy, without solemnity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Preston had the side of his haid half shot off,&rdquo; replied
  another range rider. &ldquo;Shot clean through the middle an&rsquo; then
  plumb center. He died orful hard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rock, you heah me?&rdquo; said Dunne. &ldquo;I had you
  wrong&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; pardon.... An&rsquo; fellars, if
  I have&mdash;to die&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Merciful unconsciousness did not return to Rock. When strong and gentle
  hands lifted him into the buckboard he knew agony. When the swift wheels ran
  over a bump or a rut in the road it was like a rending of flesh and bone. He
  set his teeth and endured, his brain in the vise of sensorial perceptions.
  The miles covered, the black night, the white stars, the cold&mdash;of these
  he was aware, but they meant nothing. Gray dawn and Wagontongue found him
  spent and in a daze of agony.</p>

  <p>Rock was lying in the pleasant sitting-room of the Winters&rsquo; home
  where a couch had been improvised for him. It was late in the day, according
  to the slant of the sun rays, coming through the low window above his bed. He
  had awakened to less torture, but he could move only his one arm and head. A
  fire crackled cheerfully in the small crate. Outside the window waved the
  branches of a pine tree and a soft sough of wind came strangely, like an
  accompaniment of something sad in the past.</p>

  <p>Another day Rock awoke to rest, if not ease, and slowly the stream of
  consciousness resumed its flow.</p>

  <p>The little doctor was cheerful that day. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like an
  Indian,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands in satisfaction. &ldquo;Another
  week will see you up. Then pretty soon you can fork a hoss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is your other patient?&rdquo; asked Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunne is out of danger, I&rsquo;m glad to say. But he will be a
  good while in bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sol Winter came bustling in with an armful of firewood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, son! You shore look fitter to me. How about him,
  Doc? Can we throw off the restrictions on grub an&rsquo; talk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; replied the physician, taking up his hat and
  satchel. &ldquo;Now, Rock, brighten up. You&rsquo;ve been so thick and
  gloomy. Good day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, son, I almost feel young against this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
  said Sol, cheerfully, as he kindled the fire. &ldquo;Shore is some fine
  mornin&rsquo;. First frost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, do you reckon you could shave off this brush on my chin?
  It&rsquo;s sure irritatin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll guarantee to get it off,&rdquo; replied Winter,
  with a warming laugh. &ldquo;There, we&rsquo;ll have a fire
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Mrs. Winter entered with breakfast for Rock. She was a slim, plain,
  busy little body, with gray hair, kindly eyes, and a motherly manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, Trueman!&rdquo; she greeted him, smiling. &ldquo;Sol
  says the bars are down an&rsquo; heah I&rsquo;ve rustled you fruit, rice,
  egg, toast, and coffee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother Winter, you&rsquo;re no less than an angel,&rdquo; returned
  Rock, gratefully. &ldquo;Sol, help me sit up in bed.... Oh, I can if
  you&rsquo;ll lift me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurt much?&rdquo; inquired Winter, when the desired position had
  been attained.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon&mdash;a little. Now, fetch it to me, Mother
  Winter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you hear the church bell?&rdquo; she asked, as she deposited the
  tray on his lap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Then it&rsquo;s Sunday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and another Sunday you might go to church, with a
  crutch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me go to church?... Lord, can&rsquo;t you see the congregation
  scatter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, there&rsquo;s news,&rdquo; said Winter, after his wife
  left the room. &ldquo;Might as well get it over, huh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; rejoined Rock, slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gage Preston paid me the money you gave Slagle. Yesterday, before
  he left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Left?&rdquo; echoed Rock, putting down his cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep, he left on Number Ten for Colorado,&rdquo; replied Winter,
  evidently gratified over the news he had to impart. &ldquo;Go on with your
  breakfast, son. I&rsquo;ll talk. I&rsquo;ve been wantin&rsquo; to for
  days....Rock, it all turned out better&rsquo;n we dared hope. They tell me
  Hesbitt was stubborn as a mule, but Dabb an&rsquo; Lincoln together flattened
  him out soft. I got it all from Amy, who has been most darn keen to help.
  Rock, thet little lady has a bad conscience over somethin&rsquo;.... Wal,
  with the steer market jumpin&rsquo; to seventy-five, even Hesbitt
  couldn&rsquo;t stay sore long. They fixed it up out of court. Dabb an&rsquo;
  Lincoln made it easy for Preston. They bought him out, ranch, stock,
  an&rsquo; all. Savvy those foxy ranchers! They shore had a chance an&rsquo;
  they fell on it like a turkey on a grasshopper. Cost Preston somethin&rsquo;
  big to square up, but at thet he went away heeled. I seen him at the
  station.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he go&mdash;alone?&rdquo; asked Rock, gazing away out of the
  window at the distant pine slopes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. His three grown sons were with him. All slicked up. Shore is an
  adventure for them. Looked to me they didn&rsquo;t care much. At thet,
  there&rsquo;s darned little gossip. The rest of the Prestons are in town, but
  I haven&rsquo;t seen them. Funny Thiry doesn&rsquo;t run in to see me. I met
  Sam Whipple&rsquo;s wife. She saw Thiry an&rsquo; Alice, who are
  stayin&rsquo; at Farrell&rsquo;s. She said she couldn&rsquo;t see much sign
  of Thiry&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; Ash&rsquo;s death very hard. Thet shore stumped
  me. But Thiry is game.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon she&mdash;they&rsquo;ll all be leavin&rsquo; soon,&rdquo;
  returned Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll find out pronto. If they
  <i>did</i> leave, like the old man, without seein&rsquo; you, or at least one
  word of thanks&mdash;wal, I&rsquo;ll change my idee of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, you can&rsquo;t expect them to thank me
  for&mdash;depletin&rsquo; their family somewhat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean thet.... Wal, I&rsquo;ll go out an&rsquo; do
  some work around the barn. First off, though, I&rsquo;d better shave your
  whiskers. There&rsquo;s likely to be callers, an&rsquo; shore Amy,
  &rsquo;cause she said so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sol, I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody,&rdquo; replied Rock,
  hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;m shore sorry, but I&rsquo;ll be darned if you
  won&rsquo;t have to. Suppose, for instance, Thiry would call!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re loco&mdash;Sol,&rdquo; choked Rock. &ldquo;She
  couldn&rsquo;t stand sight of me....
  Please&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I may be loco, at thet,&rdquo; replied Winter, with remorse,
  and evidently he controlled desires to argue the point.</p>

  <p>He went out, leaving Rock prey to rediscovered emotions, stronger, darker
  for the sad resignation. He had sacrificed his love to save Thiry&rsquo;s
  father, and therefore her, from ignominy. The thing could not have been
  helped. It had from the very first, that day in the corral here at
  Wagontongue, been fixed, and as fateful as the beautiful passion Thiry had
  roused in him. He had no regret. He would not have changed it, at cost to
  her. But with the accepted catastrophe faced now, there came pangs that
  dwarfed those of gunshot wounds. His heart would not break, because he had
  wonderful assurance of her love, of the sacrifice she had tried to make for
  him. How that memory stung and vibrated over him! His sluggish blood stirred
  to swift heat. She would go away with her family, and in some other state
  recover from this disaster, forget, and touch happiness, perhaps with some
  fortunate man who might win her regard. But she owed that to him. And he
  realized that when the poignancy of first grief had softened, he would find
  melancholy consolation in the memory of the service he had rendered her.</p>

  <p>Who was Trueman Rock, to aspire to the possession of Thiry Preston? Who
  was he but a lonely man, a rider that had always been and ever would be a
  rolling stone, good only to use his fatal gift in summary justice on some
  worthless scoundrel of the range?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, lady to see you,&rdquo; announced Winter, not long after he
  had made Rock presentable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Rock, with a start that seemed to rend his
  healing wounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one but Amy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;m sleepin&rsquo; or&mdash;or
  somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; implored Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like hob he will,&rdquo; replied a gay voice from behind the door.
  And Amy entered, pretty and stylish, just a little fearful and pale, despite
  her nerve.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, how do, Amy?&rdquo; said Rock, and then he laughed.
  Amy&rsquo;s presence was always difficult to deny gladly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, are you all right?&rdquo; she asked, timidly, staring at
  his long shape under the coverlet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty good, Amy, thanks. But it was a close shave, the doctor
  says.... One inch one way for one bullet&mdash;and my artery would have been
  severed. And two inches lower for the other bullet&mdash;well, Amy, my heart
  would never have broken again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk so,&rdquo; she cried,
  shuddering, as she sat down near him, and took his hand. Her face appeared
  singularly white, almost pearly. &ldquo;Oh, Trueman, I&rsquo;ve been in a
  horrible state ever since I came home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;m sorry, Amy. How so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate to tell you, but I&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; she replied.
  &ldquo;For it was my last, miserable, horrible trick!... Trueman, the day I
  got back I met Ash Preston on the street. I told him you&mdash;you were Señor
  del Toro. He laughed in my face&mdash;called me a jealous liar. Wanted to
  kill Thiry&rsquo;s partner!... But afterward I began to fear he&rsquo;d
  believe me and I fell to worrying. It grew worse as I realized&mdash;until I
  finally suffered the tortures of the damned. You cannot imagine what I felt
  when they fetched you here&mdash;all shot up.... Trueman, I don&rsquo;t want
  to abase myself utterly in your sight, but&mdash;well, I am a chastened
  woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wildcat!&rdquo; stormed Rock, stern eyes on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Trueman. After all, he didn&rsquo;t kill you&mdash;as I
  hoped in my madness. And out of evil, good has come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was wicked, Amy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know?... It made me merciless to myself. It opened my
  eyes. I told my husband, and since then we&rsquo;ve grown closer than we ever
  were.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, Amy, I forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Quick as a bird she pecked at his cheek, to lift a flushing, radiant face.
  &ldquo;There! The first sisterly one I ever gave you.... Trueman, I am the
  bearer of good news. You are a big man now. Yes, sir, in spite of&mdash;or
  perhaps because of&mdash;that awful gun of yours. But your honesty has gone
  farther with John and Tom Lincoln. I have the pleasure of telling you that
  you&rsquo;ve been chosen to run the Sunset Pass Ranch for them. On
  shares.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never, Amy, never!&rdquo; cried Rock, shivering. &ldquo;I shall
  leave Wagontongue again&mdash;soon as I can walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not if <i>we</i> all know it,&rdquo; she retorted, as she rose,
  with inscrutable eyes on him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got more friends than you
  think.... Now I&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;ve excited you enough today. But
  I&rsquo;ll come again soon. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Winter came in, upon Mrs. Dabb&rsquo;s departure, with humorous remarks
  that in no wise deceived Rock. His friends were all very good and kind, but
  they left him indifferent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; asked a girl&rsquo;s high voice, with an
  accompanying tap on the open door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he looks powerful ferocious, but I reckon you can risk
  comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Winter.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Alice Preston entered, gayly gowned, and far brighter of eye
  than Rock would have expected to see her that day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Señor, may one pay one&rsquo;s respects?&rdquo; she asked, coming
  to his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allie, you&mdash;well, I almost said, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
  Rock, suddenly warmed by surprise and gratitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, you&rsquo;re just a day late,&rdquo; she said, roguishly.
  &ldquo;I became engaged yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allie&mdash;Preston!&rdquo; ejaculated Rock. &ldquo;You&mdash;only
  sixteen years old!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother said the same thing. But Dad didn&rsquo;t know anything
  about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the lucky boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charlie Farrell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allie dear, I don&rsquo;t know that I ought to allow this,&rdquo;
  said Rock, gravely, &ldquo;but seein&rsquo; I&rsquo;m crippled an&rsquo;
  can&rsquo;t very well stop it, I&rsquo;ll say bless you, my child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat down on the bed and took his hand in both hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, I think you&rsquo;d make a good dad at that.... Does my
  news cheer you up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure does, Allie&mdash;for you.... I can never cheer up again for
  myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in sweet derision. Indeed, she was
  wholly amazing and inexplicable to Rock. He wondered if she had any other
  news. He wondered at a hint of suppressed excitement behind her smiling,
  talkative manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you leavin&rsquo; Wagontongue soon?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me? I guess not. Do you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But a squeak of the door and a deep expulsion of breath from some one
  entering checked her. Rock gave such a start that his stiff injured leg
  actually reminded him of its condition. Thiry had entered. She leaned against
  the wall. She was bareheaded, and her soft hat dropped from nerveless
  hands.</p>

  <p>Alice gave Rock&rsquo;s hand a thrilling squeeze and jumped up.
  &ldquo;Reckon this is no place for sister Allie!&rdquo; and she beat a
  precipitous retreat, closing the door behind her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry!&mdash;how good&mdash;of you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Haltingly she approached, as if the impelling force that drew her was only
  slightly stronger than something which held her back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, are you&mdash;all right?&rdquo; she asked, apparently awed
  at the helpless length of him there on the bed. She, too, sat down beside
  him, and her eyes, black with thought and pain, followed her reaching hand,
  to rest on the coverlet over his knee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most all right&mdash;now,&rdquo; he
  replied, sensitive to her touch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Winter told me everything,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but
  <i>seeing</i> you is so strange.... Can you move?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. All but my left leg.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was that broken?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m glad to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you can ride again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the other hurt&mdash;was that here?&rdquo; she asked, pale,
  almost reverent, as she laid a soft hand high upon his left shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lower down&mdash;Thiry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fascinated, she gently slipped her hand down over the bandage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still lower.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then she felt the throbbing of his heart. &ldquo;But, Trueman&mdash;it
  couldn&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hurt you asked about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was speaking of your latest wounds,&rdquo; she replied. Then she
  looked him squarely in the face, which she had failed to do before. How
  tragic, deep with sorrow, yet soul-searching that gaze! It changed. &ldquo;I
  had to fight myself to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was a cold, dead,
  horrible something inside me.... But it&rsquo;s leaving!... Trueman,
  you&rsquo;re so white and thin. So helpless lying there! I&mdash;I want to
  nurse you. I should have come.... Have you suffered?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little&mdash;I reckon,&rdquo; he replied, unsteadily. &ldquo;But
  it&rsquo;s&mdash;gone now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has Amy Dabb been here?&rdquo; she asked, jealously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Today. She was very nice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nice!... Because she wheedled John Dabb to offer you the running of
  Sunset Pass Ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;I mean, just kind,&rdquo; returned Rock, uncertainly.
  He was of half a mind to believe this delirium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, you will accept that offer?&rdquo; she queried, earnestly.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what Amy says. I know it was my father&rsquo;s
  advice to Dabb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me ever go to&mdash;Sunset Pass&mdash;again? Never in this
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, you would not leave this country?&rdquo; she asked, in
  quick alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soon as I can walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> do not want to leave Sunset Pass,&rdquo; she returned,
  with spirit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t. Reckon that&rsquo;s a surprise,
  Thiry.... It&rsquo;s very beautiful&mdash;out there. Perhaps, somehow, it can
  be arranged for you. Allie is engaged to young Farrell. Isn&rsquo;t that
  fine?... Some one, of course, will take the place.... Is your mother
  leavin&rsquo; soon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is terribly angry with Dad,&rdquo; replied Thiry, seriously.
  &ldquo;You see, mother was not in the secret.... But I think some day
  she&rsquo;ll get over it&mdash;when Dad makes a new home&mdash;and go back to
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She ought to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She edged a little closer, grave and sweet, and suddenly bent over to kiss
  his knee where the bandage made a lump, and then she moved up to lay her
  cheek over his heart, with a long low sigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trueman, did you think I&rsquo;d&mdash;hate you for killing
  Ash?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>He could not speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought I would. And it was a sickening, terrible blow.... But
  before that same night was over I knew I couldn&rsquo;t hate you.... And I
  believe, even if I hadn&rsquo;t learned what changed it all, I would have
  forgiven you&mdash;some day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;changed&mdash;all?&rdquo; burst out Rock, in
  insupportable suspense.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What Dad told me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry&mdash;have mercy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ash was not my brother,&rdquo; she said, in smothered voice, and
  her hand sought his cheek.</p>

  <p>That dear bright head on his breast seemed to be lifting his heart rather
  than pressing against it. A thousand thoughts tried to pierce to clarity.</p>

  <p>Rising, Thiry slipped to the floor on her knees, and leaned upon her
  elbows, clasping his hands, regarding him with remorseful tenderness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My brother Range beat the others home that night, with the news of
  the fight. I stole to my room. Allie stayed with me. Afterward she told me I
  raged I was going out to kill you. But that was only madness.... I had my
  terrible black hours. Thank God they are past.... I knew we were
  ruined&mdash;that Ash in some way had brought it about. Perhaps my love for
  him turned then. Allie begged and pleaded and prayed with me. How she hated
  Ash! And what a friend she was to you!... But I want you to know that even
  then believing Ash my brother I&rsquo;d have forgiven you in time. I know it.
  After the agony was spent I was learning how deathlessly I loved you....
  Sometime in the night late Dad came to me. Never had I seen him gentle, sad,
  defeated, yet something better for that.... He told me not to take it too
  hard&mdash;not to visit the sins of others upon your head. You had been
  driven to kill Ash. Some one <i>had</i> to do it, for the good of all, and no
  one but you <i>could</i>. He told me how he had inflamed Ash. Then the fight!
  ... Ah, God, he did&mdash;not&mdash;spare me.... Then came the story, torn
  from his most secret heart. Ash was not his son, but the illegitimate son of
  a girl who he had loved long ago, who, abandoned and dying, gave him her
  child. That child was Ash. And Dad said he was what his father had been. ...
  I was not yet born. But when I came, Ash was my playmate. I remember when we
  were children. He was always vicious to everyone except me. And so I grew up
  loving him, perhaps for that.... Next day I went to mother, and she
  corroborated Dad&rsquo;s story. It seemed I was delivered from hellish
  bonds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thiry darlin&rsquo;&mdash;there must be somethin&rsquo; in
  prayer,&rdquo; cried Rock, fervently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was to learn how you had bought Slagle&rsquo;s silence&mdash;how
  you persuaded Dabb and Lincoln to force Hesbitt to settle out of
  court&mdash;oh, how from the very beginning you had meant good by all of us!
  Yet I could not drag myself to you. It took time. I had such dreadful fear of
  seeing you lying in danger of death, bloody, pale, with awful eyes that would
  have accused me.... Oh, I suffered!... But now I&rsquo;m here&mdash;on my
  knees.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please get up?&rdquo; asked Rock, lifting her to a seat beside
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now will you accept Dabb&rsquo;s offer and take me back to Sunset
  Pass?&rdquo; she asked, bending to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Thiry, if you will have it so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If
  you love me that well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She gave him awakening passionate proof of that. &ldquo;Dear, I understand
  better. Dad told me you were one of the marked men of the ranges. Our West is
  in the making. Such men as Ash&mdash;and those others
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sol Winter came in upon them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I knocked twice, an&rsquo; then I says I&rsquo;d better go
  in.&rdquo; He beamed down upon them. &ldquo;Son an&rsquo; lass, I&rsquo;m
  glad to see you holdin&rsquo; each other thet way&mdash;as if now you&rsquo;d
  never let go. For I&rsquo;ve grown old on the frontier, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
  seen but little of the love you have for each other. We Westerners are a hard
  pioneerin&rsquo; outfit. I see in you, an&rsquo; Allie, an&rsquo; some more
  of our young friends, a leanin&rsquo; more to finer, better
  things.&rdquo;</p>
